ITALY

PART I.—GEOGRAPHY AND STATISTICS.

Topography. ITALY , or more correctly Italia, is the name that has been applied both in ancient and modern times to the great peninsula that projects from the mass of central Europe far to the south into the Mediterranean Sea, where the great island of Sicily may be considered as in fact a mere continuation or appendage of the continental promontory. Confining ourselves, however, to Italy itself, its natural boundaries are marked with a distinctness that is quite exceptional. The portion of the Mediterranean commonly termed by geographers the Tyrrhenian Sea forms its limit on the W. and S., and the Adriatic on the E.; while to the north, where it joins the main continent of Europe, it is separated from the adjacent regions by the mighty chain of the Alps, which sweeps round in a vast semicircle from the head of the Adriatic to the shores of Nice and Monaco, presenting throughout an almost unbroken mountain barrier.

The land thus circumscribed extends between the parallels of 46° , 40' and 37° 55' N. 1at. and between 6° 35' and 18° 35' E. long. Its greatest length is from northwest to south-east, in which direction it measures 620 geographical miles or 718 English miles in a direct line from the boundary near Courmayeur to the Cape Sta Maria di Leuca, south of Otranto, but the great mountain peninsula of Calabria extends about two degrees farther south to Cape Spartivento in lat. 37° 55'. Its breadth is, owing to its configuration, very irregular. The northern portion, measured from the Alps at the Monte Viso to the mouth of the Po, has a breadth of about 230 geographical or 270 English miles, and from the Monte Viso to the head of the Adriatic near the mouth of the Isonzo it measures 290 geographical or 340 English miles. But the peninsula of Italy, which forms the largest portion of the country, nowhere exceeds 130 geographical miles in breadth, while it does not generally measure more than from 90 to 100 miles across. Its southern extremity, now called Calabria, forms a complete peninsula, being united to the mass of Lucania or the Basilicata by an isthmus of only 35 English miles in width, while that between the Gulfs of Sta Eufemia and Squillace, which connects the two portions of the province, does not exceed 20 miles. The area of the present kingdom of Italy, exclusive of the large islands, is computed at 93,640 square miles. Savoy, which until the treaty of 1860 was commonly considered as included in Italy, on account of its being comprised in the kingdom of Sardinia, as a matter of physical geography unquestionably belongs to France (to which it is now politically united), being separated from the Italian province of Piedmont by the main chain of the Alps.

But, though that great range forms throughout the northern boundary of Italy, the exact limits of the country at the two extremities of the Alpine chain are not very clearly marked, and have been subject to considerable fluctuations both in ancient and modern times. Ancient geographers appear to have generally regarded the remarkable headland which descends from the Maritime Alps to the sea between Nice and Monaco as the limit of Italy in that direction, and in a purely geographical point of view it is probably the best point that could be selected. But Augustus, who was the first to give to Italy a definite political organization, carried the frontier to the river Varus or Var, a few miles west of Nice, and this river continued in modern times to be generally recognized as the boundary between France and Italy. It was only in 1860 that the annexation of Nice and the adjoining territory to France carried the political frontier farther east, to a point between Mentone and Ventimiglia, which certainly constitutes no natural limit.

Towards the north-east also the line of demarcation is not clearly characterized. The point where the range of the Julian Alps approaches almost close to the sea-shore (just at the sources of the little stream so celebrated in ancient times as the Timavus) would seem to constitute the best natural limit. But in the constitution of Italy by Augustus the frontier was carried farther east so as to include Tergeste (Trieste), and the little river Formio (Risano) was in the first instance chosen as the limit, but this was subsequently transferred to the river Arsia (the Arsa), which flows into the Gulf of Quarnero, so as to include almost all Istria; and the circumstance that the coast of Istria was throughout the Middle Ages held by the powerful republic of Venice tended to perpetuate this arrangement, so that Istria was generally regarded as belonging to Italy, though certainly not forming any natural portion of that country.

The only other part of the northern frontier of Italy where the boundary is not clearly marked by nature is Tyrol or the valley of the Adige. Here the main chain of the Alps (as marked by the watershed) recedes so far to the north that it has never constituted, as it has done throughout the greater part of its extent, the national limit between populations of different race and language. In ancient times the upper valleys of the Adige and its tributaries were inhabited by Rhoetian tribes and included in the province of Rhoetia; and the line of demarcation between that province and Italy was purely arbitrary, as it remains to this day. Tridentum or Trent was in the time of Pliny included in the tenth region of Italy or Venetia, but he tells us that the inhabitants were a Rhoetian tribe. At the present day the frontier between Austria and the kingdom of Italy crosses the Adige about 30 miles below Trent, —that city and its territory, which previous to the treaty of Lunéville in 1802 was governed by sovereign archbishops of its own, subject only to the German emperors, being now included in the Austrian empire. While the Alps thus constitute the northern boundary of Italy, its configuration and internal geography are determined almost entirely by the great chain of the Apennines, which branches off from the Maritime Alps between Nice and Genoa, and, after stretching in the first instance in an unbroken line across from the Gulf of Genoa to the Adriatic, then turns more to the south, and is continued throughout the whole of Central and Southern Italy, of which it forms as it were the backbone, until it ends is the southernmost extremity of Calabria at Cape Spartivento. The great spur or promontory projecting towards the east to Brindisi and Otranto, which figures in the older maps of Italy as if it were constituted by a branch from the main range of the Apennines, is not in reality so formed, and has no direct connexion with the central chain.

One chief result of the manner in which the Apennines thus traverse the whole of Italy from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic is the marked division between Northern Italy, including the region north of the Apennines and extending thence to the foot of the Alps, and the central and more southerly portions of the peninsula. No such line of separation exists farther south, and the terms [9:13:435] Central and Southern Italy, though in general use among geographers, and convenient for descriptive purposes, do not correspond to any natural divisions of the great Italian peninsula.

1. Northern Italy.— By far the larger portion of Northern Italy is occupied by the basin of the Po, which comprises the whole of the broad plain extending from the foot of the Apennines to that of the Alps, together with the valleys and slopes on both sides of it. Throughout its whole course indeed, from its source in Monte Viso to its outflow into the Adriatic—a distance of more than 5 degrees of longitude, or 220 miles in a direct line—the Po receives all the waters that flow from the Apennines northwards, and all those that descend from the Alps towards the south, till one comes to the Adige, which, after pursuing a parallel course with the Po for a considerable distance, enters the Adriatic by a separate mouth.

There is no other instance in Europe of a basin of similar extent equally clearly characterized,—the perfectly level character of the plain being as striking as the boldness with which the lower slopes of the mountain ranges begin , to rise on each side of it. This is most clearly marked on the side of the Apennines, where the great Emilian Way, which has been the high road from the time of the Romans to our own, preserves an unbroken straight line from Rimini to Piacenza, a distance of more than 150 miles, during which the underfalls of the mountains continually approach it on the left, without once crossing the line of road. On the side of the Alps the boundary is more varied and broken, the great projecting masses of those mountains being intersected by large rivers, which produce valleys of considerable extent running far up into the mountains. But still, from whatever point the traveller approaches the Alps, he will be struck by the manner in which the unbroken alluvial plain extends quite up to the foot of the actual mountains or their immediate offshoots,—presenting in this respect a striking contrast with the broken, hilly country which is found on the north side of the Alps both in Switzerland and in Austria.

The only exception to this uniform level occurs in the Monferrat region, which consists principally of hills of moderate elevation and of Tertiary formation, projecting to the north from the Ligurian Apennines, and occupying a breadth of about 50 miles from the neighbourhood of Turin to that of Alessandria, around which the Po is compelled to form a great bend between Turin and Valenza, leaving, however, a broad strip of plain (from 15 to 30 miles across) between its north bank and the foot of the Alps. The detached group of the Euganean hills, within sight of the Adriatic, though separated from the nearest Alps by a very narrow strip of plain, is wholly independent of that great chain, and forms a separate and isolated mass of volcanic origin.

The geography of Northern Italy will be best described by following the course of the Po. That mighty stream has its origin as a mountain torrent descending from two little dark lakes on the north flank of Monte Viso, at a height of more than 6000 feet above the sea; and after a course of less than 20 miles it enters the plain at Saluzzo, between which and Turin, a distance of only 30 miles, it receives three considerable tributaries,—the Clusone on its left bank, bringing down the waters from the valley of Fenestrelle, and the Varaita and Maira on the south, contributing those of two valleys of the Alps immediately south of that of the Po itself. Between Turin and Valenza it receives no affluent of importance on its right bank, but a few miles below the latter town it is joined by the Tanaro, a large stream, which brings with it the united waters of the Stura, the Bormida, and several minor rivers. All these have their sources on the northern flank or reverse of the Maritime Alps, where the chain bends round towards Savona, and being fed by the snows of those lofty mountains are greatly superior in volume to the rivers that descend from the Apennines farther east.

But far more important are the great rivers that descend from the main chain of the Graian and Pennine Alps, and join the Po on its left bank. Of these the Dora (called for distinction’s sake Dora Riparia), which unites with the greater river just below Turin, has its source in the Mont Genevre, and flows past Susa at the foot of the Mont Cenis. Next comes the Stura, which rises in the glaciers of the Roche Melon; then the Oreo, flowing through the Vai di Locana; and then the Dora Baltea, one of the greatest of all the Alpine tributaries of the Po, which has its source in the glaciers of Mont Blanc, above Courmayeur, and thence descends through the Vai d’Aosta for about 70 miles till it enters the plain at Ivrea, and after flowing about 20 miles more joins the Po a few miles below Chivasso. This great valley—one of the most considerable on the southern side of the Alps—has attracted more especial attention, in ancient as well as modern times, from its leading to two of the most frequented passes across the great mountain chain,—the Great and the Little St Bernard, the former diverging at Aosta, and crossing the main ridges to the north into the valley of the Rhone, the other following a more westerly direction into Savoy. In its course below Aosta also the Dora Baltea receives several considerable tributaries, which descend from the range of glaciers between Mont Blanc and Monte Rosa.

About 25 miles below its confluence with the Dora, the Po receives the waters of the Sesia, also a large river, which has its source above Alagna at the southern foot of Monte Rosa, and after flowing by Varallo and Vercelli falls into the Po about 14 miles below the latter city. About 30 miles east of this confluence,—in the course of which the Po makes a great bend south to Valenza, and then returns again to the northward,—it is joined by the Ticino, a large and rapid river, which brings with it the outflow of the great lake called the Lago Maggiore, and all the accumulated waters that· flow into it. Of these the Ticino itself has its source about 10 miles above Airolo at the foot of the St Gotthard, and after flowing above 36 miles through the Vai Leventina to Bellinzona, where it is joined by the Moesa bringing down the waters of the Vai Misocco, enters the lake through a marshy plain at Magadino, about 10 miles distant. On the west side of the lake the Toccia or Tosa descends from the pass of the Gries nearly due south to Domo d’Ossola, where it receives the waters of the Doveria from the Simplon, and a few miles lower down those of the Vai Anzasca from the foot of Monte Rosa, and 12 miles farther has its outlet into the lake between Baveno and Pallanza. Besides these two great streams the Lago Maggiore is the receptacle of the waters of two minor but considerable lakes—the Lago di Lugano on the east and the Lago d’Orta on the west. The Ticino has a course of above 50 miles from Sesto Calende, where it issues from the lake, through the level, plain, till it joins the Po just below the city of Pavia.

The next great affluent of the Po, the Adda, forms in like manner the outflow of a great lake—the Lake of Como, and has also its sources far away in the Alps, above Bormio, from whence it flows through the broad and fertile valley of the Vai Tellina for a distance of more than 65 miles till it enters the lake near Colico. The Adda in this part of its course has a direction almost due east to west; but at the same point where it reaches the lake, another river, the Lira, descends the valley of S. Giacomo, which runs nearly north and south from the pass of the Splügen, thus affording one of the most direct lines of communication across the Alps. The Adda flows out of [9:13:436] the lake at its south-eastern extremity at Lecco, and has thence a course through the plain of above 70 miles till it enters the Po between Piacenza and Cremona. In this part of its course it flows by Lodi and Pizzighettone, and receives the waters of two minor but considerable streams, the Brembo, descending from the Vai Brembana, and the Serio from the Vai Seriana above Bergamo. The Oglio, a more considerable stream than either of the last two, rises in the Monte Tonale above Edolo, and descends through the Vai Camonica to Lovere, where it expands into a large lake, called the Lake of Iseo from the town of that name on its southern shore. Issuing from thence at its southwest extremity, the Oglio has a long and winding course through the plain before it finally reaches the Po a few miles above Borgoforte. In this lower part of its course it receives the smaller streams of the Melia, which flows by Brescia, and the Chiese, which proceeds from a small lake called the Lago d'Idro, between the Lake of Iseo and that of Garda.

The last of the great tributaries of the Po is the Mincio, which flows from the Lago di Garda, the largest of all the Italian lakes, and has a course of about 40 miles from Peschiera, where it issues from the lake at its south-eastern angle, till its joins the Po. About 12 miles above the confluence it passes under the walls of Mantua, and expands into a broad lake-like reach so as entirely to encircle that city. Nothwithstanding its extent, the Lake of Garda is not fed, like those of Como and Maggiore, by the snows of the high Alps, nor is the stream which enters it at its northern extremity (at Riva) commonly known as the Mincio, though in reality forming the main source of that river, but is termed the Sarca; it rises at the foot of the Monte Tonale.

The Adige, which is formed by the junction of two streams—the Etsch or Adige proper and the Eisach, both of which belong to Tyrol rather than to Italy—descends as far as Verona, where it enters the great plain, with a course from north to south nearly parallel to the rivers last described, and would seem likely in like manner to discharge its waters into those of the Po, but below Legnago it turns to the eastward and pursues a course parallel to that of the Po itself for a space of about 40 miles, till it enters the Adriatic by an independent mouth about 8 miles from the northern outlet of the greater stream. The waters of the two rivers have, however, been made to communicate by artificial cuts and canals in more than one place.

The Po itself, which is here a very large stream, with an average width of from 400 to 600 yards, continues to flow with an undivided mass of waters as far as a place called Sta Maria di Ariano, where it parts into two arms, known as the Po della Maestra and Po di Goro, and these again are subdivided into several other branches, forming an extensive delta above 20 miles in width from north to south. The point of bifurcation is at present about 25 miles from the sea, but was formerly much farther inland, more than 10 miles west of Ferrara, where a small arm of the river, still called the Po di Ferrara, branches off from the main stream. Previous to the year 1154 this channel was the main stream, and the two small branches into which it subdivides, called the Po di Volano and Po di Primaro, were in early times the two main outlets of the great river. The southernmost of these, the Po di Primaro, enters the Adriatic only about 12 miles north of Ravenna, so that if these two arms be included, the whole delta of the Po extends through a space of about 36 miles from south to north. The whole course of the river, including its windings, is estimated at about 450 miles.

Besides the delta of the Po and the large marshy tracts which it forms, there exist on both sides of it extensive lagoons of salt water, generally separated from the Adriatic by narrow strips of sand or embankments, partly natural partly artificial, but having openings from distance to distance through these barriers, which admit of the influx and efflux of the sea-water, and serve as ports for communication with the mainland. The best known and the most extensive of these lagoons is that in which Venice is situated, and which extends from Torcello in the north to Chioggia and Brondolo in the south, a distance of above 40 miles; but they were formerly much more extensive, and afforded a continuous means of internal navigation, by what were called “the Seven Seas” (Septem Maria), from Ravenna to Altinum, a few miles north of Torcello. That city, like Ravenna, originally stood in the midst of a lagoon; and the coast to the east of it, the whole way to near Monfalcone, where it meets the mountains, is occupied by similar expanses of water, which are, however, continually drying up and becoming gradually converted into dry land. The changes in the coast-line have consequently been considerable throughout this extent.

The tract in the interior, adjoining this long line of lagoons, is, like the basin of the Po, a broad expanse of perfectly level alluvial plain, extending from the Adige eastwards to the Carnic Alps, where they approach close to the Adriatic between Aquileia and Trieste, and northwards to the foot of the great chain, which here sweeps round in a semicircle from the neighbourhood of Vicenza to that of Aquileia. The space thus included was known in ancient times as Venetia, a name applied in the Middle Ages to the well-known city; the eastern portion of it became known in the Middle Ages as the Frioul or Friuli. It is traversed by a number of rivers, descending from the Alpine chain; but these are for the most part nothing more than mountain torrents, bringing down vast masses of stones and shingle to the plain below. Beginning from the Adige and proceeding from west to east the streams worthy of notice are—(1) the Brenta, a navigable stream of a different character from the rest, which descends from the Vai Sugana, and passes within a few miles of Padua; (2) the Piave, flowing by Belluno; (3) the Tagliamento, which descends from the Carnic Alps above Tolmezzo, and though a large stream has a very torrent-like character; (4) the Isonzo, a deep and rapid river, which has its sources in the highest group of the Julian Alps, at the foot of Mont Terglou, and brings with it the waters of the Natisone, also a considerable stream.

Returning to the south of the Po, the tributaries of that river on its right bank below the Tanaro are very inferior .in volume and importance to those from the north. Flowing from the Ligurian Apennines, which are of no great elevation and never attain to the limit of perpetual snow, they have no continuous supply through the year, and in summer generally dwindle into insignificant streams flowing through dry beds of shingle. Beginning from the Tanaro, the principal of them are—(1) the Scrivia, a small but rapid stream flowing from the Apennines at the back of Genoa; (2) the Trebbia, a much larger river, though of the same torrent-like character, which rises near Torriglia within 20 miles of Genoa, flows by Bobbio, and joins the Po a few miles above Piacenza; (3) the Nure, a few miles east of the preceding; (4) the Taro, a more considerable stream; (5) the Parma, flowing by the city of the same name; (6) the Enza; (7) the Secchia, which flows by Modena; (8) the Panaro, a few miles to the east of that city; (9) the Reno, which flows by Bologna, but instead of holding its course till it discharges its waters into the Po, is turned aside by an artificial channel into the Po di Primaro. The other small streams east of this—of which the most considerable are the Solaro, the Santerno, flowing by Imola, the Lamone by Faenza, the Montone by Forb —all have their outlet in like manner into the Po di [9:13:437] Primaro, or by artificial mouths into the Adriatic between Ravenna and Rimini. The river Marecchia, which enters the sea immediately north of Rimini, may be considered as the natural limit of Northern Italy. It was adopted by Augustus as the boundary of Gallia Cispadana; the far-famed Rubicon was a trifling stream a few miles farther north, now called Fiumicino.

The narrow strip of coast-land between the Maritime Alps, the Apennines, and the sea—called in ancient times Liguria, and now known as the Riviera of Genoa— though belonging itι respect of latitude to Northern Italy, is in other respects quite distinct from the region included under that name. Throughout its whole extent, from Nice to Genoa on the one side, and again from Genoa to Spezia on the other, it is almost wholly mountainous, being occupied by the branches and offshoots of the mountain ranges at the back, which separate it throughout from the great plain to the north, while they send down their lateral ridges close to the water’s edge, leaving only in places a few square miles of level plains at the mouths of the rivers and openings of the valleys. Rugged as it is, the district thus bounded is by no means devoid of fertility, the steep slopes facing the south enjoying so fine a climate as to render them very favourable for the growth of fruit trees, especially the olive, which is cultivated in terraces to a considerable height up the face of the mountains, while the openings of the valleys are generally occupied by towns or villages.

From the proximity of the mountains to the sea none of the rivers in this part of Italy have any long course, and they are generally mere mountain torrents, rapid and swollen in winter and spring, and almost dry in summer. The lrrgest and most important are those which descend from the Maritime Alps between Nice and Albenga. Beginning from the Var, which as already stated is now included in France, the most considerable of them are—the Roja, which rises in the Col di Tenda, and descends to Ventimiglia; the Taggia, between San Remo and Oneglia: and the Centa, which enters the sea at Albenga. The other streams, which flow from the range of the Apennines to the sea between Savona and Genoa, are of very little importance, from the proximity of the watershed and its small elevation. The same remark applies to the Riviera east of Genoa, where the Lavagna, which enters the sea at Chiavari, is the only stream of any importance between Genoa and the Gulf of Spezia. But immediately east of that inlet (a remarkable instance of a deep land-locked gulf with no river flowing into it) the Magra, which descends from Pontremoli down the valley known as the Lunigiana, is a large stream, and brings with it the waters of another considerable stream, the Vara. The Magra (Macra) was in ancient times the boundary between Liguria and Etruria, and may be considered as constituting on this side the limit of Northern Italy.

The Apennines, as has been already mentioned, here traverse the whole breadth of Italy, cutting off the peninsula properly so termed from the broader mass of Northern Italy by a continuous barrier of considerable breadth, though of far inferior elevation to that of the Alps. The Ligurian Apennines, which may be considered as taking their rise in the neighbourhood of Savona, where a pass of very moderate elevation connects them with the Maritime Alps, of which they are in fact only a continuation, are among the least lofty portions of that long range. From the neighbourhood of Savona to that of Genoa they do not rise to more than 3000 to 4000 feet, and are traversed by passes of less than 2000 feet. As they extend towards the east they increase in elevation: thus Monte Penna, at the sources of the Taro, rises to 5704 feet; Monte Molinadigo, at the head of the valley of Pontremoli, to 5100; and the Alpe di Succisa, near the pass which is crossed by the road from Sarzana to Reggio, to 6600; while the Monte Cimone, a little farther east, attains to the height of 7088 feet. This is the highest point in the northern Apennines, and belongs to a group of summits of nearly equal altitude; the range which from thence is continued between Tuscany and what are now known as the Emilian provinces has a very uniform character both in elevation and direction, and presents a continuous ridge from the mountains at the head of the Vai di Mugello (due north of Florence) to the point where they are traversed by the celebrated Furlo Pass. The highest point in this part of the range is the Monte Falterona, above the sources of the Arno, which attains to a height of 5408 feet. Throughout this tract the Apennines are generally covered with extensive forests of chestnut, oak, and beech; while their upper slopes afford admirable pasturage. But few towns of any importance are found either on their northern or southern declivity, and the· former region especially, though occupying a broad tract of from 30 to 40 miles in width, between the crest of the Apennines and the plain of the Po, is one of the least known and at the same time least interesting portions of Italy.

2. Central Italy.— It has already been observed that, this term is merely one used by geographers as a matter of convenience, and does not correspond to any natural division of the peninsula. Nor does it correspond with any received political division, for though the kingdom of Naples, which so long constituted a separate government, might be considered as representing Southern Italy, its three northern provinces, known as the Abruzzi, certainly belong rather to the central portion of the peninsula, with which they correspond in physical characters as well as in. latitude and position. Writers on ancient geography generally include Campania and Samnium also in Central Italy, a division rendered convenient by the close relations existing between those countries and Latium, the political centre of Italy in those days. But as a mere geographical division it seems more convenient to include all the provinces that formed part of the kingdom of Naples, with the exception of the three Abruzzi, in Southern Italy.

The geography of Central Italy is almost wholly determined by the great range of the Apennines, which traverse its whole extent in a direction from about north-north-east to south-south-west, almost precisely parallel to that of the coast of the Adriatic from Rimini to Pescara. The line of the highest summits and of the watershed ranges at a distance of about 30 to 40 miles from the Adriatic, while it is separated by about double that distance from the Tyrrhenian Sea on the west. It is in this part of the range that almost all the highest points of the Apennines are found. Beginning from the group called the Alpi della Luna near the sources of the Tiber, which attain only to a height of 4435 feet, they are continued by the Monte Nerone (5014 feet), Monte Catria (5590), and Monte Maggio to the Monte Penino near Nocera (5169 feet), and thence to the Monte della Sibilla, at the source of the N#r or Nera, which attains an elevation of 7663 feet. Proceeding from thence southwards, we find in succession the Monte Λ 7 ettore (8134 feet), the Pizzo di Sevo (7945 feet), and the two great mountain masses of the Monte Corno, commonly called the Gran Sasso d’Italia, the most lofty of all the Apennines, attaining to a height of 9522 feet, and the Monte della Majella, but little inferior, its highest summit measuring 9084 feet. Farther south than this the range decreases in altitude, and no very lofty summits are found till we come to the group of Monte Matese, in Samnium (6660 feet), which according to the division here adopted belongs to Southern Italy. But [9:13:438] besides the lofty central masses above enumerated, two other peaks deserve mention which, though outliers from the main range, and separated from it by valleys of considerable extent, rise to a height exceeding that of all but a few of the points already cited. These are the Monte Terminillo, near Leonessa (7278 feet), and the Monte Velino near the Lake Fucino, rising to 8192 feet, both of which are covered with snow from November till May, and being within sight of Rome are familiar objects to most visitors to Italy. But though the Apennines of Central Italy, viewed in the mass, may be considered as thus constituting a continuous range, they are far from having the definite arrangement which characterizes their northern extension from the neighbourhood of Genoa to the Adriatic. Instead of presenting, like the Alps and the northern Apennines, a definite central ridge, with transverse valleys leading down from it on both sides, the central Apennines in reality constitute a mountain mass of very considerable breadth, composed of a number of minor ranges and groups of mountains, which though very broken and irregular preserve a, generally parallel direction, and are separated by upland valleys, some of them of considerable extent as well as considerable elevation above the sea. Such is the basin of the Lake Fucino, situated in the very centre of the whole mass, and almost exactly midway between the two seas, but at an elevation of 2180 feet above them; while the upper valley of the Aterno, in which Aquila is situated, is not less than 2380 feet above the level of the sea. Still more elevated is the valley of the Gizio (a tributary of the Aterno), of which Sulmona is the chief town, and which communicates with the upper valley of the Sangro by a level plain called the Piano di Cinqua Miglia, at an elevation of not less than 4298 feet, regarded as the most wintry spot in Italy. Nor do the highest summits ever form a continuous ridge of great altitude for any considerable distance; they are rather a series of groups separated by intervals of very inferior elevation forming natural passes across the range, and broken in some places (as is the case in almost all limestone countries) by the waters from the upland valleys turning suddenly at right angles, and breaking through the mountain ranges which bound them. Thus the two loftiest groups of all, the Gran Sasso and the Majella, are separated by the deep valley of the Aterno, while the Tronto, in like manner, breaks through the range between Monte Vettore and the Pizzo di Sevo. This constitution of the great mass of the central Apennines has in all ages exercised an important influence upon the character of this portion of Italy, which may be considered as divided by nature into two great regions, a cold and barren upland country, bordered on both sides by rich and fertile tracts, enjoying a warm but temperate climate.

The district west of the Apennines, extending from the foot of the mountains to the sea, which constitutes a region of great beauty and fertility, though inferior in productiveness t·o northern Italy, may be considered as coinciding in a general way with the countries so familiar to all students of ancient history as Etruria and Latium. In modern times (until the recent union of all Italy) they were comprised in Tuscany and the southern Papal States. The northern part of Tuscany is indeed occupied to a considerable extent by the underfalls and offshoots of the Apennines, which, besides the ordinary slopes and spurs of the main range that constitutes its northern frontier towards the plain of the Po, throw off several outlying ranges or groups, which attain to a very considerable elevation. Of these the most remarkable fø the group between the valleys of the Serchio and the Magra, commonly known as the mountains of Carrara, from the celebrated marble quarries in the vicinity of that city. Two of the summits of this group, the Pizzo d’Uccello and the Pania della Croce, attain to 6155 and 6100 feet. Another lateral range, the Prato Magno, which branches off from the central chain at the Monte Falterona, and separates the upper valley of the Arno from its second basin, rises to 5188 feet; while a similar branch, called the Alpe della Catenaja, of inferior elevation, divides the upper course of the Arno from that of the Tiber.

The rest of this tract is for the most part a hilly, broken country, but does not in general rise into anything like mountains, with the exception of the Monte Amiata, near Radicofani, a lofty isolated’ mass of volcanic origin, which attains to a height of 5650 feet. South of this the country between the frontier of Tuscany and the Tiber is in great part of volcanic origin, forming hills of no great elevation, with distinct crater-shaped basins, in several instances occupied by small lakes (the Lake of Bolsena, Lake of Vico, and Lake of Bracciano); and this volcanic tract extends across the Campagna of Rome, till it rises again in the lofty group of the Alban hills, the highest summit of which, the Monte Cavo, is 3160 feet above the sea. In this part the Apennines are separated from the sea by a space of only about 30 miles in width, occupied by the undulating volcanic plain of the Roman Campagna, -from which the mountains rise in a wall-like barrier, of which the highest point, the Monte Gennaro, attains to a height of 4165 feet. South of Palestrina again, the main mass of the Apennines throws off another lateral mass, known in ancient times as the Volscian mountains (now called the Monti Lepini), separated from the central ranges by the broad valley of the Sacco, a tributary of the Liris or Garigliano, and forming a large and rugged mountain mass, nearly 5000 feet in height, which descends to the sea at Terracina, and between that point and the mouth of the Liris throws out several rugged mountain headlands, which may be considered as constituting the natural boundary between Latium and Campania, and consequently the natural limit of Central Italy. But besides these offshoots of the Apennines there are in this part of Central Italy several detached mountains, rising almost like islands on the sea-shore, of which the two most remarkable are the Monte Argentaro on the coast of Tuscany near Orbetello (2087 feet high) and the Monte Circello (1771 feet) at the angle of the Pontine Marshes, by the whole breadth of which it is separated from the Volscian Apennines.

The two valleys of the Arno and the Tiber (called in Italian Teuere) may be considered as furnishing the key to the geography of all this portion of Italy west of the •Apennines. The Arno, which has its source in the Monte Falterona, one of the most elevated summits of the main chain of the Tuscan Apennines, flows at first nearly south till in the neighbourhood of Arezzo it turns abruptly to the north-west, and pursues that course as far as Pontassieve, where it again makes a sudden bend to the west, and pursues a westerly course from thence to the sea, passing through the two celebrated cities of Florence and. Pisa. Its principal tributary is the Sieve, which joins it at Pontassieve, bringing down the waters of the Vai di Mugello. The Elza and the Era, which join it on its right bank, descending from the hills near Siena and Volterra, are inconsiderable streams; and the Serchio, which flows from the territory of Lucca and the Alpi Apuani, and formerly joined the Arno a few miles from its mouth, now enters the sea by a separate channel. The most considerable rivers of Tuscany south of the Arno are the Cecina, which flows through the plain below Volterra, and the Ombrone, which rises in the hills near Siena, and enters the sea about 12 miles below Grosseto.

The Tiber, a much more important river than the Arno, and the largest in Italy with the exception of the Po, rises in the Apennines, about 20 miles east of the source of [9:13:439] the Amo, and ∩ows nearly south by Borgo S. Sepolcro and Città, di Castello, then between Perugia and Todi to Orte, just below which it receives the waters of the Nera. Its tributaries in the upper part of its course are of little importance, but the Nera, which rises in the lofty group of the Monte della Sibilla, is a very considerable stream, and brings with it the waters of the Velino (with its tributaries the Turano and the Salto), which joins it a few miles below its celebrated waterfall at Terni. The Teverone or Anio, which enters the Tiber a few miles above Rome, is a very inferior stream to the Nera, but brings down a considerable body of water from the mountains above Subiaco. It is a singular fact in the geography of Central Italy that the valley of the Tiber and that of the Arno are in some measure connected by that of the Chiana, a level and marshy tract, the waters from which flow partly into the Arno and partly into the Tiber.

The eastern declivity of the central Apennines towards the Adriatic is far less interesting and varied than the western. The central range here approaches (as has been already pointed out) much nearer to the sea, and hence, with few exceptions, the rivers that flow from it ha√e but short courses and are of comparatively little importance. They may be briefly enumerated, proceeding from Rimini southwards :—(1) the Foglia; (2) the Metauro, of historical celebrity, and affording access to one of the most frequented passes of the Apennines; (3) the Esino; (4) the Potenza; (5) the Chienti; (6) the Aso; (7) the Tronto; (8) the Vomano; (9) the Aterno; (10) the Sangro; (11) the Trign∩, which forms the boundary of the southernmost province of the Abruzzi, and may therefore be taken as the limit of Central Italy. Much the most considerable of these rivers is the Aterno (called also the Pescara, from the city of that name at its mouth); this has its sources in the Apennines above Aquila, and flows through a broad upland valley in a south-east direction for above 40 miles till it approaches Popoli, when it turns abruptly to the north-east, and cuts directly through the main chain of the Apennines between the range of the Gran Sasso and that of the Majella, descending with a very rapid course till it enters the sea at Pescara.

The whole of this portion of Central Italy, between the Apennines and the sea, is a hilly country, much broken and cut up by the torrents from the mountains, but fertile, especially in fruit-trees, olives, and vines; and hence it has been, both in ancient and modern times, a populous district, containing many small towns though no great cities. Its chief disadvantage is the absence of ports, the coast preserving an almost unbroken straight line, with the single exception of Ancona, which has in all ages been the only port worthy of the name on the eastern coast of Central Italy.

3. Southern Italy.— The great central mass of the Apennines, which has held its course throughout Central Italy, with a general direction from north-west to southeast, may be considered as continued in the same direction for about 100 miles farther, from the basin-shaped group of the Monti del Matese (which rises to the height of 6660 feet) to the neighbourhood of Potenza, in the heart of the province of Basilicata, corresponding nearly to the ancient Lucania. The whole of the district known in ancient times as Samnium (a part of which still retains the name of Sannio, though now officially designated as the province of Molise) is occupied by an irregular mass of mountains, of much inferior height to those of Central Italy, and having still less of the character of a regular range, being broken up into a number of groups or masses, intersected by rivers, which have for the most part a very tortuous course. This mountainous tract, which has an average breadth of from 50 to 60 miles, is bounded on the west by the plain of Campania, now called the Terra di Lavoro, and on the east by the much broader and more extensive tract of Apulia or Puglia, composed partly of level plains, but for the most part of undulating downs of very slight elevation, and contrasting strongly with the mountain ranges of the Apennines, which rise abruptly above them. The central mass of the mountains, however, throws out two outlying ranges, the one to the west, which separates the Bay of Naples from that of Salerno, and culminates in the Monte St Angelo above Castellamare (4720 feet), while the detached volcanic cone of Vesuvius, which rises to near 4000 feet, is isolated from the neighbouring mountains by an intervening strip of plain. On the east side in like manner the Monte Gargano, a detached limestone mass which rises to the height of 5120 feet, and projects in a bold spur-like promontory into the Adriatic, forming the only break in the otherwise uniform coast-line of Italy on that sea, though separated from the great body of the Apennines by a considerable interval of low country, may be considered as merely an outlier from the central mass.

From the neighbourhood of Potenza, the main ridge of the Apennines is continued by the Monti della Maddalena in a direction nearly due south, so that it approaches within a short distance of the Gulf of Polieastro, from whence it is carried on as far as the Monte Pollino, the last of the lofty summits of the Apennine chain, which exceeds 7000 feet in height. The range is, however, continued through the whole of the province now called Calabria, to the southern extremity or “toe” of Italy, but presents in this part a very much altered character, the broken limestone range which is the true continuation of the chain as far as the neighbourhood of Nicastro and Catanzaro, and keeps close to the west coast, being flanked on the east by a great mass of granitic mountains, rising to a height of about 6000 feet, and covered with vast forests, from which it derives the name of La Sila. A similar mass, but separated from the preceding by a low neck of Tertiary hills, fills up the whole of the peninsular extremity of Italy from Squillace to Reggio. Its highest point, called Aspromonte, attains to a height of 4300 feet.

While the rugged and mountainous district of Calabria, extending nearly due south for a distance of more than 150 miles, thus derives its character and configuration almost wholly from the range of the Apennines, by which it is traversed from end to end, the case is wholly different with the long spur-like promontory which projects towards the east to Brindisi and Otranto. The older maps of Italy, indeed, with one accord represent the Apennines as bifurcating somewhere in the neighbourhood of Venosa, and sending off an arm of the main range through this eastern district, similar to that which traverses Calabria. But this is entirely erroneous; the whole of the district in question is merely a continuation of the low tract of Apulia, consisting of undulating downs and low bare hills of very moderate elevation, with a dry calcareous soil of Tertiary origin. The Monte Voltore, which rises in the neighbourhood of Melfi and Venosa to a height of 4357 feet, v is of volcanic origin, and in great measure detached from the adjoining mass of the Apennines. But eastward from this nothing like a mountain is to be found, the ranges of low bare hills called the Murgie of Gravina and Altamura gradually 7 sinking into the still more moderate level of those which constitute the peninsular tract that extends between Brindisi and Taranto as far as the Cape of Sta Maria di Leuca, the south-east extremity of Italy. It is this projecting tract, which may be termed the “heel” or “spur” of Southern Italy, that, in conjunction with the great promontory of Calabria, forms the deep bay called the Gulf of Taranto, about 70 miles in width, and somewhat greater [9:13:440] depth, which receives a number of streams that descend from the central mass of the Apennines.

The rivers of Southern Italy are none of them of any great importance. The Liris or Garigliano, which has its source in the central Apennines above Sora, not far from the Lake Fucino, and enters the Gulf of Gaeta about 10 miles east of the city of that name, brings down a considerable body of water; as does also the Volturno, which rises in the mountains between Castel di Sangro and Agnone, flows past Isernia, Venafro, and Capua, and enters the sea about 15 miles from the mouth of the Garigliano. About 16 miles above Capua it receives the Calore, which flows by Benevento, and is a tributary of some, importance. The Silarus or Sele, which enters the Gulf of Salerno a few miles below the ruins of Paestum, is the only other river of consideration on the western coast of Southern Italy. Below this the watershed of the Apennines is too near to the sea on that side to allow of the formation of any streams of importance. Hence the rivers that flow in the opposite direction into the Adriatic and the Gulf of Taranto have much longer courses, and are of more considerable volume and magnitude, though all of them partaking of the character of mountain torrents, rushing down with great violence in winter and after storms, but dwindling into scanty streams in the summer, which hold a winding and sluggish course through the great plains of Apulia. Proceeding south from the Trigno, which has been already mentioned as constituting the limit of Central Italy, we find (1) the Biferno and (2) the Fortore, both of them rising in the mountains of Samnium, and flowing into the Adriatic west of Monte Gargano; (3) the Cervaro, south of the great promontory; and (4) th) Ofanto, familiar to all scholars as the Aufidus of Horace, whose description of it is characteristic of almost all the ri∣ ers of southern Italy, of which it may be taken as the typical representative. It rises about 15 miles west of Conza, and only about 25 miles from the Gulf of Salerno, so that it is frequently (though erroneously) described as traversing the whole range of the Apennines. In its lower course it flows near Canosa and traverses the celebrated battlefield of Cannae. (5) The Bradan∩, which rises near Venosa, almost at the foot of Monte Voltore, flows towards the south-east into the Gulf of Taranto, as do the Basento, the Agri, and the Sinno, all of which descend from the central chain of the Apennines south of Potenza, and water the extensive plains between the mountains and the shores of the gulf. The Crati, which flows from Cosenzι northwards, and then turns abruptly eastward to enter the same gulf, is the only stream worthy of notice in the rugged peninsula of Calabria; while the long extent of arid limestone hills projecting eastwards to Capo di Leuca does not give rise to anything more than a mere streamlet, from the mouth of the Ofanto to the south eastern extremity of Italy.

Lakes.— The only important lakes in Italy are those at the foot of the Alps, formed by the expansion of the tributaries of the Po, which, after descending from the mountain valleys in which they are at first confined, spread out into considerable sheets of water before traversing the extensive plain of Northern Italy. They have been already noticed in connexion with the rivers by which they are formed, but may be again enumerated in order of succession. They are, proceeding from west to east, (1) the Lago d’Orta, (2) the Lago Maggiore, (3) the Lago di Lugano, (4) the Lago di Como, (5) the Lago d’Iseo, (6) the Lago d’Idro, and (7) the Lago di Garda. Of these the last named is considerably the largest, covering a superficial area of about 140 English square miles. It is about 38 miles long by 12 broad at its southern extremity; while the Lago Maggiore, notwithstanding its name, though considerably exceeding it in length (42 miles), falls materially below it in superficial extent. They are all of great depth,—the Lago Maggiore having in one part a depth of 2600 feet, while that of Como attains to 1925 feet. Of a wholly different character is the Lago di Varese, between the Lago Maggiore and that of Lugano, which is a mere shallow expanse of water, surrounded by hills of very moderate elevation. Two other small lakes in the same neighbourhood, as well as those of Erba and Pusiano, between Como and Lecco, are of a similar character, and scarcely worthy of notice.

The lakes of Central Italy, which are comparatively of trifling dimensions, belong to a wholly different class. The most important of these, the Lacus Fucinus of the ancients, now called the Lago di Celano, which is situated almost exactly in the centre of the peninsula, occupies (as has been already pointed out) a basin of considerable extent, surrounded on all sides by mountains, and without any natural outlet, at an elevation of more than 2000 feet above the sea. Its waters have of late years been in great part carried off by an artificial channel, and more than half its surface laid bare. Next in size is the Lago Trasimeno, often called the Lago di Perugia, so celebrated in Roman history; it is a broad expanse of shallow waters, surrounded only by low hills, but about 30 miles in circumference. The neighbouring lake of Chiusi is of similar character, but much smaller dimensions. All the other lakes of Central Italy, which are scattered through the volcanic districts west of the Apennines, are of a wholly different formation, and occupy deep cup-shaped hollows, which have undoubtedly at one time formed the craters of extinct volcanoes. Such is the Lago di Bolsena, near the city of the same name, which is an extensive sheet of water, as well as the much smaller Lago di Vico (the Ciminian lake of ancient writers) and the Lago di Bracciano, nearer Rome, while again to the south of Rome the well known lakes of Albano and Nemi have a similar origin.

The only lake properly so called in Southern Italy is the Lago del Matese, in the heart of the mountain group of the same name, of very trifling extent. The so-called lakes on the coast of the Adriatic north and south of the promontory of Gargano are in fact mere brackish lagoons communicating with the sea.

Islands.— The three great islands of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica are so closely connected with Italy, both by geographical position and community of language, that they are frequently spoken of as the Italian Islands, but they will best be considered separately, and we shall here .confine our attention to the smaller islands that lie scattered in the Mediterranean within sight of the coasts of Italy. Of these by much the most considerable is that of Elba, situated on the west coast of Central Italy, about 50 miles south of Leghorn, and separated from the mainland at Piombino by a strait of only about 6 miles in width. North of this, and just about midway between Corsica and Tuscany, is the small island of Capraja, steep and rocky, and only 4J miles long, but with a secure port; Gorgona, about 25 miles farther north, is still smaller, and is a mere rock, inhabited only by a few fishermen. South of Elba are the equally insignificant islets of Pianosa and Monte Cristo, while the more considerable island of Giglio lies much nearer the mainland, immediately opposite the remarkable mountain promontory of Monte Argentaro, itself almost an island. Of a wholly different character are the islands that are found farther south in the Tyrrhenian Sea. Of these Ischia and Procida, both of them situated almost close to the northern headland of the Bay of Naples, are entirely of volcanic origin, as is the case also with the more distant group of the Ponza Islands. These are three in number—Ponza, Palmaruola, and Zannone; while Vandotena (also of volcanic formation) is [9:13:441] about midway between Ponza and Ischia. The island of Capri, on the other hand, which is just opposite to the southern promontory of the Bay of Naples, is a precipitous limestone rock. The Aeolian or Lipari Islands, a remarkable volcanic group, belong rather to Sicily than to Italy, though Stromboli, the most easterly of them, is about equidistant from Sicily and from the mainland. The islands to the south of Sicily—Malta and Gozo, and Pantellaria—in like manner do not fall within the scope of the present article. Malta indeed has very little natural connexion with Sicily, and none with the continent of Italy.

The Italian coast of the Adriatic presents a great contrast to its opposite shores, for while the coast of Dalmatia is bordered by a succession of islands, great and small, the long and uniform coast-line of Italy from Otranto to Rimini presents not a single adjacent island; and the small outlying group of the Tremiti Islands (north of the Monte Gargano and about 15 miles from the mainland) alone breaks the monotony of this part of the Adriatic.

Climate and Natural Productions.

The geographical position of Italy, extending from about 46° to 38° N. lat., naturally renders it one of the hottest countries in Europe. But the effect of its southern latitude is to a great extent tempered by its peninsular character, bounded as it is on both sides by seas of considerable extent, as well as by the great range of the Alps with its snows and glaciers to the north. Great differences also exist with regard to climate between Northern and Southern Italy, due in great part to other circumstances as well as to difference of latitude. Thus the great plain of Northern Italy is chilled by the cold winds from the Alps, while the damp warm winds from the Mediterranean are to a great extent intercepted by the Ligurian Apennines. Hence this part of the country has a cold winter climate, so that the thermometer descends as low as 10° Fahr., and the mean winter temperature of Turin is actually lower than that of Copenhagen. Throughout the region north of the Apennines no plants will thrive which cannot stand occasional severe frosts in winter, so that not only oranges and lemons but even the olive tree cannot be grown, except in specially favoured situations. On the other hand the strip of coast between the Apennines and the sea, known as the Riviera of Genoa, is not only extremely favourable to the growth of olives, but produces oranges and lemons in abundance, while even the aloe, the cactus, and the palm flourish in many places. Indeed, the vegetation of parts of this favoured district has amore southern character than is met with again till below Terracina towards the south. The great plain of Lombardy, however, produces ri.e in large quantities, as well as Indian corn, millet, and wheat; while the mountain slopes both of the Alps and Apennines are covered with vast forests of chestnuts, and the lower hills are clothed with vineyards, which furnish abundance of wines, many of them of excellent quality. Silk is also an important article of produce both in the north of Italy and in Tuscany, and mulberries are largely planted with a view to its production.

Central Italy also presents striking differences of climate and temperature according to the greater or less proximity to the mountains. Thus the greater part of Tuscany, and the provinces from thence to Rome, enjoy a mild winter climate, and are well adapted to the growth of mulberries and olives as well as vines, but it is not till after passing Terracina, in proceeding along the western coast towards the south, that the vegetation of Southern Italy develops itself in its full luxuriance. Even in the central parts of Tuscany, however, the climate is very much affected by the neighbouring mountains, and the increasing elevation of the Apennines as they proceed south naturally produces a corresponding effect upon the temperature. But it is when we reach the central range of the Apennines that we find the coldest districts of Italy. In all the upland valleys of the Abruzzi and of Sannio, snow begins to fall early in November, and heavy storms occur often as late as May; whole communities are shut out for months from any intercourse with their neighbours, and some villages are so long buried in snow that regular passages are made between the different houses for the sake of communication among the-inhabitants. The district extending from the south-east of Lake Fucino to the Piano di Cinquemiglia, and enclosing the upper basin of the Sangro and the small lake of Scanno, is the coldest and most bleak part of Italy south of the Alps. Heavy falls of snow in June are not uncommon,, and it is only for a short time towards the end of July that the nights are totally exempt from light frosts. Yet less than 40 miles east of this district, and even more to the north, we find the olive, the fig-tree, and the orange thriving luxuriantly on the shores of the Adriatic from Ortona to Vasto. In the same way, whilst in the plains and hills round Naples snow is rarely seen, and never remains long, and the thermometer seldom descends to the freezing point, 20 miles east from it in the fertile valley of Avellino, of no great elevation, but encircled by high mountains, light frosts are not uncommon as late as June; and 18 miles farther east, in the elevated region of S. Angelo de’ Lombardi and Bisaccia, the inhabitants are always warmly clad, and vines grow with difficulty and only in sheltered, places. But nowhere are these contrasts so striking as in Calabria. The shores, especially on the Tyrrhenian Sea, present almost a continued grove of olive, orange, lemon, and citron trees, which attain a size unknown in the north of Italy. The sugar-cane flourishes, the cotton-plant ripens to perfection, date-trees are seen in the gardens, the rocks are clothed with the prickly-pear or Indian fig, the enclosures of the fields are formed by aloes and sometimes pomegranates, the liquorice-root grows wild, and the mastic, the myrtle, and many varieties of oleander and cistus form the underwood of the natural forests of arbutus and evergreen oak. If we turn inland but 5 or 6 miles from the shore, and often even less, the scene changes. High districts covered with oaks and chestnuts succeed to this almost tropical vegetation; a little higher up and we reach the elevated regions of the Pollino and the Sila, covered with firs and pines, and affording rich pastures even in the midst of summer, when heavy dews and light frosts succeed each other in July and August, and snow begins to appear at the end of September or early in October. Along the shores of the Adriatic, which are exposed to the north-east winds, blowing coldly from over the Albanian mountains, delicate plants do not thrive so well in general as under the same latitude along the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea.

Southern Italy indeed has in general a very different climate from the northern portion of the kingdom; and, though large tracts are still occupied by rugged mountains of sufficient elevation to retain the snow for a considerable part of the year, the districts adjoining thejsea enjoy a climate similar to that of Greece and the southern provinces of Spain. Unfortunately several of these fertile tracts suffer severely from malaria, and especially the great plain adjoining the Gulf of Tarentum, which in the early ages of history was surrounded by a girdle of Greek cities, —some of which attained to almost unexampled prosperity, —has for centuries past been given up to almost complete desolation.

It is remarkable that, of the vegetable producti ns of Italy, many of those which are at the present day among the first to attract the attention of the visitor, and might be thought characteristic of the country, are of comparatively[9:13:442] late introduction, and were wholly unknown in ancient times. The olive indeed in all ages clothed the hills of a large part of the country; but the orange and lemon, which now constitute so prominent a feature in the warmer districts of the peninsula, are a late importation from the East, while the cactus or Indian fig and the aloe, both of them so conspicuous on the shores of southern Italy, as well as of the Riviera of Genoa, are of Mexican origin, and consequently could not have been introduced earlier than the 16th century. The same remark applies to the maize or Indian corn, which is now so extensively cultivated in every part of Italy. Many botanists are even of opinion that the sweet chestnut, which now constitutes so large a part of the forests that clothe the sides both of the Alps and the Apennines, and in some districts supplies the chief food of the inhabitants, is not originally of Italian growth; it is certain at least that it had not attained in ancient times to anything like the extension and importance which it possesses at the present day.

It may have been gathered from the preceding sketch of the physical conformation and the climate of Italy that it is difficult to take a general view of the state of its agriculture. The cultivation of Lombardy differs from that of Calabria as much as that of Massachusetts does from that of Carolina. All that can be done therefore in this general description is to notice those results of agriculture which yield food, drink, or clothing to its inhabitants, or which form the basis of manufacturing industry or the rudiments of foreign commerce. The cereals form, as elsewhere in Europe, the chief aliment of the inhabitants; in Italy, however, the lower classes in many parts subsist much on maize and beans, which require little preparation to render them fit for food. In some of the southern provinces wheat is made use of by the same class, both in the form of bread and as macaroni, which is manipulated with great facility. Wheat and maize are, on the average of years, about equal to the consumption, but little can be spared for exportation; and in many of the ports •depots of foreign wheat are kept to meet the variations of seasons, or to be used as articles of commerce with other countries.

As Italy produces abundance of wine, and consequently needs neither beer nor grain-spirits, no barley is needed for these drinks, and scarcely any is cultivated. Oats are but little grown, but beans of various kinds are produced in abundance. Rye, the common bread-corn of the far greater portion of Europe, is only raised in a few spots in the very northernmost parts of Italy, where it is made into bread for the poor; whilst those of the higher classes there, as well as throughout the whole peninsula in the cities, make use of wheaten bread. Rice grows in many parts, in fact wherever there is a sufficiency of water to insure a good produce, at such a distance from towns as not to be injurious to the health of the inhabitants. A great variety of lupines are used as food, especially in the soups. In some parts of the mountainous regions chestnuts are a substitute for corn, and even form the principal food of the population. Fruits are plentifully used, particularly figs, grapes, and melons, as food; whilst .the cheapness of onions, garlic, tornatos or love-apples, and capsicums renders them valuable as condiments. The potato, which ,is in such common use in other parts of Europe, has been but partially introduced into Italy; and, where it is cultivated, it occupies a very small proportion of the soil. Lettuces, asparagus, endive, artichokes, and several kinds of turnips and of carrots are grown everywhere.

Animal food is far from being extensively used. The oxen yield in some parts excellent in others very indifferent meat. The mutton is neither good nor abundant, but has been much improved of late years. Swine furnish a plentiful supply during the winter months; they are also prepared as bacon or hams, and above all as sausages, the fame of which has reached England under the name of the city of Bologna, where they were early and extensively prepared. The large dairy farms in Lombardy also furnish great quantities of cheese of very superior quality, especially that known by the name of Parmesan.

The fisheries contribute largely to the supply of food in Italy, though, from the number of fasts countenanced by the Catholic Church, not enough for the consumption; and the deficiency is procured by commerce with the English, French, and Americans, who convey to the seaports salted cod-fish from the banks of Newfoundland. The native fisheries on the coast give much occupation; the most considerable are those for the tunny, a very large fish, and for the anchovy, a very small one. These are conducted upon a large scale by joint-stock companies. The lakes and the rivers also yield some, though not a great proportion, of that kind of food which ecclesiastical restrictions render indispensable.

The sugar-cane is not cultivated in the south of Italy, as it is found that in point of strength, as well as of cost,' the sugar made from it does not succeed in competition with that imported from the West Indies.

The products of agriculture are sufficient for the clothing of all its inhabitants; for, though wool is in general neither good nor plentiful, hemp and flax are grown everywhere, and are manufactured at home; and, from the nature of the climate, linen can be substituted for woollen dress during most of the months of the year. Some cotton is grown in the southern divisions of Italy, but not sufficient to furnish materials for their inconsiderable manufactures of that article.

The chief product of Italian agriculture is silk. It is produced in every part, and much of is it converted into articles of dress or of furniture, where it is collected; but the chief production of it is in the Neapolitan provinces and Lombardy, whence the looms of England, Austria, Russia, and Germany are supplied. The value of this commodity exceeds that of all the other productions of Italy which are exported to foreign countries. The manufacture has of late years made great progress, which it is still steadily maintaining, and the great increase which has taken place in the propagation of the mulberry tree has, within the last fifty years, increased the quantity of raw silk to an extent that had never before been dreamed of.

Another very important Italian product, which is partly used as food, partly employed in home manufactures, and extensively exported as an article of foreign commerce, is the oil of the olive tree. It is used as a substitute for butter in the south, and even to a great degree supplies the place of milk, which is comparatively little used in the peninsula. It is exported to England for use with various fabrics, and as a table luxury. The planting and watching costs but little labour or expense, and in a few years the income more than repays the labour. The best olive oil is produced near Genoa, in Lucca, in Tuscany, and in Calabria; but it is plentiful throughout the whole of Italy, except,in Lombardy and in Piedmont.

The -wines of Italy are not very highly valued in other countries, and almost the whole that is produced is consumed at home. Vet there is little doubt that with more care in the culture and preparation they might rival those of the best parts of Europe. The vines are not so much grown in vineyards as in the hedge-rows,—a system which doubtless injures the quality of the wine. In the southern parts, however, where the vines are grown in low vineyards as in Fχance, the wines are of higher quality.

The mineral productions of Italy are of comparatively small value; but the copper mines of Tuscany, which were [9:13:443] extensively wrought in ancient times, are still worked to a considerable extent. The iron of Elba, so celebrated in antiquity, still bears a high character for its excellent quality, but the quantity produced is limited. Many marbles of superior quality are found in different parts of the Apennines, of which the white statuary marble of Carrara is the most celebrated. Alabaster also abounds in Tuscany. Coal is wanting in all parts of the peninsula, which must ever be a great drawback to the prosperity of Italy.

The geology of Italy is mainly dependent upon that of the Apennines ljpvf. On each side of that great chain, which, as has been already stated, with its ramifications and underfalls, fills up the greater part of the peninsula, are found extensive Tertiary deposits, sometimes, as in Tuscany, the Monferrat, <fec., forming a broken, hilly country, at others spreading into broad plains or undulating downs, such as the Tavoliere of Puglia, and the tract that forms the spur of Italy from Bari to Otranto.

But besides these, and leaving out of account the islands, the Italian peninsula presents four distinct volcanic .districts. In three of them the volcanoes are entirely extinct, while the fourth is still in great activity.

(1) The Euganean hills form a small group extending for about 10 miles from the neighbourhood of Padua to Este, and separated from the lower offshoots of the Alps by a portion of the wide plain of the Padovano. Monte Venda, their highest peak, is 1806 feet high.

(2) The Roman district, the largest of the four, extends from the hills of Albano to the frontier of Tuscany, and from the lower slopes of the Apennines to the Tyrrhenian Sea. It may be divided into three groups :—the Monti Albani, the highest of which, Monte Cavo, 3160 feet, is the ancient Mons Albanus, on the summit of which stood the temple of Jupiter Latialis, where the assemblies of the cities forming the Latin confederation were held; the Monti Cimini, which extend from the valley of the Tiber to the neighbourhood of Civita Vecchia, and attain at their culminating point an elevation of more than 3000 feet; and the mountains of Radicofani and Monte Λmiata, the latter of which is 5650 feet high. The lakes of Bolsena (Vulsiniensis), of Bracciano (Sabatinus), of Vico (Ciminus), of Albano (Albanus), of Nemi (Nemorensis), and other smaller ones belong to this district; while between its -south-west extremity and Monte Circello the Pontine Marshes form a broad strip of alluvial soil infested by malaria.

(3) The volcanic region of Terra di Lavoro is separated by the Volscian mountains from the Roman district. It may be also divided into three groups. Of Roccamonfina, at the north-north-west end of the Campanian Plain, the highest cone, called Montagna di Santa Croce, is 3200 feet. The Phlegraean Fields embrace all the country round Baiae and Pozuoli and the adjoining islands. Monte Barbaro (Gaurus), north-east of the site of Cumae, Monte S. Nicola (Epomeus), 2610 feet, in Ischia, and Camaldoli, 1488 feet, west of Naples, are the highest cones. The lakes Averno (Avernus), Lucrino (Lucrinus), Fusaro (Palus Acherusia), and Agnano are within this group, which has shown activity in historical times. A stream of lava issued in 1198 from the crater of the Solfatara, which still continues to exhale steam and noxious gases; the Lava dell’ Arso came out of the north-east flank of Monte Epomeo in 1302; and Monte Nuovo, north-west of Pozzuoli, 440 feet high, was thrown up in three days in September 1538. Since its first historical eruption in 79 a.d., Vesuvius or Somma, •which forms the third group, has been in constant activity, and repeated eruptions have taken place within the last few years. The Punta del Nasone, the highest point of iSomma, is 3747 feet high, while the Punta del Palo, the highest point of the brim of the crater of Vesuvius, varies materially with successive eruptions from 3856 to 4235 feet.

(4) The Apulian volcanic formation consists of the great mass of Monte Voltore, which rises at the west end of the plains of Apulia, on the frontier of Basilicata, and is surrounded by the Apennines on its south-west and north-west sides. Its highest peak, the Pizzuto di Melfi, attains an elevation of 4357 feet. Within the widest crater there are the two small lakes of Monticchio and S. Michele.

In connexion with the volcanic districts we may mention Le Hofete, the Pools of Amsanctus (Amsancti Vallis), lying in a wooded valley south-east of Frigento, in the centre of Principato Ultra and described by Virgil (Aeneid, vii. 563 -71). The largest of the two is not more than 160 feet in circumference, and 7 feet deep. These pools emit noxious gases which, when wafted from the pools by the wind, endanger animal life in the open air.

Ethnography and Ancient Geography.

The ethnography of ancient Italy is a very complicated and difficult subject, and notwithstanding the researches of modern scholars is still involved in much obscurity. The great beauty and fertility of the country, as well as the charm of its climate, undoubtedly attracted from the earliest ages successive swarms of invaders from the north, who sometimes drove out the previous occupants of the most favoured districts, at others reduced them to a state of serfdom, or settled down in the midst of them, until the two races gradually coalesced into one. Ancient writers all agreed in regard to the fact of the composite character of the population of Italy, and the diversity of races that were found within the limits of the peninsula. But unfortunately the traditions they have transmitted to us are very various and conflicting, and probably in many instances founded on inadequate information, while the only safe test of the affinities of nations, derived from the comparison of their languages, is to a great extent deficient, from the fact that, with the single exception of Latin, all the idioms that prevailed in Italy in the earliest ages have disappeared, or are preserved only in a few scanty and fragmentary inscriptions. Imperfect as are the means thus afforded to the philological student, they have been of late years diligently turned to account, especially by German scholars, and, when combined with the notices derived from ancient writers, may be considered as having furnished some results that maybe relied on with reasonable certainty.

Leaving aside for the present the populations of Northern Italy, which belong to a wholly different stock, the inhabitants of the peninsula may be regarded as belonging to three principal divisions. Of these the Messapians or Iapygians in the south may be considered as constituting one; while the different nations of Central Italy, the Umbrians, Oscans, Sabines, and Latins, may also be classed as belonging to one great family; and on the other hand the Etruscans in the west undoubtedly formed a nation apart, distinct from all others within the confines of Italy.

1. The Iαpygians and Oenotrians. — It is certain that when the first Greek colonies in the 8th and 9th centuries B.c. established themselves in the extreme south of Italy, they found the country in the possession of a people to whom they gave the name of Oenotrians,—a name which appears to have been somewhat vaguely applied by different writers so as to include a wider area or be restricted within narrower limits. But the peninsula which strctcbes eastward towards Greece was inhabited by a people termed by the Greeks Messapians or Iapygians, whose relations to the Oenotrians are not very clearly intimated. It is unfortunately in this part of the country almost exclusively that [9:13:444] the extant remains of the language have been found, and these consist of inscriptions of so brief and fragmentary a character as to afford a very imperfect basis for philological inferences. Such as they are, however, they seem to lead to the conclusion that the language spoken in this part of Italy was essentially distinct from the Oscan and Sabellian dialects of Central Italy; while at the same time they present sufficient analogies with the Latin on the one hand and the Greek on the other to show that they belonged to the same family with those two well-known languages. The results, therefore, of the recent examination of these long neglected documents appear distinctly to confirm the statements of ancient authors, according to which the inhabitants of the southern portion of the peninsula were a Pelasgic race,—a term used by them in a very vague and general manner, but usually employed to designate the most ancient inhabitants both of Greece and Italy, who probably belonged to the same branch of the great Aryan race. The Pelasgic origin of the Oenotrians is not only asserted by the concurrent testimony of many ancient authors, but we are told that the native population of Southern Italy, who had been reduced to a state of serfdom analogous to that of the Penestae in Thessaly and the Helots in Laconia were still called Pelasgi. The evidence as to the Pelasgic origin of the Messapians or Iapygians is less definite; but the mythical genealogies in which the earliest Greek authors embodied the received traditions concerning the relations of different tribes and nations all point to the same conclusion; and they certainly regarded the neighbouring tribes of the Peucetians and Daunians, who occupied a part of the country subsequently known as Apulia, as derived from the same stock. A strong confirmation of this view is found in the facility with which the inhabitants of these countries assimilated Greek customs and manners, though the actual Greek colonies founded among them in historical times were comparatively few.

It must be observed that the name of Italians was at one time confined to the Oenotrians; indeed, according to Antiochus of Syracuse, the name of Italy was at first still more limited, being applied only to the southern portion of the peninsula now known as Calabria. But in the time of that historian, as well as of Thucydides, the names of Oenotria and Italia, which appear to have been at that period regarded as synonymous, had come to be extended so as to include the shore of the Tarentine Gulf as far as Metapontum and from thence across to the Gulfs of Laus and Posidonia on the Tyrrhenian Sea. It thus still comprised only the two provinces subsequently known as Lucania and Bruttium.

2. The tribes of Central Italy, from the Umbrians in the north to the Campanians in the south, are known by existing remains of their languages to have spoken cognate dialects, presenting unquestionable affinities with each other, as well as with the earlier forms of the well-known language of the Latins. The differences, however, are still very considerable, and confirm the testimony of historical tradition, as preserved to us by ancient writers, in leading us to divide them into five separate groups, viz., the Umbrians, Sabines, Latins, Volscians, and Oscans, or as they are sometimes termed Sabellians, including the Samnites and Campanians, and the tribes (such as the Lucanians, Frentani, &c.) who are distinctly recorded to have emanated from the Samnites.

(1) The Umbrians, who occupied in historical times the eastern portion of the peninsula between Etruria and the Adriatic, were at an earlier period a much more powerful nation, and not only occupied the extensive tract subsequently wrested from them by the Gauls, but extended their dominion from sea to sea, and held the greater part, if not the whole, of the territory afterwards possessed by the Etruscans, which is said to have been wrested by that people foot by foot from the Umbrians. The concurrent voice of the traditions preserved to us from antiquity points to the Umbrians as one of the most ancient nations of Italy; and this is confirmed by the still extant remains of their language as shown in the celebrated inscriptions known as the Eugubine Tables {q.v.), by far the most important monument of any of the early Italian languages that has been transmitted to our time. The elaborate examination of this valuable record in recent times may be considered as establishing clearly, on the one hand, the distinctness of the language from that of the neighbouring Etruscans, and, on the other, its close affinity with the Oscan, as spoken by the Sabellian tribes, and with the old Latin. The same researches tend to prove that the Umbrian dialect is the most ancient of these cognate tongues, and probably represents most nearly the original form of this branch of the great Indo-Teutonic family. They may be taken also as distinctly negativing the theory put forth by some ancient writers, and maintained by several modern inquirers, that the Umbrians were a Celtic race.

Before the time when the Umbrians came into contact with the advancing power of Rome, their importance had greatly declined. The Etruscans had conquered from them the whole territory west of the Apennines, from the foot of the mountains to the Tyrrhenian Sea, while the Senonian Gauls, who invaded the north of Italy in the 4th century B.c., permanently established themselves in possession of the fertile district between the Apennines and the Adriatic, extending from the neighbourhood of Ravenna to that of Ancona, which continued to be known until long afterwar ds as the “Ager Gallicus.”

(2) The Sabines are a people of whom, familiar as is their name to the student of Roman history, we know very little. Their language is totally lost; not a single inscription has been preserved to us, and it appears to have fallen into disuse at a comparatively early period. But even from the few scattered notices of Sabine words preserved by Roman grammarians it is evident that it possessed strong affinities with the Oscan and Umbrian; and the facility with which it passed into those of the neighbouring races is a strong reason against there being any marked diversity between them. The traditions recorded by ancient writers, untrustworthy as they are in detail, all concur in pointing to the same result,—that the Sabines were a very ancient people, who, at the earliest period of which any memory was preserved, were settled in the lofty mountain districts about the sources of the A ternus and the Velinus, from which they subsequently descended into the more fertile valleys about Reate, and at one time extended their dominion to within a few miles of Rome,—Cures, which was universally reckoned a Sabine city, being only 24 miles from the capital, while Nomentum and Eretum, still nearer Rome, are included by several writers as Sabine towns.

That a people inhabiting so rugged and inclement a district as that which is represented as the original abode of the Sabines should have spread themselves into the neighbouring regions, and established offshoots in somewhat more favoured lands, is entirely in accordance with probability, and hence we can have no difficulty in accepting the tradition that the Picentes, or inhabitants of Picenum,—the fertile district along the coast of the Adriatic between that sea and the main ridge of the Apennines, from beyond Ancona to the river Matrino,—were of Sabine origin. The same thing is expressly asserted by Ovid (himself a native of the district) of the Peligni, a tribe who occupied the upland valley of the Gizio, of which Sulmo was the capital; and there can be little doubt that the [9:13:445] sime remark applied to three other tribes which were contiguous to them, and always appear in the Roman history in close political union with them :—the Marsi, who held the basin of the Lake Fucino and the surrounding mountains, and the Vestini and Marrucini, who extended from the confines of the Marsi and Peligni down to the Adriatic, each people occupying but a narrow strip on the north and south sides respectively of the Aternus.

(3) The Latins, who were destined in the end to become the rulers of all Italy, were in the first instance a comparatively insignificant people, surrounded on all sides by more powerful nations. When we first become acquainted with their history they occupied only the tract extending from the Tiber on the north to the Volscian mountains and the Pontine Marshes on the south, and from the sea to the underfalls of the Apennines about Tibur (Tivoli) and Praeneste (Palestrina). It was not till a much later period that the name of Latium was extended so as to include the land of the Volscians and the Aurunci to the borders of Campania.

The ethnical relations of the Latins have been peculiarly confused by the conflicting statements of ancient authors, who endeavoured to connect them on the one hand with the vast floating mass of Greek traditions, and on the other to add dignity to their origin by tracing them back to indigenous heroes or deities. Of their real origin as a people, or of the period when they first settled in the fertile district where we find them established at the dawn of historical record, we have no trustworthy information. But from the manifold traditions preserved to us by Dionysius and other authors we may perhaps gather two facts. The statement that the Latins were derived (in part at least) from a people who dwelt originally in the lofty mountains of the central Apennines, from whence they descended into the comparatively fertile region between the mountains and the sea, probably represents in a general way correctly the course of their immigration; while the idea involved in several of these traditions, that the population of ancient Latium was in part derived from a Pelasgic origin, is confirmed by philological investigation of the Latin language, which may be considered as establishing the conclusion that it contained a considerable Pelasgic or old Greek element, together with another portion which was common to the languages of the adjacent nations of Central Italy, the Umbrians, Oscans, <tc., whom we are now considering. The co existence of these two diverse elements in Latin was long ago pointed out by Niebuhr, who attributed it to the conquest of one race by another at a period anterior to all historical record. It may perhaps be more safely ascribed to the branching off of the Latin race from the parent stock at an earlier period than the other languages of Central Italy, while the differences that separated them from those of the early inhabitants of Greece were less marked than they afterwards became.

(4) The Volscians, who ultimately became merged in the more progressive Latin race, are undoubtedly represented to us in the early Roman history as a distinct people, not only politically separate from the Latin league, but having a distinct language of their own, which was neither Latin nor Oscan. The very scanty remains of it that have been preserved to us by inscriptions, while they confirm this statement, show at the same time remarkable analogies with the Umbrian, and thus tend to prove that the Volscians had occupied from a very early period the rugged mountain district where we find them established in historical times, and had retained their dialect with less change than their Sabellian and Oscan neighbours.

Of the Aequians, who held a mountainous district adjoining that of the Volscians, we cannot be said to know anything beyond the fact that the two nations appear constantly in Roman history in alliance against the rising republic, from which, however, we are hardly entitled to argue their common descent. But it is certain that both the Aequians and the petty tribe of the Hernicans are in early ages uniformly represented as distinct from the Latins, though their territory was included in Latium, in the more extended sense of the term, while the native population had in the days of Livy almost wholly disappeared.

(5) The Oscans, or as the Greeks wrote the name Opicans (the native form was Op scans), were the possessors of the greater part of Central Italy, as well as the southern part of the peninsula, at the time that the Romans were carrying on their long protracted struggle for its dominion. At the same time it must be observed that it was never used in ancient times as a proper ethnic appellation. No tribe or nation of the name appears among those with which Rome was engaged in hostilities; and, though the term Oscan is frequently used by ancient writers as applied to the language of Campania, there is no proof that it was ever employed by them in the more general sense adopted by modern scholars. It is, however, as a matter of convenience, a useful term to designate the nation or group of tribes composed of the Samnites, together with their descendants or offshoots, the Campanians, Lucanians, and Bruttians. The name Sabellians, used by the Roman poets, has been employed by some modern writers in much the same signification.

Of the nations comprised under this general appellation, much the most powerful were the Samnites, who occupied, not merely the small mountain district known in modern days as Sannio, but the whole region of the central Apennines from the upper valley of the Sagrus (Sangro) on the north to that of the Aufidus on the south, while towards the west they held the valleys of the Vulturous and its various tributaries down to the point where they emerged into the fertile plain of Campania. The territory thus defined was, like that of the Sabines, a wholly inland district, but the Samnites were not long content with these narrow limits, and at an early period we find them carrying their arms and extending their settlements to the sea on both sides. The Frentani, who separated them from the Adriatic to the north, are distinctly termed by Strabo a Samnite people, and distinguished by him as such from the adjoining tribes of the Vestini and Marrucini. A more important extension was that towards the west, where they conquered the whole of the rich province of Campania, with the exception of the districts on the coast still retained by the Greek colonies. This conquest appears to have taken place as late at the 5th century b,c., but the same causes continued in operation, and during the course of the next half century the Samnites spread themselves through the whole of Lucania, and even carried their arms to the extremity of the southern peninsula. The Lucanians therefore, when they first became known to the Romans, were a Samnite people, though possessing a separate political organization. They at this time ruled over the whole country called by the Greeks Oenotria, down to the Sicilian Strait, and had reduced the previous inhabitants to a state of serfdom. Hence not long afterwards there arose in the southernmost part of the peninsula (the modern Calabria) an insurrection, represented as a mere casual outbreak of outlaws and fugitive slaves, but probably in reality a revolt of the native population who, under the name of Bruttians, established their independence, and retained possession of the whole of this wild and mountainous country, till they passed, together with the Lucanians, under the all-absorbing dominion of Rome.

It is more difficult to. determine to what extent the Apulians had received an admixture of the Samnite [9:13:446] element, but there seems no doubt that the northern part of the province known to the Romans under that name had been occupied by a Samnite population, while the tribes south of Mount Garganus—the Daunians and Peucetians—probably retained their nationality, though brought under subjection by the Samnites.

The monuments of the Oscan language, though not numerous, are more considerable than those of any other of the early Italian languages, except the Umbrian, and can for the most part be interpreted with reasonable certainty by the assistance of Latin. The most important of them are—(1) The Tabula Bantina, a bronze tablet found in the neighbourhood of Bantia (Banzi), on the borders of Apulia and Lucania, which relates to the municipal affairs of that town; (2) the Cippus Abellanus, so called from its having been found near Abella in Campania, containing a treaty or agreement between the two neighbouring cities of Nola and Abella; and (3) a bronze tablet more recently discovered in the neighbourhood of Agnone in northern Samnium, recording the dedication of various sacred offerings. It is interesting to observe that these three specimens of the ancient dialect have been found in nearly the most distant quarters of the Oscan territory. None have as yet been found in Lucania or Bruttium, but we know from Festus that the Bruttians spoke Oscan. The language was thus at one time spoken through the whole of the southern peninsula. It doubtless ceased to be employed officially after the defeat of the Samnites and their allies in the Social War (90-88 b.c.) ; but the numerous minor inscriptions found rudely scratched or painted on the walls of Pompeii show that it continued in vernacular use until a much later period.

3. The Etruscans. — The obscure question of the origin and affinities of this remarkable people, and the attempts that have been made to interpret their language, have been fully discussed in the article Etruria. For the present we must be content to acquiesce in the conclusion, which is in accordance with all the statements of ancient authors, that they were a people wholly distinct from all others in Italy, while the researches of modern writers have been able to throw but very little light upon their language or ethnical affinities.

Northern Italy.— The ethnography of Northern Italy is much more simple than that of the central regions of the peninsula. At the time when the Romans first became acquainted with this part of Italy, the whole country was divided among three nations—the Gauls, the Ligurians, and the Veneti or Venetians.

(1) Of these the Gauls, who occupied the extensive plains in the valley of the Po and its tributaries, and had extended their dominion from the Alps to the Apennines and the Adriatic, were unquestionably intruders or immigrants, who had crossed the Alps at a comparatively late period. The last emigration was that in which the Senones or Senonian Gauls established themselves, as has been already mentioned, in the coast land of Umbria between the Apennines and the Adriatic; and this invasion was, according to the Roman historians, directly connected with the capture of Rome in 390 B.c. But the migration of the great mass of the Gauls who occupied-the plains of Northern Italy undoubtedly took place at a much earlier period, and is assigned by Livy, our only authority on the subject, and who unfortunately does not mention the sources from which he derived his information, to the reign of the elder Tarquin at Rome (616-578 b.c.). Who were the people that inhabited this country previous to their irruption we do not know with certainty, but the districts adjoining the foot of the Alps on the west were undoubtedly in the hands of Ligurian tribes, and those in the south at the foot of the Apennines had probably been at one time occupied by the Umbrians, who had, however, previous to the Gaulish invasion been either driven out or reduced tσ∙ subjection by the Etruscans. Of the character and extent of the Etruscan settlements in the region north of the Apennines we have very little information ∙, but the statements of ancient authors that they had at one time extended their dominion over a considerable part of Northern Italy, and founded large cities—among which Felsina (afterwards called Bononia) and Mantua are especially mentioned— have been confirmed of late years by the discovery of undoubted Etruscan remains at Bologna and other places north of the Apennines (see Etruria). But it may well be doubted whether they ever formed the population of these countries; it appears more probable that they were merely a race of more civilized settlers in the midst of the native tribes.

Of the Gaulish tribes whose names are known to us as established in the north of Italy at the time when they first came into collision with the Roman arms, the most important were the Insubres and Cenomani to the north of the Po, and the Boii and Lingones to the south of that river. Immediately west of the Ticinus, the Laevi are expressly called by Livy a Ligurian tribe, while beyond the Adige to the east began the Veneti and Euganei, so that the territory thus occupied by the Gauls was far from comprising the whole tract subsequently known as Gallia Cisalpina.

(2) The Ligurians or Ligures — the Greek form of the name is Ligyes—are a people of whose origin and affinities we know absolutely nothing, but whom we find from the earliest times in possession of the rugged mountainous tract with which their name is inseparably connected. They were, when we first hear of them, considerably more extensively spread than at a later period,—the south coast of Gaul, subsequently included in the Roman province of that name, having been originally occupied by Ligurian tribes. Thus the Sallyes or Salluvii, in whose territory the Greek colony of Massilia was founded (about 600 b.c.), are distinctly described as a Ligurian tribe, and it may be considered certain that they held the whole country from the Maritime Alps to the Rhone, while Scylax represents them as intermixed with Iberian tribes in the tract from the mouths of the Rhone to the foot of the Pyrenees. But all authorities agree that they were a separate nationality, distinct alike from the Iberians and from the Gauls. No trace of their language has been preserved and all theories as to their origin must be purely conjectural.

At the time when they first came in contact with the Roman arms, the Ligurians not only occupied the coast of the Mediterranean and underfalls of the Maritime Alps and Apennines from the Var to the Magra, but the much more extensive tract comprising the northern slopes of those mountains towards the valley of the Po. As has been already mentioned, it is probable that they were still more extensively spread in this direction prior to the irruption of the Gauls, but even in the historical period we find it distinctly stated that the Laevi and Libici, tribes immediately west of the Ticinus, were of Ligurian race. The same thing is told us both by Strabo and Pliny of the Taurini, and was probably true also of their neighbours the Salassi. But the tribes who appear in history as the indomitable foes of Rome, against whom they waged for nearly a century and a half (237-109 b.c.) a war much resembling that of the Circassians against Russia in modern times, were those on the two flanks of the Apennines, and the southern slopes of the Maritime Alps. Here the Ingauni and Intemelii in the western Riviera, and the Statielli on the reverse of the mountains were the most conspicuous tribes; while towards the east the Apuani, who held the Lunigiana and the rugged mountain group above Carrara, [9:13:447] and the Friniates, who extended along the crest of the Apennines from thence to the neighbourhood of Florence, were the subjects of repeated triumphs, and gave the Romans more real trouble than their more brilliant conquests in Macedonia and Asia.

(3) The Veneti or Venetians, who held the north-eastern portion of the great plain of Northern Italy, from the Adige to the Alps of theFrioul, were, according to the concurrent statements of ancient authors, a distinct people from their neighbours the Gauls. Attempts were made by some Greek writers to connect them with the Eneti or Heneti, mentioned by Homer, as a people of Paphlagonia, and several modern authors have sought to identify them with the Venedae or Wends on the shores of the Baltic. But all such theories, based as they are solely on resemblances of name, are of little value. On the other hand it is distinctly stated by Herodotus that they were an Illyrian tribe; and, though this may very likely be a mere inference from their juxtaposition, it is not improbable in itself that they were of the same race with their neighbours the Istrians and Liburnians.

But, besides the Veneti properly so called, two other tribes were found in historical times within the limits of the province as constitute! by Augustus. (1) The Ewja-ηeans, though they had at this period dwindled into an insignificant tribe, had at one time been a powerful people, and according to the statement of Livy (himself a native of this country) had originally occupied the whole tract between the Alps and the sea, from which they had been expelled by the Veneti. And this tradition is confirmed by the fact that remnants of them still lingered in the Italian valleys of the Alps as late as the time of Pliny, and that their name remained inseparably attached, both in ancient and modern times, to the little group of volcanic hills between Padua and Verona, which are still known as the Euganean hills. (2) The Carni, who occupied the northern part of the Frioul, at the foot of the Alps, together with the adjoining mountains, appear to have been certainly a tribe of Celtic or Gaulish origin, and distinct from the Venetians, though included in the province of that name.

Consolidation of Italy.— We have seen that the name of Italy was originally applied only to the southernmost part of the peninsula, and was only gradually extended so as to comprise the central regions, such as Latium and Campania, which were designated by writers as late as Thucydides and Aristotle as in Opicia. The progress of this change cannot be followed in detail, but there can be little doubt that the extension of the Roman arms, and the gradual union of the nations of the peninsula under one dominant power, would contribute to the introduction, or rather would make the necessity felt, for the use of one general appellation. At first indeed the term was apparently confined to the regions of the central and southern districts, exclusive of Cisalpine Gaul and the whole tract north of the Apennines, and this continued to be the official or definite signification of the name down to the end of the republic. But the natural limits of Italy are so clearly marked that the name came to be generally employed as a geographical term at a much earlier period. Thus we already find Polybius repeatedly applying it in this wider signification to the whole country, as far as the foot of the Alps; and it is evident from many passages in the Latin writers that this was the familiar use of the term in the days of Cicero and Caesar. The official distinction was, however, still retained. Cisalpine Gaul, including the whole of Northern Italy, still constituted a “province,” an appellation never applied to Italy itself. As such it was assigned to Julius Caesar, together with Transalpine Gaul, and it was not till he crossed the Rubicon that he entered Italy in the strict sense of the term.

Augustus was the first who gave a definite administrative organization to Italy as a whole, and at the same time gave official sanction to that wider acceptation of the name, which had already established itself in familiar usage, and which has continued to prevail ever since.

The division of Italy into eleven regions (Plate V.), instituted by Augustus for administrative purposes, which continued in official use till the reign of Constantine, was based mainly on the territorial divisions previously existing, and preserved with few exceptions the ancient limits.

The first region comprised Latium (in the more extended sense of the term, as including the land of the Volscians, Hernicans, and Auruncans), together with Campania and the district of the Picentini. It thus extended from the mouth of the Tiber to that of the Silarus.

The second region included Apulia and Calabria (the name by which the Romans usually designated the district known to the Greeks as Messapia or Iapygia), together with the land of the Hirpini, which had usually been considered as a part of Samnium.

The third region contained Lucania and Bruttium; it was bounded on the west coast by the Silarus, on the east by the Bradanus.

The fourth region comprised all the Samnites (except the Hirpini), together with the Sabines and the cognate tribes of the Frentani, Marrucini, Marsi, Peligni, Vestini, and Aequiculi. It was separated from Apulia on the south by the river Tifernus, and from Picenum on the north by the Matrinus.

The fifth region was composed solely of Picenum, extending along the coast of the Adriatic from the mouth of the Matrinus to that of the Aesis, beyond Ancona.

The sixth region was formed by Umbria, in the more extended sense of the term, as including the Ager Gallicus, along the coast of the Adriatic from the Aesis to the Ariminus, and separated from Etruria on the west by the Tiber.

The seventh region consisted of Etruria, which preserved its ancient limits, extending from the Tiber to the Tyrrhenian Sea, and separated from Liguria on the north by the river Macra.

The eighth region, termed Gallia Cispadana, comprised the southern portion of Cisalpine Gaul, and was bounded on the north (as its name implied) by the river Padus or Po, from above Placentia to its mouth. It was separated from Etruria and L τ mbria by the main chain of the Apennines; and the river Ariminus was substituted for the far-famed Rubicon as its limit on the Adriatic.

The ninth region comprised Liguria, extending along the sea-coast from the Varus to the Macra, and inland as far as the river Padus, which constituted its northern boundary from its source in Mount Vesulus to its confluence with the Trebia just above Placentia.

The tenth region included Venetia from the Padus and Adriatic to the Alps, to which was annexed the neighbouring peninsula of Istria, and to the west the territory of the Cenomani, a Gaulish tribe, extending from the Athesis to the Addua, which had previously been regarded as a part of Gallia Cisalpina.

The eleventh region, known as Gallia Transpadana, included all the rest of Cisalpine Gaul from the Padus on the south and the Addua on the east to the foot of the Alps.

The arrangementsthus established by Augustus continued almost unchanged till the time of Constantine, and formed the basis of all subsequent administrative divisions until the fall of the Western empire. It is not worth while to follow in detail the changes introduced during the 4th century. It was the invasion of the Lombards that first broke up the general system of the Roman administration, and prepared the way for the redistribution of Italy in the Middle Ages on a wholly different basis. (e. h. b.) [9:13:448] Statistics.

The preceding sections have dealt with Italy the country as a permanent physical unity; here it is proposed to consider Italy the kingdom as a modern political and social unity. In dealing with the various aspects of the subject we shall be continually reminded of the fact that Italy is one of the very youngest of the greater nations of Europe. In attempting to trace back the movement of any department of social activity, the investigator here finds his retrospect soon interrupted and closed; instead of the statistics of the kingdom of Italy he has only the statistics, fragmentary and incapable of comparison, of the several states by whose incorporation it has been formed.

Extent.— Of the Italian frontier 294 miles coincide with that of France, 355 with that of Switzerland, and 269 with that of Austria. Owing mainly to natural causes, but partly also to political traditions, the line is a very irregular one; and at various points it has been subjected to rectifications on a small scale since the consolidation of the kingdom. The limits towards France are determined by the convention signed at Turin in 1861. The same year saw the revision of the line between Lombardy and Ticino on the basis of the treaty of Varese, 1752. In 1863 the boundary of the Grisons was slightly modified, and the Lei valley assigned to Italy; in 1873 the frontier was fixed between Teramo and Brusio and at the Alp de Cravairola; and in 1875 a district of 4324 acres, or nearly 7 square miles, which had been in dispute was assigned to Italy by the arbitration of the United States, and incorporated with the province of Novara. Ou the surrender of the Austrian provinces of Italy to the new kingdom in 1867, it was decided that the frontier between the two states should be that of the actual administration of the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom.

The total area of the kingdom of Italy is given officially as 296,322 - 91 square kilometres or 114,380 , 64 square miles; but the estimate confessedly rests on data that are to a considerable extent provisional. It was published by Maestri, the head of the general direction of statistics in the census returns for 1861, and the investigations of the minister of public works in 1871 tended to confirm its general accuracy. But that it should be more than a very fair approximation to the truth is impossible in the defective state of the Italian surveys. Though various parts of the country were carefully gone over for cadastral purposes by commissions appointed by several of the independent states of the peninsula,^[1. In the ancient Piedmont provinces a cadastral survey was undertaken as early as 1677, but it was not finished till 1729; in the Modenese provinces that of Garfagnana goes back to 1533, that of Rola to 1785, that of the “plain and hill” to 1791; in the Tuscan provinces the cadastre was compiled between 1822 and 1834; and the Lombardo-Venetian provinces have a double cadastre, the first dating from 1718, the second commenced in 1828. See Atti del primo congresso degli ingegneri ed archiletti ilaliani, Milan, 1875, pp. 420-468. A large map of Italy, in 227 sections, corresponding to that of the English Ordnance Survey, is in course of publication, under the supervision of the lstituto topografico militare (formerly of the Stato maggiore); and a Government commission, which has issued a Bollettino geologico since 1870, is engaged in the preparation of a large geological map. See Giordano in Atti dei Lincei, 1878.] the methods employed in the different cases were so heterogeneous that the results, even if complete, could not readily and correctly be combined into a whole. Many of the communes are destitute of any authentic demarcation of their territorial limits.

Territorial Divisions.— The kingdom is divided into the following sixteen compartimenti (Table I.) :—

1. Piedmont : Alessandria, Cuneo, Novara, Turin.

2. Liguria : Genoa, Porto Maurizio.

3. Lombardy : Bergamo, Brescia, Como, Cremona, Mantua, Milan, Pavia,

Sondrio.

4. Venice: Belluno, Padua, Rovigo, Treviso, Udine, Venice, Verona, Vicenza.

5. Emilia·. Bologna, Ferrara, Forh, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Ravenna,

Reggio.

6. Umbria·. Perugia.

7. Marches : Ancona, Ascoli Piceno, Macerata, Pesaro-Urbino.

8. Tuscany. Arezzo, Florence, Grosseto, Leghorn, Lucca, Massa-Carrara,

Pisa, Siena.

9. Latium : Rome.

10. Abruzzi and Molise·. Aquila, Campobasso, Chieti, Teramo.

11. Campania·. Avellino, Benevento, Caserta, Naples, Salerno.

12. Apulia : Bari, Foggia, Lecce.

13. Basilicata ; Potenza.

14. Calabrias : Catanzaro, Cosenza, Reggio.

15. Sicily. Caltanisetta, Catania, Girgenti, Messina, Palermo, Syracuse,

Trapani.

16. Sardinia : Cagliari, Sassari.

Of these Abruzzi and Molise, Campania, Apulia, Basilicata, and the Calabrias are not unfrequently grouped together in statistical tables under the name of the Neapolitan territory (Napoletano). The provinces which formed the Sardinian kingdom are often spoken of as the Ancient Provinces.

These compartimenti, however, are not true administrative divisions, but rather conventional groupings of a number of provinces. It is the province which forms the true administrative unit. According to modern nomenclature it always takes its name from the capoluogo (chef-lieu or administrative centre), which is the seat of the prefect. The provinces are subdivided into so many circles or districts (the name circondario being employedin all parts of the kingdom except the Veneto, where the old established word distrctto is still in use). The division known as the mandamento has to do with the legal administration only. It must be noted that formerly many of the provinces had special designations other than those of their chief towns, and that some of these are still of not infrequent occurrence especially outside of Italy. Thus Reggio corresponds to Calabria Ulteriore Prima, Catanzaro to Calabria Ulteriore Seconda, Cosenza to Calabria Citeriore, Teramo to Abruzzo Llteriore Primo, Aquila to Abruzzo Ulteriore Secondo, Chieti to Abruzzo Citeriore, Campobasso to Molise, Foggia to Capitanata, Lecce to Terra d’Otranto, Bari to Terra di Bari, Avellino to Principato Ulteriore, Salerno to Principato Citeriore, Caserta to Terra di Lavoro, Potenza to Basilicata.

The following table (II.) gives the provinces, with their respective areas, according to Professor Baccarini in the xinnuario Statistico Italiano 1881, pp. 82-9, and the populations ascertained by the census of 1861 and that of December 31, 1871. The figures in. this table give a total of 114,403 square miles, slightly differing from the Maestri estimate.
[table]

Vital Statistics.— Previous to 1871 we have no census for the whole kingdom of Italy, seeing that at the previous census of 1861 the Roman territory was not yet incorporated. Approximate totals are obtainable for earlier dates by summing up the returns for the Sardinian kingdom, the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, &c., not indeed belonging to the same year, but separated from each other by comparatively slight intervals. It is thus estimated that the growth of the population of the territory now forming the kingdom [9:13:449] is represented with some approach to accuracy in the following table (HI.) :—
[table]

At this last date (1861) the population of the kingdom exclusive of the province of Rome was 21,777,334. The census of 1871 showed for the whole kingdom a total of 26,801,154; and it is estimated that this had increased by 1875 to 27,482,174, and by 1879 to 28,437,091. The census of 1861 gave 10,897,236 males and 10,880,098 females, that of 1871 13,472,213 malesand 13,328,892 females. At the latter date 36 per cent, of the population were married, and 6 per cent, in a state of widowhood.

The 1871 census shows that the males are in distinct excess of the females for the first fifteen years of life, that after that age the excess is on the side of the females, and becomes very strong between nineteen and twenty-one, and that between thirty-one and seventy-one the advantage is for the most part on the side of the males. (See Luigi Ranieri’s elaborate study in Annali di Statistica, series 2, vol. x., 1879.)

In spite of the fact that the great mass of the Italian population is engaged in agricultural pursuits, an unusual proportion of the inhabitants are congregated in towns. The Italian, to quote the words of Gallenga,^[2. Country Life in Piedmont.] is no lover of the country; he dreads of all things an isolated dwelling. If he cannot live in the capital, theιl in a provincial city; if not, in a country town; then in a village; —only not in a country house. Landowners (what in England would be known as county families), farmers, and most of the labourers huddle together in their squalid boroughsand hamlets; and the peasants have often a journey of several miles before they reach the fields entrusted to their care,—though this tendency is indeed now less marked than formerly. At the same time the number of very large cities is comparatively small. At the census of
[table]

1871 Naples ranked first with a communal population of 448,335; and there were twenty-two other towns whose inhabitants numbered about 50,000 or upwards. With the exception of four belonging to Sicily, the greater number of these λvere situated in the north. Table IV. indicates the communal population of all the towns that exceed 20,000 according to the municipal bulletins for 1879. The figures differ from those of the Movimento dello Stat. Civile, as the latter takes into account only births and deaths and not migrations.

The official reports divide the communes into urban, those with an agglomerate population of 6000 inhabitants; mixed, those in which there is a centre of 6000, but a greater number in the country districts; and rural, comprising all the others. Of the urban there were 373 in 1875, of the mixed 39, and of the rural 7873.

The following table (V.) shows the number and distribution of the greater centres of population throughout the kingdom :—
[table]

In 1877 it was found that 238 of the 8295 communes of the kingdom had no register of population, and that the aggregate population in December 1876 of the communes which were thus situated or did not keep their registers up to date was no less than 7,002,456, or more than one-fourth of the population of the country (Annali di Stat., vol. v., 1879). The statistics of the growth of the population are consequently attended with a degree of uncertainty; but the following table (VI.) exhibits the general facts since the completion of the kingdom:—
[table]

During the fifteen years 1865-79 the marriages averaged 7'48 annually in every 1000 inhabitants, the births 37’1 (104 males to 100 females), and the deaths 30'4. The average number of children (births and still-births) per marriage was 4 '68. There is very little difference in the percentage of the marriages in the urban and the rural communes; but in the matter of births and still more in deaths the urban communes stand higher than the rural. The following table (VII. ) gives the numbers per 100 of the population:—
[table]

Out of 412,981 women married in the years 1878 and 1879, 184 were under fifteen, 3183 were between fifteen and sixteen, 6610 between sixteen and seventeen, 12,067 between seventeen and eighteen, 20,546 between eighteen and nineteen, and 29,391 between nineteen and twenty; so that altogether 71,981 were married under twenty years of age. Of the men 27’28 per cent, were married before reaching their twenty -fifth year, and 80'99 per cent, before reaching their thirty-fifth year. Although marriages between uncle and niece and aunt and nephew are forbidden by the civil code, about 127 of this class of marriages are contracted annually under special licence.

Tiιe following tables (VIII., IX.) show the number of legitimate and illegitimate births in 1878 and 1879, as well as of those placed in the ruota ^[4. The ruota or o ndl·ng-wheel still exists in 1222 of the communes, being fr∣ quent in the Neapoli'an provinces and Sicily, rare in upper and middle Italy. It has been abolished in 400 communes during the last twenty years. Nor has the abolition been attended w th that increase of infanticid∙∙ which is observed in France, the Italian l>∣w being much less rigid than the French in regard to illegitimate parentage.] i or c posed, and whose parentage is unknown :—
[9:13:450]
[table]
[table]

It appears from these last figures (1879) that 10’57 per cent, of the children born in the towns, and 5 - 65 per cent, of those in the country, are eitheι ’ illegitimate or unacknowledged by their parents, and that, while the proportion of males to females is overhead 106 oi’ 107 to 100, the proportion in the case of the illegitimate is 112 in the towns. The province of Rome, the Marches, Umbria, Emilia, and Sardinia are the regions in which illegitimacy most prevails,—17,13, 12, 10, and 9 per cent, being their respective figures for 1878, while little more than 1 per cent, is shown for Campania and Apulia. It is a painful fact that in the space of ten years 305,105 children have been abandoned by their parents. The rate of infant mortality, also, speaks of ignorance and. neglect: in 1877, for example, 214,093 children (t.e,, nearly 21 per cent.) died in the first year of existence, and other 196,841 perished before they completed their tenth year.^[5. E. Raseri, “I Fanciulli illegittiιni e gli espostl in Italia " in Arch. di Stat., 1881.]

In the matter of emigration proper, it is calculated that out of every 100,000 of its population 82 leave Italy annually. The corresponding number for the United Kingdom is 350, for Belgium 230, for Denmark 110,—Italy coming next. According to the Statistica della Emigratione Ilaliana all' Estero, the total number of emigrants in the twelve years 1869-1880 is 1,407,723. Taking the figures for 1876-80 it would appear that about 37,000 Italians go every year to France, 19,000 to Austria-Hungary, 14,000 to Switzerland, 7000 to Germany, about 3000 to the other states of Europe, 20,000 to America (about a third of them to the La Plata republics), and from 2000 to 3000 to the other parts of the world. A large proportion of this body of people, however, return to their native country after a longer or shorter period of absence; and the actual loss of population by this means is reduced to about 25,000 or 30,000 per annum. The compartimenti which contribute most to the total of the permanent emigration are Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, and the Veneto; Emilia, Tuscany, Umbria, the Marches, Latium, Sicily, and Sardinia have only a very small share.

The proportion of women and children to the total number of emigrants is thus indicated (Table X. ) :—
[table]

The greater number—55 per cent.—of the emigrants proper are connected with agricultural pursuits; 16 per cent, are artisans and operatives. Genoa is by far the most important emigration port, and next, though at a great interval, comes Naples.

According to the censιrs of 1871 the population was grouped by occupation as follows:—no fewer than 8,738,565 were engaged in the production of raw materials, 3,287,188 in industrial operation«, 199,901 in commerce, and 271,003 in transport; 765,099 were supported by their property; 145,304 were engaged in the defence of the country, and 136,929 in public administration; 148,883 were connected with religion, 25,986 with justice, 54,409 with health, 52,577 with education, 41,151 with the fine arts, and 14,145 with literature and science, while no fewer than 11,773,208 are registered as without profession or as dependent on others.

Agriculture.— In the wide sense of the word, Italy is emphatically an agricultural country, and the products of its agriculture are of a very varied order. If the ratio of its grain production to the number of its population, however, be compared with the same ratio in other countries, it is surpassed by Roumania, Denmark, Russia, Prussia, France, Hungary, &c., and in fact is only a little better than Switzerland.^[6. See Some observations bearing on the Production of the several Countries mitering into the Grain Market of the World, Richmond, Virginia, 1877.] It is calculated that about 11,545,594 acres are devoted to the cultivation of wheat, and that the annual return is about 142,402,513 bushels. The average per acre is thus very low, only 12 bushels, while England obtains about 31 bushels] er acre. Next in importance to wheat comes maize (granturco, or Turkish corn), the most recently introduced of the cereals; it occupies 4,192,083 acres, and yields 85,506,660 bushels. That the cultivation of rice is less widely distributed is the natural result of the fact that it requires about 107,000 gallons of water per annum for every acre, and that its cultivation is found in many places to be extremely prejudicial to the healthiness of the locality;^[7. A contest, for instance, between the rice-growers of the territory of Casale and the other inhabitants of the district, which was carried from court to court, and finally became the subject of a Government inquiry, was terminated by a decree (1879) forbidding the cultivation of the cereal in a large district where it_ was proving a remunerative investment. See Giorn. della Soc. ltal. d'Igiene, 1879.] in certain favourable regions, however, it forms the predominant crop. The chief seat of this cereal is Novara, and more particularly the circondario of Vercelli, which alone yields about 6,875,000 bushels of rice in a year. The total acreage is 573,925 acres, with a total production of 26,998,915 bushels. Neither barley nor rye is of great importance, the 1,148,470 acres devoted to their cultivation giving 18,417,542 bushels as an average crop. More than a fourth of the acreage, and nearly a third of the produce, belong to Sicily. Oats occupy about 984,917 acres, and the return is 19,369,000 bushels. The best crops are obtained in the provinces of Caserta, Pisa, Benevento, Milan, and Foggia. Mdlet (Panicum miliaceum), panico (Panicum italicum), and sorghum (Holcus saccharatms) are mainly employed as forage,—the first of the three, which was formerly of importance as an article of human food, having been in that regard displaced by maize. Buckwheat (the grano Saraceno of the popular language) is hardly grown outside of the provinces of Cuneo, Como, Belluno, and Treviso. The manufacture of rnaccaroni and similar foodstuff is well known as a characteristic Italian industry. It is pretty extensively distributed, and is often carried on in very primitive fashion. The extent of the industry may be judged from the fact that, while the Italians themselves consume enormous quantities, they are at the same time able to export from 50,000 to 70,000 quintals of “pastes.”

Beans are a very common crop—those belonging to the genera Phaseolus and Dolichos being known as fagioli, and those of the genus Faba us fave. Of the former’ no fewer than thirty-five varieties were exhibited by the board of agriculture at the Paris exhibition in 1878. Those most commonly cultivated are the white haricots. In many places a crop of beans is obtained from the field just cleared of the wheat. Lentils are grown in most parts of the country, —a small sort being that most in favour. Pease hold a less important place than that assigned to them in more northern lands. The total area under beans (fagioli— the fave are not included in this estimate), pease, and lentils is calculatedat 773,100 acres, and the produce at 6,664,500 bushels. Lupines are extensively cultivated both for winter forage and to serve as a manure. Lupinus albus is the variety most usual in Central and Northern Italy. Lupinus rarius —which does not do so well for green fodder—is most usual in the south. Lathyrus sativus, a congener of the sweet pea of English gardens, is sown as food for pigs,—its use as an article of human consumption gradually diminishing as it has been recently proved that, as Hippocrates long ago asserted, it has a tendency to bring on paralysis of the limbs.

The potato is now found as a common object of cultivation in nearly every region of Italy except the provinces of Mantua, Girgenti, and Trapani. For field cultivation the variety still almost universally in vogue is that introduced by the grand-dukes of Tuscany at the beginning of the 17th century. It is calculated that the total crop of potatoes may average 19,387,000 bushels. Turnips are pretty largely grown, more especially in the central districts of the peninsula, for use as winter fodder for the cattle. Many attempts have been made to introduce the cultivation of beet, but the plant does not succeed to much satisfaction.

Gardening is seldom carried on in Italy on a large or expensive scale, except in the neighbourhood of such places as Milan, Genoa, Florence, Palermo, Catania, and Naples. Some of the marketgardens in the outskirts of this last city, however, are said to bring in about £32 per acre, and to be let for £14 or £15. Forcing is seldom resorted to. Among the plants most largely cultivated in the ordinary gardens are various kindsof cabbage, lettuces, fennel, asparagus, spinach, beet, garlic and onions, gourds, melons and cucumbers, and tomatoes. The fennel is eaten both raw and cooked,—often instead of fruit after dinner. The asparagus is seldom bleached.

With the exception of rape, colza, and linseed, few of the oil seeds are grown to any considerable extent. The sun-flower is cultivated on a small scale in the Veneto, and the ground nut (Aradiis hypogaea) in a few places in Lombardy. The annual crop of the castor-oil plant (which has become wild in Sicily and in Verona) is estimated at 6,000,000 lb of seed. Sesamum, formerly common in the Bologna and Lucca districts, is now almost confined to Sicily. Madder used to be largely cultivated in the provinces of Naples and Caserta (in the former 27,000 acres were devoted to it as late as 1863), but in Italy as elsewhere the dye plants are becoming of less importance. The collecting of saffron is also less common than it used to be. In [9:13:451] southern Tuscany (at Piacenza, Moutepulciano, and Siena) it was formerly an important industry; now it chiefly flourishes in the province of Aquila and other parts of the Napoletano, and in the island of Sicily. Aniseed is abundantly grown in the Romagna and the Abruzzi; the province of Aquila produces about 800 quintals per annum. Liquorice grows wild in all the southern part of the peninsula, and in some portions of Sicily is considered a vile weed; but in certain localities, as in the province of Teramo, it is the object of regular cultivation.

The vine is cultivated throughout the length and breadth of Italy, but in not a few of the provinces its relative importance is slight. While in some of the districts of the south and the centre the vine occupies from 10 to 20 per cent, of the cultivated area, in some of the northern provinces, such as Sondrio, Belluno, Grosseto, &c., the average is only about 1 or 2 per cent. The methods of cultivation are sufficiently varied; but the planting of the vines by themselves in long rows of insignificant bushes is decidedly the exception. In Lombardy, Emilia, Romagna, Tuscany, the Marches, Umbria, the Terra di Lavoro, and other southern provinces, they are trained to trees which are either left in their natural state or subjected to pruning and pollarding. In Campania and Terra di Lavoro the vines are allowed to climb freely to the tops of the poplars much as they would do in their native woods; but the wines obtained by this system of cultivation are said to be of inferior quality. In the rest of Italy the elm and the maple are the trees mainly employed as supports. Artificial props of several kinds—wires, cane work, trellis work, &c.—are also in use in many districts, and in some the plant is simply permitted to trail along the ground. The vintage takes place, according to locality and climate, from the beginning of September to the beginning of November. Table XI. gives details for the different districts :—
[table]

Next to the cereals and the vine the most important object of cultivation in Italy is the olive. In Sicily and the provinces of Reggio, Catanzaro, Cosenza, and Lecce this tree flourishes freely and without shelter; as far north as Rome, Aquila, and Teramo it requires only the slightest protection; in the rest of the peninsula it runs the risk of damage by frost every ten years or so. The proportion of ground under olives is no less than from 20 to 36 per cent, at Porto Maurizio, and in Reggio, Lecce, Bari, Chieti, and Leghorn it averages from 10 to 19 per cent. Throughout Piedmont, Lombardy, the Veneto, and the greater part of Emilia, the tree is of little importance, though in a number of the provinces it is cultivated on a small scale. In the olive there is great variety of kinds, and the methods of cultivation differ greatly in different districts; in Bari, Chieti, and Lecce, for instance, there are regular woods of nothing but olive-trees, while in middle Italy we have olive-orchards with the interspaces occupied by crops of various kinds. The Tuscan oils from Lucca, Calci, and Buti are considered the best in the world; and those of Bari, Umbria, and western Liguria rank next. The following table (XII.) indicates more particularly the distribution of the cultivation :—
[table]

The cultivation of oranges, lemons, and their congeners (collectively designated in Italian by thetermαgτwni)isof somewhat modern date, the introduction of the Citrus Bigaradia being probably due to the Arabs; but it has received so great a development in certain parts of the country as to be highly characteristic. Sicily stands jacile princeps in this respect,—the area occupied by the agrumeti or lemon and orange orchards in the province of Palermo alone having increased from 11,525 acres in 1854 to 54,340 in 1874. lleggio, Calabria, Catanzaro, Cosenza, Lecce, Salerno, Naples, and Caserta are the continental provinces which come next after Sicily. In Sardinia the cultivation is extensive, but receives little attention. Crude lime-juice is exported from Italy to the amount of about 10,000 quintals annually, and concentrated lime-juice to the amount of from 11,000 to 17,000 quintals. Essential oils are extracted from the rind of the agrami, more particularly from that of the lemon and the bergamot; the latter, however, is almost confined to the province of Reggio Calabria, where the average production amounts to 220,000 lb,—an enormous quantity when it is remembered that 1000 bergamots are required for every lb. A perfume called acqua nanfa·, or lanfa, is obtained from the distillation of the orange-flowers, and the petals are also made into a conserve at Syracuse. Of the agrumi in their natural state the exportation has increased from 832,410 quintals (value 24,139,890 lire^[8. The Italian lira corresponds in value to the franc. 25 lire = £1 sterling.]) in 1873 to 1,007,585 (value 36,022,575 lire) in 1877. In Southern Italy almonds, carob-trees, and figs are cultivated on a very extensive scale. The value of the almonds exported in 1876 (a favourable year) amounted to 13,570,000 lire. Walnuts are mainly grown in Piedmont, and particularly in the province of Cuneo; hazels, on the contrary, have their greatest diffusion in the south, and particularly in the island of Sicily and the province of Avellino.^[9. The hazel has its specific name, Corylus avellana, from the fact here mentioned.] The value of the export of walnuts and hazels amounts to between 3,000,000 and 4,000,000 lire per annum. Pistachio culture is confined to the province of Caltanisetta.

The great variety in physical and social conditions which exists throughout the peninsula gives corresponding variety to the methods of agriculture. In the matter for instance of rotation of .crops there is an amazing diversity—shifts of two years, three years, four years, six years, and in many cases whatever order strikes the fancy of the farmer. The fields of Tuscany for the most part bear wheat one year and maize the next, in perpetual interchanges, relieved to some extent by green crops. A similar method prevails in the Abruzzi, and in the provinces of Salerno, Benevento, and Avellino. In the plains of Lombardy a six year shift is common :—either wheat, clover, maize, rice, rice, rice (the last year manured with lupines), or maize, wheat followed by clover, clover, clover ploughed in and rice, rice, and rice manured with lupines. The Emilian region is one where regular rotations are best observed,—a common shift being grain, maize, clover, beans and vetches, &c., grain, which has the disadvantage of the grain crops succeeding each other. In the province of Naples, Caserta, &c., the method of fallows is widely adopted, the ground· often being left in this state for fifteen or twenty years; and in some parts of Sicily there is a regular interchange of fallow and crop year by year. The following scheme indicates a common Sicilian method of a type which has many varieties :—fallow, grain, grain, pasture, pasture—other two divisions of the area following the same order, but commencing respectively with the two years of grain and the two of pasture.

In the matter of implements the Italian agriculturist is far behind. The old Roman plough, for instance, as it is described by Virgil and Columella, may still be seen in use in various parts of the country; in Sardinia the plough that figures on the ancient monuments of the island might have been copied from that at work in the fields. Great improvements, however, have taken place in the more progressive regions; iron has replaced wood, and coulter and share have been increased in massiveness. But even in the Veneto the heavy plough drawn by as many it may be as six pair of oxen cuts the furrow no deeper than 9 inches. As we proceed southwards the fashion becomes more simple and antique. The spade or vanga is a favourite implement, and in some parts, as in Emilia for instance, it is used to deepen the furrow made by the plough. Sowing and reaping machines have been successfully introduced in the lowland regions, but a large proportion of the country is little fitted for their employment.^[10. A suggestive table of the proportion of mountainous and lowland country in the several provinces will be found in the Studii published by the Geographical Society in 1875. It is reprinted in the Annuario Stat, for 1881. According to this, the mountainous area is considerably in excess of the lowland.] Thrashing machines even in the remoter districts have largely displaced the flail and the floor; and straw cutters, com-shellers, and similar inventions have begun to make their way. Manuring even of a very ordinary kind is but little attended to in a great part of the country; though it has been a custom from time immemorial to grow a crop of lupines for the sole purpose of returning them to the soil as a stimulus.

Though Italy is so distinctively an agricultural country, and has been subject so long to regular process of cultivation, a large proportion of its arable land is still in astate of utter neglect. It is calculated that the aggregate of the more important districts ready to give abundant increase in return for the labour of reclamation amounts to 571,000 acres; anil more than twice that quantity might be utilized. The most important works undertaken in this, direction since the formation of the kingdom are the draining df Lago Fucino and Lago Trasimeno, and the great scheme for the improvement of the “Agro Romano” decreed by parliament on 11th December 1878.

The breed of cattle most widely distributed throughout Italy is that known as the Podolian, usually with white or grey coat and enormous horns. Of the numerous sub-varieties, the finest is said to be that of the Vai di Chiana, where the animals are stall-fed all the year round; and next to this is ranked the so-called Valle Tiberina type. The wilder and ruder varieties are those which roam in vast herds over the Tuscan and Roman maremmas, and the corresponding districts in Apulia and other regions. In the Alpine [9:13:452] districts there is a stock cμιite distinct from the Podolian, generally called razza montanina. These animals are much smaller in stature and more regular in form than their Podolian cousins; and they are mainly kept for dairy purposes. Another stock, with no close allies nearer than the south of France, is found in the plain of Kaceonigi and Carmagnola; the mouse-coloured Swiss breed, occurs in the neighbourhood of Milan; the Tyrolese breed stretches south to Padua and Modena; and a red-coated breed named of Reggio or Friuli, is familiar both in what were the duchies of Parma and Modena, and in the provinces of Udine and Treviso. Other less important types exist in the southern parts of the peninsula; in Sicily the so-called Modica race is of note; and in Sardinia there is a very distinct stock which seldom exceeds the weight of 700 lb. Buffaloes are kept in several districts, more particularly of Southern Italy. Their total number is estimated at 15,190.

Sheep are not reared in any considerable numbers by the agriculturists of Italy; but enormous flocks are possessed by professional sheep-farmers, who pasture them in the mountains in the summer, and bring them down to the plains in the winter. The breeds vary from region to region. At Saluzzo in Piedmont there is a stock with hanging ears, arched face, and tall stature, kept for its dairy qualities; and in the Biellese the merino breed is maintained by some of the larger proprietors. In the upper valleys of the Alps there are many local varieties, one of which at Ossola is like the Scotch blackface. Liguria is not much adapted for sheep-farming on a large scale; but a number of small flocks come down to the plain of Tuscany in the winter. With the exception of a few sub-Alpine districts near Bergamo and Brescia, the great Lombard plain is decidedly unpastoral. The Bergamo sheep is the largest breed in the country; and that of Cadore and Belluno approaches it in size. In the Venetian districts the farmers often nave small stationary flocks. Throughout the Roman province, and Umbria, Apulia, the Capitanata, and the Calabrias, we find in its full development a remarkable system of pastoral migration which has been in existence from the most ancient times, and which has attracted attention as much by its picturesqueness as by its industrial importance. Merino sheep have been acclimatized in the Abruzzi, the Caρitanata, and the Basilicata. The total number of sheep in the kingdom is estimated at nearly 7,000,009, and that of goats at more than 1,500,000. According to returns for 1876 (the figures of which are almost certainly below the mark) the cattle amount to 3,489,125, the horses to 657,544, the asses to 498,766, the mules to 293,868, and the pigs to 1,553,582.^[11. Most of the facts in this survey of Italian agriculture are borrowed from L'Italia agraria e forestale, prepared by the Italian Board of Agriculture for the Paris Exhibition, 1878.]

The north of Italy has long been known for its great dairy districts. Parmesan cheese, otherwise called Lodigiano (from Lodi) or grana, was presented to King Louis XII. as early as 1509. In 1878 there were in the province of Parma alone one hundred and sixtyseven caselli or dairies, manipulating about l,830,554gallons of milk, and manufacturing 26,091 Parmesan cheeses of aggregate weight of 927,315 lb, besides' 6963 tt> of the variety of Stracchino, 2318 lb of Gorgonzola, 324,062 lb of butter, and 497,442 of ricotta ^[12. Ricotta means “recooked." It is the residue of cream separated from butter-milk by boiling.] (compare Annali di Agricoltura, No. 9). Between 1864 and 1873 the value of the cheese increased from 1'66 lire to 2 - 75 lire per lb. Parmesan is not confined to the province from which it derives its name; it is manufactured in all that part of Emilia which is in the neighbourhood of the Po, and in the provinces of Brescia, Bergamo, Pavia, Novara, and Alessandria. Gorgonzola, which takes its name from a town in the province, has become general throughout the whole of Lombardy, in the eastern parts of the “ancient provinces,” and in the province of Cuneo. The cheese known as the caccio-cavallo, which when two or three years old is worth three or four lire the kilogramme, is produced in regions extending from 37° to 43° N. lat. Gruyère, so extensively manufactured in Switzerland and France, is also produced in Italy in the Alpine regions andin Sicily. With the exception of Parmesan, Gorgonzola, La Fontina, and Gruyère, most of the Italian cheese is consumed in the locality of its production. It is estimated that in 1879 England imported upwards of 3000 Parmesans and 5000 Gorgonzolas. The institution known as the lattcria sociale, or co-operative dairy-farm has been in use in Parma for centuries, and is a familiar arrangement in many districts. For further details on this interesting industry the reader may consult Cantoni’s Pindustria del latte, and the account of the esposizione di caseificio, held at Portici in 1877, in the Annali di Agricoltura, 1879. The extent of the butter exportation is seen from Table XXII., p. 456. France is the great market for the fresh butter; but it appears that England is rapidly becoming a customer of some importance; instead of 10 tons, as in 1875, it received 500 tons in 1879-80.

Among the various methods by which the relation of the landholder to the tiller of the soil is regulated, the more noteworthy are the mezzadria (mezzeria or metayer) system, the boaria or schiaven-

deria, the economia, and the aflittanza or affittamento. This last is practically the same as the ordinary renting system in England and Scotland, the rent sometimes being paid in money (affitto a danari), sometimes in kind (affitto a grano), sometimes partly in money and partly in kind, and the periods varying from one year to leasesof six or nine years. In the typical mezzadria the owner receives frequently one half of the produce of the soil, and the mezzadro or farmer the other; but of course there are many minor modifications in the terms of the contract.^[13. Caruso, for instance, in his work on Sistemi d'amministrazione, describes a variety in use at Gallico, in Reggio Calabria. In order to establish new agrumeti, or orange orchards, advantage is taken of the following arrangements. The peasant undertakes to dig the holes, to furnish and place the cuttings, and to watch and take care of the plants up to the seventh year. The magoli, or interspaces between the rows, he cultivates as a garden, and pays for this a rent of about 229 lire per hectare. The produce of the orchard is divided equally between contadino and landlord, and at the end of the seventh year, the value of the garden being estimated, the former receives a third of the amount, and the landlord remains in full possession of the rest.] The live-stock is usually the property of the mezzadro, who.pays a fixed rent for the use of the pasturage. By the terzeria system, on the other hand, the animals and plant are the property of the landholder, or two-thirds his and one-third the tenant’s. Under the schiavenderia or boaria system, the boario (so called from his care of the cattle) receives such a quantity of the produce of the soil or of money as pays for his labour, and the landlord remains practically his own farmer. The live stock of course is the landlord’s property, but the boario has a right to certain perquisites connected with this department of his labour. Economia is the name given to a system by which “the holder of the land, whether landlord or tenant, pays certain families who perform under his direction, with his capital and at his risk, the various labours of cultivation.” The peculiar conditions of certain parts of the country produce peculiar arrangements: the Roman Campagna, for example, which could not be permanently inhabited owing to the malaria, used to be cultivated in the following fashion. Companies of peasants from the Abruzzi, the Marches, &c., under the direction of chiefs or “corporals,” performed the work of sowing the fields in the autumn, and returned in June to gather in the harvest, —the tenants of the farms usually making considerable profits from the undertaking. For further details on this subject the reader may consult the Reports respecting the Tenure of Land in the several Countries of Europe (1869-1870) presented to the English parliament in 1870, and the Monografie agricole, published by Professor Luigi Bodio, Whose name has so frequently to be mentioned with honour in connexion with the statistics of his country. Table XIII., which is collected from the reports on the Contratti agrari in
[table]
[9:13:453]

the last work, indicates very strikingly the great irregularity of the distribution of the various forms of contracts. The rent system would appear to be gaining ground, and the mezzadria and similar methods to be losing in importance.^[14. On the rnezzôdria system, sec also A. Rabbeno, Sulla mezzadria nd sιtoi rapport ι, 1874.] Manufactures.— Though Italy is pre-eminently an agricultural country, its manufacturing industries are of considerable importance, and some of them have a long and varied history. Of chief note is the silk trade,—though it has suffered greatly from the silkworm disease which broke out in 1854. Accordingto De Vecchi (Arch. di Stak, 1876) the total annual production of raw silk in Italy previously amounted to 7,612,000 ft; in 1865 it was reduced to 3,876,400 lb, but it has since considerably recovered its ground. The average, indeed, for the ten years 1868-1877 is given by the same authority as 5,753,880 lb; and according to the report of Luigi Maccia to the Milan chamber of commerce in 1881 the cocoon harvest amounted in 1878 to 81,843,740 lb, in 1879 to 41,648,200 ft, and in 1880 to 79,546,280 lb, which would represent in round numbers 5,500,000 lb of raw silk for the first year, 2,798,000 lb for the second, and 5,345,000 for the third.

The following table (XIV.) from the same report indicates, with approximate accuracy, the contributions of the different regions to these totals:—
[table]

As a silk-producing country in fact Italy ranks second only to China, and leaves all its other competitors far behind. The culture is carried on in at least 5300 communes, andin 1877 it was calculated that 4839 men, 81,165 women, and 25,373 children were employed in the unwinding of the cocoons—an operation which was formerly effected for the most part by the growers themselves, but has now passed into the hands of those who can bring better appliances and more modern methods to bear. The district in which the unwinding is most extensively carried on is Lombardy, and it is there too that improvements in the process are most widely adopted: while in the Veneto, for example, there are 10,031 of the old-fashioned ovens to 4698 of the modern steam apparatuses, in Lombardy the latter number 29,576 and the former only 9305. If we turn to what is more distinctively the manufacture of the silk, we find the pre-eminence of Lombardy more strongly emphasized. The position it occupies is evident from the following table (XV.) :—
[table]

The raw material for these silk-throwing factories is partly obtained from abroad, in spite of the large home supply already indicated; fora considerable proportion of this—though much less than was formerly the case—is exported for manufacture at Lyons and elsewhere. According to Signor Fuzier in his Paris exhibition report, 44,000,000 lb of silk from other European countries, and 176,000,000 Γb from Asia, are worked up by the Italian spinners. The special department of cascami employs about 27,000 spindles in Jesi, Novara, Meina, and Zuniglio.

In silk-weaving Italy stands comparatively low. Signor Ellena, general director of the customs,^[15. A latge proportion of the facts mentioned in this section on the manufaot tires are borrowed from V. Ellena ’ s paper in Arch, di Stat, 1880.] estimates the number of looms at from 10,000 to 12,000, of which only 665 were power-looms—very meagre totals in comparison with those even of the Swiss canton of Zurich, which numbers about 1000 power-looms and 40,000 handlooms. Lombardy (especially the town of Como)is again the principal seat of the industry, Campania ranking second, an 1 Piedmont third.

Next in importance to the silk industry stands the cotton manufacture. During the American war the cultivation of cotton in Italy received a rematkable but temporary stimulus. In 1864 it occupied about 227,645 acres, and the produce amounted to 622,896 quintals, but the corresponding figures for 1873 were only 85,422 acres and 180,230 quintals. In 1877 Italy had only about 880,000 cotton spindles, or rather more than Belgium; and these consumed about 264,000 quintals of the fibre. Liguria and Piedmont contain the greatest number of spinning mills. In the number of its cotton looms, however, Lombardy stands highest, and Liguria, Piedmont, and Campania follow. The total number for the country is stated at more than 13,000. Of the cotton goods the great proportion consists in the coarser fabrics,—muslins, tulles, &c., being obtained almost exclusively from abroad. The average importation of cotton yarn for the ten years 1870-1879 amounted to 109,000 quintals, and that of cotton fabrics during the same period to 116,000 quintals.

As has been already seen, Italy is a great wool-growing country; and while it exports about 1,760,000 lb of the native produce, it imports, mainly from South America, a quantity varying from 10,382,680 ft in 1870 to 18,983,600 ft in 1879. The following table (XVI.) indicates the extent of the industry, which, unlike that of cotton, has a long and in parts brilliant history in the country :—
[table]

More than 3000 hands are further employed in the shoddy trade. With few exceptions, the Italian factories receive the wool in its raw state from the grower, and perform in succession all the various operations of washing, scouring, carding, dyeing, weaving, and dressing. They manage to supply a large part of the home demand, and also export a small quantity of goods.

The flax and hemp industries have been prosecuted in Italy for centuries; but a large proportion of the manufacture is still carried on by hand-loom weavers working in their own houses—to the number probably of more than 68,000. The following table (XVII.) indicates the distribution of the factories: —
[9:13:454]
[table]

The manufacture of jute is quite insignificant :—two weaving factories in Lombardy and Liguria, and spinning mills at Crema, Poirina, and Grugliasco. It is estimated that about 8400 hands are employed in the making of ropes and cordage; and of the produce in this department there is a very considerable export, varying in the ten years 1870-79 from a minimum of 20,797 quintals in 1870 to a maximum of 36,908 in 1873. The factories that produce mixed fabrics are 210 in number, and upwards of 5000 hands are employed in them.

The extent to which weaving is carried on in the simple domestic fashion has been indicated in connexion with the linen trade; it also maintains its ground in several of the other departments, and the. popular prejudice—it prejudice it be—in favour of the firm-wrought fabrics that are thus produced will long keep the clack of the solitary loom familiar to the inhabitants of many a town and village. It is said that there are at least 230,000 of them at work throughout the country.

The making of felt hats, which gives employment to nearly 5000 hands, is mainly carried on in Piedmont, and particularly in the circondario of Biella and at Intra. The produce is for the most part of a coarse quality, but finds a market not only in Italy but also in France, Austria and Switzerland, the Argentine Confederation, and Tunis. The trade in straw hats is rapidly growing in importance: while in 1867 the number exported was only 7661, it rose in 1877 to 4,526,000.

Owing to the abundance of the raw material, Italy has long been successful in the manufacture of paper from linen rags according to the old-fashioned processes; and the development of the more modern methods has been fostered by the ready availability of water power, though on the other hand the outlays for chemicals, machinery, and fuel are serious drawbacks. The supply of home-made paper is far in excess of the demand, and there is a corresponding excess of export over import, more especially in blottirg and packing papers. The imported paper is almost exclusively of the finer qualities. According to Signor Avondo, the annual quantity of rags obtained in Italy is 88,000,000 lb. There was formerly a great export of rags to America in the shape of packing material for marble-blocks.

In the manufacture of leather and skins Italy has long been successfully engaged: and though the industry has now to compete" with the new enterprise of India and America, the annual production is valued at £4,000,000. The staple article is shoe leather; in the finer departments—such as kid skins—foreign competition is too strong for the full development of the native industry. It is estimated that there are upwards of 1300 works in the country, employing more than 10,000 hands.

A private company, established in 1868 under the name of Regia Cointeressata, secured for fifteen years the exclusive privilege of manufacturing and selling tobacco in continental Italy and Sardinia, on condition of paying to the state an annual rent and a certain proportion of the gains after the rent was deducted. In the period 1869-1870 the rent was to be 66,894,811 lire, in the second period (1871-74) 72,293,032, in the third (1875-1878) 79,484,891, and for the fourth (1879-1884) 93,000,000. Up to 1875 the Government share in the ultimate profit was fixed at 40 per cent., and from 1875 at 50 per cent. The results of this arrangement have not been equal to the anticipations formed in regard to them. In 1877, however, the Regia extended its control to the island of Sicily.

According to the regulation of 1879 the cultivation of tobacco for exportation is permitted in any part of the country on payment of a licence, while the cultivation for the inland monopoly is restricted to certain regions annually determined, and within these regions no cultivation for export can be carried on. The rules are of a very rigid description. The provinces in which the monopoly cultivation has usually been located are Vicenza, Ancona, Perugia, Rome, Benevento, Salerno, Lecce, Sassari, Catania, and Messina. The total area of the ground so occupied was only 4500 hectares (11,120 acres) in 1877; to satisfy the national demand from internal sources would require from 18,000 to 20,000 hectares (44,480 to 49,420 acres). On an average it is calculated that every inhabitant of Italy uses about 5 oz. of snuff, 10 oz. of cut tobacco, and 9⅜ oz. of cigars annually—the total expense being 5*518 lire or 4s. βd. per head.

The manufacture of oils is among the most flourishing of the minor industries, and the demand which it makes on foreign countries for supplies of raw material is rapidly increasing. The amount of oil-seeds imported in 1870 was 27,000 quintals, in 1879 211,400 quintals. And at the same time the consumption of the oils within the country exceeds the quantity manufactured, so that the excess of the import over the export of oil in 1879, for instance, was 135,660 quintals. There are 437 oil works in the kingdom (198 in Lombardy), and they employ nearly 2000 hands. Rape, linseed, ricinus, ground-nuts, and sesamum are all made use of, especially the first and last. Soap works are said to number as many as 537 (151 in Sicily alone, and 87 in Apulia), and to engage 1770 men, 135 women, and 179 children; and the exportation of soap, which was less than a third of the importation in 1870, has increased till the excess is strongly in its favour. The 10 stearine-candle factories employ upwards of 500 hands, and form the nucleus of what may be a large industry.

The sugar manufacture is of limited extent. During the Austrian rule it was carried on in Lombardy and Venice with the support of the state; but the political changes proved fatal to its existence, and it was not till 1872 that the first sugar refinery of the kingdom of Italy was established at Samρierdarena. This, however, proved a flourishing business, and supplied about one quarter of the entire consumption of Italy, which was estimated at 176,000,000 tt>; in 1876 it employed 500 hands, and carried on distilling operations. Beet-root sugar has been manufactured since 1869 at Anagni, where the factory was formerly protected and privileged by the Papal Government; and there are other factories at Rieti, Cesa (in the Val di Chiana), &c. (English Parliamentary Papers:— Reports on Sugar Industries in Foreign Countries, 1876.)

In 1877 there were 9583 distilleries in the country, and 370 manufactories of aerated waters. The brewing establishments amounted to 145, and manufactured 2,488,838 gallons. Both barley and hops are largely imported from abroad, the hops mainly from Austria and Germany. In the following table (XVIII.) the first column indicates the quantity of beer annually imported, the second the quantity annually made in the country:—
[table]

The iron manufacture has increased in importance in Italy during the last decade. In 1872 the production of wrought iron and steel was estimated at 48,909 tons; in 1877 it was 73,000 tons, and 12,000 hands were employed in the works. Liguria has the credit of nearly half of the total amount. The works at Savona, Voltri, and Pra, at Vobarno near Lake Garda, and at Vai d’Elsa deserve mention. Some of these have furnaces of the Siemens type.

Considerable progress has also been made in the manufacture of machinery; the number of men employed in this department (the Government factories being omitted) increased from less than 12,000 in 1872 to 15,000 in 1877. The Italian mechanicians do not seek to compete with foreigners in the production of large steam engines and hydraulic motors, but devote their attention to the minor kinds of machinery for wool and cotton factories, dye works, railways, &c.

The principal chemical works are those of sulphuric acid at Milan, Turin, Naples, and Genoa, of hydrochloric acid at Milan, of nitric acid at Milan and Avigliana near Turin, of carbon disulphide at Bari, Pisa, San Giuliano, and of quinine at Milan and Genoa. This last manufacture, though it only dates from 1870, exceeds that of any other European country. The quinine is partly exported to Russia. Tartaric acid, as a matter of course in a wine-growing country, is produced in abundance. Glue-making is also a widely diffused industry, and the manufacture of artificial manures, which was carried on in 32 factories in 1878, is increasing in importance. India-rubber works exist at Milam

In the various ceramic arts Italy was at one time unrivalled, but the ancient tradition has long lost its primeval impulse;^[16. A curious instance of the tenacity of popular art tradition in the country is furnished by the fact that some of the long-lost processes of Etιuscan pottery have been found in use at St Angelo in Vado, a remote corner of the Marches. See Aless. Castellani in Amer. Ass. for Ad". of Science, 1876.] and even where the industry remains the art has for the most part perished. The works at Vinovo, which had fame in the 18th century, came to an untimely end in 1820; those of Castelli (in Abruzzo Ult. I.) were supplanted by Charles III.’s establishment at Capo-dimontc[9:13:455], 1750, winch after producing articles of surprising execution was closed before the end of the century. The first place now belongs to the Della Doccia works at Florence. Founded in 1735 by the marquis Carlo Ginori, they maintained a reputation of the very highest kind down to about 1860; but since then they have not kept pace with their younger rivals in other lands. They still, however, are commercially successful, producing to the value of 700,000 or 800,000 lire, and employing 600 workers. Other cities where the ceramic industries keep their ground are Pesaro, Gubbio, Faenza (whose name long ago became the distinctive term for the finer kind of potter’s work in France, faience), Savona and Albissola, Turin, Mondovi, Cuneo, Castellamonte (more than 30 establishments, 500 workmen), Milan, Brescia, Sassuolo, Imola, Rimini, Pemgia, Castelli, &c. It is estimated that the total production of the finer wares amounts on the average to 10,000,000 lire per annum. The ruder branches of the art—the making of tiles and common wares—is pretty generally diffused. (For further details see Giuseppe Corona’s Report on the French Exhibition of 1878, Class XX., “Ceramica,” Rome, 1880.)

The jeweller’s art as a matter of course received large encouragement in a country which had so many independent courts; but nowhere has it attained a fuller development than at Rome. A vast variety of trinkets—-in coral, glass, lava, &c.—is exported from Italy, or carried away by the annual host of tourists. In 1877, for example, while 388 quintals of raw coral were imported, 563 quintals of wrought coral were exported, and in the same year no less than 22,891 quintals of imitation jewellery in glass. The copying of the paintings of the old masters is becoming an art industry of no small mercantile importance in some of the larger cities.^[17. See, for example, the notice of Venice in British Consular Reports, 1879.]

The production of mosaics is an art industry still carried on with much success in Italy, which indeed ranks exceedingly high in the department. The great works of the Vatican are especially famous (more than 17,000 distinct tints are employed in their productions)* and there are many other establishments in Rome. The Florentine mosaics are perhaps better known abroad; they arc composed of larger pieces than the Roman. Those of the Venetian artists are remarkable for the boldness of their colouring.

The small amount of capital accumulated in the country, the heavy expenses involved in the importation of much of the machinery necessary for the larger industries, the comparative inexpertness of the mass of the operatives, and the difficulty consequent upon these and other circumstances of competing with foreign manufacturers who can produce at a cheaper r⅛te—these are some of the reasons of the backward state of Italian manufacturing industry. The inexpertness of the operatives—due to lack of experience and of education—is the more noteworthy because it counteracts the advantage to be derived from the cheapness of labour. The principle of the division of labour has comparatively limited application. From the same factory, for instance, may be obtained ploughshares and theodolites.

Fisheries.— As the coast-line of Italy extends to about 3937 miles (of which 1048 belong to the islands), the prosecution of the fisheries in the neighbouring seas is carried on from a great many points. The following table (XIX.) gives the principal statistics of date 1879, for the various “compartimenti” or districts into which the coast is usually divided:—
[table]

To complete the total for Trapani, it is necessary to add 26 boats with 471 hands, which are employed in the sponge fishery off Tunis. For Italy, as for the other Mediterranean nations, the tunny fishing is of considerable moment. The more important stations are those in Sicily, Sardinia, and Elba. Apart from local consumption the annual value of the Sardinian fishery is estimated at 4,000,000 lire, and that of Sicily at about half as much.

The anchovy and sardine fisheries are carried on by Italian boats, not only on the Ligurian and Tuscan coasts, but on those of France, Spain, Barbary, Dalmatia, and Istria. Among the stations which take an active share in this department are Sestri and Riva,

Cecina and Castiglione, Porto Ercole, Porto Longone in Elba, Ancona, and Chioggia. The success of the fishermen is now seldom so great as it was before 1868; and 2 lire per day is the most that can be gained in the best months at the better stations. The annual value of the sardines brought to Terracina is stated at 6300 lire, and that of the anchovies at 7000; and the corresponding figures for Porto d’Anzio and Palermo are respectively 98,000 and 32,000 lire, 200,000 and 400,000. Civita Vecchia has a total for the two kinds of 15,000 lire.

Sword-fish {Xiphias gladius) are not only constantly caught in the nets of the tunny-fishers, but from time immemorial have been the object of special pursuit, the weapon mainly used against them being a species of harpoon or drafineria. As many as fifty fish may be caught in a single day off the coast of Sicily, and twenty off the coasts of Calabria. Each fish weighs on an average from 220 to 440 lb; and the quantity captured in the season in the two districts indicated may amount to 308,000 lb.

Coral is obtained in various parts of the Italian waters, more especially in the neighbourhood of the island of Elba and the Gulf of Naples, and the Italian coral fishers extend their voyages to the African coast and the islands of Cape Verd. In 1869 it was stated that upwards of 490 vessels, of 2712 tons total burden, were employed in the department, by far the greater proportion of them belonging to Torre del Greco. The statistics given in Table XIX. show but little change. The hardships endured by the more adventurous fishers are extremely’ severe, and the gain is comparatively slight. (Compare Green’s Stray Studies, 1879, for a description of the coral fishers of Capri.)

Of special importance are the lagoon fisheries of Orbetello, of the Mare Piccolo of Taranto, the Lago Verzimino or Salpi, and the Lago di Varano, and more particularly of Comacchio. Eels, soles, mullets, and various other kinds of fish are there obtained in enormous quantities.^[18. See Friedländer, La Pesca nelle lagune di Comacchio, 1872, and compare the article Cojγacchio. For full details on the v holequesιion of the Italian fisheries see Espoz. intern, di Pesca in Berlino, 1880, Sezione Italiano, Florence, 1880.] Condition of the Lower Classes.— Though mitigated to some degree by the mildness of the climate and the cheapness of certain articles of food, pauperism in its most painful forms is a widespread evil in Italy’. At Venice, out of a total population of 130,000, 36,000 are regular recipients of official charity. The slums of Naples are foul ami overcrowded as the slums of London. Nor is the destitution confined to the cities. The condition of the agricultural labourers is in many cases deplorable. In the districts of Como, Milan, Pavia, and Lodi, the food of the contadino, according to F. Cardani and F. Massara, consists of maize bread, badly cooked, heavy’ and rancid, and thin soup composed of rice or .“pasta” of inferior quality and vegetables often old and spoiled. In Soutirera Italy, says Villari, the peasants live in miserable houses, with a sack of straw for their bed, and black bread for their sole sustenance. Maize is the general food stuff in the northern ami central provinces, but begins to he rarer in Tuscany and Rome; it is again widely diffused in the upper provinces of Naples; but in Calabria and Apulia it forms the principal nutriment of scarcely a fourth of the communes, and in Sicily it disappears almost completely. In Piedmont, Lombardy, and the Veneto it is used mainly in the form of polenta, hut also in the form of bread, and in the Napoletano in the form of a finer kind of polenta. Lombardy, the Veneto, Emilia, and the Marches are the regions where wheaten bread is least employed by the peasants. Barley is mainly consumed in Apulia and Calabria, rye in Sicily and Lombardy. In certain communes of the Marches and the Abruzzi acorns constitute the ordinary diet of the poor. Wheaten pastes are most extensively employed by the people in Liguria, Sicily, and the upper Neapolitan provinces. Animal food holds but little place in the dietary of the poor; and even in the house of the well-to-do peasant butcher meat appears but seldom. According to Dr Raseri, who has investigated the point by means of the customs returns and similar statistics, Sardinia is the region where animal food is most largely employed, and Sicily that where it is least.

Wine is naturally the prevailing drink throughout the country; but the extent of the consumption varies greatly from region to region, the average in the Roman province, Umbria, and Sardinia much exceeding that in the provinces of Naples and in Sicily. Tħc use of alcohol is greatest in the Lombardo-Venetian cities; and it is there only that beer is of importance as a beverage. Cases of accidental death and of insanity attributable to the misuse of stimulants are much more frequent in the north than in the south or centre, andin both respects Liguria has an unenviable pre-eminence.

An idea of the extent to which even the peasantry are oppressed by penury may be obtained from the investigations made by the Government into the spread of the terrible disease known as the pellagra. First clearly described as an Italian disease by Frapolli in 1771, the pellagra has within the present century gradually’ become more common and severe. In 1839 it was estimated that the number of pellagra patients was 20,282 in the “compartment of Lombardy, and in 1856 it had increased to 38,777. According to [9:13:456] returns tor 1879 it appears that there were 97,855 patients in the kingdom—by far the greater proportion being in Lombardy, the Veneto, and Emilia, where they actually formed 31’70, 30'52, and 23'66 per thousand of the agricultural population. The disease has many forms, and not unfrequently ends in insanity. And to what are its ravages to be ascribed? To insufficient and unwholesome food, and more particularly to the use of maize in a state unfit for human consumption.^[19. See Annali di A<jricoltura, No. IS, “La Pellagra in Italia. 1879” (Rome. 1880). The statistics of the hospital of St Clements at Venice, for example, are sufficiently startling, as indicating the extent of what the Italians graphically call il delirio della miseria. The first column gives the number of the lunatics received in each year, the second column those whose mental condition is the result of the pellagra, that is, of poverty. [table] Tlιe to al number of pellagra lunatics in Italy, which in 1874 was 945, had increased by 1877 to 1348.] When such a state of matters exists among the rural population of some of the most prosperous regions of the country, there is little wonder that the number of conscripts who have to be rejected on the score of physical incapacity is a large one—20 per cent, in Lombardy and 18 per cent, in the Veneto in 1878.^[20. Compare Laveleye, L' Italie actuelle, Loud., 1880.]

The interest of the Italians is gradually being aroused in the sanitary condition of their cities and towns. Many of the provincial capitals and cathedral cities are portentously filthy. Drainage and sewage works, however, are becoming matters of concern to a number of the more important communes; and such cities more especially as Naples and Catania are bestowing much attentif n on the subject. A society of public health, Società Italiana cl’ igicne, was established at Milan, one of the most advanced of Italian cities, in 1877; it publishes a valuable journal.^[21. Compare the accounts given by Gallenga in his Italy Revisited.] In Milan, Bologna, Genoa, Rome, and some other cities attention is being paid to the question of cheap houses for the working classes. On the general health conditions of Italy compare the elaborate study by Giuseppe Sormani, Geografin nosologica dell’ Italia, Rome, 1881.

Commerce. — The extent of its coast and the number and excellence of its ports and harbours, the relation which it holds to the other countries of the Mediterranean seaboard, and the railway communication which it now possesses with the Transalpine lands combine to give Italy an important place as a trading-country,—a place which would have been more important if all departments of activity had not fallen into so sad a state during the long period of its political decadence. In a country with a population comparatively so dense, and with so large a number of considerable cities as we have seen Italy to possess, it is evident on the face of it that the internal trade must amount to no small aggregate; but the simple agricultural life which is led by a large proportion of the inhabitants, the capacity which many regions possess of satisfying the demands of local consumption, limited at once in volume and variety, and the lack in many cases of free and frequent means of communication tend to restrain the scope and complexity of this interchange. That both the internal trade and the foreign commerce of Italy are in process of rapid development it is impossible to doubt. Of the former movement some idea may be obtained from the railway statistics, which, however, owing to the incompleteness of the system, furni; h a less accurate representation of the facts than similar statistics in the case of older nations. That the foreign commerce is on the increase is shown by the following statement of the exports, imports, and transit trade from 1871 to 1880 (Table XX.):—
[table]

“1111873,” says Dr A. Brunialti, the author of “Le grandi vie del commercio intemazionale,” published in Studij sulla Geografin dell’ Italia (Florence, 1875), issued by the Italian Geographical Society, “Italy, with a total of 2,400,000,000 lire, was eighth in the list of commercial nations of Europe, being exceeded by Great Britain (17,000,000,000 lire), Germany, France,Russia,Belgium, Austria, and Holland, though Belgium is less than one-tenth of Italy in area, and has not more than one-fifth of its population, and Holland is not much bigger than Belgium, and has one-third less of a population.” In 1877 it was still eighth on the list, and some of the smaller countries had made greater advance. The Italian trade with France and with Switzerland has enormously increased since the unification of the kingdom; and the same may be said of the trade with Russia. Since the opening of the Suez Canal advantage has been taken of the new opportunities of trade with the East.

Table XXL gives the geographical distribution of the Italian trade during 1869, 1873, and 1879. In 1880 the whole value of the imports (excluding transit trade) was 1,225,644,170 lire, and the corresponding number for the exports 1,132,289,192.

The Italian exports, as a natural consequence of the undeveloped state of the industries and the preponderance of its agriculture, mainly consist of such products as wine, oil, fruit, cattle, &c.
[table]
[table]
[9:13:457]

Table XXII. shows the great increase that has taken place in the amounts exported in the case of several important articles.

Among the chief imports is coal, the demand for which, in 1865 only 456,039 tons,^[22. ton (tonn*llata) = 2200 lb,—40 lb less than the English ton.] has gradually increased to 1,523,676 in 1879, and to 1,737,746 in 1880—more than threefold. The importation of mineral oils has in the same space increased in value from 83,981 quintals to 586,323. Whereas the excess of importation over exportation in the case of raw wool was 4,249,135 kilogrammes in 1865, in 1880 it was 5,574,700 kilogrammes; in the case of cotton the corresponding figures were 3,745,009 for 1865 and 29,158,500 for 1880.

According to the Relazione sui Servizi idraulici pel biennio 1877-78 (Rome, 1880), the number of ports in the kingdom is 307, of which 10 are of the first class, 20 of the second, 27 of the third, and 250 of the fourth. Those belonging to the first category are Ancona, Cagliari, Naples, Palermo, Venice, Genoa, Leghorn, Messina, Civita Vecchia, and Brindisi; and those of the second include Portofino, Porto Venere, Porto Ferraio, Porto Ercole, Marciano, Porto d’Anzio, Gaeta, Ponza, Baia, Manfredonia, Tortoli, Milazzo, Cotrone, Syracuse, Longone, Nisida. In extent of commerce Genoa is facile princeps, as is evident from the following table (XXIII.) of tonnage, according to the official Movimento della, Naνigazi6nc (Rome, 1880):—
[table]

Of the foreign nations that are engaged in the shipping trade of the Italian ports Great Britain has by far the most important share (7669 vessels, of 5,950,279 tons burden); next comes France (4256 vessels, 2,061,973 tons); third, but at an enormous distance, is Austria, and fourth Greece. It is calculated that in the vessels, native and foreign, that visited the Italian ports in 1879, no less than 1,748,717 men were engaged as seamen.

The Government undertakes the engineering works necessary for the improvement and maintenance of the harbours of the first three classes, and it further subsidizes the communes which have to maintain the harbours of the fourth class. In 1878 there were 60 lighthouses on the Italian coast, of which 16 are of the first class, exclusive of the international light at Cape Spartivento. The whole cost of harbour and lighthouse maintenance is thus indicated (in lire) for 1877 and 1878 (Table XXIV.):—
[table]

The Italian seaboard is officially divided into 23 maritime districts (compart menti) :—Porto Maurizio (from Ventimiglia to Alassio), Savona (onwards to Arenzano), Genoa (to Rapallo), Spezia (to Avenza), Leghorn (to Graticciare), Porto Ferraio (island of Elba), Civita Vecchia (from Graticciare to Torre Gregoriana), Gaeta (to Lago di Patria), Naples (to Torre del Greco), Castellamare diStabia (to Sapri), Pizzo (to Bagnara), Taranto (from Melito to Fasano), Bari (to Viesti), Ancona (to mouth of Cesano), Rimini (to Po di Goro), Venice (to the Austrian boundary), Cagliari (from Oristano to Terranuova Pausania), La Maddalena (to Oristano), Messina (continental Italy from Bagnara to Melito, the Lipari Islands, and Sicily from the river Pollina to Alcantara), Catania (to Pachino), Porto Empedocle (to river Belici), Trapani (to Castellamare),
[table]

Palermo (to river Pollina). Thus 15 of the districts are continental and 8 insular.

Table XXV. gives the sailing vessels in the mercantile marine in 1879, the last year for which statistics are available.

The marine showed a total strength of 167,282 men,—8 being captains of the class technically called “superior,” 4122 captains of “long course,” and 2504 captains of the higher coasting class.

Of the 7910 vessels none exceeded 1500 tons burden, 2 were more than 1200, and 18 others more than 1000. The steamers belonging to the country at the close of 1879 were 151 in number (aggregate burden 72,666 tons), of which 70 were Genoese, 11 Neapolitan, and 51 Palermitan. Of the total, 128 were screwsteamers and 23 paddle-steamers. Boats adapted for fishing were registered at the same date as 15,411, of which no fewer than 1953 belonged to the Naples district, and 1399 to that of Messina. Shipbuilding was carried on in 50 ship yards in 1879; and they produced 269 vessels, with a total burden of 21,213 tons.

Shipbuilding. — The district which showed the greatest activity in shipbuilding and produced the greatest number of large vessels was that of Genoa. This industry continued to increase in importance in Italy from the foundation of the kingdom till 1869 (683 vessels, 96,010 tons); in the next three years there was a decline; by 1875 the figures of 1869 were again almost reached, but since then there has been a very notable decrease. The number of workmen engaged in 1879 was 14,179, of whom 182 were shipbuilders of the first and 70 of the second class.

Railways. — The first railway opened in Italy was a line of 26 kilometres, constructed in 1840, between Naples and Castellamare. By 1842 there were 54 kilometres in existence; by 1845, 157; by 1848, 360; by 1858, 1707; by 1868, 5679; and by 1879, 8340. The system is considered as consisting of the following sections (Table XXVI.):—
[table]

Thus the total cost may be stated at £100,800,000. At the end of 1879 the rolling stock consisted of 1385 locomotives, 4301 carriages, and 23,483 waggons. The total expenditure of the railways for the year 1879 was 101,088,901 lire, and the total receipts 164,672,340.

Except in the northern part of the country the Italian railway system is still far from complete. With the French system it is connected by the coast-line from Genoa to Nice, and by the line from Turin to Geneva, which passes through the Mont Cenis tunnel. With the Austrian system there is connexion by the line which runs up the valley of the Adige from Verona to Botzen and by the lines which cross the eastern frontiers at Pontebba and Cormons respectively. From Milan to Piacenza, from Piacenza to Bologna, from Bologna to Ancona, and from Ancona to Brindisi, there is free route from the north right along the eastern coast; but the lines on the western coast take the traveller no farther south than a little beyond Salerno, and to reach Reggio from Naples involves a tremendous circuit. *By the law of July 29, 1879, a great number of new lines received parliamentary sanction, the effect of which will be to complete the western coast-line, to increase the number of routes from the western to the eastern seaboard, and to furnish railway communication to numerous cities and districts which are now without it.

Roads and Canals.— It was found that on 31st December 1877 there existed in the kingdom 5151 miles of national reads, 15,596 of provincial roads, and 48,295 of communal roads—all very unequally distributed throughout the country. The navigable canals have an aggregate length of about 663 miles, and the navigable portions of the rivers an aggregate length of 1100.

Postal and Telegraphic System.— The rate of development attained by the postal system is shown by the following figures. From 1862 to 1879 (both inclusive) the number of offices has increased from 2220 to 3272, the number of letters from 71,502,779 per annum to 143,587,709, the yearly expenditure from 21,740,226 lire to [9:13:458] 26,659,071, and the yearly revenue from 11,944,797 lire to 26,998,784. There was a deficit in each of the six years 1862- 1868; since then there has always been at least a slight surplus. Post-office savings banks were introduced by the law of 1875. In the first year 1989 offices were opened, and the amount of the deposits was 3,709,357 lire. In 1879 the offices numbered 3259, and the deposits amounted to 33,564,370 lire.

The telegraphic system took its beginning in Italy in 1861 By the end of 1866 the lines had reached an aggregate length of 14,000 kilometres, and a wire-development of 38,000; and by the close of 1879 the corresponding figures were 25,533 and 84,101 kilometres. The country was thus, if the ratio of the lines to the area be considered, a long way in advance of Spain and Hungary, but considerably behind the other chief states of Europe. The following are the submarine cables belonging to the state :— Bagnara-Torre di Faro (dating from 1876); Carmitello-Ganzirri, uniting Sicily and Calabria; Otranto-Valona (dating from 1863); Pozzuoli-Procida; Procida-Ischia; Sardinia-Carloforte; Sardinia-Isola della Maddalena; Piombino-Elba; Venice-Chioggia. France maintains a cable between Corsica and Leghorn, and between Corsica and Sardinia; the Mediterranean Extension Company keeps up communication between Sicily and Malta, and between Otranto and Corfu, and the Eastern Telegraph Company has lines between Calabria and Sicily, Orbetello and Sardinia, and Otranto and Alexandria (via Zante and Crete). The number of telegraph offices in 1879, Government and private, was 2480. The number of telegrams despatched in 1877 and 1879 was as follows (Table XXVII.):—
[table]

The net gain of the telegraph department in 1879 was 1,182,814 lire, an increase of 413,348 lire on the gain of the previous year.

Army and Navy.— By the law of 7th June 1875, all men capable of bearing arms are under obligation of military service from their twenty-first to the end of their thirty-ninth year. They are divided into three categories: the first and second consist of those who are to serve successively in the standing army {Esercito permanente), in the mobile {Milizia mobile, equivalent to the Prussian Landwehr), and in the territorial militia {Milizia territoriale, equivalent to Prussian Landsturm')·, the third serve in the territorial militia only. The men of the first category, that is, those who draw the first numbers in the conscription, serve eight or nine years in the regular standing army, four or five years in the mobile, and seven years in the militia, or, in the case of the cavalry, nine years in the regular army and ten in the militia,—the infantry spending three years and the cavalry five years under· arms, and for the rest of their time forming the active reserve. The men of the second category, that is, those who do not draw the first figures at the conscription, serve five or six years in the regular army, four or three years in the mobile, and the remainder of their term in the militia. They only require to be in arms for five months, and these months may be distributed over several years.^[23. For further information see Army (vol. ii. p. 612)⅛ and H. v. I.δbelle, Jahresberichte über die Veränderungen irn Militäriftsen.]

Those conscripts who pass a certain examination and pay 1500 lire (in the cavalry 2000) are required to spend only one year with their regiments, and are further permitted, like the university students, to put off their year of service till they are twenty-six years of age.

The following table (XXVIII.) gives the general strength of the army at September 30 in nine successive years :—
[table]

By the law of 15th May 1877 the country is divided into ten army corps districts, the seats of which are Verona, Milan, Turin, Piacenza, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Naples, Bari, and Palermo. These are broken up into twenty military divisions, one half of which are centred in the cities just mentioned and the other half in Padua, Brescia, Genoa, Ancona, Perugia, Salerno, Chieti, Catanzaro, Messina. The military districts, which have an important share in the mobilization of the army, number eighty-eight.

The following table (XXIX.) indicates the strength of the various arms in October 1879 :—
[table]

The army cost the country between 1871 and 1875 the sum of 882,471,512 lire, or in round nunιbers £7,060,000 per annum, and the navy 171,188,531 lire, or £1,369,500 per annum. The following figures (Table XXX.) indicate the expenses, ordinary and extraordinary, since incurred (in millions of lire) :—
[table]

The annual cost of the Italian army is slight as compared with that incurred by other countries; but compared with the resources of Italy it wears a totally different aspect.

For navy organization the coast regions are divided into three departments (Spezia, Naples, and Venice) and twenty-two conscription districts. About 16,000 or 18,000 men are enrolled yearly, and 18,000 have unlimited furlough. On January 1, 1880, the national fleet consisted of the following vessels (Table XXXI.) ;—
[table]

The personnel of the fleet was thus composed Officers— 1 admiral, 4 vice-admirals, 9 rear-admirals, 36 capitani di vas-cello, 42 capitani di fregata, 202 lieutenants, 150 sub-lieutenants, 49 officers of the naval engineers, 24 assistants, 78 officers of the mechanicians, 117 officers of the sanitary corps, 235 officers of the commissariat department, and 540 civil employés; Men— 15,055, including 7878 sailors proper and 2162 gunners. The greatest of the naval establishments in the kingdom is that of Spezia, which was opened about 1876, instead of the similar establishment at Genoa. The arsenal in 1879 had an area measuring 3930 feet in length by 2450 in breadth. Two other arsenals are maintained at Naples and Venice respectively. The workmen employed in the various establishments numbered 6292 in 1879.

Religion.— The Roman Catholic Church claims the great mass of the Italian population; but, besides the ordinary Latin rite, several others are recognized in the country. The Armenians of Venice maintain their traditional characteristics. The Albanians of the southern provinces still employ the Greek rite and the Greek language in their public worship, and their priests, like those of the Greek Church, are allowed to marry. And certain peculiarities introduced by St Ambrose distinguish the ritual of Milan from that of the general church. Up to 1871 the island of Sicily was, according to the bull of Urban II., ecclesiastically dependent on the king, and exempt from the canonical power of the pope.

Though the territorial authority of the papal see was abolished in 1870, the fact that Italy, and Rome more particularly, is the seat of the administrative centre of the vast organization of the church is not without significance to the nation. In the same city in which the administrative functions of the body politic are centralized there still exists the court of the spiritual potentate with a total personnel (in 1879) of 1821 souls.

The number of episcopal dioceses in Italy is 265; but as it sometimes happens that more than one io subject to the same bishop, the number of these functionaries is somewhat less. Every diocese has full individuality as a corporation, and possesses a cathedral with a chapter of canons, a number of minor benefices, and a seminary. The number of canons before the law of 1867 was 4699. Including the so-called patriarch of Venice, there are thirty-seven metropolitans who have jurisdiction not only over their own immediate dioceses, but [9:13:459] also over dioceses administered by suffragan bishops. Their position is indicated in the following table (XXXIL):—
[table]

Eleven archbishops and sixty-three bishops are independent of all metropolitan supervision, and hold directly of the Holy See. The archbishops are those of Amalfi, Aquila, Camerino, Catania, Cosenza, Ferrara, Gaeta, Lucca, Rossano, Spoleto, and Udine, and the bishops those of Acireale, Acquapendente, Alatri, Amelia, Anagni, Ancona-Umana, Aquino-Sora-Pontecorvo, Arezzo, Ascoli, Assisi, Aversa, P>agnorea, Borgo San Donino, Cava-Sarno, Città di Castello, Città della Pieve, Cività Castellana-Orte-Gallese, Coπιeto-Civita Vecchia, Cortona, Fabriano-Matelica, Fano, Ferentino, Foggia, Foligno, Gravina-Montepeloso, Gubbio, Jesi, Luni-Sarzana, S. Marco-Visig-nano, Marsi (Pescina), Melfi-Rapolla, Mileto, Molfetta-Terlizzi-Giovennazzo, Monopoli, Montalcino, Montefiascone, Montepulciano, Nardo, Narni, Nocera in Umbria, Noreia, Orvieto, Osimo-Cingoli, Parma, Penne-Atri, Perugia, Piacenza, Poggio Mirteto, Recanati-Loreto, Rieti, Segni, Sutri-Nepi, Teramo, Terni, Terracina-Piperno-Sezze, Tivoli, Todi, Treia (Camerino), Tri vento, Troia, Valva-Sulnιona, Veroli, Viterbo-Toscanella.

There are 24,980 parishes in the kingdom, and the parish priest has a considerable influence in the country districts, though since 1866 he can no longer act as a state official. About 800,000 lire are spent annually by the Fondo pel Culto in augmentation of the parochial stipends. The parishes vary greatly both in size and population, some having as many as 14,000 inhabitants, and others less than 100. The priest in the country has a glebe or podere which he cultivates like any of the lesser landholders of his district; and he is thus interested in the state of the markets, the character of the harvest, and the general condition of affairs.

As in every diocese there is a seminary or diocesan school, the number of such institutions exceeds that of the royal, provincial, and communal lyceums (7tcez - ) and gymnasiums {ginnasi). In so far as they concern themselves with secular education, they are subject to the supervision of the minister of instruction. At the time of the inspection of 1877—78 they were found to have 17,478 pupils, of whom only 3547 were studying theology.

The only Protestant denomination with a true historical position in Italy is that of the Waldensians, which has taken advantage of the religious liberty of the new kingdom to come down from the mountain fastnesses. Besides the sixteen churches (with 11,958 members in 1879) which it possessed at the time of its recognition by law in the kingdom of Sardinia in 1848, it numbers thirty-nine churches and thirty-two mission stations scattered throughout the country as far south as Sicily; and it maintains between twenty and thirty elementary schools. The ‘-Free Italian Church,” founded in 187Ö by twenty-three churches which declared themselves independent of the Waldensian organization, consisted in 1879 of thirty-six churches and thirty-five stations; and since 1876 it has a theological college in Rome. Ina number of the larger cities of N orthern and Central Italy there are considerable congregations of the “Free Christian Church,” a community or “brotherhood” which believes that stated ministers and church statistics are both un-Christian. The Wesleyan Meth odist Church, having carried on evangelizing operations in Italy since 1861, has forty-three churches and stations with about 1306 communicants, and in its elementary schools 776 scholars. Of less extent are the more modera attainments of the American Episcopal Methodists, the American Baptists, and the English Baptists. Several orphanages, refuges, and schools of special purpose owe their existence to Protestant benevolence. Compare Giorgio Curcio, “Progamma per una statistica dei culti in Italia,” in Annali di Stat. i 1880.

Religious Foundations.— As far back as 1855 an Act was passed in the Sardinian states for the disestablishment of all houses of the religious orders not engaged in preaching, teaching, or the care of the sick, of all chapters of collegiate churches not having a cure of souls or existing in towns of less than 20,000 inhabitants, and of all private benefices for which no service was paid by the holders. The property and money thus obtained were used to form an ecclesiastical fund {Cassa Ecclesiastica) distinct from the finances of the state. This Act resulted in the suppression cf 274 monasteries with 3733 friars, of 61 nunneries with 1756 nuns, and of 2722 chapters and benefices. In 1860 and 1861 the royal commissioners (even before the constitution of the new kingdom of Italy had been formally declared) issued decrees by which there were abolished—(1) in Umbria, 197 monasteries and 102 convents with 1809 male and 2393 female associates, and 836 chapters or benefices; (2) in the Marches, 292 monasteries and 127 convents with 2950 male and 2728 female associates; (3) in the Neapolitan provinces, 747 monasteries and 275 convents with 8787 male and 7493 female associates. There were thus disestablished in the space of seyen or eight years 2075 houses of the regular clergy occupied by 31,649 persons; and the confiscated property 7 yielded a revenue of 9,957,457 lire, or £398,298. And at the same time there had been suppressed 11,889 chapters and benefices of the secular clergy, which yielded an annual income of 4,978,728 lire, or £199,149. The value of the capital thus potentially freed from the dead hand was estimated at £12,000,000; though hitherto the ecclesiastical possessions in Lombardy, Emilia, Tuscany, and Sicily had been left untouched. As yet the Cassa Ecclesiastica had no right to dispose of the property thus entrusted to it; but in 1862 an Act was passed by which it transferred all its real property {bcni stabili or immobili) to the national domain, and was credited with a corresponding amount by the exchequer. The property could now be disposed of like the other property of the domain; and except in Sicily, where the system of emphyteusis was adopted, the church lands began to be sold by auction. In order to encourage the poorer classes of the people to become landholders, it was decided that the lots offered for sale should be small, and that the purchaser should be allowed to pay by five or ten yearly instalments. By a new Act in 1866 the process of secularization was extended to the whole kingdom. All the members of the suppressed communities received full exercise of all the ordinary political and civil rights of laymen; and annuities were granted to all those who had taken permanent religious vows prior to 18th January 1864. To priests and choristers, for example, of the proprietary or endowed orders were assigned 600 lire per annum if they were upwards of sixty years of age, 400 if upwards of 40, and 360 if younger. The Cassa Ecclesiastica was abolished, and in its stead was instituted a Fondo pel Cullo, or public worship fund, attached to the department of grace and justice, and administered by a director and a council consisting of three senators, three deputies, and three nominees of the king. From the general confiscation were exempted the buildings actually used for public worship, as episcopal residences or seminaries, &c., or which had been appropriated to the use of schools, poorhouses, hospitals, &c., by the communes and provinces in keeping with the acts of 1861 and 1864; as well as the buildings, appurtenances, and movable property of the abbeys of Monte Casino, Della Cava dei TirrenifSan Martino della Scala, Monreale, Certosa near Pavia, and other establishments of the same kind of importance as architectural or historical monuments. An annuity equal to the ascertained revenue of the suppressed institutions was placed to the credit of the fund in the Government 5 per cent, consols. A fourth of this sum was tobe handed over to the communes to be employed on works of beneficence or education as soon as a surplus was obtained from that part of the annuity assigned for the payment of monastic pensions; and in Sicily, indeed, 209 communes entered on their privileges as soon as the patrimony was liquidated. Another Act following on August 15, 1867, decreed the suppression of certain foundations which had escaped the action of previous measures, put an extraordinary tax of 30 per .cent, on the whole of the patrimony 7 of the chureh, and granted the Government the right of issuing 5 per cent, bonds sufficient to bring into the treasury 400,000,000 lire, which were to be accept«! at their nominal value as purchase [9:13:460] money for the alienated property. The result of the whole legislation from 1855 to 1867 was the abrogation of nearly 50,000 ecclesiastical foundations which were rendering almost no service to the country beyond that of supporting an idle population of more than 60,000 souls. The following figures (Table XXXIII.) summarize the chief facts of the suppression :—
[table]

The total of the real property taken over by the domain up to 31st December 1877 may be estimated as yielding an aggregate revenue of 30,969,465 lire or £1,238,778 and possessing a capital value of 839,776,076 lire or £33,910,430. Of the latter sum 530,649,932 lire represent the property disposed of for the benefit of the state, 75,542,813 the property granted in emphyteusis, &c., 8,098,294 the property handed over to Government for administrative purposes, 125,191,797 the property transferred to lawful claimants, and 100,293,200 the property not yet alienated. The Fondo pel Culto derives its income from four different sources:—(1) as already indicated, from the public funds; (2) from the buildings still occupied by the ex-monks, &c., and other property not transferred to the domain; (3) from rents, ground-annuals, livelli, tithes, and other annual dues; (4) from contributions exacted from the revenues of ecclesiastical foundations still maintained. The third source is especially valuable, yielding in 1876, for example, 13,984,000 lire, and being capable of considerable augmentation under judicious management. The total expenditure of the fund during the ten years from the institution of the same to the close of 1876 amounted to 278,399,592 lire or £11,135,983, distributed as follows (Table XXX1V.)
[table]

The heaviest of these items is one that is gradually diminishing, and will finally become extinct, by the dying out of the pensioners. On the 31st of December· 1876 the deficit of the fund was 48,312,686 lire or £1,932,507,—650,180 lire having been the deficit taken over from the Cassa Ecclesiastica. By 1879 the debt was reduced to 1,688,719 lire.

Hitherto only a passing allusion has been made to the legislation relating to the Roman territory acquired after the passing of the Acts above indicated. In the province as distinguished from the city the only thing requisite was to make the existing measures applicable, but in the case of the city and the suburban districts special enactments had to be provided. According to the census of 1871 there were in the city and province of Rome 474 monastic establishments (311 for monks, 163 for nuns), occupied by 4326 monks and 3825 nuns, and possessing a gross revenue of 4,780,891 lire. - Of these, 126 monasteries and 90 convents were situated in the city, 51 monasteries and 22 convents in the “suburbicariates.” The action of the law of June 19th 1873 has left untouched 23 of the monasteries and 49 of the convents, which had either the character of private institutions, or were supported by foreign funds. In the city alone 2977 individuals became recipients of pensions from the fund to the aggregate value of 1,319,832 lire.

Table XXXV. furnishes details regarding the suppression and modification of ecclesiastical foundations.

For further information, see G. C. Bertozzi, “Notizie stoιiche e statistiche sul riordinamento dell’ asse ecclesiastico nel regno d’Italia,” in Annali di Stat., 1879; and the summary of the same by Bellini in the Archivio di Stat., 1880.

Education.— In the matter of education the kingdom of Italy at the time of its formation might almost be described as a desert, broken every here and there by an oasis of matchless fertility and luxuriance. The learning of the learned was high, and the ignorance of the ignorant profound. As late as the census of 1861 it was found that in a population of 21,777,331 there were no less than 16,999,701 “analphabètes,” or persons absolutely destitute of instruction, absolutely unable to read. Of children between five and twelve as many as 82 per cent, were in this condition; of those between twelve and nineteen 71 per cent. And, as was natural, the ignorance was greater in the female sex than in the male: while 59 per cent, of the men married in 1866 were obliged to make their mark, 78 per cent, of the women were in like case. In certain parts of the country matters were even worse. Μ. Natoli found, c.g., that in the Basilicata the illiterate class comprised 912 out of every 1000 inhabitants. It was thus no light task that presented itself to the department of education; and the progress that has been attained does honour to its activity: in 1879 only 48 per cent, of the bridegrooms and 70 per cent, of the brides were unable to sign their names.

The administration of the education department is not so strictly centralized as it is in France. The minister of public instruction is assisted by a permanent council of fourteen ordinary and seven extraordinary members nominated by the king and chosen from the upper ranks of the educational profession. And this council has no mere nominal existence; it meets regularly thrice a week, though it often contains men of European celebrity. Five of its members, selected by the king, constitute a fine arts commission. Another general council — the Proυcditorato Centrale — established in 1867, has special control of secondary and primary instruction. In each of the sixty-nine provinces there is a consiglio scolastico or school board, under the presidency of the prefect, which has the right of supervision in regard to the sanitary and moral state of the provincial schools, private as well as public. By the law of 1859 (known as the Casati Act) every commune of 4000 inhabitants is bound to maintain a primary school; but as a matter of fact some of the communes are too small and poor to have a school of their own, and are permitted to send their children to the schools of neighbouring communes. Elementary instruction is gratuitous, and by the law of 15th July 1877 the compulsory principle was brought into operation as far as the condition of the communes allows—Or, in other words, in all communes of less than 5000 inhabitants provided with one teacher for every 1000, in all communes of from 10O0 to 12,000 inhabitants provided with a teacher for every 1200, and in all the larger communes with one for every 1500. According to the report published
[table]
[9:13:461]

in 1878 by the minister of public instruction on the effects of the law, Northern Italy was in the most favourable condition, having a much greater proportion of communes than either Central or Southern Italy. While in the north only 383,916 inhabitants— scattered in little groups through the mountainous districts—were unable to make use of the existing means of instruction, in Central Italy this was found to be the case with 1,230,599 (out of a total population of 6⅛ millions); and matters were still worse in the south. In the central regions 498 of the 1235 communes were unable to enforce the law through lack of the legal number of teachers, and in the southern provinces it would have been requisite to increase the teaching staff by 1536. The following statistics indicate the extent of the organization for primary instruction in 1879 ι^[24. In the Italian statistics scuola means rather class than school.] — (1) Asylums for children (infant schools)^[25. There is no statement of the number of these asylums or schools.] —pupils, 183,809 (92,905 boys, 90,904 girls); teachers, 3752. (2) Elementary schools: public 35,171 (890,080 boys, 708,227 girls); private 6476 (53,479 boys, 80,416 girls). (3) Evening Classes for adults·. 11,161 for men, 472 for women; pupils—439,∙624 males, 16,063 females, (4) Sunday schools {scuole festive)·. 592 for men, 5979 for women; pupils—5977 males, 21,194 females.

Most of the institutions known as asili infantili, or infant asylums, are after the Aporti method— -forse, says an Italian critic, un poco troppo scuola e tropρo poco asilo ; but a certain number are conducted on FroebeΓs kindergarten system, which was introduced among the Italians by the baroness Marienholtz-Bulow and George P. Marsh the American minister. The principal institutions for secondary education are the gymnasiums and the lyceums. The former have a course of five years, and the instruction comprises Greek, Latin, Italian, history, geography, and arithmetic; the latter, with a three years course, add to those subjects philosophy, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and natural history. There are seven masters or “professors” in each lyceum. The pupils entering the lyceum are usually from fourteen to fifteen years of age; they are only admitted on presenting a satisfactory gymnasial certificate. According to a pleasant custom, the lyceum usually bears the name of some person of national and at the same time local celebrity—as the Leopardi lyceum at Macerata. As the gymnasiums and lyceums are too exclusively devoted to what is known as classical education satisfactorily to subserve the necessities of modern life, they have been supplemented by a very considerable number of technical schools, the earliest of which in Italy dates as far back as 1848. No fewer than 43 trade schools were subsidized by the minister of instruction in 1878-79. Most of the secondary education institutions were intended for boys. In 1861 the municipality of Milan founded a “high school” for girls, and their example has met with very commendable imitation. A variety of establishments for female education were of course in existence throughout the country at a much earlier date, but they were organized on the basis for the most part of old-fashioned ideas in regard to what was appropriate for women. Such are the so-called conser-vatorii of Tuscany—which were originally purely religious foundations, and only partially secularized by Leopold I.—and the St Mary colleges of Sicily, which have occasioned so much controversy as to whether they are educational or charitable institutions. The Government lyceums and gymnasiums had 18,021 pupils in 1879, the other public lyceums and gymnasiums 11,779, lyceums and gymnasiums attached to the seminaries 11,650, and private lyceums and gymnasiums 7139—making a total of 48,589.

For the higher education Italy possesses no fewer than seventeen national universities. They are all of more or less ancient date, except that of Rome, which was opened in 1870, and it is a respect for this antiquity which is in some cases the chief cause of their preservation. That several of them are of comparatively small importance is shown by the following figures, exhibiting the number of students or hearers of lectures for the year 1879 :—Naples had 2817, Turin 1509, Padua 948, Pavia 672, Rome 648, Pisa 586, Bologna 569, Genoa 480, Palermo 449, Modena 195, Parma 194, Siena 181, Catania 168, Messina 128, Cagliari 95, Sassari 93, Macerata 82. Besides the seventeen establishments there are four free universities, those of Perιιgia and Ferrara with three faculties each, and those of Camerino and Urbino with two faculties. They are all small,—the students for 1879 numbering 65 in Perugia, 60 in Urbino, 46 in Feιτara, and 43 in Camerino. Theology has ceased to be a subject of instruction in the national universities. In 1876-77 there were 3314 students in the faculty of jurisprudence, 2842 in that of medicine, 1257 in that of the mathematical sciences, and 212 in that of philosophy and letters. The university teaching staff consists of ordinary professors, extraordinary professors, and free professors, the last corresponding to the “Privat - docenten” of Germany. A certificate of attendance at a lyceum is requisite for admission as a university student, and candidates are further subjected to a preliminary examination.

Among the institutions which cooperate with the universities it is sufficient to mention the institute for the higher studies and the school of the social sciences at Florence, the scientific and literary academy of Milan, the upper technical institute of Milan, the engineering schools at Naples, Rome, and Turin, the veterinary colleges at Milan, Naples, and Turin, the royal school of commerce at Venice, the royal school of medicine and surgery at Naples. As an indication of the extent to which such a list might be carried, we may take the department of agricultural training. Here we have agrarian institutes and farming colleges at Rome (1872), Castelletti near Signi (1864), Motrone in the province of Lucca (1874), Macerata (1868), Cosenza (1870), Grumello del Monte near Bergamo, Brescia (1876), Brasegnane near Padua (1872), Pesaro (1876), Palermo (1819), Caltagirone (1868), Brindisi (1872), Lecce (refounded 1879), &c.; and many of these establishments have considerable pieces of land for the purpose of practical training. The Middle Calabria school of agriculture (1876) is also a school of pastorizia or shepherd craft. An Istituto forestale was started at Vallombrosa in 1869, and in the eight years (1872-1879) it has sent out eighty-three licentiates of forestry. The school of “viticulture and enology,” or vine-growing and wine-making, at Conegliano dates from 1876; it publishes a Rivista di Viticoltura. A school of zootechnia and caseificio, or the principles of cattle-breeding and cheese-making, exists at Reggio Emilia; and at Palermo there is a special school for the art of sulphur-mining.

In 1879 about 2,000,000 lire were devoted by the Government to the encouragement of art. Art schools exist at Bologna, Carrara, Florence, Lucca, Massa, Milan, Modena, Naples, Parma, Ravenna, Rome, Reggio Emilia, Turin, Urbino, Venice; and the number of pupils has increased from about 3000 in 1862 to 5000 in 1879. Besides these fifteen official establishments, of which that of Milan—with a maximum of 1491 pupils—is by far the largest, there are academies at Genoa, Bergamo, Verona, Siena, Pisa, and Perugia. A Museo Tiberino has been established by the commission charged to superintend the exploration of the Tiber. Five musical conservatorios are supported by Government at Florence, Milan, Naples, Palermo, and Parma.

Next to the difficulty of arousing the interest of the mass of the people in matters of education, so as to secure the realization of the legal enactments, the greatest difficulty perhaps with which the administration has had to contend has been that of obtaining a sufficient supply of teachers competent for their task. In the normal and “magistral” schools training is provided at the national expense for candidates, whether male or female, for the teaching profession. The age for entrance is fixed at sixteen for male and fifteen for female students, and the course of study lasts for three years. In 1877-78 there were 35 normal and “magistral” schools for male and 67 for female teachers. The number of pupils was 7854 (1447 males and 6407 females).

For further information on this section see Hippeau, L' Instruction publique en Italie, Paris, 1875, and Pécaut, Deux mois demission en Italie, Paris, 1880.

The great Italian public libraries are those of Turin, Milan, Naples, Florence. Florence receives a copyright copy of all new books and new editions. The Pavia library is especially rich in works in natural science, the legacy left by Professor Frank enabling it to purchase from 1500 to 1600 new works per annum. The total number of new books added to all the state libraries, which now number 33, was in 1872 about 14,000. The readers numbered 853,901, besides 9008 teachers who got books home with them. More recent statistics show comparatively little change.

Among the philanthropic educational institutions those for the tuition of deaf-mutes deserve particular mention. It was in Italy that some of the earlier attempts were made to give instruction to this class of unfortunates; and two of its most important establishments, the royal institute of deaf-mutes at Genoa and the corresponding institute at Milan, date respectively from 1801 and 1805. From a report (Rome, 1880) which was compiled for the instruction of the second international congress of deaf-mute teachers (Milan, 1881) it appears that there are thirty-five establishments of this class, with 1491 pupils in 1880, the largest being at Milan, Bologna, Naples, Turin, and Genoa. The total number of deaf-mutes in the kingdom is estimated at nearly 12,000; and hence it is calculated that the number of pupils would require to be about 7000. Th⅛oral method is very generally em∣ Joyed in the Italian institutions,—the rich vowel-system of the Italian language giving a favourable basis of operations.

From the Strenna-Album of the Associazionc della Stampa (Rome, 1881) we learn that the number of periodicals published in Italy in 1880 was 1454, or about one to every 8000 of the reading population,—a statement that compares favourably with corresponding statistics of other countries. One paper, Gazzetta Nazionale Genovese, dates its origin as far back as 1797; all the others belong to the present century, 162 having appeared for the first time in 1876, 227 in 1877, 240 in 1878, and 246 in 1879. The total number published in 1836 was only 185, in 1857 it amounted to 311, in 1864 to 450, in 1871 to 765, and in 1875 to 914. According to the statistics of 1875, more than the half of the total number of 494 were published at Milan (104), Florence (82), Turin (68), Rome, Naples, Bologna, Palermo, and Venice. See Archivio di Statistica, 1876, fasc. 1.
[9:13:462]

Beneficence.— A first attempt to form an idea of the number and nature of the beneficent institutions of Italy was made by the Government in 1862, and the result was published in 1864 in the Calendario generate del Regno. A fuller inquiry was undertaken in 1863 by the board of statistics under the direction of Pietro Maestri, and the information was communicated to the public in 15 large volumes published between 1868 and 1872. According to this inquiry, usually called of 1861, because the data refer to the state of the institutions in that year, the total number of benevolent institutions (exclusive of the province of Pome) was 20,123 (of which 3866 were purely religious foundations), and their property was valued at1,100,932,000 lire. The amount of money annually expended by these institutions was about 86,000,000; and on an average 6,305,000, or about a fourth of the population, were recipients of their bounty in one form or other. In 1862 a law was passed by which the control of all public institutions of a charitable nature was placed in the hands of the communal authorities, and these have to appoint a charity committee to superintend the department and balance the accounts. In the case of all institutions subsidized by the state, the accounts must be presented to the minister of the interior; and to this functionary is assigned the right of dissolving or reorganizing any institution which the communal authorities report as misdirected or defective. Every institution is obliged to have a regular treasurer, with surety. During the eighteen years that the law has been in force, it has greatly improved the state of matters; but that there is much room for further improvement appears from the fact that nearly the half of their gross income is of no avail for the special purposes for which they exist.

The following details, derived from an admirable report presen ted by Signor Bodio to the international congress of beneficence in Milan, August 1880,^[26. Printed in ArchMo di Statistica, 1880, fasc. iv.] show the present extent of the opere pie, or works of piety. In 1878 there existed in the kingdom 3668 eleemosynary charities, 13 charities for prisoners, 2694 dowry charities, 15 baliatici (charities for poor nursing mothers), 239 asylums for shelter, 16 labour charities {case di lawn -θ'), 1028 foundations for the assistance of the sick in their own homes, 41 for the assistance of women in childbed in their own homes, 1139 hospitals for the sick, hospitals for chronic patients, 18 maternity hospitals, 15 lunatic asylums, 10 seaside hospitals, 508 school charities, 340 infants’ asylums, 397 collegi e retiri, 463 orphanages, 17 deaf-mute institutions, 9 blind asylums, 695 monti di ρietiι, 1965 monti frumentari (offices for furnishing grain to poor peasants in return for pledges), 30 agrarian loan funds, 102 nursling and foundling institutions, 2633 “congregations of charity,” and 1553 foundations of miscellaneous scope.^[27. It is to be observed that this list does not include those institutions which are still, like the great Cottolengo Hospital at Turin, under the direct control of their founders.] These 17,870 institutions being distributed among 5951 communes, 2431 communes have none of their own; but the advantages of the institutions are seldom confined to the special communes in which they are situated.

The following table (XXXVI.) indicates the gross and the net revenues enjoyed by the opere pie of each of the compartimenti :—
[table]

Classifying the institutions, the following results appear, the amounts being stated in thousands of lire (Table XXXVII.) :—
[table]

The following table (XXXVIII.) gives the returns for 1877 for the lunatic asylums of Italy :—
[table]

It appears that the number of asylums is deficient in the Napoletano and in Sicily and Sardinia, while of all the regions Emilia and the Marches are the best supplied. Of the institutions included in the table, some are maintained by the provinces, such as those of Cuneo, Alessandria, Bergamo, &c., others by the municipalities, others again by private individuals. Among the larger establishments are the public asylums of Genoa {Manicomio pubblicd), Milan, Aversa (819 inmates), Rome (715), Siena (791), Florence (712). Venice has separate establishments for its male and female lunatics.

The idea of establishing seaside hospitals to which patients could be taken from the inland districts for change of air has been carried into effect more extensively in Italy than in most other countries. Such institutions exist at Viareggio (since 1856), Voltri (1862), Fano (1863), Leghorn (1864), Sestri Levante (1867), Porto d’Anzio (1868), Venice (1868), Porto S. Stefano (187θ), Rimini (1870), Riccione (1871), Loano (1871), Celle (1872), Grado (1873), Palermo (1874), Pisa (Bocca d’Arno, 1876), Cagliari (1879). In many cases a very considerable number of communes have the right of sending their patients to a given hospital; that of Loano for instance receives from thirty-four communes which have committees of transmission. See Dr Gaetano Pini, “Gli ospizi marini e le scuole pei rachitici in Italia” in Atti del VI. Congresso dell' Associations medica italiana, Turin, 1877.

Administration of Justice.— Though, in the opinion of the most competent judges, Italy is still in the main free from that curse of civilized countries, a distinctly differentiated criminal class, there is hardly a country of Europe which presents from year to year such appalling tables of criminality. Leaving out of view the question of brigandage—which is of moment only in the southern provinces, where through long inertness the arm of the law had become comparatively powerless—crimes of violence are exceptionally frequent, and (to take the statistics of 1875) the number of persons undergoing punishment in a given year is in the ratio of 175’51 for every 100,000 inhabitants. In proportion to population there are four times as many persons condemned to death or penal servitude for life as in France, twice as many to hard labour, five times as many to solitary confinement. And it cannot be said that that part of the administration whose duty it is to deal with this multitude of lawbreakers is in a state of competent efficiency. Trial by jury is in force, but there seems good reason to question the fitness of a large part of th population for the exercise of the functions thus devolved upon them. “Not guilty with extenuating circumstances” is an amusing but suggestive verdict. Though according to the law of 1865 there is only to be one court of cassation in the country, as an actual fact there are five, as follows (Table XXXIX.) :—
[table]

The Roman court of cassation was instituted only in 1876,—the Roman court of appeal having previously been dependent on Florence, and those of Ancona-Macerata, Bologna, and Cagliari on Turin. The number of courts of assize varies from year to year, according to royal decree: in 1874 there were 86, in 1876, 92. Of civil and correctional tribunals there are 162, and of “praetors” 1813. The praetors are both civil and criminal judges; in the civil department they can decide in all cases involving less than 1500 lire. It is considered part of their duty to endeavour to bring litigants tc∙ terms without proceeding to formal trial; and, that this desirable object may be more frequently secured, a special class of judges or arbitrators, known as conciliatori—of ancient establishment in the Neapolitan provinces—was rendered common to all Italy at the legislative unification of 1865. At the request of parties in dispute, they may deal with cases involving any amount, but their decisions are final only as far as 30 lire, and they have no control—any more than the praetors—of questions affecting the taxes. The value of this class of functionaries is evident from the fact that in 1875, for example, about 25 per cent, of the cases presented[9:13:463] to the conciliators or to the praetors exercising concilia-torial functions were settled by compromise, and out of 769,533 cases 580,066 received definitive sentence.

The “establishments of detention” are of three kinds those of preventive detention, or judiciary prisons; those of penal detention, for culprits of full age∙^ and those of correction, or reformatories for prisoners under age. The following table (XL.) gives details for 1879 (the third column of figures giving the number of prisoners for whom there is sleeping accommodation)!:—
[table]

Of the total number of establishments 51 belong to the Lombardo-Venetian provinces, 42 to the ancient continental provinces, 31 to the Tuscan provinces, 15 to the Parma and Modena provinces, 55 to the Roman, 80 to the Neapolitan, and 40 to the Sicilian and’Sardinian. The Government report indicates that of the convict establishments (central and secondary) 12 were neither healthy nor secure; the same was th j case with several of the houses of correction; and no fewer than 87 of the prisons are condemned for the hitter defect and 51 for the former.

In the convict establishments there were 17,576 prisoners in December 1879. The mean for 1870 was 13,663, and every succeeding year has seen an increase. In the ten years frbm 1870 to 1879 the total admissions have been 31,470. During that period 4846 received remission of their sentence, and 5176 died in prison. The following are the convict establishments, arranged in order of importance—Porto Longone, Civita Vecchia, Nisida, Palermo, Ancona, Cagliari, Orbetello, Genoa, Procida, Brindisi, Finalborgo, Gaeta, Pozzuoli, S. Stefano (Naples), Alghero, Castiadas, Favignana, Palermo, Pesaro, Piombino, Γorto Ferraio, Portici, Ponza, Porto d’Anzio, Terracina, and Trapani. The establishment at Varignano was made a lazaretto in 1871. See Stat. decennale delle carceri (1870-79), Civita Vecchia, 1880.

According to the confession of Italian investigators, the state of the judiciary prisons is often deplorable in the extreme. ‘ ‘ When I see,” writes Beltrami Scalia,^[28. Author of La Riformapenitenziaria in Italia, and founder of the Rivisla di disciplina carceraria, 1871.] “the enormous number of 44,415 individuals existing in the judiciary prisons in the beginning of 1875 (and the differences are not very great in the different years), the number of persons committed to prison amounting in the year to 356,511, and the number of those discharged to 257,854, when I see that, while 127,837 are liberated on the termination of their punishment or through act of clemency, no less than 81,087 owe their liberation to the fact that they have not been found guilty of the crimes laid to their charge, and when I consider the unhappy condition of most of our establishments of preventive detention, my heart aches to think what a hotbed of corruption they constitute, and what a current of moral pestilence must find issue from them.”

Capital punishment was in 1875, after much debate, adopted as the supreme penalty for the whole kingdom (inclusive of Tuscany, where it had not previously been in force); but in November 1877 the chambers voted by a large majority for the exclusion of the death-penalty from the new code. Between 1867 and 1876 inclusive 392 persons were condemned to death, but 351 received commutation of sentence, and only 34 were executed. In the same period 222 cases were subjected to a second trial, with the result that 20 of the accused parties were completely acquitted of the charge on which they had been previously condemned to death, and the whole of the remainder had their sentences commuted to penal servitude for life or some minor penalty. See Notizie sulle Condanni alla pena di morte (Rome, 1878), epitomized in Arch, di Stat., 1878.

Political Administration.— The constitution of the kingdom of Italy is based upon that presented to the Sardinians by King Charles Albert, 4th March 1848. The crown is hereditary in the male line of the house of Savoy. The king—whose majority is attained at the close of his eighteenth year—cannot exercise his legislative functions except in agreement with the voice of the national parliament, and on his accession to the throne he is bound to take, an oath in the presence of both chambers that he will obey the constitution. By the law of 17th March 1861 his title is “by God’s grace and through the will of the nation king of Italy.” His executive functions are exercised by means of responsible ministers, nine in number—(1) the minister of foreign affairs, (2) of the interior, (3)

of public instruction, (4) of finance and the treasury, (5) of war, (6) of marine, (7) of grace, justice, and worship, (8) of public works, (9) of agriculture, industry, and commerce. These departments are to all intents the same as those which under slightly different designations existed in the kingdom of Sardinia in 1860, just before the title of king of Italy was assumed by Victor Emmanuel. The ministry of agriculture, however, which was instituted by Cavour in July of that year, was abolished in 1878, but it was restored in 1879. A permanent hydrographic commission was instituted in 1866, a council of meteorology in 1876, and an independent board of statistics (Direzione della Statistical) in 1878. There was a meteorological department in connexion with the ministry of agriculture as early as 1865, and a statistical department as early as 1861.

The Italian parliament consists of two houses or chambers—a senate and a chamber of deputies. The senate consists of the princes of the royal family (who are admitted to the sittings at the age of twenty-one, but cannot vote till they have completed their twenty-fifth year) and an unlimited number of persons, forty years of age or upwards, chosen by the king from the ranks of the archbishops andbishops, ministers of thecrown and highadministrative functionaries, admirals and generals, members of the provincial councils and of the Turin academy, persons who have rendered special services to their country, or who for three years have paid 3000 lire of direct taxation. Since the removal to Rome the parliament is accommodated in the palace at Monte Citorio. Neither senators nor deputies are paid for their services, but they have the right to a free pass over the whole railway system of the country. All measures must be carried by an absolute majority, or one half of the members and one. The parliamentary oath does not contain the name of God; the member simply says, “I swear to be faithful to the king and loyally to observe the statutes and laws of the land.” According to the law there must be a new election every five years; the actual duration of parliaments, however, has hitherto been on an average two and a half.

The registered electors for 1879 amounted to 627,838, out of a population estimated at 28,437,091, or 2 ’ 21 per cent.; in other words, Italy has 7’77 electors in every 100 males above twenty-one years of age. The highest proportions were in Porto Maurizio 5 Ό6 per cent., Genoa 3’63, Leghorn 3‘67, and Alessandria 3 - 32 per cent. The lowest of all was Syracuse 0 - 07 per cent. Thirty-five provinces besides those mentioned had upwards of 2 per cent., and all the rest had upwards of 1 and less than 2. Of the total electorate 489,044 had their place on the roll through the payment of not less than 40 lire of direct Government taxes and provincial “super-imposts”; 5922 in virtue of the value of theiι∙ factories, workshops, or warehouses; 1412 as sea-captains or employers of at least 30 operatives; 1502 as holders of Government stock of the annual worth of 600 lire; 2934 in virtue of the amount of their house-rent,—making an aggregate of 15,158 whose right was due to their wealth. On the other hand there were 550 members of scientific academies, chambers of commerce, and directors of agrarian commissions; 5631 professors, ex-professors, and teachers in the higher institutions; 43,045 functionaries and employés, civil and military; 1452 persons decorated with the national orders of knighthood; 33,936 holders of university degrees (laureati); 27,522 solicitors, accountants, geometricians, chemists, &c.; 870 money agents and brokers,—making a total of 112,906 whose right depended on education and social influence.

According to the law of 1860, in force in 1880, there are 508 electoral colleges, or as they would be called in England parliamentary constituencies, the largest of which are the third college of Palermo with 84,767 inhabitants, and the third of Turin with 76,654, and the smallest S. Sepolcro with 30,463, and Benevento with 25,460.

The following table (XLI.) indicates the chief statistics of the eight elections which have taken place in Italy. They are interesting as showing an increase of political activity among the people. As is well known, the watchword of the ultramontane party has been “neither electors nor elected”; their abstention helps partly to explain the small percentage of the electors who have voted.^[29. An electoral map of Italy and a valuable analysis of the distribution of parties in 1880 will be found in Arch, di Stat., 1880, fasc. ill.]

Internal, Administration. — It was not till 1865 that the administrative unity of Italy was realized. Up to that year some of the regions of the kingdom, such as Tuscany, continued to have a kind of autonomy; but by the laws of 20th March the whole country was divided into 69 provinces and 8545 communes. The extent to which communal independence had been maintained in Italy through all the centuries of its political disintegration was strongly in its favour. By the new law the communal council was to consist of 80 members if the commune had more than 250,000 inhabitants, of 60 members if more than 60,000, of 40 if more than 30,000, of 30 if more than 10,000, of 20 if more than 3000, and in all other cases of 15. It was found by the census of 1861 that the first category was represented by only 1 commune, the second by 12, the third by 34, the fourth by 265, the fifth by 1762, and the sixth by 6471. As many of the communes, especially in the north, were found to have a very small population, a considerable number of them havé been wisely incorporated with others. The syndic {sindaco) or chief magistrate of the commune is appointed by the king for three years, and he is assisted by a “municipal junta” consisting of ten assessors and four substitutes for the communes of the first category, and of 8 + 4, 6 + 2, 4 + 2, and 2 + 2 respectively in those of the others. The communal council meets in ordinary course twice a year. Eligibility for office as a councillor is determined very much by the same considerations as affect the political suffrage, the main criterion being the amount of direct taxes paid. All those in receipt of communal salaries are excluded, and, if a sufficient number can be obtained without them, all who are unable to read.

The provincial councils consist of 60, 50, 40, or 20 members, according as the population exceeds 600,000, 400,000, or 200,000, or falls below this last number. Each council elects its own president; its sessions, which in regular course occur once a year, are opened and closed by the prefect or his substitute in the king’s name. The term of office for the provincial council is five years. A “provincial deputation” or standing committee, appointed by the council, acts under the presidency of the prefect as the representative of the same throughout the year.

The various sections of the local government—municipal, communal, and provincial councils—are left remarkably free from interference on the part of the central authorities. There is a prefect in every province, but, to quote Gallenga’s words, he is little more than the head of the provincial police. In point of local influence the syndic, who in the large cities is usually a nobleman or distinguished statesman, is the more important functionary.

The principal law regulative of communal taxation is that of July 3, 1864. By this the communes were allowed, not only to impose independently of the state an additional tax or super-impost {sovrimposta) on the articles already subjected to the national octroi, but also to charge a local customs duty on other articles of meat and drink, on forage, fuel, building materials, soaps, fatty matters, and other objects of the same class. Italy thus took rank, says Alessio, as one of the European countries in which the greatest liberty of taxation was granted to the local corporations. Further licence has been since conceded, in 1869, 1870, &c. In 1877 the total income of the communes amounted to 228,733,014 lire or nearly £9,115,000, and of this sum 38'71 per cent, was furnished by the communal octroi proper (dazio consumo), 31 - 24 by the super-impost on the land, 6'10 per cent, by the hearth-money or fuocatico, 3 - 27 by the tax on cattle and horses, and the remainder by a variety of taxes on public and private conveyances, dogs, domestics, riding and carriage horses, &c. A tax on photographs and insigne, first rendered legal in 1875, and only adopted by a few of the communes, is the least valuable on the list. Foreigners, except when they really take up permanent residence in a commune, are for the most part exempted from the local taxation. The effect of many of the taxes, especially as applied by the short-sighted local policy, has proved highly prejudicial to the development of industries. The tax, for instance, on wood and coal tells against the glassworks of Venice, the potteries of Florence, the gold and silver work of Milan. At Voltri taxes are paid on nearly all the raw materials of the cotton industry, on the coal, the petroleum, the oil, the very flour needed for the dressing of the stuffs, &c. Paper is taxed in many towns (at Bologna as much as 7 per cent.), at Genoa not only paper but printed matter, at Reggio Emilia types and printing machines. There is often a most extraordinary difference in the amount imposed on the same article: every quintal of wax for stearine candles, for example, pays 5 lire in one city, 10 in another, 40 in a third. In many cases, as at Bergamo, Como, Parma, &c., the result is that the factories show a tendency to locate themselves outside of the communal limits.^[32. See G. Alessio, “L'iraposta del dazio consumo in Italia,” in Annali di Stat., 1880.]

And in spite of this superabundant taxation the debts of the communes are unusually numerous, and in some instances give rise to grave concern. Italy has the honour of being the first of European nations to furnish regular returns in regard to the whole department of provincial and communal debts; and the light thrown by these on the state of the local finances is very instructive. At the inquiry in 1873 it was found that the total of the debts of the communes amounted to 545,129,128 lire, and that of the provinces to 54,401,390. By 1877 these figures had increased to 707,551,255 for the communes, and 90,073,603 for the provinces. Nearly the half of the communal increase of 162 millions was due to the two cities of Florence and Naples, the former being responsible for 36,933,905 lire of the increase, and the latter for 36,726,188 lire. The state of the Florentine finances is particularly noteworthy. It is estimated that the dazio consumo cost every inhabitant 30 - ll lire in 1877, and 31'58 in 1878 (the only other chief cities with similar amounts being Genoa, with respectively 33 ami 27⅜ lire, and Rome with 28⅜ and 29.⅛), and the total communal taxation is stated at 54 lire per head. On March 18, 1878, Florence suspended payment of the capital and three months later of the interest on its debts, which amounted to about 160,000,000 lire. A royal commission was appointed in J une 1879 for the liquidation of the debt, and it put into operation a scheme by which the debt will be cleared off by 1939. Full details will be found in the Report of the British Consul for Florence, 1880, or in Mr Anthony Trollope’s interesting survey in the British and Foreign Quarterly heview, 1879. The other cities where the local customs press heaviest on the citizens are Palermo and Catania (20 lire), Leghorn (nearly 20), Siena (19), Pavia (18), Milan (17), Turin (16). Among those that suffer least are Belluno, Arezzo, and Sondrio. At the close of 1878 it was calculated that the quota of the communal debt for every individual would amount to 913’62 lire at Florence, to 309'60 at Pisa, to 274 at Genoa, to 248 ’ 52 at Naples, and that on an average of all the caρoluogi or provincial chief towns the quota would be 140’96 lire. See Statistica dci debiti commτιnali al l o Gcnnaio 1879 (Rome, 1880).

Finance. — It is not every Government even in a country of exceptional wealth like England that is able to keep the balance on the right side of the national account; in Italy it long seemed as if no Government could do so. To attain the pareggio, or in familiar phrase to make both ends meet, was the dream and the despair of minister after minister. Money was wanted for so many things; taxes of any considerable value could be imposed on so few. The various parts of the national organization had to be put with all possible speed into a condition not altogether unworthy of the prestige and the promise of the kingdom. What in other countries had been the growth of generations, Italy was called upon to produce at once by “forcing.” To attain her nominal or political unity she had to submit to many sacrifices; to make the unity something better than a musical word, she had to submit to many more. That she should have spent so much on her army, her fortifications, and her fleet, is matter of regret in spite of the secondary purposes which such things subserve; that at the same time she has aimed high, and acted liberally in respect of more needful if less ostentatious departments, is worthy of admiration, and, in judging of what she has attained, it must never be forgotten what an inheritance of debt and disorganization passed over to her from the states which she supplanted.

The following table (XL·II.) of debt, revenue, and expenditure (given in millions of lire =£40,000), shows that on the whole the financial condition of the country, considered in itself and apart from the causes to which it is due, is an improving if not a satisfactory one. It must be noted that in the columns of revenue and expenditure no account is taken of the movement of the capitals, of the expenses connected with the railway system, or of the debts and payments of one part of the administration to another.
[table]

If the items excluded from the above comparison be taken into consideration, the revenue and expenditure will stand for the later years as follows (Table XL1II.):—
[table]

The most noticeable facts indicated by Table XLII. are(l)the rapid increase of the national debt, which at the declaration of the kingdom of Italy in 1861 amounted to only 3,131,053,610 lire, so that it more than doubled itself in seven years and more than trebled [9:13:465] itself in twelve, and (2) the attainment during five consecutive years of a very considerable surplus. The following table (XLIV. gives the official report on the items of the national debt in 1879:—
[table]

The figures, it must be noted, represent the interest, not the capital. A large proportion of the Italian consols are held in small amounts, for the most part by French investors, and the greatest holder after France appears to be England. In the Bourse of Paris in 1879, for instance, 11,912,000 lire of the stock were presented for certification, in the Exchange of London 8,319,000 lire; and after these places comes Berlin with only 1,453,000 lire. The value of the 5 per cent, stock at Paris, which was as low as 39 - 40 in the course of 1866, has risen rapidly nearly every year, especially since 1875, and in the course of 1880 was as high as 87’60. A similar advance was observable in the Italian exchanges; from 43 - 52 in 1866 the value rose to 94 - 20 in 1880.

In the matter of taxation the Italian statesmen have mainly followed in the footsteps of the French; and the revenue is eked out by several imposts of the most questionable character. Mr Gallenga even goes so far as to say that * ‘ there is hardly an unwise, inhuman, unpopular, or even immoral tax to which the Government has not been compelled to resort.” It is a small matter that the aurum lustrale of ancient Pome should again figure in the Italian budget; but it is a serious thing when the salt monopoly, the lottery, a gristtax, and an octroi are among the most important of its items. The grist-tax, which pressed heavily on the very means of life, and aggravated the already aggravated misery of the poorer classes, has happily been reduced in 1880 from 2 lire to Γ50 per hectolitre, and is destined to disappear altogether in 1884. Against the octroi, which, as shown in the paragraph dealing with the communal administration, tells severely on the prosperity of several important industries, an intelligent opposition is beginning to gather head; and the law in this respect will probably be amended or abrogated before long. The following table (XLV. ) gives the actual revenue of the Government for 1878 and 1879, the actual expenditure for 1878, and the estimated expenditure for 1879, all in lire:—
[table]
[table]

The relative importance of the various sources of revenue may be seen from the following figures in millions of lire ( = .£40,000), show-the totals for the ten years 1871-1880 (Table XLVI.):^[34. See Marpurgo, Sulla finanza nazionale, Rome, 1874.] —

Banks.— By the law of April 30th 18/4, the right of issuing bank notes was limited to six banks—the National Bank of the Kingdom of Italy founded by the Sardinian law of 1850, the National Tuscan Bank founded by the grand-duke in 1857, the Roman Bank constituted by papal authority in 1850, the Tuscan Bank of Credit for industry and commerce established by the provisional Tuscan Government in 1860, the Bank of Naples dating from 1816, and the Bank of Sicily due to a decree of 1843. The two Tuscan banks and the Roman and the National Bank are joint-stock companies, with their capital subscribed in shares. The capital of the four joint-stock banks amounted in the aggregate to 255,000,000 lire, of which 200,000,000 belonged to the National Bank, 30,000,000 to the National Tuscan, 15,000,000 to the Roman, and 10,000,000 to the Tuscan Credit. By the law of 1874 the Bank of Naples was authorized to carry its capital by 1885 to 48,750,000 lire, and the Bank of Sicily to 12,000,000; the actual amounts in 1877 were 39,000,000 in the one case, and 9,200,000 in the other. The law just mentioned united the six banks into a consorzio or union, bound if required to furnish to the national exchequer bank-notes to the value of 1,000,000,000 lire manufactured and renewed at their common expense; but by the law of 7th April 1881 (mentioned in detail further on) the consorzio ceased on the 30th June 1881. The following table (XLVII.) indicates the position of the issue of bank notes both by the consortium and by the individual banks on their own account on the 30th September 1880.
[table]

The total aggregate amounts to nearly 1,665,000,000 lire.

The following table (XLVIII.) gives details (the amounts in millions of lire) as to the working of the institutions in 1879 :—
[table]

The total amount of the circulation and deposits of all the six banks thus amounted to 863,160,000 lire, while that of the Bank of England alone at the same date was 1,657,234,000.

The following table (XLIX.) indicates the number of the various joint-stock credit institutions at the close of 1878 :—
[9:13:466]
[table]

In 1869 the corresponding list comprised 352 institutions, with a total capital of 1,576,834,299 lire. The agrarian banks were instituted by the Act of June 21, 1869, and in 1870 they were three in number, with a capital of 6,450,000 lire. The twelve existing in 1879 were situated at Alessandria, Asti, Bologna, Oristano (in Sardinia), Cagliari (in Sardinia), Arbora and Casalmaggiore, Florence, Mantua, Terranuova Pausania, Siena, and Cologna Veneta.

The minister of agriculture published in 1880 an account of the friendly societies in the kingdom (Statistica delle Socictà di mutuo Soccorso, anno 1878), from which it appears they are rapidly on the increase. In the following table (L. ) the second column gives the population of the country, the third the number of societies known to exist, the fourth the number of the societies which gave information of their strength to the Government, and the fifth the number of the members :—
[table]

It appears that 50 of these societies existed before 1850, and that 186 were commenced between that year and 1861. How rapid the increase has been is shown by the fact that in 1876, 1877, and 1878 there were nearly as many new societies started annually as in that decade. Piedmont, Lombardy, Tuscany, and Sicily are the districts where the number is greatest. For the most part the societies are open to operatives in any trade or industry, but at least 391 are exclusively intended for some particular class— e.g., doctors, employes, teachers, &e. Of the 2091 indicated, 1537 are for men only, 70 for women only, and 484 for either.

Ba·nche popolari, or people’s banks, corresponding to the Credit-genosscnchaften of Germany, have increased in number from 40 in 1869 to 123 in 1878. From a paper by Luzzati, the enthusiastic and laborious president of the association of the people’s banks, we find that 84 of these institutions which furnished him with details of their working had at the close of 1877 a capital of 34,941,593 lire, divided into 710,869 shares, and a reserve fund of 10,436,143 lire. The greater number of these banks are in Lombardy, Venice, Piedmont, and Liguria. Societies of ordinary credit increased from 19 in 1869 to 143 in 1873, but by 1878 the number had again sunk to 102, owing to the monetary crises through which the country had passed.

Currency.— Italy is a member of the Latin monetary league founded in 1865. By this the coining of pieces worth 2 lire or less was limited to 6 lire per inhabitant, so that the amount of such coins permissible before the incorporation of Venice was 141,000,000, and after that date 156,000,000. By the convention of 1875 the coining of silver coins of 5 lire was limited to 50,000,000, and this amount was reduced to 30,000,000 by the convention of 1876. The actual value coined from 1862 to 1875 has been :—gold, 236,167,200 lire; silver— 5 lire pieces, 281,637,025, and pieces of minor value (1 lire, 2 lire, 20 centesimi, and 50 centesimi), all coined between 1862 and 1868 inclusive, 156,000,000; bronze, 76,190,442 lire. By the conventions of 1878 and 1879 it was agreed that the minor silver coinage of Italy should not be received in the public exchequer of the other states of the league until an end was put to the forced paper currency; and France, Belgium, Greece, and Switzerland have undertaken to withdraw it from circulation in their respective territories, and to
[table]

collect it at Paris, the Italian Government agreeing to exchange it for gold or silver scudi.

The Italian Government has been put to much expense in the matter of the unification of the coinage, and the process of withdrawing the coins of the separate ex-Governments is still going on. Table LI. indicates the value in lire of the coins withdrawn from circulation between 1862 and 1871.

From 1872 to 1879 the value of the gold withdrawn was 6,080,295 lire, and that of the silver 143,130,871; of the total (149,211,166 lire) the greater proportion (129,898,338) belonged to the Two Sicilies and 16,815,207 to Rome. In 1866 the Government felt itself constrained to establish a forced paper currency; the proposals made from time to time for its abrogation remained mere proposals till 1881. The parliament of that year, however, passed an Act (7th April), on the basis of a bill presented by the ministers Magliani and Miceli, of which the chief features are as follows:^[35. Much interesting matter on the whole commercial condition of Italy is to be found in this Act,] —The forced currency is to be brought to an end by the close of 1883,—644,000,000 lire of metallic money (400,000,000 of the amount in gold being obtained by a foreign loan); of these, 44,000,000 lire to be given to the National Bank as repayment of the loan in gold made to the state in 1875, which, according to the contract, was to be repaid three months before the cessation of the forced currency; the remaining 600,000,000 to be employed in withdrawing from circulation that amount of the “consortial” or union notes, of which 940,000,000 lire are in circulation,—the 340,000,000 to become regular Government notes payable at sight in the principal Government treasuries; all the small notes of 50 centesimi, 1, 2, and 5 lire, the circulation of which in September 1879 amounted to 315,500,000 lire, to be got rid of, as well as 284,000,000 in notes of 1000, 250, and 100 lire,—so that the 340,000,000 lire in regular notes left in existence should all be of the value of 10 and 20 lire, with the exception of 46,500,000 in larger amounts. The consortium of the banks came to a close on the 30th June 1881, and the “consortial” notes actually current are formed into a direct national debt.

Titles of Honour.— The recent existence of so many separate sovereignties and “fountains of honour” as a matter of course gave rise to a great many hereditary titles of nobility. There are 400 princes, 458 dukes, 985 marquises, 1679 counts, 353 barons, and 5 viscounts in the country; as well as 1234 persons of “patrician” rank, 2273 with a right to the designation nobile, 318 distinctively signori, and 46 hereditary knights or cavalieri in the kingdom. In the “Golden Book of the Capitol” (Libro d'Oro del Camρidoglio) are inscribed 321 patrician families, and of these 28 have the title of prince and 8 that of duke, while the others are marquises, counts, or simply patricians. Five orders of knighthood are recognized :—the order of the Annunciation (Ordine Supremo dell' Annunziata'), which dates from 1362, the order of St Maurice and St Lazarus (1434), the military order of Savoy (1815), the civil order of Savoy (1833), and the order of the Crown of Italy, instituted in 1868. The king’s brother is duke of Aosta, his eldest son is prince of Naples, and his cousin is duke of Genoa.

Βi ∣ liography.— The most elaborate work on Italy is L'Italia sotto l'aspetto fisico, storico, <fcc∙, published by Vallardi of Milan, and comprising (1) Dizionario Corografico, edited by Amato Amati, 9 sols. imp. 8vo., of upwards of 1100 pages each; (2) Geologia d'Italia, by Stoppani and Negri; (3) oro∙ιdrografla, by De Bartolomeis; (4) Argue minerali, by Marient; (5) Compendio della flora italiana, by Cesati, Passerini, and Gibelii; (6) Fauna d'Italia, by Cornalia, Canestrini, Salvador!, and De-Betta; (7) a series of historical studies— Storia antica and I Barbari, by Bertolini; I Comuni, by Lanziano, &c. Some of these divisions are only in course of publication (1881), but the Dizionario Corografico and several other important sections are eitlιer complete or approaching completion, worthy in its own department to rank with this great work is Gaetano Cantoni’s Enciclo-pedia agraria italiana, which contains voluminous articles on the various objects and methods of agriculture in the country, on its climate, soils, irrigation systems, and the like. The chief agricultural periodicals are the Government A nnalι di Agricoltura, edited by Targioni-Tozzetti, and the L’Agricoltura Italiana, formerly Rivista dι Agricoltura. The publications of the Government board of statistics, frequently referred to in the foregoing pages, are numerous and various. The Annuario Statistico (vol. ii., 1881) contains an epitome of the various official reports. Questions both of national and international scope are discussed in the Annali di Statistica (new series dating from 1878), and in the Archivio di Statistica, founded by Professor Bodio and a company of statisticians in 1871. Of non-Govemment statistical publications there is no lack. It is sufficient to mention Annuario del commercio ed industria del regno d'Italia, Florence, 1868, &c.; Annuario statistico delle proτincie italiane, Florence, 1872; Annuario istorico ιtalιano, Milan, 1870, &c.; Guida generale del commercio e dell' industria italiana, Milan, 1880; Annuario indus , riale italiano, Naples, 1880; Parela, Saggio di climatologia e di geografla nosologica dell’ Italia, Turin, 1881. Gazetteers of less scope than Amati's Dizionario are Muzzi, Vocabulario geografico-storico·statistico, Bologna, 1873-74; Altavilla, Il Regno d'Italia, Turin, 1875; and Stivieri, Geogr. e statistica comm, del regno d'Italia, Venice, 1879. Contributions to Italian geography and sociology naturally appear from time to time in the Bolletlino of the Italian Geogr. Soc., Rome, 1870; in Guido Cora’s Cosmos, Turin, 1872, <tc.∙, the Rivista Europea, Florence; and the A'uoι , α Antologia, Florence; not to mention the periodical publications of scientific societies so well known as the Accademia dei Lincei, <fcc. The literature issued in foreign countries in regard to Italy is very extensive, but too frequently the works are slight and “occasional.” A bibliography of German contributions to the subject was compiled by Gregorovius, whose own works make no small addition to the list. Recent English works are Wordsworth, Italy: Journal of a Tour, London, 1863; W. W. Story, Roba di Roma, London, 1863, and; Graffiti d'Italia, 1868; Elliot. Diary in Italy.

[9:13:467] PART II.—HISTORY.

The difficulty of Italian history lies in this that until our own time the Italians have had no political unity, no independence, no organized existence as a nation. Split up into numerous and mutually hostile communities, they never, through the fourteen centuries which have elapsed since the end of the old Western empire, shook off the yoke of foreigners completely; they never until lately learned to merge their local and conflicting interests in the common good of undivided Italy. Their history is therefore not the history of a single people, centralizing and absorbing its constituent elements by a process of continued evolution, but of a group of cognate populations, exemplifying divers types of constitutional development.

Without attaching undue importance to the date 476 as marking the boundary between ancient and modern history, there is no doubt that this year opened a new age for thé Italian people. Odovakar, a chief of the Herulians, deposed Romulus, the last Augustus of the West, and placed the peninsula beneath the titular sway of the Byzantine emperors. At Pavia the barbarian conquerors of Italy proclaimed him king, and he received from Zeno the dignity of Roman patrician. Thus began that system of mixed government, Teutonic and Roman, which, in the absence of a national monarch, impressed the institutions of new Italy from the earliest date with dualism. The same revolution vested supreme authority in a non-resident and inefficient autocrat, whose title gave him the right to interfere in Italian affairs, but who lacked the power and will to rule the people for his own or their advantage. Odovakar inaugurated that long series of foreign rulers— Greeks, Franks, Germans, Spaniards, and Austrians—who have successively contributed to the misgovernment of Italy from distant seats of empire.

Gothic and Lombard Kingdoms.

In 488 Theodoric, king of the East Goths, received commission from the Greek emperor, Zeno, to undertake the affairs of Italy. He defeated Odovakar, drove him to Ravenna, besieged him there, and in 493 completed the conquest of the country by murdering the Herulian chief with his own hand. Theodoric respected the Roman institutions which he found in Italy, held the Eternal City sacred, and governed by ministers chosen from the Roman population. He settled at Ravenna, which had been the capita] of Italy since the days of Honorius, and which still testifies by its monuments to the Gothic chieftain’s Romanizing policy. Those who believe that the Italians would have gained strength by unification in a single monarchy must regret that this Gothic kingdom lacked the elements of stability. The Goths, except in the valley of the Po, resembled an army of occupation rather than a people numerous enough to blend with the Italic stock. Though their rule was favourable to the Romans, they were Arians; and religious differences, combined with the pride and jealousies of a nation accustomed to imperial honours, rendered the inhabitants of Italy eager to throw off their yoke. When, therefore, Justinian undertook the reconquest of Italy, his generals, Belisarius and Narses, were supported by the south. The struggle of the Greeks and the Goths was carried on for fourteen years, between 539 and 553, when Teia, the last Gothic king, was finally defeated in a bloody battle near Vesuvius. At its close the provinces of Italy were placed beneath Greek dukes, controlled by a governor-general, entitled exarch, who ruled in the Byzantine emperor’s name at Ravenna.

This new settlement lasted but a few years. Narses had employed Lombard auxiliaries in his campaigns against the Goths; and when he was recalled by an insulting message from the empress in 565, he is said to have invited this fiercest and rudest of the Teutonic clans to seize the spoils of Italy. Be this as it may, the Lombards, their ranks swelled by the Gepidae, whom they had lately conquered, and by the wrecks of other barbarian tribes, passed southward under their king Alboin in 568. The Herulian invaders had been but a band of adventurers; the Goths were an army; the Lombards, far more formidable, were a nation in movement. Pavia offered stubborn resistance; but after a three years’ siege it was taken, and Alboin made it the capital of his new kingdom.

In order to understand the future history of Italy, it is necessary to form a clear conception of the method pursued by the Lombards in their conquest. Penetrating the peninsula, and advancing like a glacier or half-liquid stream of mud, they occupied the valley of the Po, and moved slowly downward through the centre of the country. Numerous as they were compared with their Gothic predecessors, they had not strength or multitude enough to occupy the whole peninsula. Venice, which since the days of Attila had offered an asylum to Roman refugees from the northern cities, was left untouched. So was Genoa with its Riviera. Ravenna, entrenched within her lagoons, remained a Greek city. Rome, protected by invincible prestige, escaped. The sea-coast cities of the south, and the islands, Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica, preserved their independence. Thus the Lombards neither occupied the extremities nor subjugated the brain-centre of the country. The strength of Alboin’s kingdom was in the north; his capital, Pavia. As his people pressed southward, they omitted to possess themselves of the coasts; and what was worse for the future of these conquerors, the original impetus of the invasion was checked by the untimely murder of Alboin in 573. After this event, the semi-independent chiefs of the Lombard tribe, who borrowed the title of dukes from their Roman predecessors, seem to have been contented with consolidating their power in the districts each had occupied. The duchies of Spoleto in the centre, and of Benevento in the south, inserted wedge-like into the middle of the peninsula, and enclosing independent Rome, were but loosely united to the kingdom at Pavia. Italy was broken up into districts, each offering points for attack from without, and fostering the seeds of internal revolution. Three separate capitals must be discriminated—Pavia, the seat of the new Lombard kingdom; Ravenna, the garrison city of the Byzantine emperor; and Rome, the rallying point of the old nation, where the successor of St Peter was already beginning to assume that national protectorate which proved so influential in the future.

It is not necessary to write the history of the Lombard kingdom in detail. Suffice it to say that the rule of the Lombards proved at first far more oppressive to the native population, and was less intelligent of their old customs, than that of the Goths had been. Wherever the Lombards had the upper hand, they placed the country under military rule, resembling in its general character what we now know as the feudal system. Though there is reason to suppose that the Roman laws were still administered within the cities, yet the Lombard code was that of the kingdom; and the Lombards being Arians, they added the oppression of religious intolerance to that of martial despotism and barbarous cupidity. The Italians were reduced to the last extremity when Gregory the Great [9:13:468] (590-604), having strengthened his position by diplomatic relations with the duchy of Spoleto, and brought about the conversion of the Lombards to orthodoxy, raised the cause of the remaining Roman population throughout Italy. The fruit of his policy, which made of Rome a counterpoise against the effete empire of the Greeks upon the one hand and against the pressure of the feudal kingdom on the other, was seen in the succeeding century. When Leo the Isaurian published his decrees against the worship of images in 726, Gregory II. allied himself with Liudprand, the Lombard king, threw off allegiance to Byzantium, and established the autonomy of Rome. This pope initiated the dangerous policy of playing one hostile force off against another with a view to securing independence. He used the Lombards in his struggle with the Greeks, leaving to his successors the duty of checking these unnatural allies. This was accomplished by calling the Franks in against the Lombards. Liudprand pressed hard, not only upon the Greek dominions of the exarchate, but also upon Rome. His successors, Rachis and Astolf, attempted to follow the same game of conquest. But the popes, Gregory III., Zachary, and Stephen II., determining at any cost to espouse the national cause and to aggrandize their own office, continued to rely upon the Franks. Pippin twice crossed the Alps, and forced Astolf to relinquish his acquisitions, including Ravenna, Pentapolis, the coast towns of Romagna, and some cities in the duchy of Spoleto. These he handed over to the pope of Rome. This donation of Pippin in 756 confirmed the papal see in the protectorate of the Italic party, and conferred upon it sovereign rights. The virtual outcome of the contest carried on by Rome since the year 726 with Byzantium and Pavia was to place the popes in the position held by the Greek exarch, and to confirm the limitation of the Lombard kingdom. We must, however, be cautious to remember that the south of Italy was comparatively unaffected. The dukes of the Greek empire and the Lombard dukes of Benevento, together with a few autonomous commercial cities, still divided Italy below the Campagna of Rome.

Prankish Emperors.

The Franko-Papal alliance, which conferred a crown on Pippin and sovereign rights upon the see of Rome, held within itself that ideal of mutually supporting papacy and empire which exercised so powerful an influence in mediaeval history. When Charles the Great (Charlemagne) deposed his father-in-law Desiderius, the last Lombard king, in 774, and when he received the circlet of the empire from Leo III. at Rome in 800, he did but complete and ratify the compact offered to his grandfather, Charles Martel, by Gregory III. The relations between the new emperor and the pope were ill defined; and this proved the source of infinite disasters to Italy and Europe in the sequel. But for the moment each seemed necessary to the other; and that sufficed. Charles took possession of the kingdom of Italy, as limited by Pippin’s settlement. The pope was confirmed in his rectorship of the cities ceded by Astolf, with the further understanding, tacit rather than expressed, that, even as he had wrung these provinces for the Italic people from both Greeks and Lombards, so in the future he might claim the protectorate of such portions of Italy, external to the kingdom, as he should be able to acquire. This, at any rate, seems to be the meaning of that obscure re-settlement of the peninsula which Charles effected. The kingdom of Italy, transmitted on his death by Charles the Great, and afterwards confirmed to his grandson Lothar by the peace of Verdun in 843, stretched from the Alps to Terracina. The duchy of Benevento remained tributary, but independent. The cities of Gaeta and Naples, Sicily, and the so-called Theme of Lombardy in South Apulia and Calabria, still recognized the Byzantine emperor. Venice stood aloof, professing a nominal allegiance to the East. The parcels into which the Lombards had divided the peninsula remained thus virtually unaltered, except for the new authority acquired by the see of Rome.

Internally Charles left the affairs of the Italian kingdom much as he found them, except that he appears to have pursued the policy of breaking up the larger fiefs of the Lombards, substituting counts for their dukes, and adding to the privileges of the bishops. We may reckon these measures among the earliest advantages extended to the cities, which still contained the bulk of the old Roman population, and which were destined to intervene with decisive effect two centuries later in Italian history. It should also here be noticed that the changes introduced into the holding of the fiefs, whether by altering their boundaries or substituting Frankish for Lombard vassals, were chief among the causes why the feudal system took no permanent hold in Italy. Feudalism was not at any time a national institution. The hierarchy of dukes and marquises and counts consisted of foreign soldiers imposed on the indigenous inhabitants; and the rapid succession of conquerors, Lombards, Franks, and Germans following each other at no long interval, and each endeavouring to weaken the remaining strength of his predecessor, prevented this alien hierarchy from acquiring fixity by permanence of tenure. Among the many miseries inflicted upon Italy by the frequent changes of her northern rulers, this at least may be reckoned a blessing.

The Italians acknowledged eight kings of the house of Charles the Great, ending in Charles the Fat, who was deposed in 888. After them followed ten sovereigns, some of whom have been misnamed Italians by writers too eager to catch at any resemblance of national glory for a people passive in the hands of foreign masters, The truth is that no period in Italian history was less really glorious than that which came to a close in 961 by Berengar H.’s cession of his rights to Otto the Great. It was a period marked in the first place by the conquests of the Saracens, who began to occupy Sicily early in the 9th century, overran Calabria and Apulia, took Bari, and threatened Rome. In the second place it was marked by a restoration of the Greeks to power. In 890 they established themselves again at Bari, and ruled the Theme of Lombardy by means of an officer entitled Catapan. In the third place it was marked by a decline of good government in Rome. Early in the 10th century the papacy fell into the hands of a noble family, known eventually as the counts of Tusculum, who almost succeeded in rendering the office hereditary, and in uniting the civil and ecclesiastical functions of the city under a single member of their house. It is not necessary to relate the scandals of Marozia’s and Theodora’s female reign, the infamies of John XII., or the intrigues which tended to convert Rome into a duchy. The most important fact for the historian of Italy to notice is that during this time the popes abandoned, not only their high duties as chiefs of Christendom, but also their protectorate of Italian liberties. A fourth humiliating episode in this period was the invasion of the Magyar barbarians, who overran the north of Italy, and reduced its fairest provinces to the condition of a wilderness. Anarchy and misery are indeed the main features of that long space of time which elapsed between the death of Charles the Great and the descent of Otto. Through the almost impenetrable darkness and confusion we only discern this much, that Italy was powerless to constitute herself a nation.

The discords which followed on the break-up of the Carolingian power, and the weakness of the so-called Italian emperors, who were unable to control the feudatories [9:13:469] (marquises of Ivrea and Tuscany, dukes of Friuli and Spoleto), from whose ranks they sprang, exposed Italy to ever-increasing misrule. The country by this time had become thickly covered over with castles, the seats of greater or lesser nobles, all of whom were eager to detach themselves from strict allegiance to the “Regno.” The cities, exposed to pillage by Huns in the north and Saracens in the south, and ravaged on the coast by Norse pirates, asserted their right to enclose themselves with walls, and taught their burghers the use of arms. Within the circuit of their ramparts, the bishops already began to exercise authority in rivalry with the counts, to whom, since the days of Theodoric, had been entrusted the government of the Italian burghs. Agreeably to feudal customs, these nobles, as they grew in power, retired from the town, and built themselves fortresses on points of vantage in the neighbourhood. Thus the titular king of Italy found himself simultaneously at war with those great vassals who had chosen him from their own class, with the turbulent factions of the Roman aristocracy, with unruly bishops in the growing cities, and with the multitude of minor counts and barons who occupied the open lands, and who changed sides according to the interests of the moment. The last king of the quasi-Italian succession, Berengar II., marquis of Ivrea (951-961), made a vigorous effort to restore the authority of the regno; and had he succeeded, it is not impossible that now at the last moment Italy might have become an independent nation. But this attempt at unification was reckoned to Berengar for a crime. He only won the hatred of all classes, and was represented by the obscure annalists of that period as an oppressor of the church and a remorseless tyrant. In Italy, divided between feudal nobles and almost hereditary ecclesiastics, of foreign blood and alien sympathies, there was no national feeling. Berengar stood alone against a multitude, unanimous in their intolerance of discipline. His predecessor in the kingdom, Lothar, had left a young and beautiful widow, Adelheid. Berengar imprisoned her upon the Lake of Como, and threatened her with a forced marriage to his son Adalbert. She escaped to the castle of Canossa, where the great count of Tuscany espoused her cause, and appealed in her behalf to Otto the Saxon. The king of Germany descended into Italy, and took Adelheid in marriage. After this episode Berengar was more discredited and impotent than ever. In the extremity of his fortunes he had recourse himself to Otto, making a formal cession of the Italian kingdom, in his own name and that of his son Adalbert, to the Saxon as his overlord. By this slender tie the crown of Italy was joined to that of Germany; and the formal right of the elected king of Germany to be considered king of Italy and emperor may be held to have accrued from this epoch.

The German Emperors.

Berengar gained nothing by his act of obedience to Otto. The great Italian nobles, in their turn, appealed to Germany. Otto entered Lombardy in 961, deposed Berengar, assumed the crown in St Ambrogio at Milan, and in 962 was proclaimed emperor by John XII. at Rome. Henceforward Italy changed masters according as one or other of the German families assumed supremacy beyond the Alps. It is one of the strongest instances furnished by history of the fascination exercised by an idea that the Italians themselves should have grown to glory in this dependence of their nation upon Caesars who had nothing but a name in common with the Roman Imperator of the past.

The first thing we have to notice in this revolution which placed Otto the Great upon the imperial throne is that the Italian kingdom, founded by the Lombards, recognized by the Franks, and recently claimed by eminent Italian feudatories, virtually ceased to exist. It was merged in the German kingdom; and, since for the German princes Germany was of necessity their first care, Italy from this time forward began to be left more and more to herself. The central authority of Pavia had always been weak; the regno had proved insufficient to combine the nation. But now even that shadow of union disappeared, and the Italians were abandoned to the slowly working influences which tended to divide them into separate states. The most brilliant period of their chequered history, the period which includes the rise of communes, the exchange of municipal liberty for despotism, and the gradual discrimination of the five great powers (Milan, Venice, Florence, the Papacy, and the kingdom of Naples), now begins. Among the centrifugal forces which determined the future of the Italian race must be reckoned, first and foremost, the new spirit of municipal independence. We have seen how the cities enclosed themselves with walls, and how the bishops defined their authority against that of the counts. Otto encouraged this revolution by placing the enclosures of the chief burghs beyond the jurisdiction of the counts. Within those precincts the bishops and the citizens were independent of all feudal masters but the emperor. He further broke the power of the great vassals by redivisions of their feuds, and by the creation of new marches which he assigned to his German followers. In this way, owing to the dislocation of the ancient aristocracy, to the enlarged jurisdiction of a power so democratic as the episcopate, and to the increased privileges of the burghs, feudalism received a powerful check in Italy. The Italian people, that people which gave to the world the commerce and the arts of Florence, was not indeed as yet apparent. But the conditions under which it could arise, casting from itself all foreign and feudal trammels, recognizing its true past in ancient Rome, and reconstructing a civility out of the ruins of those glorious memories, were now at last granted. The nobles from this time forward retired into the country and the mountains, fortified themselves in strong places outside the cities, and gave their best attention to fostering the rural population. Within the cities and upon the open lands the Italians, in this and the next century, doubled, trebled, and quadrupled their numbers. A race was formed strong enough to keep the empire itself in check, strong enough, except for its own internecine contests, to have formed a nation equal to its happier neighbours.

The recent scandals of the papacy induced Otto to deprive the Romans of their right to elect popes. But when he died in 973, his son Otto II. (married to Theophano of the imperial Byzantine house) and his grandson, Otto HL, who descended into Italy in 996, found that the affairs of Rome and of the southern provinces were more than even their imperial powers could cope with. The faction of the counts of Tusculum raised its head from time to time in the Eternal City, and Rome still claimed to be a commonwealth. Otto III.’s untimely death in 1002 introduced new discords. Rome fell once more into the hands of her nobles. The Lombards chose Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, for king, and Pavia supported his claims against those of Henry of Bavaria, who had been elected in Germany. Milan sided with Henry; and this is perhaps the first eminent instance of cities being reckoned powerful allies in the Italian disputes of sovereigns. It is also the first instance of that bitter feud between the two great capitals of Lombardy, a feud rooted in ancient antipathies between the Roman population of Mediolanum and the Lombard garrison of Alboin’s successors, which proved so disastrous to the national cause. Ardoin retired to a monastery, where he died in 1015. Henry nearly destroyed Pavia, was crowned in Rome, and died in 1024. After this event [9:13:470] Heribert, the archbishop of Milan, invited Conrad, the Franconian king of Germany, into Italy, and crowned him with the iron crown of the kingdom.

The intervention of this man, Heribert, compels us to turn a closer glance upon the cities of North Italy. It is here, at the present epoch and for the next two centuries, that the pith and nerve of the Italian nation must be sought; and among the burghs of Lombardy, Milan, the eldest daughter of ancient Rome, assumes the lead. In Milan we hear for the first time the word Comune. In Milan the citizens first form themselves into a Parlamento. In Milan the archbishop organizes the hitherto voiceless, defenceless population into a community capable of expressing its needs, and an army ready to maintain its rights. To Heribert is attributed the invention of the Carroccio, which played so singular and important a part in the warfare of Italian cities. A huge car drawn by oxen, bearing the standard of the burgh, and carrying an altar with the host, this carroccio, like the ark of the Israelites, formed a rallying point in battle, and reminded the armed artisans that they had a city and a church to fight for. That Heribert’s device proved effectual in raising the spirit of his burghers, and consolidating them into a formidable band of warriors, is shown by the fact that it was speedily adopted in all the free cities. It must not, however, be supposed that at this epoch the liberties of the burghs were fully developed. The mass of the people remained unrepresented in the government; and even if the consuls existed in the days of Heribert, they were but humble legal officers, transacting business for their constituents in the courts of the bishop and his viscount. It still needed nearly a century of struggle to render the burghers independent of lordship, with a fully organized commune, selfgoverned in its several assemblies. While making these reservations, it is at the same time right to observe that certain Italian communities were more advanced upon the path of independence than others. This is specially the case with the maritime ports. Not to mention Venice, which has not yet entered the Italian community, and remains a Greek free city, Genoa and Pisa were rapidly rising into ill-defined autonomy. Their command of fleets gave them incontestable advantages, as when, for instance, Otto II. employed the Pisans in 980 against the Greeks in Lower Italy, and the Pisans and Genoese together attacked the Saracens of Sardinia in 1017. Still, speaking generally, the age of independence for the burghs had only begun when Heribert from Milan undertook the earliest organization of a force that was to become paramount in peace and war.

Next to Milan, and from the point of view of general politics even more than Milan, Rome now claims attention. The destinies of Italy depended upon the character which the see of St Peter should assume. Even the liberties of her republics in the north hung on the issue of a contest which in the 11th and 12th centuries shook Europe to its furthest boundaries. So fatally were the internal affairs of that magnificent but unhappy country bound up with concerns which brought the forces of the civilized world into play. Her ancient prestige, her geographical position, and the intellectual primacy of her most noble children rendered Italy the battleground of principles that set all Christendom in motion, and by the clash of which she found herself for ever afterwards divided. During the reign of Conrad II., the party of the counts of Tusculum revived in Rome; and Crescentius, claiming the title of consul in the imperial city, sought once more to control the election of the popes. When Henry III., the son of Conrad, entered Italy in 1046, he found three popes in Rome. These he abolished, and, taking the appointment into his own hands, gave German bishops to the see. The policy thus initiated Upon the precedent laid down by Otto the Great was a remedy for pressing evils. It saved Rome from becoming a duchy in the hands of the Tusculan house. But it neither raised the prestige of the papacy, nor could it satisfy the Italians, who rightly regarded the Roman see as theirs. These German popes were short-lived and inefficient. Their appointment, according to notions which defined themselves within the church at this epoch, was simoniacal; and during the long minority of Henry 1V., who succeeded his father in 1056, the terrible Tuscan monk, Hildebrand of Soana, forged weapons which he used with deadly effect against the presumption of the empire. The condition of the church seemed desperate, unless it could be purged of crying scandals—of the subjection of the papacy to the great Roman nobles, of its subordination to the German emperor, and of its internal demoralization. It was Hildebrand’s policy throughout three papacies, during which he controlled the counsels of the Vatican, and before he himself assumed the tiara, to prepare the mind of Italy and Europe for a mighty change. His programme included these three points :—(1) the celibacy of the clergy; (2) the abolition of ecclesiastical appointments made by the secular authority; (3) the vesting of the papal election in the hands of the Roman clergy and people, presided over by the curia of cardinals. How Hildebrand paved the way for these reforms during the pontificates of Nicholas II. and Alexander II., how he succeeded in raising the papal office from the depths of 'degradation and subjection to illimitable sway over the minds of men in Europe, and how his warfare with the empire established on a solid basis the still doubtful independence of the Italian burghs, renewing the long neglected protectorate of the Italian race, and bequeathing to his successors a national policy which had been forgotten by the popes since his great predecessor Gregory II., forms a chapter in European history which must now be interrupted. We have to follow the fortunes of unexpected allies, upon whom in no small measure his success depended.

In order to maintain some thread of continuity through the perplexed and tangled vicissitudes of the Italian race, it has been necessary to disregard those provinces which did not immediately contribute to the formation of its history. For this reason we have left the whole of the south up to the present point unnoticed. Sicily in the hands of the Mussulmans, the Theme of Lombardy abandoned to the weak suzerainty of the Greek catapans, the Lombard duchy of Benevento slowly falling to pieces, and the maritime republics of Naples, Gaeta, and Amalfi extending their influence by commerce in the Mediterranean, were in effect detached from the Italian regno, beyond the jurisdiction of Rome, included in no parcel of Italy proper. But now the moment had arrived when this vast group of provinces, forming the future kingdom of the Two Sicilies, was about to enter definitely and decisively within the bounds of the Italian community. Some Norman adventurers, on pilgrimage to St Michael’s shrine on Monte Gargano, lent their swords in 1017 to the Lombard cities of Apulia against the Greeks. Twelve years later we find the Normans settled at Aversa under their Count Rainulf. From this station as a centre the little band of adventurers, playing the Greeks off against the Lombards, and the Lombards against the Greeks, spread their power in all directions, until they made themselves the most considerable force in southern Italy. William of Hauteville was proclaimed count of Apulia. His half-brother, Robert Wiskard or Guiscard, after defeating the papal troops at Civitella in 1053, received from Leo IX. the investiture of all present and future conquests in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, which he agreed to hold as fiefs of the Holy See. Nicholas II. ratified this grant, and confirmed the title of [9:13:471] count. Having consolidated their possessions on the mainland, the Normans, under Robert Guiscard’s brother, the great Count Roger, undertook the conquest of Sicily iu 10G0. After a prolonged struggle of thirty years, they wrested the whole island from the Saracens; and Roger, dying in 1101, bequeathed to his son Roger a kingdom in Calabria and Sicily second to none in Europe for wealth and magnificence. This while, the elder branch of the Haute ville family still held the title and domains of the Apulian duchy; but in 1127, upon the death of his cousin Duke William, Roger united the whole of the future realm. In 1130 he assumed the style of king of Sicily, inscribing upon his sword the famous hexameter—

Λppulus et Calaber Siculus nιilιi servit et Afer.

This Norman conquest of the two Sicilies forms the most romantic episode in mediaeval Italian history. By the consolidation of Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily into a powerful kingdom, by checking the growth of the maritime republics, and by recognizing the over-lordship of the papal see, the house of Hauteville influenced the destinies of Italy with more effect than any of the princes who had previously dealt with any portion of the peninsula. Their kingdom, though Naples was from time to time separated from Sicily, never quite lost the cohesion they had given it; and all the disturbances of equilibrium in Italy were due in after days to papal manipulation of the rights acquired by RobertGuiscard’s act of homage. The southern regno, in the hands of the popes, proved an insurmountable obstacle to the unification of Italy, led to French interference in Italian affairs, introduced the Spaniard, and maintained in those rich southern provinces the reality of feudal sovereignty long after this alien element had been eliminated from the rest of Italy.

For the sake of clearness, we have anticipated the course of events by nearly a century. We must now return to the date of Hildebrand’s elevation to the papacy in 1073, when he chose the memorable name of Gregory VII. In the next year after his election Hildebrand convened a council, and passed measures enforcing the celibacy of the clergy. In 1075 he caused the investiture of ecclesiastical dignitaries by secular potentates of any degree to be condemned. These two reforms, striking at the most cherished privileges and most deeply-rooted self-indulgences of the aristocratic caste in Europe, inflamed the bitterest hostility. Henry IV., king of Germany, but not crowned emperor, convened a diet in the following year at Worms, where Gregory was deposed and excommunicated. The pope followed with a counter excommunication, far more formidable, releasing the king’s subjects from their oaths of allegiance. War was thus declared between the two chiefs of Western Christendom, that war of investitures which out lasted the lives of both Gregory and Henry, and was not terminated till the year 1122. The dramatic episodes of this struggle are too well known to be enlarged upon. In his single-handed duel with the strength of Germany, Gregory received material assistance from the Countess Matilda of Tuscany. She was the last heiress of the great house of Canossa, whose fiefs stretched from Mantua across Lombardy, passed the Apennines, included the Tuscan plains, and embraced a portion of the duchy of Spoleto. It was in her castle of Canossa that Henry IV. performed his three days’ penance in the winter of 1077; and there she made the cession of her vast domains to the church. That cession, renewed after the death of Gregory to his successors, conferred upon the popes indefinite rights, of which they afterwards availed themselves in the consolidation of their temporal power. Matilda died in the year 1115. Gregory had passed before her from the scene of his contest, an exile at Salerno, whither Robert Wiskard carried him in 1084 from the anarchy of rebellious Rome. With unbroken spirit, though the objects of his life were unattained, though Italy and Europe had been thrown into confusion, and the issue of the conflict was still doubtful, Gregory expired in 1085 with these words on his lips: “I loved justice, I hated iniquity, therefore in banishment I die.”

The greatest of the popes thus breathed his last; but the new spirit he had communicated to the papacy was not destined to expire with him. Gregory’s immediate successors, Victor III., Urban II., and Paschal II., carried on his struggle with Henry IV. and his imperial antipopes, encouraging the emperor’s son to rebel against him, and stirring up Europe for the first crusade. When Henry IV. died, his own son’s prisoner, in 1106, Henry V. crossed the Alps, entered Rome, wrung the imperial coronation from Paschal II., and compelled the pope to -grant his claims on the investitures. Scarcely had he returned to Germany when the Lateran disavowed all that the pope had done, on the score that it had been extorted by force. France sided with the church. Germany rejected the bull of investiture. A new descent into Italy, a new seizure of Rome, proved of no avail. The emperor’s real weakness was in Germany, where his subjects openly expressed their discontent. He at last abandoned the contest which had distracted Europe. By the concordat of Worms, 1122, the emperor surrendered the right of investiture by ring and staff, and granted the right of election to the clergy. The popes were henceforth to be chosen by the cardinals, the bishops by the chapters subject to the pope’s approval. On the other hand the pope ceded to the emperor the right of investiture by the sceptre. But the main issue of the struggle was not in these details of ecclesiastical government; principles had been at stake far deeper and more widely reaching. The respective relations of pope and emperor, ill-defined in the compact between Charles the Great and Leo III., were brought in question, and the two chief potentates of Christendom, no longer tacitly concordant, stood against each other in irreconcilable rivalry. Upon this point, though the battle seemed to be a drawn one, the popes were really victors. They remained independent of the emperor, but the emperor had still to seek the crown at their hands. The pretensions of Otto the Great and Henry III. to make popes were gone for ever.

Age of the Communes.

The final gainers, hθλvever, by the war of investitures were the Italians. In the first place, from this time forward, owing to the election of popes by the Roman curia, the Holy See remained in the hands of Italians; and this, though it was by no means an unmixed good, was a great glory to the nation. In the next place, the antagonism of the popes to the emperors, which became hereditary in the Holy College, forced the former to assume the protectorate of the national cause. But by far the greatest profit the Italians reaped was the emancipation of their burghs. During the forty-seven years’ war, when pope and emperρr were respectively bidding for their alliance, and offering concessions to secure their support, the communes grew in self-reliance, strength, and liberty. As the bishops had helped to free them from subservience to their feudal masters, so the war of investitures relieved them of dependence on their bishops. The age of real autonomy, signalized by the supremacy of consuls in the cities, had arrived.

In the republics, as we begin to know them after the war of investitures, government was carried on by officers called consuls, varying in number according to custom and according to the division of the town into districts. These magistrates, as we have already seen, were originally appointed to control and protect the humbler classes. But, [9:13:472] in proportion as the people gained more power in the field the consuls rose into importance, superseded the bishops, and began to represent the city in transactions with its neighbours. Popes and emperors, who needed the assistance of a city, had to seek it from the consuls, and thus these officers gradually converted an obscure and indefinite authority into what resembles the presidency of a commonwealth. They were supported by a deliberative assembly, called credenza, chosen from the more distinguished citizens. In addition to this privy council, we find a gran Consiglio, consisting of the burghers who had established the right to interfere immediately in public affairs, and a still larger assembly called pαrlamento, which included the whole adult population. Though the institutions of the communes varied in different localities, this is the type to which they all approximated. It will be perceived that the type was rather oligarchical than strictly democratic. Between the parlamento and the consuls with their privy council, or credenza, was interposed the gran consiglio of privileged burghers. These formed the aristocracy of the town, who by their wealth and birth held its affairs within their custody. There is good reason to believe that, when the term popolo occurs, it refers to this body and not to the whole mass of the population. The comune included the entire city—bishop, consuls, oligarchy, councils, handicraftsmen, proletariate. The popolo was the governing or upper class. It was almost inevitable in the transition from feudalism to democracy that this intermediate ground should be traversed; and the peculiar Italian phrases, primo popolo, secondo ρopolo, terzo ρopolo, and so forth, indicate successive changes, whereby the oligarchy passed from one stage to another in its progress toward absorption in democracy or tyranny.

Under their consuls the Italian burghs rose to a great height of prosperity and splendour. Pisa built her Duomo. Milan undertook the irrigation works which enriched the soil of Lombardy for ever. Massive walls, substantial edifices, commodious seaports, good roads, were the benefits conferred by this new’ government on Italy. It is also to be noticed that the people now began to be conscious of their past. They recognized the fact that their blood was Latin as distinguished from Teutonic, and that they must look to ancient Rome for those memories which constitute a people’s nationality. At this epoch the study of Homan law received a new impulse, and this is the real meaning of the legend that Pisa, glorious through her consuls, brought the pandects in a single codex from Amalfi. The very name consul, no less than the Romanizing character of the best architecture of the time, points to the same revival of antiquity.

The rise of the Lombard communes produced a sympathetic revolution in Rome, which deserves to be mentioned in this place. A monk, named Arnold of Brescia, animated with the spirit of the Milanese, stirred up the Romans to shake off the temporal sway of their bishop. He attempted, in fact, upon a grand scale what was being slowly and quietly effected in the northern cities. Rome, ever mindful of her antique past, listened to Arnold’s preaching. A senate was established, and the republic was proclaimed. The title of patrician was revived and offered to Conrad, king of Italy, but not crowned emperor. Conrad refused it, and the Romans conferred it upon one of their own nobles. Though these institutions borrowed high-sounding titles from antiquity, they were in reality imitations of the Lombard civic system. The patrician stood for the consuls. The senate, composed of nobles, represented the credenza and the gran consiglio. The pope was unable to check this revolution, which is now chiefly interesting as further proof of the insurgence of the Latin as against the feudal elements in Italy at this period.

Though the communes gained so much by the war of investitures, the division of the country between the pope’s and emperor’s parties was no small price to pay for independence. It inflicted upon Italy the ineradicable curse of party-warfare, setting city against city, house against house, and-rendering concordant action for a national end impossible. No sooner had the compromise of the investitures been concluded than it was manifest that the burghers of the now enfranchised communes were resolved to turn their arms against each other. We seek in vain an obvious motive for each separate quarrel. All we know for certain is that, at this epoch, Rome attempts to ruin Tivoli, and Venice Pisa; Milan fights with Cremona, Cremona with Crema, Pavia with Verona, Verona with Padua, Piacenza with Parma, Modena and Reggio with Bologna, Bologna and Faenza with Ravenna and Imola, Florence and Pisa with Lucca and Siena, and so on through the whole list of cities. The nearer the neighbours, the more rancorous and internecine is the strife; and, as in all cases where animosity is deadly and no grave local causes of dispute are apparent, we are bound to conclude that some deeply-seated permanent uneasiness goaded these fast growing communities into rivalry. Italy was, in fact, too small for her children. As the towns expanded, they perceived that they must mutually exclude each other. They fought for bare existence, for primacy in commerce, for the command of seaports, for the keys of mountain passes, for rivers, roads, and all the avenues of wealth and plenty. The pope’s cause and the emperor’s cause were of comparatively little moment to Italian burghers; and the names of Guelf and Ghibelline, which before long began to be heard in every street, on every market-place, had no meaning for them. These watchwords are said to have arisen in Germany during the disputed succession of the empire between 1135 and 1152, when the Welfs of Bavaria opposed the Swabian princes of Waiblingen origin. But in Italy, although they were severally identified with the papal and imperial parties, they really served as symbols for jealousies which altered in complexion from time to time and place to place, expressing more than antagonistic political principles, and involving differences vital enough to split the social fabric to its foundation.

Under the imperial rule of Lothar the Saxon (1125-1137) and Conrad the Swabian (1138-1152), these civil wars increased in violence owing to the absence of authority. Neither Lothar nor Conrad was strong at home; the former had no influence in Italy, and the latter never entered Italy at all. But when Conrad died, the electors chose his nephew Frederick, surnamed Barbarossa, who united the rival honours of Welf and Waiblingen, to succeed him; and it was soon obvious that the empire had a master powerful of brain and firm of will. Frederick immediately determined to reassert the imperial rights in his southern provinces, and to check the warfare of the burghs. When he first crossed the Alps in 1154, Lombardy was, roughly speaking, divided between two parties, the one headed by Pavia professing loyalty to the empire, the other headed by Milan ready to oppose its claims. The municipal animosities of the last quarter of a century gave substance to these factions; yet neither the imperial nor the anti-imperial party had any real community of interest with Frederick. He came to supersede self-government by consuls, to deprive the cities of the privilege of making war on their own account, and to extort his regalian rights of forage, food, and lodging for his armies. It was only the habit of interurban jealousy which prevented the communes from at once combining to resist demands which threatened their liberty of action, and would leave them passive at the pleasure of a foreign master. The diet was opened at Roncaglia near Piacenza, where Frederick listened to the [9:13:473] complaints of Como and Lodi against Milan, of Pavia against Tortona, and of the marquis of Montferrat against Asti and Chieri. The plaintiffs in each case were imperialists; and Frederick’s first action was to redress their supposed grievances. He laid waste Chieri, Asti, and Tortona, then took the Lombard crown at Pavia, and, reserving Milan for a future day, passed southward to Rome. Outside the gates of Rome he was met by a deputation from the senate he had come to supersede, who addressed him in words memorable for expressing the republican spirit of new Italy face to face with autocratic feudalism: “Thou wast a stranger, I have made thee a citizen ;” it is Rome who speaks: “Thou camest as an alien from beyond the Alps, I have conferred on thee the principality.” Moved only to scorn and indignation by the rhetoric of these presumptuous enthusiasts, Frederick marched into the Leonine city, and took the imperial crown from the hands of Hadrian IV. In return for this compliance, the emperor delivered over to the pope his troublesome rival Arnold of Brescia, who was burned alive by Nicholas Breakspear, the only English successor of St Pqter. The gates of Rome itself were shut against Frederick; and even on this first occasion his good understanding with Hadrian began to suffer. The points of dispute between them related mainly to Matilda’s bequest, and to the kingdom of Sicily, which the pope had rendered independent of the empire by renewing its investiture in the name of the Holy See. In truth, the papacy and the empire had become irreconcilable. Each claimed illimitable authority, and neither was content to abide within such limits as would have secured a mutual tolerance. Having obtained his coronation, Frederick withdrew to Germany, while Milan prepared herself against the storm which threatened. In the ensuing struggle with the empire, that great city rose to the altitude of patriotic heroism. By their sufferings no less than by their deeds of daring, her citizens showed themselves to be sublime, devoted, and disinterested, winning the purest laurels which give lustre to Italian story. Almost within Frederick’s presence, they rebuilt Tortona, punished Pavia, Lodi, Cremona, and the marquis of Montferrat. Then they fortified the Adda and Ticino, and waited for the emperor’s next descent. He came in 1158 with a large army, overran Lombardy, raised his imperial allies, and sat down before the walls of Milan. Famine forced the burghers to partial obedience, and Frederick held a victorious diet at Roncaglia. Here the jurists of Bologna appeared, armed with their new lore of Roman law, and expounded Justinian’s code in the interests of the German empire. It was now seen how the absolutist doctrines of autocracy developed in Justinian’s age at Byzantium would bear fruits in the development of an imperial idea, which was destined to be the fatal mirage of mediaeval Italy. Frederick placed judges of his own appointment, with the title of podesta, in all the Lombard communes; and this stretch of his authority, while it exacerbated his foes, forced even his friends to join their ranks against him. The war, meanwhile, dragged on. Crema yielded after an heroic siege in 1160, and was abandoned to the cruelty of its fierce rival Cremona. Milan was invested in 1161, starved into capitulation after nine months’ resistance, and given up to total destruction by the Italian imperialists of Frederick’s army. So stained and tarnished with the vindictive passions of municipal rivalry was even this, the one great glorious strife of Italian annals! Having ruined his rebellious city, but not tamed her spirit, Frederick withdrew across the Alps. But, in the interval between his second and third visit, a league was formed against him in north-eastern Lombardy. Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Treviso, Venice entered into a compact to defend their liberties; and when he came again in 1163 with, a brilliant staff of German knights, the imperial cities refused to join his standards. This was the first and ominous sign of a coming change.

Meanwhile the election of Alexander III. to the papacy in 1159 added a powerful ally to the republican party. Opposed by an anti-pope whom the emperor favoured, Alexander found it was his truest policy to rely for support upon the anti-imperialist communes. They in return gladly accepted a champion who lent them the prestige and influence of the church. When Frederick once more crossed the Alps in 1166, he advanced on Rome, and besieged Alexander in the Coliseum. But the affairs of Lombardy left him no leisure to persecute a recalcitrant pontiff. In April 1167 a new league was formed between Cremona, Bergamo, Brescia, Mantua, and Ferrara. In December of the same year this league allied itself with the elder Veronese league, and received the addition of Milan, Lodi, Piacenza, Parma, Modena, and Bologna. The famous league of Lombard cities, styled Concordia in its acts of settlement, was now established. Novara, Vercelli, Como, Asti, and Tortona swelled its ranks; only Pavia and Montferrat remained imperialist between the Alps and Apennines. Frederick fled for his life by the Mont Cenis, and in 1168 the town of Alessandria was erected to keep Pavia and the marquisate in check. In the emperor’s absence, Ravenna, Rimini, Imola, and Forli joined the league, which now called itself the “Society of Venice, Lombardy, the March, Romagna, and Alessandria.” For the fifth time, in 1174, Frederick entered his rebellious dominions. The fortress town of Alessandria stopped his progress with those mud walls contemptuously named “of straw,” while the forces of the league assembled at Modena, and obliged him to raise the siege. In the spring of 1176 Frederick threatened Milan. His army found itself a little to the north of the town near the village of Legnano, when the troops of the city, assisted only by a few allies from Piacenza, Verona, Brescia, Novara, and Vercelli, met and overwhelmed it. The victory was complete. Frederick escaped alone to Pavia, whence he opened negotiations with Alexander. In consequence of these transactions, he was suffered to betake himself unharmed to Venice. Here, as upon neutral ground, the emperor met the pope, and a truce for six years was concluded with the Lombard burghs. Looking back from the vantage-ground of history upon the issue of this long struggle, we are struck with the small results which satisfied the Lombard communes. They had humbled and utterly defeated their foreign lord. They had proved their strength in combination. Yet neither the acts by which their league was ratified nor the terms negotiated for them by their patron Alexander evince the smallest desire of what we now understand as national independence. The name of Italy is never mentioned. The supremacy of the emperor is not called in question. The conception of a permanent confederation, bound together in offensive and defensive alliance for common objects, has not occurred to these hard fighters and stubborn asserters of their civic privileges. All they claim is municipal autonomy; the right to manage their own affairs within the city wall⅛ to fight their battles as they choose, and to follow their several ends unchecked. It is vain to lament that, when they might have now established Italian independence upon a secure basis, they chose local and municipal privileges. Their mutual jealousies, combined with the prestige of the empire, and possibly with the selfishness of the pope, who had secured his own position, and was not likely to foster a national spirit that would have threatened the ecclesiastical supremacy, deprived the Italians of the only great opportunity they ever had of forming themselves into a powerful nation.

When the truce expired in 1183, a permanent peace [9:13:474] was ratified at Constance. The intervening years had been spent by the Lombards, not in consolidating their union, but in attempting to secure special privileges for their several cities. Alessandria della Paglia, glorious by her resistance to the emperor in 1174, had even changed her name to Cesarea! The signatories of the peace of Constance were divided between leaguers and imperialists. On the one side we find Vercelli, Novara, Milan, Lodi, Bergamo, Brescia, Mantua, Verona, Vicenza, Padua, Treviso, Bologna, Faenza, Modena, Reggio, Parma, Piacenza; on the other, Pavia, Genoa, Alba, Cremona, Como, Tortona, Asti, Cesarea. Venice, who had not yet entered the Italian community, is conspicuous by her absence. According to the terms of this treaty, the communes were confirmed in their right of self-government by consuls, and their right of warfare. The emperor retained the supreme courts of appeal within the cities, and his claim for sustenance at their expense when he came into Italy.

The privileges confirmed to the Lombard cities by the peace of Constance were extended to Tuscany, where Florence, having ruined Fiesole, had begun her career of freedom and prosperity. The next great chapter in the history of Italian evolution is the war of the burghs against the nobles. The consular cities were everywhere surrounded by castles; and, though the feudal lords had been weakened by the events of the preceding centuries, they continued to be formidable enemies. It was, for instance, necessary to the well-being of the towns that they should possess territory round their walls, and this had to be wrested from the nobles. We cannot linger over the details of this warfare. It must suffice to say that, partly by mortgaging their property to rich burghers, partly by entering the service of the cities as condottieri, partly by espousing the cause of one town against another, and partly by forced submission after the siege of their strong places, the counts were gradually brought into connexion of dependence on the communes. These, in their turn, forced the nobles to leave their castles, and to reside for at least a portion of each year within the walls. By these measures the counts became citizens, the rural population ceased to rank as serfs, and the Italo-Roman population of the towns absorbed into itself the remnants of Franks, Germans, and other foreign stocks. It would be impossible to exaggerate the importance of this revolution, which ended by destroying the last vestige of feudality, and prepared that common Italian people which afterwards distinguished itself by the creation of European culture. But, like all the vicissitudes of the Italian race, while it was a decided step forward in one direction, it introduced a new source of discord. The associated nobles proved ill neighbours to the peaceable citizens. They fortified their houses, retained their military habits, defied the consuls, and carried on feuds in the streets and squares. The war against the castles became a war against the palaces; and the system of government by consuls proved inefficient to control the clashing elements within the state. This led to the establishment of podestàs, who represented a compromise between two radically hostile parties in the city, and whose business it was to arbitrate and keep the peace between them. Invariably a foreigner, elected for a year with power of life and death and control of the armed force, but subject to a strict account at the expiration of his office, the podestà might be compared to a dictator invested with limited authority. His title was derived from that of Frederick Barbarossa’s judges; but he had no dependence on the empire. The citizens chose him, and voluntarily submitted to his rule. The podestà marks an essentially transitional state in civic government, and his intervention paved the way for despotism.

The thirty years which elapsed between Frederick Barbarossa’s death in 1190 and the coronation of his grandson Frederick II. in 1220 form one of the most momentous epochs in Italian history. Barbarossa, perceiving the advantage that would accrue to his house if he could join the crown of Sicily to that of Germany, and thus deprive the popes of their allies in Lower Italy, procured the marriage of his son Henry VI. to Constance, daughter of King Roger, and heiress of the Hauteville dynasty. When William II., the last monarch of the Norman race, died, Henry VI. claimed that kingdom in his wife’s right, and was recognized in 1194, Three years afterwards he died, leaving a son, Frederick, to the care of Constance, who in her turn died in 1198, bequeathing the young prince, already crowned king of Germany, to the guardianship of Innocent III. It was bold policy to confide Frederick to his greatest enemy and rival; but the pope honourably discharged his duty, until his ward outgrew the years of tutelage, and became a fair mark for ecclesiastical hostility. Frederick’s long minority was occupied by Innocent’s pontificate. Among the principal events of that reign must be reckoned the foundation of the two orders, Franciscan and Dominican, who were destined to form a militia for the Holy See in conflict with the empire and the heretics of Lombardy. A second great event was the fourth crusade, undertaken in 1198, which established the naval and commercial supremacy of the Italians in the Mediterranean. The Venetians, who contracted for the transport of the crusaders, and whose blind doge Dandolo was first to land in Constantinople, received one-half and one-fourth of the divided Greek empire for their spoils. The Venetian ascendency in the Levant dates from this epoch; for, though the republic had no power to occupy all the domains ceded to it, Candia was taken, together with several small islands and stations on the mainland. The formation of a Latin empire in the East increased the pope’s prestige; while at home it was his policy to organize Countess Matilda’s heritage by the formation of Guelf leagues, over which he presided. This is the meaning of the three leagues, in the March, in the duchy of Spoleto, and in Tuscany, which now combined the chief cities of the papal territory into allies of the Holy See. From the Tuscan league Pisa, consistently Ghibelline, stood aloof. Rome itself again at this epoch established a republic, with which Innocent would not or could not interfere. The thirteen districts in their council nominated four caporioni, who acted in concert with a senator, appointed, like the podestà of other cities, for supreme judicial functions. Meanwhile the Guelf and Ghibelline factions were beginning to divide Italy into minute parcels. Not only did commune range itself against commune under the two rival flags, but party rose up against party within the city walls. The introduction of the factions into Florence in 1215, owing to a private quarrel between the Buondelmonti, Amidei, and Donati, is a celebrated instance of what was happening in every burgh.

Frederick II. was left without a rival for the imperial throne in 1218 by the death of Otto IV., and on the 22d of November 1220 Honorius III., Innocent’s successor, crowned him in Rome. It was impossible for any section of the Italians to mistake the gravity of his access to power. In his single person he combined the prestige of empire with the crowns of Italy, Sicily, Sardinia, Germany, and Burgundy; and in 1225, by marriage with Yolande de Brienne, he added that of Jerusalem. There was no prince greater or more formidable in the habitable globe. The communes, no less than the popes, felt that they must prepare themselves for contest to the death with a power which threatened their existence. Already in 1218 the Guelfs of Lombardy had resuscitated their old [9:13:475] league, and had been defeated by the Ghibellines in a battle near Ghibello. Italy seemed to lie prostrate before the emperor, who commanded her for the first time from the south as well as from the north. In 1227 Frederick, who had promised to lead a crusade, was excommunicated by Gregory IX. because he was obliged by illness to defer his undertaking; and thus the spiritual power declared war upon its rival. The Guelf towns of Lombardy again raised their levies. Frederick enlisted his Saracen troops at Nocera and Luceria, and appointed the terrible Ezzelino da Romano his vicar in the Marches of Verona to quell their insurrection. It was 1236, however, before he was able to take the field himself against the Lombards. Having established Ezzelino in Verona, Vicenza, and Padua, he defeated the Milanese and their allies at Cortenuova in 1237, and sent their carroccio as a trophy of his victory to Rome. Gregory IX. feared lest the Guelf party would be ruined by this check. He therefore made alliance with Venice and Genoa, fulminated a new excommunication against Frederick, and convoked a council at Rome to ratify his ban in 1241. The Genoese undertook to bring the French bishops to this council. Their fleet was attacked at’ Meloria by the Pisans, and utterly defeated. The French prelates went in silver chains to prison in the Ghibelline capital of Tuscany. So far Frederick had been successful at all points. In 1243 a new pope, Innocent IV., was elected, who prosecuted the war with still bitterer spirit. Forced to fly to France, he there, at Lyons, in 1245, convened a council, which enforced his condemnation of the emperor. Frederick’s subjects were freed from their allegiance, and he was declared dethroned and deprived of all rights. Five times king and emperor as he was, Frederick, placed under the ban of the church, led henceforth a doomed existence. The mendicant monks stirred up the populace to acts of fanatical enmity. To plot against him, to attempt his life by poison or the sword, was accounted virtuous. His secretary, Piero delle Vigne, conspired against him. The crimes of his vicar Ezzelino, who laid whole provinces waste and murdered men by thousands in his Paduan prisons, increased the horror with which he was regarded. Parma revolted from him, and he spent months in 1247-8 vainly trying to reduce this one time faithful city. The only gleam of success which shone on his ill fortune was the revolution which placed Florence in the hands of the Ghibellines in 1248. Next year Bologna rose against him, defeated his troops, and took his son Enzio, king of Sardinia, prisoner at Fossalta. Hunted to the ground and broken-hearted, Frederick expired at the end of 1250 in his Apulian castle of Fiorentino. It is difficult to judge his career with fairness. The only prince who could, with any probability of success, have established the German rule in Italy, his ruin proved the impossibility of that long-cherished scheme. The nation had outgrown dependence upon foreigners, and after his death no German emperor interfered with anything but miserable failure in Italian affairs. Yet from many points of view it might be regretted that Frederick was not suffered to rule Italy. By birth and breeding an Italian, highly gifted and widely cultivated, liberal in his opinions, a patron of literature, a founder of universities, he anticipated the spirit of the Renaissance. At his court Italian started into being as a language. His laws were wise. He was capable of giving to Italy a large and noble culture. But the commanding greatness of his position proved his ruin. Emperor and king of Sicily, he was the natural enemy of popes, who could not tolerate so overwhelming a rival.

After Frederick’s death, the popes carried on their war for eighteen years against his descendants. The cause of his son Conrad was sustained in Lower Italy by Manfred, one of Frederick’s many natural children; and, when Conrad died in 1254, Manfred still acted as vicegerent for the Swabians, who were now represented by a boy Conradin, Innocent IV. and Alexander IV. continued to make head against the Ghibelline party. The most dramatic incident in this struggle was the crusade preached against Ezzelino. This tyrant had made himself justly odious; and when he was hunted to death in 1259, the triumph was less for the Guelf cause than for humanity outraged by the iniquities of such a monster. The battle between Guelf and Ghibelline raged with unintermitting fury. While the former faction gained in Lombardy by the massacre of Ezzelino, the latter revived in Tuscany after the battle of Montaperti, which in 1260 placed Florence at the discretion of the Ghibellines. Manfred, now called king of Sicily, headed the Ghibellines, and there was no strong counterpoise against him. In this necessity Urban IV. and Clement IV. invited Charles of Anjou to enter Italy and take the Guelf command. They made him senator of Rome, and vicar of Tuscany, and promised him the investiture of the regno provided he stipulated that it should not be held in combination with the empire. Charles accepted these terms, and was welcomed by the Guelf party as their chief throughout Italy. He defeated Manfred in a battle at Grandella near Benevento in 1266. Manfred was killed; and, when Conradin, a lad of sixteen, descended from Germany to make good his claims to the kingdom, he too was defeated at Tagliacozzo in 1267. Less lucky than his uncle, Conradin escaped with his life, to die upon a scaffold at Naples. His glove was carried to his cousin Constance, wife of Peter of Aragon, the last of the great Norman-Swabian family. Enzio died in his prison four years later. The popes had been successful; but they had purchased their bloody victory at a great cost. This first invitation to French princes brought with it incalculable evils.

Charles of Anjou, supported by Rome, and recognized as chief in Tuscany, was by far the most formidable of the Italian potentates. In his turn he now excited the jealousy of the popes, who began, though cautiously, to cast their weight into the Ghibelline scale. Gregory initiated the policy of establishing an equilibrium between the parties, which was carried out by his successor Nicholas III. Charles was forced to resign the senatorship of Rome and the signoria of Lombardy and Tuscany. In 1282 he received a more decided check, when Sicily rose against him in the famous rebellion of the Vespers. He lost the island, which gave itself to Aragon; anti thus the kingdom of Sicily was severed from that of Naples, the dynasty in the one being Spanish and Ghibelline, in the other French and Guelf. Meanwhile a new emperor had been elected, the prudent Rudolf of Hapsburg, who abstained from interference with Italy, and who confirmed the territorial pretensions of the popes by solemn charter in 1278. Henceforth Emilia, Romagna, the March of Ancona, the patrimony of St Peter, and the Campagna of Rome held of the Holy See, and not of the empire. The imperial chancery, without inquiring closely into the deeds furnished by the papal curia, made a deed of gift, which placed the pope in the position of a temporal sovereign. While Nicholas III. thus bettered the position of the church in Italy, the Guelf party grew stronger than ever, through the crushing defeat of the Pisans by the Genoese at Meloria in 1284. Pisa, who had ruined Amalfi, was now ruined by Genoa. She never held her head so high again after this victory, which sent her best and bravest citizens to die in the Ligurian dungeons. The Mediterranean was left to be fought for by Genoa and Venice, while Guelf Florence grew still more powerful in Tuscany. Not long after the battle of Meloria Charles of Anjou died, and was succeeded by his son Charles II. of Naples, who played no prominent [9:13:476] part in Italian affairs. The Guelf party was held together with a less tight hand even in cities so consistent as Florence. Here in the year 1300 new factions, subdividing the old Guelfs and Ghibellines under the names of Neri and Bianchi, had acquired such force that Boniface VIII., a violently Guelf pope, called in Charles of Valois to pacify the republic and undertake the charge of Italian affairs. Boniface was a passionate and unwise man. After quarrelling with the French king, Philip le Bel, he fell into the hands of the Colonna family at Anagni, and died, either of the violence he there received or of mortification, in October 1303.

After the short papacy of Benedict XI. a Frenchman, Clement V., was elected, and the seat of the papacy was transferred to Avignon. Thus began that Babylonian exile of the popes which placed them in subjection to the French crown, and ruined their prestige in Italy. Lasting seventy years, and joining on to the sixty years of the Great Schism, this enfeeblement of the papal authority, coinciding as it did with the practical elimination of the empire from Italian affairs, gave a long period of comparative independence to the nation. Nor must it be forgotten that this exile was due to the policy which induced the pontiffs, in their detestation of Ghibellinism, to rely successively upon the houses of Anjou and of Valois. This policy it was which justified Dante’s fierce epigram—the puttaneggiar co régi.

The period we have briefly traversed was immortalized by Dante in an epic which from one point of view might be called the poem of the Guelfs and Ghibellines. From the foregoing bare narration of events it is impossible to estimate the importance of these parties, or to understand their bearing on subsequent Italian history. We are therefore forced to pause awhile, and probe beneath the surface. The civil wars may be regarded as a continuation of the previous municipal struggle, intensified by recent hostilities between the burghers and the nobles. The quarrels of the church and empire lend pretexts and furnish war-cries; but the real question at issue is not the supremacy of pope or emperor. The conflict is a social one, between civic and feudal institutions, between commercial and military interests, between progress and conservatism. Guelf democracy and industry idealize the pope. The banner of the church waves above the camp of those who aim at positive prosperity and republican equality. Ghibelline aristocracy and immobility idealize the emperor. The prestige of the empire, based upon Roman law and feudal tradition, attracts imaginative patriots and systematic thinkers. The two ideals are counterposed and mutually exclusive. No city calls itself either Guelf or Ghibelline till it has expelled one-half of its inhabitants; for each party is resolved to constitute the state according to its own conception, and the affirmation of the one programme is the negation of the other. The Ghibelline honestly believes that the Guelfs will reduce society to chaos. The Guelf is persuaded that the Ghibellines will annihilate freedom and strangle commerce. The struggle is waged by two sets of men who equally love their city, but who would fain rule it upon diametrically opposite principles, and who fight to the death for its possession. This contradiction enters into the minutest details of life:—armorial bearings, clothes, habits at table, symbolize and accentuate the difference. Meanwhile each party forms its own organization of chiefs, finance-officers, and registrars at home, and sends ambassadors to foreign cities of the same complexion. A network of party policy embraces and dominates the burghs of Italy, bringing the most distant centres into relation, and by the very division of the country augmenting the sense of nationality. The Italians learn through their discords at this epoch that they form one community. The victory in the conflict practically falls to the hitherto unenfranchised plebeians. The elder noble families die out or lose their preponderance. In some cities, as notably in Florence after the date 1292, it becomes criminal to be scioperato, or unemployed in industry. New houses rise into importance; a new commercial aristocracy is formed. Burghers of all denominations are enrolled in one or other of the arts or guilds, and these trading companies furnish the material from which the government or signoria of the city is composed. Plebeian handicrafts assert their right to be represented on an equality with learned professions and wealthy corporations. The ancient classes are confounded and obliterated in a population more homogeneous, more adapted for democracy and despotism.

In addition to the parliament and the councils which have been already enumerated, we now find a council of the party established within the city. This body tends to become a little state within the state, and, by controlling the victorious majority, disposes of the government as it thinks best. The consuls are merged in ancients or priors, chosen from the arts. A new magistrate, the gonfalonier of justice, appears in some of the Guelf cities, with the special duty of keeping the insolence of the nobility in check. Meanwhile the podestà still subsists; but he is no longer equal to the task of maintaining an equilibrium of forces. He sinks more and more into a judge, loses more and more the character of dictator. His ancient place is now occupied by a new functionary, no longer acting as arbiter, but concentrating the forces of the triumphant party. The captain of the people, acting as head of the ascendant Guelfs or Ghibellines, undertakes the responsibility of proscriptions, decides on questions of policy, forms alliances, declares war. Like all officers created to meet an emergency, the limitations to his power are ill-defined, and he is often little better than an autocrat.

Age of the Despots.

Thus the Italians, during the heat of the civil wars, were ostensibly divided between partisans of the empire and partisans of the church. After the death of Frederick II. their affairs were managed by Manfred and by Charles of Anjou, the supreme captains of the parties, under whose orders acted the captains of the people in each city. The contest being carried on by warfare, it followed that these captains in the burghs were chosen on account of military skill; and, since the nobles were men of arms by profession, members of ancient houses took the lead again in towns where they had been absorbed into the bourgeoisie. In this way, after the downfall of the Ezzelini of Romano, the Della Scala dynasty arose in Verona, and the Carraresi in Padua. The Estensi made themselves lords of Ferrara; the Torriani headed the Guelfs of Milan. At Ravenna we find the Polenta family, at Rimini the Malatestas, at Parma the Rossi, at Piacenza the Scotti, at Faenza the Manfredi. There is not a burgh of northern Italy but can trace the rise of a dynastic house to the vicissitudes of this period. In Tuscany, where the Guelf party was very strongly organized, and the commercial constitution of Florence kept the nobility in check, the communes remained as yet free from hereditary masters. Yet generals from time to time arose, the Conte Ugolino della Gheradesca at Pisa, Uguccione della Faggiuola at Lucca, the Conte Guido di Montefeltro at Florence, who threatened the liberties of Tuscan cities with military despotism.

Left to themselves by absentee emperors and exiled popes, the Italians pursued their own course of development unchecked. After the commencement of the 14th century, the civil wars decreased in fury, and at the same time it was perceived that their effect had been to confirm [9:13:477] tyrants in their grasp upon free cities. Growing up out of the captain of the people or signore of the commune, the tyrant annihilated both parties for his own profit and for the peace of the state. He used the dictatorial powers with which he was invested, to place himself above the law, resuming in his person the state-machinery which had preceded him. In him, for the first time, the city attained self-consciousness; the blindly working forces of previous revolutions were combined in the will of a ruler. The tyrant’s general policy was to favour the multitude at the expense of his own caste. He won favour by these means, and completed the levelling down of classes, which had been proceeding ever since the emergence of the communes.

In 1309 Robert, grandson of Charles, the first Angevine sovereign, succeeded to the throne of Naples, and became the leader of the Guelfs in Italy. In the next year Henry VII. of Luxembourg crossed the Alps soon after his election to the empire, and raised the hopes of the Ghibellines. Dante from his mountain solitudes passionately called μpon him to play the part of a Messiah. But it was now impossible for any German to control the “Garden of the Empire.” Italy had entered on a new phase of her existence, and the great poet’s De Monarchia represented a dream of the past which could not be realized. Henry established imperial vicars in the Lombard towns, confirming the tyrants, but gaining nothing for the empire in exchange for the titles he conferred. After receiving the crown in Rome, he died at Buonconvento, a little walled town south of Siena, on his backward journey in 1313. The profits of his inroad were reaped by despots, who used the Ghibelline prestige for the consolidation of their own power. It is from this epoch that the supremacy of the Visconti, hitherto the unsuccessful rivals of the Guelfic Torriani for the signory of Milan, dates. The Scaligers in Verona and the Carraresi in Padua were strengthened; and in Tuscany Castruccio Castracane, Uguccione’s successor at Lucca, became formidable. In 1325 he defeated the Florentines at Alto Pascio, and carried home their carroccio as a trophy of his victory over the Guelfs. Louis of Bavaria, the next emperor, made a similar excursion in the year 1327, with even greater loss of imperial prestige. He deposed Galeazzo Visconti on his downward journey, and offered Milan for a sum of money to his son Azzo upon his return. Castruccio Castracane was nominated by him duke of Lucca; and this is the first instance of a dynastic title conferred upon an Italian adventurer by the emperor. Castruccio dominated Tuscany, where the Guelf cause, in the weakness of King Robert, languished. But the adventurer’s death in 1328 saved the stronghold of republican institutions, and Florence breathed freely for a while again. Can Grande della Scala’s death in the next year inflicted on the Lombard Ghibellines a loss hardly inferior to that of Castruccio’s on their Tuscan allies. Equally contemptible in its political results and void of historical interest was the brief visit of John of Bohemia, son of Henry VII., whom the Ghibellines next invited to assume their leadership. He sold a few privileges, conferred a few titles, and recrossed the Alps in 1333. It is clear that at this time the fury of the civil wars was spent. In spite of repeated efforts on the part of the Ghibellines, in spite of King Robert’s supine incapacity, the imperialists gained no permanent advantage. The Italians were tired of fighting, and the leaders of both factions looked exclusively to their own interests. Each city which had been the cradle of freedom thankfully accepted a master, to quench the conflagration of party strife, encourage trade, and make the handicraftsmen comfortable. Even the Florentines in 1342 submitted for a few months to the despotism of the duke of Athens. They conferred the signory upon him for life; and, had he not mismanaged matters, he might have held the city in his grasp. Italy was settling down and turning her attention to home comforts, arts, and literature. Boccaccio, the contented bourgeois, succeeded to Dante, the fierce aristocrat.

The most marked proof of the change which came over Italy towards the middle of the 14th century is furnished by the companies of adventure. It was with their own militia that the burghers won freedom in the war of independence, subdued the nobles, and fought the battles of the parties. But from this time forward they laid down their arms, and played the game of warfare by the aid of mercenaries. Ecclesiastical overlords, interfering from a distance in Italian politics; prosperous republics, with plenty of money to spend but no leisure or inclination for camp-life; cautious tyrants, glad of every pretext to emasculate their subjects, and courting popularity by exchanging conscription for taxation,—all combined to favour the new system. Mercenary troops are said to have been first levied from disbanded Germans, together with Breton and English adventurers, whom the Visconti and Castruccio took into their pay. They soon appeared under their own captains, who hired them out to the highest bidder, or marched them on marauding expeditions up and down the less protected districts. The names of some of these earliest captains of adventure, Fra Moriale, Count Lando, and Duke Werner, who styled himself the “Enemy of God and Mercy,” have been preserved to us. As the companies grew in size and improved their discipline, it was seen by the Italian nobles that this kind of service offered a good career for men of spirit, who had learned the use of arms. To leave so powerful and profitable a calling in the hands of foreigners seemed both dangerous and uneconomical. Therefore, after the middle of the century, this profession fell into the hands of natives. The first Italian who formed an exclusively Italian company was Alberico da Barbiano, a nobleman of Romagna, and founder of the Milanese house of Belgiojoso. In his school the great condottieri Braccio da Montone and Sforza Attendolo were formed; and henceforth the battles of Italy were fought by Italian generals commanding native troops. This was better in some respects than if the mercenaries had been foreigners. Yet it must not be forgotten that the new companies of adventure, who decided Italian affairs for the next century, were in no sense patriotic. They sold themselves for money, irrespective of the cause which they upheld; and, while changing masters, they had no care for any interests but their own. The name condottiero, derived from condotta, a paid contract to supply so many fighting men in serviceable order, sufficiently indicates the nature of the business. In the hands of able captains, like Francesco Sforza or Piccinino, these mercenary troops became moving despotisms, draining the country of its wealth, and always eager to fasten and found tyrannies upon the provinces they had been summoned to defend. Their generals substituted heavy-armed cavalry for the old militia, and introduced systems of campaigning which reduced the art of war to a game of skill. Battles became all but bloodless; diplomacy and tactics superseded feats of arms and hard blows in pitched fields. In this way the Italians lost their military vigour, and wars were waged by despots from their cabinets, who pulled the strings of puppet captains in their pay. Nor were the people only enfeebled for resistance to a real foe; the whole political spirit of the race was demoralized. The purely selfish bond between condottieri and their employers, whether princes or republics, involved intrigues and treachery, checks and counterchecks, secret terror on the one hand and treasonable practice on the other, which ended by making statecraft in Italy synonymous with perfidy.
[9:13:478]

It must further be noticed that the rise of mercenaries was synchronous with a change in the nature of Italian despotism. The tyrants, as we have already seen, established themselves as captains of the people, vicars of the empire, vicars for the church, leaders of the Guelf and Ghibelline parties. They were accepted by a population eager for repose, who had merged old class distinctions in the conflicts of preceding centuries. They rested in large measure on the favour of the multitude, and pursued a policy of sacrificing to their interests the nobles. It was natural that these self-made princes should seek to secure the peace which they had promised in their cities, by freeing the people from military service and disarming the aristocracy. As their tenure of power grew firmer, they advanced dynastic claims, assumed titles, and took the style of petty sovereigns. Their government became paternal; and, though there was no limit to their cruelty when stung by terror, they used the purse rather than the sword, bribery at home and treasonable intrigue abroad in preference to coercive measures or open war. Thus was elaborated the type of despot which attained completeness in Gian Galeazzo Visconti and Lorenzo de’ Medici. No longer a tyrant of Ezzelino’s stamp, he reigned by intelligence and terrorism masked beneath a smile. He substituted cunning and corruption for violence. The lesser people tolerated him because he extended the power of their city and made it beautiful with public buildings. The bourgeoisie, protected in their trade, found it convenient to support him. The nobles, turned into courtiers, placemen, diplomatists, and men of affairs, ended by preferring his authority to the alternative of democratic institutions. A lethargy of well-being, broken only by the pinch of taxation for war-costs, or by outbursts of frantic ferocity and lust in the less calculating tyrants, descended on the population of cities which had boasted of their freedom. Only Florence and Venice, at the close of the period upon which we are now entering, maintained their republican independence. And Venice was ruled by a close oligarchy; Florence was passing from the hands of her oligarchs into the power of the Medicean merchants.

Between the year 1305, when Clement V. settled at Avignon, and the year 1447, when Nicholas V. re-established the papacy upon a solid basis at Rome, the Italians approximated more nearly to self-government than at any other epoch of their history. The conditions which have been described, of despotism, mercenary warfare, and bourgeois prosperity, determined the character of this epoch, which was also the period when the great achievements of the Renaissance were prepared. At the end of this century and a half, five principal powers divided the peninsula; and their confederated action during the next forty-five years (1447-1492) secured for Italy a season of peace and brilliant prosperity. These five powers were the kingdom of Naples, the duchy of Milan, the republic of Florence, the republic of Venice, and the papacy. The subsequent events of Italian history will be rendered most intelligible if at this point we trace the development of these five constituents of Italian greatness separately.

When Robert of Anjou died in 1343, he was succeeded by his grand-daughter Joan, the childless wife of four successive husbands, Andrew of Hungary, Louis of Taranto, James of Aragon, and Otto of Brunswick. Charles of Durazzo, the last male scion of the Angevine house in Lower Italy, murdered Joan in 1382, and held the kingdom for five years. Dying in 1387, he transmitted Naples to his son Ladislaus, who had no children, and was followed in 1414 by his sister Joan II. She too, though twice married, died without issue, having at one time adopted Louis III. of Provence and his brother René, at another Alfonso V. of Aragon, who inherited the crown of Sicily. After her death in February 1435, the kingdom was fought for between René of Anjou and Alfonso, surnamed the Magnanimous. René found supporters among the Italian princes, especially the Milanese Visconti, who helped him to assert his claims with arms. During the war of succession which ensued, Alfonso was taken prisoner by the Genoese fleet in August 1435, and was sent a prisoner to Filippo Maria at Milan. Here he pleaded his own cause so powerfully, and proved so incontestably the advantage which might ensue to the Visconti from his alliance, if he held the regno, that he obtained his release and recognition as king. From the end of the year 1435 Alfonso reigned alone and undisturbed in Lower Italy, combining for the first time since the year 1282 the crowns of Sicily and Naples. The former he held by inheritance, together with that of Aragon. The latter he considered to be his by conquest. Therefore, when he died in 1458, he bequeathed Naples to his natural son Ferdinand, while Sicily and Aragon passed together to his brother John, and so on to Ferdinand the Catholic. The twenty-three years of Alfonso’s reign were the most prosperous and splendid period of South Italian history. He became an Italian in taste and sympathy, entering with enthusiasm into the humanistic ardour of the earlier Renaissance, encouraging men of letters at his court, administering his kingdom on the principles of an enlightened despotism, and lending his authority to establish that equilibrium in the peninsula upon which the politicians of his age believed, not without reason, that Italian independence might be secured.

The last member of the Visconti family of whom we] had occasion to speak was Azzo, who bought the city in 1328 from Louis of Bavaria. His uncle Lucchino succeeded, but was murdered in 1349 by a wife against whose life he had been plotting. Lucchino’s brother John, archbishop of Milan, now assumed the lordship of the city, and extended the power of the Visconti over Genoa and the whole of North Italy, with the exception of Piedmont, Verona, Mantua, Ferrara, and Venice. The greatness of the family dates from the reign of this masterful prelate. He died in 1354, and his heritage was divided between three members of his house, Matteo, Bernabo, and Galeazzo. In the next year Matteo, being judged incompetent to rule, was assassinated by order of his brothers, who made an equal partition of their subject cities,—Bernabo residing in Milan, Galeazzo in Pavia. Galeazzo was the wealthiest and most magnificent Italian of his epoch. He married his daughter Violante to our duke of Clarence, and his son Gian Galeazzo to a daughter of King John of France. When he died in 1378, this son resolved to reunite the domains of the Visconti; and, with this object in view, he plotted and executed the murder of his uncle Bernabo. Gian Galeazzo thus became by one stroke the most formidable of Italian despots. Immured in his castle at Pavia, accumulating wealth by systematic taxation and methodical economy, he organized the mercenary troops who eagerly took service under so good a paymaster; and, by directing their operations from his cabinet, he threatened the whole of Italy with conquest. The last scions of the Della Scala family still reigned in Verona, the last Carraresi in Padua; the Estensi were powerful in Ferrara, the Gonzaghi in Mantua. Gian Galeazzo, partly by force and partly by intrigue, discredited these minor despots, pushed his dominion to the very verge of Venice, and, having subjected Lombardy to his sway, proceeded to attack Tuscany. Pisa and Perugia were threatened with extinction, and Florence dreaded the advance of the Visconti arms, when the plague suddenly cut short his career of treachery and conquest in the year 1402. Seven years before his death Gian Galeazzo bought the title of duke of Milan and count of Pavia from [9:13:479] the emperor Wenceslaus, and there is no doubt that he ⅛vas aiming at the sovereignty of Italy. But no sooner was he dead than the essential weakness of an artificial state, built up by cunning and perfidious policy, with the lid of bought troops, dignified by no dynastic title, and jonsolidated by no sense of loyalty, became apparent. Gian Galeazzo’s duchy was a masterpiece of mechanical contrivance, the creation of a scheming intellect and lawless will. When the mind which had planned it was withdrawn, it fell to pieces, and the very hands which had been used to build it helped to scatter its fragments. The Visconti’s own generals, Facino Cane, Pandolfo Malatesta, Jacopo dal Verme, Gabrino Fondulo, Ottobon Terzo, seized upon the tyranny of several Lombard cities. In others the petty tyrants whom the Visconti had uprooted reappeared. The Estensi recovered their grasp upon Ferrara, and the Gonzaghi upon Mantua. Venice strengthened herself between the Adriatic and the Alps. Florence reassumed her Tuscan hegemony. Other communes which still preserved the shadow of independence, like Perugia and Bologna, began once more to dream of republican freedom under their own leading families. Meanwhile Gian Galeazzo had left two sons, Giovanni Maria and Filippo Maria. Giovanni, a monster of cruelty and lust, was assassinated by some Milanese nobles in 1412; and now Filippo set about rebuilding his father’s duchy. Herein he was aided by the troops of Facino Cane, who, dying opportunely at this period, left considerable wealth, a well-trained band of mercenaries, and a widow, Beatrice di Tenda. Filippo married and then beheaded Beatrice after a mock trial for adultery, having used her money'^and her influence in reuniting several subject cities to the crown of Milan. He subsequently spent a long, suspicious, secret, and incomprehensible career in the attempt to piece together Gian Galeazzo’s Lombard state, and to carry out his schemes of Italian conquest. In this endeavour he met with vigorous opponents. Venice and Florence, strong in the strength of their resentful oligarchies, offered a determined resistance; nor vzas Filippo equal in ability to his father. His infernal cunning often defeated its own aims, checkmating him at the point of achievement by suggestions of duplicity or terror. In the course of Filippo’s wars with Florence and Venice, the greatest generals of this age were formed—Francesco Carmagnola, who was beheaded between the columns at Venice in 1432; Niccolo Piccinino, who died at Milan in 1444; and Francesco Sforza, who survived to seize his master’s heritage in 1450. Son of Attendolo Sforza, this Francesco received the hand of Filippo’s natural daughter, Bianca, as a reward for past service and a pledge of future support. When the Visconti dynasty ended by the duke’s death in 1447, he pretended to espouse the cause of the Milanese republic, which was then reestablished; but he played his cards so subtly as to make himself, by the help of Cosimo de’ Medici in Florence, duke de facto if not de jure. Francesco Sforza was the only condottiero among many aspiring to be tyrants who planted himself firmly on a throne of first-rate importance. Once seated in the duchy of Milan, he displayed rare qualities as a ruler; for he not only entered into the spirit of the age, which required humanity and culture from a despot, but he also knew how to curb his desire for territory. The conception of confederated Italy found in him a vigorous supporter. Thus the limitation of the Milanese duchy under Filippo Maria Visconti, and its consolidation under Francesco Sforza, were equally effectual in preparing the balance of power to which Italian politics now tended.

This balance could not have been established without the concurrent aid of Florence. After the expulsion of the duke of Athens in 1343, and the great plague of 1348, the Florentine proletariate rose up against the merchant princes. This insurgence of the artisans, in a republic which had been remodelled upon economical principles by Giano della Bella’s constitution of 1292, reached a climax in 1378, when the Ciompi rebellion placed the city for a few years in the hands of the Lesser Arts. The revolution was but temporary, and was rather a symptom of democratic tendencies in the state than the sign of any capacity for government on the part of the working classes. The necessities of war and foreign affairs soon placed Florence in the power of an oligarchy headed by the great Albizzi family. They fought the battles of the republic with success against the Visconti, and widely extended the Florentine domain over the Tuscan cities. During their season of ascendency Pisa was enslaved, and Florence gained the access to the sea. But throughout this period a powerful opposition was gathering strength. It was led by the Medici, who sided with the common people, and increased their political importance by the accumulation and wise employment of vast ^commercial wealth. In 1433 the Albizzi and the Medici came to open strife. Cosimo de’ Medici, the chief of the opposition, was exiled to Venice. In the next year he returned, assumed the presidency of the democratic party, and by a system of corruption and popularity-hunting, combined with the patronage of arts and letters, established himself as the real but unacknowledged dictator of the commonwealth. Cosimo abandoned the policy of his predecessors. Instead of opposing Francesco Sforza in Milan, he lent him his prestige and influence, foreseeing that the dynastic future of his own family and the pacification of Italy might be secured by a balance of power in which Florence should rank on equal terms with Milan and Naples.

The republic of Venice differed essentially from any other state in Italy; and her history was so separate that, up to this point, it would have been needless to interrupt the narrative by tracing it. Venice, however, in the 14th century took her place at last as an Italian power on an equality at least with the very greatest. The constitution of the commonwealth had slowly matured itself through a series of revolutions, which confirmed and defined a type of singular stability. During the earlier days of the republic the doge had been a prince elected by the people, and answerable only to the popular assemblies. In 1032 he was obliged to act in concert with a senate, called pre-gadi∖ andin 1172 the grand council, which became the real sovereign of the state, was formed. The several steps whereby the members of the grand council succeeded in eliminating the people from a share in the government, and reducing the doge to the position of their ornamental representative, cannot here be described. It must suffice to say that these changes culminated in 1297, w∙hen an act was passed for closing the grand council, or in other words for confining it to a fixed number of privileged families, in whom the government was henceforth vested by hereditary right. This ratification of the oligarchical principle, together with the establishment in 1311 of the Council ρ∙f Ten, completed that famous constitution which endured till the extinction of the republic in 1797. Meanwhile, throughout the Middle Ages, it had been the policy of Venice to refrain from conquests on the Italian mainland, and to confine her energies to commerce in the East. The first entry of any moment made by the Venetians into strictly Italian affairs was in 1336, when the republics of Florence and St Mark allied themselves against Mastino della Scala, and the latter took possession of Treviso. After this, for thirty years, between 1352 and 1381, Venice and Genoa contested the supremacy of the Mediterranean. Pisa’s maritime power having been extinguished in the battle of Meloria (1284), the two [9:13:480] surviving republics had no rivals. They fought their duel out upon the Bosphorus, off Sardinia, and in the Morea, with various success. From the first great encounter, in 1355, Venice retired well-nigh exhausted, and Genoa was so crippled that she placed herself under the protection of the Visconti. The second and decisive battle was fought upon the Adriatic. The Genoese fleet under Luciano Doria defeated the Venetians off Pola in 1379, and sailed without opposition to Chioggia, which was stormed and taken. Thus the Venetians found themselves blockaded in their own lagoons. Meanwhile a fleet was raised for their relief by Carlo Zeno in the Levant, and the admiral Vittore Pisani, who had been imprisoned after the defeat at Pola, was released to lead their forlorn hope from the city side. The Genoese in their turn were now blockaded in Chioggia, and forced by famine to surrender. The losses of men and money which the war of Chioggia, as it was called, entailed, though they did not immediately depress the spirit of the Genoese republic, signed her naval ruin. During this second struggle to the death with Genoa, the Venetians had been also at strife with the Carraresi of Padua and the Scaligers of Verona. In 1406, after the extinction of these princely houses they added Verona, Vicenza, and Padua to the territories they claimed on terra firma. Their career of conquest, and their new policy of forming Italian alliances and entering into the management of Italian affairs, were confirmed by the long dogeship of Francesco Foscari (1423-1457), who must rank with Alfonso, Cosimo de’ Medici, Francesco Sforza, and Nicholas V., as a joint-founder of confederated Italy. When Constantinople fell in 1453, the old ties between Venice and the Eastern empire were broken, and she now entered on a wholly new phase of her history. Ranking as one of the five Italian powers, she was also destined to defend Western Christendom against the encroachments of the Turk in Europe.

By their settlement in Avignon, the popes relinquished their protectorate of Italian liberties, and lost their position as Italian potentates. Rienzi’s revolution in Rome (1347-1354), and his establishment of a republic upon a fantastic basis, half classical half feudal, proved the temper of the times; while the rise of dynastic families in the cities of the church, claiming the title of papal vicars, but acting in their own interests, weakened the authority of the Holy See. The predatory expeditions of Bertrand du Poiet and Robert of Geneva were as ineffective as the descents of the emperors; and, though the cardinal Albornoz conquered Romagna and the March in 1364, the legates who resided in those districts were not long able to hold them against their despots. At last Gregory XI. returned to Rome; and Urban VI., elected in 1378, put a final end to the Avignonian exile. Still the Great Schism, which now distracted western Christendom, so enfeebled the papacy, and kept the Roman pontiffs so engaged in ecclesiastical disputes, that they had neither power nor leisure to occupy themselves seriously with their temporal affairs. The threatening presence of the two princely houses of Orsini and Colonna, alike dangerous as friends or foes, rendered Rome an unsafe residence. Even when the schism was nominally terminated in 1415 by the council of Constance, the next two popes held but a precarious grasp upon their Italian domains. Martin V. (1417-1431) resided principally at Florence. Eugenius IV. (1431-1447) followed his example. And what Martin managed to regain Eugenius lost. At the same time, the change^which had now come over Italian politics, the desire on all sides for a settlement, and the growing conviction that a federation was necessary, proved advantageous to the popes as sovereigns. They gradually entered into the spirit of their age, assumed the style of despots, and made use of the humanistic movement, then at its height, to place themselves in a new relation to Italy. The election of Nicholas V. in 1447 determined this revolution in the papacy, and opened a period of temporal splendour, which ended with the establishment of the popes as sovereigns. Thomas of Sarzana was a distinguished humanist. Humbly born, he had been tutor in the house of the Albizzi, and afterwards librarian of the Medici at Florence, where he imbibed the politics together with the culture of the Renaissance. Soon after assuming the tiara, he found himself without a rival in the church; for the schism ended by Felix V.’s resignation in 1449. Nicholas fixed his residence in Rome, which he began to rebuild and to fortify, determining to render the Eternal City once more a capital worthy of its high place in Europe. The Romans were flattered; and, though his reign was disturbed by republican conspiracy, Nicholas V. was able before his death in 1455 to secure the modern status of the pontiff as a splendid patron and a wealthy temporal potentate.

Italy was now for a brief space independent. The humanistic movement had created a common culture, a common language, and sense of common nationality. The five great powers, with their satellites—dukes of Savoy and Urbino, marquises of Ferrara and Mantua, republics of Bologna, Perugia, Siena—were constituted. All political institutions tended toward despotism. The Medici became yearly more indispensable to Florence, the Bentivogli more autocratic in Bologna, the Baglioni in Perugia; and even Siena was ruled by the Petrucci. But this despotism was of a mild type. The princes were Italians; they shared the common enthusiasms of the nation for art, learning, literature, and science; they studied how to mask their tyranny with arts agreeable to the multitude. When Italy had reached this point, Constantinople was taken by the Turks. On all sides it was felt that the Italian alliance must be tightened; and one of the last, best acts of Nicholas V.’s pontificate was the appeal in 1453 to the five great powers in federation. As regards their common opposition to the Turk, this appeal led to nothing; but it marked the growth of a new Italian consciousness.'

Between 1453 and 1492 Italy continued to be prosperous and tranquil. Nearly all wars during this period were undertaken either to check the growing power of Venice or to further the ambition of the papacy. Having become despots, the popes sought to establish their relatives in principalities. The word nepotism acquired new significance in the reigns of Sixtus IV. and Innocent VIII. Though the country was convulsed by no great struggle, these forty years witnessed a truly appalling increase of political crime. To be a prince was tantamount to being the mark of secret conspiracy and assassination. Among the most noteworthy examples of such attempts may be mentioned the revolt of the barons against Ferdinand I. of Naples (1464), the murder of Galeazzo Maria Sforza at Milan (1476), and the plot of the Pazzi to destroy the Medici (1478). After Cosimo de’Medici’s death in 1464, the presidency of the Florentine republic passed to his son Piero, who left it in 1469 to his sons Lorenzo and Giuliano. These youths assumed the style of princes, and it was against their lives that the Pazzi, with the sanction of Sixtus IV., aimed their blow. Giuliano was murdered. Lorenzo escaped, to tighten his grasp upon the city, which now loved him and was proud of him. During the following fourteen years of his brilliant career, he made himself absolute master of Florence, and so modified her institutions that the Medici were henceforth necessary to the state. Apprehending the importance of Italian federation, Lorenzo, by his personal tact and prudent leadership of the republic, secured peace and a common intelligence between the five powers. His own family was fortified by the [9:13:481] marriage of his daughter to a son of Innocent VIII., which procured his son Giovanni’s elevation to the cardinalate, and involved two Medicean papacies and the future dependence of Florence upon Rome.

Age of Invasions. i The year 1492 opened a new age for Italy. In this year Lorenzo died, and was succeeded by his son, the vain and weak Piero; France passed beneath the personal control of the inexperienced Charles VIII.; the fall of Granada freed Spain from her embarrassments; Columbus discovered America, destroying the commercial supremacy of Venice; last, but not least, Roderigo Borgia assumed the tiara with the famous title of Alexander VI. In this year the short-lived federation of the five powers was shaken, and Italy was once more drawn into the vortex of European affairs. The events which led to this disaster may be briefly told. After Galeazzo Maria’s assassination, his crown passed to a boy, Gian Galeazzo, who was in due course married to a grand-daughter of Ferdinand I. of Naples. But the government of Milan remained in the hands of this youth’s uncle, Lodovico, surnamed II Moro. Lodovico resolved to become duke of Milan. The king of Naples was his natural enemy, and he had cause to suspect that Piero de’ Medici might abandon his alliance. Feeling himself alone, with no right to the title he was bent on seizing, he had recourse to Charles VIII. of France, whom he urged to make good his claim to the kingdom of Naples. This claim, it may be said in passing, rested on the will of King René of Anjou. After some hesitation, Charles agreed to invade Italy. He crossed the Alps in 1494, passed through Lombardy, entered Tuscany, freed Pisa from the yoke of Florence, witnessed the expulsion of the Medici, marched to Naples, and was crowned there;—all this without striking a blow. Meanwhile Lodovico procured his nephew’s death, and raised a league against the French in Lombardy. Charles hurried back from Naples, and narrowly escaped destruction at Fornovo in the passes of the Apennines. He made good his retreat, however, and returned to France in 1495. Little remained to him of his light acquisitions; but he had convulsed Italy by this invasion, destroyed her equilibrium, exposed her military weakness and political disunion, and revealed her wealth to greedy and more powerful nations.

The princes of the house of Aragon, now represented by Frederick, a son of Ferdinand I., returned to Naples. Florence made herself a republic, adopting a form of constitution analogous to that of Venice. At this crisis she was ruled by the monk Girolamo Savonarola, who inspired the people with a thirst for freedom, preached the necessity of reformation, and placed himself in direct antagonism to Rome. After a short but eventful career, the influence of which was long effective, he lost his hold upon the citizens. Alexander VI. procured a mock trial, and his enemies burned him upon the Piazza in 1498. In this year Louis XII. succeeded Charles VIII. upon the throne of France. As duke of Orleans he had certain claims to Milan through his grandmother Valentina, daughter of Gian Galeazzo, the first duke. They were not valid, for the investiture of the duchy had been granted only to male heirs. But they served as a sufficient pretext, and in 1499 Louis entered and subdued the Milanese. Lodovico escaped to Germany, returned the next year, was betrayed by his Swiss mercenaries, and sent to die at Loches in France. In 1501 Louis made the blunder of calling Ferdinand the Catholic to help him in the conquest of Naples. By a treaty signed at Granada, the French and Spanish kings were to divide the spoil. The conquest was easy; but, when it came to a partition, Ferdinand played his ally false. He made himself supreme over the Two Sicilies, which he now reunited under a single crown. Three years later, unlessoned by this experience, Louis signed the treaty of Blois (1504), whereby he invited the emperor Maximilian to aid ħim in the subjugation of Venice. No policy could have been less far-sighted; for Charles V., joint heir to Austria, Burgundy, Castile, and Aragon, the future overwhelming rival of France, was already born.

The stage was now prepared, and all the actors who were destined to accomplish the ruin of Italy trod it with their armies. Spain, France, Germany, with their Swiss auxiliaries, had been summoned upon various pretexts to partake her provinces. Then, too late, patriots like Machiavelli perceived the suicidal self-indulgence of the past, which, by substituting mercenary troops for national militias, left the Italians at the absolute discretion of their neighbours. Whatever parts the Italians themselves played in the succeeding quarter of a century, the game was in the hands of French, Spanish, and German invaders. Meanwhile, no scheme for combination against common foes arose in the peninsula. Each petty potentate strove for his own private advantage in the confusion; and at this epoch the chief gains accrued to the papacy. Aided by his terrible son, Cesare Borgia, Alexander VI. chastised the Roman nobles, subdued Romagna and the March, threatened Tuscany, and seemed to be upon the point of creating a Central Italian state in favour of his progeny, when he died suddenly in 1503. His conquests reverted to the Holy See. Julius II., his bitterest enemy and powerful successor, continued Alexander’s policy, but no longer in the interest of his own relatives. It became the nobler ambition of Julius to aggrandize the church, and to reassume the protectorate of the Italian people. With this object, he secured Emilia, carried his victorious arms against Ferrara, and curbed the tyranny of the Baglioni in Perugia. Julius II. played a perilous game; but the stakes were high, and he fancied himself strong enough to guide the tempest he evoked. Quarrelling with the Venetians in 1508, he combined the forces of all Europe by the league of Cambray against them; and, when he had succeeded in his first purpose of humbling them even to the dust, he turned round in 1510, uttered his famous resolve to expel the barbarians from Italy, and pitted the Spaniards against the French. It was with the Swiss that he hoped to effect this revolution; but the Swiss, now interfering for the first time as principals in Italian affairs, were incapable of more than adding to the already maddening distractions of the people. Formed for mercenary warfare, they proved a perilous instrument in the hands of those who used them, and were hardly less injurious to their friends than to their foes. In 1512 the battle of Ravenna between the French troops and the allies of Julius,—Spaniards, Venetians, and Swiss,—was fought. Gaston de Foix bought a doubtful victory dearly with his death; and the allies, though beaten on the banks of the Ronco, immediately afterwards expelled the French from Lombardy. Yet Julius II. had failed, as might have been foreseen. He only exchanged one set of foreign masters for another, and taught a new barbarian race how pleasant were the plains of Italy. As a v consequence of the battle of Ravenna, the Medici returned in 1512 to Florence.

When Leo X. was elected in 1513, Rome and Florence rejoiced; but Italy had no repose. Louis XII. had lost the game, and the Spaniards were triumphant. But new actors appeared upon the scene, and the same old struggle was resumed with fiercer energy. By the victory of Marignano in 1515 Francis I., having now succeeded to the throne of France, regained the Milanese, and broke the power of the Swiss, who held it for Massimiliano Sforza, the titular duke. Leo for a while relied on Francis; for the vast do wer of Charles V., who succeeded to the empire [9:13:482] in 1519, as in 1516 he had succeeded to the crowns of Spain and Lower Italy, threatened the whole of Europe. It was Leo’s nature, however, to be inconstant. In 1521 he changed sides, allied himself to Charles, and died after hearing that the imperial troops had again expelled the French from Milan. During the next four years the Franco-Spanish war dragged on in Lombardy until the decisive battle of Pavia in 1525, when Francis was taken prisoner, and Italy lay open to the Spanish armies. Meanwhile Leo X. had been followed by Adrian VI., and Adrian by Clement VII., of the house of Medici, who had long ruled Florence. In the reign of this pope Francis was released from his prison in Madrid (1526), and Clement hoped that he might still be used in the Italian interest as a counterpoise to Charles. It is impossible in this place to follow the tangled intrigues of that period. The year 1527 was signalized by the famous sack of Rome. An army of mixed German and Spanish troops, pretending to act for the emperor, but which may rather be regarded as a vast marauding party, entered Italy under their leader Frundsberg. After his death, the Constable de Bourbon took command of them; they marched slowly down, aided by the marquis of Ferrara, and unopposed by the duke of Urbino, reached Rome, and took it by assault. The constable was killed in the first onslaught; Clement was imprisoned in the castle of St Angelo; Rome was abandoned to the rage of 30,000 ruffians. As an immediate result of this catastrophe, Florence shook off the Medici, and established a republic. But Clement, having made peace with the emperor, turned the remnants of the army which had sacked Rome against his native city. After a desperate resistance, Florence fell in 1530. Alessandro de’ Medici was placed there with the title of duke of Cività di Penna; and, on his murder in 1537, Cosimo de’ Medici, of the younger branch of the ruling' house, was made duke. Acting as lieutenant for the Spaniards, he subsequently (1555) subdued Siena, and bequeathed to his descendants the grand-duchy of Tuscany.

Spanislι-A ustriaη Ascendency.

It was high time, after the sack of Rome in 1527, that Charles V. should undertake Italian affairs. The country was exposed to anarchy, of which this had been the last and most disgraceful example. The Turks were threatening Western Europe, and Luther was inflaming Germany. By the treaty of Barcelona in 1529 the pope and emperor made terms. By that of Cambray in the same year France relinquished Italy to Spain. Charles then entered the port of Genoa, and on the 5th of November met Clement VΠ. at Bologna. He there received the imperial crown, and summoned the Italian princes for a settlement of all disputed claims. Francesco Sforza, the last and childless heir of the ducal house, was left in Milan till his death, which happened in 1535. The republic of Venice was respected in her liberties and Lombard territories. The Este family received a confirmation of their duchy of Modena and Reggio, and were invested in their fief of Ferrara by the pope. The marquisate of Mantua was made a duchy; and Florence was secured, as we have seen, to the Medici. The great gainer by this settlement was the papacy, which held the most substantial Italian province, together with a prestige that raised it far above all rivalry. The rest of Italy, however parcelled, henceforth became but a dependence upon Spain. Charles V., it must be remembered, achieved his conquest and confirmed his authority far less as emperor than as the heir of Castile and Aragon. A Spanish viceroy in Milan and another in Naples, supported by Rome and by the minor princes who followed the policy dictated to them from Madrid, were sufficient to preserve the whole peninsula in a state of somnolent inglorious servitude.

From 1530 until 1796, that is, for a period of nearly three centuries, the Italians had no history of their own. Their annals are filled with records of dynastic changes and redistributions of territory, consequent upon treaties signed by foreign powers, in the settlement of quarrels which no wise concerned the people. Italy only too often became the theatre of desolating and distracting wars. But these wars were fought for the most part by alien armies; the points at issue were decided beyond the Alps; the gains accrued to royal families whose names were unpronounceable by southern tongues. The affairs of Europe during the years when Hapsburg and Bourbon fought their domestic battles with the blood of noble races may teach grave lessons to all thoughtful men of our days, but none bitterer, none fraught with more insulting recollections, than to the Italian people, who w∙ere haggled over like dumb driven cattle in the mart of chaffering kings. We cannot wholly acquit the Italians of their share of blame. When they might have won national independence, after their warfare with the Swabian emperors, they let the golden opportunity slip. Pampered with commercial prosperity, eaten to the core with inter-urban rivalries, they submitted to despots, renounced the use of arms, and offered themselves, in the hour of need, defenceless and disunited to the shock of puissant nations. That they had created modern civilization for Europe availed them nothing. Italy, intellectually first among the peoples, was now politically and practically last; and nothing to her historian is more heart-rending than to watch the gradual extinction of her spirit in this age of slavery.

In 1534 Alessandro Farnese, who owed his elevation to his sister Giulia, one of Alexander VI.’s mistresses, took the tiara with the title of Paul III. It was his ambition to create a duchy for his family; and with this object he gave Parma and Piacenza to his son Pier Luigi. After much wrangling between the French and Spanish parties, the duchy was confirmed in 1586 to Ottaviano Farnese and his son Alessandro, better known as Philip H.’s general, the prince of Parma. Alessandro’s descendants reigned in Parma and Piacenza till the year 1731. Paul III.’s pontificate was further marked by important changes in the church, all of which confirmed the spiritual autocracy of Rome. In 1540 this pope approved of Loyola’s foundation, and secured the powerful militia of the Jesuit order. The Inquisition was established with almost unlimited powers in Italy, and the press was placed under its jurisdiction. Thus free thought received a check, by which not only ecclesiastical but political tyrants knew how to profit. Henceforth it was impossible to publish or to utter a word which might offend the despots of church or state; and the Italians had to amuse their leisure with the polite triflings of academics. In 1545 a council was opened at Trent for the reformation of church discipline and the promulgation of orthodox doctrine. The decrees of this council defined Roman Catholicism against the Reformation; and, while failing to regenerate morality, they enforced a hypocritical observance of public decency. Italy to outer view put forth blossoms of hectic and hysterical piety, though at the core her clergy and her aristocracy were more corrupt than ever.

In 1556 Philip II., by the abdication of his father Charles V., became king of Spain. He already wore the crown of the Two Sicilies, and ruled the duchy of Milan. In the next year Ferdinand, brother of Charles, was elected emperor. The French, meanwhile, had not entirely abandoned their claims on Italy. Gian Pietro Caraffa, who was made pope in 1555 with the name of Paul IV., endeavoured to revive the ancient papal policy of leaning upon France. He encouraged the duke of Guise to undertake the conquest of Naples, as Charles of Anjou had been [9:13:483] summoned by his predecessors. But such schemes were now obsolete and anachronistic. They led to a languid lingering Italian campaign, which was settled far beyond the Alps by Philip’s victories over the French at St Quentin and Gravelines. The peace of Câteau Caιnbresis, signed in 1559, left the Spanish monarch undisputed lord of Italy. Of free commonwealths there now survived only Venice, which, together with Spain, achieved for Europe the victory of Lepanto in 1573; Genoa, which, after the ineffectual Fieschi revolution in 1547, abode beneath the rule of the great Doria family, and held a feeble sway in Corsica; and the two insignificant republics of Lucca and San Marino.

The future hope of Italy, however, was growing in a remote and hitherto neglected corner. A clause in the treaty of Câteau Cambresis recognized the right of Emmanuele Filiberto, duke of Savoy, to Piedmont. He owed this recognition, as Alessandro owed his duchy of Parma, to the fact that he was one of Philip’s bravest generals. Yet Emmanuele Filiberto represented the oldest and not the least illustrious reigning house in Europe, and his descendants were destined to achieve for Italy the independence which no other power or prince had given her since the fall of ancient Rome. It is therefore needful at this point to trace the history cf the counts of Savoy from the date of their first emergence on the stage of Italian politics.

In the 10th century the founders of the house of Savoy were masters over Burgundy and Western Lombardy. Their provinces stretched beyond what is now called Savoy on the west and north, and southward touched the Mediterranean at Savona. In the course of the next two centuries the family divided. Its elder branch ruled Savoy and the northern shores of Lake Geneva. The younger line held Piedmont with the city of Turin for capital. The former were frequently at war with the dauphins of Vienne and the house of Hapsburg, seeking to extend their domains in the direction of Switzerland and Provence. The latter proved but ill neighbours to the marquises of Montferrat and Saluzzo. When the first league of the Swiss was formed, the counts of Savoy were vigorously driven back within their northern borders. At the same time the powers of France repelled them from Provence. Entrenched within their mountains, they now looked towards Italy for expansion. This southward growth of a state which had hitherto been undefined between its cisalpine and transalpine provinces was further determined by the union of the two branches of the family in the person of Amadeus Λ r III. Succeeding to the honours of the elder line in 1391, he joined Piedmont to Savoy in 1418, and received the title of duke from the emperor Sigismund. During his lifetime he annexed Saluzzo, took Chivasso from Montferrat, and received Vercelli from Filippo Maria Visconti. Nice had already joined itself to Savoy in 1388. The duchy of Savoy, checked in its development upon the further side of the Alpine barrier, gained in solidity and extent upon the south, and took rank definitely from this time forward as a considerable Italian power. Amadeus was one of the most remarkable personages of his day. Having built up the fortunes of his house by diplomatic ability in an age of policy and intrigue, he abdicated in 1434, and went into cloistral retirement at Ripaille. Hence he emerged in 1440 to receive the papal tiara from the council of Basel. He took the name of Felix V., but resigned in 1449, leaving Nicholas V. sole pope. When he died in 1451, he had reigned for sixty-one years as count, duke, prior of a hermit convent, anti-pope, and dean of the Holy College. The immediate successors of Amadeus VIII. undid a great deal of his work. They entered into unprofitable warfare with Geneva, Freiburg, Bern, and Vaud, and were still further shorn of territory and prestige upon the side of Switzerland. The French invaded Savoy, and their Lombard domains became the theatre of the Franco-Spanish wars. When Emmanuele Filiberto succeeded to his father Charles III. in 1553, he was a duke without a duchy. But the princes of the house of Savoy were a race of warriors; and what Emmanuele Filiberto lost as sovereign he regained as captain of adventure in the service of his cousin Philip II. The treaty of Câteau Cambresis in 1559, and the evacuation of the Piedmontese cities held by French and Spanish troops in 1574, restored his state. By removing the capital from Chambéry to Turin, he completed the transformation of the dukes of Savoy from Burgundian into Italian sovereigns. They still owned Savoy beyond the Alps, the plains of Bresse, and the maritime province of Nice.

Emmanuele Filiberto was succeeded by his son Carlo Emmanuele I., who married Catherine, a daughter of Philip II. He seized the first opportunity of annexing Saluzzo, which had been lost to Savoy in the last two reigns, and renewed the disastrous policy of his grandfather Charles III. by invading Geneva and threatening Provence. Henry IV. of France forced him in 1601 to relinquish Bresse and his Burgundian possessions. In return he was allowed to keep Saluzzo. All hopes of conquest on the transalpine side were now quenched; but the keys of Italy had been given to the dukes of Savoy; and their attention was still further concentrated upon Lombard conquests. Carlo Emmanuele now attempted the acquisition of Montferrat, which was soon to become vacant by the death of Francesco Gonzaga, who held it together with Mantua. In order to secure this territory, he went to war with Philip III. of Spain, and allied himself with Venice and the Grisons to expel the Spaniards from the Valtelline. When the male line of the Gonzaga family expired in 1627, Charles, duke of Nevers, claimed Mantua and Montferrat in right of his wife, the only daughter of the last duke. Carlo Emmanuele was now checkmated by France, as he had formerly been by Spain. The total gains of all his strenuous endeavours amounted to the acquisition of a few places on the borders of Montferrat.

Not only the Gonzagas, but several other ancient ducal families, died out about the date which we have reached. The legitimate line of the Estensi ended in 1597 by the death of Alfonso II., the last duke of Ferrara. He left his domains to a natural relative, Cesare d’Este, who would in earlier days have inherited without dispute, for bastardy had been no bar on more than one occasion in the Este pedigree. L τ rban VIII., however, put in a claim to Ferrara, which, it will be remembered, had been recognized a papal fief in 1530. Cesare d’Este had to content himself with Modena and Reggio, where his descendants reigned as dukes till 1794. Linder the same pontiff, the Holy See absorbed the duchy of Urbino on the death of Francesco Maria II., the last representative of Montefeltro and Della Rovere. The popes were now masters of a fine and compact territory, embracing no inconsiderable portion of Countess Matilda’s legacy, in addition to Pippin’s donation and the patrimony of St Peter. Meanwhile Spanish fanaticism, the suppression of the Huguenots in France, and the Catholic policy of Austria combined to strengthen their authority as pontiffs. Urban’s predecessor, Paul V., advanced so far as to extend his spiritual jurisdiction over Venice, which, up to the date of his election (1605), had resisted all encroachments of the Holy See. Venice offered the single instance in Italy of a national church. The republic managed the tithes, and the clergy acknowledged no chief above their own patriarch. Paul V. now forced the Venetians to admit his ecclesiastical supremacy; but they refused to readmit the Jesuits, who had been expelled in 1606. This, if we do not count the proclamation of [9:13:484] James I. of England (1604), was the earliest instance of the order’s banishment from a state where it had proved disloyal to the commonwealth.

Venice rapidly declined throughout the 17th century. The loss of trade consequent upon the closing of Egypt and the Levant, together with the discovery of America and the sea-route to the Indies, had dried up her chief source of wealth. Prolonged warfare with the Ottomans, who forced her to abandon Candia in 1669, as they had robbed her of Cyprus in 1570, still further crippled her resources. Yet she kept the Adriatic free of pirates, notably by suppressing the sea-robbers called Uscocchi (1601—1617), maintained herself in the Ionian Islands, and in 1684 added one more to the series of victorious episodes which render her annals so romantic. In that year Francesco Morosini, upon whose tomb we still may read the title Peloponnesiacus, wrested the whole of the Morea from the Turks. But after his death in 1715 the republic relaxed her hold upon his conquests. The Venetian nobles abandoned themselves to indolence and vice. Many of them fell into the slough of pauperism, and were saved from starvation by public doles. Though the signory still made a brave show upon occasions of parade, it was clear that the state was rotten to the core, and sinking into the decrepitude of dotage. The Spanish monarchy at the same epoch dwindled with apparently less reason. Philip’s Austrian successors reduced it to the rank of a secondary European power. This decline of vigour was felt, with the customary effects of discord and bad government, in Lower Italy. The revolt of Masaniello in Naples (1647), followed by rebellions at Palermo and Messina, which placed Sicily for a while in the hands of Louis XIV. (1676—1678), were symptoms of progressive anarchy. The population, ground down by preposterous taxes, ill-used as only the subjects of Spaniards, Turks, or Bourbons are handled, rose in blind exasperation against their oppressors. It is impossible to attach political importance to these revolutions; nor did they bring the people any appreciable good. The destinies of Italy'were decided in the cabinets and on the battlefields of Northern Europe. A Bourbon at Versailles, a Hapsburg at Vienna, or a thick-lipped Lorrainer, with a stroke of his pen, wrote off province against province, regarding not the populations who had bled for him or thrown themselves upon his mercy.

This inglorious and passive chapter of Italian history is continued to the date of the French Revolution with the records of three dynastic wars, the war of the Spanish succession, the war of the Polish succession, the war of the Austrian succession, followed by three European treaties, which brought them respectively to diplomatic terminations. Italy, handled .nd rehandled, settled and resettled, upon each of these occasions, changed masters without caring or knowing what befel the principals in any one of the disputes. Humiliating to human nature in general as are the annals of the 18th century campaigns in Europe, there is no point of view from which they appear in a light so tragi-comic as from that afforded by Italian history. The system of setting nations by the ears with the view of settling the quarrels of a few reigning houses was reduced to absurdity when the people, as in these cases, came to be partitioned and exchanged without the assertion or negation of a single principle affecting their interests or rousing their emotions.

In 1700 Charles II. died, and with him ended the Austrian family in Spain. Louis XIV. claimed the throne for Philip, duke of Anjou. Charles, archduke of Austria, opposed him. The dispute was fought out in Flanders; but Lombardy felt the shock, as usual, of the French and Austrian dynasties. The French armies were more than once defeated by Prince Eugene of Savoy, who drove them out of Italy in 1707. Therefore, in the peace of Utrecht (1713), the services of the house of Savoy had to be duly recognized. Vittorio Amedeo II. received Sicily with the title of king. Montferrat and Alessandria were added to his northern provinces, and his state was recognized as independent. Charles of Austria, now emperor, took Milan, Mantua, Naples, and Sardinia for his portion of the Italian spoil Philip founded the Bourbon line of Spanish kings, renouncing in Italy all that his Hapsburg predecessors had gained. Discontented with this diminution of the Spanish heritage, Philip V. married Elisabetta Farnese, heiress to the last duke of Parma, in 1714. He hoped to secure this duchy for his son, Don Carlos; and Elisabetta further brought with her a claim to the grand-duchy of Tuscany, which would soon become vacant by the death of Gian Gastone de’ Medici. After this marriage Philip broke the peace of Europe by invading Sardinia. The Quadruple Alliance was formed, and the new king of Sicily was punished for his supposed adherence to Philip V. by the forced exchange of Sicily for the island of Sardinia. It was thus that in 1720 the house of Savoy assumed the regal title which it bore until the declaration of the Italian kingdom in this century. Vittorio Amedeo H.’s reign was of great importance in the history of his state. Though a despot, as all monarchs were obliged to be at that date, he reigned with prudence, probity, and zeal for the welfare of his subjects. He took public education out of the hands of the Jesuits, which, for the future development of manliness in his dominions, was a measure of incalculable value. The duchy of Savoy in his days became a kingdom, and Sardinia, though it seemed a poor exchange for Sicily, was a far less perilous possession than the larger and wealthier island would have been. In 1730 Vittorio Amedeo abdicated in favour of his son Carlo Emmanuele III. Repenting of this step, he subsequently attempted to regain Turin, but was imprisoned in the castle of Rivoli, where he ended his days in 1732.

The war of the Polish succession which now disturbed Europe is only important in Italian history because the treaty of Vienna in 1738 settled the disputed affairs of the duchies of Parma and Tuscany. The duke Antonio Farnese died in 1731; the grand-duke Gian Gastone de’ Medici died in 1737. In the duchy of Parma Don Carlos had already been proclaimed. But he was now transferred to the Two Sicilies, while Francis of Lorraine, the husband of Maria Theresa, took Tuscany and Parma. Milan and Mantua remained in the hands of the Austrians. On this occasion Carlo Emmanuele acquired Tortona and Novara.

Worse complications ensued for the Italians when the emperor Charles VI., father of Maria Theresa, died in 1740. The three branches of the Bourbon house, ruling in France, Spain, and the Sicilies, joined with Prussia, Bavaria, and the kingdom of Sardinia to despoil Maria Theresa of her heritage. Lombardy was made the seat of war; and here the king of Sardinia acted as in some sense the arbiter of the situation. After war broke out, he changed sides and supported the Hapsburg-Lorraine party. At first, in 1745, the Sardinians were defeated by the French and Spanish troops. But Francis of Lorraine, elected emperor in that year, sent an army to the king’s support, which in 1746 obtained a signal victory over the Bourbons at Piacenza. Carlo Emmanuele now threatened Genoa. The Austrian soldiers already held the town. But the citizens expelled them, and the republic kept her independence. In 1748 the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which put an end to the war of the Austrian succession, once more redivided Italy. Parma, Piacenza, and Guastalla were formed into a duchy for Don Philip, brother of Charles III. of the Two Sicilies, and son of Philip V. of Spain. Charles III. was confirmed in his kingdom of the [9:13:485] Two Sicilies. The Austrians kept Milan and Tuscany. The duchy of Modena was placed under the protection of the French. So was Genoa, which in 1755, after Paoli’s insurrection against the misgovernment of the republic, ceded her old domain of Corsica to France.

From the date of this settlement until 1792, Italy enjoyed a period of repose and internal amelioration under her numerous paternal despots. It became the fashion during these forty-four years of peace to encourage the industrial population and to experimentalize in economical reforms. The emperor Francis I. ruled the grand-duchy of Tuscany by lieutenants until his death in 1765, when it was given, as an independent state, to his third son, Peteι∙ Leopold. The reign of this duke was long remembered as a period of internal prosperity, wise legislation, and important public enterprise. Leopold, among other useful works, drained the Val di Chiana, and restored those fertile upland plains to agriculture. In 1790 he succeeded to the empire, and left Tuscany to his son Ferdinand. The kingdom of Sardinia was administered upon similar principles,, but with less of geniality. Carlo Emmanuele made his will law, and erased the remnants of free institutions from his state. At the same time he wisely followed his father’s policy with regard to education and the church. This is perhaps the best that can be said of a king who incarnated the stolid absolutism of the period. From this date, however, we are able to trace the revival of independent thought among the Italians. The European ferment of ideas which preceded the French Revolution expressed itself in men like Alfieri, the fierce denouncer of tyrants, Beccaria, the philosopher of criminal jurisprudence, Volta, the physicist, and numerous political economists of Tuscany. Moved partly by external influences and partly by a slow internal reawakening, the people was preparing for the efforts of the present century. The papacy, during this period, had to reconsider the question of the Jesuits, who made themselves universally odious, not only in Italy, but also in France and Spain. In the pontificate of Clement XIII. they ruled the Vatican, and almost succeeded in embroiling the pope with the concerted Bourbon potentates of Europe. His successor, Clement XIV., suppressed the order altogether by a brief of 1773. For the divisions of Italy at this time see Plate VI.

Achievement of Independence.

The malarious tranquillity of Italy beneath her Austrian and Bourbon despots was rudely shaken by the French Revolution. This is not the place to describe Napoleon’s campaign of 1796. But the treaty of Campo Formio, which resettled Italy in 1797, has to be described. Northern and Central Italy was redivided into four republics, —the Cisalpine, with its capital in Milan; the Ligurian, with Genoa for capital; the Cispadane, with Bologna; the Tiberine, with Rome. Venice (where the last doge, Luigi Manini, had dissolved the republic of St Mark amid the execrations of the populace in the month of May) was flung, together with her territory between the Adige and the Adriatic, as a compensation for other losses, to the Austrian empire. In the next year, 1798, Lower Italy became the Parthenopaean republic, with Naples for its capital. . Carlo Emmanuele III., now king of Sardinia, resigned his dominions. Pius VI. fled from Rome, and died in France in 1/99. The whole of the old order of the peninsula was thus destroyed at a blow. Yet the people, at first, gained little but an exchange of masters, increased taxes, and a participation in the doubtful glories of the French republic. While Bonaparte was absent in Egypt, his recent settlement of Italian affairs was upset, and the French were everywhere driven out of the peninsula by force of arms. He returned, and Marengo (1800) made him once more master of Italy. Four years later, having proclaimed himself emperor, he took the Lombard crown in St Ambrogio at Milan. Italy now ranked as his kingdom, and a new settlement of her provinces had to be effected. The pope was left in Rome, and Ferdinand in Naples. Tuscany was rechristened the kingdom of Etruria, and given to the Bourbons. The Ligurian and Cisalpine republics were placed under the viceroy Eugene Beauharnais. After Austerlitz, Venice was added to this North Italian kingdom; and in 1806 Bonaparte made the Bourbons yield Naples to his brother Joseph. When Joseph went in 1808 to Madrid, Joachim Murat succeeded him as king in Naples. Sicily remained in the hands of Ferdinand. In 1809 Pius VII. was deposed, and sent to France, and Rome was declared a part of the French empire. The gingerbread kingdom of Etruria was abolished, and Bonaparte’s sister, Eliza, wife of a Colonel Bacciocchi, was made duchess of Tuscany, with the titles of duchess of Lucca and princess of Piombino. Ephemeral as were Bonaparte’s successive divisions and redivisions of Italy into provinces for his generals and relatives, they exercised no little influence. From the period of the French rule we may date a new sense of nationality among Italians, generated by the military service of recruits drawn together from all districts in Napoleon’s armies, by the temporary obliteration of most ancient boundaries, by the dethronement of alien and unloved princes, by the equal administration of one code of laws, and by the spirit of the revolution which animated all French institutions. Italy began to feel herself a nation, and though it was long before Europe suffered her to win national rights, the demand for them, which in our own days became too imperious to be resisted, was created in her people at this epoch.

The congress of Vienna in 1815 took down from the theatre of Italy all Bonaparte’s decorations, and set up the old scenery in very nearly the old places. Vittorio Emmanuele I. received back his kingdom of Sardinia, with the addition of Genoa. Venice and Milan were formed into the province of Lombardo-Venezia for Francis II., emperor of Austria. The old duchy of Parma was given for her lifetime to Maria Louisa, who, though the wife of Bonaparte, was still an Austrian princess. Upon her death it was to be restored to its former Bourbon princes, who received in the meanwhile Lucca as an equivalent. The Austrian Ferdinand III. was once again grand-duke of Tuscany, with the reversion of Lucca after Maria Louisa’s decease. Francis, son of the Austrian archduke Ferdinand and Beatrice d’Este, became duke of Modena, with the reversion of Lunigiana on the same event. Pius VII. got back all the states of the church, and on his re-entry into Rome restored the Jesuits, who had prove their indispensability to tyrants. The Bourbon Ferdinand I. again joined Naples to his crown of Sicily. We have been careful to label these Ferdinands and Francises with their respective names of Austrian or Bourbon, in order that the partition of Italy between the two dynasties, and the large preponderance of Austrian over Bourbon influence, might be apparent. One significant detail has been omitted. The congress of Vienna recognized the independent republic of San Marino. On the top of a little mountain at the outskirts of the Apennines which overlook the sea by Rimini, sat Liberty, the queen of a few hundred citizens, surveying the muddy ocean of Franco-Spanish, Italo-Teutonic despotism which drowned Italy through all her length and breadth.

The Italian sovereigns, on returning to their respective states, proved that exile and the revolution had terrorized them into more determined tyranny. The civil and political reforms which had been instituted at the end of the last century were abandoned. The Jesuits were restored[9:13:486]; many suppressed monasteries were re-established; and the mortmain laws were repealed. Elementary education was narrowed in its limits, and thrown into the hands of the clergy. Professors suspected of liberal views were expelled from the universities, and the press was placed under the most rigid supervision. All persons who had taken part in the Napoleonic governments, or who were known to entertain patriotic opinions, found themselves harassed, watched, spied upon, and reported. The cities swarmed with police agents and informers. The passport system was made more stringent, and men were frequently refused even a few days’ leave of absence from their homes. The Code Napoléon was withdrawn from those provinces which had formed part of the Italian kingdom, while, in the papal states, the administration was placed again in the hands of ecclesiastics.

This political and spiritual reign of terror, which had for its object the crushing of Italian liberalism, was sanctioned and supported by Austria. Each petty potentate bound himself to receive orders from Vienna, and, in return for this obedience, the emperor guaranteed him in the possession of his throne. The Lombardo-Venetian kingdom, powerfully defended and connected with Austria by land and sea, became one huge fortress, garrisoned with armed men, in perpetual menace of the country. Under these conditions the Italians were half maddened, and thousands of otherwise quiet citizens, either in the hope of finding redress and protection, or only from a feeling of revenge, joined secret revolutionary societies; for it must not be supposed that the revolution had left the Italians as passive as it found them. A new spirit was astir, which was not likely to be checked by the arrangements of the European congress—the spirit of national independence. During the convulsions caused by Napoleon’s conquest of Italy, the allied powers had themselves fostered this spirit, in order to oppose French rule. The Austrians, the English, and Murat, in turn, had publicly invited the Italians to fight for their national independence. And now the people, who relied upon these proclamations and expected the fidfilment of so many promises, found themselves by the consent of Europe delivered over, tied and gagged, to a foreign oppressor. To take but one example: Ferdinand, when he quitted Naples in May 1815, addressed a proclamation to his subjects, solemnly engaging to respect the laws that should in his absence be decreed by a constitution. In June he pledged himself at Vienna to introduce into his kingdom no institutions irreconcilable witlr those which Austria might establish in her own dependencies. Accordingly in 1816 he put an end to the Sicilian constitution of 1812.

Tyranny was met by conspiracy; and in a short while, the Carbonari societies, with Sanfedisti and many other revolutionary associations, had extended their organization through the length and breadth of the peninsula. The discontent of the Italians smouldered for five years; but in 1820 it broke into open flame. On the 1st of January in that year the Spaniards proclaimed their constitution of the Cortes, which was modelled on the type furnished by the earlier French Revolution. Moved by this example, the royal army mutinied at Naples in July, and a few days afterwards Palermo rushed to arms. Ferdinand was so surprised by the sudden outbreak of this revolt that he hastily granted the constitution, named his son Francis vicar-general of his kingdom, and betook himself to Austria. The Austrians marched 80,000 men into Lombardy, and Great Britain and France sent their fleets down to the Bay of Naples. At a congress held in the spring of 1821 at Laybach, the allied powers authorized Austria to crush the revolution in Lower Italy. Austrian troops entered Naples on the 23d of March; and, when Ferdinand followed them, he had nothing to do but to execute vengeance, by mock trials, on his insurgent subjects.

While these events were taking place, another military insurrection broke out in Piedmont, where the Spanish constitution was proclaimed. The king felt himself bound by the congress of Laybach, and refused to make any concessions. Therefore, on the 13th of March, he abdicated; and in the absence of his brother and heir, Carlo Felice, his distant cousin, Carlo Alberto, prince of Carignano, was appointed regent. Carlo Alberto represented a branch of the reigning house which had been separated nearly two centuries from the throne. Educated, during the French occupation, more like a private citizen than like a prince, he grew up with liberal inclinations, and there is no doubt that his concessions to the insurrectionists in Piedmont at this moment were actuated by sympathy rather than by any vulgar desire to gain power. When, however, Carlo Felice returned and declared that his brother’s abdication had been forced and therefore illegal, Carlo Alberto’s sense of loyalty to the dynasty overcame his liberal instincts. He submitted to the new king’s authority, and the old regime was re-established in Piedmont on as absolute a basis as before.

These movements were followed by state trials and executions, and the terrorism of the tyrannies augmented. Silvio Pellico, at the close of an inefficient disturbance at Milan, was sent to life-imprisonment at Spielberg. In the papal states Leo XII. adopted a coercive policy still more grinding and humiliating. For nine years the despots and the conspirators confronted each other, until the July revolution of Paris in 1830 gave new hope and energy to the latter. On this occasion the conflagration burst out at Modena, where the duke Francesco IV. had been for some time past in secret negotiation with the patriotic party headed by Ciro Menotti. It appears that the secret object of this autocrat was to employ the revolution against his neighbours, and to make himself sovereign of Upper Italy by the help of the conspirators. But when the revolution declared itself, and spread to Parma, Bologna, and the Romagna, Francesco turned upon his friend Menotti, and succeeded in putting him to death. It took but little time or trouble to check this revolt, which was unsupported by armed force. Austrian troops moved into Emilia and Romagna, restored the old order, and marched on to Rome, which they occupied. Louis Philippe, now king of the French, being jealous of the Austrians at Rome, occupied Ancona for the French in 1832; but the cause of Italian liberty received no support from the bourgeois king, who strove to keep on good terms with established authorities.

From 1831 until 1846 Italy remained discontentedly and uneasily tranquil. The infamous misgovernment of Rome and Naples continued; and in Lower Italy numerous petty insurrections, caused by the misery of the people, and the cholera which raged in 1837, were easily suppressed. Yet it was clear to all competent observers that this state of things could not last. The Italian sovereigns were seated over a volcano, which vibrated to the least stir in its neighbour, France, and which was slowly accumulating explosive material. Among the most powerful instruments now invented by the party of independence must be reckoned the scientific congress. This body, ostensibly formed for the study of science, assembled every year in some Italian city. Its meetings really served to propagate liberal opinions and to establish relations between the patriots of different districts. Meanwhile the great men who were destined to achieve the future union of Italy had appeared upon the stage, and were busy through this period with their pen and voice. Giuseppe Mazzini, born in 1808 at Genoa, made himself the recognized head of a party called by the name of Young Italy. It was his aim [9:13:487] to organize the forces of the revolution, and to establish the one and indivisible republic in Europa Though he strove in the cause of Italy, his scheme for the regeneration of society far exceeded the limits of that country. He declared war upon established order in its ancient forms all over the world, and was willing to use conspiracy, if not assassination, in order to achieve his ends. Thus, though the spirit infused into the Italians by Mazzini’s splendid eloquence aroused the people to a sense of their high destinies and duties, though he was the first to believe firmly that Italy could and would be one free nation, yet the means he sanctioned for securing this result, and the policy which was inseparable from his opinions, proved obstacles to statesmen of more practical and sober views. It was the misfortune of Italy at this epoch that she had not only to fight for independence, but also to decide upon the form of government which the nation should elect when it was constituted. All right-thinking and patriotic men agreed in their desire to free the country from foreign rule, and to establish national self-government. But should they aim at a republic or a constitutional monarchy·? Should they be satisfied with the hegemony of Piedmont? Should they attempt a confederation, and if so, how should the papacy take rank, and should the petty sovereigns be regarded as sufficiently Italian to hold their thrones? These and many other hypothetical problems distracted the Italian patriots. It was impossible for them, in the circumstances, first to form the nation and then to decide upon its government; for the methods to be employed in fighting for independence already implied some political principle. Mazzini’s manipulation of conspiracy, for instance, was revolutionary and republican; while those who adhered to constitutional order, and relied upon the arms of Piedmont, had virtually voted for Sardinian hegemony. The unanimous desire for independence existed in a vague and nebulous condition. It needed to be condensed into workable hypotheses; but this process could not be carried on without the growth of sects perilous to common action.

The party of Young Italy, championed by Mazzini, was the first to detach itself, and to control the blindly working forces of the Carbonari movement by a settled plan of action. It was the programme of Young Italy to establish a republic by the aid of volunteers recruited from all parts of the peninsula. When Carlo Alberto came to the throne, Mazzini addressed him a letter, as equal unto equal, calling upon the king to defy Austria and rely upon God and the people. Because Carlo Alberto (who, in spite of his fervent patriotism and genuine liberality of soul, was a man of mixed opinions, scrupulous in his sense of constitutional obligation, melancholy by temperament, and superstitiously religious), found himself unwilling or unable to take this step, the Mazzinisti denounced him as a traitor to 1821 and a retrogressive autocrat. In his exile at Geneva, Mazzini now organized an armed attempt on Savoy. He collected a few hundred refugees of all nations, and crossed the frontier in 1833. But this feeble attack produced no result beyond convincing Carlo Alberto that he could not trust the republicans. Subsequent attempts on the king’s life roused a new sense of loyalty in Piedmont, and defined a counter-body of opinion to Mazzini’s. The patriots of a more practical type, who may be called moderate liberals, began, in one form or another, to aim at achieving the independence of Italy constitutionally by the help of the Sardinian kingdom. What rank Sardinia would take in the new Italy remained an open question. The publication of Vincenzo Gioberti’s treatise, Il Primato morale e civile degli Italiani, in 1843, considerably aided the growth of definite opinion. His utopia was a confederation of Italian powers, under the spiritual presidency of the papacy, and with the army of Piedmont for sword and shield. This book had an immense success. It made timid thinkers feel that they could join the liberals without sacrificing their religious or constitutional opinions. At the same date Cesare Balbo’s Sp)eranze eV Italia exercised a somewhat similar influence, through its sound and unsubversive principles. In its pages Balbo made one shrewd guess, that the Eastern Question would decide Italian independence. Massimo d’Azeglio, who also was a Piedmontese; the poet Giusti, the Baron Ricasoli, and the Marchese Gino Capponi in Tuscany; together with Alessandro Manzoni at Milan, and many other writers scattered through the provinces of Italy, gave their weight to the formation of this moderate liberal party. These men united in condemning the extreme democracy of the Mazzinisti, and did not believe that Italy could be regenerated by merely manipulating the insurrectionary force of the revolution. On political and religious questions they were much divided in detail, suffering in this respect from the weakness inherent in liberalism. Yet we are already justified in regarding this party as a sufficient counterpoise to the republicans; and the man who was destined to give it coherence, and to win the great prize of Italian independence by consolidating and working out its principles in practice, was already there. The count Camillo Benso di Cavour had been born in 1810, two years later than Mazzini. He had not yet entered upon his ministerial career, but was writing articles for the Risorgimento, which at Turin opposed the Mazzinistic journal Concordia, and was devoting himself to political and economical studies. It is impossible to speak of Mazzini and Cavour without remembering the third great regenerator of Italy, Giuseppe Garibaldi. At this date he was in exile; but a few years later he returned, and began his career of popular deliverance in Lombardy. Mazzini, the prophet, Garibaldi, the knight-errant, and Cavour, the statesman, of Italian independence, were all natives of the kingdom of Sardinia. But their several positions in it were so different as to account in no small measure for the very divergent parts they played in the coming drama. Mazzini was a native of Genoa, which ill tolerated the enforced rule of Turin. Garibaldi came from Nice, and was a child of the people. Cavour was born in the midst of that stiff aristocratical society of old Piedmont which has been described so vividly by D’Azeglio in his Ricordi. The Piedmontese nobles had the virtues and the defects of English country squires in the last century. Loyal, truthful, brave, hard-headed, tough in resistance, obstinately prejudiced, they made excellent soldiers, and were devoted servants of the crown. Moreover, they hid beneath their stolid exterior greater political capacity than the more genial and brilliant inhabitants of Southern and Central Italy. Cavour came of this race, and understood it. But he was a man of exceptional quality. He had the genius of statesmanship,—a practical sense of what could be done, combined with rare dexterity in doing it, fine diplomatic and parliamentary tact, and noble courage in the hour of need. Without the enthusiasm, amounting to the passion of a new religion, which Mazzini inspired, without Garibaldi’s brilliant achievements, and the idolatry excited by this pure-hearted hero in the breasts of all who fought with him and felt his sacred fire, there is little doubt that Cavour would not have found the creation of United Italy possible. But if Cavour had not been there to win the confidence, support, and sympathy of Europe, if he had not been recognized by the body of the nation as a man whose work was solid and whose sense was just in all emergencies, Mazzini’s efforts would have run to waste in questionable insurrections, and Garibaldi’s feats of arms must have added but one chapter more to the history of unproductive patriotism. While, therefore, we [9:13:488] recognize the part played by each of these great men in the liberation of their country, and while we willingly ignore their differences and disputes, it is Cavourwhom we must honour with the title of the Maker of United Italy.

From this digression, which was necessary in order to make the next acts in the drama clear, we now return to the year 1846. Misrule had reached its climax in Rome, and the people were well-nigh maddened, when Gregory XVI. died, and Pius IX. was elected in his stead. It seemed as though an age of gold had dawned; for the greatest of all miracles had happened. The new pope declared himself a liberal, proclaimed a general amnesty to political offenders, and in due course granted a national guard, and began to form a constitution. The Neo-Guelfic school of Gioberti believed that their master’s utopia was about to be realized. Italy went wild with joy and demonstrations. The pope’s example proved contagious. Constitutions were granted in Tuscany, Piedmont, and Rome in 1847. The duke of Lucca fled, and his domain was joined to Tuscany. Only Austria and Naples declared that their states needed no reforms. On the 2d of January 1848 a liberal demonstration at Milan served the Austrians for pretext to massacre defenceless persons in the streets. These Milanese victims were hailed as martyrs all over Italy, and funeral ceremonies, partaking of the same patriotic character as the rejoicings of the previous year, kept up the popular agitation. On the 12th of January Palermo rose against King Ferdinand II., and Naples followed her example on the 27th. The king was forced in February to grant the constitution of 1812, to which his subjects were so ardently attached.

While Italy was thus engaged in making terms with her own sovereigns, the French revolution broke out. Louis Philippe fled to England, and the republic was declared. This altered affairs in Italy, and threw a temporary power into the hands of the Mazzinisti. Sicily pronounced herself independent of the Bourbons, and called the duke of Genoa to the throne. In Naples, the moderate liberal government, of which Poerio had been a member, yielded to a more radical administration. The patriots and the king’s troops came to blows, ending in Ferdinand’s victory and the remodelling of the constitution. Lombardy rose in insurrection. The Austrians were expelled from Milan, and the governor of Venice capitulated. Provisional republican governments were formed, at Milan under the presidency of Casati, at Venice under that of Daniele Manin. Impelled by the overwhelming enthusiasm which prevailed in Upper Italy, Carlo Alberto declared war on Austria in March. On the 8th of April he pushed his troops beyond the Mincio; while Piacenza, Parma, Modena, and the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom voted their union to Sardinia by universal suffrage. But the Austrian general, Radetzky, though he lost a battle at Goito, and was forced to witness the capitulation of Peschiera in May, Lad not given up the game. The pope’s troops were established at Vicenza to support the Sardinians. These Radetzky compelled to surrender in June; he then attacked Carlo Alberto’s army, who were engaged in the investment of Mantua. A complete victory upon the 25th of July at Custozza enabled Radetzky to re-enter Milan. Carlo Alberto had to retire beyond the Ticino and to beg for an armistice. News of this Austrian victory reached Naples, and gave Ferdinand the heart to quell the Sicilian revolt. On the 30th August Messina was bombarded, and such atrocities were perpetrated in the miserable city that the admirals of the French and English fleetshad to interfere and extort an armistice from the conquerors. In the meanwhile, affairs had begun to change in Rome. The pope, frightened at the revolution which had already outrun his control, pronounced against the Austrian war and Italian alliance. This roused republican hostility. His minister, the excellent Count Pellegrini Rossi, was murdered in November, and anarchy seemed to threaten the city. Pius escaped in disguise to Gaeta, where he was received by Ferdinand, whom not long since he had denounced as a rogue. From Gaeta he opened the new year, 1849, with a threat of excommunication to his subjects. The Romans were so irritated that the moderate liberal party had to yield to the ultra-radicals; and on the 9th of February Rome was declared a republic. The government was entrusted to three dictators, of whom Mazzini was the head. Tuscany, meanwhile, had lost her grand-duke. After opening parliament in January with a declaration that he intended to prosecute the war against Austria, he escaped in February on the English war-steamer “Bulldog” to Gaeta. A provisional government was established in Florence, and Mazzini did his best to render Tuscany a part of the new Roman republic. At this epoch two important personages appeared upon the scene—Gino Capponi, who led the moderate liberals, and Urbano Rattazzi, who headed the democratic party. The Florentines were not at bottom out of sympathy with their duke. Therefore they rejected Mazzini’s overtures, and recalled Leopold upon the understanding that he would respect their free institutions. Still at Gaeta, the grand-duke mistrusted these advances, begged for Austrian troops, and, when they had arrived, reentered Tuscany and suppressed the constitution. Such acts of perfidy as these, repeatedly committed by all the petty sovereigns of Italy with the exception of the house of Savoy, forced the people to abandon the theory of federation under existing governments, and to look for their salvation to Piedmont.

This growing confidence in the Sardinian monarchy was not shaken by the disastrous campaign of March 1849, which baptized the cause of Italian independence with the best blood of Piedmont, gave it a royal martyr, and pledged the dynasty of Savoy to a progressive policy from which it never afterwards for a single moment deviated. Pushed by the ultra-radicals, and burning with the purest zeal to liberate Italy, Carlo Alberto took the field again in March 1849 against the Austrians. On the 24th, after some preliminary movements, proving a want of good generalship and discipline in the Piedmontese army, Radetzky obtained a complete victory at Novara. The king of Sardinia abdicated on the field, in favour of his son, the duke of Savoy, Vittorio Emmanuele II. Carlo Alberto, who had lived through times so troublous and perplexing, who had exposed himself to misunderstanding and misinterpretation, but in whom the devotion to Italy had become a religion, now took refuge at Oporto, where he died, broken-hearted, after a few months of illness. The pathos of this death checked the snarling of discordant parties; and, when the king’s body was brought home to be buried on the heights of the Superga, the heart of Italy recognized his worth. Carlo Alberto, though still anathematized by the republican faction, became the saint of Italy. Hundreds of pilgrims flocked to his tomb. The loyalty of his subjects redoubled · and it was felt that, by serving Italy, they would glorify his memory. More than ever, by the disasters of Novara, were the dynasty and aristocracy and people of Sardinia pledged to that national policy which Carlo Alberto’s son triumphantly accomplished. In the cottage homes of Piedmont and Lombardy travellers may still behold the old king’s agony depicted side by side with the portraits of Cavour and Garibaldi and Vittorio Emmanuele.

The intrigues of which Gaeta had been a centre provoked a crusade of the Catholic powers against republican and anti-papal Rome. A French expedition, under General Oudinot, landed at Civita Vecchia on the 25th of April, and on the 29th reached the walls of the city. The Neapolitan [9:13:489] army took up a position at the base of the Alban hills. Spaniards arrived at Fiumicino, and Austrians entered the Legations. The French professed to come as friends · but the triumvirs of the Roman republic refused them entrance, and General Oudinot established his camp on the Janiculan. Garibaldi, who was guarding the frontier of the Abruzzi,returned and defeated the Neapolitans at Palestrina on the 11th of May. Still his assistance did not suffice to avert the French attack, and on July 2, after a siege of four weeks, the city capitulated. Mazzini and Garibaldi made good their escape. The French troops entered and held Rome for the pope. It was not until April 1850, however, that Pius IX. ventured to return. When he arrived in his capital, he began the reactionary reign, supported by his French garrison and Jesuit advisers, which only ended with the semi-forcible entry of the Italians in 1870.

With the fall of Rome the hopes of the revolutionary party ended. Austrian troops replaced their ducal puppets in Parma, Modena, and Tuscany. King Ferdinand, rightly now named Bomba, terrorized his subjects into silence ⅜>y the aid of Swiss mercenaries, artillery, and dungeons too loathsome to be described. Only Venice still held out, blockaded in the Adriatic and bombarded from the land, through all the horrors of famine, conflagration, and cholera, until the month of August. Few episodes in the history of that noble city are more glorious than this last desperate and patient struggle; and few names upon her muster-roll of heroes are equally illustrious with that of the lion-hearted and blameless Daniele Manin.

In the disastrous year 1849 it seemed as though tlιe f fate of Italy was sealed. The republicans had done their l best and failed at Milan, Rome, and Venice. The power of Piedmont was broken at Novara. And yet we have good cause to say that the miseries of this epoch wrought the future salvation of the race. The former vain trust in the Italian sentiment of petty courts, the Neo-Guelfic mysticism of Gioberti’s party, the utopian confidence in papal liberalism, the vague schemes of confederation which had assumed many visionary forms, were all dissipated for ever. To rightly thinking men it became clear that the regeneration of Italy must be entrusted to Piedmont. When Vittorio Emmanuele entered Turin in silence after Novara, with a demoralized army and a ruined exchequer, the spirit of his people was cast down, but not extinguished. They had assumed responsibility, and were not going to abandon it. “The house of Savoy cannot retreat” became the watchword of the throne. D’Azeglio’s Hous recommencerons expressed the determination of the ruling > classes. It is true that at this crisis they had to combat the hostility and bitter jealousy of the republicans. Mazzini’s party stirred up Genoa to revolution, and La Marmora received the ignoble task of restoring that intractable city to a sense of duty. “Better Italy enslaved than delivered over to the son of the traitor Carlo Alberto,” exclaimed the prophet of democracy, whom no reverses could persuade that in such politics as those of Italy the half is better than the whole. But Mazzini was no longer a power of the first magnitude. The work which he had done for Italy was solid and abiding. Still he had failed to carry the bulk of the nation with him. Men of more sober aspirations saw that to aim at national independence and European reconstruction at one leap was utopian. Italy must first be made; and the only power capable of calling her into existence was Piedmont, still free and puissant among a crowd of feeble and anarchical despotisms. The experience of ’49 proved that the armies of Piedmont, in the hour of need, could rely on volunteers of pith and nerve, in cities so downtrodden even as were Rome and Venice; for it must not be forgotten that the republicans who sustained both sieges were members of the bourgeoisie and proletariate. This consolidation of opinion after the events of 1849 was proved by Gioberti’s recantation of his earlier mysticism. In 1851 he published a new treatise the Pinnovamento, which distinctly indicated Piedmont as the substantial basis of Italian independence. Daniele Manin, now an exile in Paris, declared his adhesion to the same doctrine. The constitutional party was further strengthened by the adhesion of the leading republicans, Pallavicino and La Farina; and in 1857 the main point of unaminity was secured by the formation of the Società Nazion ale, which kept sectarian jealousies in the background. Garibaldi, at this time less republican than he afterwards became, was himself a president of this political association. Henceforward the genuine Mazzinisti formed a permanent minority. They could do little more than to impede without perplexing or baffling the policy of the Piedmontese statesmen, who felt themselves to be supported by the instincts of the race at large.

Vittorio Emmanuele began his reign with Massimo d’Azeglio for minister. He steadily refused all Austrian advances, though enforced by his own wife and mother, both of whom were Austrian archduchesses, The house of Savoy had pledged itself to Italy, and the house had never broken faith. The first cares of the new ministry were devoted to internal reforms, to the organization of the army by La Marmora, and to financial measures. In 1850 they passed the so-called Siccardi law, which abolished ecclesiastical courts. This was followed by a law of civil marriage; and in 1854 the ecclesiastical reforms were completed by Rattazzi’s bill for restricting religious corporations and placing church property under state control. The necessity of these measures is demonstrated by the fact that the little kingdom of Sardinia counted 41 bishops, 1417 canonries, about 18,000 persons vowed to a monastic life, and one ecclesiastic to every 214 inhabitants. Their importance will be understood when we reflect that these laws were extended to Italy after the union.

Meanwhile Cavour had joined the government in 1850, as minister of commerce. Not least among his great qualities was a thorough understanding of parliamentary tactics; and, though his first attempts at public speaking were unsuccessful, he soon remedied this defect. Mastery of facts and moral force gave weight to his eloquence far above rhetoric. Meanwhile his study of English politics, and admiration for men like Pitt and Peel, developed what in him was an innate instinct for parliamentary leadership. This sound sense of the conditions of representative government induced him to form a coalition with Rattazzi, the leader of the democrats, in 1852. D’Azeglio and the king were frightened by so bold a step. But Cavour’s preponderance in the chambers was irresistible; and in November 1853 he superseded D’Azeglio as prime minister. From this date the fortunes of Italy were in his hands, and Cavour became one of the foremost men in Europe. It was by his advice that the Sardinian troops under General La Marmora took part with France and England in the Crimean war, where they distinguished themselves in the battle of the Tchernaya. The nation by this step secured powerful allies, forced itself upon the notice of Europe, and accustomed its army to service on a grand scale. At the congress of Paris in 1856 Cavour represented Sardinia, and laid the grievances of Italy before the allied powers. Both France and England remonstrated, but vainly, with Ferdinand II. for his misgovernment.

Cavour had travelled both in England and France, and had observed that, though the English sympathized with Italy and were horrified by what they heard of Neapolitan atrocities, he was not likely to get more than moral support and non-interference from Great Britain. Yet he could [9:13:490] not work Italian independence without the help of one of the great powers against Austria. He therefore determined to rely on Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, who had expressed his willingness to afford substantial assistance at the proper moment. Between the years 1856 and 1859 it was Cavour’s one endeavour to maintain the French emperor in this resolve, and at the same time to drive the Austrians into a seasonable declaration of war.

The situation was delicate and dangerous in the extreme; and in January 1858 the minister’s combinations were seriously imperilled by Felice Orsini’s attempt on Napoleon’s life. It was only by passing a bill which defined the crime of political assassination that he regained the emperor’s confidence. Later in the year, Cavour met Napoleon at Plombières, where the preliminaries to a Franco-Italian alliance for war against Austria were settled.

The cabinet of Vienna, harassed by repeated memorials on the subject of their tyranny in Lombardy, complained to Europe that Piedmont was a standing menace to Italian peace, withdrew its minister from Turin, and demanded the disarmament of the Sardinian kingdom. Louis Napoleon now prepared himself for war. On the 1st of January 1859 Vittorio Emmanuele opened parliament with a speech which declared the coming struggle: “We are not insensible to the cry of suffering that rises to us from so many parts of Italy.” The words Grido di dolore were understood to be the watchword of the war. In the early summer of 1859 the French crossed the Alps. The puppets of Parma, Tuscany, and Modena fled, as usual, before the gathering storm,—this time never to return. The battles of Magenta (June 4) and Solferino (June24) opened Lombardy to the French and Sardinian troops, as far as the Quadrilateral of fortresses protecting Venice. There Louis Napoleon sheathed his sword. He met the emperor Francis Joseph at Villa Franca, and, without consulting his allies, agreed to an armistice. At Plombières he had declared that he meant to free Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic. But now he agreed upon the Mincio as the future boundary between Sardinia and Austria. Venice was not to be liberated. Terrible was the disappointment of the Piedmontese, who had made vast sacrifices for this campaign, and who felt that their king had been insulted. Yet Louis Napoleon was incapable of more. He knew himself to be no general, and he had good reason to be certain that, if he pushed Austria too far, Prussia would take up arms and carry war to France upon the Rhine. Moreover, the gain to Italy proved greater than at first appeared. Tuscany, Modena, Parma, and Romagna declared their determination to join the kingdom. In March 1860 the annexation of Central Italy to Sardinia was effected, and approved by the French emperor. It now appeared that, according to a hitherto secret understanding with Cavour, Louis Napoleon was to take Savoy and Nice as the price of his assistance. This sacrifice of their ancient home, the cradle of their dynasty, the house of Savoy made to the Italian cause. But it was long before the Italians forgave Cavour. He had to bear reproaches from all quarters, especially from Garibaldi, who was never tired of repeating, “That man has made me a foreigner in my own house.”

The same month which witnessed the annexation of Central Italy saw the outburst of a revolution in the south. Bomba was dead; but his son Francis II., by continued acts of cruelty to state prisoners, and by cowardly oppression of his subjects, had merited the nickname of Bombino. Refugees from Naples spread the tale of Bourbon tyranny all over Europe. Even London trembled with rage at Poerio’s sufferings. The insurrection broke out at Palermo, Messina, and Catania. Garibaldi determined to support it. On the 5th of May he set out from Genoa with his volunteers, the famous Mille, each of whom became for Italy a hero. Cavour knew of the expedition and secretly favoured it, though he openly expressed the regret of the Sardinian Government to Europe. It was his policy to wait and see what happened, trusting that the gain of the venture would accrue to the new kingdom. Garibaldi landed at Marsala, and proclaimed himself dictator in the name of Vittorio Emmanuele, king of Italy. The conquest of Sicily was the matter of a few days. In August the general crossed to Spart ivento, defeated the royal army, drove Francis II. to Gaeta, and entered Naples on the 7th of September. There Mazzini joined him, and the difficulties of the situation began to disclose themselves. Garibaldi had no capacity for administration; yet he was unwilling to resign his dictatorship. He had proclaimed Vittorio Emmanuele; yet he lent an ear to the republicans, who hated Piedmont. Moreover, he hardly concealed his intention of marching on Rome. Had he taken this step, success would have involved reactionary interference on the part of Europe, while failure might have involved the loss of Lower Italy. Meanwhile the natives of the Two Sicilies were slow to accept annexation. They dispensed with the Bourbons gladly; but they were ready to fulfil the prophecy of Bomba, that “whosoever turned the Bourbons out would have enough to do in Lower Italy for the next century.” Anarchy began to reign, and the Bourbon party lifted up its head again at Gaeta. In these circumstances, Cavour, after ascertaining that he had the sanction of Napoleon, resolved on sending troops into the papal states. This seemed the only means of preventing Garibaldi’s march on Rome, and securing his acquisitions for United Italy. General Cialdini accordingly occupied Urbino and Perugia, defeated the pope’s general, Lamoricière, at Castelfidardo, joined Garibaldi, and helped him to gain a victory over the Bourbon troops on the Volturno. On the 2d of October Cavour defined the situation for the parliament at Turin: “Garibaldi wishes to perpetuate the revolution; we wish to terminate it.” Soon after this, Vittorio Emmanuele himself entered the Abruzzi. Garibaldi, with the loyalty which never deserted him, resigned his dictatorship, and returned to Caprera. In November Cavour was able to write to Berlin: “We are Italy; we work in her name; but at the same time it is our policy to moderate the national movement and maintain the monarchical principle.”

In February 1861 Gaeta fell, after a resistance ennobled by the courage of Francesco’s German consort. The kingdom was annexed by plebiscite, and Vittorio Emmanuele was proclaimed king of Italy at Turin. Europe tacitly assented to Italian independence. Only Rome and Venice now remained to be liberated. The difficulties under which new Italy laboured were enormously increased by the annexation of the Two Sicilies. Ever since the Norman Conquest they had formed a province apart. Temperament, custom, and tradition separated the inhabitants, as far as it was possible, from the sober people of the north. The national parliament had to contend with brigandage encouraged by the clergy, with deeply-rooted antipathies of race, with the discontent of disbanded officials, and with the multitudinous obstacles which a demoralized society offers to strict government. Upper Italy alone was educated for political existence. Elsewhere the bad government of centuries had made the people permanently hostile to the state, while corruption rendered them untrustworthy as agents. Therefore the business of the country had to be conducted by the Piedmontese. Yet this important fact was neglected in the composition of the parliament, where a due preponderance had not been secured for the colleges of Northern Italy. It was impossible not to own that the work of’ emancipation and annexation had progressed too quickly. To add [9:13:491] to the difficulty, Italy lost her greatest statesman at this juncture. On the 5th of June 1861, Cavour died with the words “A free church in a free state” upon his lips. The last months of his life had been given to planning the peaceable acquisition of Rome by treaty with the pope and Louis Napoleon.

What remains of Italian history between 1861 and 1870 may be briefly told. Ricasoli formed a conservative Government after Cavour’s death, and Rattazzi led the opposition. Garibaldi, who vowed never to rest till Rome and Venice had been liberated, headed the party of action. In 1862 he raised a volunteer army and invaded Sicily. Louis Napoleon regarded this as a menace to Rome, and ordered Rattazzi, who was now in power, to check his progress. Cialdini marched to Reggio, where the royal troops were defeated by the volunteers on the 28th of September 1862. Next day Garibaldi was attacked and beaten at Aspromonte by General Pallavicini. He retired, wounded, to Caprera, whence he published his defence. The blame was seen to lie with Rattazzi, who had thought to follow Cavour’s policy of masterly inaction without first settling with France. The sympathy of Europe with Italy was so great after this disaster that in September 1864 Louis Napoleon agreed to a gradual withdrawal of French troops from Rome, provided Italy respected what remained of the pope’s temporal power. By the same convention Florence became the capital. This was a good step in advance towards the annexation of Rome. In 1866 the Austro-Prussian war gave a new opportunity to the Italians. They entered into alliance with Prussia, and marched an army across the Mincio. The defeats of Custozza, Monte Suello, and Lissa deprived the Italian troops of any claim to military or naval glory in this war. But the Prussian victory of Königgratz secured the main objects for which they fought. Venice, with the Quadrilateral, was joined to the Italian kingdom, while Austria kept her Istrian and Dalmatian provinces.

In accordance with the September convention, Louis Napoleon withdrew his garrison from Rome in 1866. This event inflamed the party of action. Mazzini called upon the people to seize the Eternal City; and Garibaldi in 1867 declared his resolve to take Rome or die. Rattazzi, who was again in power, once more attempted the policy which had failed him in 1862. He ignored the obligation which bound Vittorio Emmanuele to defend the papal frontiers, and he hoped that France would tolerate a volunteer invasion. He was mistaken. Louis Napoleon interfered, and the Italian cabinet was forced to discountenance the further proceedings of the volunteers. Disturbances occurred in Rome, and Garibaldi gained a victory at Monte Rotonda Meanwhile the king appealed to the Italians to preserve his honour, and the emperor sent a new garrison to Rome. Garibaldi’s volunteers surrendered at Montana, on the 4th of November, to the French and papal troops; and, while the general was retiring to Caprera, he was arrested by order of the Italian Government at Figline. But the end was now not distant.

When the victory of Sedan overthrew the French empire in September 1870, Jules Favre declared the September convention to be at an end; Vittorio Emmanuele was released from his obligations, and on the 20th he entered Rome, which now became his capital. Pius IX. was allowed to retain the Vatican with its dependencies, the church of Sta Maria Maggiore, and Castel Gandolfo on the Alban hill. The state voted him a munificent income, and he was left in peace to play the part of a persecuted prisoner. Thus ended the emancipation of Italy; nor did the events of the following ten years alter the situation created by the king’s occupation of Rome in 1870. Vittorio Emmanuele died and was succeeded by his son Umberto in 1878. Pius IX. died the same year, and was succeeded by Leo XIII. The history of Italy during this period has been confined to internal affairs.

Bibliography.— It is difficult to indicate in a short space the most important sources of Italian as distinguished from imperial or ecclesiastical history. Muratori’s great collection of Rerum Italicarum Scriptorcs, in combination with his Dissertationes, the chronicles and other historical material published in the Archivio Storico Italiano, and the works of these detached annalists of whom the Villani are the most notable take the first rank. Next may be mentioned Muratori’s Annali d’Italia, together with Guicciardini’s Storia d'Italia, and its continuation by Carlo Botta. Troya’s Storia d'Italia del Medio Evo and Sismondi’s Républiques Italiennes form perhaps the most valuable modern contributions to the history of the whole peninsula. Ferrari’s Riυoluzioni d’Italia deserves special notice, as a work of singular vigour, though of less scientific value; and Cesare Balbo’s Sommario presents the main outlines of the subject with brevity and clearness. With regard to the history of separate provinces, it may suffice to notice the Storia Fiorentina of Machiavelli and Corio’s Storia di Milano, Capponi’s Storia della Repabblica di Firenze, Colletta’s History of Naples, Romanin’s History of Venice, Amari’s Musulmann di Sicilia, and the Stadt Rom of Gregorovius. From the point of view of papal history. Von Ranke’s History of the Popes is distinguished for exact insight into one epoch of Italian development. From the point of view of biography, Von Reumont’s Lorenzo de' Medici and Villari’s Savonarola and Machiavelli are equally instructive. From the pointof view of general culture Burckhardt’s Cultur der Renaissance in Italien, Quiuet’s Révolutions d’Italie, and J. A. Symonds’s Renaissance in Italy, 5 vols., may prove of service. No comprehensive work can be indicated for the history of Italy during the present century, though Reuchlin’s Geschichte Italiens, Treitschke’s Essay on Caxour. and Massari’s Life of Cavour supply important materials.

PART III.—LANGUAGE.

The Italian language is the language of culture in the whole of the present kingdom of Italy, in some parts of Switzerland (the canton of Ticino and part of the Grisons), in some parts of the Austrian territory (the districts of Trent and Gυrz, Istria along with Trieste, and the Dalmatian coast), and in the islands of Corsica and Malta. In the Ionian Islands, likewise, in the maritime cities of the Levant, in Egypt, and more particularly in Tunis, this literary language is extensively maintained through the numerous Italian colonies and the ancient traditions of trade.

The Italian language has its native seat and living source in Middle Italy, or more precisely Tuscany and indeed Florence. For real linguistic unity is far from existing in Italy: in some respects the variety is less in others more observable than in other countries which equally boast a political and literary unity. Thus, for example, Italy affords no linguistic contrast so violent as that presented by Great Britain with its English dialects alongside of the Celtic dialects of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, or by France with the French dialects alongside of the Celtic dialects of Brittany, not to speak of the Basque of the Pyrenees and other heterogeneous elements. The presence of not a few Slavs stretching into the district of Udine (Friuli), of Albanian, Greek, and Slav settlers in the southern provinces, with the Catalans of Alghero (Sardinia), a few Germans at Monte Rosa, and a remnant or two of other comparatively modern immigrations is not sufficient to produce any such strong contrast in the conditions of the national speech. But, on the other hand, the Neo-Latin dialects which live on side by side in Italy differ from each other much more markedly than, for example, the English dialects or the Spanish; and it must be added that, in Upper Italy especially, the familiar use [9:13:492] of the dialects is tenaciously retained even by the most cultivated classes of the population.

In the present rapid sketch of the forms of speech which occur in modern Italy, before considering the Tuscan or Italian par excellence, the language which has come to be the noble organ of modern national culture, it will be convenient to discuss (A) dialects connected in a greater or less degree with Neo-Latin systems that are not peculiar to Italy; (B) dialects which are detached from the true and proper Italian system, but form no integral part of any foreign Neo-Latin system; and (C) dialects which diverge more or less from the true Italian and Tuscan type, but which at the same time can be conjoined with the Tuscan as forming part of a special system of Neo-Latin dialects.

A. Dialects which depend in a greater or less degree on Neo-Latin systems not peculiar to Italy.

1. Franco-Provençal Dialects (see Archiviο Glottologico, iii. 61- 120).^[36. References to this journal (.-l r cΛ.) without author’s name are to papers by Professor Ascoli.] —These occupy at the present time very limited areas at the extreme north-west of the kingdom of Italy. The system stretches from the borders of Savoy and Valais into the upper basin of the Dora Baltea and into the head-valleys of the Oreo, of the northern Stura, and of the Dora Riparia. As this portion is cut off by the Alps from the rest of the system, the type is badly preserved; in the valleys of the Stura and the Dora Riparia, indeed, it is passing away and everywhere yielding to the Piedmontese.—The most salient characteristic of the Franco-Provençal is the phonetic phenomenon by which the Latin a, whether as an accented or as an unaccented final, is reduced to a thin vowel (e, i) when it follows a sound which is or has been palatal, but on the contrary is kept intact when it follows a sound of another sort. The following are examples from the Italian versant of these Alps: — Aosta : travalji, Fr. travailler; zar⅛, Fr. chercher; enteru⅞, Fr. interroger; zern∙a, Fr. chèvre; zir, Fr. cher; gljàçe, Fr. glace; vâzze, Fr. vache; alongside of sa, Fr. sel; man, Fr. main; cpôusa, Fr. épouse; erba, Fr. herbe. Val Soana: taljér, Fr. tailler; coci-sse, Fr. se coucher; ciii, Fr. chien; civra, Fr. chèvre; vacéi, Fr. vache; mângi, Fr. manche; alongside of alàr, Fr. aller; parta, Fr. porté; amdra, Fr. amère; néva, Fr. neuve. Chiamorio (Val di Lanzo): la sρranssi dla vendeta, sperantia de ilia vindicta. Vιu: pansci, pancia. Usseglio: lamüragli, muraille. —A morphological characteristic is the preservation of that paradigm which is legitimately traced back to the Latin pluperfect indicative, although possibly it may arise from a fusion of this pluperfect with the imperfect subjunctive (amaram, amarem, alongside of habueram, haberem), having in Franco-Provençal as well as in Provençal and in the continental Italian dialects in which it will be met with further on(C. 3, b ; c∕. B. 2) the function of the conditional. Val Soana: ρortdro, ρortdre, portdrct∙, portdrgnt; Aosta: riwe=Prov. agra, haberet (see Arch., iii. 31 ri). The final t in the third persons of this paradigm in the Val Soana dialect is, or was, constant in the whole conjugation, and becomes in its turn a particular characteristic in this section of the Franco-Provençal. Val Soana : éret, Lat. erat; scjt, sit; pôrtet, portdvet; portgnt, portdvgnt; Chiamorio: jéret, erat; ant dit, habent dictum; èjssount fét, habuissent factum; Viu: ehe s'minget, Ital. ehe simangi; Gravere (Val di Susa): at pensd, ha pensato; avdt, habebat; Giaglione (sources of the Dora Riparia): macidvont, mangiavano.—From the valleys, where, as has just been said, the type is disappearing, a few examples of what is still genuine Franco-Provençal may be subjoined:— Ciνreri (the name of a mountain between the Stura and the Dora Riparia), which, according to the regular course of evolution, presupposes a Latin Capraria (cf. maneri, maniera, even in the Chiamorio dialect); carasti (ciarasti), carestia, in the Viu dialect; and cintd, cantare, in that of Usseglio. From Chiamorio, lι tens, i tempi, and chejches birbes, alcune (qualche) birbe, are worthy of mention on account of the final s.

Further south, but still in the same western extremity of Piedmont, phenomena continuous with those of the Maritime Alps supply the means of passing from the Franco-Provençal to the Provençal proper, precisely as the same transition takes place beyond the Cottian Alps in Dauphiné almost in the same latitude. On the Italian side of the Cottian and the Maritime Alps the Franco-Provençal and the Provençal are connected with each other by the continuity of the phenomenon c (a pure explosive) from the Latin c before α. At Ol t lx (sources of the Dora Riparia), which seems, however, to have a rather mixed dialect, there also occurs the important Franco-Provençal phenomenon of the surd interdental (English th in thief) instead of the surd sibilant (for example ⅛⅛i = Fr. ici). At the same time α^w = avuto, takes us to the Provençal. At Fenes-γrella (upper basin of the Clusone): agü, vengii, venuto; at Oncino sources of the Po): carestio, Tero an campagno, with the Provençal o for the final unaccented a; at Sampeyre (basin of the Varaita): agu, vengu, volgu, voluto; una viestio la plus pressioso; and finally at Vinadio (basin of the southern Stura): tuöccio, tocca; los buônos, le buone, where even the diphthong is Provençal.

2. Ladin Dialects.— The purest of the Ladin dialects occur on the northern versant of the Alps in the Grisons (Switzerland), and they form the western section of the system. To this section also belongs both politically and in the matter of dialect the valley of Münster (Monastero); it sends its waters to the Adige, and might indeed consequently be geographically considered Italian, but it slopes towards the north. In the central section of the Ladin zone there are two other valleys which likewise drain into tributaries of the Adige, but are also turned towards the north,—the valleys of the Gardena and the Gadera, in which occurs the purest Ladin now extant in the central section. The valleys of Münster, the Gardena, and the Gadera may thus be regarded as inter-Alpine, and the question may be left open whether or not they should be included even geographically in Italy. There remain, however, within what are strictly Italian limits, the valleys of the Noce, the A visio, the Cordevole, and the Boite, and the upper basin of the Piave (Comelico), in which are preserved Ladin dialects, more or less pure, belonging to the central section of the Ladin zone or belt. To Italy belongs, further, the whole eastern section of the zone composed of the Friulian territories. It is by far the most populous, containing about 500,000 inhabitants. The Friulian region is bounded on the north by the Carnic Alps, south by the Adriatic, and west by the eastern rim of the upper basin of the Piave and the Livenza; while on the east it stretches into the eastern versant of the basin of the Isonzo. —The Ladin element is further found in greater or less degree throughout an altogether Cis-Alpine “amphizone,” and more particularly in the head valley of the Ticino and the head valley of the Mera on the Lombardy versant, and in the Val Fiorentina and central Cadore on the Venetian versant. The valleys of Bormio present a special and conspicuous phase of Ladino-Lombard connexions, and the Ladin element is clearly observable in the most ancient examples of the dialects of the Venetian estuary (JrcΛ., i. 448-4/3).— The main characteristics by which the Ladin type is determined may be summarized as follows :—(1) the guttural of the formulae c + α and g + a passes into a palatal; (2) the l of the formulae pl, cl, kx., is preserved; (3) the s of the ancient terminationsis preserved; (4) the accented e in position breaks into a diphthong; (5) the accented o in position breaks into a diphthong; (6) the form of the diphthong which comes from short accented o or from the o of position is ue (whence ue, ö); (7) long accented e and short accented i break into a diphthong, the purest form of which is sounded ei; (8) the accented a tends, within certain limits, to change into e, especially if preceded by a palatal sound; (9) the long accented u is represented by u. These characteristics are all foreign to true and genuine Italian. 0drn, carne; spelunca, spelunca; clefs, claves; fτιormas, formae; infiern, inferno; or di, hordeo; möd, modo; plain, pleno; pail, pilo; quael, quale; piir, puro—may be taken as examples from the Upper Engadine (western section of the zone). The following are examples from the central and eastern sections on the Italian versant :—

a . Central Section.— Basin of the Noce: examples of the dialect of Fondo: cavil, capillo; pescadôr, piscatore; pluévia, pluvia (plovia); pluma (dial, of Val de Rumo: pl'ôvia, plumo)·, vécla, vetula; cdntcs, cantas. The dialects of this basin are disappearing.—· Basin of the Avxsio : examples of the dialect of the Val di Fassa: earn, carne; ceier, cadere (cad-jere); vdca, vacca; féréa, furca; glézia (jé&ia), ecclesia; tèglje (aeje), oculi; cans, canes; rdmes, rami; teila, tela; néif, nive; ca∙ssa, coxa. The dialects of this basin which are further west than Fassa are gradually being merged in the Veneto-Tridentine dialects.— Basin of the Cordevole : here the district of Livinal-Lungo (Buchenstein) is Austrian politically, and that of Rocca d’Agordo and Laste is Italian. Examples of the dialect of Livinal-Lungo: carié, Ital. caricare; canté, cantatus; ôgle, oculo; catis, canes; cavéis, capilli; viérm, verme; fuoc, foco; avéi, habere; néi, nive.— Basin of the Boite : here the district of Ampezzo (Heiden) is politically Austrian, that of Oltrechiusa Italian. Examples of the dialect of Ampezzo are casa, casa; candéra, candela; forces, furcae, pl.; séntes, sentis. It is a decadent form.— Upper Basin of the Piave : dialect of the Comelico: césa, casa; cen (éan), cane; caljé, caligario; bos, boves; naevo, novo; loego, loco.

b . Eastern Section or Friulian Region.— Here there still exists a flourishing “Ladinity,” but at the same time it tends towards Italian, particularly in the want both of the e from d and of the ii (and consequently of the δ). Examples of the Udine variety: carr, carro; cavdi, caballo; castiél, castello; force, furca; clar, claro; glaç, glacie; plan, piano; colors, colores; lungs, longi, pl.; dénis, debes; vidiél, vitello; fiésfc, festa; puéss, possum; cuétt, cocto; udrdi, hordeo.—The most ancient specimens of the Friulian dialect belong to the 14th century (see Arch., iv. 188 sqq.).

B. Dialects which are detached from the true and proper Italian system, but form no integral part of any foreign Neo-Latin system [9:13:493] 1. Here first of all is the extensive system of the dialects usually called Gallo-Italian, although that designation cannot be considered sufficiently distinctive, since it would be equally applicable to the Franco-Provençal (A. 1) and the Ladin (A. 2). The system is subdivided into four great groups,—(a) the Ligurian, (δ) the Piedmontese, (c) the Lombard, and (d) the Emilian,— the names furnishing on the whole sufficient indication of the localization and limits.— These groups, considered more particularly in their more pronounced varieties, differ greatly from each other; and, in regard to the Ligurian, it was even denied until very recently that it belongs to this system at all (see Arch., ii. 111 sqq.).— Characteristic of the Piedmontese, the Lombard, and the Emilian is the continual elision of the unaccented final vowels except a (e.g., Turinese öj, oculo; Milanese vgç, voce; Faenzan red, rete), but the Ligurian does not keep them company (e.g., Genovese o<j<Ju, oculo; vρze, voce). In the Piedmontese and Emilian there is further a tendency to eliminate the protonic vowels—a tendency much more pronounced in the second of these groups than in the first (e.g., Pied, dné, danaro; viin, vicino; Faenzan fnocc, finocchio; dspraziori). This phenomenon involves in large measure that of the prothesis of a; as, e.g., in Turinese and Faenzan armor, rumore; Faenzan alvé, levare; &c. U for the long accented Latin w and ö for the short accented Latin o (and even within certain limits the Latin ό of position) are common to the Piedmontese, the Ligurian, and the Lombard: e.g., Turinese and Milanese, dur, and Genovese diiu, duro; Turinese and Genovese, move, and Milanese möo, movere; Piedmontese dörm, dorm6; Milanese, volta, volta. Ei for the long accented Latin e and for the short accented Latin i is common to the Piedmontese and the Ligurian, and even extends over a large part of Emilia: e.g., Turinese and Genovese, avéi, habere, Bolognese, avéir; Turinese and Genovese, beive, bibere, Bolognese, beir. In Emilia ci occurs also in the formulae én, ent, emp; e.g., Bolognese and Modenese bein, sρla- méiht. The system shows a repugnance throughout to ie for the short accented Latin e (as it occurs in Italian piede, &c. ); in other words, this diphthong has died out, but in various fashions: Piedmontese and Lombard deç, dieci; Genovese dele; Faenzan diρ. The greater part of the phenomena indicated above have “Gallic” counterparts too evident to require to be specially pointed out. One of the most important traces of Gallic or Celtic reaction is the reduction of the Latin accented a into e (a, &c. ), of which phenomenon, however, no certain indications have as yet been found in the Ligurian group. On the other hand it remains, in the case of very many of the Piedmontese dialects, in the é of the infinitives of the first conjugation: porté, portare, &c.; and numerous vestiges of it are still found in Lombardy (e.g., in Bassa Brianza: and£, andato; guard;!, guardato; sae, sale; see Arch. i. 296-298, 536). Emilia also preserves it in very extensive use: Modenese ander, andare; arivéda, arrivata; pcρ, pace; Faenzan parlé, pariare and pariato; parléda, pariata; chcs, caso; &c. The phenomenon, in company with other Gallo-Italian and more specially Emilian characteristics, extends to the valley of the Metauro, and even passes to the opposite side of the Apennines, spreading on both banks of the head stream of the Tiber and through the valley of the Chiane: hence the types artrovér, ritrovare, portéto, portato, &c., of the Perιιgian and Aretine dialects (see infra C. 3, δ). In the phenomenon of d passing into e (as indeed, the Gallo-Italic evolution of other Latin vowels) special distinctions would require to be drawn between bases in which a (not standing in position) precedes a non-nasal consonant (e.g., amdto), and those which have a before a nasal: and in the latter case there would be a non-positional subdivision (e. g., fame, pane) and a positional one (e.g., qudnto, amândo, edmpo); see Arch. i. 293 sqq. This leads us to the nasals, a category of sounds comprising other Gallo-Italic characteristics. There occurs more or less widely, throughout all the sections of the system, and in different gradations, that “velar” nasal in the end of a syllable (pah, man·, cdhta, moût) which may be weakened into a simple nasalizing of a vowel (pd, &c.) or even grow completely inaudible (Bergaτnese pa, pane; padrιi, padrone; tep, tempo; met, mente; mut, monte; pût, ponte; ριica, punta, i.e., “puncta”), where Celtic and especially Irish analogies and even the frequent use of t for nt, &c., in ancient Umbrian orthography occur to the mind. Then λve have the faucal n by which the Ligurian and the Piedmontese Cana, luma, &c. ) are connected with the group which we call Franco-Provençal (A. 1).— We pass on to the “Gallic” resolution of the nexus ct (e.g., facto, fajto, fajtjo, fait, fac; teclo, tejto, tejtjo, teil, tec) which invariably occurs in the Piedmontese, the Ligurian, and the Lombard: Pied, fail, Lig. fajtu, faetu, Lombard fac ; Pied, téit, Lig. téitu, Lorn, tec·, &c. Here it is to be observed that besides the Celtic analogy the Umbrian also helps us (adveitu = ad-vecto; &c.); and it is further most noteworthy that the Celtic and Umbrian analogies lead us to that fusion of the ct series with the pt series (Irish secht, Welsh scith, septem; Umbrian, screhto, screihtor, scriptum, scripti) by which is explained the serve, scripto, of the ancient Milanese, scric 'dra, scriptura, of the modern; just as also Provençal has escrich (i.e., escric).— The Piedmontese and Ligurian come close to each other, more especially by the regular dropping of the d both primary and secondary, a phenomenon common in French (as Piedmontese and Ligurian rle, ridere; Piedmontese pué, potare; Genoese naeghe = nâighe, nâtiche, &c.). The Lombard type, or more correctly the type which has become the dominant one in Lombardy (Arch., i. 305-6, 310-11), is more sparing in this respect; and still more so is the Emilian. In the Piedmontese is also found that other purely Gallic resolution of the guttural between two vowels by which we have the types brdja, mania, over against the Ligurian brdga, rndnega, braca, manica.—Among the phonetic phenomena peculiar to the Ligurian is a continual reduction of l into r and the subsequent dropping of this r between vowels and at the end of words in the modern Genoese; just as happens also with the primary r: thus dû = dunir≈ dolore, &c. Characteristic of the Ligurian, but not without analogies in Upper Italy even (Arch., ii. 157-8), is the resolution of^y', bj,fj intoc, j, S: cii, pin, plus; rdjja, rabbia, rabies; M, fiore. Finally, the sounds 5 and 5 have a very wide range in Ligurian (Arch., ii. 158-59). The reduction of s into h occurs in the Bergamo dialects: hira, sera; groh, grosso; cahtél, castello (see also B. 2).—A general phenomenon in Gallo-Italic phonetics which also comes to have an inflexional importance is that by which the unaccented final i has an-influence on the accented vowel. This enters into a series of phenomena which even extends into southern Italy; but in the Gallo-Italic there are particular resolutions which agree well with the general connexions of this system. The following plural forms may be quoted: Genoese bôin, from bon-i; tr6in from tron-i, tuoni; Milanese quist, from quist-i (sing, quest), questi; mis from mes-i, mesi (sing, mes) ; Bolognese rin, from rcn-i, regni (sing, ren); cf. Arch., i. 540-41.—Among morphological peculiarities the first place may be given to the Bolognese sipa (scppa), because, thanks to Dante and others, it has acquired great literary celebrity. It really signifies “sia” (sim, sit), and is an analogical form fashioned on aepa, a legitimate continuation of the corresponding forms of the other auxiliary (habeam, habeat), which is still heard in clime aepa purt£, ch ’ lu aepa p>urtf, ch’io abbia portato, ch’egli abbia portato. Next may be noted the third person singular in -p of the perfect of esse and of the first conjugation in the Forli dialect (fop, fu; mandip, mando; &c). This also must be analogical, and due to a legitimate ep, ebbe (see Arch., ii. 401, and compare fobbe, fu, in the dialect of Camerino, in the province of Macerata, as well as the Spanish analogy of tuve estuve formed after hübe). Lastly, in the domain of syntax, may be added the tendency to repeat the pronoun (e.g., ti te edntet of the Milanese, which really is tu tu cdntas-tu, equivalent merely to “cantas”), a tendency at work in the Emilian and Lombard, but more particularly pronounced in the Piedmontese. With this the corresponding tendency of the Celtic languages has been more than once and with justice compared; here it may be added that the Milanese nun, apparently a simple form for “noi,” is really a compound or reduplication in the manner of the ni-ni, its exact counterpart in the Celtic tongues. —The literary documents of this system go back as far as the end of the 13th century in the Milanese poems of Fra Bonvicino da Riva and the Rime Genovcsi (Arch., ii. 161-312).

2. Sardinian Dialects.— These are three—the Logudoreseor central, the Campidanese or southern, and the Gallurese or northern. The third certainly indicates a Sardinian basis, but is strangely disturbed by the intrusion of other elements, among which the Southern Corsican (Sartene) is by far the most copious. The other two are homogeneous, and have great affinity with each other; the Logudorese comes more particularly under consideration here.—The pure Sardinian vocalism has this peculiarity that each accented vowel of the Latin appears to be retained without alteration. Consequently there are no diphthongs representing simple Latin vowels; nor does the rule hold good which is true for so great a proportion of the Romance languages that the representatives of the é and the Ï on the one hand and those of the ύ and the ½ on the other are normally coincident. Hence plenu (e); deghe, decem (e); binu, vino (i)∙,pilu (ï); flore (ô); roda, rota (S); duru (ü); nughc, nuce (ü). The unaccented vowels keep their ground well, as has already been seen in the case of the finals by the examples adduced.—Thes and t of the ancient termination are preserved, though not constantly: trcs* onus, passades annos, plantas, fafhes, facis, tenemus·, mulghet, rnitt-ghent. — The formulae ce, ci, ge, gi may be represented by ehe (ke), &c.; but this appearance of special antiquity is really illusory (see Arch., ii. 143-4). The nexus cl, &c., may be maintained in thebeginning of words (claru, plus); but if they are in the body of the word they usually undergo resolutions which, closely related though they be to those of Italian, sometimes bring about very singular results (e.g. ulare, which by the intermediate forms uscare, usjare leads back to usclare — ustlarc — ustulare). NA is the representative of nj (testim6niu &c.); and lj is reduced to i alone (e.g., mé&us, melius; Campidanese mellus). For ll a frequent substitute is (Id·, massiclcla, maxilla, &c. Quite characteristic is the continual labialization of the formulae qua, gua, cu, gu, &c.; e.g., ebba, equa; sambenc, sanguine (see Arch., ii. 143). The dropping of the primary d (roere, rodere, &c.) but not of the secondary (finidu, sanidade, madum) is frequent. Characteristic also is the Logudorese prothesis of i before [9:13:494] the initial s followed by a consonant (iscamnu, istella., ispada), like the prothesis of e in Spain and in France (see Arch., iii. 447 sqq.). —In the order of the present discussion it is in connexion with this territory that we are for the first time led to consider those phonetic changes in words of which the cause is merely syntactical or transitory, and chiefly those passing accidents which occur to the initial consonant through the historically legitimate or the merely analogical action of the final sound that precedes it. The general explanation of such phenomena reduces itself to this that, given the intimate syntactic relation of two words, the initial consonant of the second retains or modifies its character as it would retain or modify it if the two words were one. The Celtic languages are especially distinguished by this peculiarity; and among the dialects of Upper Italy the Bergamasc oilers a clear example. This dialect is accustomed to drop the v, whether primary or secondary, between vowels in the individual vocables (cad, cavare; fda, fava, &c.), but to preserve it if it is preceded by a consonant (serva, &c.).—And similarly in syntactic combination we have, for example, de i, di vino; but ol vi, il vino. Insular, southern, and central Italy furnish a large number of such phenomena; for Sardinia we shall simply cite a single class, which is at once obvious and easily explained, viz., that represented by su oe, il bove, alongside of sos boes, i buoi (c∕. Here, bibere; erba).— The article is derived from ipse instead of from ille: su sos, sa sas, —again a geographical anticipation of Spain, which in the Catalan of the Balearic islands still preserves the article from ipse.— A special connexion with Spain exists besides in the nomine type of inflexion, which is constant among the Sardinians (Spanish nomne, &c., whence nombre, &c. ), nomen, no-nιene, rdmine, aeramine, legιιmene, &c. (see Arch., ii. 429 sqq.).— Especially noteworthy in the conjugation of the verb is the paradigm cautère, cautères, &c., timbre, timbres, &c., precisely in the sense of the imperfect subjunctive (cf. A. 1; cf. C. 3 δ). Next comes the analogical and almost corrupt diffusion of the -si of the ancient strong perfects (such a&posi, rosi), by which cantesi, timesi (cantavi, timui), dolfesi, dolui, are reached. Proof of the use and even the abuse of the strong perfects is afforded, however, by the participles and the infinitives of the category to which belong the following examples: ténnidu, tenuto; pàrfidu,, pareo; bdlfidtι, valso; ténnere-, bdlere, &c. (Arch., ii. 432-33). The future, finally, shows the unagglutinated periphrasis: hapo a mandigare (ho a mangiarc = manger-ό); as indeed the unagglutinated forms of the future and the conditional occur in ancient vernacular texts of other Italian districts.—There are documents of the Sardinian dialect going back as far as the middle of the 12th century.

C. Dialects which diverye more or less from the genuine Italian or Tuscan type, but τvhieh at the same time can be conjoined with the Tuscan as forming part of a special system of Neo-Latin dialects.

1. Venetian.— Between “Venetian” and “Venetie” several distinctions must be drawn (Arch., i. 391 sqq.). At the present day the population of the Venetian cities is ‘^Venetian” in language, but the country districts are in various ways Venetie.^[37. On this point see the chapter, “La teιτa forma veneta considerata in ispecie ne' suoi rapport: con la sezione centrale della zona ladina,” in Arch., i. 406-47.] The ancient language of Venice itself and of its estuary was not a little different from that of the present time; and the Ladin vein was particularly evident (see A. 2). A more purely Italian vein —the historical explanation of which presents an attractive problem—has ultimately gained the mastery and determined the “Venetian” type which has since diffused itself so vigorously.— In the Venetian, then, we do not find the most distinctive characteristics of the dialects of Upper Italy comprised under the denomination Gallo-Italic (see B. 1),—neither the ii nor the (i, nor the velar and faucal nasals, nor the Gallic resolution of the ct, nor the frequent elision of unaccented vowels, nor the great redundancy of pronouns. On the contrary, the pure Italian diphthong of <5 (e.g., cu6r) is heard, and the diphthong of ê is in full currency (diéze, dieci, &c.). Nevertheless the Venetian approaches the type of Northern Italy, or diverges notably from that of Central Italy, by the following phonetic phenomena :—the ready elision of primary or secondary cl (eruo, crudo; séa, seta, &c. ); the regular - reduction of the surd into the sonant guttural (e.g., cuogo, Ital. cuoco, coquus); the pure c in the resolution of cl (e.g., cave, clave; oréca, auricula); the i for éj (éôvene, I tai. giovane); ç for S and c (péçe, Ital. pesce; çiél, Ital. cielo). Lj preceded by any vowel, primary or secondary, except i, gives j: faméja, familia. No Italian dialect is more averse than the Venetian to the doubling of consonants.—In the morphology the use of the 3d singular for the 3d plural also, and the analogical participle in eslo (taécsto, I tai. taciuto, &c.; see Arch., iv. 393 sqq.) are particularly noteworthy. A curious double relic of Ladin influence is the interrogative type represented by the example crédis-tu, credis tu,—where apart from the interrogation ti crcdi would be used.—The texts of the Venetian vernacular take us back to the first half of the 13th century. To the beginning of the 14th belongs the Τrattato “de regimine rec toris" of Fra Paolino, also in the Venetian dialect. For other ancient sources relating to Venice, the estuary of Venice, Verona, and Padua, see Arch., i. 448, 465, 421-22; iii. 245-47.

2. Corsican.— If the “Venetian,” in spite of its peculiar “Italianity,” has naturally special points of contact with the other dialects of Upper Italy (B. 1), the Corsican in like manner, particularly in its southern varieties, has special points of contact with Sardinian proper (B. 2). Thus for example, in boglio leche lu bunnetnι (voglio lasciar la gonnella) from a song of Fiumorban Corsican there is a phonetic phenomenon (ba from gu) which reveals a connexion with Sardinian proper, as well as a morphological phenomenon which implies the same relation, since lechc must be a verb of the first conjugation (lagdr e in Upper Italy; see, for example, Arch., i. 546) conformed to the analogy of strong verbs as found in Sardinian in the case of ndrrcre, narrare, or, for a verb of the fourth conjugation, in Corsican rêne, Sardinian bénnere =venire.—In general, it is in the southern section of the island, which, geographically even, is farthest removed from Tuscany, that the most characteristic forms of speech are found. The unaccented vowels are undisturbed; but w for the Tuscan o is common to almost all the island,—an insular phenomenon par excellence which connects Corsica with Sardiniaancl with Sicily, and indeed with Liguria also. So also -i for the Tuscan -e (latti, latte; li cateni, le catene), which prevails chiefly in the southern section, is also found in Southern Sardinian, and is common to Sicily. It is needless to add that this tendency to u and i manifests itself, more or less decidedly, also within the words. Corsican, too, avoids the diphthongs of ti and ti (ρe, cri; cori,foraf, but, unlike Sardinian, it treats t and ⅛ in the Italian fashion: beju, bibo; peveru, piper; pesci; noci, nuces.—It is one of its characteristics to reduce a to e in the formula ar + a consonant (chérnc, bérba, &c.), which should be compared particularly with the Emilian examples of the same phenomenon (Arch., ii. 133, 144-50). But the gerund in -endu of the first conjugation (turnemlu, lagrimendu, &c.) must on the contrary be considered as a phenomenon of analogy, as it is especially recognized in the Sardinian dialects, to all of which it is common (see Arch., ii. 133). And the same is most probably the case with forms of the present participle }ikemerchente, mercante, in spite of enzi and innenzi (anzi, innanzi), in which latter forms there may probably be traced the effect of the Neo-Latin i which availed to reduce the t of the Latin ante ; alongside of them we find also anzi and nantu. —In Southern Corsican dr for ll is conspicuous—a phenomenon which also connects Corsica with Sardinia, Sicily, and a good part of Southern Italy (see C. 2; and Arch. ii. 135, &c). An acute observer (Falcucci) has asserted that even the phenomena of rn and nd both changing into nn are found in certain veins of Southern Corsican; but he has given no examples. The former of these would connect Corsican with Sardinian (coτnι, cornu; carre, carne, &c.); the latter more especially with Sicily, &c., though it is not unknown even in Sardinia (Arch., ii.142, 143).—As to phonetic phenomena connected with syntax, already noticed in B. 2, space admits the following examples only: Cors, na vella, una bella, e bella (cbbélla, et bella); lujallu, lo gallo, gran ghiallu∙, cf. Arch., ii. 136 (135, 150). As Tomrnaseo has already noted, -one is for the Corsicans not less than for the French a termination of diminution: e.g., fratedronu, fratellino.—In the first person of the conditional the b is maintained (e.g., farebc, farei), as even at Rome and elsewhere. Lastly, the series of Corsican verbs of the derivative ordeι∙ which run alongside of the Italian series of the original order, and may be represented by the example dissiρcghja, dissipa (Falcucci), is to be compared with the Sicilian series represented by cuadiari, riε-caldare, curρidri, colpire (Arch., ii. 151).

3. Dialects of Sicily and of the Neapolitan Provinces.— Here the territories on both sides of the Strait of Messina will first be treated together, chiefly with the view of noting their common linguistic peculiarities.—Characteristic then of these parts, as compared with Upper Italy and even with Sardinia, is, generally speaking, the tenacity of the explosive elements of the Latin bases, (cf. Arch., ii. 154, &c.). Not that these consonants are constantly preserved uninjured; their degradations, and especially the Neapolitan degradation of the surd into the sonant, are even more frequent than is shown by the dialect as written, but their disappearance is comparatively rather rare; and even the degradations, whether regard be had to the conjunctures in which they occur or to their specific quality, are very different from those of the dialects of Upper Italy. Thus, the t between vowels ordinarily remains intact in Sicilian and Neapolitan (e.g., Sicil. sita, Neap, seta, seta, where in the dialects of Upper Italy we should have scda, scaj∙, and in the Neapolitan dialects it is reduced to d when it is preceded by n or r (e.g., viende, vento), which is precisely a collocation in which the t would be maintained intact in Upper Italy. The d, on the other hand, is not resolved by elision, but by its reduction tor (e.g., Sicil. virire, Neap, dialects verb, vedere), a phenomenon which has been frequently compared, perhaps with too little caution, with the d passing into?·« (d)in the Umbrian inscriptions. The Neapolitan reduction of nt into ml has its analogies in the reduction of no (nk) into ng, and of mp into mb, which is also a feature of the Neapolitan dialects, and in that of ns into n£; and here and there [9:13:495] we even find a reduction of nf into mb (nf, nr, nb, mb), both in Sicilian and Neapolitan (e.g., at Casteltemιini in Sicily ’ rnbiemu, inferno, and in the Abrιιzzi cumbonn', 'mbonn', confondere, in-fondere). Here we find ourselves in a series of phenomena to which it may seem that some special contributions were furnished by Oscan and Umbrian (nt, mp, no into nd, &c.), but for which more secure and general, and so to say “isothermal,” analogies are found in modern Greek and Albanian. The Sicilian does not appear to fit in here as far as the formulae nt and mρ are concerned; it rather agrees with the Neapolitan through rt passing into rd ; and it may even be said to go counter to this tendency by reducing nj to nc (e.g., punciri, pungere). Nay, even in the passing of the sonant into the surd, the Neapolitan dialects would yield special and important contributions (nor is even the Sicilian limited to the case just specified), among which we will only mention the change of d between vowels into iin the last syllable of proparoxytones (e.g., ummetv, umido). From these series of sonants changing into surds comes a peculiar feature of the southern dialects.—A pretty common characteristic is the regular progressive assimilation by which nd is reduced to nn, mb to mm, and even nv also to mm (nν, nb, mb, mm), e.g., Sicil. iinniri, Neap, Sénnere, scendere; Sicil. chiummu, Neap, chiumme, piombo; Sicil. and Neap, 'mmidia, invidia. As belonging to this class of phenomena the Palaeo-Italic analogy (nd into nn, n), of which the Umbrian furnishes special evidence, readily suggests itself.—Another important common characteristic is the reduction of p>j, bj, fj, to c (kj), j, S (<f. the Genoese; B. 1), whence, c.g., Sicil. chianu, Neap, chiane, piano (piano, pljano, pjano); Sicil. sicca, Neap, secca, sepia; Sicil. rafja, Neap, arrafâa, rabbia; Sicil. Suri (curi), Neap. Sore, fiore.—Further is to be noted the tendency to the sibilation of ce, ci for which Sicil. jazzu, ghiaccio, and Neap. lizele, lecito, may serve as examples (Arch. , ii. 149),—a tendency more particularly betrayed in Upper Italy.—There is a common inclination also to elide the initial unaccented palatal vowel, and to prefix a, especially before r (this second tendency is found likewise in Southern Sardinian, &c.; see Arch., ii. 138); e.g., Sicil. ’nténniri, Neap, ’ndénuere, intendere; Sicil. arricamAri, Neap, arragamure, ricamare (see Arch., ii. 150).—In complete contrast to the tendency to get rid of double consonants which has been particularly noted in Venetian (0. 1), wehere come to the great division of Italy where the tendency grows strong to gemination (or the doubling of consonants); and the Neapolitan in this respect goes farther than the Sicilian (c.g., Sicil. doppu, dopo; 'nsemmula, insieme, in-simul; Neap, dellecato, dilicato; umrneto, umido; débbole). — As to the phonetic phenomena connected with the syntax (see B. 2), it is sufficient to cite such Sicilian examples as ni&una ronna, nesuna donna, alongside of c' é donni, c’ è donne; einen jorna, cinque giorni, alongside of chiιi ghiorna, pin giorni; and the Neapolitan la vocca, la bocca, alongside of a bocca a bocca, ad buccam, &c.

We now proceed to the special consideration, first, of the Sicilian and, secondly, of the dialects of the mainland.

a . Sicilian. — The Sicilian vocalism is conspicuously etymological. Though differing in colour from the Tuscan, it is not less noble, and between the two there are remarkable points of contact. The dominant variety ignores the diphthongs of é and of d, as it has been seen that they are ignored in Sardinia (B. 2), and here also the t and the it appear intact; but the é and the ύ arc fittingly represented by i and u ; and with equal symmetry unaccented e and o are reproduced by i and u. Examples: téni, tiene; n<5vu, nuovo; pilu, pelo;yuyii, giogo; cridiri, credere; sira, sera; υina, vena; suli, il sole; ura, ora. The é and ό of position are represented by c and o (υermi, verme; nuveφlu, novello; morli, la moi te; <wnt<), and thus normally they correspond to the open c and o of the Tuscan. And if in some cases the Sicilian appears to be exceptional (stidda, stella; vinniri, vendere; furma, &c.), it usually corresponds even in this with the Tuscan, where also we find the same apparent exception of the closed instead of the open vowel (stella, vendere, forma, &c., Arch., ii. 146).—In the evolution of the consonants it is enough to add here the change of lj into ghj (c.g., figghiu, figlio) and of ll into φl (e.g., gad<lu, gallo).

b . Dialects of the Neapolitan Mainland. — The Calabrian (by which is to be understood more particularly the vernacular group of the two Further Calabria4) may be fairly considered as a continuation of the Sicilian type, as is seen from the following examples :— cc ∣ ri, cuore; j)etra; fιmmina, femina; vιιci, voce; onuri, onore; figghiu, figlio; spaφlc, spalle; trizza, treccia (here thed of the nexus nd, however, is not subject to the assimilation which is common to Sicilian and Neapolitan in general: e.g., quandu, cangendu, piangendo). Even the Λ iorS≈fj, as in hurt (Sicil. Suri, fiore), which is characteristic in Calabrian, has its forerunners in the island (see Arch., ii. 456). Along the coast of the extreme south of Italy, when once we have passed the interruptions caused by the Basilisco type (so called from the Basilicata), the Sicilian vocalism again presents itself in the Otrantine, especially in the seaboard of Capo di Leuca. In the Lecce variety of the Otrantine the vocalism which has just been described as Sicilian also keeps its ground in the main (cf. Morosi, Arch., iv.): sira, sera; lcitu, oliveto; pila ; ura, ora; dιιlurβ, Nay more, the Sicilian phenomenon of lj into ghj (figghiu, figlio, &c.) is well marked in Terra d’Otranto and also in Terra di Bari, and even extends through the Capitanata and the Basilicata (cf. D’Ovidio, Arch., iv. 159-60). As strongly marked in the Terra d’Otranto is the insular phenomenon of ll into dd (clr), which is also very widely distributed through the Neapolitan territories on the eastern side of the Apennines, sending outshoots even to the Abruzzo. But in Terra d’Otranto we are already in the midst of the diphthongs of é and of o, both non-positional and positional, the development or permanence of which is determined by the quality of the unaccented final vowel,—as generally happens in the dialects of the south. The diphthongal product of the t>, and hence also of the 6 of position, is here uc. The following are examples from the Lecce variety of the dialect: core, pl. cueri; metu, mieti, mete, mieto, mieti, miete (Lat. metere); sentm, sienti, sente; olu, uéli, ola, volo, voli, vola; mordu, rnuerdi, morde. The we recalls the fundamental reduction which belongs to the Gallic (not to speak of the Spanish) regions, and stretches through the Terra di Bari, where there are other diphthongs curiously suggestive of the Gallic: e.g., at Bitonto alongside of lueche, luogo, mienne, sonno, we have the oi and the ai from i or e of the previous phase (vecoine, vicino), and the αtt from o of the previous phase (anaure., onore), besides a diphthongal disturbance of the Here also occurs the change of A into an e more or less pure (thus, at Cisternino, scunsulête, sconsolata; at Canosa di Puglia, arniête, arrivata; n-ghèpe, “in capa,” that is, in capo); to which may be added the continual weakening or elision of the unaccented vowels not only at the end but in the body of the word (thus, at Bitonto, vendett, spranz). A similar type meets us as we cross into Capitanata (Cerignola: facAive, facera; affêise, offese; sfazidnne, soddisfazione; n'-ghêipe, in capo; 'nzulteite, insultata; arrajé/ètç, arrabbiato); such forms being apparently the outposts of the Abruzzan, which, however, is only reached through the Molise—a district not very populous even now, and still more thinly peopled in bygone days—whose prevailing forms of speech in some measure interrupt the historical continuity of the dialects of the Adriatic versant, presenting, as it were, an irruption from the other side of the Apennines. In the head valley of the Molise, at Agnone, the legitimate precursors of the Abruzzan vernaculars reappear (fatoica, fatica; perdoiva, perdeva; voire, vero; paina, pen a; segneura; cheurg∙, Sellericte, scellerati, where, however, the disturbance of the a is only occasional, i.e., is dependent on the i formerly heard in the end of the word; cf. maltrattata, sperava, &c. ). The following are pure Abruzzan examples. (1) From Bucchianico (Abruzzo Citeriore): veive, vivo; rrajξ, re; allaure, allora; craune, corona; circhê, cercare; mêle, male; grênnç, grande; quênnc ; but , nsultate, insultata; strade, strada (where again it is seen that the reduction of the A depends on the quality of the final unaccented vowel, and that it is not produced exclusively by i, which would give rise to a further reduction: scillarite, scellerati; umpire, impâri). (2) From Pratola Peligna (Abruzzo Ulteriore II.): muje, mia; , naure, onore; 'njuriéte, inguriata; dcsperëte, disperata (alongside of vennecA, vendi-care). It almost appears that a continuity with Emilian ought to be established across the Marches (where another irruption of greater “Italianity” has taken place: a third of more dubious origin has been indicated for Venice, C. 1); see Arch., ii. 445. A negative characteristic for Abruzzan is theabseuce of c≈pj and of S=fj ; and the reason seems evident. Here the ρj and/? themselves appear to be modem or of recent reduction,—the ancient formulae sometimes occurring intact (as in the Bergamasc for Upper Italy), e.g.,plAnje and ρrAnje alongside of ρidnje, pragnere.^[38. So again even still pleuve and prove, piove, which suggests a fine Latinisιn of another sort still retained,— nengue, ningucre; so that in the most ancient chronicle of Aquila (str. 437) the reading sep , oveva o nengueva is truly dialectic.··«] To the south of the Abruzzi begins and in the Abruzzi grows prominent that contrast in regard to the fonnulae alt ald (resolved in the Neapolitan and Sicilian into aut, &c., just as in the Piedmontese, &c.) by which the types aldare, altare, and calle, caldo, are reached.—For the rest, when the condition and connexions of the vowel system still retained by so large a proportion of the dialects of the eastern versant of the Neapolitan Apennines, and the difference which exists in regard to the preservation of the unaccented vowels between the Ligurian and the Gallo-Italic forms of speech on the other versant of the northern Apennines, are considered, one cannot fail to see how much justice there is in the longitudinal oj Apenninian partition of the Italian dialects indicated by Dante. ^- But, to continue, in the Basilicata, which drains into the Gulf of Taranto, and may be said to lie within the Apennines, not only is the elision of final unaccented vowels a prevailing characteristic; there are also frequent elisions of the unaccented vowels within the word. Thus at Matera: sintenn lafemn chessa c6s, sen-tendo la femina questa cosa; disprât, disperata; at Saponara di Grumento: uomnn’ scilrati, uomini scellerati; mnetta, vendetta.— But even if we return to the Mediterranean versant and, leaving the Sicilian type of the Calabrias, retrace our steps till we pass into the Neapolitan pure and simple, we find that even in Naples the unaccented final vowels behave badly, the labial turning to } (bflle, bello) and even the a (bella) being greatly weakened. And here [9:13:496] occurs a Palaeo-Italic instance which is worth mention: while Latin was accustomed, to drop the u of its nominative only in presence of r (gencr from *gener-u-s, vir from *vir-u-s; cf. the Tuscan or Italian apocopated forms véner= vénere, wwzer=vennero, &c. ), Oscan and. Umbrian go much further: Oscan, hurz=*hort-u-s, Lat. hortus; Umbr. pihaz, piatus; cmρs, emptus, &c. In Umbrian inscriptions we find u alternating with the a of the nom. sing. fem. and plur. neut. In complete contrast with the Sicilian vocalism is the Neapolitan e for unaccented and particularly final i of the Latin and Neo-Latin or Italian phases (e.g., viene, vieni; cf. infra}, to say nothing further of the regular diphthongization, within certain limits, of accented e or o in position (apierte, aperto, fem. aρerla; muorte, morto, fem. morta, &c.).—Characteristic also of the Neapolitan are certain insertions of vowels to obviate certain collocations: hence 6dejo for odio, or more curiously ά votre, altro (i.c., aultro, autro, as in Upper Italy, hence dotro, av-g-tro) or cu6vete, colto (Le., cuolto, cu0uto, cu0υ-g-to}. In the quasi-morphological domain it is to be noted how the Siculo-Calabrian u for the ancient ό and ⅛, and the Siculo-Calabrian i for the ancient é, t, are also still found in the Neapolitan, and, in particular, that they alternate with o and e in a manner that is determined by the difference of termination. Thus cosetore, cucitore, pl. coseture (i.e., coseturi, the -i passing into e in keeping with the Neapolitan characteristic already mentioned); spose, sposo, pl. spuse; noce, noce, pl. nuce ; crede, io credo; cride (*cridi), tu credi; crede, egli crede; nigre, but negra.

Passing now to a cursory mention of purely morphological phenomena, we begin with that form which is referred to the Latin pluperfect (see A. 1, B. 2), but which here too performs the functions of the conditional. Examples from the living dialects of (1) Calabria Citeriore are∕αcerw, farei (Castrovillari); tute lacollerre, tu te Γacolleresti (Cosenza); l'accettéra, Γaccetterebbe (Grimaldi); and from those of (2) the Abruzzi, vulér’, vorrei (Castelli); dere, darei (Atessa); candére, canterei. For the dialects of the Abruzzi, we can check our observations by examples from the oldest chronicle of Aquila, as non habéra lassato, non avrebbe lasciato (str. 180). There are some interesting remains (more or less corrupted both in form and usage) of ancient consonantal terminations which have not yet been sufficiently studied: s’ incaricaviti, s’ incaricava, -abat (Basilicata, Senise); ebbiti, ebbe (ib.}∙, aviadi, aveva (Calabria, Grimaldi); arrivaudi, arrivb (fb. ). The last example also gives the -an of the 3d pers. sing, perf. of the first conjugation, which still occurs in Sicily and between the horns of the Neapolitan mainland. In the Abruzzi (and in the Ascolan district) the 3d person of the plural is in process of disappearing (the -no having fallen away and the preceding vowel being obscured), and its function is assumed by the 3d person singular; cf. C. L The explanation of the Neapolitan forms songhe, io sono, essi sono, donghe, io do, stonghe, io sto, as also of the enclitic of the 2d person plural which exists, e.g., in the Sicil. avissivu, Neap, avisiere, aveste, has been correctly given more than once. It may be remarked in conclusion that this Neo-Latin region keeps company with the Roumanian in maintaining in large use the -ora derived from the ancient neuter plurals of the type tempora·. Sicil. j6cura, giuochi; Calabr. nidura, Abruzz. nidere, nidi. As for literary documents, if mere fragments and dubious instances are left out of account, Sicilian poetry goes back as far as to the first half of the 13th century, to which century also the chronicles written in Sicilian extend; but either the copies which we possess are not contemporary or the paleographic key of the readings preserved, to us is wanting. In the library of Naples, some MSS. of the 14th century contain poetical translations of which the dialect would seem to belong to the Mediterranean versant of the southern provinces. The old rhymed chronicle of Aquila, which has been referred to more than once above, belongs to the 14th century.

4. Dialects of Umbria, the Marches, and the Province of Rome.— The Ascolan dialect (basin of the Tronto) still depends on the Abruzzan system; and, speaking generally, several conspicuous southern phenomena are widely distributed through the region now under review. Thus the ll≈ld extends from the Abruzzi (Noreia: callu, caldo; Rome: aviscalla, riscalda; the phenomenon, however, occurs also in Corsica); and the assimilation of nd, into nn, and of mb into mm stretches through Umbria, the Marches, and Rome, and even crosses from the Roman province into southern Tuscany (Rieti: quanno, quando; Spoleto: comannava, comandava; Assisi: pia-gnenno, piangendo; Sanseverino Marches: piagnenne, , mmece, invece (imbece); Fabriano: vennecassc, vendicarsi; Osimo: monno, mondo; Rome: fronna, fronda; piommo, piombo; Pitigliano (Tuscany): quanno, piagncnno}. Even the diphthongs of the c and the o in position are largely represented. Examples are—at Norcia: tiempi, uocchi, stuortu; Assisi and Fabriano: tiempo; Orvieto: tiempo, tierra, le tuorte, li torti, and even duonna. The change of l into r, so frequent throughout this region, and particularly characteristic of Rome, is a phenomenon common to the Aquilan dialect. Similar facts might be adduced in abundance. And it is to be noted that the features common to Umbro-Roman and the Neapolitan dialects must have been more numerous in the past, as this was the region where the Tuscan current met the southern, and by reason of its superior culture gradually gained the ascendency.^[39. There is therefore nothing surprising in the fact that, for example, the chronicle of Monaldeschi of Orvieto (14th century) should indicate a form of speech of which Muratori remarks: “Romanis tunc familiaris, nimirum quae in nonnullis accedebat ad Neapolitanam seu vocibus seu pronuntiatione.” The alt into ait, &c. (aitro, rnoito}, which occur in the well known Vita di Cola di Rienzo, also shows Abruzzan affinity.] —The phonological connexions between the Northern Umbrian, the Aretine, and the Gallo-Italic type have already been indicated (B. 2). In what relates to morphology, the -orno of the 3d pers. plur. of the perfect of the first conjugation has been pointed out as an essential peculiarity of the Umbro-Roman territory; but even this it shares with the Aquila vernaculars, which, moreover, extend it to the other paradigms: amôrno, tim6rono, &c. Further, this termination is found also in the Tuscan dialects.—In a large part of Umbria an m or t is prefixed to the sign of the dative: t-a lu, a lui; m-al re, al re;^[40. This second prefix is common to the opposite valley of the Metauro, and appears farther south in the form of me,— Camerino: me lupettu, nel petto, me lu Seppurgru, al Sepolcro.] which must be the remains of the auxiliary prepositions int(us}, a(m)pιιd, cf. Prov. amb, am, (cf. Arch., ii. 444-46).—By means of the series of Perugine texts this group of dialects may be traced back with confidence to the 13th century; and to this region should also belong a “Confession,” half Latin half vernacular, dating from about the 11th century, edited and annotated by Flechia (Arch., vii. 121 sqq.). The “chronicle” of Monaldeschi has been already mentioned. A collection of ancient dialectal texts of Perugia and the neighbouring districts is to be published by Monaci in the Archivio Glottoloqico.

D. Tuscan, and the literary language of the Italians.

We have now only to deal with the Tuscan territory. It is bounded on the W. by the sea. To the north it terminates with the Apennines; for Romagna Toscana, the strip of country on the Adriatic versant which belongs to it administratively, is assigned to Emilia as regards dialect. In the north-west also the Emilian presses on the Tuscan, extending as it does down the Mediterranean slope of the Apennines in Lunigiana and Garfagnana. Intrusions which may be called Emilian have also beeιj noted to the west of the Apennines in the district where the Arno and the Tiber take their rise (Aretine dialects); and it has been seen how thence to the sea the Umbrian and Roman dialects surround the Tuscan. Such are the narrow limits of the “promised land” of the language which has succeeded and was worthy to succeed Latin in the history of Italian culture and civilization,—the land which comprises Florence, Siena, Lucca, and Pisa.—The Tuscan type may be best described by the negative method. There do not exist in it, on the one hand, any of those phenomena by which the other dialectal types of Italy mainly differ from the Latin base (such as ü = ⅞; frequent elision of unaccented vowels; ba=gua-, $=fl; nn = nd, &c.); nor, on the other hand, is there any series of alterations of the Latin base peculiar to the Tuscan. This twofold negative description may further serve for the Tuscan or literary Italian as contrasted with all the other Neo-Latin languages; indeed, even -where the Tuscan has a tendency to alterations common to other types of the family, it shows itself more sober and self-denying,—as may be seen in the reduction of the t between vowels into d or of c (ff) between vowels into g, which in Italian affects only a small part of the lexical series, while in Provençal or Spanish it may be said to pervade the whole (e.g., Prov. and Span, mudar, Ital. mutare ; Prov. segur, Span, seguro, Ital. sicurd). It may consequently be affirmed without any partiality that, in respect to historical nobility, the Italian not only holds the first rank among Neo-Latin languages, but almost constitutes an intermediate grade between the ancient or Latin and the modern or Romance.—What has just been said about the Tuscan, as compared with the other dialectal types of Italy, does not, however, preclude the fact that in the various Tuscan veins, and especially in the plebeian forms of speech, there occur particular instances of phonetic decay; but these must of necessity be ignored in [9:13:497] so brief a sketch as the present. We shall confine ourselves to noting—what has a wide territorial diffusion— the reduction of c (f) between vowels to a mere breathing (p.g., fuoho, fuoco, but porco), or even its complete elision; the same phenomenon occurs also between word and word (e.<∕., la hasa, but in casa), thus illustrating anew that syntactic class of phonetic alterations, either qualitative or quantitative, conspicuous in this region also, which has been already discussed for insular and southern Italy (B. 2; C. 2, 3), and could be exemplified for the Roman region as well (C. 4). As regards one or two individual phenomena, it must also be confessed that the Tuscan or literary Italian is not so well preserved as some other Neo-Latin tongues. Thus, French always keeps in the beginning of words the Latin formulae cl, pl, fl (clef, plaisir, flcur, in contrast with the Italian chiave, p>iacere, flore)', but the Italian makes up for this by the greater vigour with which it is wont to resolve the same formula within the words, and by the greater symmetry thus produced between the two series (in opposition to the Frencjι clef, clave, we have, for example, the French ceil, oclo; whereas, in the Italian, chiave and occhio correspond to each other). The Italian as well as the Roumanian has lost the ancient sibilant at the end (-s of the plurals, of the nominative singular, of the 2d persons, &c.) which throughout the rest of the Romance area has been preserved more or less tenaciously; and consequently it stands lower than old Provençal and old French, as far as true declension or, more precisely, the functional distinction between the forms of the casus rectus and the casus obliquus is concerned. But even in this respect the superiority of French and Provençal has proved merely transitory, and in their modern condition all the Neo-Latin forms of speech are generally surpassed by Italian even as regards the pure grammatical consistency of the noun. In conjugation Tuscan has lost that tense which for the sake of brevity we shall continue to call the pluperfect indicative; though it still survives outside of Italy and in other dialectal types of Italy itself (C. 3 b; cf. B. 2). It has also lost the futurum exactum, or perfect subjunctive, which is found in Spanish and Roumanian. But no one would on that account maintain that the Italian conjugation is less truly Latin than the Spanish, the Roumanian, or that of any other Neo-Latin language. It is, on the contrary, by far the most distinctively Latin as regards the tradition both of form and function, although many effects of the principle of analogy are to be observed, sometimes common to Italian with the other Neo-Latin languages, and sometimes peculiar to itself.

Those who find it hard to believe in the ethnological explanation of linguistic varieties ought to be convinced by any example so clear as that which Italy presents in the difference between the Tuscan or purely Italian type on the one side and the Gallo-Italic on the other. The names in this instance correspond exactly to the facts of the case. For the Gallo-Italic on either side of the Alps is evidently nothing else than a modification—varying in degree, but always very great — of the vulgar Latin, due to the reaction of the language or rather the oral tendencies of the Celts who succumbed to the Roman civilization. In other words, the case is one of new ethnic individualities arising from the fusion of two national entities, one of which, numerically more or less weak, is so far victorious that its speech is adopted, while the other succeeds in adapting that speech to its own habits of utterance. Genuine Italian, on the other hand, is not the result of the combination or conflict of the vulgar Latin with other tongues, but is the pure development of this alone. In other words, the case is that of an ancient national fusion in which vulgar Latin itself originated. Here that is native which in the other case was intrusive.—This greater purity of constitution gives the language a persistency which approaches permanent stability. There is no Old Italian to oppose to Modern Italian in the same sense as we have an Old French to oppose to a Modern French. It is true that in the old French writers, and even in the writers who used the dialects of Upper Italy, there was a tendency to bring back the popular forms to their ancient dignity; and it is true also that the Tuscan or literary Italian has suffered from the changes of centuries; but nevertheless it remains undoubted that in the former cases we have to deal with general transformations between old and new, while in the latter it is evident that the language of Dante continues to be the Italian of modern speech and literature. This character of invariability has thus been in direct proportion to the purity of its Latin origin, while, on the contrary, w'here popular Latin has been adopted by peoples of foreign speech, the elaboration which it has undergone along the lines of their oral tendencies becomes always the greater the farther we get away from the point at which the Latin reached them,—in proportion, that is, to the time and space through which it has been transmitted in these foreign mouths.^[41. A complete analogy is afforded by the history of the Aryan or Sanskrit language in India, which in space and time shows always more and more strongly the reaction of the oral tendencies of the aboriginal races on whom it has been imposed. Thus the Pali presents the ancient Aryan organism in a condition analogous to that of the oldest French, and the Prakrit of the Dramas, on the other hand, in a condition like that of modem French.]

As for the primitive seat of the literary language of Italy, not only must it be regarded as confined within the limits of that narrower Tuscany already described; strictly speaking, it must be identified with the city of Florence alone. Leaving out of account, therefore, a small number of words borrowed from other Italian dialects, as a certain number have naturally been borrowed from foreign tongues, it may be said that all that was not Tuscan was eliminated from the literary form of speech. If we go back to the time of Dante we find, throughout almost all the dialects of the mainland with the exception of Tuscan, the change of vowels between singular and plural seen in paese, ρaisi; quello, quilli; amore, amuri (see B. 1; C. 3 b) ; but the literary language knows nothing at all of such a phenomenon, because it was unknown to the Tuscan region. But in Tuscan itself there were differences between Florentine and non-Florentine; in Florentine, e.g., it was and is usual to say dipignere and ρugnere, while the nonFlorentine had it dipegnere and pognere (Lat pingere, pungere). Now, it is precisely the Florentine forms which alone have currency in the literary language.

In the ancient compositions in the vulgar tongue, especially in poetry, non-Tuscan authors on the one hand accommodated their own dialect to the analogy of that which they felt to be the purest representative of the language of ancient Roman culture, while the Tuscan authors in their turn did not refuse to adopt the forms which had received the rights of citizenship from the literary celebrities of other parts of Italy. It was this state of matters which gave rise, in past times, to the numerous disputes about the true fatherland and origin of the literary language of the Italians. But these have been deprived of all right to exist by the scientific investigation of the history of that language. If the older Italian poetry assumed or maintained forms alien to Tuscan speech, these forms were after, wards gradually eliminated, and the field was left to those which were purely Tuscan and indeed purely Florentine. And thus it remains absolutely true that, so far as phonetics, morphology, rudimental syntax, and in short the whole character and material of words and sentences are concerned, there is no literary language of Europe that is more [9:13:498] thoroughly characterized by homogeneity and oneness, as if it had come forth in a single cast from the furnace, than the Italian.

But on the other hand it remains equally true that, so far as concerns a living confidence and uniformity in the use and style of the literary language—that is, of this Tuscan or Florentine material called to nourish the civilization and culture of all the Italians—the case is not a little altered, and the Italian nation appears to enjoy less fortunate conditions than other nations of Europe. Modern Italy had no glowing centre for the life of the whole nation into which and out of which the collective thought and language could be poured in ceaseless current for all and by all. Florence has not been Paris. Territorial contiguity and the little difference of the local dialect facilitated in the modern Rome the elevation of the language of conversation to a level with the literary language that came from Tuscany. A form of speech was thus produced which, though certainly destitute of the grace and the abundant flexibility of the Florentine, gives a good idea of what the dialect of a city becomes when it makes itself the language of a nation that is ripening its civilization in many and dissimilar centres. In such a case the dialect loses its slang and petty localisms, and at the same time also somewhat of its freshness; but it learns to express with more conscious sobriety and with more assured dignity the thought and the feeling of the various peoples which are fused in one national life. But what took place readily in Rome could not with equal ease happen in districts whose dialects were far removed from the Tuscan. In Piedmont, for example, or in Lombardy, the language of conversation did not correspond with the language of books, and the latter accordingly became artificial and laboured. Poetry was least affected by these unfortunate conditions ; for poetry may work well with a multiform language, where the need and the stimulus of the author’s individuality assert themselves more strongly. But prose suffered immensely, and the Italians had good cause to envy the spontaneity and confidence of foreign literatures—of the French more particularly. In this reasonable envy lay the justification and the strength of the Manzoni school, which aimed at that absolute naturalness of the literary language, that absolute identity between the language of conversation and that of books, which the bulk of the Italians could reach and maintain only by naturalizing themselves in the living speech of modern Florence. The revolt of Manzoni against artificiality and mannerism in language and st} le was worthy of his genius, and has been largely fruitful. But the historical difference between the case of France (with the colloquial language of Paris) and that of Italy (with the colloquial language of Florence) implies more than one difficulty of principle; in the latter case there is sought to be produced by deliberate effort of the literati what in the former has been and remains the necessary and spontaneous product of the entire civilization. Manzoni’s theories too easily lent themselves to deplorable exaggerations; men fell into a new artificiality, a manner of writing which might be called vulgar and almost slangy. The remedy for this must lie in the regulating power of the labour of the now regenerate Italian intellect,—a labour ever growing wider in its scope, more assiduous, and more thoroughly united.

Literature. — Fernow in the third volume of his Römische Studien (Zurich, 1806-8) gave a good survey of the dialects of Italy. The dawn of rigorously scientific methods had not then appeared; but Fernow’s view is wide and genial. Similar praise is due to Biondelli ’ s work Sai dialetti gallo-italici (Milan, 1853), which, however, is still ignorant of Diez. Fuchs, between Fernow and Biondelli, had made himself so far acquainted with the new methods; but his exploration (fibber die sogenannten unregelmässigen Zeitwörter in den Romanischen Sprachen, nebst Andeutungen über die wichtigsten romanischen Mundarten, Berlin, 1840), though certainly of utility, was not very successful. Nor can the rapid survey of the Italian dialects given by Diez be ranked among the happiest portions of his great masterpiece. Among the followers of Diez who distinguished themselves in this department the first outside of Italy were certainly Mussafia, a cautious and clear continuator of the master, and the singularly acute Schuchardt. Next came the Archivio glottologico italiano (Rome, from 1873).—In historical study applied specially to the literary language Nannucci prepared the way with much sagacity and breadth of view; it is enough to mention his Analisi critica dei verbi italiani (Flor., 1844). Among the works of the disciples of the modern method may here be noted Canello, “Gli allotropi italiani” (Arch., iii. 285-419) and Caix, Originidella lingua poetica italiana (Florence, 1880), which resolves itself into an accurate historical examination of the dialectal forms that occur in the old poetry.—For almost a quarter of a century a matchless investigator, Giovanni Flechia, has devoted assiduous, keen, and genial labour to the history and description both of the dialects and of the literary language (see Arch., ii. 396, iii. 176).—Biondelli’s book is of no small service also for the numerous translations which it contains of the Prodigal Son into Lombard, Piedmontese, and Emilian dialects. A dialogue translated into the vernaculars of all parts of Italy will be found in Zuccagni Orlandini’s Raccolta di dialetti italiani con illustrazioni etnologiche (Florence, 1864). And every dialectal division is abundantly represented in a series of versions of a short novel of Boccaccio’s, which Papanti has published under the title I pariari italiani in Ccrtaldo, &c. (Leghorn, 1875). (G. I. A.)

PART IV.—LITERATURE.

1. Origins.— There is one characteristic fact that distinguishes the Italy of the Middle Ages with regard to its intellectual conditions, and that is the tenacity with which the Latin tradition clung to life. At the end of the 5th century the northern conquerors invaded Italy. The Roman world crumbled to pieces. A new kingdom arose at Ravenna under Theodoric, and there learning was not extinguished. The liberal arts flourished, the very Gothic kings surrounded themselves with masters of rhetoric and of grammar. The names of Cassiodorus, of Boetius, of Symmachus, are enough to show how Latin thought maintained its power amidst the political effacement of the Roman empire. And this thought held its ground throughout the subsequent ages and events. Thus, while elsewhere all culture had died out, there still remained in Italy some schools of laymen,^[42. τ See Giesebrecht, De Litterarum Studiis apud Italos primis Medii Aevi Saeculis, Berlin, 1845.] and some really extraordinary men were educated in them, such as Ennodiπs, a poet more pagan than Christian, Arator, Fortunatus, Venantιus, Jovannicius, Felix the grammarian, Peter of Pisa, Paulinus of Aquileia, and many others, in all of whom we notice a contrast between the barbarous age they lived in and their aspiration towards a culture that should reunite them to the classical literature of Rome. The Italians never had much love for theological studies, and those who were addicted to them preferred Paris to Italy. It was something more practical, more positive, that had attraction for the Italians, and especially the study of Roman law. This zeal for the study of jurisprudence furthered the establishment of the mediaeval universities of Bologna, Padua, Vicenza, Naples, Salerno, Modena, and Parma; and these, in their turn, helped to spread culture, and to prepare the ground in which the new vernacular literature was afterwards to be developed. The tenacity of classical traditions, the affection for the memories of Rome, the preoccupation with political interests, particularly shown in the wars of the Lombard communes against the empire of thr Hohenstaufens, a spirit more naturally inclined to practice [9:13:499] than to theory—all this had a powerful influence on the fate of Italian literature. Italy was wanting in that combination of conditions from which the spontaneous life of a people springs. This was chiefly owing to the fact that the history of the Italians never underwent interruption,— no foreign nation having come in to change them and make them young again. That childlike state of mind and heart, which in other Latin races, as well as in the Germanic, was such a deep source of poetic inspiration, was almost utterly wanting in the Italians, who were always much drawn to history and very little to nature; so, while legends, tales, epic poems, satires, were appearing and spreading on all sides, Italy was either quite a stranger to this movement, of took a peculiar part in it. We know, for example, what the Trojan traditions were in the Middle Ages; and we should have thought that in Italy—in the country of Rome, retaining the memory of Aeneas and Virgil—they would have been specially developed, for it was from Virgil that the mediaeval sympathy for the conquered of Troy was derived. In fact, however, it was not so. A strange book made its appearance in Europe, no one quite knows when, the Historia de excidio Trojae, which purported to have been written by a certain Dares the Phrygian, an eye-witness of the Trojan war. In the Middle Ages this book was the basis of many literary labours. Benoit de Sainte-More composed an interminable French poem founded on it, which afterwards in its turn became a source for other poets to draw from, such as Herbort of Fritzlar and Conrad of Würzburg. Now for the curious phenomenon displayed by Italy. Whilst Benoit de Sainte-More wrote his poem in French, taking his material from a Latin history, whilst the two German writers, from a French source, made an almost original work in their own language,—an Italian, on the other hand, taking Benoit for his model, composed in Latin the Historia destructionis Trojae ; and this Italian was Guido delie Colonne of Messina, one of the vernacular poets of the Sicilian school, who must accordingly have known well how to use his own language. Guido was an imitator of the Provençals; he understood French, and yet wrote his own book in Latin, nay, changed the romance of the Troubadour into serious history. Much the same thing occurred with the other great legends. That of Alexander the Great gave rise to many French, German, and Spanish poems,—in Italy, only to the Latin distichs of Qualichino of Arezzo. The whole of Europe was full of the legend of Arthur. The Italians contented themselves with translating and with abridging the French romances, without adding anything of their own. The Italian writer could neither appropriate the legend nor colour it with his own tints. Even religious legend, so widely spread in the Middle Ages, and springing up so naturally as it did from the heart of that society, only put out a few roots in Italy. Jacopo di Voragine, white collecting his lives of the saints, remained only an historian, a man of learning, almost a critic who seemed doubtful about the things he related. Italy had none of those books in which the Middle Age, whether in its ascetic or its chivalrous character, is so strangely depicted. The intellectual life of Italy showed itself in an altogether special, positive, almost scientific form, in the study of Roman law, in the chronicles of Farfa, of Marsicano, and of many others, in translations from Aristotle, in the precepts of the school of Salerno, in the travels of Marco Polo,—in short, in a long series of facts which seem to detach themselves from the surroundings of the Middle Age, and to be united on the one side with classical Rome and on the other with the Renaissance.

The necessary consequence of all this was that the Latin language was most tenacious in Italy, and that the elaboration of the new vulgar tongue was very slow,—being in fact preceded by two periods of Italian literature in foreign languages. That is to say, there were many Italians who wrote Provençal poems, such as the Marchese Alberto Malaspina (12th century), Maestro Ferrari of Ferrara, Cigala of Genoa,· Zorzi of Venice, Sordello of Mantua, Buvarello of Bologna, Nicoletto of Turin, and others, who sang of love and of war, who haunted the courts, or lived in the midst of the people, accustoming them to new sounds and new harmonies. At the same time there was other poetry of an epic kind, written in a mixed language, of which French was the basis, but in which forms and words belonging to the Italian dialects were continually mingling. We find in it hybrid words exhibiting a treatment of sounds according to the rules of both languages,—French words with Italian terminations, a system of vocalization within the words approaching the Italo-Latin usage,—in short, something belonging at once to both tongues, as it were an attempt at interpenetration, at fusion. Such were the Chanson de Geste, Macaire, the Entree en Espagne written by Niccola of Padua, the Prise de Pampeluηe, and some others. All this preceded the appearance of a purely Italian literature.

In the Franco-Italian poems there was, as it were, a clashing, a struggle between the two languages, the French, however, gaining the upper hand. This supremacy became gradually less and less. As the struggle continued between French and Italian, the former by degrees lost as much as the latter gained. ' The hybridism recurred, but it no longer predominated. In the Bovo TAntona and the Rainardo e Leseηgriηo the Venetian dialect makes itself clearly felt, although the language is influenced by French forms. Thus these writings, which Ascoli has called “miste” (mixed), immediately preceded the appearance of purely Italian works.

It is now an established historical fact that there existed no writing in Italian before the 13th century. It was in: the course of that century, and especially from 1250 ’ onwards, that the new literature largely unfolded and developed itself. This development was simultaneous in the whole peninsula, only there was a difference in the subject-matter of the art. In the north, the poems of Giacominoof Verona and Bonvecino of Riva were specially religious, and were intended to be recited to the people. They were written in a dialect partaking of the Milanese and the Venetian; and in their style they strongly bore the mark of the influence of French narrative poetry. They may be considered as belonging to the popular kind of poetry, taking the word, however, in a broad sense. Perhaps this sort of composition was encouraged by the old custom in the north of Italy of listening in the piazzas and on the highways to the songs of the jongleurs. To the very same crowds who had been delighted with the stories of romance, and who had listened to the story of the wickedness of Macaire and the misfortunes of Blanciflor, another jongleur would sing of the terrors of the Babiloniα Infernale and the blessedness of the Gerιιsalemme celeste, and the singers of religious poetry vied' with those of the Chansons de Geste.

In the south of Italy, on the other hand, the love-song prevailed, of which we have an interesting specimen in the Contrasta attributed to Ciullo d’Alcamo, about which modern Italian critics have much exercised themselves. This “contraste” (dispute) between a man and a woman in Sicilian dialect certainly must not be considered as the most ancient or as the only southern poem of a popular kind. It belongs without doubt to the time of the emperor Frederick II., and is important as a proof that there existed a popular poetry independent of literary poetry. The Contrasta of Ciullo d’Alcamo is the most remarkable relic of a kind -of poetry that has perished or which perhaps [9:13:500] was smothered by the ancient Sicilian literature. Its distinguishing point was its possessing all the opposite qualities to the poetry of the rhymers of what we shall call the Sicilian school. Vigorous in the expression of feelings, it seems to come fro<n a real sentiment. The conceits, which are sometimes most bold and very coarse, show that it proceeded from the lowest grades of society. Everything is original in Ciullo’s Contrasto. Conventionality has no place in it. It is marked by the sensuality characteristic of the people of the South.

The reverse of all this happened in the Siculo-Provençal school, at the head of which was Frederick II. Imitation was the fundamental characteristic of this school, to which belonged Enzio, king of Sardinia, Pier delle Vigne, Inghilfredi, Guido and Odo delle Colonne, Jacopo d’Aquino, Rugieri Pugliese, Giacomo da Lentino, Arrigo Testa, and others. These rhymers never moved a step beyond the ideas of chivalry; they had no originality; they did not sing of what they felt in their heart; they abhorred the true and the real. They only aimed at copying as closely as they could the poetry of the Provençal troubadours.^[43. See Gaspary, Die Siciliαηische Dichterschule des 13ten Jahrhunderts, Berlin, 1878.] The art of the Siculo-Provençal school was born decrepit, and there were many reasons for this,—first, because the chivalrous spirit, from which the poetry of the troubadours was derived, was now old and on its deathbed; next, because the Provençal art itself, which the Sicilians took as their model, was in its decadence. It may seem strange, but it is true, that when the emperor Frederick II., a philosopher, a statesman, a very original legislator, took to writing poetry, he could only copy and amuse himself with absolute puerilities. His art, like that of all the other poets of his court, was wholly conventional, mechanical, affected. It was completely wanting in what constitutes poetry,—ideality, feeling, sentiment, inspiration. The Italians have had great disputes among themselves about the original form of the poems of the Sicilian school, that is to say, whether they were written in Sicilian dialect, or in that language which Dante called “volgare, illustre, aulico, cortigiano”; and the question is not yet settled. But now the critics of most authority hold that the primitive form of these poems was the Sicilian dialect, modified for literary purposes with the help of Provençal and Latin; the theory of the “lingua illustre” has been almost entirely rejected, since we cannot say on what rules it could have been founded, when literature was in its infancy, trying its feet, and lisping its first words. The Sicilian certainly, in accordance with, a tendency common to all dialects, in passing from the spoken to the written form, must have gained in dignity; but this was not enough to create the so-called “lingua illustre,” which was upheld by Perticari and others on grounds rather political than literary.

In the 13th century a mighty religious movement took place in Italy, of which the rise of the two great orders of Saint Francis and Saint Dominic was at once the cause and the effect. Around Francis of Assisi a legend has grown up in which naturally the imaginative element prevails. Yet from some points in it we seem to be able to infer that its hero had a strong feeling for nature, and a heart open to the most lively impressions. Many poems are attributed to him. The legend relates that in the eighteenth year of his penance, when almost rapt in ecstasy, he dictated the Cantico del Sole. Even if this hymn be really his, it cannot be considered as a poetical work, being written in a kind of prose simply marked by assonances. As for the other poems, which for a long time were believed to be by Saint Francis, their spuriousness is now generally recognized. The true poet who represented in all its strength and breadth the religious feeling that had made special progress in Umbria was Jacopo dei Benedetti of Todi, known as Jacopone. The story is that sorrow at the sudden death of his wife had disordered his mind, and that, having sold all he possessed and given it to the poor, he covered himself with rags, and took pleasure in being laughed at, and followed by a crowd of people who mocked him and called after him “Jacopone, Jacopone.” We do not know whether this be true. What we do know is that a vehement passion must have stirred his heart and maintained a despotic hold over him, the passion of divine love. Under its influence Jacopone went on raving for years and years, subjecting himself to the severest sufferings, and giving vent to his religious intoxication in his poems. There is no art in him, there is not the slightest indication of deliberate effort; there is only feeling, a feeling that absorbed him, fascinated him, penetrated him through and through. His poetry was all inside him, and burst out, not so much in words as in sighs, in groans, in cries that often seem really to come from a monomaniac. But Jacopone was a mystic, who from his hermit’s cell looked out into the world and specially watched the papacy, scourging with his words Celestine V. and Boniface VIII. He was put in prison and laden with chains, but his spirit lifted itself up to God, and that was enough for him. The same feeling that prompted him to pour out in song ecstasies of divine love, and to despise and trample on himself, moved him to reprove those who forsook the heavenly road, whether they were popes, prelates, or monks. In Jacopone there was a strong originality, and in the period of the origins of Italian literature he was one of the most characteristic writers.

The religious movement in Umbria was followed by another literary phenomenon, that of the religious drama. In 1258 an old hermit, Raniero Fasani, leaving the cavern in which he had lived for many years, suddenly appeared at Perugia. These were very sad times for Italy. The quarrels in the cities, the factions of the Ghibellines and the Guelphs, the interdicts and excommunications issued by the popes, the reprisals of the imperial party, the cruelty and tyranny of the nobles, the plagues and famines, kept the people in constant agitation, and spread abroad mysterious fears. The commotion was increased in Perugia by Fasani, who represented himself as sent by God to disclose mysterious visions, and to announce to the world terrible visitations. Under the influence of fear there were formed “Compagnie di Disciplinant!,” who, for a penance, scourged themselves till they drew blood, and sang “Laudi” in dialogue in their confraternities. These “Laudi,” closely connected with the liturgy, were the first example of the drama in the vulgar tongue of Italy. They were written in the Umbrian dialect, in verses of eight syllables, and of course they have not any artistic value. Their development, however, was rapid. As early as the end of the same 13th century we have the Devozioηi del Giovedï e Venerdl Santo, which have some dramatic elements in them, though they are still connected with the liturgical office. Then we have the representation di un Monaco ehe ando al servizio di Dio (“of a monk who entered the service of God”), in which there is already an approach to the definite form which this kind of literary work assumed in the following centuries.

In the 13th century Tuscany was peculiarly circumstanced both as regards its literary condition and its political life. The Tuscans spoke a dialect which most closely resembled the mother-tongue, Latin,—one which afterwards became almost exclusively the language of literature, and which was already regarded at the end of the 13 th century as surpassing the others; “Lingua Tusca magis apta est [9:13:501] ad literam sive literaturam”: thus writes Antonio da Tempo of Padua, born about 1275. Being very little or not at all affected by the Germanic invasion, Tuscany was never subjected to the feudal system. It had fierce internal struggles, but they did not weaken its life; on the contrary, they rather gave it fresh vigour and strengthened it, and (especially after the final fall of the Hohenstaufens at the battle of Benevento in 1266) made it the first province of Italy. From 1266 onwards Florence was in a position to begin that movement of political reform which in 1282 resulted in the appointment of the Priori delle Arti, and the establishment of the Arti Minori. This was afterwards copied by Siena with the Magistrato dei Nove, by Lucca, by Pistoia, and by other Guelph cities in Tuscany with similar popular institutions. In this way the guilds had taken the government into their hands, and it was a time of both social and political prosperity. It was no wonder that literature also rose to an unlooked-for height. In Tuscany, too, there was some popular love poetry; there was a school of imitators of the Sicilians, their chief being Dante of Majano; but its literary originality took another line—that of humorous and satirical poetry. The entirely democratic form of government created a style of poetry which stood in the strongest antithesis to the mediaeval mystic and chivalrous style. Devout invocation of God or of a lady came from the cloister and the castle; in the streets of the cities everything that had gone before was treated with ridicule or biting sarcasm. Folgore of San Gimignano laughs when in his sonnets he tells a party of Sienese youths what are the occupations of every month in the year, or when he teaches a party of Florentine lads the pleasures of every day in the week. Cene della Chitarra laughs when he parodies Folgore’s sonnets. The sonnets of Rustico di Filippo are half fun and half satire; laughing and crying, joking and satire, are all to be found in Cecco Angiolieri of Siena, the oldest “humorist" we know, a far-off precursor of Rabelais, of Montaigne, of Jean Paul Richter, of Sydney Smith. But another kind of poetry also began in Tuscany. Guittone d’Arezzo made art quit chivalrous for national motives, Provençal forms for Latin. He attempted political poetry, and, although his work is full of the strangest obscurities, he prepared the way for the Bolognese school. In the 13th century Bologna was the city of science, and philosophical poetry appeared there. Guido Guinicelli was the poet after the new fashion of the art. In him the ideas of chivalry are changed and enlarged; he sings of love and together with it of the nobility of the mind. The reigning thought in Guinicelli’s Canzoni is nothing external to his own subjectivity. His speculative mind, accustomed to wandering in the field of philosophy, transfuses its lucubrations into his art. Guinicelli’s poetry has some of the faults of the school of Guittone d’Arezzo: he reasons too much; he is wanting in imagination; his poetry is a product of the intellect rather than of the fancy and the heart. Nevertheless he marks a great development in the history of Italian art, especially because of his close connexion with Dante’s lyric poetry.

But before we come to Dante, certain other facts, not, however, unconnected with his history, must be noticed. In the 13th century there were several poems in the allegorical style. One of these is by Brunetto Latini, who, it is well known, was attached by ties of strong affection to Alighieri. His Tesoretto is a short poem, in sevensyllable verses, rhyming in couplets, in which the author professes to be lost in a wilderness and to meet with a lady, who is Nature, from whom he receives much instruction. λV e see here the vision, the allegory, the instruction with a moral object,—three elements which we shall find again in the Divina Commedia. Francesco da Barberiuo, a learned lawyer who was secretary to bishops, a judge, a notary, wrote two little allegorical poems,—the Documenti T Amore and Del Reggimeηto e dei Costumi delle Donne. Like the Tesoretto, these poems are of no value as works of art, but are, on the other hand, of importance in the history of manners. A fourth allegorical work was the Intelligenza, by some attributed to Dino Compagni, but probably not his, and only a version of French poems.

While the production of Italian poetry in the 13th century was abundant and varied, that of prose was scanty. The oldest specimen dates from 1231, and consists of short notices of entries and expenses by Mattasalà di Spinello dei Lambertini of Siena. In 1253 and 1260 there are some commercial letters of other Sienese. But there is no sign of literary prose. Before we come to any, we meet with a phenomenon like that we noticed in regard to poetry. Here again we find a period of Italian literature in-French. Halfway on in the century a certain Aldobrando or Aldobrandino (it is not known whether he was of Florence or of Siena) wrote a book for Beatrice of Savoy, countess of Provence, called Le Regime du Corps. In 1267 Martino da Canale wrote in the same “langue d , oιl"a chronicle of Venice. Rusticiano of Pisa, who was for a long while at the court of Edward I. of England, composed many chivalrous romances, derived from the Arthurian cycle, and subsequently wrote the travels of Marco Polo, which may perhaps have been dictated by the great traveller himself. And finally Brunetto Latini wrote his Tesoro in French.

Next in order to the original compositions in the langue d’oïl come the translations or adaptations from the same. There are some moral narratives taken from religious legends; a romance of Julius Caesar; some short histories of ancient knights; the Tavola Rotonda ; translations of the Viaggi of Marco Polo and of the Tesoro of Latini. At the same time there appeared translations from Latin of moral and ascetic works, of histories, and of treatises on rhetoric and oratory. Up to very recent times it was still possible to reckon as the most ancient works in Italian prose the Cronaca of Matteo Spinello da Giovenazzo, and the Cronaca of Ricordano Malespini. But now both of them have been shown to be forgeries of a much later time. Therefore the oldest prose writing is a scientific book —the Composizione del Mondo by Ristoro d’Arezzo, who lived about the middle of the 13th century. This work is a copious treatise on astronomy and geography. Ristoro was superior to the other writers of the time on these subjects, because he seems to have been a careful observer of natural phenomena, and consequently many of the things he relates were the result of his personal investigations. There is also another short treatise, De Regimine Rectoris, by Fra Paolino, a Minorite friar of Venice, who was probably bishop of Pozzuoli, and who also wrote a Latin chronicle. His treatise stands in close relation to that of Egidio Colonna, De Regimine Priηcipum. It is written in the Venetian dialect.

The 13th century was very rich in tales. There is a collection called the Cento Novelle Aniiche which contains stories drawn from Oriental, Greek, and Trojan traditions, from ancient and mediaeval history, from the legends of Brittany, Provence, and Italy, and from the Bible, from the local tradition of Italy as well as from histories of animals and old mythology. This book has a distant resemblance to the Spanish collection known as El Conde Lucanor. The peculiarity of the Italian book is that the stories are very short, and that they seem to be mere outlines to be filled in by the narrator as he goes along. Other prose novels were inserted by Francesco Barberino in his work Del Reggimento e dei Costumi delle Donne, but they are of much less importance than the others. On the whole the Italian novels of the 13th century have little originality, and are only a faint reflexion of the very rich [9:13:502] legendary literature of France. Some attention should be paid to the Lettere of Fra Guittone d’Arezzo, who wrote many poems and also some letters in prose, the subjects of which are moral and religious. Love of antiquity, of the traditions of Rome and of its language, was so strong in Guittone that he tried to write Italian in a Latin style, and it turned out obscure, involved, and altogether barbarous. He took as his special model Seneca, and hence his prose assumed a bombastic style, which, according to his views, was very artistic, but which in fact was alien to the true spirit of art, and resulted in the extravagant and grotesque.

2. The Spontaneous Development of Italian Literature.— In the year 1282, the year in which the new Florentine constitution of the “Arti Minori” was completed, a period of literature began that does not belong to the age of first beginnings, but to that of development. With the school of Lapo Gianni, of Guido Cavalcanti, of Cino da Pistoia, and Dante Alighieri, lyric poetry became exclusively Tuscan. The whole novelty and poetic power of this school, which really was the beginning of Italian art, consist in what Dante expresses so happily—

‘ ‘ Quando

Amore spira, noto, ed a cjuel modo Ch’ei detta dentro, vo significando—”

that is to say, in a power of expressing the feelings of the soul in the way in which love inspires them, in an appropriate and graceful manner, fitting form to matter, and by art fusing one with the other. The Tuscan lyric poetry, the first true Italian art, is pre-eminent in this artistic fusion, in the spontaneous and at the same time deliberate action of the mind. In Lapo Gianni the new style is not free from some admixture of the old associations of the Siculo-Provenςal school. He wavered as it were between two manners. The empty and involved phraseology of the Sicilians is absent, but the poet does not always rid himself of their influence. Sometimes, however, he draws freely from his own heart, and then the subtleties and obscurities disappear, and his verse becomes clear, flowing, and elegant.

Guido Cavalcanti was a learned man with a high conception of his art. He felt the value of it, and adapted his learning to it. Cavalcanti was already a good deal out of sympathy with the mediaeval spirit; he reflected deeply on his own work, and from this reflexion he derived his poetical conception. His poems may be divided into two classes,—those which portray the philosopher, “il sottilis-simo dialettico,” as Lorenzo the Magnificent called him, and those which are more directly the product of his poetic nature imbued with mysticism and metaphysics. To the first set belongs the famous poem Sulla Natura <T Amore, which in fact is a treatise on amorous metaphysics, and was annotated later in a learned way by the most renowned Platonic philosophers of the loth century, such as Marsilius Ficinus and others. In other poems of Cavalcanti’s besides this, we see a tendency to subtilize and to stifle the poetic-imagery under a dead weight of philosophy. But there are many of his sonnets in which the truth of the images and the elegance and simplicity of the style are admirable, and make us feel that we are in quite a new period of art. This is particularly felt in Cavalcanti’s Ballate, for in them he pours himself out ingenuously and without affectation, but with an invariable and profound consciousness of his art. Far above all the others for the reality of the sorrow and the love displayed, for the melancholy longing expressed for the distant home, for the calm and solemn yearning of his heart for the lady of his love, for a deep subjectivity which is never troubled by metaphysical subtleties, is the ballata composed by Cavalcanti when he was banished from Florence with the party of the Bianchi in 1300, and took refuge at Sarzana.

The third poet among the followers of the new school was Cino da Pistoia, of the family of the Sinibuldi (see Cino da Pistoia). His love poems are so sweet, so mellow, and so musical that they are only surpassed by Dante. The pains of love are described by him with vigorous touches; it is easy to see that they are not feigned but real. The psychology of love and of sorrow nearly reaches perfection.

As the author of the Vita Nuova, Dante also belongs to the same lyric school. This is a little book of poetry and prose, which tells the story of his love for Beatrice, who is pretty generally held to be the daughter of Folco Portinari. In the lyrics of the Vita Huova (so called by its author to indicate that his first meeting with Beatrice was the beginning for him of a life entirely different from that he had hitherto led) there is a high idealization of love. It seems as if there were in it nothing earthly or human, and that the poet had his eyes constantly fixed on heaven, while singing of his lady. Everything is supersensual, aerial, heavenly, and the real Beatrice is always gradually melting more and more into the symbolical one—passingout of her human nature and into the divine. The life of Dante covered a period of fifty-six years (1265-1321). In 1289 he fought at Campaldino against the Ghibellines of Arezzo. In 1300 he was probably one of the ambassadors from the Guelphs to Pope Boniface VIII. He was afterwards elected a prior, and it is believed that he took part in the measure for banishing the heads of the factions of the Bianchi and Neri which began that same year in Florence. The Neri betook themselves to Boniface, accusing their adversaries of an understanding with the Ghibellines. For the purpose of meeting these accusations, Dante went to Boniface, but in the meanwhile the latter sent Charles of Valois as a peacemaker, with secret injunctions to crush the Bianchi. Charles fulfilled this part of his mission with zeal. One of the proscribed was Dante, on the charge of illicit gains and of extortion during his priorate. Henceforth the poet’s life was a perpetual pilgrimage from one Italian town to another. He was also at Paris in 130'3. He hoped great things from the descent of Henry VII. of Luxembourg into Italy, and wrote to the people and princes to announce the coming of the day of redemption. He had hopes, too, of Uguccione della Faggiuola, leader of the Pisans against Florence (1315). But all his hopes proved vain, and he took refuge with Can Grande della Scala at Verona (1316), moving on later to Busone di Raffaelli at Gubbio (1318), to Vagano della Torre at Udine (1319), and to Guido Novello da Polenta at Ravenna (1320), where he died the next year.

It appears that Dante began the Convito in his youth, that he continued it in his exile, and never completed it. He named the book the Convito, to signify that a banquet of wisdom was served up in it. He meant to comment on fourteen of his songs, and the commentary was to be the promised serving up of the banquet. But he only composed four out of the fourteen treatises. As has been said by one of Dante’s chief admirers in modern Italy, “it is a book of much learning, but the symbolism kills the poetry, and the quotations stifle the real knowledge.” The Convito is very valuable’ as giving a notion of the mind of Dante and of his scholastic education. On the other hand, his treatise De Monarchia shows us his political conception. It was probably written in 1310, when the coming of Henry VII. revived such hopes in him. He meant to prove in it that a universal monarchy is necessary to the well-being of the world, that the Roman people had a right to claim the exercise of this office, that the authority of a monarch comes straight from God and not from his vicar, the pope. The De Monarchia is written in scholastic [9:13:503] Latin, and the treatment is scholastic. Another work of Dante’s, also written in Latin, is the De Vulgari Eloquio. It seems that it was to have consisted of four books, but only two were written. His work is a defence of the “volgare illustre” (the noble vulgar tongue) against the Italian dialects. Modern criticism regards it as very superficial.^[44. See “Sul Trattato de Vulgari Eloquentia,” in the Sαggi Critici, by Francesco d’Ovidio, Naples, 1879.]

The work which made Dante immortal, and raised him above all the other men of genius in Italy, was his Divina Commedia. The author himself called it a “comedy,” as he says in his letter to Can Grande della Scala, for two reasons,—because it has, like comedies, a sad beginning and a cheerful ending, and because it is written in a “middle” style, treating alike of lofty and of lowly things. Alighieri is the protagonist of the great drama. He represents himself as lost in a forest, in a night at the end of March and in the first days of April 1300, when he was thirty-five years old. At first he is much alarmed, but afterwards he is cheered when, at dawn, he finds himself at the foot of a hill. He wishes to ascend it, but three wild beasts prevent his doing so,—a panther, a lion, and ⅜ she-wolf. When he flees back in haste to the forest, Virgil appears to him, and tells him that he is sent by Beatrice, at the command of the “Gentle Lady” (Mary) and of St Lucy. He tells him that, in order to escape from the she-wolf, he must go through hell and purgatory with him, and afterwards Beatrice herself will lead him up to heaven. Dante’s Inferno takes the shape of a deep valley, reaching down in constantly narrowing circles from the surface of our hemisphere, in the midst of which stands the mount of Jerusalem, to the centre of the earth. This valley, or inverted cone, is cut by nine circles, where the souls of the damned are tortured; they are divided into three principal classes, viz., the incontinent, the violent, and the fraudulent. The valley is shut in at its entrance by the river Acheron, and afterwards crossed by the Stygian marsh, and the rivers Phlegethon and Cocytus. The two poets pass through the ninth part of each circle, talking to some of the shades they meet, and at last they come to Lucifer, stationed in the centre of the earth. “Grappling at his hair,” they pass the centre of gravity, and begin to ascend a narrow way which brings them to the other hemisphere, They reach a little island, whence rises a very high mountain, which is purgatory. It also is divided into nine circles: in the first two are the souls of those who deferred their repentance till the hour of death; in the others the shades are cleansing themselves from the seven deadly sins. Cato of Utica guards this place. The two poets ascend the mountain, going always to the right hand. On the summit they find the earthly paradise, which is the exact antipodes to the mountain of Jerusalem. Here appear a long train of venerable persons, who precede a chariot drawn by griffins. Beatrice makes her appearance, and with her Dante takes his flight through the nine heavens, where he sees the souls of the blessed according to the order of their desert. At the tenth heaven, the Empyrean, he sees them again all together, arranged in the shape of a gleaming rose round a most dazzling centre, which is God. Here the poet contemplates the mysteries of the Trinity and of the manhood of Christ. Then the vision comes to an end.

An allegorical meaning is hidden under the literal one of the Commedia. Dante, travelling through the invisible worlds, is a symbol of mankind aiming at the double object of temporal and eternal happiness. By the forest in which the poet loses himself is meant the civil and religious confusion of society, deprived of its two guides, the emperor and the pope. The mountain illuminated by the sun is universal monarchy. The three beasts are the three vices and the three powers which offered th? greatest obstacles to Dante’s designs: envy is Florence, light, fickle, and divided by the Bianchi and Neri; pride is the house of France; avarice is the papal court; Virgil repre sents reason and the empire. Beatrice is the symbol of the supernatural aid without which man cannot attain the supreme end, which is God.

But the merit of the poem does not lie in the allegory, which still connects it with mediaeval literature. What is new in it is the individual art of the poet, the classic art transfused for the first time into a Romance form. Dante is above all a great artist. Whether he describes nature, analyses passions, curses the vices, or sings hymns to the virtues, he is always wonderful for the grandeur and delicacy of his art. Out of the rude mediaeval vision he has made the greatest work of art of modern times. He took the materials for his poem from theology, from philosophy, from history, from mythology,—but more especially from his own passions, from hatred and love; and he has breathed the breath of genius into all these materials. Under the pen of the poet, the dead come to life again; they become men again, and speak the language of their time, of their passions. Farinata degli Uberti, Boniface VIII., Count Ugolino, Manfred, Sordello, Hugh Capet, St Thomas Aquinas, Cacciaguida, St Benedict, St Peter, are all so many objective creations; they stand before us in all the life of their characters, their feelings, their habits.

Yet this world of fancy in which the poet moves is not only made living by the power of his genius, but it is changed by his consciousness. The real chastizer of the sins, the rewarder of the virtues, is Dante himself. The personal interest which he brings to bear on the historical representation of the three worlds is what most interests us and stirs us. Dante remakes history after his own passions. Thus the Divina Commedia can fairly be called, not only the most life-like drama of the thoughts and feelings that moved men at that time, but also the most clear and spontaneous reflexion of the individual feelings of the poet, from the indignation of the citizen and the exile to the faith of the believer and the ardour of the philosopher. The Divina Commedia fixed and clearly defined the destiny of Italian literature, to give artistic lustre, and hence immortality, to all the forms of literature which the Middle Ages had produced. Dante begins the great era of the Renaissance.

Two facts characterize the literary life of Petrarch (1304-1374),—classical research and the new human feeling introduced into his lyric poetry. Nor are these two facts separate; rather is the one the result of the other. The Petrarch who travelled about unearthing the works of the great Latin writers helps us to understand the Petrarch who, having completely detached himself from the Middle Ages, loved a real lady with a human love, and celebrated her in her life and after her death in poems full of studied elegance. Petrarch was the first humanist, and he was at the same time the first lyric poet of the modern school. His career was long and tempestuous. He lived for many years at Avignon, cursing the corruption of the papal court; he travelled through nearly the whole of Europe; he corresponded with emperors and popes; he was considered the first man of letters of his time; he had honours and riches; and he always bore about within him discontent, melancholy, and incapacity for satisfaction, —three characteristics of the modern man.

He wrote many Latin works, the most important of which are the Epistolae and the poem entitled Africa. He was the first to have a style of his own, and to attempt to revive the art of the Latin authors. He specially studied [9:13:504] Cicero, and endeavoured to copy him. Perhaps there was a sort of affinity between their characters. The Ep)istolae are of very great importance for the study of Petrarch’s life and mind, as well as for the history of his times. Africa is a long poem in hexameters on the campaigns of Scipio, which in places shows the gleam of genius. In the Itinerarium Syriacum, and in another work that is now lost,^[45. See Hortis, Studi suite Opere Latine del Boccaccio, Trieste, 1879, pp. 235, 236.] Petrarch appears as the first geographer of modern times.

It is not very certain who was the lady loved by Petrarch. There are some reasons for believing that she was called Laura De Noves, and was the wife of Ugo de Sade, but this is very far from being proved. It appears anyhow that the lady lived at Avignon.

The Canzoniere is divided into three parts,—the first containing the poems written during Laura’s lifetime, the second the poems written after her death, the third the Trionfi. The one and only subject of these poems is love; but the treatment is full of variety in conception, in imagery, and in sentiment, derived from the most varied impressions of nature. Petrarch’s love is real and deep, and to this is due the merit of his lyric verse, which is quite different, not only from that of the Provençal troubadours and of the Italian poets before him, but also from the lyrics of Dante. Petrarch is a psychological poet, who dives down into his own soul, examines all his feelings, and knows how to render them with an art of exquisite sweetness. The lyrics of Petrarch are no longer transcendental like Dante’s, but on the contrary keep entirely within human limits. In struggles, in doubts, in fears, in disappointments, in griefs, in joys, in fact in everything, the poet finds material for his poetry. The second part of the Canzoniere is the more passionate. The Trionfi are inferior; it is clear that in them Petrarch tried to imitate the Divina Commedia, but never came near it.

The Canzoniere includes also a few political poems,—a canzone to Italy, one supposed to be addressed to Cola di Rienzi, and several sonnets against the court of Avignon. These are remarkable for their vigour of feeling, and also for showing that Petrarch had formed the idea of Italiaηitd better even than Alighieri. The Italy which he wooed was different from any conceived by the men of the Middle Ages, and in this also he was a precursor of modern times and of modern aspirations. Petrarch had no decided political idea. He exalted Cola di Rienzi, invoked the emperor Charles IV., praised the Visconti; in fact, his politics were affected more by impressions than by principles; but above all this reigned constantly the love of Italy, his ancient and glorious country, which in his mind is reunited with Rome, the great city of his heroes Cicero and Scipio.

Boccaccio (1313-1375) had the same enthusiastic love of antiquity and the same worship for the new Italian literature as Petrarch. He was the first, with the help of a Greek born in Calabria, to put together a Latin translation of the Iliad and the Odyssey. His vast classical learning was shown specially in the work De Genealogia Deorum, in which he enumerates the gods according to genealogical trees constructed on the authority of the various authors who wrote about the pagan divinities. This work marked an era in studies preparatory to the revival of classical learning. And at the same time it opened the way for the modern criticism, because Boccaccio in his researches and in his own judgment was always independent of the authors whom he most esteemed. The Genealogia Deorum is, as Heeren said, an encyclopaedia of mythological knowledge; and it was the precursor of the great humanistic movement which was developed in the 15th century. Boccaccio was also the first historian of women in his De Claris Mulieribus, and the first to undertake to tell the story of the great unfortunate in his De Casibus Virorum Illustrium. He continued and perfected former geographical investigations in his interesting book De Montibus, Silvis, Fontibus, Lacubus, Fluminibus, Stagnis, et Paludibus, et de Nominibus Maris, for which he made use of Vibius Sequester, but which contains also many new and valuable observations. He also wrote in Latin several eclogues, some letters, and other minor compositions. Of his Italian works his lyrics do not come anywhere near to the perfection of Petrarch’s. His sonnets, mostly about love, are quite mediocre. His narrative poetry is better. Although now he can no longer claim the distinction long conceded to him of having invented the octave stanza (which afterwards became the metre of the poems of Boiardo, of Ariosto, and of Tasso), yet he was certainly the first to use it in a work of some length and written with artistic skill, such as is his Teseide. This is a poem in twelve books, and the subject is the love of two Theban youths, Arcita and Palemone, for Emilia, one of the Amazons. We find in it great luxury of description, inflated speeches, much erudition, but little poetry. However, the Teseide is the oldest Italian romantic poem. The Filostrato relates the loves of Troiolo and Griseida (Troilus and Cressida). It may be that Boccaccio knew the French poem of the Trojan war by Benoit de Sainte-More; but the interest of the Italian work lies in the analysis of the passion of love, which is treated with a masterly hand. The Ninfale Fiesolano tells the love story of the nymph Mesola and the shepherd Africo. The Amorosa Visione, a poem in triplets, doubtless owed its origin to the Dwina Commedia. The Ameto is a mixture of prose and poetry, and is the first Italian pastoral romance.

The Filocopo takes the earliest place among prose romances. In it Boccaccio tells in a laborious style, and in the most prolix way, the loves of Florio and Biancafiore. Probably for this work he drew materials from a popular source or from a Byzantine romance, which Leonzio Pilato may have mentioned to him. In the Filocσpo there is a remarkable exuberance in the mythological part, which damages the romance as an artistic work, but which contributes to the history of Boccaccio’s mind. The Fiammetta is another romance, about the loves of Boccaccio and Maria d’Aquino, a supposed natural daughter of King Robert, whom he always called by this name of Fiammetta.

The Italian work which principally made Boccaccio famous was the Decamerone, a collection of a hundred novels, related by a party of men and women, who had retired to a villa near Florence to escape from the plague in 1348. Novel-writing, so abundant in the preceding centuries, especially in France, now for the first time assumed an artistic shape. The style of Boccaccio tends to the imitation of Latin, but in him prose first took the form of elaborated art. The rudeness of the old fabliaux gives place to the careful and conscientious work of a mind that has a feeling for what is beautiful, that has studied the classic authors, and that strives to imitate them as much as possible. Over and above this, in the Decamerone, Boccaccio is a delineator of character and an observer of passions. In this lies his novelty. Much has been written about the sources of the novels of the Decamerone. Probably Boccaccio made use both of written and of oral sources. Popular tradition must have furnished him with the materials of many stories, as, for example, that of Griselda.

Unlike Petrarch, who was always discontented, preoccupied, wearied with life, disturbed by disappointments, we find Boccaccio calm, serene, satisfied with himself and with his surroundings. Notwithstanding these fundamental[9:13:505] differences in their characters, the two great authors were old and warm friends. But their affection for Dante was not equal. Petrarch, who says that he saw him once in his childhood, did not preserve a pleasant recollection of him, and it would be useless to deny that he was jealous of his renown. The Divina Commedia was sent him by Boccaccio, when he was an old man, and he confessed that he never read it. On the other hand, Boccaccio felt for Dante something more than love—enthusiasm. He wrote a biography of him, of which the accuracy is now unfairly depreciated by some critics, and he gave public critical lectures on the poem in Santa Maria del Fiore at Florence.

Fazio degli Uberti and Federigo Frezzi were imitators of the Divina Commedia, but only in its external form. The former wrote the Dittamondο, a long poem, in which the author supposes that he was taken by the geographer Solinus into different parts of the world, and that his guide related the history of them. The legends of the rise of the different Italian cities have some importance historically. Frezzi, bishop of his native town Foligno, wrote the Quadriregio, a poem of the four kingdoms—Love, Satan, the Vices, and the Virtues. This poem has many points of resemblance with the Divina Commedia. Frezzi pictures the condition of man who rises from a state of vice to one of virtue, and describes hell, the limbo, purgatory, and heaven. The poet has Pallas for a companion.

Ser Giovanni Fiorentino wrote, under the title of Pecorone, a collection of tales, which are supposed to have been related by a monk and a nun in the parlour of the monastery of Forli. He closely imitated Boccaccio, and drew on Villani’s chronicle for his historical stories. Franco Sacchetti wrote tales too, for the most part on subjects taken from Florentine history. His book gives a life-like picture of Florentine society at the end of the 14th century. The subjects are almost always improper; but it is evident that Sacchetti collected all these anecdotes in order to draw from them his own conclusions and moral reflexions, which are to be found at the end of every story. From this point of view Sacchetti’s work comes near to the Moral isationes of the Middle Ages. A third novelist was Giovanni Sercambi of Lucca, who after 1374 wrote a book, in imitation of Boccaccio, about a party of people who were supposed to fly from a plague and to go travelling about in different Italian cities, stopping here and there telling stories.

It has already been said that the chronicles formerly believed to have been of the 13th century are now regarded as forgeries of later times. At the end of the 13th century, however, we find a chronicle by Dino Compagni, which, notwithstanding the unfavourable opinion of it entertained especially by some German writers, is in all probability authentic. Little is known about the life of Compagni. Noble by birth, he was democratic in feeling, and was a supporter of the new ordinances of Giano della Bella. As prior and gonfalonier of justice he always had the public welfare at heart. When Charles of Valois, the nominee of Boniface VIII., was expected in Florence, Compagni, foreseeing the evils of civil discord, assembled a number of citizens in the church of San Giovanni, and tried to quiet their excited spirits. His chronicle relates the events that came under his own notice from 1280 to 1312. It bears the stamp of a strong subjectivity. The narrative is constantly personal. It often rises to the finest dramatic style. A strong patriotic feeling and an exalted desire for what is right pervade the book. Compagni is more an historian than a chronicler, because he looks for the reasons of events, and makes profound reflexions on them. According to our judgment he is one of the most important authorities for that period of Florentine history, notwithstanding the not insignificant mistakes in fact which are to be found in his writings. On the contrary, Giovanni Villani, born in 1300, was more of a chronicler than an historian. He relates the events up to 1347. The journeys that he made in Italy and France, and the information thus acquired, account for the fact that his chronicle, called by him Istorie Florentine, comprises events that occurred all over Europe. What specially distinguishes the work of Villani is that he speaks at length, not only of events in politics and war, but also of the stipends of public officials, of the sums of money used for paying soldiers and for public festivals, and of many other things of which the knowledge is very valuable. With such an abundance of information it is not to be wondered at that Villani’s narrative is often encumbered with fables and errors, particularly when he speaks of things that happened before his own time. Matteo was the brother of Giovanni Villani, and continued the chronicle up to 1363. It was again continued by Filippo-Villani. Gino Capponi, author of the Commentari delV Acquisto di Pisa and of the narration of the Tumulto dei Ciompi, belonged to both the 14th and the 15th centuries.

The Divina Commedia is ascetic in its conception, and in a good many points of its execution. To a large extent similar is the genius of Petrarch; yet neither Petrarch nor Dante could be classified among the pure ascetics of their time. But many other writers come under this head. St Catherine of Siena’s mysticism was political. She was a really extraordinary woman, who aspired to bring back the Church of Rome to evangelical virtue, and who has left a collection of letters written in a high and lofty tone to all kinds of people, including popes. She joins hands on the one side with Jacopone of Todi, on the other with Savonarola. Hers is the strongest, clearest, most exalted religious utterance that made itself heard in Italy in the 14th century. It is not to be thought that precise ideas of reformation entered into her head, but the want of a great moral reform was felt in her heart. And she spoke indeed ex abundantia cordis. Anyhow the daughter of Jacopo Benincasa must take her place among those who from afar off prepared the way for the religious movement which took effect, especially in Germany and England, in the 16th century.

Another Sienese, Giovanni Colombini, founder of the order of Jesuati, preached poverty by precept and example, going back to the religious idea of St Francis of Assisi. His letters are among the most remarkable in the category of ascetic works in the 14th century. Passavanti, in his Sp)ecchio della vera Penitenza, attached instruction to narrative. Cavalca translated from the Latin the Vite dei Santi Padri. Rivalta left behind him many sermons, and Franco Sacchetti (the famous novelist) many discourses. On the whole, there is no doubt that one of the most important productions of the Italian spirit of the 14th century was the religious literature.

In direct antithesis with this is a kind of literature which has a strong popular element. Humorous poetry, the poetry of laughter and jest, which as we saw was largely developed in the 13th century, was carried on in the 14th by Bindo Bonichi, Arrigo di Castruccio, Cecco Nuccoli, Andrea Orgagna, Filippo de’ Bardi, Adriano de’ Rossi, Antonid Pucci, and other lesser writers. Orgagna was specially comic; Bonichi was comic with a satirical and moral purpose. Antonio Pucci was superior to all of them for the variety of his production. He put into triplets the chronicle of Giovanni Villani (Ceηtiloquio) t and wrote many historical poems called Serventesi, many comic poems, and not a few epico-popular compositions on various subjects. A little poem of his in seven cantos treats of the war between the Florentines and the Pisans from 1362 to 1365. Other poems drawn from a legendary source celebrate the Reina d , Oriente, Apollonio di Tiro, the Bel Gherardino. &c. These poems, meant to be recited to the [9:13:506] people, are the remote ancestors of the romantic epic, which was developed in the 16th century, and the first representatives of which were Boiardo and Ariosto.

Many poets of the 14th century have left us political works. Of these Fazio degli Uberti, the author of Ditta-mondo, who wrote a Serventese to the lords and people of Italy, a poem on Rome, a fierce invective against Charles IV. of Luxemburg, deserves notice, and Francesco di Van-nozzo, Frate Stoppa, and Matteo Frescobaldi. It may be said in general that following the example of Petrarch many writers devoted themselves to patriotic poetry. From this period also dates that literary phenomenon known under the name of Petrarchism. The Petrarchists, or those who sang of love, imitating Petrarch’s manner, were found already in the 14th century. But others treated the same subject with more originality, in a manner that might be called semi-popular. Such were the Ballate of Ser Giovanni Fiorentino, of Franco Sacchetti, of Niccolo Soldanieri, of Guido and Bindo Donati. Ballate were poems sung to dancing, and we have very many songs for music of the 14th century. We have already stated that Antonio Pucci versified Villani’s Chronicle. This instance of versified history is not unique, and it is evidently connected with the precisely similar phenomenon offered by the “vulgar Latin” literature. It is enough to notice a chronicle of Arezzo in terza rima by Gorello de’ Sinigardi, and the history, also in terza rima, of the journey of Pope Alexander III. to Venice by Pier de’ Natali. Besides this, every kind of subject, whether history, tragedy, or husbandry, was treated in verse. Neri di Landocio wrote a life of St Catherine; Jacopo Gradenigo put the gospels into triplets; Paganino Bonafede in the Tesoro dei Rustici gave many precepts in agriculture, beginning that kind of Géorgie poetry which was fully developed later by Alamanni in his Coltivazione, by Girolamo Baruffaldi in the Cαnapajo, by Rucellai in the Api l by Bartolommeo Lorenzi in the Coltivazione dei Monti, by Giambattista Spolverini in the Coltivazioηe del Riso, <tc.

There cannot have been an entire absence of dramatic literature in Italy in the 14th century, but traces of it are wanting, although we find them again in great abundance in the 15th century. The 14th century had, however, one drama unique of its kind. In the sixty years (1250 to 1310) which ran from the death of the emperor Frederick II. to the expedition of Henry VII., no emperor had come into Italy. In the north of Italy, Ezzelino da Romano, with the title of imperial vicar, had taken possession of almost the whole of the March of Treviso, and threatened Lombardy. The popes proclaimed a crusade against him, and, crushed by it, the Ezzelini fell. Padua then began to breathe again, and took to extending its dominion. There was living at Padua Albertino Mussato, born in 1261, a year after the catastrophe of the Ezzelini; he grew up among the survivors of a generation that hated the name of the tyrant. After having written in Latin a history, of Henry VII., he devoted himself to a dramatic work on Ezzelino, and wrote it also in Latin. The Hccerinus, which was probably never represented on the stage, has been by some critics compared to the great tragic works of Greece. It would probably be nearer the truth to say that it has nothing in common with the works of Aeschylus; but certainly the dramatic strength, the delineation of certain situations, and the narration of certain events arc very original. Mussato’s work stands alone in the history of Italian dramatic literature. Perhaps this would not have been the case if he had written it in Italian.

In the last years of the 14th century we find the struggle that was soon to break out between the indigenous literary tradition and the reviving classicism already alive in spirit. As representatives of this struggle, of this antagonism, we may consider Luigi Marsilio and Coluccio Salutati, both learned men who spoke and wrote Latin, who aspired to be humanists, but who meanwhile also loved Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio, and felt and celebrated in their writings the beauty of Italian literature.

3. The Renaissance.— A great intellectual movement, which had been gathering for a long time, made itself felt in Italy in the 15th century. A number of men arose, all learned, laborious, indefatigable, and all intent on one great work. Such were Niccolo Niccoli, Giannozzo Manetti, Palla Strozzi, Leonardo Bruni, Francesco Filelfo, Poggio Bracciolini, Carlo d’Arezzo, Lorenzo Valla. Manetti buried himself in his books, slept only for a few hours in the night, never went out of doors, and spent his time in translating from Greek, studying Hebrew, and commenting on Aristotle. Palla Strozzi sent into Greece at his own expense to search for ancient books, and had Plutarch and Plato brought for him. Poggio Bracciolini went to the council of Constance, and found in a monastery in the dust-hole Cicero’s Orations. He copied Quintilian with his own hand, discovered Lucretius, Plautus, Pliny, and many other Latin authors. Guarino went through the East in search of codices. Giovanni Λurispa returned to Venice with many hundreds of manuscripts. What was the passion that excited all these men? What did they search after? What did they look to? These Italians were but handing on the solemn tradition which, although partly latent, was the informing principle of Italian mediaeval history, and now at length came out triumphant. This tradition was that same tenacious and sacred memory of Rome, that same worship of its language and institutions, which at one time had retarded the development of Italian literature, and now grafted the old Latin branch of ancient classicism on the flourishing stock of Italian literature. All this is but the continuation of a phenomenon that has existed for ages. It is the thought of Rome that always dominates Italians, the thought that keeps appearing from Boetius to Dante Alighieri, from Arnold of Brescia to Cola di Rienzi, which gathers strength with Petrarch and Boccaccio, and finally becomes triumphant in literature and life,—in life, because the modern spirit is fed on the works of the ancients. Men come to have a more just idea of nature: the world is no longer cursed or despised; truth and beauty join hands; man is born again; and human reason resumes its rights. Everything, the individual and society, are changed under the influence of new facts.

First of all there was formed a human individuality, which was wanting in the Middle Ages. As Burckhardt has said, the man was changed into the individual. He began to feel and assert his own personality, which was constantly attaining a fuller realization. As a consequence of this, the idea of fame and the desire for it arose. A really cultured class was formed, in the modern meaning of the word, and the conception was arrived at (completely unknown in former times) that the worth of a man did not depend at all on his birth but on his personal qualities. Poggio in his dialogue De Nol>ilitate declares that he entirely agreed with his interlocutors Niccol5 Niccoli and Lorenzo de’ Medici in the opinion that there is no other nobility but that of personal merit. External life was growing more refined in all particulars; the man of society was created; rules for civilized life were made; there was ⅝n increasing desire for sumptuous and artistic entertainments. The mediaeval idea of existence was turned upside down: men who had hitherto turned their thoughts exclusively to heavenly things, and believed exclusively in the divine right, now began to think of beautifying their earthly existence, of making it happy and gay, and returned to a belief in their human rights. This was a great [9:13:507] advance, but one which carried with it the seeds of many dangers. The conception of morality became gradually weaker. The “fay ce que vouldras” of Rabelais became the first principle of life. Religious feeling was blunted, was weakened, was changed, became pagan again. Finally the Italian of the Renaissance, in his qualities and his passions, became the most remarkable representative of the heights and depths, of the virtues and faults, of humanity. Corruption was associated with all that is most ideal in life; a profound scepticism took hold of people’s minds; indifference to good and evil reached its highest point.

Besides this, a great literary danger was hanging over Italy. Humanism threatened to submerge its youthful national literature. There were authors who laboriously tried to give Italian Latin forms, to do again, after Dante’s time, what Guittone d’Arezzo had so unhappily done in the 13th century. Provincial dialects tried to reassert themselves in literature. The great authors of the 14th century, Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio, were by many people forgotten or despised.

It was Florence that saved literature by reconciling, the classical models to modern feeling, Florence that succeeded in assimilating classical forms to the “vulgar” art. Still gathering vigour and elegance from classicism, still drawing from the ancient fountains all that they could supply of good and useful, it was able to preserve its real life, to keep its national traditions, and to guide literature along the way that had been opened to it by the writers of the preceding century. At Florence the most celebrated humanists wrote also in the vulgar tongue, and commented on Dante and Petrarch, and defended them from their enemies. Leon Battista Alberti, the learned Greek and Latin scholar, wrote in the vernacular, and Vespasiano da Bisticci, whilst he was constantly absorbed in Greek and Latin manuscripts, wrote the Vite di Comini Illustri, valuable for their historical contents, and rivalling the best works of the 14th century in their candour and simplicity. Andrea da Barberino wrote the beautiful prose of the Real·i di Francia, giving a colouring of “romanità” to the chivalrous romances. Belcari and Benivieni carry us back to the mystic idealism of earlier times.

But it is in Lorenzo de’ Medici that the influence of Florence on the Renaissance is particularly seen. In forming an opinion of him many people are led away by political preconceptions. Even as a statesman, Lorenzo h as a conspicuous place in the history of his time, and in our day it will not be deemed reasonable to expect that in the age of lordships and principalities he alone should stand out from his time, and not feel the influence of the general condition of Italy. With this, however, we have nothing to do. We have to consider Lorenzo de’ Medici as a man of letters; and as such he is one about whom tradition and reality best agree. His mind was formed by the ancients: he attended the class of the Greek Argyropulos, sat at Platonic banquets, took pains to collect codices, sculptures, vases, pictures, gems, and drawings to ornament the gardens of San Marco and to form the library afterwards called by his name. In the saloons of his Florentine palace, in his villas at Careggi, Fiesole, and Ambra, stood the wonderful chests painted by Dello with stories from Ovid, the Hercules of Pollajuolo, the Pallas of Botticelli, the works of Filippino and Verrocchio. Lorenzo de’ Medici lived entirely in the classical world; and yet if we read his poems we only see the man of his time, the admirer of Dante and of the old Tuscan poets, wdιo takes inspiration from the popular muse, and wdιo succeeds in giving to his poetry the colours of the most pronounced realism, as well as of the loftiest idealism,—who passes from the Platonic sonnet to the impassioned triplets of the A mom di Venere, from the grandiosity of the Salve to Neηcia and to Beoni, from the Canto Camascialesco to the Lauda. The feeling of nature is strong in him,—at one time sweet and melancholy, at another vigorous and deep, as if an echo of the feelings, the sorrows, the ambitions of that deeply agitated life. He liked to look into his own heart with a severe eye, but he was also able to pour himself out with tumultuous fulness. He described with the art of a sculptor; he satirized, laughed, prayed, sighed, always elegant, always a Florentine, but a Florentine who read Anacreon, Ovid, and Tibullus, who wished to enjoy life,but also to taste of the refinements of art.

Next to Lorenzo comes Poliziano, who also united, and with greater art, the ancient and the modern, the popular and the classical style. In his Rispetti and in his Ballate the freshness of imagery and the plasticity of form are inimitable. He, a great Greek scholar, wrote Italian verses with dazzling colours; the purest elegance of the Greek sources pervaded his art in all its varieties, in the Orfeo as well as the Stanze per la Ciostra.

As a consequence of the intellectual movement towards the Renaissance, there arose in Italy in the 15th century three academies, those of Florence, of Naples, and of Rome. The Florentine academy was founded by Cosmo I. de’ Medici. Having heard the praises of Platonic philosophy sung byGemistus Pletho, who in 1439 was at the council of Florence, he took such a liking for those opinions that he soon made a plan for a literary congress which was especially to discuss them. Marsilius Ficinus has described the occupations and the entertainments of these academicians. Here, he said, the young men learnt, by way of pastime, precepts of conduct and the practice of eloquence; here grown-up men studied the government of the republic and the family; here the aged consoled themselves with the belief in a future world. The academy was divided into three classes :—that of patrons, who were members of the Medici family; that of hearers, among whom sat the most famous men of that age, such as Pico della Mirandola, Angelo Poliziano, Leon Battista Alberti; that of disciples, who were youths anxious to distinguish themselves in philosophical pursuits. It is known that the Platonic academy endeavoured to promote, with regard to art, a second and a more exalted revival of antiquity. The Roman academy was founded by Giulio Pomponio Leto, with the object of promoting the discovery and the investigation of ancient monuments and books. It was a sort of religion of classicism, mixed with learning and philosophy. Platina, the celebrated author of the lives of the first hundred popes, belonged to it. At Naples, the academy known as· the Pontaniana was instituted. The founder of it was Antonio Beccadelli, surnamed II Panormita, and after his death the head was II Pontano, who gave his name to it, and whose mind animated it.

Romantic poems were the product of the moral scepticism and the artistic taste of the 15th century. Italy never had any true epic poetry in its period of literary birth. Still less could it have any in the Renaissance. It had, however, many poems called Cantam, because they contained stories that were sung to the people; and besides there were romantic poems, such as the Buovo d ’ Aηtoηa, the Regina Ancroja, and others. But the first to introduce elegance and a new life into this style was Luigi Pulci, who grew up in the house of the Medici, and who wrote the Morgante Maggiore at the request of Lucrezia Tornabuoni, mother of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The material of the Morgante is almost completely taken from an obscure chivalrous poem of the 15th century recently discovered by Professor Pio Rajna. On this foundation Pulci erected a structure of his own, often turning the subject into ridicule, burlesquing the characters, introducing many digressions, now capricious, now scientific, now theological. Pulci’s merit consists in having been the first to [9:13:508] raise the romantic epic which had been for two centuries in the hands of story-tellers into a work of art, and in having united the serious and the comic, thus happily depicting the manners and feelings of the time. With a more serious intention Matteo Boiardo, count of Scandiano, wrote his Orlando innamorato, in which he seems to have aspired to embrace the whole range of Carlovingian legends; but he did not complete his task. We find here too a large vein of humour and burlesque. Still the Ferrarese poet is drawn to the world of romance by a profound sympathy for chivalrous manners and feelings,—that is to say, for love, courtesy, valour, and generosity. A third romantic poem of the 15th century was the Marnbriaηo by Francesco Bello (Cieco of Ferrara). He drew from the Carlovingian cycle, from the romances of the Round Table, from classical antiquity. He was a poet of no common genius, and of ready imagination. He showed the influence of Boiardo, especially in something of the fantastic which he introduced into his work.

The development of the drama in the 15th century was very great. This kind of semi-popular literature was born in Florence, and attached itself to certain popular festivities that were usually held in honour of St John the Baptist, patron saint of the city. The Sacra Pappresentaziane is in substance nothing more than the development of the mediaeval Mistero (“mystery-play”). Although it belonged to popular poetry, some of its authors were literary men of much renown. It is enough to notice Lorenzo de’ Medici, who wrote San Giovanni e Paolo, and Feo Belcari, author of the San Panunzio, the Abramo ed Isac, &c. From the 15th century, some element of the comic-profane found its way into the Sacra Pappresentaziane. From its Biblical and legendary conventionalism Poliziano emancipated himself in his Orfeo, which, although in its exterior form belonging to the sacred representations, yet substantially detaches itself from them in its contents and in the artistic element introduced.

From Petrarch onwards the eclogue was a kind of literature that much pleased the Italians. In it, however, the pastoral element is only apparent, for there is nothing really rural in it. Such is the Arcadia of Jacopo Sannazzaro of Naples, author of a wearisome Latin poem De Partu Virginis, and of some piscatorial eclogues. The Arcadia is divided into ten eclogues, in which the festivities, the games, the sacrifices, the manners of a colony of shepherds are described. They are written in elegant verses, but it would be vain to look in them for the remotest feeling of country life. On the other hand, even in this style, Lorenzo de’ Medici was. superior. His Nencia da Barberνno, as a modern writer says, is as it were the new and clear reproduction of the popular songs of the environs of Florence, melted into one majestic wave of octave stanzas. Lorenzo threw himself into the spirit of the bare realism of country life. There is a marked contrast between this work and the conventional bucolic of Sannazzaro and other writers. A rival of the Medici in this style, but always inferior to him, was Luigi Pulci in his Beca da Dicomano.

The lyric love poetry of this century was unimportant. In its stead we see a completely new style arise, the Canto Carηascialesco. These were a kind of choral songs, which were accompanied with symbolical masquerades, common in Florence at the carnival. They were written in a metre like that of the ballate; and for the most part they were put into the mouth of a party of workmen and tradesmen, who, with not very chaste allusions, sang the praises of their art. These triumphs and masquerades were directed by Lorenzo himself. At eventide there set out into the city large companies on horseback, playing and singing these songs. There are some by Lorenzo himself, which surpass all the others in their mastery of art. That entitled Bacco ed Arianna is the most famous.

Girolamo Savonarola arose to fight against the literary and social movement of the Renaissance. He was a Ferrarese friar, born in 1452, and he came to Florence in 1489. Some have tried to make out that Savonarola was an apostle of liberty, others that he v r as a precursor of the Reformation. In truth, however, he was neither the one nor the other. In his struggle with Lorenzo de’ Medici, he directed his attack against the promoter of classical studies, the patron of pagan literature, rather than against the political tyrant. Animated by mystic zeal, he took the line of a prophet, preaching against reading voluptuous authors, against the tyranny of the Medici, and calling for popular government. This, however, was not done from a desire for civil liberty, but because Savonarola saw in Lorenzo and his court the greatest obstacle to that return to Catholic doctrine which was his heart’s desire; while he thought this return would be easily accomplished if, on the fall of the Medici, the Florentine republic should come into the hands of his supporters. There may be more justice in looking on Savonarola as the forerunner of the Reformation. If he was so, it was more than he intended. The friar of Ferrara never thought of attacking the papal dogma, and always maintained that he washed to remain within the church of Rome. He had none of the great aspirations of Luther. He only repeated the complaints and the exhortations of St Catherine of Siena; he desired a reform of manners, entirely of manners, not of doctrine. He prepared the ground for the German and English religious movement of the 16th century, but unconsciously. In the history of Italian civilization he represents retrogression, that is to say, the cancelling of the great fact of the Renaissance, and return to-mediaeval ideas. His attempt to put himself in opposition to his time, to arrest the course of events, to bring the people back to the faith of the past, the belief that all the social evils came from a Medici and a Borgia, his not seeing the historical reality as it was, his aspiring to found a republic with Jesus Christ for its king,—all these things show that Savonarola was more of a fanatic than a thinker. Nor has he any great merit as a writer. He wrote Italian sermons, hymns (laudi), ascetic and political treatises, but they are roughly executed, and only important as throwing light on the history of his ideas. The religious poems of Girolamo Benivieni are better than his, and are drawn from the same inspirations. In these lyrics, sometimes sweet, always warm with religious feeling, Benivieni and with him Feo Belcari carry us back to the literature of the 14th century.

History had neither many nor very good students in the 15th century. Its revival belonged to the following age. It was mostly written in Latin. Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo wrote the history of Florence, Gioviano Pontano that of Naples, in Latin. Bernardino Corio wrote the history of Milan in Italian, but in a rude way.

Leonardo da Vinci wrote a treatise on painting, Leon Battista Alberti one on sculpture and architecture. But the names of these two men are important, not so much as authors of these treatises, but as being embodiments of another characteristic of the age of the Renaissance,·— versatility of genius, power of application along many and varied lines, and of being excellent in all. · Leonardo was an architect, a poet, a painter, an hydraulic engineer, and a distinguished mathematician. Alberti was a musician, studied jurisprudence, was an architect and a draughtsman, and had great fame in literature. He had a deep feeling for nature, an almost unique faculty of assimilating all that he saw and heard. Leonardo and Alberti are representatives and almost a compendium in themselves of all that intellectual vigour of the Renaissance age, which in the [9:13:509] 16th century took to developing itself in its individual parts, making way for what has by some been called the golden age of Italian literature.

4. Development of the .Renaissance.— The fundamental characteristic of the literary epoch following that of the Renaissance is that it perfected itself in every kind of art, in particular uniting the essentially Italian character of its language with classicism of style. This period lasted from about 1494 to about 1560; and, strange to say, this very period of greater fruitfulness and literary greatness began from the year 1494, which with Charles VIII.’s descent into Italy marked the beginning of its political decadence and of foreign domination over it. But this is not hard to explain. All the most famous men of the first half of the 16th had been educated in the preceding century. Pietro Pomponazzo was born in 1462, Marcello Virgilio Adriani in 1464, Castiglione in 1468, Machiavelli in 1469, Bembo in 1470, Michelangelo Buonarroti and Ariosto in 1474, Nardi in 1476, Trissino in 1478, Guicciardini in 1482. Thus it is easy to understand how the literary activity which showed itself from the end of the 15th century to the middle of the following one was the product of the political and social conditions of the age in which these minds were formed, not of that in which their powers were displayed.

Niccolo Machiavelli and Francesco Guicciardini were the chief originators of the science of history. Machiavelli’s principal works are the Istorie Florentine, the Discorsi sulla prima Deca di Tito Livio, the Arte della Guerra, and the Principe. His merit consists in having been the creator of the experimental science of politics,—in having observed facts, studied histories, and drawn consequences from them. His history is sometimes inexact in facts; it is rather a political than an historical work. The peculiarity of Machiavelli’s genius lay, as has been said, in his artistic feeling for the treatment and discussion of politics in and for themselves, without regard to an immediate end,—in his power of abstracting himself from the partial appearances of the transitory present, in order more thoroughly to possess himself of the eternal and inborn kingdom, and to bring it into subjection to himself. His Principe has been the subject of the severest accusations. But now, especially since Macaulay’s essay, it is clear to every one that this book was only the result of the civil and moral conditions of Italy, as it still is the faithful portrait of them.^[46. Hitherto there has been no complete and objective study on Machiavelli, although very much has been written about him. This want, it is hoped, will be supplied when Signor Villari has completed his work, of which only the first volume has as yet appeared, Niccοlο Machiavelli ei suοi tempi illustrali con nuovi documenti, Florence, 1877.]

Next to Machiavelli both as an historian and a statesman, comes Francesco Guicciardini. He taught law for many years at Florence; then, having devoted himself to politics, he was always in the service of the Medici. Leo X. made him governor of Modena, Reggio, and Parma. Clement VII. gave him the appointment of president of the Romagna, and afterwards that of lieutenant-general of the army against Charles V., and finally that of governor of Bologna. He worked for the return of the Medici to Florence, defending Duke Alexander from the accusations of the exiles and supporting the election of Cosmo I. Guicciardini was very observant, and endeavoured to reduce his observations to a science. His Storia d'Italia, which extends from the death of Lorenzo de’ Medici to 1534, is full of political wisdom, is skilfully arranged in its parts, gives a lively picture of the character of the persons it treats of, and is written in a grand style. He shows a profound knowledge of the human heart, and depicts with truth the temperaments, the capabilities, and the habits of the different European nations. Going back to the causes of events, he looked for the explanation of the divergent interests of princes and of their reciprocal jealousies. The fact of his having witnessed many of the events he related, and having taken part in them, adds authority to his words. The political reflexions are always deep: in the Pensieri, as Capponi^[47. Storia della Rernd>blica di Firenze, Florence, 1876.] says, he seems to aim at extracting through self-examination a quintessence, as it were, of the things observed and done by him,—thus endeavouring to form a political doctrine as adequate as possible in all its parts. Machiavelli and Guicciardini may be considered, not only as distinguished historians, but as originators of the science of history founded on observation.

Inferior to them, but still always worthy of note, were Jacopo Nardi (a just and faithful historian and a virtuous man, who defended the rights of Florence against the Medici before Charles V.), Benedetto Varchi, Giambattista Adriani, Bernardo Segni; and, outside Tuscany, Camillo Porzio, who related the Congiura de ’ Baroni and the history of Italy from 1547 to 1552, Angelo di Costanza, Pietro Bembo, Paolo Paruta, and others.

Ariosto’s Orlando Furioso was a continuation of Boiardo’s Innam orato. His characteristic is that he assimilated the romance of chivalry to the style and models of classicism. Ariosto was an artist only for the love of his art; his sole aim was to make a romance that should please the generation in which he lived. His Orlando has no grave and serious purpose; on the contrary it creates a fantastic world, in which thé poet rambles, indulging his caprice, and sometimes smiling at his own work. His great desire is to depict everything with the greatest possible perfection; the cultivation of style is what occupies him most. In his hands, the style becomes wonderfully plastic to every conception, whether high or low, serious or sportive. The octave stanza reached in him the highest perfection of grace, variety, and harmony.

Meanwhile, side by side with the romantic, there was an attempt at the historical epic. Gian Giorgio Trissino of Vicenza composed a poem called Italia liberata dai Goti. Full of learning and of the rules of the ancients, he formed himself on the latter, in order to sing of the campaigns of Belisarius; he said that he had forced himself to observe all the rules of Aristotle, and that he had imitated Homer. In this again, we see one of the products of the Renaissance; and, although Trissino’s work is poor in invention and without any original poetical colouring, yet it helps one to understand better what were the conditions of mind in the 16th century.

Lyric poetry was certainly not one of the kinds that rose to any great height in the 16th century. Originality was entirely wanting, since it seemed in that century as if nothing better could be done than to copy Petrarch. Still, even in this style there were some vigorous poets. Monsignore Giovanni Guidiccioni of Lucca (1500-1541) showed that he had a generous heart. In fine sonnets he gave expression to his grief for the sad state to which his country was reduced. Francesco Molza of Modena (1489- 1544), learned in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, wrote in a graceful style and with spirit. Giovanni della Casa (1503- 1556) and Pietro Bembo (1470-1547), although Petrarchists, were elegant. Even Michelangelo Buonarroti was at times a Petrarchist, but his poems bear the stamp of his extraordinary and original genius. And a good many ladies are to be placed near these poets, such as Vittoria Colonna (loved by Michelangelo), Veronica Gambara, Tullia d’Aragona, Giulia Gonzaga, poetesses of great delicacy, and. superior in genius to many literary men of their time.

The 16th century had not a few tragedies, but they are [9:13:510] all weak. The cause of this was the moral and religious indifference of the Italians, the lack of strong passions and vigorous characters. The first to occupy the tragic stage was Trissino with his Sofonisba, following the rules of the art most scrupulously, but written in sickly verses, and without warmth of feeling. The Oreste and the Ros-muηda of Giovanni Rucellai were no better, nor Luigi Alamanni’s Antigone. Sperone Speroni in his Canace and Giraldi Cintio in his Orbecche tried to become innovators in tragic literature, but they only succeeded in making it grotesque. Decidedly superior to these was the Torris-mondo of Torquato Tasso, specially remarkable for the choruses, which sometimes remind one of the chorus of the Greek tragedies.

The Italian comedy of the 16th century was almost entirely modelled on the Latin comedy. They were almost always alike in the plot, in the characters of the old man, of the servant, of the waiting-maid; and the argument was often the same. Thus the Lucidi of Agnolo Firenzuola, and the Vecchio Amoroso of Donato Giannotti were modelled on comedies by Plautus, as were the Sporta by Gelli, the Marito by Dolce, and others. There appear to be only three writers who should be distinguished among the many who wrote comedies,—Machiavelli, Ariosto, and Giovan Maria Cecchi. In his Mandragora Machiavelli, unlike all the others, composed a comedy of character, creating types which seem living even now, because they were copied from reality seen with a finely observant eye. Ariosto, on the other hand, was distinguished for his picture of the habits of his time, and especially of those of the Ferrarese nobles, rather than for the objective delineation of character. Lastly, Cecchi left in his comedies a treasure of spoken language, which nowadays enables us in a wonderful way to make ourselves acquainted with that age. The notorious Pietro Aretino might also be included in the list of the best writers of comedy.

The 15th century was not without humorous poetry; Antonio Camnielli, surnamed the Pistoian, is specially deserving of notice, because of his “pungent bonhomie? as Sainte-Beuve called it. But it was Francesco Berni who carried this kind of literature to perfection in the 16th century. From him the style has been called “bernesque” poetry. In the “Berneschi” we find nearly the same phenomenon that we already noticed with regard to Orlando Furioso. It was art for art’s sake that inspired and moved Berni to write, as well as Anton Francesco Grazzini called Il Lasca, and other lesser writers. It may be said that there is nothing in their poetry; and it is true that they specially delight in praising low and disgusting things and in jeering at what is noble and serious. Bernesque poetry is the clearest refl exion of that religious and moral scepticism which was one of the characteristics of Italian social life in the 16th century, and which showed itself more or less in all the works of that period, that scepticism which stopped the religious Reformation in Italy, and which in its turn was an effect of historical conditions. The Berneschi, and especially Berni himself, sometimes assumed a satirical tone. But theirs could not be called true satire. Pure satirists, on the other hand, were Antonio Vinciguerra, a Venetian, Lodovico Alamanni, and Ariosto, the last superior to the others for the Attic elegance of his style, and for a certain frankness, passing into malice, which is particularly interesting when the poet talks of himself.

In the 16th century there were not a few didactic works. In his poem of the Api Giovanni Rucellai approaches to the perfection of Virgil. His style is clear and light, and he adds interest to his book by frequent allusions to the events of the time. But of the didactic works that which surpasses all the others in importance is Baldassare Castiglione’s Cortigiano, in which he imagines a discussion in the palace of the dukes of Urbino between knights and ladies as to what are the gifts required in a perfect courtier. This book is valuable as an illustration of the intellectual and moral state of the highest Italian society in the first half of the 16th century.

Of the novelists of the 16th century, the two most important were Anton Francesco Grazzini and Matteo Bandello,—the former as playful and bizarre as the latter is grave and solemn. As part of the history of the times, we must not forget that Bandello was a Dominican friar and a bishop, but that notwithstanding his novels were very loose in subject, and that he often holds up the ecclesiastics of his time to ridicule.

At a time when admiration for qualities of style, the desire for classical elegance, was so strong as in the 16th century, much attention was naturally paid to translating Latin and Greek authors. Among the very numerous translations of the time those of the Aeneid and of the Pastorals of Longus the Sophist by Annibal Caro are still famous; as are also the translations of Ovid’s Metamorphoses by Giovanni Andrea dell’ Anguillare, of Apuleius’s Golden Ass by Firenzuola, and of Plutarch’s Lives and Moralia by Marcello Adriani.

The historians of Italian literature are even now in doubt whether Tasso should be placed in the period of the highest development of the Renaissance, or whether he should form a period by himself, intermediate between that and the one following. Certainly he was profoundly out of harmony with the century in which he lived. His religious faith, the seriousness of his character, the deep melancholy settled in his heart, his continued aspiration after an ideal perfection, all place him as it were outside the literary epoch represented by Machiavelli, by Ariosto, by Berni. As Carducci has well said, Tasso “is the legitimate heir of Dante Alighieri: he believes, and reasons on his faith by philosophy; he loves, and comments on his love in a learned style; he is an artist, and writes dialogues of scholastic speculation that would fain be Platonic.” He was only eighteen years old when, in 1562,he tried his hand at epic poetry, and wrote Rinaldo, in which he said that he had tried to reconcile the Aristotelian rules with the variety of Ariosto. He afterwards wrote the Aminta, a pastoral drama of exquisite grace. But the work to which he had long turned his thoughts was an heroic poem, and that absorbed all his powers. He himself explains what his intention was in the three Discorsi written whilst he was composing the Gerusalemme: he would choose a great and wonderful subject, not so ancient as to have lost all interest, nor so recent as to prevent the poet from embellishing it with invented circumstances; he meant to treat it rigorously according to the rules of the unity of action observed in Greek and Latin poems, but with a far greater variety and splendour of episodes, so that in this point it should not fall short of the romantic poem; and finally, he would write it in a lofty and ornate style. This is what Tasso has done in the Gerusalemme Liberata, the subject of which is the liberation of the sepulchre of Jesus Christ in the 11th century by Godfrey of Bouillon. The poet does not follow faithfully all the historical facts, but sets before us the principal causes of them, bringing in the supernatural agency of God and Satan. The Gerusalemme is the best heroic poem that Italy can show. It approaches to classical perfection. Its episodes above all are most beautiful. There is profound feeling in it, and everything reflects the melancholy soul of the poet. As regards the style, however, although Tasso studiously endeavoured to keep close to the classical models, one cannot help noticing that he makes excessive use of metaphor, of antithesis, of far fetched conceits; and it is [9:13:511] specially from this point of view that some historians have placed Tasso in the literary period generally known under the name of “Secentismo,” and that others, more moderate in their criticism, have said that he prepared the way for it.

5. Period of Decadence.— From about 1559 began a period of decadence in Italian literature. The Spanish rule oppressed and corrupted the peninsula. The minds of men were day by day gradually losing their force; every high aspiration was quenched. No love of country could any longer be felt when the country was enslaved to a stranger. The suspicious rulers fettered all freedom of thought and word; they tortured Campanella, burned Bruno, made every effort to extinguish all high sentiment, all desire for good. Cesare Balbo says, “if the happiness of the masses consists in peace without industry, if the nobility’s consists in titles without power, if princes are satisfied by acquiescence in their rule without real independence, without sovereignty, if literary men and artists are content to write, paint, and build with the approbation of their contemporaries, but to the contempt of posterity, if a whole nation is happy in ease without dignity and the tranquil progress of corruption,—then no period ever was so happy for Italy as the hundred and forty years from the treaty of Cateau Cambresis to the war of the Spanish succession.” This period is known in the history of Italian literature as the Secentismo. Its writers, devoid of sentiment, of passion, of thoughts, resorted to exaggeration; they tried to produce effect with every kind of affectation, with bombast, with the strangest metaphors, in fact, with what in art is called mannerism, “barocchism.” The utter poverty of the matter tried to cloak itself under exuberance of forms. It seemed as if the writers vied with one another as to who could best burden his art with useless metaphors, with phrases, with big-sounding words, with affectations, with hyperbole, with oddities, with everything that could fix attention on the outer form and draw it off from the substantial element of thought.

At the head of the school of the “Secentisti” comes Giovan Battista Marini of Naples, born in 1569, especially known by a poem called H Adone. His aim was to excite wonder by novelties; hence the most extravagant metaphors, the most forced antitheses, the most far-fetched conceits, are to be found in his book. It was especially by antitheses that he thought he could produce the greatest effect. Sometimes he strings them together one after the other, so that they fill up whole stanzas without a break. Achillini of Bologna followed in Marini’s steps. He had less genius, however, and hence his peculiarities were more extravagant, becoming indeed absolutely ridiculous. In general, we may say that all the poets of the 17th century were more or less infected with “Marinism.” Thus Alessandro Guidi, although he does not attain to the exaggeration of his master, is emptily bombastic, inflated, turgid, while Fulvio Testi is artificial and affected. Yet Guidi as well as Testi felt the influence of another poet, Gabriello Chiabrera, born at Savona in 1552. In him the Secentismo took another character. Enamoured as he said he was of the Greeks, he made new metres, especially in imitation of Pindar, treating of religious, moral, historical, and amatory subjects. It is easy to understand that a Pindaric style of poetry in the 17th century in Italy could not but end in being altogether artificial, without anything of those qualities which constitute the greatness of the Greek poet. Chiabrera, though elegant enough in form, proves empty of matter, and, in his vain attempt to hide this vacuity, has recourse to poetical ornaments of every kind. These again, in their turn, become in him a fresh defect. Nevertheless, Chiabrera’s school, in the decadence of the 17th century, marks an improvement; and sometimes he showed that he had lyrical capacities, which in better literary surroundings would have brought forth excellent fruit. When he sings, for example, of the victories of the Tuscan galleys against the Turks and the pirates of the Mediterranean, he rises to grand imagery, and seems quite another poet.

Filicaia the Florentine has a certain lyric elan, particularly in the songs about Vienna besieged by the Turks, which seems to raise him more than the others above the vices of the time; but even in him we see clearly the rhetorical artifice and the falseness of the conceits. And in general all the lyric poetry of the 17th century may be said to have had the same defects, but in different degrees, —defects which may be summed up as absence of feeling and exaggeration of form. There was no faith; there was no love; and thus art became an exercise, a pastime, a luxury, for a servile and corrupt people.

The belief then arose that it would be sufficient to change the form in order to restore literature, in forgetfulness that every reform must be the effect of a change in social and moral conditions. Weary of the bombastic style of the 17th century, full of conceits and antithesis, men said— let us follow an entirely different line, let us fight the turgid style with simplicity. In 1690 the “Academy of Arcadia” was instituted. Its founders were Giovan Maria Crescimbeni and Gian Vincenzo Gravina. The Arcadia was so called because its chief aim and intention were to imitate in literature the simplicity of the ancient shepherds, who were fabulously supposed to have lived in Arcadia in the golden age. As the “Secentisti” erred by an overweening desire for novelty, which made them always go beyond the truth, so the Arcadians proposed to themselves to return to the fields of truth, always singing of subjects of pastoral simplicity. This was obviously nothing else than the substitution of a new artifice for the old one; and they fell from bombast into effeminacy, from the hyperbolical into the petty, from the turgid into the over-refined. The Arcadia was a reaction against Secentismo, but a reaction which, reversing the movement of that earlier epoch, only succeeded in impoverishing still further and completely withering up the literature. The poems of the “Arcadians” fill many volumes, and are made up of sonnets, madrigals, canzonets, and blank verse. The one who most distinguished himself among the sonneteers was Felice Zappi. Among the authors of songs Paolo Rolli was illustrious. Innocenzo Frugoni was more famous than all the others, a man of fruitful imagination but of shallow intellect, whose wordy verses nobody now reads.

Whilst the political and social conditions in Italy in the 17th century were such as to make it appear that every light of intelligence, all spirit of liberty, was extinguished, there appeared in the peninsula, by that law of reaction which in great part governs human events, some strong and independent thinkers, such as Bernardino Telesio, Giordano Bruno, Tommaso Campanella, Lucilio Vanini, who turned philosophical inquiry into fresh channels, and opened the way for the scientific conquests of Galileo Galilei, the great contemporary of Descartes in France and of Bacon in England. Galileo was not only a great man of science, but also occupied a conspicuous place in the history of letters. A devoted student of Ariosto, he seemed to transfuse into his prose the qualities of that great poet,—a clear and frank freedom of expression, a wonderful art of knowing how to say everything with precision and ease, and at the same time with elegance. Galileo’s prose is in perfect antithesis to the poetry of his time. Perhaps it is the best prose that Italy has ever had; it is clear, goes straight to the point, is without rhetorical ornaments and without vulgar slips, artistic without appearing to be so.

Another symptom of revival, a sign of rebellion against [9:13:512] the vileness of Italian social life, is given us in satire and in particular in that of Salvator Rosa and Alessandro Tassoni. Salvator Rosa, born in 1615, near Naples, was a painter, a musician, and a poet. As a poet he showed that he felt the sad condition of his country, showed that he mourned over it, and gave vent to his feeling (as another satire-writer, Giuseppe Giusti, said) in generosi rabbuffi. His exhortation to Italian poets to turn their thoughts to the miseries of their country as a subject for their song —their country languishing under the tyrant’s hands— certain passages where he deplores the effeminacy of Italian habits, a strong apostrophe against Rome, make Salvator Rosa a precursor of the patriotic literature which inaugurated the revival of the 18th century. Tassoni, a man really quite exceptional in this century, was superior to Rosa. He showed independent judgment in the midst of universal servility, and his Secchia Rapita proved that he was an eminent writer. This is an heroic comic poem, which is at the same time an epic and a personal satire. He was bold enough to attack the Spaniards in his Fil·ippiche, in which he urged Duke Carlo Emanuele of Savoy to persist in the war against them.

6. The Revival in the 18z7i Century.— Having for the most part freed itself from the Spanish dominion in the 18th century, the political condition of Italy began to improve. Promoters of this improvement, which was shown in many civil reforms, were Joseph II., Leopold I., and Charles I. The work of these princes was copied from the philosophers, who in their turn felt the influence of a general movement of ideas, which was quietly working in many parts of Europe, and which came to a head in the French encyclopedists.

Giambattista Vico was a token of the awakening of historical consciousness in Italy. In his Scienza Nuova he applied himself to the investigation of the laws governing the progress of the human race, and according to which events are developed. From the psychological study of man he endeavoured to infer the “comune natura delle nazioni,” i.e., the universal laws of history, or the laws by which civilizations rise, flourish, and fall.

From the same scientific spirit which animated the philosophical investigation of Vico, there was born a different kind of investigation, that of the sources of Italian civil and literary history. Lodovico Antonio Muratori, after having collected in one entire body (Rerum Italicarum Scriptores) the chronicles, the biographies, the letters, and the diaries of Italian history from 500 to 1500, after having discussed the most obscure historical questions in the Antiquitates Italicae Medii Aevi, wrote the Annali cι Dalia, minutely narrating facts derived from authentic sources. Muratori’s associates in his historical researches were Scipione Maffei of Verona and Apostolo Zeno of Venice. In his Verona illustrata the former left, not only a treasure of learning, but an excellent specimen of historical monograph. The latter added much to the erudition of literary history, both in his Dissertazioni Vossiane and in his notes to the Biblioteca delΓ Eloquenza Italiana of Monsignore Giusto Fontanini. Girolamo Tiraboschi and the Count Giovanni Maria Mazzuchelli of Brescia devoted themselves to literary history. The latter meant to give in his Scrittori T Italia, not only the biography of all the writers, but an account of their works. Only six volumes were printed, containing the letters A and B; but the immense materials collected by him are in the Vatican library, and it is to be hoped that some day they may be arranged and published.

While the new spirit of the times led men to the investigation of historical sources, it also led them to inquire into the mechanism of economical and social laws. Francesco Galiani wrote on currency; Gaetano Filangieri wrote a Scienza della Legislazione. Cesare Beccaria, in his treatise Dei Delitti e delle Pene, made a contribution to the reform of the penal system and promoted the abolition of torture.

The man in whom above all others the literary revival of the 18th century was most conspicuously embodied was Giuseppe Parini. He was born in a Lombard village in 1729, was mostly educated at Milan, and as a youth was known among the Arcadian poets by the name of Darisbo Elidonio. Even as an Arcadian, however, Parini showed signs of departing from the common type. In a collection of poems that he published at twenty-three years of age, under the name of Ripano Eupilino, there are some pastoral sonnets in which the poet shows that he had the faculty of taking his scenes from real life, and also some satirical pieces in which he exhibits a spirit of somewhat rude opposition to his own times. These poems are perhaps based on reminiscences of Berni, but at any rate they indicate a resolute determination to assail boldly all the literary conventionalities that surrounded the author. This, however, was only the beginning of the battle. Parini lived in times of great social prostration. The nobles and the rich, all given up to ease and to silly gallantry, consumed their lives in ridiculous trifles or in shameless self-indulgence, wasting themselves on immoral “Cicisbeismo,” and offering the most miserable spectacle of feebleness of mind and character. It was against this social condition that Parini’s muse was directed. Already, improving on the poems of his youth, he had proved himself an innovator in his lyrics, rejecting at once Petrarchism, Secentismo, and Arcadia, the three maladies that had weakened Italian art in the centuries preceding his own, and choosing subjects taken from real life, such as might help in the instruction of his contemporaries. In the Odi the satirical note is already heard. But it came out more strongly in the poem Del Giorno, in which he imagines himself to be teaching a young Milanese patrician all the habits and ways of gallant life; he shows up all its ridiculous frivolities, and with delicate irony unmasks the futilities of aristocratic habits. Dividing the day into four parts, the Mattino, the Mezzogiorno, the Vespero, the Notte, by means of each of these he describes the trifles of which they were made up, and the book thus assumes a social and historical value of the highest importance. Parini, satirizing his time, fell back upon truth, and finally made art serve the purpose of civil morality. As an artist, going straight back to classical forms, aspiring to imitate Virgil and Dante, he opened the way to the fine school that we shall soon see rise, that of Alfieri, Foscolo, and Monti. As a work of art, the Giorno is wonderful for the Socratic skill with which that delicate irony is constantly kept up by which he seems to praise what he effectually blames. The verse has new harmonies; sometimes it is a little hard and broken, not by accident, but as a protest against the Arcadian monotony. Generally it flows majestically, but without that Frugonian droning that deafens the ears and leaves the heart cold.

Gasparo Gozzi’s satire was less elevated, but directed towards the same end as Parini’s. In his Osservatore, something like Addison’s Spectator, in his Gazzetta Veneta, in the Mondo Morale, by means of allegories and novelties he hit the vices with a delicate touch, and inculcated a practical moral with much good sense. Gozzi’s satire has some slight resemblance in style to Lucian’s. It is smooth and light, but withal it does not go less straight to its aim, which is to point out the defects of society and to correct them. Gozzi’s prose is very graceful and lively. It only errs by its overweening affectation of imitating the writers of the 14th century. Another satirical writer of the first half of the 18th century was Giuseppe Baretti of Turin. In a journal called the Frusta Letteraria he took to lashing [9:13:513] without mercy the works which were then being published in Italy. He had learnt much by travelling; and especially his long stay in England had contributed to give an independent character to his mind, and made him judge of men and things with much good sense. It is true that his judgments are not always right, but the Frusta Letteraria was the first book of independent criticism, directed particularly against the Arcadians and the pedants.

Everything tended to improvement, and the character of the reform was to throw off the conventional, the false, the artificial, and to return to truth. The drama felt this influence of the times. Apostolo Zeno and Metastasio (the Arcadian name for Pietro Trapassi, a native of Rome) had endeavoured to make “melodrama and reason compatible.” The latter in particular succeeded in giving fresh expression to the affections, a natural turn to the dialogue, and some interest to the plot; and if he had not fallen into constant unnatural over-refinement and unseasonable mawkishness, and into frequent anachronisms, he might have been considered as the first dramatic reformer of the 18th century. That honour belongs to Carlo Goldoni, a Venetian. He found comedy either entirely devoted to classical imitation, or given up to extravagance, to coups de théâtre, to the most boisterous succession of unlikely situations, or else treated by comic actors who recited impromptu on a given subject, of which they followed the outline. In this old popular form of comedy, with the masks of pantaloon, of the doctor, of harlequin, of Brighella, &c., Goldoni found the strongest obstacles to his reform. But at last he conquered, creating the comedy of character. No doubt Molière’s example helped him in this. Goldoni’s characters are always true, but often a little superficial. He studied nature, but he did not plunge into psychological depths. In most of his creations, the external rather than the internal part is depicted. In this respect he is much inferior to Molière. But on the other hand he surpasses him in the liveliness of the dialogue, and in the facility with which he finds his dramatic situations. Goldoni wrote much, in fact too much (more than one hundred and fifty comedies), and had no time to correct, to polish, to perfect his works, which are all rough cast. But for a comedy of character we must go straight from Machiavelli’s Mandragora to him. Goldoni’s dramatic aptitude is curiously illustrated by the fact that he took nearly all his types from Venetian society, and yet managed to give them an inexhaustible variety. A good many of his comedies were written in Venetian dialect, and these are perhaps the best.

The ideas that were making their way in French society in the 18th century, and afterwards brought about the Revolution of 1789, gave a special direction to Italian literature of the second half of the 18th century. Love of ideal liberty, desire for equality, hatred of tyranny, created in Italy a literature which aimed at national objects, seeking to improve the condition of the country by freeing it from the double yoke of political and religious despotism. But all this was associated with another tendency. The Italians who aspired to a political redemption believed that it was inseparable from an intellectual revival, and it seemed to them that this could only be effected by a reunion with ancient classicism,—in other words, by putting themselves in more direct communication with ancient Greek and Latin writers. This was a repetition of what had occurred in the first half of the 15th century. The 17th century might in fact be considered as a new Italian Middle Age without the hardness of that iron time, but corrupted, enervated, overrun by Spaniards and French, an age in which previous civilization was cancelled. A reaction was necessary against that period of history, and a construction on its ruins of a new country and a new civilization. There had already been forerunners of this movement; at the head of them the revered Parini. Now the work must be completed, and the necessary force must once more be sought for in the ancient literature of the two classic nations. Patriotism and classicism then were the two principles that inspired the literature which began with Alfieri. He worshipped the Greek and Roman idea of popular liberty in arms against the tyrant. He took the subjects of his tragedies almost invariably from the history of these nations, made continual apostrophes against the despots, made his ancient characters talk like revolutionists of his time; he did not trouble himself with, nor think about, the truth of the characters; it was enough for him that his hero was Roman in name, that there was a tyrant to be killed, that liberty should triumph in the end. But even this did not satisfy Alfieri. Before his time and all about him there was the Arcadian-school, with its foolish verbosity, its empty abundance of epithets, its nauseous pastoralizing on subjects of no civil importance. It was necessary to arm the patriotic muse also against all this. If the Arcadians, not excluding the hated Metastasio, diluted their poetry with languishing tenderness, if they poured themselves out in so many words, if they made such set phrases, it behoved the others to do just the contrary, to be brief, concise, strong, bitter, to aim at the sublime as opposed to the lowly and pastoral. Having said this, we have told the good and evil of Alfieri. He desired a political reform by means of letters: he saved literature from Arcàdian vacuities, leading it towards a national end; he armed himself with patriotism and classicism in order to drive the profaners out of the temple of art. But in substance he was rather a patriot than an artist. In any case the results of the new literary movement were copious.

Ugo Foscolo was an eager patriot, who carried into life the heat of the most unbridled passion, and into his art a rather rhetorical manner, but always one inspired by classical models. His life was a most exciting one: he was a soldier with General Massena, a professor of eloquence at the university of Pavia, an exile after 1815. Three strong passions were always united in him—a passion for Italy, for art, and for beautiful women. Foscolo was born at Zante, and took pride in being a Greek. He translated some books of the Iliad, and the Coma Berenices of Catullus. He studied classical authors widely, and in his original works the reflexion of them is perceptible. The Lettere di Jacopo Ortis, inspired by Goethe’s Werther, are a love story with a mixture of patriotism; they contain a violent protest against the treaty of Campo Formio, and an outburst from Foscolo’s own heart about an unhappy love-affair of his. His passions were sudden and violent; they came to an end as abruptly as they began; they were whirlwinds that were over in a quarter of an hour. To one of these passions Ortis owed its origin, and it is perhaps the best, the most sincere, of all his writings. Even in it he is sometimes pompous and rhetorical, but much less so than he is, for example, in the lectures DeW Origine e dell ’ Uffιcio della Letteratura. On the whole, Foscolo’s prose is turgid and affected, and reflects the character of the man who always tried to pose, even before himself, in dramatic attitudes. This was indeed the defect of the Napoleonic epoch; there was a horror of anything common, simple, natural; everything must be after the model of the hero who made all the world gaze with wonder at him; everything must assume some heroic shape. In Foscolo this tendency was excessive; and it not seldom happened that, in wishing to play the hero, the exceptional man, the little Napoleon of ladies’ drawing-rooms, he became false and bad, false in his art, bad in his life. The Sepolcri, which is his best poem, was prompted by high [9:13:514] feeling, and the mastery of versification shows wonderful art. Perhaps it is to this mastery more than to anything else that the admiration the Sepolcri excites is due. There are most obscure p ιssages in it, as to the meaning of which it would seem as if even the author himself had not formed a clear idea. He left incomplete three hymns to the Graces, in which he sang of beauty as the source of courtesy, of all high qualities, and of happiness. Here again what most excites our admiration is the harmonious and easy versification, Among his prose works a high place belongs to his translation of the Sentimental Journey of Sterne, a writer by whom one can easily understand how Foscolo should have been deeply affected. He went as an exile to England, and died there. He wrote for English readers some Essays on Petrarch and on the texts of the Decamerone and of Dante, which are remarkable for the time at which they were written, and which may be said to have initiated a new kind of literary criticism in Italy. Foscolo is still greatly admired, and not without reason. His writings stimulate the love of fatherland, and the men that made the revolution of 1848 were largely brought up on them. Still, his fame both as a man and as an artist is now on the decline.

If in Foscolo patriotism and classicism were united, and formed almost one passion, so much cannot be said of Vincenzo Monti, in whom the artist was absolutely predominant. Yet we must be careful: .Monti was a patriot too, but in his own way. He had no one deep feeling that ruled him, or rather the mobility of his feelings is his characteristic; but each of these was a new form of patriotism, that took the place of an old one. He saw danger to his country in the French Revolution, and wrote the Pellegrino Aρostolico, the Bassvilliana, and the Feroniade∙, Napoleon’s victories caused him to write the Prometeo and the Musagonia ; in his Fanatisme) and his Superstizione he attacked the papacy; afterwards he sang the praises of tho Austrians. Thus every great event made him change his mind, with a readiness which might seem incredible, but is yet most easily explained. Monti was above everything an artist; art was his real, his only passion; everything else in him was liable to change, that alone was persistent. Fancy was his tyrant, and under its rule he had no time to reason and to see the miserable aspect of his political tergiversation. It was an overbearing deity that moved him, and at its dictation he wrote. Pius VI., Napoleon, Francis II., were to him but passing shadows, to which he hardly gives the attention of an hour; that which endures, which is eternal to him, is art alone. It were unjust to accuse Monti of baseness. If we say that nature in giving him one only faculty had made the poet rich and the man poor, we shall speak the truth. But the poet was indeed rich. Knowing little Greek, he succeeded in making a translation of the Iliad which is remarkable for its Homeric feeling, and in his Bassvilliana he is on a level with Dante. In fine, in him classical poetry seemed to revive in all its florid grandeur.

Monti was born in 1754, Foscolo in 1778; four years later still was born another poet of the same school, Giambattista Niccolini. In literature he was'a classicist; in politics he was a Ghibelline, a rare exception in Guelph Florence, his birthplace. In translating or, if the expression is preferred, imitating Aeschylus, as well as in writing the Discorsi sulla Tragedia Greca, and on the Sublime e Michelangelo, Niccolini displayed his passionate devotion to ancient literature. In his tragedies he set himself free from the excessive rigidity of Altieri, and partly approached the English and German tragic authors. He nearly always chose political subjects, striving to keep alive in his compatriots the love of liberty. Such are Nabucco, Antonio Foscarini, Giovanni da Procida, Lodovico il Moro, &c. He assailed papal Rome in Arnaldo da Brescia, a long tragic piece, not suited for acting, and epic rather than dramatic. Niccolini’s tragedies show a rich lyric vein rather than dramatic genius. At any rate he has the merit of having vindicated liberal ideas, and of having opened a new path to Italian tragedy.

The literary period we are dealing with had three writers who are examples of the direction taken by historical study. It seems strange that, after the learned school begun by Muratori, there should have been a backward movement here, but it is clear that this retrogression was due to the influence of classicism and patriotism, which, if they revived poetry, could not but spoil history. Carlo Botta, born in 1766, was a spectator of French spoliation in Italy and of the overbearing rule of Napoleon. Hence, excited by indignation, he wrote a History of Italy from 1789 to 1814; and later on he continued Guicciardini’s History up to 1789. He wrote after the manner of the Latin authors, trying to imitate Livy, putting together long and sonorous periods in a style that aimed at being like Boccaccio’s, caring little about that which constitutes the critical material of history, only intent on declaiming his academic prose for his country’s benefit. Botta wanted to be classical in a style that could no longer be so, and hence he failed completely to attain his literary goal. His fame is only that of a man of a noble and patriotic heart. Not so bad as the two histories of Italy is that of the Guerra dell' lndipendenza Americana.

Close to Botta comes Pietro Colletta, a Neapolitan born nine years after him. He also in his Stoma del Beame di Napoli dal 1734 αl 1825 had the idea of defending the independence and liberty of Italy in a style borrowed from Tacitus; and he succeeded rather better than Botta. He has a rapid, brief, nervous style, which makes his book attractive reading. But it is said that Pietro Giordani and Gino Capponi corrected it for him. Lazzaro Papi of Lucca, author of the Commentam della Rivoluzione Francese dal 1789 al 1814, was not altogether unlike Botta and Colletta. He also was an historian in the classical style, and treats his subject with patriotic feeling; but as an artist he perhaps excels the other two.

At first sight it seems unnatural that, whilst the most burning political passions were raging, and whilst the most brilliant men of genius in the new classical and patriotic school were at the height of their influence, a question should have arisen about “purism” of language. Yet the phenomenon can be easily accounted for. Purism is another form of classicism and patriotism. In the second half of the 18th century the Italian language was specially full of French expressions. There was great indifference about fitness, still more about elegance of style. Prose then was to be restored for the sake of national dignity, and it was believed that this could not be done except by going back to the writers of the 14th century, to the “aurei trecentisti,” as they were called, or else to the classics of Italian literature. One of the promoters of the new school was Antonio Cesari of Verona, who republished ancient authors, and brought out a new edition, with additions, of the Vocabolamo della Crusca. He wrote a dissertation Sopra lo stato presente della Lingua Italiana, and endeavoured to establish the supremacy of Tuscan and of the three great writers Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio. And in accordance with that principle he wrote several books, taking pains to copy the “trecentisti” as closely as possible. But patriotism in Italy has always had something municipal in it; so to this Tuscan supremacy, proclaimed and upheld by Cesari, there was opposed a Lombard school, which would know nothing of Tuscan, and with Dante’s De Vulgari Eloquio returned to the idea of the “lingua illustre.” This was an old question, largely and bitterly argued in the Cinquecento (16th century) by Varchi, [9:13:515] Muzio, Castelvetro, Speroni, and others. Now the question came up again quite fresh, as if no one had ever discussed it before. At the head of the Lombard school were Monti and his son-in-law Count Giulio Perticari. This gave Monti an occasion to write Proposta di αlcune Corre-zioni ed Aggiuηte al Vocabolarw della Crusca, in which he attacked the Tuscanisnι of the Crusca, but in a graceful and easy style, such in fact as to form a prose that is one of the most beautiful in Italian literature. Perticari on the other hand, with a very inferior intellect, narrowed and exasperated the question in two treatises Degli Scrittori del Trecento and Dell’ Amor Patrio di Dante, in which, often disguising or altering the facts, he only makes confusion where there was none. Meantime, however, the impulse was given. The dispute about language took its place beside literary and political disputes, and all Italy took part in it,—Basilio Puoti at Naples, Paolo Costa in the Romagna, Marc’ Antonio Parenti at Modena, Salvatore Betti at Rome, Giovanni Gherardini in Lombardy, Luigi Fornaciari at Lucca, Vincenzo Nairnucci at Florence.

A patriot, a classicist, and a purist all at once was Pietro Giordani, born in 1774; he was almost a compendium of the literary movement of the time. His whole life was a battle fought for liberty. Most learned in Greek and Latin authors, and in the Italian trecentisti, he only left a few writings behind him, but they were carefully elaborated in point of style, and his prose was in his time considered wonderful. Now it is looked on as too majestic, too much laboured in phrases and conceits, too far from nature, too artificial. Giordani closes the literary epoch of the classicists.

7. Contemporary Period.— At this point the contemporary period of literature begins. It has been said that the first impulse was given to it by the romantic school, which had as its organ the Conciliatore established in 1818 at Milan, and on the staff of which were Silvio Pellico, Lodovico di Breme, Giovile Scalvini, Tommaso Grossi, Giovanni Berchet, Samuele Biava, and lastly Alessandro Manzoni. It need not be denied that all these men were influenced by the ideas that, especially in Germany, at the beginning of the 19th century constituted the movement called Romanticism. Nevertheless in Italy the course of literary reform took another direction. There is no doubt that the real head of the reform, or at least its most distinguished man, was Alessandro Manzoni. He formulated in a letter of his the objects of the new school, saying that it aspired to try and discover and express “il vero storico” and “il vero morale,” not only as an end, but as the widest and eternal source of the beautiful. And it is precisely realism in art that characterizes Italian literature from Manzoni onwards. The Promessi Sposi is the one of his works that has made him immortal. No doubt the idea of the historical novel came to him from Sir Walter Scott, but he succeeded in something more than an historical novel in the narrow meaning of that word; he created an eminently realistic work of art. The romance disappears; no one cares for the plot, which moreover is of very little consequence. The attention is entirely fixed on the powerful objective creation of the characters. From the greatest to the least they have a wonderful verisimilitude; they are living persons standing before us, not with the qualities of one time more than another, but with the human qualities of all time. Manzoni is able to unfold a character in all particulars, to display it in all its aspects, to follow it through its different phases. He is able also to seize one moment, and from that moment to make us guess all the rest. Don Abbondio and Renzo are as perfect as Azzeccagarbugli and II Sarto. Manzoni dives down into the innermost recesses of the human heart, and draws thence the most subtle psychological reality. In this his greatness lies, which was recognized first by his companion in genius, Goethe. With the exception of the Promessi Sposi, his works are important for the history of the author’s mind, not for the history of literature. Some of them are rather in contrast to that masterpiece. It is chiefly the Inηi Sac ∣ i and the two tragedies that explain why Manzoni became the head of the school of Romanticism. It is not to be denied that even as a poet he had gleams of genius, especially where he describes human affections, as in some stanzas of the Irini and in the chorus of the Adelchi. But it is the Promessi Sposi alone that places him at the head of the Italian literature of the 19th century, on account of the artistic realism prevailing in it. But Manzoni shared this glory with another writer, Giacomo Leopardi. It may seem absurd, but still it is the case, that the mystic, the religious Manzoni, has his place side by side with the poet of atheism and despair: they are indissolubly bound together for all time by an artistic intention, identical although realized by different means. Leopardi was born thirteen years after Manzoni at Recanati, of a patrician family, bigoted and avaricious, and he almost entirely educated himself. His body was deformed, and he was of a sickly habit, so that in the years that bring cheerfulness and laughter to youths and children he shut himself up in his father’s library and studied. He became so familiar with Greek authors that he used afterwards to say that the Greek mode of thought was more clear and living to his mind than the Latin or even the Italian. Solitude, sickness, domestic tyranny, prepared him for profound melancholy. From this he passed into complete religious scepticism. He sought rest in art, and first wrote a Canzone all' Italia and another for the monument of Dante Alighieri (1818), both full of classical and patriotic feeling. They show that for the time, though only for the time, he was of the school of Alfieri, Foscolo, and the others we have spoken of. His love of classicism always continued, but he changed its subject. He passed on into the poetry of sentiment and nature, describing with an unsurpassable realism what he felt and saw. The Passero solitario, the Quiete dopo la Tempesta, the Sabato del Villaggio, are pictures in which objective realism reaches its highest ideality; whilst beside them there are the Ultimo Canto di Saffo, the Picordanze, the Genestra, and other poems, in which is poured out all the sorrow that weighs on the unhappy man to whom nature has denied every joy and every happiness. Everything is terrible and grand in these poems, which are the most agonizing cry in modern literature, uttered with a solemn quietness that at once elevates and terrifies us. The poetry of despair never had a more powerful or a more sorrowful voice than this. In this Leopardi surpasses even Byron and Shelley. But, besides being the greatest poet of nature and of sorrow, he was also an excellent prose writer. In his Operette Morali — dialogues and discourses marked by a cold and bitter smile at human destinies which freezes the reader—the clearness of style, the simplicity of language, and the depth of conception are such that perhaps he is not only the first poet since Dante, but also the most perfect writer of prose that Italian literature has had.

As realism in art gained ground, the positive method in criticism kept pace with it. From the manner of Botta and Colletta history returned to its spirit of learned research, as is shown in such works as the Archivio Storico Italiano, established at Florence by Giampietro Vieusseux, the Storia d'Italia nel Medio Evo by Carlo Troya, a remarkable treatise by Manzoni himself, Sopra alcuni Punti della storia Longobardica iιι. Italia, and the very fine history of the Vespri Siciliaηi by Michele Amari. The same positive method is now being applied to literary history.

But alongside of the great artists Leopardi and Manzoni, [9:13:516] Index. alongside of the learned scholars, there was also in the first half of the 19th century a patriotic literature. To a close observer it will appear that historical learning itself was inspired by the love of Italy. It is well known what Vieusseux’s intentions were when he established the Antologia, in which work all Italian liberals took part, and which was suppressed by the action of the Russian Government. And it is equally well known that the Archiv™ Storico Italiano was, under a different form, a continuation of the Antologia. Florence was in those days the asylum of all the Italian exiles, and these exiles met and shook hands in Vieusseux’s rooms, where there was more literary than political talk, but where one thought and one only animated all minds, the thought of Italy.

The literary movement which preceded and was contemporary with the political revolution of 1848 may be said to be represented by four writers,— Giuseppe Giusti, Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, Vincenzo Gioberti, and Cesare Balbo. Giusti wrote epigrammatic satires in popular language. In incisive phrase he scourged the enemies of Italy; his manner seemed very original, but it really was partly imitated from Beranger. He was a telling political writer, but a mediocre poet,—too much a poet of occasion. Few of his verses will survive as works of art. Guerrazzi had a great reputation and great influence; he was the author of historical novels written with a political object, such as the Assedio di Firenze, the Battaglia di Benevento, &c. Read with feverish avidity before 1848, these books of his are now almost forgotten. They struck the·imagination then by their style, which is partly affected and partly spasmodic. They seemed to be sublime, but were little less than ridiculous. Gioberti had a noble heart and a great mind; his philosophical works are already as good as dead, but the Primato morale e civile degli Italiani will last as an important document of the times. It is a book false in substance, but inspired by lofty sentiments, and it is written in an easy and eloquent style, although sometimes a little verbose. The Gesuita moderno will live as the most tremendous indictment ever written against the Jesuits. Gioberti was a powerful polemical writer; and in polemics he showed his most original and characteristic qualities. Balbo was an earnest student of history, and made history useful for politics. Like Gioberti in his first period, Balbo was zealous for the civil papacy, and for a federation of the Italian states presided over by it. His Sommario della Storia TItalia is the best epitome that exists of the intricate history of Italy. In the Pensieri sullα Storia d , Italia he touched on important subjects, which still await treatment. He did not do himself justice in the Meditazioni Storiche, a work on the philosophy of history, for which he had not the necessary qualifications.

It is not advisable to speak of living authors. We shall only notice the fact that the political revival in Italy seems to have brought forth good fruit also in the fields of literature. It appears that the literary bent of the present day is towards historical research. Of the poets, only one, Giosuè Carducci, has as yet acquired a reputation that seems certain to last.
