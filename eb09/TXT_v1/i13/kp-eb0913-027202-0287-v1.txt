IRELAND, Samuel William Henry (1777-1835), generally known as William Henry Ireland, who at the age of seventeen produced the notorious Shakespeare forgeries, was the son of the subject of last notice, and was born in London in 1777. After spending four years at school in France, he was apprenticed in 1794 to a conveyancer in London. The enthusiasm of his father for everything connected with Shakespeare suggested to young Ireland the idea of delighting him with a forged autograph of the poet. He carefully drew up a copy of an old deed, purporting to be a lease from Shakespeare to certain other parties, and presented it as a genuine document to his unsuspecting father. The complete success of this first attempt and the eager solicitations of his friends to ransack the papers among which he pretended to have found the lease were the incitements to a more ambitious career of literary forgery. He invented a story of a gentleman, accidentally met with, among whose old papers the documents were found, but who, for various reasons, refused to permit his name to be disclosed. A large collection of the most interesting relics was brought to light. A profession of faith, a love-letter, enclosing a lock of the poet’s hair, to Anne Hathaway, private letters to and from Shakespeare, theatrical memoranda, notes of hand and receipts, agreements between Shakespeare and actors, pictures, annotated [9:13:273] books and tracts—all were produced and received with delighted credulity. Dr Parr, Dr Wharton, Sir Isaac Heard, James Boswell, and others came to register their belief in the authenticity of the papers. The assurance with which the imposture was conducted may be judged from the fact that a deed was brought forward, in which it was set forth that the papers and books had been bequeathed by Shakespeare to a certain contemporary William-Henrye Irelaunde, who had rescued him from drowning in the Thames, and who, there was evidence to show, was the direct ancestor of the Ireland whom chance had thrown in the way of the possessor of the relics. At last a whole new play, named Vortigern, was announced as having been discovered. Sheridan purchased it for Drury Lane Theatre, and an overflowing house assembled to sit in judgment upon it. But away from the glamour of crabbed handwriting and yellow paper, the feeble dialogue and crude conceptions of the tragedy could not stand the test, and one representation sufficed to prove it a complete failure. Its fate prevented the composition of a series of historical plays, of which Henry II. had already been produced by the impudent Ireland. Samuel Ireland the elder had published the miscellaneous papers in what he asserts to have been the fullest belief in their authenticity, but the hostile criticism of Malone and others, and the unsatisfactory account of the source of the papers, combined to compel him to demand a full disclosure from his son. Harassed by the success of his own deceit, which had carried him far beyond his first intention, Ireland at last confessed his fraud, and published a tract with a full account in 1796. In 1805 he published more elaborate Confessions, in which he cannot conceal his satisfied vanity. After the exposure, Ireland was forced to abandon both his home and his profession. He wrote several novels of no value, and gradually sank to the condition of a bookseller’s hack. He died in great penury in April 1835.

The more interesting publications on the Ireland forgeries are :— Inquiry into the authenticity of certain Papers, &c., attributed to Shakespeare, by Edmond Malone, 1796; An Apology for the Believers in the Shakespeare Papers, 1797, and a Supplemental Apology, 1799, both by George Chalmers; and pamphlets by Boaden, Waldron, Wyatt, Webb, and Oulton. Vortigern was republished in 1832.
