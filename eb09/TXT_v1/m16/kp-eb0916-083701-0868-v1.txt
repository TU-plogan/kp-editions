MORPETH, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Northumberland, England, is situated in a fine valley on the Wansbeck, and on the North-Eastern Railway, 50 miles south of Berwick and 16 north of Newcastle. The Wansbeck, which is crossed by a stone and two wooden bridges, winds round the town on the west, south, and east, and a small rivulet, the Cottingburn, bounds it on the north. Morpeth is irregularly built, but possesses a number of good shops. The parish church of the Blessed Virgin, a plain building of the 14th century, is situated on Kirk Hill, a short distance from the town. Among the other public buildings are the Edward VI.’s grammar school, reopened in 1857 after a Chancery suit lasting 150 years; the townhall, erected in 1870 to supersede a building of 1714 by Vanbrugh; and the county-hall and former gaol, in the baronial style, built in 1814. Nothing remains of the old castle except the gateway. Morpeth had at one time one of the largest cattle-markets in England. The industries of the town include tanning, brewing, malting, iron and brass founding, and the manufacture of flannels, agricultural implements, and bricks and tiles. The population of the municipal borough (231 acres) in 1871 was 4517, and in 1881 it was 4556. The population of the parliamentary borough (17,085 acres) in the same years was 30,239 and 33,459.

Morpeth {Morepath, i,e., the path over the moor) had attained some size before the Norman Conquest, when it was granted to William de Merlay. From the De Merlays it passed through the Greystocks and Dacres to the Howards, earls of Carlisle. Soon after the Conquest it obtained the privilege of a market, and in 1552 arms were granted to it by Edward VI. It is a borough by prescription, and was incorporated by Charles II. By the Municipal Act of 1835 the government was placed in a mayor and burgesses, but there is a local board of health distinct from the corporation, having control over an area slightly larger than that of the municipal borough. From 1553 the borough sent two members to parliament, but since 1832 only one member has been returned, and in 1868 the area of the borough was increased.
