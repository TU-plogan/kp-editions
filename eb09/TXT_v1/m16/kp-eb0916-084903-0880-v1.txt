MORTON, James Douglas, fourth earl of (1530-1581), regent of Scotland, second son of Sir George Douglas of Pittendriech, was born at Dalkeith in 1530. Having married Elizabeth, daughter of the third earl of Morton, he through her succeeded in 1553 to the title and estates of his father-in-law. After the return of Queen Mary in 1561 he was chosen a privy councillor, and in 1563 he became lord high chancellor. Though his sympathies were Protestant, he took no part in the combination of Protestant barons in 1565, but he headed the armed force of 150 men who took possession of Holyrood Palace to effect the assassination of Rizzio, and it was to his house that the leading conspirators adjourned while a messenger was sent to obtain Mary’s signature to the “bond of security.” The queen, before complying with the request, escaped to Dunbar, and on her return to Edinburgh with an escort of 2000 men Morton and the other leaders fled to England. After her marriage with Bothwell, Morton returned, and with 600 men appeared before Borthwick Castle, where the queen, in dread of a rising, had taken refuge. He was present at the remarkable conference at Carberry Hill, and he also took an active part in obtaining the consent of the queen at Lochleven to an abdication. Thereupon he was reappointed lord high chancellor, and also succeeded Bothwell as lord high admiral. On the death of the earl of Mar he became regent (October 1572). Through his persistence in recovering the crown jewels from the countess of Argyll, widow of the earl of Moray, Morton awakened the bitter animosity of Argyll and Athole, who persuaded the young king James VI. to assume the government. Morton deemed it prudent to resign, and for a time retired to Lochleven, but shortly afterwards, with the assistance of his nephew, the earl of Mar, he obtained possession of Stirling Castle, where the king was residing, and thus for a time recovered his old influence. Suddenly, however, he was accused by James Stewart, earl of Arran, of having taken part in the murder of Darnley, the father of the king, and being tried by a jury of sixteen peers, most of whom were his enemies, was condemned to death and beheaded on 2d June 1581.
