MORNY, Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, Due de (1811-1865), was the natural son of Hortense Beauharnais, queen of Holland, and of the comte de Flahaut, a leading dandy of the period, and was thus brother to Napoleon III. The secret of his birth (23d October 1811) was carefully kept; he was acknowledged as son by the comte de Morny for a consideration, and was brought up by his paternal grandmother, Madame de Souza, a writer of society novels, and a woman of great wit and high breeding. As a boy of nineteen he was declared after the revolution of 1830 a hero of July, and was entered at the staff college. In 1832 he was gazetted sub-lieutenant, and served in Algeria as aide-de-camp to General Oudinot; he was present at Mascara and Constantine, and was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. In 1838 he returned to Paris, and began his career as dandy and speculator. In the first capacity he set the fashions both of dress and manners to the young men of Paris, and conceived the idea of the modern society journal, and in the second established a manufactory of beetroot sugar at Clermont-Ferrand. This last idea brought about his election for the department of the Puy-de-Dôme. In the chamber he voted consistently with the ministers. The republic of 1848 marked the crisis in his fortunes, and by 1851 all his speculations had failed, and all his property was sold. In desperation he determined to play a part in politics, and was the heart and soul of the coup d’état of December 1851. The success of the coup d’état was certain, owing to the fear of the extreme republicans entertained by the great majority of the nation, and all that was needed was a head for intrigue and an utter absence of scruples to shed innocent blood. Morny and St Arnaud fulfilled these requisites. Morny was on the day of the coup J état made minister of the interior, but he had no taste for the drudgery of administration, and in January 1852 found an excuse for resigning on the question of the property of the Orleanist princes. The empire established, he was again able to begin speculating, and used both the money of the state and his influence with his brother for the success of his schemes. He had been in 1852 re-elected deputy for Clermont-Ferrand, and was in 1854 elected president of the corps legislatif, an office which he held for the rest of his life. This office in every way suited him; he had large pay, and resided in a magnificent official residence, where he produced little plays to admiring audiences. The work was not hard, being chiefly to maintain the Government majority in a good humour by sumptuous entertainments, and to win over the Liberals by the same tactics. He still speculated in railways, pictures, mines, and even in a new watering-place, Deauville, and, being absolutely unscrupulous and venal, amassed an immense fortune in spite of the utmost extravagance. In 1856 he was special ambassador at the coronation of Czar Alexander II., when he spent immense sums, and married a wealthy Russian, Princess Troubetzkoy. In 1862 he was created a duke, and in 1865, after continuing to the last his career of dissipation, died of sheer anaemia from the measures he took to keep himself fit for yet further excesses.

Of the due de Morny little good can be said either as a statesman or a man. He looked upon everything from a purely selfish point [9:16:830] of view, and would not have denied it; but he was shrewd enough to perceive that the empire rested on the prestige it maintained for France not only in war but in fashion, ana in assisting the empress to make Paris the centre of fashion for the whole civilized world he knew he was not only pleasing himself but doing a service to the empire. He was a thorough man of the world, and was witty as such, but the wit does not appear at its brightest in his plays, published under the name of Saint-Remy, of which perhaps the most readable is Μ. Choufleury restera chez lui. He had great influence over the emperor, but could lay no claim to personal fidelity, as could his less able but equally unscrupulous colleague, Μ. de Persigny.

. For his life consult H. Castille, Μ. de Momy, 1859, and De la Gueronnière, Etudes et portraits politiques (1856); also Alton-Shee’s Mémoires (1868-69). His character is admirably sketched as the due de Mora in A. Daudet’s novel Le Nabab.
