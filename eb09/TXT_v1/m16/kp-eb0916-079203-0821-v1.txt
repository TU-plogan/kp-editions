MONTPELLIER, chief town of the department of Hérault, France, is situated at the junction of several railway lines, on a small hill rising above the Lez l at its confluence with the Merdanson, about 480 miles south of Paris, and about 7 miles from the Mediterranean, from which it is separated by the lagoons of Pérols and 1’Arnel. As the headquarters of the 16th corps d’armée, as the seat of a bishop, of a university, and of a court of appeal, Montpellier is the principal place of lower Languedoc. The Place du Peyrou, 575 feet in length by 410 in breadth, one of the finest squares in France, occupies the highest part of the town, and terminates in a terrace, commanding a magnificent view of the coasts of the Mediterranean, and of a wide stretch of country reaching to the Cevennes on the north, to the spurs of the Pyrenees on the south-west, and to those of the Alps on the north-east. On the terrace is situated the reservoir of the town, the water being brought from a distance of 5 or 6 miles by an aqueduct of two tiers of arches, about 70 feet in height. In the centre of the square is an equestrian statue of Louis XIV. To the right and left are promenades, on which the chief boulevards converge. The Boulevard Henri IV. to the north leads to the botanical garden, medical college, and cathedral; to the east the Rue Nationale leads to the palace of justice, the préfecture, and the citadel. The cathedral, which until 1536 was the church of a Benedictine monastery, suffered severely during the religious wars, but about thirty years ago it was restored in the style of the 13th century. It has four towers, and is one of the largest churches in southern France, being more than 300 feet in length, 92 in breadth, and 88 in height. The monastery, after being converted into the bishop’s palace, has since 1795 being occupied by the famous medical school. The portrait of Rabelais hangs in the gallery of former professors. Connected with the medical school is an anatomical museum and a rich library. Montpellier also possesses a faculty of science, with several fine collections, a faculty of letters, a higher school of pharmacy, an agricultural college, and a sericultural institute. The museum contains more than 600 paintings, in addition to collections of marbles, bronzes, and antiquities. The botanical garden, more than 10 acres in extent, is the oldest in France, having been laid out in 1593. The esplanade, ornamented by fine old trees planted by the due de Roquelaure, formerly governor of Languedoc, leads towards the citadel. The inner city has narrow and tortuous streets, but many good houses. Among the public buildings, the principal are the palace of justice —a modern structure, the façade adorned with statues of the statesman Cambacérès and of Cardinal Fleury—the barracks, several hospitals, the juvenile seminary, and the central prison for females. There are several learned societies, including an academy of science and letters, an antiquarian society, several medical societies, and others for various separate branches of study, including the dialect of Languedoc. The Lez has been deepened and widened so as to connect Montpellier with the Canal du Midi and with the sea at Palavas. The town has a considerable trade in wine and brandy. The principal industrial establishment is a manufactory for wax-tapers, candles, and soap, doing business to the amount of £400,000 per annum. There are also chemical works, cooperages, distilleries, &c. The population in 1881 was 56,005.

Montpellier first rose into importance after the destruction of Maguelone by Charles Martel in 737. Its prosperity dates from the beginning of the 12th century, when its school of medicine (see vol. xv. p. 807) first began to acquire fame. It had a school of law in 1160, and a university was founded by Pope Nicholas IV. in 1292. St Louis (Louis IX.) granted to the town the right of free trade with the whole of the kingdom, a privilege which greatly increased its prosperity. In 1204 Montpellier became a dependency of the house of Aragon, through marriage, and in 1350 it was sold to Philip of Valois. In the time of Charles VIII. it is said to have had 35,000 hearths. It took the place of the bishopric of Maguelone in 1536. At the time of the Reformation it became one of the most important centres of Protestantism, but was taken by Louis XIII., who erected the citadel commanding the town. Several years afterwards Montpellier was partly depopulated by the plague. Of the old fortifications little now remains save the gate of Peyrou, a triumphal arch of date 1712, opposite the place of the same name.
