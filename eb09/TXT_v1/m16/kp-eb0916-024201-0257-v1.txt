MICKLE, William Julius (1734—1788), son of the minister of Langholm, Dumfriesshire, holds a respectable place among the imitative minor poets of the 18th century. He wrote a poem on Knowledge— carefully versified, pointing a moral on the vanity of intellectual pride— at the age of eighteen, entered into business as a brewer at his father’s request and against his own inclinations, soon became bankrupt, went to London on outlook for work as a man of letters, solicited patronage in vain, earned a living hardly by writing for magazines, made some impression in 1765 by “a poem in the manner of Spenser” called the Concubine (afterwards Syr Martyn), was appointed corrector to the Clarendon Press, and finally took a place among the leading poets of that very barren time by a translation of the Lusiad of Camoens into heroic couplets (specimen published 1771, whole work 1775). So great was the repute of the work that when Mickle— appointed secretary to Commodore Johnstone—visited Lisbon in 1779 the king of Portugal gave him a public reception. As a translator of Camoens Mickle has been superseded, but he aimed, not at close rendering of the original, but at making a poem which should be worthy of a permanent place in English literature. This ambition he was not capable of fulfilling, though he had great fluency and vigour. It may be doubted whether the fashionable forms which he imitated were the best suited to his natural gifts. He shows delight in lively action, a sense of dramatic effect, and, in the Concubine, the substance of which might have been conceived by Crabbe, considerable fulness of detail in coarse realistic painting. Certainly, if the Scottish poem There ’s nae luck aboot the hoose was Mickle’s, he mistook his medium. Scott read and admired Mickle’s poems in his youth, and, besides founding Kenilworth on the ballad of Cumnor Hall, was a good deal influenced by him in style. Mickle’s prose is lively and vigorous.
