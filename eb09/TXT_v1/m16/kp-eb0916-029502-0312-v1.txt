MILICZ, or Militsch, of Kremsier, Moravia, was the most influential among those preachers and writers in Moravia and Bohemia who during the 14th century paved the way for the reforming activity of Huss and through him for that of Luther. He was born about 1325, was already in holy orders in 1350, in 1360 was attached to the court of the emperor Charles IV., whom he accompanied into Germany in that year, and about the same time also held a canonry in the cathedral of Prague along with the dignity of archdeacon. About 1363 he resigned all his appointments that he might become a preacher pure and simple; he addressed scholars in Latin, and (an innovation) the laity in their native Czech, or in German, which he acquired for the purpose. The success of his labours in reclaiming the fallen made itself apparent in the reformation of a whole quarter of the city of Prague. As he dwelt more and more on ecclesiastical abuses and the corruption of the clergy, and viewed them in the light of Scripture, the conviction grew in his mind that the “abomination of desolation” was now seen in the temple of God, and that antichrist had come, and in 1367 he went to Rome (where Urban V. was expected from Avignon) to expound these views. He affixed to the gate of St Peter’s a placard announcing his sermon, but before he could deliver it was thrown into prison by the Inquisition. Urban, however, on his arrival ordered his release, whereupon he returned to Prague, and from 1369 to 1372 preached daily in the Teyn Church there. In the latter year the clergy of the diocese complained of him to the papal court at Avignon, whither he was summoned in Lent 137 4, and where he died before his case was decided. He was the author of a Libellus de Antichristo, written in prison at Rome, a series of Postillae and Lectiones Quadragesim,ales in Latin, and a similar series of Postils in Czech.
