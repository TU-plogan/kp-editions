MIDDELBURG, in Holland, the ancient capital of the province of Zealand, situated in the middle of the island of Walcheren, is mentioned as early as 1153, and receives the title “town” in a charter granted it in 1227. It has all the characteristics of an old and worn-out place. The population (25,000 in 1739) had sunk to 12,000 or 13,000 by the beginning of the 19th century, and has only begun recently to increase again, being 15,939 in 1882. The dwelling-houses, which in 1739 were about 3800, are now but 3000, and of these about 600 are unoccupied. The vast warehouses and imposing mansions once belonging to wealthy families, which have either died out or left the place, call up the memory of that prosperity which Middelburg enjoyed before its extensive trade, with the East and West Indies, with England and Flanders, was ruined by the war with England and the French occupation. By the opening of the railway (1872) and of the ship canal (1873) to Flushing Middelburg was lifted out of its isolation, and, with the assistance of the chamber of commerce, manufacturing industries (iron, machinery, furniture, oil, cigars, &c.) were established; but the prosperity anticipated for Flushing, and consequently for Middelburg, remains unrealized. One of the chief sights of Middelburg is the splendid town-house, for the most part erected in 1512-13, with its front gable adorned with twenty-five statues of counts and countesses of Holland and Zealand; it contains the archives, and a most valuable antiquarian and historical collection. The abbey, begun in 1150, has frequently been the residence of royal visitors (Maximilian, Philip the Fair, Charles V., and so on down to Napoleon I., and William I., II., and III.); part of it is now an hotel, and part of it is occupied by the provincial authorities. The great hall of the building, in which the states of Zealand assemble, is adorned with beautiful tapestries by Jan de Maecht, representing the heroic feats of the men of Zealand in the contest with Spain. What was formerly the nave of the abbey church is now the New Church, and the ancient choir constitutes the Choir Church. The former contains a fine pulpit resting on an eagle, the monument of William, king of the Romans (d. 1256), and the tombs of Jan and Cornelis Evertsen, two naval heroes who fell in the war against England in 1666; the latter has the monuments of the learned Hadrian Junius and of Jan Pieterszoon. The provincial court, the corn exchange, the Hof St Joris and the Hof St Sebastian (formerly buildings belonging to the guilds of archers, and now places of amusement) deserve mention. The great museum of Zealand antiquities, collected by the Zealand Society of Arts and Sciences (founded at Flushing in 1769 and transferred to Middelburg in 1801), shows that the town is the intellectual centre of the province.

The principal facts in the history of Middelburg are the sieges by the Flemings in 1288, 1296, and 1303 (the last resulting in the capture of the town by Guy of Dampierre); the recovery of the town from the Spaniards in 1574, after an investment of nearly two years; the frequent disturbances among the townsfolk in the 17th and 18th centuries; the surrender to the English in 1809; and the arrival and departure of the French in 1809 and 1814.
