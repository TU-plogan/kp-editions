MIDDLETOWN, a city and port of entry of the United States, and one of the shire towns of Middlesex county, Connecticut, lies on the right bank of the Connecticut river, about 30 miles from its mouth, directly opposite the well-known Portland quarries, and 24 miles from New Haven by rail. Built on ground rising gently from the river, with its principal streets keeping the direction of the valley, and the cross streets climbing the slope, Middletown is a place of considerable attractiveness, and the views from the higher points are particularly fine. Water Street, with the wharves and shipping, Main Street, with the commercial houses and hotels, and High Street, with its mansions and gardens and trees, are the leading lines of the city. On the high grounds behind stand the handsome buildings of the Wesleyan (Methodist Episcopal) University. The institution, mainly organized by Wilbur Fisk, D.D., was chartered in 1831. To the two buildings with which it started have been added Rich Hall, with the library of about 30,000 volumes, Judd Hall, with scientific collections of great value, the Memorial Chapel, erected in the centenary year of American Methodism, and the Observatory Hall. Since 1872 the courses of the university have been open to both sexes. In 1882 the number of professors was 20, and of students 191, including 14 females. The Berkeley Theological School (Main Street), founded by the Episcopal Church in 1854, had in 1882 7 professors and 41 students, with a library of 17,000 volumes. A hill 1∣ miles to the south-east of the city is occupied by the State General Hospital for the Insane, the principal building having a frontage of 768 feet, and the grounds extending to 230 acres; and on another hill to the southwest of the city stands the State industrial school for girls. As vessels drawing 10 feet of water can reach its wharves, Middletown carries on a considerable trade by the river. In 1882 1613 vessels, with a burden of 240,000 tons, entered the port, and 1613 vessels, with a burden of 350,000 tons, [9:16:284] cleared; and the Middletown district owned 83 sailing vessels and 22 steamers. Both the silver and the lead mines which were formerly worked in the vicinity have been abandoned, but cast-iron, britannia, and silver-plated goods, sewing-machines, pumps, webbing, and tape are among the local manufactures. The population of the city increased from 5182 in 1860 to 6850 in 1880. First settled in 1636, Middletown was incorporated as a town in 1654, and as a city in 1784.
