MIRABEAU, Victor Riqueti, Marquis de (1715- 1789), himself a distinguished author and political economist, but more famous as the father of the great Mirabeau, was born at Pertuis near the old chateau de Mirabeau on October 4, 1715. He was brought up very sternly by his father, and in 1729 joined the army. He took keenly to campaigning, but never rose above the rank of captain, owing to his being unable to get leave at court to buy a regiment. In 1737 he came into the family property on his father’s death, and spent some pleasant years till 1743 in literary companionship with his dear friends Vauvenargues and Lefranc de Pompignan, which might have continued had he not suddenly determined to marry—not for money, but for landed estates. The lady whose property he fancied was Marie Genevieve, daughter of a Μ. de Vassan, a brigadier in the army, and widow of the Marquis de Saulvebceuf, whom he married without previously seeing her on April 21,1743. While in garrison at Bordeaux, Mirabeau had made the acquaintance of Montesquieu, which may have made him turn his thoughts to political speculations; anyhow it was while at leisure after retiring from the army that he wrote his first work, his Testament Politique (1747), which demanded for the prosperity of France a return of the French noblesse to their old position in the Middle Ages. This work, written under the influence of the feudal ideas impressed upon him by his father, was followed in 1750 by a book on the Utilité des États Provenciaux, full of really wise considerations for local self-government, which was published anonymously, and had the honour of being attributed to Montesquieu himself. In 1756 Mirabeau made his first appearance as a political economist by the publication of his Ami des Hommes ou traité de la population. This work has been often attributed to the influence, and in part even to the pen, of Quesnay, the founder of the economical school of the physiocrats, but was really written before the marquis had made the acquaintance of the physician of Madame de Pompadour. In 1760 he published his Théorie de V Impôt, in which he attacked with all the vehemence of his son the farmers-general of the taxes, who got him imprisoned for eight days at Vincennes, and then exiled to his country estate at Bignon. At Bignon the school of the physiocrats was really established, and the marquis surrounded himself with devotees, and eventually in 1765 bought the Journal de Vagriculture, du commerce, et des finances, which became the organ of the school. He was distinctly recognized as a leader of political thinkers by Prince Leopold of Tuscany, afterwards emperor, and by Gustavus III. of Sweden, who in 1772 sent him the grand cross of the order of Vasa. But the period of his happy literary life was over; and his name was to be mixed up in a long scandalous lawsuit. Naturally his marriage had not been happy; he had separated from his wife by mutual consent in 1762, and had, he believed, secured her safely in the provinces by a lettre de cachet, when in 1772 she suddenly appeared in Paris, and soon after commenced proceedings for a separation. The poor marquis did not know what to do; his sons were a great trouble to him, and it was one of his own daughters who had encouraged his wife to take this step. Yet he was determined to keep the case quiet if possible for the sake of Madame de Pailly, a Swiss lady whom he had loved since 1756. But his wife would not let him rest; her plea was rejected in 1777, but she renewed her suit, and, though the great Mirabeau had pleaded his father’s case, was successful in 1781, when a decree of separation was pronounced. This trial had quite broken the health of the marquis, as well as his fortune; he sold his estate at Bignon, and hired a house at Argenteuil, where he lived quietly till his death on July 11, 1789.

For the whole family of Mirabeau, the one book to refer to is Louis de Loménie’s Les Mirabeau, 2 vols., 1878, and it is greatly to be regretted that the talented author did not live to treat the lives of the great Mirabeau and his brother. See also Lucas de Montigny’s Mémoires de Mirabeau, and, for the marquis’s economical views, De la Vergne’s Économistes français du 18" e siècle.
