MINO DI GIOVANNI (1431-1486), called da Fiesole, was born at Poppi in the Casentino in 1431. He had property at Fiesole, whence his usual name. Vasari’s account of him is very inaccurate and full of contradictions. Mino was a friend and fellow-worker both with D. da Settignano and Matteo Civitale, all three being about the same age. There is considerable similarity in their works, showing mutual influence. Mino’s sculpture is remarkable for its gem-like finish and extreme delicacy of detail, as well as for its spirituality and strong devotional feeling. No other sculptor portrayed the virginal purity of the Madonna or the soft infant beauty of the Divine Child with greater tenderness and refinement. Of Mino’s earlier works, the finest are in the duomo of Fiesole, the altarpiece [9:16:478] and tomb of Bishop Salutati, executed about 1464. In the Badia of Florence are some of Mino’s most important sculptures—an altarpiece, and the tombs of Bernardo Giugni, 1466, and the Margrave Hugo, 1481—all sculptured in white marble, with beautiful life-sized recumbent effigies and attendant angels. The pulpit in Prato cathedral, finished in 1473, is very delicately sculptured, with bas-reliefs of great minuteness, but somewhat weakly designed. Soon after the completion of this work Mino paid a visit of some years to Rome, where he executed several fine pieces of sculpture, such as the tomb of Pope Paul II. (now in the crypt of St Peter’s), the tomb of Francesco Tornabuoni in S. Maria Sopra Minerva, and a beautiful little marble tabernacle for the holy oils in S. Maria in Trastevere. There can be little doubt that he was also the sculptor of several of the very lovely monuments in S. Maria del Popolo, especially those in the sacristy of Bishop Gomiel and Archbishop Rocca, 1482, and the marble reredos, also in the sacristy, given by Pope Alexander VI. Some of Mino’s portrait busts and delicate profile bas-reliefs are preserved in the Bargello at Florence; they are full of life and expression, though without the extreme realism of Verrocchio and other sculptors of his time. He died in 1486.
