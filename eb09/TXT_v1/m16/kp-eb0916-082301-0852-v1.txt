MORGAN, Sydney Owenson, Lady (1777 M859), novelist and miscellaneous describer and critic, was one of the most vivid and hotly-discussed literary personages of her generation. She was the daughter of an Irish actor, but it was one of her whims to keep the year of her birth a secret; “once upon a time” on Christmas day was her answer to inquiries. She began her literary career with a precocious volume of poems. Her second venture, St Clair (1804), a novel of ill-judged marriage, ill-starred love, and impassioned nature-worship, in which the influence of Goethe and Rousseau was apparent, at once attracted attention. Another novel, The Novice of St Dominick (1806), was also praised for its qualities of copious imagination and description, though the critics were inclined to nibble at the writer’s grammar. But the book which made her reputation and brought her name into warm controversy was The Wild Irish Girl, also published in 1806. In this she appeared as the ardent champion of her native country, a politician rather than a novelist, extolling the beauty of Irish scenery, the richness of the natural wealth of Ireland, the noble traditions of its early history, and sketching types of the various classes with direct reference to the misgovernment to which she traced their evil features. She followed this up with Patriotic Sketches and Metrical Fragments in 1807, fitting some Irish melodies with words (“Kate Kearney” among the number) in the same year in which Moore began a similar task. Miss 0wen-son’s politics and the favour shown her by the Whig aristocracy probably prompted the savage attack made upon her next novel, Ida, a Woman of Athens, in the first number of the Quarterly (1809). From first to last her style was open to the reproach of being made up too much of quotations, and her grammar was not always correct; but exuberant humour, keen wit, and fertility in the invention of striking and romantic incidents carry any unbiassed reader easily over all minor faults of composition. Her great ambition was to draw vivid pictures of the mingled “mirth and misery, ferocity and fun,” of the Irish under English rule, and she succeeded. Her novels suffer as stories from this political purpose; she drags in too many character-sketches, and, though they are always drawn with vivacity and sharp penetration, they are drawn with too much bias of romantic enthusiasm on the one side and satirical spite on the other. In 1812 she was married to Sir T. C. Morgan, but books still continued to flow from her facile pen. In 1814 she produced her best novel, O'Donnel, a decided advance on previous work. She published an elaborate study of France under the Bourbon restoration in 1817. This was attacked with outrageous fury in the Quarterly, the authoress being accused of Jacobinism, falsehood, licentiousness, and impiety. She took her revenge indirectly in the novel of Florence Macarthy (1818), in which a Quarterly reviewer, Con Crawley, is insulted with supreme feminine ingenuity. Italy, a companion work to her France, was published in 1821; Lord Byron bears testimony to the justness of its pictures of life. The results of Italian historical studies were given in her Life and Times of Salvator Rosa (1824). Then she turned again to Irish manners and politics with a matter-of-fact book on Absenteeism (1825), and a highly stirring and romantic novel, The O'Briens and the O’Flaherty» (1827). The Book of the Boudoir (1829) consisted of miscellaneous reflexions and reminiscences. Under the ministry of Lord Grey Lady Morgan obtained a pension of £300. During the last thirty years of her long life she broke no new ground, but to the last she was an entertaining writer, and sent some sprightly verses to the Athenseum [9:16:824] in January 1859, a few weeks before her death, protesting against being called old. The titles of her books in this period are :— France in 1829-30, Dramatic Scenes from Real Life (1833), The Princess (1835), Woman and her Master (1840), The Book without a Name (1841), Passages from my Autobiography (1859). More of her autobiography and many interesting letters were edited with a memoir by Hepworth Dixon in 1862. He respected her prejudice against disclosing her exact age.
