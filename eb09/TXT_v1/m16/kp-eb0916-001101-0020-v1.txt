MENIN, a small Belgian town, in the province of West Flanders; it is traversed by the river Lys, which there forms the boundary between France and Belgium. The population in 1880 was 10,200. Commercially and industrially Menin ranks high for its size, possessing, as it does, important manufactures of linen, oil, soap, &c., as well as sugar refineries, breweries, and tanneries, and a good corn and cattle market. Tobacco is extensively grown in the neighbourhood, and forms one of the main items of lawful trade, a good deal of illicit traffic also being carried on across the French frontier.

Menin does not appear to have been in any way worthy of note until the 14th century. Philip II. caused it to be fortified in 1578. It was taken by Turenne in 1658. Vauban subsequently surrounded it with elaborate works, and made it one of the strongest citadels in France; but all its fortifications were razed in 1744. It belonged to the Netherlands in 1815, and became part of Belgium in 1830.
