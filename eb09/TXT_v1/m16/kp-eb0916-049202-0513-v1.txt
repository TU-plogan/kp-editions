MINUCIUS FELIX, Marcus, one of the earliest, if not the earliest, of the Latin apologists for Christianity. Of his personal history nothing is known, and even the date at which he wrote can be only approximately ascertained. Jerome (De Vir. III., 58) speaks of him as “Romae insignis causidicus,” but in this he is probably only improving on the expression of Lactantius {Inst. Div., v. 1) who speaks of him as “non ignobilis inter causidicos loci.” He is now exclusively known by his Octavius, a dialogue on Christianity between the pagan Caecilius Natalis^[1. This name occurs in six inscriptions of the years 211-217 found at Constantine (Cirta), North Africa (C , . I. I.., vol. viii.).] and the Christian Octavius Januarius, a provincial solicitor, the friend and fellow-student of the author. The scene is pleasantly and graphically laid on the beach at Ostia on a holiday afternoon, and the discussion is represented as arising out of the homage paid by Caecilius, in passing, to the image of Serapis. His arguments for paganism, which proceed partly upon agnostic grounds, partly upon the inexpediency of disturbing long-established religious beliefs, partly upon the known want of culture in Christians, the alleged indecency of their worship, and the inherent absurdity of their doctrines, are taken up seriatim by Octavius, with the result that the assailant is convinced, postponing, however, the discussion of some things necessary for perfect instruction to a future occasion. The form of the dialogue, modelled on the De Natura Deorum and De Divinatione of Cicero, shows much care and ability, and its style is on the whole both vigorous and elegant if at times not exempt from something of the affectations of the age. If the doctrines of the Divine unity, the resurrection, and future rewards and punishments be left out of account, the work has less the character of an exposition of Christianity than of a philosophical and ethical polemic against the absurdities of crass polytheism. Christology and the other metaphysics of distinctively Christian theology are entirely passed over, and the canonical Scriptures are not quoted, hardly even alluded to.

The Octavius is admittedly earlier than Cyprian’s De Idolorum Vanitate, which borrows from it; how much earlier can be determined only by settling the relation in which it stands to Tertullian’s Apologeticum. The argument for the priority of Minucius has been most exhaustively set forth by Ebert ( “Tertullians Verhältniss zu Minucius Felix,” in vol. v. of the philologico-historical series in Abhandl. d. König. Sachs. Gesellsch. der Wissenschaften, 1868), who has been followed byTeuffel (Röm. Lit., sec. 368), Keiιr (Celsus' Wahres Wort, 1873), Kuhn, and other scholars. The opposite view is ably maintained by Professor Salmon (“Minucius Felix” in Smith’s Diet. Christ. Biogr., 1882). The Octavius was first printed (Rome, 1543) as the eighth book of Arnobius Adv. Gentes ; Balduinus (Heidelberg, 1560) first assigned it to its proper author. There have been numerous subsequent editions, the best being that of Halm in the Corp. Scriptor. Eccl. Lat. (Vienna, 1867). See Kuhn’s monograph, Der Octavius des Minucius Felix (1882).
