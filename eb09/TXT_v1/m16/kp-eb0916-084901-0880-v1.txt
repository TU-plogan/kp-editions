MORTIFICATION, a term used in surgery signifying a local death. Any cause which interferes with the bloodsupply of a portion of the body will, if sufficiently prolonged or sufficiently severe, give rise to mortification. In some cases the death may be preceded by inflammation; in others, as in old people with diseased vessels, the part may die in consequence simply of insufficient blood-supply without any previous inflammation. The part is said to mortify; the process is termed gangrene; the dead part is called a slough. A severe injury may end in mortification. Extreme heat as in severe burns, or extreme cold as in frost-bite, may give rise to the condition. Those parts of the body farthest from the centre of the circulation are most liable to mortification. Frost-bite, for example, may attack the toes or fingers as well as those parts which are most exposed to the cold, more particularly the point of the nose or the ears. The part affected becomes pale, bloodless, cold, and insensible. The great point to attend to is to restore the circulation gradually, using gentle friction. If the person is brought before a fire, or if any hot applications are used, then a rapid reaction may issue in a severe inflammation, which may be followed by mortification. Chilblain is a mild form of frost-bite occurring in young people with sluggish circulations, very often caused by sitting down before a strong fire with cold feet; any one suffering from cold feet or hands should take plenty of exercise, and if after a return from a sharp walk the feet remain cold the heat should be restored by rubbing with a rough towel.
