MOISSAC, chief town of an arrondissement in the department of Tarn-et-Garonne, France, is situated on the right bank of the Tarn, and on the railway line from Bordeaux to Cette, 17 miles west-north-west of Montauban. The church of St Peter, belonging to the 15 th century, has a doorway of the 12th century, remarkable for its elaborate and beautiful sculpture, representing Scriptural scenes. Connected with the choir of the church is a cloister dating from the beginning of the 12th century, and one of the finest specimens of this kind of building in France; the pointed arches are supported by small columns with sculptured capitals. The town has a large trade in corn and flour, and the mills afford employment to a considerable number of persons. The population in 1881 was 9202.

The town owes its origin to an abbey founded between 630 and 640 by St Àmand, the friend of Dagobert. After being devastated by the Saracens, the abbey was restored by Louis of Aquitaine, son of Charlemagne. Subsequently it was made dependent on Cluny, but in 1618 it was secularized by Pope Paul V., and replaced by a house of Augustinian monks, which was suppressed at the Revolution. The town, which was erected into •a commune in the 13th century, was taken by Richard Coeur de Lion, and by Simon de Montfort.
