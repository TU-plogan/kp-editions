MONTGOMERY (Welsh, Sirydd Tre Faldwyn), an inland county of Wales, is bounded E. by Shropshire, N.E. by Denbigh, N.W. by Merioneth, S.W. by Cardigan, and S. by Radnor. Its greatest length from south-east to northwest is about 40 miles, and its breadth from east to west about 35 miles. The area is 495,089 acres, or about 773 square miles. The surface is broken and undulating, but it is only round the borders of the çounty that the hills reach any great height, the highest summits of the different ranges being generally in the adjoining counties. To the north are the Berwyn chain, stretching into Denbighshire, in the east the Breidden hills, in the south the Kerry hills, and in the south-west Plinlimmon, the highest summit of which is in Cardigan. These various mountain ranges form the watershed of the numerous rivers of Montgomeryshire. With the exception of the Dyfi, which rises near Bala Lake and falls into Cardigan Bay, and the Wyθ, which flows south into Radnorshire, all the principal rivers are tributaries of the Severn (Welsh, Hafren), which rises on the east side of Plinlimmon and traverses the whole length of the county from south-west to north-east. The principal of these tributaries are the Clywedog, the Taranon, the Rhiew, and the Vyrnwy. This fine succession of rivervalleys broaden out as they reach the great vale of the Severn, and the beauty of the scenery is enhanced by an abundance of oak and other trees. The Montgomeryshire canal, which has a length of 27 miles, and passes the principal towns, is connected with the Ellesmere canal, thus affording water communication with Chester and Shrewsbury.

Montgomeryshire is occupied chiefly by Lower Silurian rocks. The boundary between it and Merioneth is formed by the Bala beds. In the centre and east, near Llanfair and Montgomery, Wenlock shales prevail. In the neighbourhood of Welshpool the Silurian rocks have been frequently dislocated by volcanic masses, one of the most [9:16:789] remarkable of which is Comdon Hill, rising to a height of 1700 feet. In some places the sedimentary rocks have been penetrated by trap mingled with shale or schist. Along the lines of dislocation there are frequent deposits of metallic lodes, carried there by the heated water rising from below. The lead mines of Montgomeryshire are of considerable importance, and at present the metal is wrought at seven different places. In 1881 the amount of lead ore obtained in the various mines was 3432 tons, yielding 2693 tons of lead and 25,432 oz. of silver, the total value being £36,495. There were also obtained 1414 tons of zinc ore, yielding 610 tons of zinc, of a total value of £3231.

Agriculture.— The climate is mild and genial, and the soil in the valleys remarkably fertile, especially along the banks of the Severn. A considerable portion on the borders of Merioneth is, however, occupied chiefly by heath and moss. The number of holdings has been rather decreasing of late years, the decrease being chiefly in those below 50 acres in extent, which in 1880 (the latest year regarding which there is information) numbered 3572, while there were 1650 between 50 and 300 acres, and 45 above 300 acres, of which 2 were above 1000. According to the agricultural returns of 1882, the total area of arable land was 256,084 acres, or nearly one-half of the whole. Of this 53,538 were under corn crops, 163,441 were permanent pasture, 23,882 rotation grasses, and only 11,107 green crops; 457 acres were under orchards, 2 under market gardens, 37 under nursery grounds, and 22,744 under woods. Of the corn crops, wheat occupied 18,665 acres, and oats 23,937 acres. Cattle, which are chiefly Herefords and cross-breeds, though there are some Devons and a few of the old Montgomeryshire breed, numbered 62,033 in 1882, of which 21,912 were cows and heifers in milk or in calf. Horses in 1882 numbered 13,985, of which 7060 were used solely for agricultural purposes. The county was long famous for its hardy breed of small horses called merlins, which are still to be met with. Many good hunters and cart-horses are now bred. The number of sheep in 1882 was 305,641. On some of the heath lands in the centre and west of the county a diminutive breed of sheep called duns is pastured, but those kept in the better cultivated regions are principally Shropshire Downs. According to the latest return, the land was divided among 3241 proprietors, possessing 387,342 acres, with a gross annual rental of £378,512. Of these, 1314, or 40 per cent., possessed less than one acre, 32 possessed between 1000 and 2000 acres, and 25 between 2000 and 5000; the following possessed upwards of 5000 acres, viz.—Earl Powis, 33,545; Sir W. W. Wynn, 32,963; Lord Sudeley, 17,158; J. Naylor, 9275; and marquis of Londonderry, 7400.

Manufactures.— In all the towns the manufacture of woollen cloth, especially Welsh flannel, is carried on, and although the industry was lately on the decline it is now reviving.

Administration and Population.— Montgomeryshire comprises nine hundreds, and the municipal boroughs of Llanidloes (3421) and Welshpool (7107). Llanfyllin, Llanidloes, Machynlleth, Montgomery, Newtown, and Welshpool form the Montgomery district of boroughs, with a total population in 1881 of 19,925, and return one member to parliament. One member is also returned for the county. Montgomeryshire is partly in the dioceses of Bangor, Hereford, and St Asaph, and contains sixty-eight civil parishes, townships, or places, as well as parts of other parishes in adj oining counties. From 65,700 in 1831 the population had increased in 1851 to 67,335, and in 1871 to 67,623, but in 1881 it had diminished to 65,718, of whom 33,004 were males and 32,714 females.

History.— At the time of the Roman invasion, Montgomery was possessed by a tribe of the Cymri called Ordovices. Traces of several of the old British camps still remain, the principal being those at Dolarddyn, on Breidden Hill, and at Caereinion. There are also a large number of cairns and barrows. The county was traversed by the great Roman road, the Via Dcυana, which was joined by a number of others; but the remains of Roman camps or stations are unimportant. After being vacated by the Romans, little is known of the history of Montgomery, until Wales was subdivided into three districts at the death of Rhodri the Great. Montgomery was then included under Powys, and formed the chief portion of Powys Gwenwynwyn, sometimes called Upper Powys. Powys or Powιs Castle, the seat of the rulers of Upper Powys, was founded in 1108. Baldwyn, from which the county takes its Welsh name, was lieutenant of the marches; and, for the purpose of holding the district in check, a castle was built about the end of the 11th century, which, after being captured by the natives, was retaken by Roger de Montgomery. He gave his name to the castle, and to the surrounding district of ancient Powys, which was made a county by Henry VIII. in 1533. ·

Montgomery, the county town, is situated on the declivity of a well-wooded hill near the eastern bank of the Severn, 21 j miles south by west of Shrewsbury, and 187∣ by rail north-west by north of London. It is a clean and well-built town, but somewhat scattered and irregular. The principal buildings are the parish church of Saint Nicholas (an old cruciform structure) and the town-hall. The borough has returned members to parliament since the time of Henry VIII., but by the Reform Act of 1832 it was constituted one of the Montgomery district of boroughs, which together return one member. The population of the borough (area, 3323 acres) was 1194 in 1881.

There are only a few crumbling remains of the old fortress of Montgomery, originally founded in the time of William the Conqueror to overawe the Welsh, and held by Roger de Montgomery, from whom the town takes its name. The castle was greatly enlarged in the time of Henry III., when it was the scene of frequent contests between that monarch and Llewelyn the Great. In the 14th century it was held by the Mortimers, from whom it passed to the house of York. By the crown it was granted in the 15th century to the Herberts of Cherbury, but during the Civil War it was surrendered by Lord Herbert of Cherbury to the Parliamentary forces, by whom it was dismantled.
