BOYLE, Charles, earl of Orrery in Ireland, and baron of Marston, in the county of Somerset, the second son of Roger second earl of Orrery, was born at Chelsea in 1676. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, and soon distinguished himself by his learning and abilities. Like the first earl of Orrery, he was an author, soldier, and statesman. He translated Plutarch’s life of Lysander, and published an edition of the epistles of Phalaris, which engaged him in the famous controversy with Bentley. See Atterbury and Bentley. He was three times member for the town of Huntingdon; and on the death of his brother, Lionel, earl of Orrery, in 1703, he succeeded to that title. He entered the army, and in 1709 was raised to the rank of major-general, and sworn one of her Majesty’s privy council. At the battle of the Wood he acted with distinguished bravery. He was appointed queen’s envoy to the states of Brabant and Flanders; and having discharged this trust with ability, he was created an English peer, as Baron of Marston, in Somersetshire. He received several additional honours in the reign of George I.; but having had the misfortune to fall under the suspicion of the Government he was committed to the Tower, where he remained six months, and was then admitted to bail. On a subsequent inquiry it was found impossible to criminate him, and he was discharged. He died, after a slight illness, on the 28th of August 1731. Among the works of Roger, earl of Orrery, will be found a comedy, entitled As you find it, written by Charles Boyle. The orrery, an astronomical instrument, invented, or at least constructed, by Graham, was named after the earl, who used to amuse his leisure hours with mechanical toys.
