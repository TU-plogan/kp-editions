BROWNE, William, an English poet, descended of a good family, was born at Tavistock in Devonshire, in 1590. Having passed through the grammar school of his native place, he was sent to Exeter College, Oxford, and became tutor to Robert Dormer, afterwards earl of Carnarvon. After having received in 1624 the honorary degree of M.A., he was taken into the family of William, earl of Pembroke, and improved his fortune so much that he is said to have purchased an estate. Nothing seems to be known of his after life, and no date has ever been given for his death. All his work was done in his youth, the first part of Britannia's Pastorals having been published in 1613, The Shepherd's Pipe in 1614, and the second part of the Pastorals in 1616. He belongs to the school of Spenser, and his merits may be summed up briefly as extreme sweetness of verse, idyllic nature-painting, and richness of descriptive faculty. The Pastorals are about the finest specimens we have in earlier literature of luxuriant sensuous description of ordinary country life. They were highly popular in their time. (See Wood, Athen. Oxon.)
