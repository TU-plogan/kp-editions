BROWN, John, D.D., an eminent Scottish divine, son of the Rev. John Brown of Whitburn, and grandson of the Rev. John Brown of Haddington, was born at Whitburn, Linlithgowshire, on the 12th July 1784. He studied at Glasgow university, and afterwards at the divinity hall of the “Burgher” branch of the “Secession” Church at Selkirk, under the celebrated Lawson. In 1806 he was ordained minister of the Burgher congregation at Biggar, Lanarkshire, where he continued to labour for sixteen years with growing popularity. Transferred in 1822 to the charge of Rose Street church, Edinburgh, he at once took a high rank as a preacher. Deficient in imagination and in spontaneity of utterance, he had nearly all the other qualities of a pulpit orator,—a powerful and flexible voice, a presence at once winning and commanding, clear and persuasive reasoning, and a habitual earnestness, rising not unfrequently into fervour. In 1829 he succeeded Dr Hall in the pastoral charge of Broughton Place church, Edinburgh, where his congregation speedily became one of the largest in the city. In 1835 he was appointed one of the professors in the theological hall of the Secession Church, and, great as was his ability as a preacher and pastor, it was probably in this sphere that he rendered his most valuable service to his own denomination and the church at large. He had been the first in Scotland to introduce in his pulpit ministrations what is known as the exegetical method of exposition of Scripture, and he fully availed himself of his position as a professor to illustrate the [9:4:385] method and extend its use. To him probably more than to any other man is due the abandonment of the radically vicious principle of interpretation according to the “analogy of faith,” which practically subordinated the Bible to the Creed. To his favourite task of exegesis, which he himself described as the main object of his public life, Dr Brown brought a rare critical sagacity, exact and extensive scholarship, unswerving honesty, and a clear, logical style. His expository works, noted below, have accordingly a permanent value. Dr Brown was naturally of a retiring disposition, but the strength of his convictions forced him to take a prominent part in the chief religious and political discussions of his time. He had a considerable share in the Apocrypha controversy, and he was throughout life a vigorous and consistent upholder of anti-state-church or “voluntary” views. His two sermons on The Law of Christ'respecting civil obedience, especially in the payment of tribute, called forth by a local grievance from which he had personally suffered, were afterwards published with extensive additions and notes, and are still regarded as an admirable statement and defence of the voluntary principle. In a discussion which agitated his denomination for several years in regard to the nature and extent of the atonement, Dr Brown took a part which led to a formal charge of heresy being preferred against him. In 1845, after the to him peculiarly painful ordeal of a somewhat protracted trial, he was acquitted by the Synod. From that time he enjoyed the thorough confidence of his denomination (after 1847 “the United Presbyterian Church”), of which in his later years he was generally regarded as the leading representative. Dr Brown died on the 13th October 1858.

Dr Brown’s chief works were— Expository Discourses on First Peter (1848); Exposition of the Discourses and Sayings of our Lord (1850); Exposition of our Lord's Intercessory Prayer (1850); The Resurrection of Life (1851); Exposition of the Epistle to the Galatians (1853); and Analytical Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans (1857). See Memoir of John Brown, D.D., by John Cairns (1860).
