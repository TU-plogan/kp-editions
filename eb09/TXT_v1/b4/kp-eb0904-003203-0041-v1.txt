BONGO, a people of Central Africa, who inhabit the country lying between 6° and 8° N. lat., and 27° and 29° E. long., which is watered by five important tributaries of the Bahr-el-Ghazel. The Bongo are a brachyceρhalous race of medium height, with a red-brown complexion and black hair. The grain most largely cultivated by them is sorghum; but they obtain a considerable part of their food from the fruits, tubers, and fungi with which the country naturally abounds. They also eat every living creature—bird, beast, and reptile—except the dog. Tobacco is universally cultivated and smoked. They have no cotton or flax, and go for the most part with no more clothing than an ornamental girdle about the loins. The domestic animals are goats, dogs, and poultry; sheep and cattle are rare. Iron is abundant, and the people smelt and work it with great skill; it forms the only currency of the country, and is extensively employed for all kinds of useful and ornamental purposes. Their spears, knives, rings, and other articles are frequently fashioned with great artistic elaboration. They have a variety of musical instruments,— drums, stringed instruments, and horns,—in the practice of which they take great delight; and they indulge in a vocal recitative which seems intended to imitate a succession of natural sounds. Marriage is generally by purchase; and a man is allowed to acquire three wives, but not more. After marriage the women extend the under lip by the insertion of a peg of wood or bone, which is gradually increased. Tattooing is partially practised. Their method of sepulture resembles that of the Peruvians, the corpse being bound in a crouching position with the knees drawn up to the chin; and their tombs are frequently ornamented with rough wooden figures intended to represent the deceased. Of the immortality of the soul they have no notion; and their only approach to a knowledge of a deity consists in a vague idea of luck. On the other hand they have a most intense belief in a great variety of petty goblins and witches, which are identified with bats, owls, and other ominous animals. Their language is musical, and abounds in the vowels 0 and a; its vocabulary of concrete terms is very rich, but the same word has often great variety of meanings. The grammatical structure is simple. The Bongo are now subject to the people of Khartoom, who have treated them with great injustice, and greatly reduced the numbers of the population, which now hardly exceeds 100,000.
