BOSNIA, the most north-westerly province of Turkey in Europe, comprising Bosnia Proper, a part of Turkish-Croatia, or Craina, the district of Herzegovina, and the ancient Rascia. It extends from 42° 37 to 45° 15' Ν. lat., and from 15° 40' to 21° 2' E. long; is bounded on the N. and W. by the Austrian dominions, S. by Montenegro and Albania, and E. by Servia; and has an area of about 24,024 square miles. The whole province, with the exception of the valley of the Save, is more or less mountainous, many of the summits reaching the height of 6000 feet. A large proportion of the surface is valuable forest-land, which furnishes almost inexhaustible stores of timber and fuel. Plums are largely grown in the northern portion and ex ported as prunes,—Beska on the Save being one of the chief centres of the trade. In Herzegovina the vine, olive, fig, and pomegranate flourish. Maize and wheat are the principal grains in cultivation, but barley, oats, hemp, and even rice are also grown. Abundance of pasture land occurs throughout the province, and cattle, sheep, and goats are reared; the number of the cattle was, however, greatly diminished by the plague in the decade ending with 1870. Large droves of swine are fed in the oak-forests. In mineral deposits the country is especially rich. The whole valley of the Bosnia is said to be one enormous coal-bed; copper is worked in several places, and at Inatch is a very valuable cinnabar mine. There are also some quarries of good marble, and at Tuzla is a copious spring of salt water, from which culinary salt is manufactured, though the demand for this article has still to be met by a foreign supply. The manufactures of the province are on a small scale; they include leather, cloth, and iron wares. The principal exports are fruit, timber, cattle, wool, raw lamb-skins, furs of wild animals, wax, and honey. The foreign trade is almost solely confined to the Austrian dominions,—the lack of a port on the Adriatic greatly impeding the intercourse by sea. Within the last ten years there have been constructed several carriage roads, the most important of which are from the capital to Brood, Gradishka, Mostar, and Yenibazar respectively. A railway has been constructed from Rasnice in Austria to Banyaluka, forming part of a great connecting line between Constantinople and Western Europe. The province is divided into the seven sandjaks of Banyaluka, Bihac, Herzegovina, Yenibazar, Seraïevo, Travnik, and Zvornik. Ethnologically it is Servian, not even the aristocracy being Turks, though they are principally Mahometans. A small part of the south has an Albanian population. Mahometanism is not only predominant, but is sometimes enforced by persecution. Education is said to be greatly neglected, though from the native statistics a different judgment might be formed, no fewer than 1079 schools being registered; but of these a large proportion are attached to the mosques, and have a merely nominal existence. The total revenue of the province was, in 1871, 50,589,970 piastres (£456,715), and the expenditure, 19,724,745 (£178,070). The population increases very slowly, chiefly owing to mortality among the children occasioned by improper treatment. The climate is by no means unhealthy. The number of the inhabitants has remained almost stationary, being estimated at 1,100,000 in 1844, and at 1,279,296 in 1873. The largest cities after Bosna Seria, the capital, are Banyaluka (15,000), Fotcha, Mostar, Zvornik, and Travnik (about 12,000 each), and Yenibazar (from 9000 to 15,000). Bosnia was at first dependent on the Servian and Croatian kings, but was raised for a time to a separate principality, which reverted about 1339 to the Servian king Stephen. After his death it was again independent, and continued to have its own rulers till the latter half of the 15 th century, in spite of the encroachments of the Turks, who at last succeeded in incorporating it in 1503. The Hungarians long disputed this appropriation, but the country was definitely ceded to Turkey at the peace of Carlovitz in 1699, which was confirmed by the treaty of Sistovar in 1791. It is at present (1875) the scene of a formidable insurrection.
