BYZANTIUM, an ancient Greek city on the shores of the Bosphorus, occupied the most easterly of the seven hills on which the modern Constantinople has been built. It is said to have been founded by a band of Megarians, 667 B.c., but the original settlement having been destroyed in the reign of Darius Hystaspes by the Satrap Otanes, it was recolonized by Pausanias, who wrested it from the hands of the Medes after the battle of Plataea (479 B.c.)— a circumstance which has led several ancient chroniclers to ascribe its foundation to him. Its situation, said to have been fixed by the oracle of Apollo, was remarkable for beauty and security. Its position on the Bosphorus gave it complete control over the extensive corn-trade carried on by the merchants of the West with the northern shores of the Euxine; the absence of tides and the depth of its harbour rendered its quays accessible to vessels of large burden; while the tunny and other fisheries at the mouth of the Lycus were so lucrative as to procure for the deeply-curved bay into which that river fell the appellation of the Golden Horn. The greatest hindrance to its continued prosperity consisted in the miscellaneous character of the population, partly Lacedaemonian and partly Athenian, who flocked to it under Pausanias. From this circumstance it was a subject of dispute between these states, and was alternately in the possession of each, till it achieved its independence of both only to fall into the hands of the Macedonians; and from the same cause arose the violent contests of its intestine factions, which ended in the establishment of a rude and turbulent democracy. About seven years after its second colonization, Cimon wrested it from the Lacedaemonians; but in 440 b.c., it revolted and returned to its former allegiance. Alcibiades, after a severe blockade (408 B.c.), gained possession of the city through the treachery of the Athenian party; and it continued an ally of Athens until 405 B.C., when it was retaken by Lysander after the battle of Aegos-potami, and placed under a Spartan harmost. It was under the Lacedaemonian power when the Ten Thousand, exasperated by the conduct of the governor, made themselves masters of the city, and would have pillaged it had they not been repressed by the firmness and promptitude of Xenophon. In 390 B.c. Thrasybulus, with the assistance of Heraclides and Arche-bius, succeeded in expelling the Lacedaemonian oligarchy, and in restoring democracy and the Athenian influence both in Byzantium and Chalcedon. After having withstood an attempt under Epaminondas to restore it to the Lacedaemonians, Byzantium joined with Rhodes, Chios, Cos, and Mausolus, king of Caria, in throwing off the yoke of Athens, but soon after sought Athenian assistance when Philip of Macedon, having overrun Thrace, advanced against it. The succours which were sent from Athens under Chares, on their arrival suffered a severe defeat from Amyntas, the Macedonian admiral, but in the following year gained a decisive victory under Phocion, and compelled Philip to raise the siege. The deli verandi of the besieged from a surprise, by means of a flash of light which revealed the advancing masses of the Macedonian army, has rendered this siege peculiarly memorable. As a memorial of the miraculous interference the Byzantines erected an altar to Torch-bearing Hecate, and stamped a cresc,ent on their coins as a symbol of the portent, a device which is retained by the Turks to this day. They also granted the Athenians extraordinary privileges, and erected a monument in honour of the event in a public part of the city. During the reign of Alexander, Byzantium was compelled to acknowledge the Macedonian supremacy; after the decay of the Macedonian power, it regained its independence, but suffered from the repeated incursions of the Scythians. The losses which they sustained by land roused the Byzantines to indemnify themselves on the vessels which still crow ded the harbour, and the merchantmen which cleared the straits; but this had the effect of provoking a war with the neighbouring naval powers. The exchequer being drained by the payment of 10,000 pieces of gold to buy off the Gauls who had invaded their territories about 279 B.c., and by the imposition of an annual tribute which was ultimately raised to 80 talents, they were compelled to exact a toll on all the ships which passed the Bosphorus,— a measure which the Rhodians resented and avenged by a war, wherein the Byzantines were defeated. The retreat of the Gauls enabled Byzantium to render considerable services to Rome in the contests with Philip II., Antiochus, and Mithridates. During the first years of its alliance with Rome it held the rank of a free and confederate city; but having sought the arbitration of the capital on some of its domestic disputes, it was subjected to the imperial jurisdiction, and gradually stripped of its privileges, until reduced to the status of an ordinary Roman colony. In recollection of its former services, the Emperor Claudius remitted the heavy tribute which had been imposed on it; but the last remnant of its independence was taken away by Vespasian, who, in answer to a remonstrance from Apollonius of Tyana, taunted the inhabitants with having “forgotten to be free.” During the civil wars, it espoused the party of Pescennius Niger; and though skilfully defended by the engineer Periscus, it was besieged and taken (196 a.d.) by Severus, who destroyed the city, demolished the famous wall, which was built of massive stones so closely rivetted together as to appear one block, put the principal inhabitants to the sword, and subjected the remainder to the Perinthians. This overthrow of Byzantium was a great loss to the empire, since it might have served as an effective protection against the Goths, who afterwards sailed past it into the Mediterranean. Severus, however, afterwards relented, and, rebuilding a large portion of the town, gave it the name of Augusta Antonina. He ornamented the city with baths, and surrounded the hippodrome with porticoes; but it was not till the time of Caracalla that it was restored to its former political privileges. It had scarcely begun to recover its former flourishing position when, from the capricious resentment of Gallienus, the inhabitants were once more put to the sword, and the town given up to be pillaged. From this disaster the inhabitants recovered so far as to be able to give an effectual check to an invasion of the Goths in the reign of Claudius II., and its fortifications were greatly strengthened during the civil wars which followed the abdication of Diocletian. Licinius, after his defeat before Adrianople, retired to Byzantium, where he was besieged by Constantine, and compelled to surrender. To check the inroads of the barbarians on the north of the Black Sea, Diocletian had resolved to transfer his capital to Nicomedia; but Constantine, struck with the advantages which the situation of Byzantium presented, resolved to build a new city there on the site -of the old, and transfer the seat of government to it. The design was quickly put into execution, and the new capital was inaugurated with special ceremonies 330 a.d. See Constantinople.

The ancient historians invariably note the profligacy of the inhabitants of Byzantium. They are described as an idle and depraved people, spending their time for the most part in loitering about the harbour, or carousing over the fine wine of Maronea. In war they trembled at the sound of a trumpet, in peace they quaked before the shouting of their own demagogues; and during the assault of Philip II. they could only be prevailed on to man the walls by the savour of extempore cook-shops distributed along the ramparts. The modern Greeks attribute the introduction of Christianity into Byzantium to St Andrew; and it cer-* tainly had some hold there in the time of Severus.
