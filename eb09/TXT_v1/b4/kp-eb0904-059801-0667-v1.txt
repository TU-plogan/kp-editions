BUTTMANN, Philipp Kahl (1764-1829), a German philologist, was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main in 1764. He was educated at the gymnasium in his native town and at the university of Göttingen. In 1789 he obtained an appointment in the library at Berlin, and for some years he edited Sρener ’ s Journal. In 1796 he became professor at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, a post which he held for twelve years. In 1806 he was admitted to the Academy of Sciences, and in 1811 was made secretary of the Historico-Philological Section. He died in 1829. Buttmann’s writings gave a great impetus to the scientific study of the Greek language, and his grammar is still a work of value. The first edition of the Griechische Grammatik appeared in 1792, and in 1863 the book was in its 21st edition. It has been translated into English. The Lexilogus, a valuable study on some words of difficulty occurring principally in the poems of Homer and Hesiod, was published in 2 vols., 1818-25. The English translation by Fishlake has passed through five editions Buttmann’s other works were Ausführliche Griechische Sprachlehre, 2 vols., 1819-27; Mythologue, a collection of essays, 1828-9; and editions of some classical authors. Of these last the most important are Demosthenes in Midiam, 1823, and the continuation of Spalding’s Quintilian.
