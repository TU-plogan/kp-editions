BURNET, Thomas (1635-1715), best known as the author of The Sacred Theory of the Earth, was born at Croft in Yorkshire about the year 1635, but is supposed to have been descended of a Scottish family. He was educated at the free school of Northallerton, and in June 1651 was admitted a pensioner of Clare Hall at Cambridge, under the tuition of Tillotson, who continued to remember him with kindness. In the year 1654 he removed to Christ’s College, on the election of Dr Cudworth to the mastership, and there he obtained a fellowship in the year 1657. In 1661 he became senior proctor of the university. He was successively domestic tutor to Charles duke of Bolton, and to James earl of Ossory, afterwards duke of Ormond, grandson to the first duke; and by the interest of the latter nobleman he was chosen master of the Charterhouse in 1685. Among the electors some of the bishops opposed him on account of his wearing a lay habit; but the duke was satisfied that he possessed the more essential qualifications of a life and conversation suitable to his clerical character. After this appointment he took the degree of D.D. In his capacity of master he made a noble stand against the illegal attempts to admit Andrew Popham as a pensioner of the house, strenuously opposing an order of the 26th of December 1686, addressed by James II. to the governors dispensing with the statutes for the occasion.

Dr Burnet published his Telluris Theoria Sacra, or Sacred Theory of the Earth, at London in 1681. This work, containing a fanciful theory of the earth’s structure, attracted an unusual share of public attention, and he was afterwards encouraged to issue an English translation, which was printed in folio, 1684-1689. Addison commended the author in a Latin ode, but his theory was attacked by Dr Keill, Mr Whiston, and Mr Warren, to all of whom he returned answers. His reputation obtained for him an introduction at court by Archbishop Tillotson, whom he succeeded as clerk of the closet to King William. He seemed already to be on the direct road to much higher preferment, when he suddenly marred his prospects by the publication, in 1692, of a work entitled Archao- logioe Philosophicae : sive Doctrina antiqua de Rerum Originibus, in which lie treated the Mosaic account of the fall of man as an allegory. The method of treatment excited a great clamour against him; and the king was obliged to remove him from his office at court. Ot this book, an English translation was executed by Mr Foxton, Lond. 1729, 8vo. Dr Burnet published several other minor works before his death, which took place at the Charter-house on the 27tl∣ September 1715. Two posthumous works were published several years after his death— De Fide et Officiis Christianorum, 1723, anà De Statu Mortuorum et Resurgentium Tractatus, 1723; in which he maintained the doctrine of a middle state, the millennium, and the limited duration of future punishment. A Life of Dr Burnet by Heathcote appeared in 1759.
