BORNHOLM, an island in the Baltic, belonging to Denmark, in the “Stift” of Seeland, between 54° 59' and 55° 18' N. lat., and between 14° 42' and 15° 8' E. long. It is about 20 miles in length by 14 in breadth, with a generally mountainous surface and steep and rocky shores. Besides a good freestone, which is largely exported for building, it furnishes limestone, blue marble, coal, and clay. Oats, flax, and hemp are cultivated. The population amounts to about 33,000, and is chiefly employed in agriculture, fishing, brewing, distillation, and the manufacture of earthenware. Weaving and clock-making are also carried on to some extent. The capital is Rönne, and there are six other small towns on the island,—Svanike, Nexöe, Hasle, Allinge, and Sandvig,—the total town population amounting to 11,100. On the north-west coast are the ruins of the castle of Hammershuus, which was built in 1158, and long served as a state-prison; while another old castle, erected by Christian V. in 1684, and important as commanding the entrance to the Baltic, is situated on Christiansöe, one of a small group of islands about 11 miles to the north-east. The island of Bornholm has had a very eventful history. For a short time, in the 9th century, it formed a separate principality or kingdom, which was afterwards united to Denmark. In 1510 it was captured by the Hanseatic League, and in 1522 it became directly subject to the city of Lubeck. In 1645 the Swedes took it by storm, and their possession of it was confirmed by the peace of Roeskild in 1658; but the sympathies of the people were with Denmark, and a popular insurrection succeeded in expelling the Swedish forces.
