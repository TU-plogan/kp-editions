BRASSEY, Thomas, an eminent English railway contractor, a man remarkable for his character and abilities as well as for the vast extent and singular success of his [9:4:220] undertakings, was born at Baerton, near Chester, November 7, 1805. He was the son of a landed proprietor, of ancient family, and received an ordinary commercial education at a Chester school. He began his professional career at the age of sixteen as apprentice to Mr Lawton, a surveyor, and on the completion of his term became the partner of his master. Soon after his marriage his master died, and he assumed the sole management of the business. In the local surveys to which he devoted his attention during his early years he acquired the knowledge and practical experience which were the necessaryfoundation of his great reputation. His first engagement as railway contractor was entered upon in 1835, when, on the invitation of the distinguished engineer Joseph Locke, he undertook the execution of a portion of the Grand Junction Railway. Soon after Mr Locke entrusted him with the completion of the London and Southampton Railway, a task which involved contracts to the amount of £4,000,000 sterling and the employment of a body of 3000 men. At the same time he was engaged on portions of several other lines in the north of England and in Scotland. In conjunction with his partner, Mr W. Mackenzie, Brassey undertook, in 1840, the construction of the railway from Paris to Rouen, of which Mr Locke was engineer. He subsequently carried out the extension of the same line. A few years later he was engaged with his partner on five other French lines, and on his own account on the same number of lines in England, Wales, and Scotland. “At this time,” says The Builder, “the industrial army set in motion and controlled by Mr Brassey amounted to 75,000 men, and his weekly payments must have distributed, as the price of labour, from £15,000 to £20,000 every Saturday. The capital involved in these various contracts amounted to some £36,000,000 sterling.” But his energy and capacity were equal to still larger tasks. He undertook in 1851 other works in England and in Scotland; and in the following year he engaged in the construction of railways in Holland, Prussia, Spain, and Italy. One of his vastest undertakings was the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada, 1100 miles in length, with its astonishing bridge over the River St Lawrence. In this work he was associated with Peto and Betts. In the following years divisions of his industrial army were found in almost every country in Europe, in India, in Australia, and in South America. It must be remembered that, besides actual railway works, he originated and maintained a great number of subordinate assistant establishments, coal and iron-works, dockyards, &c., the direction of which alone would be sufficient to strain the energies of a common mind. His profits were, of course, enormous, but prosperity did not intoxicate him; and when heavy losses came, as sometimes they did, he took them bravely and quietly. Among the greatest of his pecuniary disasters were those caused by the fall of the great Barentin viaduct on the Rouen and Havre railway, and by the failure of Peto and Betts. Brassey was one of the first to aim at improving the relations between engineers and contractors, by setting himself against the corrupt practices which were common. He resolutely resisted the “scamping” of work and the bribery of inspectors, and effected what he called the “smothering of the engineer” by destroying the power of the inspectors and preventing all just grounds of dissatisfaction. Large hearted and generous to a rare degree, modest and simple in his taste and manners, he was conscious of his power as a leader in his calling, and knew how to use it wisely and for noble ends Honours came to him unsought. The cross of the Legion of Honour was conferred on him. From Victor Emmanuel he received the cross of the Order of St Maurice and St Lazarus; and from the emperor of Austria the decoration of the Iron Crown, which it is said had not before been given to a foreigner. He died at St Leonards at the age of 65, December 8, 1870. His life and labours are commemorated in a small volume published by Sir Arthur Helps in 1872.
