BOSC, Louis Augustine Guillaume, French naturalist, was born at Paris on the 29th January 1759. He was educated at the college of Dijon, and attended the lectures of Durande on botany, which inspired him with a passion for natural history. He followed up his studies at Paris, and was a constant auditor at the Jardin des Plantes. Even when closely occupied in official work, he managed to find time for his favourite researches and contributed many valuable papers to various scientific transactions and reviews. At the age of eighteen he had obtained an appointment under Government, and he rose to be one of the chief officials in the postal department. Under the ministry of Roland he also held the post of superintendent of prisons, but the violent outbreaks of 1793 drove him from office, and compelled him to take refuge in flight. For some months he lay concealed in the forest of Montmorency, barely subsisting on roots and vegetables. He was enabled to return to Paris on the fall of Robespierre, and soon after set out for America, resolving to explore the natural riches of that country. The immense materials he gathered were never published in a complete form, but much went to enrich the works of Lacépède, Latreille, and others. After his return, on the establishment of the Directory, he was reinstated in his old office. Of this he was again deprived by the coup d'état of 1799, and for a time he was in great destitution. He set resolutely to work, however, and by his copious contributions to scientific literature, contrived to support himself and to lay the foundations of a solid reputation. He was engaged on the Supplement to Rozier’s Dictionary, on the new Dictionnaire d’histoire naturelle, and on the Encyclopédie Méthodique. He edited the Dictionnaire raisonné et universal d’agriculture, and was one of the editors of the Annales de l’agriculture Française. His increasing fame brought him manifold employments. He was made inspector of the gardens at Versailles, and of the public nurseries belonging to ministry of the Interior. The last years of his life were devoted to an elaborate work on the vine, for which he had amassed an immense quantity of materials. His death, on the 10th July 1828, prevented the prosecution of this work; and. his notes which still exist are said to be so unsystematic as to be unfit for publication.
