BUGEN HAGEN, Johann (1485-1558), surnamed Pomeranus, a German Reformer, was born at Wollin, in Pomerania, on the 24th June 1485. He was educated at the university of Greifswald, and gained high distinction as a classical scholar. In 1505 he was made rector of a school at Treptow, and was soon afterwards selected by the abbot of a neighbouring convent as one of the lecturers to the monks. In 1520 he received a copy of Luther’s work on the Babylonish captivity, which speedily wrought a change in his views. He warmly embraced the principles of the Reformation, and succeeded in bringing over the aged abbot and several others. He made his way to Wittenberg in the following year, was warmly received by Luther and Melanchthon, and quickly became a foremost man in the Reformation movement. He was specially qualified for organizing the new church, and his activity spread itself over a wide district. In 1528 he arranged the church affairs of Brunswick and Bamburg; in 1530 those of Lubeck and Pomerania. In 1537 he was invited to Denmark by king Christian III., and remained five years in that country, organizing the chuιch and schools. He passed the remainder of his life at Wittenberg, braving all the perils of war and persecution rather than desert the placethat was dear to him as the home of the Reformation. He died on the 20th April 1558. Among his numerous works is a history of Pomerania, which remained unpublished till 1728, Pomerania in IV. Libros Divisa, [9:4:446]
