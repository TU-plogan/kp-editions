BYNG, The Hon. John (1704-1757), British admiral, fourth son of the subject of the preceding notice, entered the navy at an early age, became captain in 1727, and in 1745 was made rear-admiral of the red. In the year 1755 the British Government received intimation that the French were fitting out a naval expedition in Toulon, and it behoved them to attend to the defences of Gibraltar and Minorca. Nothing, however, was done until the intentions of the French were too apparent, and Byng was then entrusted with ten miserably equipped ships of war, and set sail from Spithead on the 7th April 1756. He put in at Gibraltar to receive stores, and there learnt that the French had made good their descent upon Minorca. On the 19 th May he came in sight of St Philip’s, still held by the British, but failed to establish communications with the governor. On the following day he engaged with the French fleet, which was inferior in number of vessels, but vastly superior in armament and equipment. There seems no doubt that the division under Byng’s charge did not second with sufficient eagerness the bold attack made by Admiral West. The action was indecisive, and next morning Byng called a military council, and it was resolved that, under the circumstances, it was hopeless to attempt anything further, and that Minorca must be left to its fate. The fleet returned to Gibraltar. The indignation of the English at the transaction was intense, and the Government took advantage of it to avert from themselves the charge of incapacity. Byng was at once superseded and brought home under arrest. A court-martial on his conduct sat during December 1756 and January 1757, and found that the admiral had not done his utmost to relieve St Philip’s, or to defeat the French fleet, though they fully acquitted him of cowardice or treachery. The only punishment open to them to inflict was that of death, and they passed their sentence with the utmost reluctance, coupling it with an earnest recommendation to mercy. No attention was paid to this or to other attempts to mitigate what was felt to be an unduly severe punishment for mere incapacity.

The unfortunate admiral was shot on the 14 th March 1757.
