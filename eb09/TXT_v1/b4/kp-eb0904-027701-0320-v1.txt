BRIANÇON, a very strongly fortified town of France, the capital of an arrondissement in the department of Hautes-Alpes, situated on a hill about 4300 feet above the level of the sea, near the source of the Durance, in lat. 44° 53' N. and 6° 47' E. long. It commands the road across - Mount Genèvre between France and Italy, and is well defended by its natural position; while the surrounding eminences are crowned with strong fortifications communicating with each other and the town by subterranean passages. The town itself is one of the highest in Europe, and the neighbouring village of St Veran has the loftiest situation of any in France. The principal buildings in Briançon are a church in the Italian style, the departmental prison, and a communal college. A single-arch bridge, 127 feet in span and 180 feet high, crosses the valley of the Clarée, affording access from the town to the principal parts of the fortifications. There is an extensive silk-factory in the old convent of St Catherine, which manufactures floss silk, stockings, hats, and other silk goods; and the other industrial articles in the town comprise small iron wares, leather, and lavender water. A considerable traffic is carried on in chalk, and in turpentine and other forest productions. The chalk, though known as Briançon chalk, is obtained at Fenestrelles in Piedmont; the Briançon manna is a kind of resin. Briançon is identified with Brigantium, a city of great antiquity and dubious origin, which became an important military post under the Romans. For a long time after the fall of the Roman empire it maintained itself as an independent republic, and was not united to France till 1349. Made over by the peace of Ryswick to the duke of Savoy, it was restored to France in 1713. In 1815 the town made a noble defence. Population in 1872, 3579.
