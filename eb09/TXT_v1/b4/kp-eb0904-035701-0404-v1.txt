BROADSTAIRS, a town of England, in the county of Kent, about a mile and a half to the south of the North Foreland, and three miles from Margate, on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway. It has a small pier for fishing-boats—built in the reign of Henry VIII., a modern Gothic church, hotels, libraries, and bathing-establishments; and in the summer season it attracts a considerable number of visitors. There is an archway leading down to the shore, which bears that it was erected by George Culmer in 1540, and not far off is the site of a chapel of the Virgin, to which ships were accustomed to veil their top-sails as they passed. Population in 1871, 1926.
