BRANDY, a spirituous liquor obtained by the distillation of wine, the aroma of which is due to ether and other volatile products. It may be distilled from any wine, but red wines yield a less pure and less aromatic spirit than light coloured varieties. In the departments of Charente and Charente Inférieure a variety of grape is cultivated exclusively for the production of brandy, the yield of which constitutes the cognac of commerce. In portions of the departments of the Landes, Gers, and Lot et Garonne, the preparation of brandy is also an important industry, and the produce is commercially known as armagnac, from the name of the district. The cognac district which produces the most rich and delicate spirit distilled is separated into distinct zones of production, according to the quality of the spirit each yields. In the centre of the district on the left bank of the Charente is the Grande Champagne, and radiating beyond it are the Petite Champagne, the Premiers Bois, and the Seconds Bois successively. The Grande Champagne is the source of the finest brandy anywhere produced; and as the area of cultivation recedes from that centre, the quality of the spirit proportionately lessens. The quantity of brandy exported in 1868 from Tonnay Charente was 9,187,416 gallons, valued at £1,887,678, the greater part of which was consigned to British ports; but the exports fluctuate greatly according to the character of the years. Thus in 1872 the total imports to Great Britain were only 3,505,295 gallons, while in 1873 the quantity was 6,483,486 gallons, of which 6,378,398 gallons came from France. By storage in oak casks the spirit takes up a portion of tannin, which gives it a delicate golden hue, but the deeper colour of brown brandy is communicated by caramel. Cognac is kept in carefully ventilated stores for two years, during which time it decreases in bulk and strength by evaporation, but mellows and develops aroma which continues to increase the longer it is kept. Brandy is very popular as a medicinal stimulant, and for use in cases of sickness, diarrhoea, and spasms. It is very often adulterated, and a vast amount of spirit which passes under the name is really either beetroot spirit or grain whisky coloured and aromatized with the cognac-flavoured oenanthic ether or Hungarian oil. See Distillation.
