BROWN, John, an American abolitionist, celebrated as the originator of the Harper’s Ferry insurrection, was born in Torrington, Connecticut, on the 9th May 1800. Originally intended for the church, he was compelled to give up study for this purpose on account of inflammation in the eyes. He then took up the business of a tanner, which he carried on for twenty years. Not being very successful in trade, he started business as a wool-dealer in Ohio in 1840. Failing also in this he removed to Essex county, New York, in 1849, and began to reclaim a large tract of land which had been granted to him. After two years he returned to Ohio and resumed his business as a wool-dealer. In 1855, with his four sons, he migrated to Kansas, and at once took a prominent position as an anti-slavery man. He became renowned in the fierce border warfare which was carried on for some years in Kansas and Missouri, and gained particular celebrity by his victory at Ossowattomie. About this time he seems to have formed the idea of effecting slave liberation by arming the slaves and inciting them to rise in revolt against their oppressors. As the first step in this scheme, he designed to seize the arsenal of Harper’s Ferry, where an immense stock of arms was kept. On the night of the 10th October 1859, he, with a handful of well-armed and resolute companions, overpowered the small guard and gained possession of the arsenal. During the next morning he made prisoners of some of the chief men of the town, but there was no rising of slaves as had been expected. The townsmen, too, recovered from their astonishment at the audacity of the act, and a bold attack was made on the arsenal. Fresh assailants poured in from the country round, and on the morning of the 18th the arsenal was recaptured, and Brown, severely wounded, was taken prisoner. On the 27th October he was tried at Charlestown for treason and murder, and was found guilty. The sentence passed upon him, death by hanging, was carried into execution on the 2d December. His fate made an extraordinary impression on the excited feelings of the Americans, and his name has become a household word among the Abolitionists.
