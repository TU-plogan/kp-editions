BUENOS AYRES, the largest and most important province of the Argentine Republic, is bounded on the N. by the Parana, which separates it from the province of Entre Rios, and by the provinces of Santa Fé, Cordova, and San Luis; on the E. by the Atlantic; on the S. by Patagonia; and on the S. and W. by the country of the Indians, which extends westwards to the Andes. The area of the province is estimated at about 440,000 square miles. Its seaboard along the Rio de la Plata and the ocean is upwards of 900 miles in length. According to the last census of 1869 the population was 488,706, of which 171,404 belong to the city of Buenos Ayres; in the present year (1876) it may be estimated at 600,000, of which 220,000 belong to the city, and 380,000 to the province. By the last returns the number of immigrants is from 60,000 to 90,000 per annum, the greater part of whom remain in the province of Buenos Ayres.

The general aspect of the country, as viewed from the sea, is eminently uninteresting. From the mouth of the Plata to the Bahia Blanca the sea-line presents an unbroken series of sand-dunes, varied here and there with low ridges of rock. From this latter point to the Patagonian frontier, the aspect of the coast is less monotonous, though equally destitute of life or interest. Though Buenos Ayres is the only province of the Argentine Republic that borders upon the sea, and though all the exports and imports of the country pass through it, it possesses very few harbours. One of these (that of the city of Buenos Ayres) is extremely bad; another (that of Bahia Blanca, near the southern [9:4:440] extremity of the province), possesses great natural advantages, which are by no means adequately appreciated. It might be turned to good account as a starting-point for vessels engaged in trade with the South American states that border upon the Pacific, but the difficult and sometimes dangerous navigation of the adjoining seas counterbalances in the meantime the other advantages which it offers. The interior of the couutry, except where it is intersected by the low mountain ranges of the Ventana and Vaulcan in its southern portions, and the spurs of the Andes in the west, is one vast plain, of which by far the larger part is laid out in estancias, or cattle farms, though the soil is in itself well adapted for producing all the European cerealia. Agricultural pursuits, however, are by no means in favour with the natives, who cannot bring themselves to engage in any pursuit that cannot be prosecuted on horseback. “Every man, woman, and child in the country rides,” says Parish. “One might fancy one’s self in the land of centaurs, amidst a population half-men, half-horses. Even beggars ride on horseback.” Some of the cattle-farms are of immense extent; one in particular is mentioned by travellers as comprising more than 300 square miles of land, and yielding an enormous revenue to the proprietor. Some of the largest of them belong to British settlers, and are worked by British servants. The cattle were formerly hunted down and killed merely for the sake of their hides and tongues, while the carcases were abandoned to beasts and birds of prey. They are now slaughtered in abattoirs, where every part of the animal is made available. The beef Î3 salted for exportation; the tallow is boiled down, and now forms an important item in the farmer’s revenue; and the trade in hides is steadily increasing. Beef and an infusion of the native tea are the staple food of the natives. In the province of Buenos Ayres there are 45,500,000 sheep, which give a yield of 136,500,000 lb unwashed wool; 5,116,000 cows; and 1,500,000 horses. This give3 the unusual average of 200 sheep, 20 cows, and 6 horses to every inhabitant. The sheep-farms cover over 40,000,000 acres; and the number of shepherds may be estimated at 30,000, of whom at least a quarter are Irish or Scotch. The total value of exports from Buenos Ayres in 1872 was £9,148,638,—the most important being wool 203,610,000 lb, sheep-skins 72,970,000 lb, ox and cow-hides 3,121,758, jerked beef 916,220 qq., tallow 1,182,240 qq. The value of imports in 1872 may be stated approximately at £12,000,000, of which Great Britain contributed £3,800,000, France £3,200,000, Spain £800,000, Brazil £700,000, United States £700,000, Italy £600,000, Belgium £600,000, Germany £100,000, other countries £1,200,000.

Of the cereals grown in Buenos Ayres the most important is maize, which is indigenous to the country, Wheat thrives well in the southern parts of the province, but the inhabitants rarely grow more than enough to supply their own necessities. In the event of a surplus it is commonly exported to Brazil. The vine, fig, orange, and olive have been introduced from the Old World, and are found to suit the climate admirably; but the most valuable of European fruits is the peach. A considerable fruit trade is carried on in coasting vessels by merchants for the most part Italian or French,

The geographical position of Buenos Ayres is such as to enable it completely to control the foreign commercial relations of the entire republic of which it forms a part. The exclusive policy which it has always pursued on this point has often involved it in serious quarrels, not only with many of the South American states and the other provinces of the Argentine Republic, but with England and France. Since the expulsion of General Rosas, the navigation of the Parana and Uruguay has been thrown open, and other measures have been taken to place both the province and city of Buenos Ayres on a level with the other provinces of the republic.

The only towns of any importance, besides the capital, are San Nicolas, which is situated on the Parana, about 200 miles N.W. of Buenos Ayres, and contains a population of about 10,000; San Pedro, also on the Parana, about 150 miles from the capital, in the same direction, with a population of 1000; Chascomus, on a lake of the same name, a place of considerable importance; Dolores, 150 miles south of Buenos Ayres; Villa de Mercedes, Chivilcoy, Las Flores, and Belgrano.

Buenos Ayres, the capital of the Argentine Republic and of the province of Buenos Ayres, is situated on the right bank of the estuary of the La Plata, in 34° 39' S. lat. and 58° 18' W. long. The river is at this point so wide that it is quite impossible with the naked eye to distinguish the opposite bank, and at the same time so shallow, that ships drawing 15 or 16 feet of water must anchor seven or eight miles from the city. Small craft generally anchor in what are called the inner roads, abreast of the city. The depth of water is never sufficient to admit of their coming to shore.

The town of Buenos Ayres is situated in a vast plain extending westwards to the Andes. The level uniformity of its outline is only broken by the spires of the various churches. The stranger, on landing, is struck with the [9:4:441] regularity of the streets, which are quite straight, and intersect each other at distances of 150 yards, forming squares like those of a chess-board, with the cleanly appearance of the houses, and the general air of independence that distinguishes the inhabitants. The houses till lately had never more than two stories, and commonly only one, the rooms of which open into each other, and were chiefly supplied with furniture of a very inferior description from the United States. A chimney was a thing unknown, and the old Spanish brazero alone was employed in heating the damp and white washed rooms. A great change has, however, taken place in these respects within the last few years. A rage for building has prevailed, and now splendid edifices of three and four stories may be seen in every street. The furniture is now supplied from Europe, the walls are papered, grates and chimneys have come into fashion, and English coal is burned. These comforts are all the more valuable, as the climate of Buenos Ayres is one of the most humid and changeable in the world. The streets of the city are now tolerably paved with granite. They exceed eighty in number, thirty-one of them running from the river side due west, and fifty-one from north to south. The city is being provided with drainage and water supply, and is well lighted with gas. There are eleven parishes, containing sixteen Roman Catholic churches. There are two city hospitals, supported by the municipality, and four for foreigners, belonging to the English, French, Italian, and Irish communities. The theatres are five in number, and there is also a concert-hall. Five markets for the daily supply of the city with provisions are placed at convenient distances; and the plazas “11 de Setiembre” and a Constitution,” are the great wool markets for the north and south districts of the camp. Floriculture is a favourite pursuit; and many English and Scotch gardeners have nurseries in the neighbourhood of the town.

Of the public buildings may be noticed the Government house, which is situated on the beach, a residence for the president of the Republic; the cathedral, which is surmounted by a handsome dome, and has a large portico with twelve Corinthian pillars; the cabildo or town-house, in which justice is administered; the churches of La Merced, San Francisco, and San Domingo; and the custom-house. The Plaza de la Victoria, round which some of these edifices are grouped, is the handsomest square in Buenos Ayres. In the centre of it is a handsome monument, erected as a memorial of the War of Independence. When the number of British residents in the town began rapidly to increase application was made to General Rosas for a site for a church. This was immediately granted, and the minister for the time being set an example of liberality and toleration to his countrymen by laying the foundation-stone of the edifice, which cost in all about £4000, half of which was defrayed by the British Government. The Scottish residents have built a small Presbyterian chapel, and the Roman Catholic portion of the English subjects are allowed the use of one of the national churches, in which a priest performs the service. In 1842 the Methodists erected a meeting-house, which is used by all denominations of the British Dissenters. The Protestant Germans, who are pretty numerous, have a church in connection with the Established Church of Prussia. To each of these places of worship schools are attached for children of both sexes. The facilities for education are very considerable, and of these the inhabitants avail themselves extensively. Besides the denominational schools already alluded to, there is a university, attended by about 500 students, and possessing a valuable library. The sons of the wealthier families of the city are very frequently sent to Europe to complete their education at some of the great schools and colleges in France and England. The Buenos Ayreans inherit from their ancestors much of that passion for music which characterizes the Spaniard. Poetry also is much cultivated among them. Besides its university, Buenos Ayres contains many literary and scientific institutions. Of these the most important are the school of medicine, the academy of jurisprudence, a special academy of mathematics and the physical sciences, a normal school, and a society for the promotion of agriculture. The charitable societies, though not very numerous, are rather important. Spanish is the language spoken by the Buenos Ayrean descendants of the old Spanish settlers.

Buenos Ayres was founded in 1535 by a Spanish expedition under Don Jorge de Mendoza, who landing at this place after many hardships, bestowed upon it the name it now bears in commemoration of the fine weather which prevailed at that time. At first he endeavoured to conciliate the native Indians, but hostilities soon broke out, and, despite their utmost efforts, the Spaniards were obliged to abandon the new settlement; and after almost incredible difficulties succeeded in reaching Asuncion in Paraguay, with their numbers reduced by three-fourths. In 1580 another expedition under Don Juan de Garay took possession of the site of the old fort and established themselves there, founding cities and establishing settlements in every direction with such success that in 1620 a new government was erected, under the name of the government of the Rio de la Plata. Buenos Ayres became the capital, and the seat of a new bishopric created at this time by Pope Paul V., at the request of Philip HI. of Spain. After the lapse of a century, Buenos Ayres began to rise into such importance as to excite the jealousy and alarm of the home Government. The insane restrictions imposed upon her foreign and internal commerce led only to continual heart-burnings with the parent country, and Buenos Ayres soon became a rendezvous for the smugglers of such nations as were strong enough to set Spain at defiance. After numerous modifications of its government, and of its relations to the parent state, the provinces of the Rio de la Plata were in 1776 erected into a vice-royalty, of which Buenos Ayres continued to be the capital. Two years later the old commercial restrictions were abolished and a new commercial code promulgated, so liberal as to be called the “Free-Trade Regulations.” According to the old system the Buenos Ayreans were only allowed to export merchandise to the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, and the quantity was limited to 2000 fanegas of wheat, 500 quintals of jerked beef, and 500 of tallow. All intercourse with other countries was strictly prohibited. By the new system, nine ports in Spain, and twenty-four in the colonies were declared pτιertos habilitados, or ports of entry. The effects of the new policy was immediately visible. Of hides, for instance, the staple commodity of the country, the exports to Spain before 1778 only amounted to 150,000 annually; after that year they rose to from 700,000 to 800,000. - In 1805, and again in 1807, the British invaded Buenos Ayres; and though the natives applied for assistance to the home authorities, they were told that they must defend themselves as they best might, as Spain could send them no help. They accordingly rose in arms, and twice expelled the invaders. In the following year they were threatened with invasion by the prince regent of Portugal. The resolution which they displayed on the occasion prevented that prince from insisting upon his claims. In 1810 the circumstances of the country involved the establishment of a provisional junta,— a policy which was construed by the Spanish Cortes into an act of rebellion. A civil war ensued; and Ferdinand, on his restoration after the expulsion of the French from Spain, instead of trying to conciliate the malcontents by timely concessions, obstinately refused to accede to their lawful demands. The result of this was that, on the 9th of July 1816, deputies from the provinces of the Rio de la Plata assembled in congress at Tucuman, solemnly declared their separation from Spain, and their determination to constitute a free and independent state. Buenos Ayres continued to be the capital of the new republic, which was governed by authorities constituted in that city. The exclusive policy of the capital soon bred discontent in the provinces, the governors of which began to cry out for a federation in opposition to the Central Government of Buenos Ayres. By their influence the new constitution, which conferred on a chief magistrate residing in the capital very extensive civil and military powers over the whole republic, was repudiated, and a civil war was the consequence. Various assemblies were held, and attempts were made to establish the constitution on a sufficiently wide basis to reconcile the interests of all parties—but always without success; and from 1827 till the expulsion of Rosas in 1852, no meetings of the constituent assembly took place. After 1827, the confederation was obliged to delegate to the Executive Government of Buenos Ayres the undivided charge of the national business, such as the management of the public debt, the maintenance of relations with foreign pow ers, [9:4:442] the defence of the country in the event of waι∙, &c. While these internal dissentions were going on, war was declared between the young confederation and the empire of Brazil, and Buenos Ayres was blockaded for a year, and a half by a Brazilian fleet. In 1828, however, the siege was raised by the intervention of the English, and by the decisive battle that took place at Ituzaingo favourable to the Argentine arms. This foreign war thus ended, the civil war broke out once more, and was only temporarily checked by the accession of General Rosas to power in 1835. Aiming at territorial aggrandizement, Rosas soon became involved in war witlι the neighbouring states of Paraguay and Uruguay. England, France, and Brazil interfered, with the intention of effecting an amicable an - ange-ment between the belligerents. Rosas rejected their mediation; and the united fleets of England and France took . possession of the Buenos Ayrean fleet which was engaged in the siege of Monte Video, and opened the navigation of the Parana to the merchantmen of all nations. In the subsequent operations Rosas sustained severe losses, yet obstinately refused to yield. In 1848 the English fleet returned home, and was followed by the French in the following year. Brazil was now left to carry on the war alone, but she found ready allies in some of the provinces of the Argentine Confederation, which had long regarded with hatred and aversion the supremacy arrogated by Buenos Ayres. With the assistance of these and the adjoining states of Uruguay and Paraguay, a large army was raised, which, under the command of General Urquiza, defeated Rosas at the battle of Monte Caseros, February 3, 1852. Rosas after his downfall fled to England. Urquiza was appointed provisional director of the confederation; but the Buenos Ayreans protested against his policy, which threatened to undermine the prerogatives they had been long struggling to secure. Civil war again broke out; and in 1853 Buenos Ayres was besieged by the forces of the other states of the confederation. On the 20th of June the siege was raised, and a temporary accommodation effected.

Since the establishment of the Argentine Republic in 1861 the city and province of Buenos Ayres have both very considerably developed their resources. In the province there are now 450 miles of railway, and 2228 miles of telegraph lines; in the city there are six lines of tramway, which traverse the town in every direction. Most of the railways and three of the tramway Unes belong to English companies. There are thirteen different lines of steamers trading between Europe and the Port of Buenos Ayres. Population (1876) estimated at about 220,000.
