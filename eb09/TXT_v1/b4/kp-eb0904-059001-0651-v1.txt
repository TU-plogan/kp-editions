BUTLER, William Archer (1814-1848), a brilliant writer on theology and the history of philosophy, was born at Annerville, near Clonmel, probably in 1814. His father was a Protestant, his mother a Roman Catholic, and he was brought up in the Romish faith. At the age of nine he was sent to Clonmel school, where he distinguished himself not so much by rigid attention to his class work as by general brilliancy and power. Even when a boy he was strongly drawn towards the imaginative and poetical, and some of his early verses show an astonishing precocity. After leaving Clonmel school he entered Trinity College, Dublin. Two years before he had joined the Protestant church. His career at college was remarkably brilliant. The studies to which he specially devoted himself were the literary and metaphysical; and he was particularly noted for the extreme beauty of his style, both in speaking and in written exercises. In 1834 he gained the ethical moderatorship, newly instituted by Provost Lloyd, and continued in residence at college, pursuing his favourite studies. Many papers were about this time contributed by him to the Dublin University Magazine; it is to be regretted that these have not been collected. In 1837 he made up his mind to enter the church, and in the same year he was elected to the professorship of moral philosophy, specially founded for him through the exertions of Provost Lloyd. About the same time he was presented to the prebend of Clondehorka, in Donegal, and resided there when not called by his professorial duties to Dublin. In 1842 he was promoted to the rectory of Raymoghy. His lectures and his sermons were equally admired for their strength of thought and richly imaginative style. In 1845 appeared in the Irish Ecclesiastical Journal his Letters on Development, written under a great press of business, but in every way worthy of the author, and the best reply made to the famous essay of Newman which had called them forth. Butler’s life was but short. He caught cold when returning one day from public service; the cold terminated in fever, which proved fatal in a few days. He died on the 5th July 1848. His Sermons, published in two vols, by Woodward and Jeremie, have been universally recognized as among the most important recent contributions to theology. They are remarkable not only for rare brilliancy of style, but for subtilty and force of thought. The diction is at times too ornate and rhetorical, but it is not to be forgotten that the sermons were hurriedly written, were never revised, and were all the work of a young man. Their uncommon excellence deepens the regret at the early death of the author. The Lectures on the History of Ancient Philosophy, edited in a masterly manner by W. HepworthThompson(2 vols. 1856; 2d ed.,lvol. 1875), have taken their place as the best among the few British works on the history of philosophy. The introductory lectures, and those on the early Greek thinkers, are not of the highest value, and though they evidence wide reading, do not show the complete mastery over the material that is found in Schwegler or Zeller. The lectures on Plato, however, are of great value, and furnish a most admirable and enthusiastically conceived exposition of the Platonic system. Butler was evidently attracted by the lofty spirit of Platonism, and sets forth its main features with the warmest admiration. In details he is not altogether to be trusted, but any defects in his scholarship are amply supplied in the valuable notes of his editor.
