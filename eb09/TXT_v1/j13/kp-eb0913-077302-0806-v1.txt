JUNÁGARH, a native state in Kâthiàwâr, in the province of Guzerat, Bombay presidency, India, is situated between 20° 48' and 21° 40' N. lat., and between 69° 55' and 71° 35' E. long. The state, which comprises an estimated area of 3800 square miles, consists of a level plain, with the exception of the Girnar group of hills, sacred to Jainism, the highest peak of which rises to about 3500 feet above sea-level. The coast-line is well supplied with fair-weather harbours, of which the chief are Verawâl, Nawabandar, and Sutrapora. The ruined but famous temple of Somnâth is situated in the state. The estimated population in 1872 was 380,921, residing in eight hundred and ninety villages. The principal agricultural products are cotton (largely exported to Bombay for re-export), wheat, pulses and millets, oilseeds, and sugar-cane. The manufactures are oil and coarse cotton cloth. The estimated revenue is £200,000. Junâgarh town, the fortified capital of the state, situated in 21° 31' N. lat., 70° 36' 30" E. long., has an estimated population of 20,025.

Prior to 1746 Junâgarh was a Rajput state ruled by chiefs of the Churâsumâ tribe, but in that year it was conquered by Sultan Muhammad Begâra of Ahmadâbâd. In Akbar’s reign it became a dependency of the court of Delhi, under the immediate authority of the Mughal viceroy of Guzerat. About 1735, when the representative of the Mughals had lost his authority in Guzerat, Sher Khan Bâbi, a soldier of fortune under the viceroy, expelled the Mughal governor and established his own rule. Sher Khân’s son, Salâbat Khan, appointed his heir chief of Junâgarh, assigning to his younger sons the lands of Bântwâ. Though himself tributary to the gâekwâr of Baroda and the British Government, the nawâb of Junâgarh receives yearly contributions, called zortalabi, from a large number of the petty chiefs in Kâthiâwâr. This levy, which is collected and paid to the nawâb by British officers of the Kâthiâwâr agency, is a relic of the days of Mahometan supremacy. Junâgarh ranks as a first class state among the many chiefships of Kâthiâwâr, and its ruler first entered into engagements with the British in 1807.
