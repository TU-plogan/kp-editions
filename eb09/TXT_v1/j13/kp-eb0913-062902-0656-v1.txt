JEREZ DE LOS CABALLEROS, a city in the province of Badajoz, Spain, is picturesquely situated 39 miles to the south of that city, on two heights near the Ardila, a tributary of the Guadiana. The old town is surrounded by a Moorish wall with six gates; the newer portion of the city is well and regularly built, and adorned with numerous orange and other fruit trees. It has linen and woollen manufactures to a limited extent and several tanneries; but its principal articles of trade are the various agricultural and other products of the district, especially the fine quality of pork which is reared in the oak forests of the neighbourhood. The town is said to have been founded by Alphonso IX. of Leon in 1229; in 1232 it was extended by his son Saint Ferdinand, who gave it to the Knights Templars, whence the name de los Caballeros. It was made a city by Charles V. The population in 1877 was 8463.
