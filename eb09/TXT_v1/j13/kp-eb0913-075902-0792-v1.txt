JUBA II., king of Mauretania, was on the death of his father Juba I. in 46 b c. carried to Rome, a mere infant, to grace Caesar’s triumph. He seems to have received a good education under the care of Octavianus (afterwards Augustus), whom he accompanied later in his campaign against Antony. In 29 b.c., after Antony’s death, Octavianus gave the young African the hand of Cleopatra Selene, daughter of Antony and Cleopatra, and placed him on his paternal throne. In 25 B.C., however, he transferred him from Numidia to the kingdoms formerly held by Bocchus and Boguas, viz., Mauretania Tingitana and Mauretania C⅛sariensis, to which was added a part of Gaetulia. Juba fixed his royal residence at Joi, whose name he changed to Caesarea, and which is now identified with the modern Cherchel, about 72 miles west of Algiers. He seems to have reigned in considerable prosperity, though in 6 a.d. the Gaetulians rose in a revolt of sufficient importance to afford the surname Gaetulicus to Cornelius Cossus, the Roman general whose aid the king called in to suppress it. According to Josephus (Ant. xvii. 13, 1 and 4; J3. J., ii. 7, 4), Juba married in second nuptials Glaphyra, daughter of Archelaus of Cappadocia, and widow of Alexander, son of Herod the Great, afterwards wife of Alexander’s brother, the Archelaus of the New Testament. The date of Juba’s death is by no means certain; from the evidence of coins and certain allusions in Strabo, scholars have been led to place it in 19 or 20 a.d.

Juba, to quote the words of Pliny, was more memorable for his writings than for his crown. He wrote many historical and geographical works, of which some seem to have been voluminous and of considerable value on account of the sources to which their author had access. Unfortunately they are known to us only from fragments imbedded in other writers. The list given by C. Müllerin his Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum (vol. iii., Paris, 1849), is as follows:—(1) ’ Pωμαi7c⅛ Ιστορία; (2) ’Ασσυριακά ; (3) Λιβυκά ; (4) Be Arabia sivc Be Expeditione Arabica·, (5) Physiologa; (6) Be Euphorbia herba; (7) ∏epl οποΰ; (8) ∏epl yρaφικns (∏epl ζωγράφων) ; (9) Θeaτp<κ¾ ιστορία; (10) 'θμoιoτητes ; (11) ∏epl φθοράς λlξeωs ; (12) ’Επίγραμμα. Müller (loc. cd.) has collected at the head of Juba’s fragments the scattered notices of the king from the writers of antiquity. See also Sevin in Mérn. de l’Acad. des Inscriptions, vol. iv.
