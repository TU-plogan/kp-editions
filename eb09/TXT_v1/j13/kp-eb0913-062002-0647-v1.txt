JENA, a town in the department of Apolda, in the grand-duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Germany, is situated, about 56 miles south-west of Leipsic by rail, at the junction of the Leutra and Saale, in a beautiful valley, surrounded by romantic hills, and dotted over with villages. The town is tolerably well built, though the houses are quaint, and many of the streets narrow. Besides the university buildings, the more interesting edifices are the 15th century church of St Michael, with a tower 318 feet high, and containing the bronze statue of Luther, originally intended for his tomb; the college-church; the library; the old-fashioned town-house in the market-place; the castle, built in 1620, where Goethe ψrote his Hermann und Dorothea; the Black Bear tavern (now a hotel), where Luther spent the night after his flight from the Wartburg; and Weigel’s house. The career, or students’ prison, ceased to be used for academic discipline in 1880. In 1858, the tercentenary of the inauguration of the university, the various houses in Jena that had been occupied by illustrious men were marked by memorial tablets. Close to the town are the Thuringian district court and the large lunatic asylum—both built in 1879. Of the old fortifications there remain only four towers and an ancient gateway; while the moat has been laid out as a promenade, adorned with busts and statues. On the Hausberg to the east rises the gaunt and legendary Fuchsthurm; and 2 miles to the west, on the Forstberg, is the tower raised to the students of Jena who fell in the war against France, 1870-71. Among the schools are a gymnasium opened in 187 6, and a commercial school. Jena is the seat of an upper appeal court, of a statistical bureau for the Thuringian states, and of a chamber of commerce. The town owes what prosperity it now has to the presence of the university founded by the elector, John Frederick of Saxony, whose statue stands in the marketplace. In 1547 that prince, while a captive in the hands of Charles V., conceived the plan of erecting a university at Jena, in place of that of Wittenberg, which he had forfeited. The academy, founded accordingly at Jena in 1548 by the elector’s three sons, obtained the necessary charter from the emperor Ferdinand I., and on February 2, 1558, was formally inaugurated as a university. The students were most numerous about the middle of the 18th century, when some 3000 attended; but the most brilliant professoriate was under Duke Karl August, Goethe’s patron (1787-1806), when in the different faculties Reinhold, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel, Schlegel, Oken, and Schiller read lectures. Founded as a home for the new religious opinions of the 16th century, Jena has always liberally granted a hearing to new teaching; and it distances perhaps every other German university in the extent to which it carries what are popularly regarded as the characteristics of German student-life,—duelling, and the sentimental passion for Freiheit. At the end of last and the beginning of the present century, the opening of new universities, co-operating with the suspicions of the various German Governments as to the democratic opinions which obtained at Jena, militated against it, and the university has never regained its former prosperity. In the session 1880-81 the teaching-staff numbered 80 members; in the winter session 1879-80 the students numbered 481, and in the summer session 1880, 546. Amongst the numerous auxiliaries of the university may be mentioned the library with 180,000 volumes; the seminaries of philology, theology, and education; the institutes for chemistry, pharmacy, zoology, botany (with a botanical garden), and meteorology (with an observatory in the garden of which a bust of Schiller marks the spot where he wrote his Wallenstein') ; the veterinary and agricultural institutions; and the various physical and archaeological collections, which now occupy the castle. A clinical institute and the several hospitals assist the study of medicine. The Jenaer Literaturzeitung, whose issue in its present form began in 1874 under the patronage of the university, is the ultimate successor of the first Literaturzeitung für Deutschland, which appeared at Jena in 1785. The manufactures of Jena, which are not important, comprise cigars, pianos, cloth, woollens, cement, beer, and sausages. There is some activity in the book-trade and in vine-growing; and the traffic of wood-rafts on the Saale deserves mention. The population in 1875 was 9020.

Jena appears to have possessed town-rights in 1029. At the beginning of the 14th century it was in the possession of the margraves of Meissen, from whom it passed in 1423 to the elector of Saxony. Since 1485 it has remained in the Ernestine line of the house of Saxony. In 1662 it fell to Bernhard, youngest son of the duke of Weimar, and became the capital of a small separate duchy. Bernhard's line having become extinct in 1690, Jena was united with Eisenach, and in 1741 reverted with that duchy to Weimar. In more modern times Jena has been made famous by the defeat inflicted in the vicinity, on October 14, 1806, by Napoleon upon the Prussian army under the duke of Brunswick
