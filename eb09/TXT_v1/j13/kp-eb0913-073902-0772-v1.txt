JONES, Owen (1809-1874), architect and art-decorator, son of the subject of last notice, was born in London in 1809. After an apprenticeship of six years in an architect’s office, he travelled for four years in Italy, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, and Spain, making a special study of the Alhambra in the last-mentioned country. On his return to England in 1836 he busied himself in his professional work. His forte was interior decoration, for which his formula was— “form without colour is like a body without a soul.” He was one of the superintendents of works for the Exhibition of 1851; and, as director of decorations for the Crystal Palace at Sydenham, he arranged the Egyptian, Greek, Roman, and Alhambra courts, besides being responsible for the general decoration of the whole building. ' Along with Mr (afterwards Sir Digby) Wyatt, Jones collected the casts of works of art on the Continent which adorn the different courts, In his later years he was much engaged in the decoration of private houses, among which may be reckoned the viceroy of Egypt’s palace at Gesch. In 1857 he received the royal medal for architecture; and after other distinctions, he was awarded a diploma of honour at the Vienna Exhibition of 1873. He died in London, April 19, 1874.

Owen Jones is described in Thé Builder for 1874 as “the most potent anostle of colour that architectural England has had in these days/’ His range of activity is to be traced in his works: Plans, Elevations, and Details of the Alhambra (1835-45), in which he was assisted by MM. Goury and Gayangos; Designs for Mosaic and Tesselated Pavements, 1842; Polychromatic Ornament of Italy, 1845; An Attempt to define the Principles which regulate the Employment of Colour in Decorative Arts, 1852; Handbook to the Alhambra Court·, Grammar of Ornament, fol., 1856, a very important work; One Thousand and∖One Initial Letters, 1864; Seven Hundred and Two Monograms, 1864; and Examples of Chinese Ornament, 1867.
