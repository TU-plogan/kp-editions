JESUS, the Son of Sirach (Sirachides), the author of the book of Ecclesiasticus, was a native of Jerusalem, of whose personal life, apart from this one fact, vouched for by himself (Ecclus. 1. 27), nothing is known, except that it was devoted to the study of the sacred literature. According to indications contained in chaps, xxxiv. 11, 12, xxxix. 4, 5, li. 1 sq., he seems to have travelled abroad, associated with princes, and once at least been placed in danger of his life by intrigues against him at a royal court. His collection of mord sayings (σοφία Tψroυ υίοΰ Stpαχ, LXX.; Ecclesiasticus, sc. Liber, Vulg.), originally written in Hebrew, and bearing according to Jerome the title of “Proverbs,” was translated into Greek by his grandson, who came to Egypt in the thirty-eighth year of Ptolemy Euergetes (see the Prologue). By this Ptolemy Euergetes we can only understand the second of that name, who began to reign as king of Libya and Cyrene in 170 B.c. Reckoning two generations back from 132 B.c., we reach the high priesthood of Simon II. (219-199 B.c.), to whom, and not to Simon I., the eulogy spoken in Ecclus. 1. is most probably to be assigned. The book was thus originally composed about 180 B.c.
