JONKÖPING, a town of Sweden, at the head of the län of the same name, in 57' 48° N. lat., about 170 miles south-west of Stockholm, and 80 east of Gothenburg. It occupies a beautiful but somewhat unhealthy position in a valley between the southern end of Lake Wetter and two smaller lakes known as the Rocksjö and the Munksjö; the very names, indeed, of two parts of the town, the Tyska Mad and the Svenska Mad, refer to the time when the site was a marsh and the buildings had to be erected on piles. The church of St Christina, dating from 1649-1673, the supreme court (built as a private enterprise in 1665), the town-house (rebuilt after the conflagration of 1691), the buildings of the provincial administration, the artillery barracks, a theatre, and the high school are the more noteworthy edifices. Jönköping is well known as the seat of a great safety-match factory, which produced in 1860 [9:13:741] upwards of 35,000,000 boxes, of the value of <£11,390, while in 1874 the value reached the sum of £150,000. It also contains snuff and cigar factories, an asphalt factory, dye-works, damask factories, and a variety of minor establishments. The population, which has been steadily increasing, numbered 15,037 in 1878.

Jönköping is mentioned as early as 1284 or 1288, and the castle in 1263, when Waldemar Birgersson married the Danish princess Sophia. It was afterwards the scene of many events of moment in Scandinavian history:—the parliaments of 1357, 1439, and 1599; the meeting of the Danish and Swedish plenipotentiaries in 1448; and the death of Sten Stura, the elder, in 1503. In 1612 Gustavus Adolphus caused the inhabitants to destroy their town lest it should fall into the hands of the Danes; but it was rebuilt soon after, and in 1620 received special privileges from the king. It was from the Dutch and German workmen, introduced at this time, that the quarter Tyska Mad received its name. In 1809 the plenipotentiaries of Sweden and Denmark concluded peace in the town.
