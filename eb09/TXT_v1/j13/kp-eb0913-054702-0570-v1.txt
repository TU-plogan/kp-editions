JALÁUN, a British district in the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces of India, lies between 25° 46' and 26° 26' N. lat., and between 78° 59' and 79° 55' E. long., with an area of 1553 square miles, and forms the northern district of the Jhânsi division. It is bounded on the N.E. and N. by the river Jumna, on the W. by the Gwalior and Datia states, on the S. by the Samthar state and the river Betwa, and on the E. by Baoni state. The district lies entirely within the level plain of Bundelkhand, north of the hill country, and is almost surrounded by the Jumna and its tributaries the Betwa and Pahùj. The central region thus enclosed is a dead level of cultivated land, almost destitute of trees, and sparsely dotted with villages. The southern portion especially presents one unbroken sheet of cultivation. The boundary rivers form the only interesting feature in Jaläun. The little river Noh flows through the centre of the district, which it drains by innumerable small ravines instead of watering. Jaläun has little picturesqueness or beauty, but possesses great fertility and abundant agricultural resources.

The census of 1872 gives a population of 404,384, of whom 216,607 were males and 187,777 females. The principal tribes are the Brahmans, the Kurmis, the Gùjars, the Kachhwâhas, the Lengars, the Kayaths, and the Musalmâns. There were four towns in 1872 with a population exceeding 5000 :—Kâlpi, 15,570; Kùnch, 14,448; Jaläun, 10,197; and Urai, 6398. The staple crops arc the cereals, gram, and cotton. Oil-seeds, dye-stuffs, and sugar-cane are also raised, but in no large quantities. Irrigation was employed in 1872 over 19,157 acres. Jaläun has suffered much from the noxious kdns grass, owing to the spread of which many villages have been abandoned and their lands thrown out of cultivation. Drought is the great danger in Jaläun. The last important drought was that of 1868-69; no actual famine resulted, but great distress prevailed. Jaläun is almost entirely an agricultural district, and its trade accordingly depends mainly upon its raw materials and food-stuffs. Kâlpi is the great mart of the district; Kùnch is also a considerable trading town. The river traffic by Kalpi is chiefly for through goods; and the Jumna is little used as a highway. A good commercial road connects Urâi and Jaläun with Phaphund, the railway station on the East Indian line. There is also a great military road from Kalpi to Jhânsi. The administration is on the non-regulation system, which unites civil, criminal, and fiscal functions in the same officer. In 1860 there were 1434 children under instruction; in 1871, 2703. The climate, though hot and dry, is not considered unhealthy. The mean temperature is 81 o- 9 Fahr. The prevailing diseases are fevers, ana dysenteιγ and other bowel complaints.

Jaläun seems to have been subject to the Naga dynasty, which [9:13:548] lasted from the 1st to the 3d century of our era. In course of time the eastern portion fell under the power of the Chandels, while the western districts, including that of JalAun, were ruled by the KachhwAhas, a Rajput clan. These seem to have held most of the district until the invasion of the Bundelas in the 14th century. But the town of KAlpi on the Jumna was conquered for the princes of Ghor as early as 1196. Early in the 14th century the Bundelas occupied the greater part of JalAun, and even succeeded in holding the fortified post of KAlpi. That important possession was soon recovered by the Musalmans, and passed under the sway of the Mughal emperors. Akbar’s governors at KAlpi maintained a nominal authority over the surrounding district; and the native princes were in a state of chronic revolt, which culminated in the war of independence under Chhatar Sal. On the outbreak of his rebellion in 1671 he occupied a large province to the south of the Jumna. Setting out from this basis, and assisted by the MarhattAs, he reduced the whole of Bundelkhand. On his death he bequeathed one-third of his dominions to his Marhatta allies, who displayed their usual alacrity in occupying their new territory, and before long succeeded in quietly annexing the whole of Bundelkhand. Under Marhatta rule the country was a prey to constant anarchy and intestine strife. To this period must be traced the origin of all the poverty and desolation which are still conspicuous throughout the district. In 1806 KAlpi was made over to the British, and in 1840, on the death of Nana Gobind RAs, his possessions lapsed to them also. Various interchanges of territory took place, and in 1856 the present boundaries were substantially settled. During the whole period of British rule before the mutiny, JalAun only recovered its prosperity by very slow degrees. When the news of the rising at Cawnpur reached KAlpi, the men of the 53d native infantry deserted their officers, and in June the JhAιιsi mutineers reached the district, and began their murder of Europeans. The natives everywhere revelled in the licence of plunder and murder which the mutiny had spread through all Bundelkhand, and it was not till September 1858 that the rebels were finally defeated. Since the mutiny the condition of Jalaun seems to have been steadily but slowly improving.

JalAun, a decayed town in the above district, and the former capital of a native state, is situated in 26° 8' 32" N. lat,, 79° 22' 24" E. long. It occupies a large area, and contains a considerable number of good houses, and a ruined fort. The position is low, and swamps surrounding the town engender cholera and malarious fever, for which reason the headquarters of the district have been fixed at Urâi. The population in 1872 was 10,197,—8824 Hindus and 1373 Mahometans.
