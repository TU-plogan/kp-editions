JOHN VI. (1332-1391), Palaeologus, emperor of Constantinople, born in 1332, was the son of Andronicus III., whom he succeeded in 1341. From 1342 John Cantacuzenus shared the throne with him, till on the abdication of his colleague, who had been virtually the sovereign, he became sole emperor in 1334. His reign was marked by the gradual dissolution of the imperial power through the rebellion of his son Andronicus and the encroachments of the Ottomans, to whom in 1381 John acknowledged himself tributary.
