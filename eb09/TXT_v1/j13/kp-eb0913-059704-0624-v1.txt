JAUBERT, Pierre Amédée Émilien Probe (1779- 1847), French Orientalist, was born at Aix in Provence, June 3, 1779. He was one of the most distinguished pupils of the Orientalist Silvestre de Sacy, whose funeral Discours he pronounced in 1838. Jaubert acted as interpreter to Napoleon in Egypt in 1798-99, and on his return to Paris held various posts under Government. In 1802 he accompanied Sebastiani on his Eastern mission; and in 1804 he was with General Brune at Constantinople. Next year he was despatched to Persia to arrange an [9:13:598] alliance with the shah; but on the way he was seized and imprisoned in a dry cistern for four months by the pasha of Bayazid. The pasha’s death freed Jaubert, who successfully accomplished his mission, and rejoined Napoleon at Warsaw in 1807. In 1818 he undertook a journey with Government aid to Tibet, whence he succeeded in introducing into France 400 Cashmere goats. The rest of his life Jaubert spent in study, in writing, and in teaching. He became professor of Persian in the Collége de France, and in 1830 was elected member of the Académie des Inscriptions. In 1841 his erudite services were still further rewarded by admission to the peerage of France, and by the rank of counsellor of state. He died at Paris, January 27, 1847.

Besides articles in the Journal Asiatique, we have from Jaubert Voyage en Arménie et en Perse, fait dans les années 1805-6, 1821 (the edition of 1860 has a notice of Jaubert, by Μ. Sédillot); Éléments de la Grammaire Turque, 1823; Géographie d ’ Edrisi, 1824; Vie de Djenghiz Khan, 1841; and Relation de Γambas-sade de Mohammed Seid Wahid Effendi {Texte Turqτιe), 1843. He also revised MeyendorfΓs Voyage d’Orenbourg à Boukhara, 1826; and abridged Venture’s “Grammaire et Dictionnaire de la langue Berbère,” 1824 (in Recueil de Voyages de la Société de Géographie, tome vii.). See notices in the Journal Asiatique, January 1847, and the Journal des Débats, January 30, 1847.
