JAMES I. (1394-1437), king of Scotland, third son of Robert III. and of Annabella Drummond of Stobhall, was born at Dunfermline in 1394. A second son, John, did not survive infancy. David, duke of Rothesay, the eldest son, had died under suspicious circumstances while committed to the care of the king’s brother the duke of Albany, to whom had also been delegated the virtual government of the kingdom; and the king, in order tα secure the safety of the surviving son, resolved in 1405 to place him under the protection of the king of France. The prince, however, on his way thither fell into the hands of the English, and Henry IV. determined not to admit him to ransom. On the death of his father, April 13, 1406, James became nominal sovereign, but, as he was still retained in captivity in England, the duke of Albany continued regent, and was succeeded, on his death in 1419, by his son Murdock At first James was confined in the Tower of London, but in 1407 he was removed to the castle of Nottingham, where he enjoyed as much liberty as was compatible with detention, and was treated in all respects by his governor, Sir John Pelham, as a member of the household. The physical and intellectual training begun at St Andrews under Bishop Wardlaw was completed by the most accomplished tutors, so that he not only attained to high proficiency in all kinds of manly sports, but reached perhaps a more varied and thorough culture than any of his contemporaries. His figure was not much if at all above the middle height, and, though thickset, was finely proportioned. His agility was no less remarkable than his strength; he not only excelled in throwing the hammer and putting the stone, but in all kinds of athletic feats demanding suppleness of limb and quickness of eye. As regards his intellectual attainments he is reputed to have been well acquainted with philosophy, and it is evident from his subsequent procedure as a sovereign that he had made a special study of jurisprudence; while, besides being a proficient in instrumental and vocal music, he cultivated the art of poetry with a success not surpassed by any previous English writers with the exception of his models Gower and Chaucer. Henry V., on succeeding his father in 14137 removed James to close confinement in the Tower, but shortly afterwards took him to Windsor, and in 1417, with the view of detaching the Scotch auxiliaries from the French standard, invited him to accompany him in his expedition against France. From this time, and especially after the death of the duke of Albany in 1419, James was treated with much consideration; and, having given a pledge of his friendly intentions towards England by his marriage with Lady Jane Beaufort, February 2, 1424, he finally obtained his release in the end of March of the same year, the Scottish nation agreeing to pay a ransom of £40,000». in name of expenses for his maintenance while in captivity.

With the reign of James L, whose coronation took place at Scone on the 21st May, may almost be said to begin the substitution in Scotland of constitutional sovereignty, regulated by definite principles and laws and modified by a regard to the opinions and interests of the subjects, for the indefinite authority of the king and the arbitrary rule of the nobles. It is true that after his death the lawless contests of the nobles broke out as fiercely as ever, but by his energetic repression of their violence during his lifetime, and more especially by the virtual creation of statute law modelled on that of England, and the additional importance assigned to parliament, the leaven was partly prepared which was to work towards the destruction of their unlicensed influence. During a session of the parliament held at Perth on the 12th March 1425, James suddenly arrested a large number of the nobles, including the duke of Albany and his two sons, whom along with the earl of Lennox he caused to be executed. With similar strategy he at a parliament held at Inverness in 1427 arrested Donald of the Isles and fifty of his chiefs. Donald, however, on making all due submission, received his liberty; but when, in violation of his oath he made an abortive attempt to assert his independence, the king, on his making unconditional surrender, confined him to Tantallon castle. As was natural, the energetic rule of the king, and especially his stringent coercion of the nobles, aroused a secret purpose of revenge; and, acting on the inspiration of the earl of Athole, uncle of the king, Sir Robert Graham and other accomplices, with a band of three hundred Highlanders, suddenly, on the evening of the 20th or morning of the 21st February 1437, entered the apartment of the king in the priory of the Dominicans at Perth, and stabbed him to death with their daggers.

Although the constitutional reforms introduced by James I., and the general tenor of his reign, showed that in him were united in a rare degree decision in action with far-sighted sagacity, his merits as a statesman have been cast in the shade by his achievements in literature. It is also worthy of mention that it was owing chiefly to his representations when in captivity that the pope was induced to grant a bull for the erection of a university at St Andrews. The Poetical Remains of James I. were first published in 1783, edited by William Tytler. The principal poems of which he is the reputed author are The King's fluair, Christis Kirk on the Grene, and Peblis to the Play, and he also wrote several minor pieces. A manuscript of the King's Q l uair formerly belonging to Selden is preserved in the Bodleian library at Oxford. The poem, which *is divided into seven cantos, and is written in the seven-lined stanzas of Chaucer, was composed during his captivity in England, to celebrate his love for the lady whom he afterwards married. It is allegorical in form and somewhat tedious in its minute description of details, but always preserves a smooth and harmonious versification, while it contains many finely imaginative passages inspired by true and tender feeling, and characterized by a charming simplicity and grace akin to those of his master Chaucer. One reason why many have doubted that James could be the author of Christis Kirk on the Grene is its entire dissimilarity in manner and style to the King's Quair. Pope’s line, “A Scot will fight for Christ’s Kirk o’ the Green” is sarcastic, but undoubtedly chronicles a fact. The poem is a humorous delineation of a phase of Scotch rustic life, and its spirit and graphic vigour are not unworthy of Burns, who indeed has received from it more than one suggestive hint, and in The Holy Fair and The Ordination has imitated its refrain. The oldest evidence for assigning it to James I. is that of the Bannatyne MS. collection made by George Bannatyne in 1568; and, if this evidence is not conclusive for James I., it is so against Janies V., the only other probable author. There is no printed edition earlier than 1663. Since then several separate editions have appeared, and it has also been printed along with The Gaberlunzie Man as the work of James V. That James I. was the author of the poem receives a certain amount of corroboration from its resemblance in subject and style to Peblis to the Play, the first words of which are quoted by John Major in describing a ballad which he attributes to James.

The contemporary authorities on the reign of James I. are principally Wyntoun’s Crοηykil, and Bower’s continuation of Fordun’s Scοtοchrοnicοn. To the succeeding century belong the histories of John Major, Hector Boece,, and Bishop Lesley. The modern histories of Pinkerton, Tytler, and Burton are of course well known. In regard to questions connected with his character as an author, see Sibbald’s Chronicles of Scottish Poetry, Walpole’s Royal and Noble Authors·, Chalmers’s Historic Remains of Scottish Kings·, Tytier’s Scottish Worthies·, Pinkerton’s Ancient Scottish Poems·, Ritson’s Historical Essay on Scottish Song·, Washington Irving’s Sketch Book·, Prescott’s Miscellanies·, and David Irving’s History of Scottish Poetry. An account of the murder of James I., professedly translated from the Latin of John Shirley in 1440, has been published in an Appendix toPinkerton’s History; in vol. ii. of Miscellanea Scotica, Glasgow, 1818; and in Gait’s novel, The Spaewife.
