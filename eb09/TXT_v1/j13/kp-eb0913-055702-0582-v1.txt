JAMES V. (1512-1542), king of Scotland, son of James IV., was born at Linlithgow 10th April 1512, and crowned king at Scone in October 1513. At first the regency was vested in his mother, but after her marriage with the earl of Angus in 1514 the office was transferred by the estates to the duke of Albany. The English forebore to follow up their victory at Flodden, but the close connexion of Albany with France now aroused the jealousyof Henry VIII., and Scotland was continually exposed to more or less serious attacks from the English until Albany, to whose arrogant bearing and French manners and habits not even the enmity against him of Henry could reconcile the estates, finally in 1524 took his departure to the country of his choice. Upon this James, through the scheming of Henry, was “erected” king in the Tolbooth of Edinburgh, ruling the kingdom by the advice of his mother and the lords in council. In 1526 James was persuaded to choose as his governor the earl of Angus, who kept him in close confinement until May 1528, when he made his escape from Falkland, and put such vigorous measures in execution against Angus as compelled him to flee to England. In 1532 Angus, taking advantage of the discontent in the south of Scotland caused by the king’s conduct towards the Armstrongs, and of the distracted condition of the Highlands, aided an English raid on the borders; but shortly afterwards negotiations for peace were begun, and a treaty was finally signed in 1534. In January 1537 James was married to Madeleine of France, but, she dying in July of the same year, he in June 1538 espoused Mary of Lorraine. Henry VIII. was by no means satisfied with the influence he exercised in Scotch affairs, or the amount of deference he received from his nephew; and, his jealousy receiving special provocation from the interest taken by James in foreign politics, he in 1542 despatched an expedition against Scotland, which failed from want of a commissariat. James determined to make reprisals, but owing to the indecision of the nobles, who had no love of the enterprise, his army was scattered at the rout of Solway Moss on the 25th November. On the 14th December following James died at Falkland. His successor was his daughter Mary, born seven days before his death. Though possessing a weak constitution which was further impaired by his irregular manner of life, James manifested great vigour and independence as a sovereign, both in withstanding the machinations of his uncle and opposing the influence of the nobles. The persecutions to which the Protestants were exposed during his reign were, however, due to the excessive influence exercised by the ecclesiastics, especially David Beaton, archbishop of St Andrews. The king’s habit of mingling with the peasantry secured him a large amount of popularity, and has led many to ascribe to him the authorship of three poems descriptive of scenes in lower class life— Christis Kirk on the Grene, The Gaberlunzie Man, and The Jolly Beggar. There is no proof that he was the author of any of these poems, but from expressions in the poems of Sir David Lyndsay, who was on terms of special intimacy with him, it would appear that he occasionally wrote verses.
