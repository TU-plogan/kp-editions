+=====================================================================+


JANIN, Jules Gabriel (1804-1874), a remarkable instance of a certain kind of critic, was born at St Étienne, the great manufacturing town of the department of the Loire, on December 24, 1804, and died at his house near [9:13:565] Paris in June 1874. His father was a lawyer, and he was well educated, first at St Étienne, and then at the famous Collège Louis-le-Grand at Paris. He betook himself to journalism very early, and worked on different papers, the Figaro, the Quotidienne, &c., until in 1836 he fixed himself as dramatic critic of the Debats. Long before this, however, he had made a considerable a literary reputation, for which indeed his strange novel L’Ane Mort et la Femme Guillotinée (1829) would have sufficed. La Confession, which followed, was less remarkable in substance but even more so in style; and Barnave, in 1831, sustained the literary reputation of the author, though the violent attacks it contained on the Orleans family did not, when they were taken with his subsequent conduct, increase his reputation for consistency. From the day, however, when Janin became the theatrical critic of the Debats, though he continued to write books indefatigably, he was to most Frenchmen a dramatic critic and nothing more. His system was odd enough. He called himself “prince of critics,” a self-presented testimonial in which the mixture of irony and vanity (in all senses of the word) which marked all his work may be detected. He was outrageously inconsistent, and judged things from no general point of view whatsoever, though at least latterly his judgment was usually good-natured. But few journalists have ever been misters of a more attractive fashion of saying the first thing that came into their heads, and if he had called himself a prince of journalists he would not have been far wrong. After many years of feuilleton writing he collected some of his articles in the work called Histoire de la littérature dramatique, which, as may be gathered from what has been said, by no means deserves the title. In 1865 he made his first attempt upon the Academy, but was not successful till five years later. Meanwhile he had not been content with his feuilletons, written persistently about all manner of things. No one was more in request with the Paris publishers for prefaces, letterpress to illustrated books, and all the other hackwork which usually engages in France men of letters of a somewhat higher class than those who generally devote themselves to it in England. He travelled (picking up in one of his journeys a curious windfall, a country house at Lucca, which fell to him in a lottery), and wrote accounts of his travels; he wrote numerous tales and novels, for the titles of which we have no space here, and composed many other works, of which by far the best is the oddly entitled Fin Tun Monde et du Neveu de Rameau, in which, under the guise of a sequel to Diderot’s masterpiece, he showed to considerable advantage his great familiarity with the late 18th century. He married in 1841; his wife had money, and he was always in easy circumstances. In the early part of his career he had many quarrels, notably one with Felix Pyat, but latterly, partly owing to his critical authority and partly to his good temper and hospitality, he was a very popular man with his craft, and at his death his library was said to contain the greatest number of gift and dedication copies of contemporary works that had ever been brought to the hammer. Even in the few years since his death, however, his reputation has rapidly faded, and except with those who know how to look at literature in the largest and most tolerant way, it is not likely to revive. His Âne Mort is really a most remarkable book. Written half in parody, half in deliberate pursuance of the romantic ideas, it anticipated by fifty years in point of time and far excelled in point of literary value the recent performances of the naturalist school. Those who wish to know what Janin might have been should read this, Barnave, and the Fin Tun Monde. But for the most part his work is mere improvisation, and has no elements of vitality in it except a light and vivid style.
