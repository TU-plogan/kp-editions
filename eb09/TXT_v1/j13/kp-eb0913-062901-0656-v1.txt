JEREZ DE LA FRONTERA, a city in the province of Cadiz, Spain, near the right bank of the Guadalete, 16 miles N.N.E. of Cadiz (28 by rail), and 67 S.S.E. of Seville. It is pleasantly situated on an undulating plain of much fertility, and covers a considerable extent of ground. The old crenated Moorish wall by which it was formerly surrounded, but which it has now quite outgrown, still partially exists, as also do some of the ancient gateways. The newer portions of the town are well built, having broad regular streets with numerous “plazas” or squares adorned with fruit trees. The principal buildings are the Alcazar, an old palace fortress belonging to the Moorish period, adjoining the modern “alameda” or promenade; the collegiate church (1695), which, however, though large, presents no attractive architectural features; and the municipal buildings, belonging to the end of the 16th century, which display considerable taste. There are numerous other churches, a theatre, an orphanage, four hospitals, an “institute,” a library, and various schools. The bull ring (1875) is a large one, and enjoys a good repute in Andalusia. ' The staple article of trade is the wine grown in the neighbourhood, known from the name of the town as “sherris” (xeres) or sherry, of which in 1876 a total of 4,607,550 imperial gallons was exported. Of these Great Britain and Ireland took 4,024,114, British colonies 51,122, and other parts of the world 532,314. The population in 1877 was 64,533.

Jerez has sometimes been identified with the ancient Asia Regia, but is most probably the Aside (“quae Caesariana ”) of Pliny. The Shcrish of the Arabs is said to have been a corruption from Caesaris Asido. It was in this neighbourhood that the decisive battle of the Guadalete (July 711) was fought which practically made Tarik master of the entire Pyrenaean peninsula. Jerez, which is frequently mentioned in the chronicles of the Spanish Arabs, was recovered by Alphonso the Wise in 1255.
