JESSOR, or Jessore, a British district in the lieutenantgovernorship of Bengal, lying between 22° 25' 50" and 23° 47' N. lat., and between 88° 57' 33" and 90° 0' 13" E. long., with an area (1878) of 3658 square miles, forms the eastern portion of the presidency division. It is bounded on the N. and W. by Nadiyâ district, on the S. by the Sundarbans, and on the E. by the district of Faridpur.

Jessor forms the central portion of the delta between the Hooghly and the united Ganges and Brahmaputra. It is a vast alluvial plain intersected by rivers and watercourses, which at places in the southern portion of the district spread out into large marshes. The northern part of the district is verdant, with extensive groves of date-palms; villages are numerous and large; and the people are prosperous. In the central portion the population is sparse, the only part of the tract suitable for dwellings being the high land ∣>n the banks of rivers. The principal rivers of Jessor are the Madhumati (which forms the eastern boundary of the district), with its tributaries the Nabagangâ, Chitra, and Bhairab; the Kumar, Kabadak, Katki, Harihar, Bhadrâ, and Athârâbânkâ. Within the last century the rivers in the interior of Jessor have ceased to be true deltaic rivers; and, whereas the northern portion of the district formerly lay under water for several months every year, it is now reached only by unusual inundations. The tide reaches as far north as the latitude of Jessor town.

The population of Jessor in 1872 numbered 2,075,021, of whom 1,051,126 were males and 1,023,895 females. The inhabitants of the district are all Bengalis; the better classes are Hindus, the lower orders being principally Mahometans. The Hindus number 915,413, the Musalmâns 1,151,936, and the Christians 1142. The Brahma Samâj has a few adherents. Among the lower ranks, the fishing and boating castes deserve attention, the fisheries in the rivers and deeper swamps being very valuable, and the right to fish being a regular tenure paid for like the right to cultivate land. Jessor is noted for a colony of pure Kulin Brahmans, who live at Lakshmipâsâ, a village on the Nabagangâ. These Kulins trace their origin to Ramânand Chakrabartti, who five generations ago emigrated from Sarmangal in Bâkarganj, a great Kulin settlement. The only place with a population exceeding 5000 is Jessor town, which has 8152.

The principal staple in Jessor is rice; among other crops are barley, Indian corn, pease, mustard, jute, tobacco, potatoes, sugarcane, indigo, pan, dates, &c. The total cultivated area is about 1,381,800 acres, more than a million of which arc said to be under rice. The estimated area covered by date-palms for the manufacture of sugar is 17,500 acres. The area under indigo is 31,333 acres. The total produce in 1872-73 was 203 tons, valued at £114,400. There are about fifty-five European factories, besides fifty worked in the interest of native proprietors under European or native management. Blights occur occasionally. The district is subject to heavy floods, which have sometimes been immediately-followed by disastrous cyclones. Several inundations have taken place, causing famine.

The trade of Jessor is carried on chiefly by means of permanent markets, but there is also a considerable traffic at the numerous fairs and religious gatherings held throughout the district. The chief exports are sugar, indigo, rice, pulse, timber, honey, shells, &c.; the chief imports are salt, English goods, and cloth. The principal manufactures are date-sugar and indigo. The police-force consisted in 1871 of 590 officers and men, maintained at a cost of £13,548. In 1871 the number of Government and aided schools was 390, with 12,349 pupils. The climate does not differ from that of the other districts of Lower Bengal. April, May, and June are very trying, their average mean temperature being 83 o- 6 Fahr. The average rainfall is about 65 inches. Malarious diseases are very prevalent, intermittent fever being common throughout the year. Cholera breaks out every hot season.

British administration was completely established in the district in 1781, when the governor-general ordered the opening of a court at Murali near Jessor. Before that, however, the fiscal administration of the district had been in the hands of the English, having been transferred to the East India Company with that of the rest of Bengal in 1765. The changes in jurisdiction in Jessor have been very numerous. After many transfers and rectifications, the district was in 1863 finally constituted as it at present stands. The rajas of Jessor or Chânchrâ trace their origin to Bhâbeswar Râi, a soldier in the army of Khan-i-Azam, an imperial general, who deprived Râjâ Pratâpâditya, the popular hero of the Sundarbans, of several fiscal divisions, and conferred them on Bhâbeswar. But Manohar Râi (1649-1705) is regarded as the principal founder of the family. The estate when he inherited it was of moderate size, but he acquired one parganâ after another, until, at his death, the property was by far the largest in the neighbourhood.
