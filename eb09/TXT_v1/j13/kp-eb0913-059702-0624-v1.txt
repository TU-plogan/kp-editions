JÁTIVA, or San Felipe de Jâtiva, according to the old orthography Xâtiva, a city of Spain in the province of Valencia, is picturesquely situated on the margin of a beautiful and fertile huerta or plain, at the foot of an overhanging eminence, on the right bank of the Albâida, a tributary of the Jιicar. The principal public building is the collegiate church, begun in 1414; it has a fine dome. There are three parish churches besides, and twelve religious houses, also a hospital. The manufactures of the place are unimportant, and its trade purely local. The population in 1877 was 14,534.

Jativa, the Saetabis of Pliny and Martial, was celebrated in the time of the Romans for its linen manufactures. It was then known also as Valeria Augusta. It is believed to have been of Phoenician origin. During the time of the Moors, who knew how to utilize its fine situation and fertile neighbourhood, it enjoyed great prosperity. It was taken in 1224 by Jaime I. of Valencia; and in 1347 it received the rank of a city. In the succession war it sustained a long siege with great firmness and bravery, and, when taken at last, received from its captors the name of San Felipe. Jâtiva was the birthplace of the painter Ribera (1588), and to it also the historical family of the Borgias or Borjas originally’ belonged.
