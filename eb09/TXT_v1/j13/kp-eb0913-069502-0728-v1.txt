JOAN, the name given to a female pope, now regarded as a fictitious personage, who under the title of John VII. or VIII. was said, according to the most general accounts, to have occupied the papal chair between the pontificate of Leo IV. and Benedict III., although various other dates are given. Tradition represents her as of English descent, but born in Ingelheim or Mainz. By some her original name is given as Gilberta, by others as Agnes. She was credited with having fallen in love with a young Benedictine monk, and with having on that account assumed the male monastic habit and lived for some time in the monastery of Fulda. Her lover, it is affirmed, died while they were pursuing their studies together at Athens, and after his death she went to Rome, where, according to the most approved version of the story, she became a very successful professor. So high indeed became her reputation for piety and learning that the cardinals with one consent elected the supposed young monk the successor of Pope Leo IV. In this position she comported herself so as entirely to justify their choice until the catastrophe of giving birth to a male child during a procession to the Lateran palace suddenly and irrevocably blasted her reputation. She is said either to have died in childbirth or to have been stoned to death.

The story of the pontificate of Joan was received as fact from the 13th to the 15th century, but it has been discredited by later researches. The circumstantial evidence around which it clung, and which may have aided in suggesting it, was the observance of a circuit by the papal processions so as to avoid passing through a certain street (a statue at one time standing in that street, said to represent a woman and child, with a monumental stone near it having a peculiar inscription), and the use of a pierced seat at the enthronement of the popes. Of these facts other and more credible explanations have, however, been given, although there is no sufficient evidence to demonstrate beyond dispute the manner in which the story originated. According to Dr Dollinger, who gives an elaborate analysis of the story in Die Papst-Fabeln des Mittelalters, Munich, 1863, the tradition finds no support in the original text either of Marianus Scotus, Sigebert of Gemblours, or Otto of Freysingen. She is first mentioned by Stephen de Bourbon, who died in 1261, and who took his information probably from the chronicle of the Dominican Jean de Mailly, no copy of which is now known to be in existence. The story is not found in any of the original manuscripts of Martinus Γolus, and according to Dollinger was interpolated in that chronicle some time between 1278 and 1312. He attributes the propagation of the myth chiefly to its insertion in Martinus Γolus, from which it was copied into the Flores Temporum, a chronicle founded on Martinus, and its real originators he supposes to have been the Dominicans and Minorites, who had a grudge against the papacy on account of the persecutions they were experiencing at the hands of Benedict VIII. So rapidly did the tradition spread that in 1400 a bust of the papess was placed in the cathedral of Siena along with the other popes, having the inscription “John VIII., a woman from England.” The statue occupied this position till the beginning of the 17th century.

See the work of Dollinger above mentioned, which has been translated into English both in England and in America, and the authorities therein referred to.
