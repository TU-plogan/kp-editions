JEPHTHAH (∏∏5), Ιe<∕>0dε), one of the “judges” of Israel, was an illegitimate son of “Gilead,” and, being expelled from his father’s house by his lawful brethren, took refuge in the Syrian land of Tob, where he gathered around him a powerful band of homeless men like himself. The Ammonites pressing hard on his countrymen, the “elders of Gilead” called for his help, which he consented to give on condition that in the event of victory the supremacy should be conferred upon him. The success of his arms was complete, and he became in consequence “judge” of Israel until his death six years afterwards. His name is best known in history and literature in connexion with his “vow,” which led to the sacrifice of his daughter as a burnt offering on his return from the war. Much reluctance has been, and continues to be, shown by many writers in accepting the plain sense of the Scripture narrative on this point, —reluctance which proceeds to a large extent on unwarranted assumptions as to the stage of ethical development which had been reached in Israel in the period of the judges, or at the time when the narrative took shape. Several modern writers, on the other hand, are disposed to find a mythical element in the history of Jephthah. In this connexion weight has been laid on his name, “the opener,” on the fact that Gilead is not a personal name, and particularly on the circumstance that what is related about his daughter appears to be the popular explanation of a ceremony closely allied to well-known rites connected with solar mythology. The story of Jephthah is told in Judg. X. 15-xii. 7; a great part of this section of that book, however, is occupied with an allocution (xi. 14-27) to the children of Ammon which almost certainly belongs to a later hand.
