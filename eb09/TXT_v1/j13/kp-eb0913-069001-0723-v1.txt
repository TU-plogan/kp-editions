JHANSI, a British district in the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces, India, between 25° 3' 45" and 25° 48' 45" N. lat., and between 78° 2Γ 15" and 79° 27' 30" E. long. It forms the central district in the division^[1. The division of Jhansi is under a commissioner in the North-Western Provinces, and comprises' the three districts of Jhânsi, Jalâun, and Lâlitpur, which contain a large portion of the tract known as Bundelkhand. The area in 1872 was 5067 square miles, the population 934,943.] of the same name, and is bounded on the N. by the Gwalior and Samthar states, on the E. by the river Dhasân, on the S. by the district of Lâlitpur and the Orchha state, and on the W. by the Datiyâ, Gwalior, and Khaniya Dânâ states. Jhânsi forms a portion of the hill country of Bundelkhand, sloping down from the outliers of the Vindhyân range on the south to the tributaries of the Jumna on the north. The extreme south is composed of parallel rows of long and narrow-ridged hills. Through the intervening valleys the rivers of the district flow down impetuously over ledges of granite or quartz. North of the hilly region, the rocky granite chains gradually lose themselves in clusters of smaller hills. The northern portion consists of the level plain of Bundelkhand, distinguished for its deep black soil, known as mdr, and admirably adapted for the cultivation of cotton. The district is intersected or bounded by three principal rivers—the Pahüj, Betwa, and Dhasân. There are many minor streams, most of which are feeders of the Dhasân. The district is much cut up, and portions of it are insulated by the surrounding native states.

The census of 1872, taken over an area of 1567 square miles, returned a population of 317,826, of whom (exclusive of non-Asiatics) 167,519 were males and 150,216 females. As regards religion, 305,151 were Hindus, while only 12,417 were Mahometans. Five towns have a population exceeding 5000:—Mhow, 15,065; Ranipur, 6326; Giirsarai, 5897; Barwa Sagar, 5556; and Bhânder, 5141. Jhansi, in the nature of its soil, the character of its people, the poor means of irrigation, and the want of good communication, is worse off than any other district in the North-Western Provinces, except Lâlitpur. Out of a total area of 1,002,734 acres, only 428,348 acres were under cultivation. The principal crops are joAr, bdjra, cotton, tili or oilseed, kodon (a kind of pulse), wheat, gram, and barley. The most important product is the al dye, procured from the root of the Morinda citrifolia, which is only dug up every third year. The destructive kilns grass has proved as great a pest here as elsewhere in Bundelkhand. Jhansi is specially exposed to blights, droughts, floods, hailstorms, epidemics, and their natural consequence— famine. It is considered that famine may be feared on an average every five years. The district imports grain, and in return exports the al dye and cotton. The 110 schools in 1870 taught 2235 pupils at a cost of £1247. The climate is hot and very dry, but not unhealthy. The mean annual temperature for 1871 was 81° '7 Fahr. The average rainfall for the ten years ending 1870 was 31 inches. The population are habitually underfed, and consequently succumb readily to slight diseases.

Nothing is known with certainty as to the history of this district before the period of Chandel rule, about the 11th century of our era. To this epoch must be referred the artificial reservoirs and architectural remains of the hilly region. The Chandels were succeeded by their servants the Khangars, who built the fort of Karâr, lying just outside the British lines. About the 14 th century the Bundelas poured down upon the plains, and gradually spread themselves over the whole region which now bears their name. The Mahometan subahMrs were constantly making irruptions into the Bundela country; and in 1732 Chhatarsâl, the Bundela chieftain, called in the aid of the Marhattâs. They came to his assistance with their accustomed promptitude, and were rewarded, on the rajas death in 1734, by one-third of his dominions. Their general founded the city of Jhansi, and peopled it with inhabitants from Orchha state. In 1806 the British protection was promised to the Marhatta viceroy, and in 1814 the peshwa ceded to the East India Company his rights over Bundelkhand. In 1853 Gan-gadhar Râo died childless, and his territories lapsed to the British. The Jhansi state and the Jalaun and Chanderi districts were then, formed into a superintendency. The widow of the late raja con» sidered herself aggrieved because she was not allowed to adopt an heir, and because the slaughter of cattle was permitted in the Jhansi territory. Reports were spread which excited the religious prejudices of ' the Hindus. The events of 1857 accordingly found Jhansi ripe for mutiny. In June a few men of the 12th native infantry seized the fort containing the treasure and magazine, and massacred the European officers of the garrison. . Everywhere the usual anarchic quarrels rose anion" the rebels, and the country was plundered mercilessly. The rani put herself at the head of the rebels, and died bravely in battle. It was not till November 1858, after a series of sharp contests with various guerilla leaders, that the work of reorganization was fairly set on foot. Since that time Jhansi has remained a British district, and famines and floods alone have disturbed the prosperous course of civil administration.

Jhansi, a city and fort in Gwalior state, NorthWestern Provinces, India, in 25° 27' 30" N. lat. and 78° 37' E. long. A stone fort crowns a neighbouring rock, and commands the town, as well as the British outpost, Jhânsi Naoâbâd, which adjoins the city. It lapsed to the British in 1853, and during the mutiny was the scene of insurrection and massacre. In 1861 the town, fcrt, and surrounding territory beyond the Pahüj were handed over to Gwalior state. The administrative headquarters of Jhânsi district is Jhânsi Naoâbâd, which had a population in 1872 of 536 persons. The estimated population of Jhânsi proper is 30,000.
