JORDAN (∏T “swift-flowing”), the principal river of Palestine. The historical source of this famous stream is the cave at Bâniâs (Caesarea Philippi), while the stream from Dan (Tell el Kâdy) is called Lesser Jordan by Josephus, although the larger of the two springs at the Tell is probably the largest fountain in Syria. A third affluent, which has a better geographical claim to be considered the true Jordan, is the Nahr Hasbâny, rising near Hasbeiya on Hermon. The stream from Bâniâs joins that from Tell el Kâdy after a course of 5 miles, descending by cascades through thickets and cane brakes, and a little lower down the Nahr Hasbâny, after a course of 15 miles, joins the united stream from the other sources. The Bâniâs source is about 1000 feet above the Mediterranean, and, after passing through the papyrus swamps, the river reaches the Hûleh Lake (Merom or Semechonitis), falling 1000 feet in 12 miles. The Hûleh is 4 miles long, and thence to the Sea of Galilee is 10⅜ miles, with a fall of 682 feet. The second lake (see Galilee) is 12⅜ miles [9:13:747] long. The fall of the river after leaving it is at first 40 feet per mile, but on entering the plain of Beisân it becomes only 10 or 12 feet per mile, and further south only 4 or 5 feet. The total length from Bâniâs to the Dead Sea is 104 miles direct, and, as the level of the Dead Sea is 1292 ’ 5 below the Mediterranean, the total fall is nearly 2300 feet. Thus the Jordan is only half as long as the Thames, and the Sea of Galilee about equal in length to Windermere. The Gh6r or valley of Jordan south of the Sea of Galilee varies in width from 4 to 14 miles east and west; the course of the river is extremely tortuous, and it is hidden by a dense jungle of cane, willow, and tamarisk, growing on the water’s edge in the sunken channel called Z0r, which is about a mile wide, with steep banks of white marl 50 to 100 feet high. For the last few miles the stream is free from jungle, flowing through a muddy flat. The average width is from 30 to 50 yards, but in February the river “overflows its banks” (Josh. iii. 15) and fills the Zér. The Arabs enumerate some forty fords, mostly passable in summer only. Of these the most important is t Abarah near Beisân,—probably the Bethabara of Origen, the Onomastica, and the common text of John i. 28, where Bethany is the true reading. There is a ferry immediately south of the Sea of Galilee, and another on the road fromShechem to Gilead; the latter is called Ed Dâmieh, and has been conjectured to preserve the name of Adam (Josh. iii. 16) or Admah (Gen. x. 19). The ford of Hajlah, east of Jericho, is probably that of Josh, iii., and is the traditional site of Bethabara. The four main affluents of Jordan are the Hieromax (Yarmuk) and the Jabbok on the east, and on the west the Jâlùd passing Beisân, and the Fâri'a rising not far from Shechem. The supply of these and other perennial streams scarcely, however, balances the loss from evaporation of the river. Salt springs flow to Jordan along the greater part of its course south of Beisân. The valley, formed by a depression in the early Tertiary period, was once filled by a chain of lakes, and raised beaches have been found in various parts of the Ghôr.
