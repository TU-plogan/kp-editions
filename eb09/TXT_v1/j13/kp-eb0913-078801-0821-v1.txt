JUSSIEU, De, the name of a distinguished French family, which came into prominent notice towards the close of the 16th century, and for a century and a half was illustrious for the botanists it produced. The following are its more eminent members.

I. Antoine de Jussieu (1686-1758), born at Lyons in 1686, was the earliest in point of time of the line of distinguished botanists of his name. He was the son of Christophe de Jussieu (or Dejussieu), an apothecary of some repute, who published a Nouveau, traité de la thériaque, Trévoux, 1708. Antoine studied at the university of Montpellier, and travelled with his brother Bernard through Spain, Portugal, and southern France. He came to Paris in 1708, Tournefort, whom he succeeded, dying in that year. His own original publications are not of marked importance, but he edited an edition of Tournefort’s Institutiones rei herbariae, Paris, 1719, 3 vols. He performed a similar office for a posthumous work of Barrelier, Plantae per Galliam, Hispaniam, et Italiam observatae, &c., Paris, 1714. He practised medicine, chiefly devoting himself to the very poor. He died at Paris, 2 2d April 1758.

II. Bernard de Jussieu (1699-1777), a younger brother of the above, was also born at Lyons, in 1699. He was educated for the medical profession, took his doctor’s degree at Montpellier, and commenced practice in 1720, but his sensitive temperament hindered his prosecution of it, and on his brother’s invitation he gladly joined him in Paris in 1722. He succeeded Vaillant as subdemonstrator of plants in the Jardin du Roi, and his principal duties consisted in superintending the herbor-izations of the students. His knowledge of plants and even of non-botanical subjects was so great that he readily detected and named the component parts of made-up plants which were sometimes submitted to him. It is reported that at one of these excursions, whilst Linnaeus was his guest, the students having brought some such counterfeit to be named by the young Swede, his reply was “Aut Deus, aut D. de Jussieu.” In 1725 he brought out a new edition of Tournefort’s Histoire des plantes qui naissent aux environs de Paris, in 2 vols., which was afterwards translated into English by John Martyn,—the original work being incomplete. In the same year he was admitted into the Académie des Sciences, and communicated several papers to that body. Long before Tremblay published his Histoire des polypes deau douce, he maintained the doctrine that these organisms were animals, and not the flowers of marine plants, then the current notion; and to confirm his views he made three journeys to the coast of Normandy. Singularly modest and retiring, he published very little, but in 1759 he arranged the plants in the royal garden of the Trianon at Versailles, according to his own scheme of classification. This arrangement is printed in his nephew’s Genera, pp. lxiii.-lxx., and formed the basis of that work. He cared little for the credit of enunciating new discoveries, so long as the facts themselves were made public. On the death of his brother Antoine, he could not be induced to succeed him in his office, but prevailed upon Lemonnier to assume the higher position. He died at Paris, 6th November 1777.

III. Joseph de Jussieu (1704-1779), brother of Antoine and Bernard, was born at Lyons 3d September 1704. Educated like the rest of the family for the medical profession, he accompanied La Condamine to Peru, in the expedition for measuring an arc of meridian, and remained in South America for thirty-six years,, returning to France in 1771. His health having previously failed, his works were never printed, and remain in manuscript. During his long absence, he was a member of the Académie des Sciences, although for thirty-five years he never came near the place where that body held its deliberations. Amongst the seeds he sent to Bernard were those of Heliotropium ρeruviaηum, Linn., then first introduced into Europe. He died at Paris, 11th April 1779.

IV. Antoine Laurent de Jussieu (1748-1836), nephew of the three preceding, was born at Lyons on 12th April 1748. Called to Paris by his uncle Bernard, and carefully trained by him for the pursuits of medicine and botany, he largely profited by the opportunities afforded him. Gifted with a tenacious memory, and the power of quickly grasping the salient points of subjects under observation, he steadily worked at the improvement of that system of plant-arrangement which had been sketched out by his uncle. In 1789 was issued his Genera plantarum secundum ordines naturales disposita, juxta methodum in horto regio Parisiensi exaratam, anno MDCCLXXiv, Paris, 8vo. The influence of this volume is briefly noticed in the article Botany, vol. iv. p. 80; it formed the foundation on which modern classification was afterwards built; more than this, it is certain that Cuvier derived much help in his zoological classification from its perusal. Hardly had the last sheet passed through the press, when the French Revolution broke out, and the author was installed in charge of the hospitals of Paris. The Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle was organized on its present footing mainly by him in 1793, and he selected for its library everything relating to natural history from the vast materials obtained from the convents then broken up. He continued as professor of botany there from 1770 to 1826, when his son Adrien succeeded him. Besides the Genera, he produced nearly sixty memoirs on botanical topics. He died at Paris, 17 th September 1836.

V. Adrien (Laurent Henri) de Jussieu (1797— 1853), son of Antoine Laurent, was born at Paris 23d December 1797. Although his youth was delicate, he displayed the qualities of his family in his thesis for the degree of M.D., De Euphorbiacearum generibus medicisque earundem viribus tentamen, Paris, 1824. He was also the author of valuable contributions to botanical literature oh the Putaceae, Meliaceae, and Mdlpighiaceae, respectively, of “Taxonomie” in the Dictionnaire universelle d , histoire naturelle, and of an introductory work styled simply Botam ique, which reached nine editions, and has been translated into the principal languages of Europe. He also edited his father’s Introductio in historiam plantarum, issued at Paris, without imprint or date, it being a fragment of the intended second edition of the Genera, which Antoine Laurent did not live to complete. He died at Paris, 29 th June 1853, leaving two daughters, but no son, so that with him closed the brilliant botanical dynasty.

VI. Laurent (Pierre) de Jussieu (1792—1866). This miscellaneous writer, nephew of Antoine Laurent, was born at Villeurbanne, 7th February 1792. Simon de Nantua, au le marchand forain, Paris, 1818, reached fifteen editions, and has been translated into seven languages. He also wrote Simples notions de physique et d , histoire naturelle, Paris, 1857, and a few geological papers. He died in 1866.
