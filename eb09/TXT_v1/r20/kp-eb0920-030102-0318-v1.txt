RAYMOND of Sabunde (Sebonde, Sebeyde, Ac.) appears to have been born at Barcelona towards the end of the 14th century. He combined the training of a physician and a theologian, and was professor of theology at Toulouse, seemingly from the year 1430 oivwards. He published there in 1436 his chief work, Theologia Naturalis, sive liber creaturarum. This book was reprinted pretty frequently during the next two centuries, and has recently been republished at Sulzbacli (1852), but without the introduction, which, for some not very intelligible reason, was placed upon the Itidex by the council of Trent. It was translated into French by. Montaigne at the command of his father (see Montaigne, Essais , ii. 12). The six Dialogi de natura hominis are an extract from the larger work made by Raymond himself. Raymond is a scholastic of the period of decline. The chief thought of the Theologia Naturalis is the parallelism between the book of nature and the book of revelation. The second of these two books is more sacred on account of its supernatural character, but a foundation must be laid by the study of the first. Nature culminates in man, who alone of the creatures possesses all the four properties which mark off the different grades of existence (esse, vivere, sentire, intelligere). But man himself points forward to a self-existent unity in which individual differences disappear. Everything that we find in the creatures is present in God without limitation or negation, so that God’s being is the universal being of all things. Hence it is true that God created the world out of nothing. Raymond endeavours to deduce the principal dogmas of the church by the natural light in a similar fashion. Man’s own advantage and the glory of God are [9:20:302]the ultimate rules of conduct, and the coincidence of the two is maintained on the ground of the joys of knowledge. Knowledge has its natural consummation in the knowledge of God; man’s knowledge of God is at the same time the love and gratitude which he, as representative of the creatures and mediator between them and God, continually offers to the divine majesty. The fact that self-love and the love of God are at present often in conflict is traced by Raymond to the fall of the first human pair; and this gives him occasion to deduce the doctrine of the incarnation, almost in the words of Anselm’s Cur Deus homo.
