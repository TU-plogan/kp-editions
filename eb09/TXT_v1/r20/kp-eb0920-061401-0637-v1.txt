ROCHESTER a city of the United States, capital of Monroe county, New York, lies 229 miles to the west of Albany (43° 9' 22" - 44 N. lat. and 77° 36' 50" , 97 W. long.), in a rich agricultural region, upon a plateau on both banks of the Genesee river, 7 miles from its mouth at Lake Ontario and 263 feet above the lake level. There are three falls in the river of 96, 26, and 83 feet respectively within the city limits, the banks below the first fall varying in height from 100 to 210 feet. To this abundant water-power of the Genesee, supplemented by the transportation facilities afforded by the Erie Canal and the various railway connexions, Rochester mainly owes its progress and prosperity. The streets of the city are generally wide, and well paved and lighted (partly by electricity), and trees and flowering plants are abundant. Rochester is an important railway centre. The New York Central Railroad, with elevated tracks through the city, has two lines east to Syracuse, two west to Buffalo and Niagara Falls respectively, and one north to Charlotte, where connexion is made with the Rome, Watertown, and Ogdensburg line; a branch of the New York, Lake Erie, and Western Railway connects with the main line at Corning and with the Buffalo branch at Avon; the Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway runs south to Salamanca, and the Genesee Valley Railway to Olean, crossing the West Shore Railway a short distance south of the city line; and there are also railway lines to Irondequoit Bay and Windsor beach, and about 30 miles of street railway, radiating from the centre in all directions. The manufactures of Rochester are numerous and varied. Though no longer at the head of the flour industry, it still possesses twenty mills, capable of producing 2900 barrels daily. The principal manufacture is that of ready-made clothing, the sales reaching $9,000,000 annually. In its boot and shoe trade the city ranks fourth in the country (5000 hands; annual sales, $6,500,000). There are also sixteen breweries and ten malt-houses; some eighty or ninety cigar-makers and tobacconists have a total output of about 2,000,000 lb of tobacco, 18,000,000 cigars, and 140,000,000 cigarettes; while furniture-making employs 1000 hands. The lumber business is extensive; and of late years the city has been one of the principal centres for the distribution of the anthracite and bituminous coal of Pennsylvania. Its numerous nurseries are a peculiar feature of the place; and there is a great variety of other industries. The main supply of water is brought in iron conduits (147 miles of pipe) from Hemlock Lake, 29 miles to the south; an additional supply for subsidiary purposes is drawn from the Genesee river (ll∣ miles of pipe). The total cost of the works has been $3,744,749. The princi pal cemetery, Mount Hope, with an area of 200 acres, is exceedingly picturesque and well cared for. Rochester has two State institutions, the Western House of Refuge and the Western New York Institution for Deaf Mutes. The former, opened in 1849, is a substantial structure of brick, with accommodation for 600 inmates, built at a cost of $373,000; it receives juvenile delinquents committed by magistrates; they are instructed in trades and labour upon the farm belonging to the refuge. The institution for deaf mutes (1875) instructs about 160 pupils annually. Among the eleemosynary institutions of the city are the Rochester city hospital, St Mary’s hospital, the Rochester, St Patrick’s, St Mary’s, St Joseph’s, and the Jewish orphan asylums, the home for the friendless, the industrial school, the church home, the home of industry, and the home for truant children. There are 75 churches, including the Roman Catholic cathedral, 6 Baptist, 10 Methodist Episcopal, 10 Protestant Episcopal, 11 Presbyterian, 5 Lutheran, and 11 Roman Catholic churches, and 5 Jewish synagogues. The public school system of Rochester includes a free academy (cost $125,000) and thirty grammar-schools (with classes in the orphan asylums), in which 200 teachers are engaged and 10,000 pupils taught. There are also thirty private institutions, academies, seminaries, and parochial schools. The university of Rochester was established in 1850, under Baptist auspices; its faculty consists of a president and ten professors, and the annual attendance of students is about 160. It has two buildings,—Anderson Hall and Sible Hall. The Rochester theological seminary (Baptist), founded in 1850 and housed in two commodious buildings—Trevor and Rockefeller Halls—has eight professors and about seventy students, besides a German department. Other public libraries in addition to those of the university and the theological seminary are the central and Reynolds. There are four English and two German daily newspapers,, and twelve weekly and nine monthly publications. Among, edifices not already mentioned are the city-hall, the United States Government building, the court-house, the Warner astronomical observatory, the Rochester and East Side savings banks, the Powers buildings, with their famous art gallery, and the Warner and Kimball factories. The population (89,366 in 1880) was estimated at 115,000 in 1885; the area of the city, which is divided into sixteen wards, is 4 square miles. The assessed valuation of real and personal property in 1885 was $40,952,070, and the debt was $5,249,000.

Rochester derives its name from Nathaniel Rochester, who projected a settlement here in 1810; the first house was built in 1812; and the incorporation of the city dates from 1834.
