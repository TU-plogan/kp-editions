RÁKÓCZY, the name of an old and wealthy family of upper Hungary. Sigismund was on 11th February 1607 elected prince of Transylvania, but in the following year abdicated in favour of Gabriel Bathori, to whom succeeded

Bethlen Gfibor. Bethlen died in 1629, and George I. (1591-1648), son of Sigismund, born in 1591, was, after the demission of Gdbor’s widow, Catherine of Brandenburg, 26th November 1631, elected prince of Transylvania by the estates. In 1645 he joined the Swedes in an attempt to deliver Hungary from the yoke of Austria and secure religious liberty to the Protestants, but when the emperor Ferdinand showed a disposition to enter into a treaty with him he became oblivious of the cause of which he had been the professed champion. By the treaty of Linz he was formally recognized as prince of Transylvania. He died on 24th October 1648. George II. (1615-1660), son of the preceding, was chosen by the estates to succeed him as prince of Transylvania. Having been disappointed in his hopes of the crown of Poland on the death of Casimir V., he entered into an alliance with John Casimir and invaded the country, but was completely defeated on 16th July 1657. His procedure against Poland provoked the hostility of the Turks, with whom he was engaged in continual war until his death at Grosswardein on 26th June 1660, from wounds received at the battle of Klausenburg. Francis I. (1642-1676), son of the preceding, did not succeed his father as prince of Transylvania. Having become connected with a plot for the overthrow of the Austrian Government, his life was only saved through the intervention of his mother, who was a Catholic, and he had to pay a fine of 400,000 florins. He edited a volume of prayers, which had an extensive circulation in Hungary. He died on 8th July 1676. Francis Leopold (1676-1735), son of the preceding, was at the age of twelve along with his mother made prisoner by the Austrians, and by them was educated in a Jesuit college in Bohemia. After his marriage with a princess of Hesse he returned to Hungary, where the greater portion of his estates was restored to him. On account of his connexion with a conspiracy of the malcontent party he was in 1701 arrested and brought to Vienna, but making his escape he went to Poland, where he spent several years in exile. In 1703 he headed a new insurrection, which had achieved considerable success before the death of the emperor Leopold in the end of 1705. Owing to the milder attitude of Joseph I., matters for a time assumed a more peaceful appearance. In 1707 Rfikbczy was elected prince of Transylvania, and on 31st May of this year the independence of Hungary was proclaimed. From this time, however, the fortunes of the Hungarian cause began to decline, and Rfikdczy finally in despair, having refused an amnesty and offers of pardon, retired to the frontiers of Poland, after which, on 1st May 1711, peace was concluded at Szatmar. Rakoczy refused to own it, and retired to France and subsequently to Turkey, where he died at Rodosto on 8th April 1735. (See Hungary, vol. xii. pp. 369-370.)
