RADCLIFFE a town of Lancashire, is situated on the river Irwell, crossed by a bridge of two arches, and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 7 miles north-west of Manchester and 2 south-west of Bury. The church of St Bartholomew dates from the time of Henry IV.; some of the Norman portions of the building still remain. The tower was rebuilt in 1665, the north transept added in 1846, and the whole building restored in 1870-73. It possesses some good windows and several ancient monu [9:20:211]ments. Radcliffe Tower, dating from the 13th century, and formerly an extensive manorial residence, is now a complete ruin. Cotton-weaving, calico-printing, and bleaching are the principal industries, and there are extensive collieries in the neighbourhood. The town is governed by a local board of health established in 1866. The area of the urban sanitary district is 2453 acres, with a population in 1871 of 11,446, and in 1881 of 16,267.

Radcliffe is so called from a cliff of red rock on the south side of the Irwell opposite the town. The manor was held by Edward the Confessor, and was conferred on Roger de Poictou, but was forfeited by him soon after the Domesday survey. In the reign of Stephen it was granted to Ranulph de Gernons, earl of Chester.
