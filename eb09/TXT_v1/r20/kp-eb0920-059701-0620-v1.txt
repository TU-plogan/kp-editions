ROBERTS David (1796-1864), landscape painter, was born at Stockbridge, Edinburgh, on 24th October 1796. At an early age he manifested a great love for art; but his father, a shoemaker, wished him to follow the same trade. He was, however, apprenticed for seven years to a painter and house-decorator; and during this time he employed his evenings in the earnest study of art. For the next few years his time was divided between work as a house-painter and as a scene-painter, and he even appeared occasionally on the boards as an actor in pantomimes. In 1820 he formed the acquaintance of Clarkson Stanfield, then painting at the Pantheon, Edinburgh, by whose advice and example he greatly profited and at whose suggestion he began his career as an exhibitor, sending three pictures in 1822 to the “Exhibition of Works by Living Artists,” held in Edinburgh. In the same year he removed to London, where he worked for the Coburg Theatre, and was afterwards employed, along with Stanfield, at Drury Lane. In 1824 he exhibited at the British Institution a view of Dryburgh Abbey, and sent two works to the first exhibition of the Society of British Artists, which he had joined, and of which he was elected president in 1831. In the same autumn he visited Normandy, and the works which were the results of this excursion began to lay the foundation of the artist’s reputation,—one of them, a view of Rouen Cathedral, being sold for eighty guineas. By his scenes for an opera entitled The Seraglio, executed two years later, he won much contemporary praise, and these, along with the scenery for a pantomime dealing with the naval victory of Navarino, and two panoramas executed jointly by him and Stanfield, were among his last work for the theatres. In 1829 he exhibited his imposing subject the Departure of the Israelites from Egypt, a commission from Lord North wick, in which the style of the painter first becomes clearly apparent; and three years afterwards he travelled in Spain, and passed over to Tangiers, returning in the end of 1833 with a supply of effective sketches, which were speedily elaborated into attractive and popular paintings. His Interior of Seville Cathedral was exhibited in the British Institution in 1834, and sold for £300; and he executed a fine series of Spanish illustrations for the Landscape Annual of 1836, a publication to which he contributed for four years; while in 1837 a selection of his Picturesque Sketches in Spain was reproduced by lithography, many of the subjects being carefully retouched on. the stone by the artist’s own hand.

In 1838 Roberts made a long tour in the East, sailing up the Nile, visiting Luxor and Karnak, and afterwards making his way to the Holy Land. He thus accumulated a vast collection of sketches of a class of scenery which had hitherto been hardly touched by British artists, and which appealed to the public with all the charm of novelty. The next ten years of his life were mainly spent in elaborating these materials. Many Eastern subjects were painted, and an extensive series of drawings was lithographed by Louis Haghe in the superb work, Sketches in the Holy Land and Syria, 1842-49. In 1851, and again in 1853, Roberts visited Italy, painting the Ducal Palace, Venice, bought by Lord Londesborough, the interior of the Basilica of St Peter’s, Rome, Christmas Day, 1853, and Rome from the Convent of St Onofrio, presented to the Royal Scottish Academy. His last volume of illustrations, Italy, Classical, Historical, and Picturesque, was published in 1859. He also executed, by command of the queen, a picture of the opening of the Great Exhibition of 1851,— a laborious and rather uncongenial task. In 1839 he was elected an associate, and in 1841 a full member of the Royal Academy; and in 1858 he was presented with the freedom of the city of Edinburgh. The last years of his life were occupied with a series of views of London from the Thames. He had executed six of these and was at work upon a picture of St Paul’s Cathedral, when on 25th November 1864 he was seized with an attack of apoplexy and expired the same evening.

The quality of Roberts’s work is exceedingly equal and uniform during his whole career. The architecture, which is so prominent a feature in his paintings, is introduced with great picturesqueness and an easy command of its salient points, but with little care for the minutiae of detail. His art was conventional, essentially scenic and spectacular in character, showing effective composition and an unerring instinct for broad general effect, but destitute of that close adherence to nature, that delicacy and truth of tone and colour, which are becoming increasingly characteristic of the productions of the English school. Something of the scene-painter appears in all his works, and his certainty and speed of execution were undoubtedly founded upon his early practice for the stage.

A Life of Roberts, compiled from his journals and other sources by James Ballantine, with etchings and pen-and-ink sketches by the artist, appeared in Edinburgh in 1S66.
