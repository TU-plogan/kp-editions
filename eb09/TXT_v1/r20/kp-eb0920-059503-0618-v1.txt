ROBERT Louis Léopold (1794-1835), French painter, was born at Chaux de Fonds (Neufchâtel) in Switzerland on 13th May 1794, but left his native place with the en[9:20:596]graver Girardet at the age of sixteen for Paris. He was on the eve of obtaining the great prize for engraving when the events of 1815 blasted his hopes, for Neufchâtel was restored to Prussia and Robert was struck off the list of competitors as a foreigner. Having fortunately whilst continuing his studies under Girardet never ceased to frequent the studio of David, he now determined to become a painter, and only returned to his native country when his master himself was exiled. At Neufchâtel he had the good fortune to attract the notice of Roullet de Mezerac, who enabled him by a timely loan to proceed to Rome. At Rome Robert soon struck the vein of subject destined to render his talent celebrated. In depicting the customs and life of the people, of southern Italy especially, he showed peculiar feeling for the historical characteristics of their race. All his work of this class was distinguished by an individual style: the actors bore themselves with an air of distinction and something of gravity which witnessed to their ancient lineage, and the rhythmical play of line which characterized all these compositions had a peculiar affinity to the nature of the types which figured in them. The charm of choice in these types, the beauty of this play of line, and the plastic restraint and measure which also marked Robert’s treatment of his favourite subjects were the points to which he owed the wide recognition of his talent, for his command of his own powers was anything but ready and his difficulty in bringing out what he desired to produce shackled him, and especially so because painting requires a sure and ready hand if its means are to be used with brilliant effect. After executing many detached studies of Italian life Robert conceived the idea of painting four great works which should represent at one and the same time the four seasons in Italy and the four leading races of its people. In the Return from the Fête of the Madonna delΓ Arco (Louvre) he depicted the Neapolitans and the spring. This picture, exhibited at the Salon of 1827, achieved undoubted success and was bought for the Luxembourg by Charles X.; but the work which appeared in 1831—the Summer Reapers arriving in the Pontine Marshes (Louvre), which became the property of Louis Philippe — established the artist’s reputation, and Robert found himself with all his hopes of honour fulfilled and reckoned as one of the leading masters of his day. Florence and her autumn vineyards should now have furnished him with his third subject. He attempted to begin it, but, unable to conquer his unhappy passion for Princess Charlotte Napoleon (then mourning the violent death of her husband, Robert’s devoted friend), he threw up his work and went to Venice, where he began and carried through the fourth of the series, the Fishers of the Adriatic. This work was not equal to the Reapers. Worn by the vicissitudes of painful feeling and bitterly discouraged, Robert committed suicide before his easel, 20th March 1835, on the tenth anniversary of the melancholy suicide of a brother to whom he had been much attached.
