RÉMUSAT Abel (1788-1832), a distinguished Chinese scholar, was born at Paris, 5th September 1788. His father, a surgeon, superintended his early education in person and designed him for the medical profession. Jean Pierre Abel Rémusat graduated with distinction as M.D. in 1813, and for a short time held a hospital appointment, but his heart had long been in other studies. A Chinese herbal in the collection of the Abbé Tersan had attracted his attention when he was still a lad; he taught himself to read by great perseverance and with very imperfect helps, and at the end of five years’ study he produced in 1811 an I Essai sur la langue et la littérature Chinoises, and a paper on foreign languages among the Chinese, which procured him the patronage of De Sacy. In 1814a chair of Chinese was founded at the Collège de France, and Rémusat was])laced in it. From this time he gave himself wholly to the languages of the Extreme East, and published a long series of useful works, among which his contributions from Chinese sources to the history of the Tartar nations claim special notice. Rémusat became an editor of the Journal de Savants in 1818, and founder and first secretary of the Paris Asiatic Society in 1822; he held also in the courso of his life various honourable and lucrative Government appointments. He married in 1830, but had no children. He died at Paris, 4 th June 1832, and his éloge was written by De Sacy.
