RATTAZZI Urbano (1808-1873), Italian statesman, was born on 29th June 1808 at Alessandria, and from 1838 practised with great success at the bar. In 1848 he was sent to the chamber of deputies in Turin as representative of his native town. By his debating powers he contributed to the defeat of the Balbo ministry, and for a short time held the portfolio of minister of public instruction; after[9:20:293]wards, under Gioberti, he became minister of the interior, and on the retirement of the last-named in 1849 he became practically the head of the Government. The defeat at Novara compelled the resignation of Rattazzi in March 1849. His election as president of the chamber in 1852 was one of the earliest results of the so-called “connubio” with Cavour, and having become minister of justice in 1853 he in that and the next following years was able to carry a number of measures of reform of considerable importance, including that for the suppression of certain of the monastic orders. During a momentary reaction of public opinion he resigned office in 1858, but again entered the cabinet under La Marmora in 1859 as minister of the interior. In consequence of the cession of Nice and Savoy he again retired in January 1860. He was entrusted with the formation of a new ministry in March 1862, but in consequence of his policy of repression towards Garibaldi was driven from office in the following December. He was again prime minister in 1867, from April to October. His death took place at Frosinone on 5th June 1873. (See Italy, vol. xiii. p. 488 sq.)
