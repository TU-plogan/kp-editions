RANKINE William John Macquorn (1820-1872), a descendant of old Scottish families, the Rankines of Garrick and the Cochranes of Dundonald by the father’s side, and the Grahames of Dougalston by the mother’s, was born at Edinburgh in 1820, and completed his education in its university. He was trained as an engineer under Sir J. Macneill, working chiefly on surveys, harbours, and railroads, and was appointed in 1855 to the chair of civil engineering in Glasgow, vacant by the resignation of Lewis Gordon, whose work he had undertaken during the previous session.

He was a voluminous writer on subjects directly connected with his chair, and, besides contributing almost weekly to the technical journals, such as the Engineer, brought out a series of standard text-books on Civil Engineering , The Steam-Engine and other Prime Movers, Machinery and Millwork, and Applied Mechanics. These have passed through many editions, have done more for the advancement of their subjects than any works of modern date, and are still in the very highest rank of educational works. To these must be added his elaborate treatise on Shipbuilding, Theoretical and Practical. This how r ever, corresponded ־to but one phase of Rankine’s immense energy and many-sided character. He was an enthusiastic and most useful leader of the volunteer movement from its commencement, and a writer, composer, and singer of humorous and patriotic songs, some of which, as “The Three Foot Rule” and “They never shall have Gibraltar,” became well known far beyond the circle of his acquaintance. Rankine w T as the earliest of the three founders of the modern science of Thermodynamics (q.v.) on the bases laid by Sadi Carnot and Joule respectively, and the author of the first formal treatise on the subject. His contributions to the theories of Elasticity and of Waves rank high among modern developments of mathematical physics, although they are mere units among the 150 scientific papers attached to his name in the Royal Society’s Catalogue. The more important of these have been collected and reprinted in a handsome volume (Rankine’s Scientific Papers, London, 1881), which contains a memoir of the author, written by Professor Tait. Rankine died in 1872.
