ROSCELLINUS (also written Rousselin and Ruce-linus), often called the founder of nominalism (see Scholasticism), was born in Armorica or Lower Brittany somewhere about the middle of the llth century. Our information about his life is scanty, and, as he appears to have written nothing, we are dependent for a knowledge of his doctrine upon the statements of his opponents and the cursory statements of later writers. He studied at Soissons and Rheims, was afterwards attached to the cathedral of Chartres, and became canon of Compiègne. It seems most probable that Roscellinus was not strictly the first to promulgate nominalistic doctrines; but in his exposition they received more definite expression, and, being applied to the dogma of the Trinity, attracted universal attention. The chief opponent of Roscellinus was Anselm of Canterbury, w r ho defended at once the realistic doctrine of universals and the orthodox tradition of the church. It appears from the polemic of Anselm that “the heretics in dialectic” whom he combats denied the substantial reality of universals, asserting, for example, that colour has no real existence except as coloured body. There is no reason, however, to suppose that Roscellinus meant thereby to deny the real existence of attributive differences in things, though Anselm endeavours to involve him in that consequence. But we may conclude from the censure of his pupil Abelard that his reaction against realism had led Roscellinus into rashness of expression. In conformity with his general nominalistic position, Roscellinus taught that whatever exists as a real thing or substance exists as one self-identical whole, and is not susceptible of division into parts. This was the part of his teaching which created so much scandal when applied to the doctrine of the Trinity. Roscellinus maintained that it is merely a habit of speech which prevents outspeaking of the three persons as three substances or three Gods. If it were otherwise, and the three persons were really one substance or thing (fitηa res), we should be forced to admit that the Father and the Holy Spirit became incarnate along with the Son. Roscellinus seems to have put forward this doctrine in perfect good faith, and to have claimed for it at first the authority of Lanfranc and Anselm. In 1092, however, a council convoked by the archbishop of Rheims condemned his interpretation, and Roscellinus, who was in danger of being lynched by the orthodox populace, recanted his error. As his enforced penitence did not prove lasting, his opinions were condemned by a second council (1094), and he himself fled to England. Forced by a fresh persecution to return to France at a later date, he taught at Tours and Loc-menach in Brittany (where he had Abelard as a pupil), and resided [9:20:849]latterly as canon at Besançon. Hc is heard of as late as 1121, when he came forward to oppose Abelard’s views on the Trinity.
