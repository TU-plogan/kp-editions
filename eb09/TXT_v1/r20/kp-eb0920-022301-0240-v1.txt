RAILWAY

Railways had their origin in the tramways which were laid more than two hundred years ago in the mineral districts of England for the conveyance of coal to the sea. In those days, before Macadam, roads bearing heavy traffic were with difficulty kept in repair. This led to the plan of laying planks or timbers at the bottom of the ruts as a better contrivance than filling in with stones, and then to laying rails of timber on the level surface. In 1676 tramways consisted of rails of timber laid “from the colliery to the river, exactly straight and parallel, and bulky carts were made with four rollers fitting the rails, whereby the carriage was so easy that one horse would draw down four or five chaldron of coals.” The rails originally were formed of scantlings of good sound oak, and were connected by sills or cross timbers of the same material pinned together with oak trenails. By and by an additional or wearing rail, which could be easily renewed when worn, was placed above the supporting rail, and it was then possible to cover the cross pieces or sleepers with earth to protect them from the horses’ feet. These ways, laid by permission of local proprietors, were called “way-leaves.” It became a common practice to nail down bars of wrought iron on the surfaces of the ascending inclines of the road. These bars or rails were about 2 inches wide and half an inch thick, and were fastened to the wood rails by countersunk spikes. But the iron bars, not being stiff enough, were considerably bent when the trucks were loaded, and the resistance was reduced but slightly below that of a well-constructed double wooden tramway. ^[1.] Nevertheless, while the regular load of coals for one horse on the common road was but 17 cwt., on the tramway the horse could regularly take a load of 42 cwt. Cast-iron was first tried incidentally as a material for rails in 1767 by the Coal-

brookdale Iron Company.

The iron rails were cast in lengths offeet, 4 inches wide, and 1^ inches thick, formed with three holes, through which they were fastened to the oak rails.

The tramway was developed into the railway by the em ployment of cast-iron flange rails (fig. 1) to replace the wooden rails; the continuous flange or ledge on their inner edge kept the wheels on the track. The roads were then called tram-roads, probably as an abbreviation of trammel-roads, the flanges of the rails being in reality trammels to gauge the road and confine the wheels to [9:20:224]the track. The leading objection to this system was that the rail was liable to be covered with dust. Jessop therefore in 1789 laid down at Loughborough cast-iron “edge rails,” raised above the ground so as to allow a flanged cast-iron wheel to run on them (fig. 2). This appears to have been the first system of rails laid on cast-iron chairs and on sleepers.

The rails were pinned or bolted into the chairs. A wrought-iron rail was patented by Birkenshaw in 1820, as the “fish-belly” rail, similar in form and mode of support to Jessop’s rail, but rolled in continuous lengths, embracing a number of spans, with stiffening ledges or flanges on the under side. This form of rail grew into favour. It weighed 33 lb per yard, and was laid in cast-iron chairs, spiked down to square stone blocks at 3-feet bearings (see fig. 3). The edge rail and the flanged wheel constitute the basis of the whole system of a railway. The rails forming a line of way were placed to a gauge or distance apart of 4 feet inches, and two parallel lines of way were spaced with 6 feet between the inner rails of the ways. This interspace is popularly known as the “six-foot.”

The benefits derived from the use of the tramway or railway for the transport of coal suggested to reflective persons the employment of it for the conveyance of general merchandise and of passengers. For the conveyance of heavy merchandise inland the canals little more than sixty years ago furnished the principal means. Though there were three such water-routes between Liverpool and Manchester, they were sometimes so crowded that cotton took a month to pass from the seaport to the manufacturing towns in the interior; yet the whole of the merchandise passing between Liverpool and Manchester did not average more than 1200 tons a day. The average rate of carriage was 18s. per ton, and the average time of transit on the 50 miles of canal was thirty-six hours. The conveyance of passengers by the improved coach-roads was comparatively rapid, but it was very costly. The first great movement to mend this state of things was the passing of the Act in 1821 for the construction of the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Colliery railways were in evidence to prove the benefits of railway communication by steam-power. The Hetton Railway, for instance, in the neighbourhood of Newcastle, from the colliery to the river Wear, was 7 miles long, and trains of 60 tons net weight were taken over the line at a speed of 44 miles per hour. On the Killingworth Railway an engine and tender weighing 10 tons drew a load of 40 tons at a speed of 6 miles per hour, consuming 50 fl> of coal per mile run. Whilst animal-power only was at first relied on for working the Stockton and Darlington

Railway, the Act provided for working with men and horses or “otherwise.” By another Act applied for at the request of George Stephenson, who became engineer to the line, the company was empowered to work the railway with locomotive engines. The line, with three branches, was over 38 miles in length, and was at first laid as a single line, with passing places at intervals of a quarter of a mile, the way being constructed with wrought-iron fish belly rails, weighing 28 ft> per yard. It was opened in September 1825 by a train of thirty-four vehicles, making a gross load of about 90 tons, drawn by one engine driven by Stephenson, with a signalman on horseback in advance. The train moved off at the rate of from 10 to 12 miles an hour, and attained a speed of 15 miles per hour on favourable parts of the line. A train weighing 92 tons could be drawn by one engine at the rate of 5 miles per hour. The principal business of the new railway was the conveyance of minerals and goods, but from the first passengers insisted upon being carried, and in October 1825 the company began to run a daily coach, called the “Experiment,” to carry six inside, and from fifteen to twenty outside, making the journey from Darlington to Stockton and back in two hours. The fare was Is., and each passenger was allowed to take baggage not exceeding 14 Bb weight. The rate for carriage of merchandise was reduced from 5d. to one-fifth of a penny per ton per mile, and that of minerals from 7d. to Hd. per ton per mile. The price of coals at Darlington fell from 18s. to 8s. 6d. per ton.

The Monklands Railway in Scotland, opened in 1826, was the first to follow the example of the Stockton and Darlington line, and several other small lines—including the Canterbury and Whitstable, worked partly by fixed engines and partly by locomotives—quickly adopted steam-traction. But the inauguration of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, opened in 1829, made the first great impression on the national mind that a revolution in the modes of travelling had really taken place. In 1838 a line was opened between London and Birmingham, and the first train accomplished the whole distance—112^ miles—at an average speed of over 20 miles per hour. The London and Greenwich, the London and Southampton, the Great Western, Birmingham and Derby, Bristol and Exeter, Eastern Counties, Manchester and Leeds, Grand Junction, Midland Counties, North Midland, South-Eastern, London and Brighton, Manchester and Birmingham, and Edinburgh and Glasgow, together with many small Bills, were all passed within four years from the time of the passing of the London and Birmingham Bill. Thus in the course of four or five years the foundations were laid of most of the existing trunk lines of railway in Great Britain. The original Liverpool and Manchester line, 3(4 miles in length, now forms part of a network of lines, the property of one company, nearly 1800 miles in extent, representing a capital invested in railway works and plant of <£100,000,000.

Meantime the construction of the way was the subject of much consideration. The fish-belly form of wrought-iron rail was troublesome to roll, and so the flat-bottom or flat-foot rail (fig. 4) was designed, combining a solid head with a flange base. This rail, with holes through the · flange to hold the spikes, was used to some extent, and was laid on longitudinal timber sleepers, and also on transverse sleepers. The disadvantage was want of vertical stiffness of the system; and, if the rail was made higher, it was liable to rock on the sleeper and work loose on the spikes. This rail, known as the Yignoles rail, has been much improved in form and proportions and is extensively used. The bridge rail (fig. 5)—so called [9:20:225]because it was first laid on bridges—was that first used on the Great Western Railway, and is of a shallow section, but wide, and possessed of lateral stiffness. The first line was a series of beech piles, 12 inches square, driven into the ground, to which were bolted at the surface level cross balks of timber, one on each side of the pilehead on which they were shouldered. Longitudinal balks, 15 feet long, were laid on the cross balks. The longitudinals were covered with oak or elm planking screwed down to the surface. When the ballast was packed under the longitudinal balks, the surface of the oak planks was planed level, and the bridge rails screwed down on them, with felt between. It was supposed that there would be no yielding whatever, but a very short time demonstrated that the piles formed a series of solid resistances, while the balks between sprang, and it was found necessary to cut away the piles. Transoms were then framed into the longitudinals and secured by strap-bolts, and the whole resembled a long ladder laid on the ground. Eight different sections of rails were tried in succession; one section measured l¿ inches in height by 7 inches in width, weighing 41 lb per yard; and the last section 2f inches high by 6 inches wide, weighing 62 K) per yard. The screws which held down the rails were counter-sunk beneath the wheel-flanges, and nut-headed on the other side (see fig. 6). In consequence of the want of depth in the rails, they bent longitudinally under the wheels, and the horizontal flanges curled up at the sides, while the holes through them bent into angles. One remedy tried was to cross-board the longitudinal timbers on the surface, and thus the fibre was made less yielding.

The double-headed rail (fig. 7) was originated by Joseph Locke, and was first laid on the Grand Junction Railway. It also weighed 62 lb per yard. The two tables were equal; the rail was more easily rolled than others, and, being reversible, it was in fact two rails in one. But as it was laid in cast-iron chairs the lower table was exposed to damage under the hammering of the traffic; and many engineers were led to make the lower table of smaller size, as in fig. 8, merely as a support, not as a surface to be used by the wheels. This rail, which acquired the title of “bull-headed,” was, like the flat-foot and bridge rails, used as a prop supported on its base. There was a waste of metal in these early rails, both flat-foot and double-headed, owing to the excessive thickness of the vertical web, which has been corrected in recent designs.

It was found, naturally, that rails would not rest in their chairs at the joints, but were loosened and bruised at the ends by the blows of the traffic. The fish-joint was therefore devised in 1847 by Mr W.

Bridges Adams, the intention being by “fishing” the joints to convert the rails into continuous beams. In the original design two chairs were placed, one under each rail, a few inches apart, as in fig. 9. The joint was thus suspended between the two chairs, and two keys of iron, called “fishes,” fitting the side channels of the rails, were driven in on each side between the chairs and the rails. In subsequent modifications the fishes were, and they continue to be, bolted to and through the rails, the sleepers being placed further apart, and the joint suspended between them.

In the employment of steam-power for traction on railways rapid progress was made in response to the demand for power. The year 1829 is famous in the annals of railways not only for the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester line but for the invention and construction of the first high-speed locomotive of the standard modern type. Robert Stephenson’s engine, the “Rocket,” was made under competition for the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, and it gained the prize for lightness, power, and speed awarded by the directors. The two steam-cylinders of the “Rocket” w־ere 8 inches in diameter, with 164 inches of stroke, and the driving-wheels were 4 feet 8| inches in diameter. The engine weighed 4 tons 5 cwt., the tender following it 3 tons 4 cwt., and two loaded carriages drawn by it on the trial 9 tons 11 cwt.: thus the weight drawn was 12 tons 15 cwt., and the gross total 17 tons. The pressure of steam in the boiler was 50 ft> per square inch. An average speed of 14 miles per hour was attained, the greatest velocity being 29 miles per hour; and the boiler evaporated 18^ cubic feet, or 114 gallons, of water per hour. The “Rocket” possessed the three elements of efficiency of the modern locomotive,—the internal water-surrounded fire-box and the multitubular flue in the boiler, or a number of small tubes in place of one large tube; the blast-pipe, by which the waste steam of the engine was exhausted up the chimney; and the direct connexion of the two steam-cylinders, one on each side of the engine, with the driving or propelling wheels, on one axle. The subdivision of the single large flue, up to that time in general use in locomotives, into a number of small tubes greatly accelerated the generation of steam without adding to the size or weight of the boiler. But the evaporating tubes would have been of little avail practically had they not been supplemented by the blast-pipe, which, by ejecting the steam from the engine after it had done its work in the cylinder straight up the chimney, excited a strong draught through the boiler and caused a brisk and rapid combustion of fuel and generation of heat. The heat was absorbed with proportional rapidity through the newly applied heating-tubes. The blast-pipe, thus applied, in conjunction with the multitubular flue, vastly improved the capacity and usefulness of the locomotive. And, taking into account the direct connexion of the steam-cylinder with one axle and pair of wheels, the improvements were tantamount to a new and original machine. The “Rocket” subsequently drew an average gross load of 40 tons behind the tender at a speed of 133־ miles per hour. The old Killingworth engine, one of the earlier type of locomotives constructed by George Stephenson, weighing with its tender 10 tons, could only work at a maximum of 6 miles per hour with 50 tons.

For many years engines belonged to two general classes. In one class there were six wheels, of which one pair was placed behind the boiler, typified in the engines of the day made by Robert Stephenson; in the other class there were but four wheels, placed under the barrel of the boiler, leaving the fire-box overhung, typified in the engines made by Bury for the London and Birmingham Railway. Experience demonstrated the disadvantage of an overhanging mass, with a very limited wheel-base, in the four-wheeled engine running at high speed; and now it is the general [9:20:226]practice to apply six wheels at least to all ordinary locomotive stock. The earliest four-wheeled locomotive constructed by Robert Stephenson and Co. as an article of regular manufacture weighed 9 tons in working order. The six-wheeled engines which followed weighed 11J tons. In the course of business locomotives of greater power and greater weight were constructed; and there are locomotives of the present time which weigh 47∣ tons in working order, and with the tender full of water and coal about 80 tons gross. There are other engines of special design with twelve wheels which weigh in working order, with fuel and water, 72 tons. The contrast is emphasized in the history of the old Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway, which was opened about the year 1829. The first engines of that line weighed from 8 to 9 tons. They had steam-cylinders 11 inches in diameter, and 4-feet wheels of cast-iron, with a working pressure in the boiler of 50 lb per square inch. The “Garnkirk” engine used to take a train of three carriages, together weighing 7 tons gross, at the average speed of 16 miles per hour between Glasgow and Gartsherrie. When the old line, 8 miles in length, was merged in the Caledonian Railway, now comprising a system of nearly 1000 miles in length, the power of the engines was greatly increased, and at this day (1885) there are express passenger engines working over the same ground having large cylinders of 17 or 18 inches in diameter, and wheels of 7 and 8 feet in diameter, weighing from 35 to 45 tons. These engines, with steam of 120 R> pressure per square inch, take a gross load of 90 tons at a speed of from 40 to 50 miles per hour.

Statistics. Length of Railways in the United Kingdom.— The length of railways open for traffic at the end of the year 1854, twenty-five years after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, was 8053 miles (of which nearly one-fourth was single line of way), costing about £35,500 per mile. In 1874 that mileage was doubled (16,449 miles, nearly one-half being only single line), costing about £37,000 per mile. According to the latest published return the length of railways open for traffic at the end of 1883 amounted to 18,681 miles, and the proportion of single line had decreased, being under 46 per cent. Whilst the mileage open was increased at the rate of 420 miles a year during the earlier period (1854-74), it was only increased by 248 miles a year during the later period (1874-83). But many miles of way in multiple have been laid for the working of traffic concentrated on main lines,—127 miles of triple line and 285 of quadruple. The largest share of multiple way belongs to the London and North-Western Railway Company, which owns 28 miles of triple way and no less than 114 of quadruple. The principal section of this railway, 80 miles in length, between London and Rugby, is entirely in quadruple,—two lines for goods and two for passenger traffic. Table I. shows the distribution of the 18,681 miles of railway open at the end of 1883 :—
[table]

The railways here represented were owned by 281 companies (206 in England and Wales, 31 in Scotland, and 44 in Ireland). But the whole property is worked by 123 companies. ^[2.]

The longest mileage of railway worked by one company is that of the Great Western Railway, which at the end of 1883 was 2268 miles. Next to this ranks the London and North-Western (1793), then the North-Eastern (1534), the Midland (1381), the North-British (1006), and the Caledonian (877). The three longest mileages in Ireland owned each by one company are those of the Great Northern (503), the Great Southern and Western (478), and the Midland Great Western (425). The four largest English companies, taken together, work nearly 7000 miles of railway,—more than half of the whole length of railways in England and Wales. The two leading lines in Scotland, taken together, work nearly 1900, or two-thirds of the whole length of railways in Scotland. In

Ireland the three leading lines, taken together, work 1400,—more than half of the whole length of railways in Ireland.

Capital Invested, Expenditure per Mile, &c.—The capital raised' for the construction of railways at the end of the year 1883: amounted to about £785,000,000, representing an expenditure of £42,000 per mile open. Some small portion of this cost belongs to lines in course of construction. The money has been raised in the following proportions :—
[table]

In 1857 the ordinary stock was 57 per cent., as against 37’4 per cent, in 1883; and the guaranteed and preferential stock together were but one-third of the ordinary share capital, while in 1883 they equalled it. The English railway system, so far as capital is concerned, has become adjusted to the rule of having rather less than 40 per cent, of the capital in “open stock.” In 1845-46 the dividends of railways appear to have reached a maximum. The precipitate influx of new lines during the four years from 1846 to 1850, contests before parliament, competition in various forms, and other causes then came in to depress dividends, and reduced the average proportion of net receipts in 1849 to 2 , 83 per cent, of the total capital and loans raised at that time. In 1857 the percentage of net receipts had risen again to 4’06 per cent, of the total capital and loans; and notwithstanding the accumulation of preference capital and loans, both taking precedence of ordinary capital, the available dividend on the latter increased from 1 , 88 per cent, to 3'6 per cent. Since that time the average dividend paid on ordinary capital has maintained its level at least, and it amounted for 1883 to 4'68 per cent. The average cost per mile open at the end of 1883, calculated on the amount of capital raised, with that for 1857 added for comparison, was as follows (Table II.) :—
[table]

The marked increase in capital expenditure per mile is due to permanent improvements, station accommodation, reconstruction, and multiplication of lines. Of the great cost of English railways, independently of the permanent improvements already noticed, part lias been incurred in parliamentary warfare, while much of it is due to great and costly termini, and to the character of the earlier works of construction in England, where great expenditure was incurred for the sake of securing long levels and very easy gradients, until Joseph Locke made a new departure, and constructed the Grand Junction Railway on economic principles by following in great part the contour of the surface. For this line and the London and Birmingham line, for which Robert Stephenson was the engineer, Acts were passed in the same year (1833). The latter line was expensively laid out with tunnels, viaducts, and heavy cuttings and embankments, and cost in round numbers £53,600 per mile, as against £23,200 per mile for Locke’s line. The cheaper line abounded in inclines of from 1 in 85 to 1 in 265, whilst the more expensive line was ruled by gradients not steeper than 1 in 330. Locke reckoned upon the sufficiency of the engine-power to take the trains up the inclines, and the famous Crewe engine was the outgrowth of the situation. The London and South-Western Railway, which cost £26,800 per mile, was laid out by Locke to a ruling gradient of 1 in 250. There are other instances of economical construction by the same engineer in the original Caledonian and Scottish Central Railways—now amalgamated—the former of which was made with long gradients of 1 in 75, 1 in 80, 1 in 100, and other steep slopes. Besides these there are other cheaply made railways in Scotland; but there is only one Scottish railway of the monumental class,—the Edinburgh and Glasgow, nearly dead level, with enormously expensive works. On the Metropolitan Railway system, 22 miles in length, upwards of £11,000,000 have been paid up, or about £500,000 per mile. The enormous cost of this line, as well as of the Metropolitan District system (18 miles long, costing £374,000 per mile) and the North London system (12 miles long, costing £325,000 per mile), is sufficiently explained by the place and conditions. The original London and Blackwall Railway, built, like the North London, for the most part on arches, cost £311,912 per mile. The original Birkenhead, Cheshire, and Lancashire Junction Railway, now vested in the neighbouring railway companies, cost upwards of £75,000 per mile, owing partly to the protracted contests in which it had been involved with the neighbouring railways, and partly to the costly works of construction joining the railway to the docks at Birkenhead. Of railways in England, the original Carlisle and Silloth [9:20:227]Railway, 13 miles long, has the honour of standing at the foot of the list, having cost £6474 per mile. Of the Scottish lines the Caledonian system stands at the head of the list, costing £45,500 per mile. The North British system cost £33,000 per mile. At the foot of the list stood the original East of Fife line, 7 miles long, with a cost of £4351 per mile. But the cheapest lines of considerable length are the Forth and Clyde line, costing £5525 per mile, and the Peebles line, costing £5545 per mile. Both these lines have been taken into the North British system. In Ireland the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, 8 miles long, a suburban railway, cost £53,000 per mile. The original Limerick and Foynes line, costing £5282 per mile, is probably the cheapest piece of railway in the United Kingdom.

The proportions of expenditure on capital account cannot in the absence of data be exactly determined. The following may be accepted as an approximate analysis of the average cost of the railways. as it stood in 1871
[table]

From this estimate it would appear that the net cost of construction and equipment was £21,000 per mile, or about 58 per cent, of the entire cost. The capital cost of the working stock is given by the London and North-Western Railway Company. Excluding a considerable number of engines and carrying stock which had been constructed as duplicate stock—charged to revenue, no doubt —at 31st December 1884 the quantities ana costs were as follows :—
[table]

It is to be explained with reference to these low rates of cost that the original cost of the early working stock stands unaltered in the books of the company, whilst the whole of the original working stock has been replaced at the charge of revenue by engines and vehicles of modern design and larger capacity. Divided by the number of miles (1793) open at 31st December 1884, the total charge for working stock is at the rate of £4680 per mile open. For new working stock manufactured by the same company during the eighteen months ending 31st December 1884 the following average sums were charged to capital :—
[table]

Working or Rolling Stock. — The working or rolling stock of railways consists of locomotives with their tenders, passenger carriages, horse-boxes, carriage trucks, travelling post-offices with their tenders and vans, goods waggons, covered goods waggons, cattle trucks, coke and coal waggons, timber trucks, ballast waggons, and goods brake vans. Table III. (below) shows that in England and Wales there is nearly one locomotive per mile of line open, or for the United Kingdom three engines for every 4 miles. The greatest waggon stock per mile open is to be found in Scotland—nearly thirty-one per mile. The proportions of vehicles for traffic of all classes for each locomotive averaged at the end of the year 1883 :—
[table]

The excessive proportion of fifty-two vehicles per engine in Scotland corresponds to the comparatively excessive number of train miles with goods and minerals, which are 20 per cent, more than the passenger-train miles, whilst in England they are 8 per cent, less, and in Ireland more than 50 per cent. less. The various proportions of rolling stock for twenty-one leading British railways (31st December 1883) are exhibited in detail in Table IV., arranged in the order of the numerical proportions which the carrying stock for traffic bears to the locomotive stock :—
[table]

Here the number of vehicles varies from 5 per engine on the Metropolitan Railway, 7 on the District Raihvay, and 11 "7 on the North London Railway—all of these specially passenger lines of dense traffic—to 54 per engine on the North-Eastern Railway, 59 on the North British Railway, and 65 on the Caledonian Railway—all these being specially lines of mineral traffic.

Train Miles Run, 1883.— The number of miles run by passenger and goods and mineral trains, and the number run by mixed trains, are as follows (Table V.) :—
[table]

The mixed-train miles constitute just 1 per cent, of the total number, and the mileages run by passenger and goods trains are nearly equal. On an average each mile of way was traversed forty times a day. Taking the means of the numbers of engines for the end of 1882 and the end of 1883 as the average number during the year, the train miles run per locomotive are as follows (Table VI. ) :—
[table]

An engine when actually on duty may accomplish 120 train miles
[table]
[9:20:228]

per day, which would make upwards of 40,000 per annum. But at any moment half the engines may be taken as in reserve or under repair, which reduces the average performance per engine of the whole stock to some 20,000 miles per year, and the circumstances of many lines do not admit of such high averages of mileage run. Taking the twenty-one leading lines in detail, following the selection already made to show the quantities of working stock, the number of train, miles run on the different lines in 1883 is shown in Table VII. as follows :—
[table]

Table VIII.— Duties performed by Engines of Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway.
[table]

In general the lines of preponderating passenger-train miles run the greater number of miles per engine. The small mileage per engine of the London and North-Western line, with a relatively small goods-train mileage, is partly explained by the fact that this company had 141 duplicate locomotives in 1883. Engines run many miles unavoidably “empty,”—that is, without a train, the proportion of the empty or unprofitable mileage depending on the traffic and the nature of the line. A line with locally heavy gradients must have “assistant” or “pilot” engines in readiness to assist the trains up the inclines, and such engines usually have to return empty to the depot; and in cases of special trains empty engines are run to or from the train, as the case may happen. Engines, especially assistant engines, may have to stand “in steam” or with the steam up and the fire in good order, in readiness to act when required. Some railway companies register the whole time the engines are in steam, also the assistant, ballasting, and empty mileage run, besides the time on active duty and the train miles run. The nature of the duty of goods engines, which is various, is also distinguished, so as, in short, to make a complete record of the work done. Thus for the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Table VIII. (see above) gives the duties performed by the engines during the second half-years of 18S7 and 1883. The times of engines assisting and running empty are included in the hours in steam with trains,—passenger and goods respectively. There were about 170 engines employed in shunting and marshalling trains. The relative percentages of the hours the engines were in steam and of miles run on different duties in the second half-year of 1883 are given in Table IX. :—
[table]

The proportion of extra engine mileage to the work done in hauling goods, minerals, and passengers varies very much on different systems, according to the nature of the traffic, for by far the greater part of it arises in connexion with goods and minerals, which itself is a very varying quantity. The train mile, therefore, —that is, the revenue-producing train mile—though it is the simplest and handiest unit of performance, is not an absolute measure of work done. The shunting or marshalling of trains is an item not indicated by train mileage, and yet it is hard work and occupies as many hours in steam as the train mileage. Again, the fuel consumed, reckoned only on the train mileage run, amounts to 53 lb per mile run; but, reckoned on the total mileage run by engines, in which the extra mileage, whether ballasting, shunting, or assisting, is hard work, it amounts only to 41 lb per mile run.

On the London and North-Western Railway in 1874 the total shunting time was 613,472 hours of one engine—about the same as on the Sheffield line in 1883—and on this work 171 engines were constantly employed, marshalling and classifying the trains in the sidings. A like number, so employed on the Sheffield line, amount to one-third of the total locomotive stock.

Traffic.— Before the establishment of the railway from twenty to thirty coaches'ran daily between Manchester and Liverpool, whereas the railway carried 700,000 passengers during its first eighteen months. Wherever railways were made the carriage of passengers was found to be one of the most remunerative sources of traffic. Nearly fifty years ago Porter, in his Progress of the Nation (1836), estimated that in Great Britain 82,000 persons daily, or 30,000,000 per annum, travelled by coach an average distance of about 12 miles each, at an average cost of 5s. for each passenger, or 5d. per mile, whereas in 1881 upwards of 600,000,000 passengers travelled by railway at a cost, taking averages, of 10⅜d. each, which at the average rate of say 1⅛d. per mile travelled would represent an average length of 8⅜ miles, at one-fourth of the cost and in one-third of the time required by coach.

Table X. shows the total number of passengers of each class conveyed in 1883 :—
[table]

The proportions of passengers, independent of season-ticket holders, were as follows (Table XI.) :—
[9:20:229]
[table]

The number of passengers conveyed in the year 1883 per mile of the mean length of railway open during the year was, in England 46,340, in Scotland 17,550, and in Ireland 7710.

The receipts from passenger traffic in 1883 are given in Table XII. (see below). The decided preponderance of third-class traffic shown in this table is the outcome of the work of years. In 1854 upwards of 111 million passengers travelled by railway, of whom 13 per cent, travelled by first, 34 by second, and 53 by third class and parliamentary carriages. In 1873, the year before the Midland Railway Company ceased to carry second-class passengers, upwards of 455 million passengers travelled by railway, of whom only 8½ per cent, travelled by first, 15 by second, and 76½ by third class carriages. In 1881 upwards of 623 million passengers travelled by railway, nearly six times as many as in 1854. Of these only 6 per cent, were first and 10½ second class passengers, whilst the third-class and parliamentary passengers rose to 83½. Finally, in 1883 (as already stated in Table XI. ), 85 per cent, of the passengers were third class. The same movement is exemplified in the receipts, the mass of receipts gravitating towards third class, as shown by the following abstract per mile open for the years already mentioned (Table XIII.)
[table]

These figures show that in 1854 first and second class receipts together made up two-thirds of the whole receipts from passengers, but that they steadily declined in succeeding years, not only proportionally but absolutely,—the third-class receipts, on the contrary, exhibiting a rapid increase, insomuch that, whereas in 1854 they were exactly one-third of the whole receipts, in 1883 they amounted to more than two-thirds of the whole receipts from passengers. The reaction in first-class receipts is all the more remarkable because the number of first-class passengers in 1854—14½ millions—was nearly trebled in 1873; that of 1873 was almost exactly the same as in 1881,—about 38 millions; -whilst in 1883 there were nearly 36½ millions. The explanation is probably to be sought partly in the fact that first-class fares have been reduced in many cases and express fares have been almost entirely abolished, and partly to the increased habit of taking third class for long journeys, so that first-class journeys, being shorter on the average, have become less remunerative to the companies than before. The third class is by far the most remunerative portion of the passenger traffic of railways; and it is difficult to understand the policy still pursued by railway companies in France, of discouraging third-class traffic. On those railways where fast trains do not take third-class passengers, or third-class carriages are deterrently uncomfortable and repulsive, only those travel who travel by necessity, or to whom money is no object. On the contrary, low fares and comfortable carriages invite traffic; they may almost be said to create it,—a fact which has long been recognized by the more intelligent of railway managers. The high speed of express trains —from 45 to 50 miles and upwards per hour—is, of course, an additional inducement to travel. On certain lines there are only two classes of carriages,—first and third. The Caledonian Railway Company was the first to adopt, about thirty-five years ago, the system of two classes only for local main-line passenger traffic. The Great North of Scotland Railway Company opened its line in 1854 with only first and third class carriages. The Midland Railway Company, as already noticed, ceased in 1874 to run second-

class carriages, at the same time readjusting and lowering the fares, —the revised rates being 1½d. and 1d. respectively per mile for first and third class. The result was that in 1875 27∣ million passengers travelled on this railway,—nearly 5 millions more than in 1873, before the change was made; whilst in 1881 there were 29 million travellers, of whom -27 millions were third and only 2 millions first class passengers; and in 1883 upwards of 31 million passengers were carried, of whom 29½ millions were of the third and a little over 1¾millions of the first class. The gross receipts for passenger traffic on the Midland Railway were, in round numbers, £1,660,000 in 1873, £1,787,000 in 1881, and £1,904,000 in 1883, whilst the percentage of working expenditure remained the same. On the whole, it appears from the results of this grand experiment that the change has succeeded financially, whilst there is no doubt that it has stimulated the provision for and development of third-class travelling on other railways. The gravitation of traffic to the lowest level is unquestionable; and it is aided by the fact that third-class carriages have been (1885) for some years run with nearly all trains, fast as well as slow, and that the largeness of the number of third-class passengers has forced upon the management of the companies improvements in the popular class of carriage. As the downward movement of the classes continues the outcome will most likely be a general reduction of the number of classes to two,—nominally first and third, practically first and second. On 1st May 1885 second-class carriages were abolished on the branch lines of the Great Northern Railway; and, if the experiment answers expectations, second-class carriages will be abolished on the entire Great Northern system.

The returns to the Board of Trade do not supply material for close analysis of goods traffic. The quantities of minerals and goods or general merchandise conveyed in 1883 were as follows (Table XIV.)
[table]

The receipts from mineral and goods traffic in 1883 are given in

Table XV.
[table]

These statistics of merchandise and mineral traffic show that upwards of 266 million tons were conveyed in 1883 in the United Kingdom, seven-tenths of which were minerals. In 1857 71 million tons were conveyed, of which only two-thirds consisted of minerals; whence it appears that a more rapid development of mineral traffic than of general merchandise took place in the interval.

The whole of the receipts directly earned on the railways in 1883, with the miscellaneous receipts derived from rents, tolls, navigation, steamboats, &c., are brought together in Table XVI. (see below). The receipts per train mile from passengers and from goods and mineral traffic are reckoned exclusive of the receipts on railways working mixed trains; but all the receipts per train mile for passengers and goods together are divided by the total mileage run by all trains. In the last column the gross receipts, including miscellaneous receipts, are divided by the total train mileage.
[table]
[9:20:230]
[table]

Of the total receipts for passengers and. goods, goods brought 56'8 per cent, and passengers 43‘2. In 1857 the proportions were nearly the same,—56 and 44 per cent, respectively. For the three kingdoms separately the percentages for 1883 were (Table Xλ r II. ) :—
[table]

The average traffic receipts per mile open in 1883 were distributed between the three kingdoms as shown in Table XVIII. :—
[table]

These quantities for 1883 are proportionally for the three kingdoms as 4, 21, 1. For the year 1857 the corresponding amounts were as 3, 2, 1, so that the growth of traffic in the interval has been greater in England than in Scotland, and greater in Scotland than in Ireland.

Table XIX. (below) contains a summary of the expenditure of the railways of the United Kingdom for the year 1883, with the rate of expenditure of different kinds per mile open and per train mile run, and, in addition, the proportional expenditure of the different kinds in parts of the total working expenditure. The heads of expenditure are classified in this table in order to separate direct or really working expenditure from what may be called contingent or incidental expenditure not essential to the working of a railway, as rates, duty, compensation, &c. The direct or essential working expenditure is thus upwards of 32 millions sterling, or 86 per cent, of the whole expenditure. The amount and proportion of the net receipts are shown by deducting the total working expenditure from the total receipts, as under :—
[table]

The net receipts available for payment of dividend are equal to 4 - 29 per cent, on the paid-up capital, and they were disposed for 1883 in the following fashion :—
[table]

The total distribution, it appears, exceeded the available net receipts for the year by nearly £1,000,000. In explanation of the
[table]
[9:20:231]

apparent discrepancy it may be stated that some companies had invested a portion of their capital in the stocks and shares of other companies; that interest is occasionally paid on the capital of companies whose lines are not open for traffic; and that interest on loan capital is not always paid out of net earnings. The appropriation of the gross receipts to working expenditure and dividends, according to the tabulated statement of expenditure, is summarily as follows, in parts of the gross receipts :—

Per cent.

Maintenance of way, works, &c.....»......... 9 - 5

Locomotive power............................13 , 1

Maintenance of carriages and waggons ........ 4∙6

Traffic expenses ..............................15 - 8

General charges.............................. 2 - 3

Direct expenditure on working............45'3

Contingent expenditure on working ...... 7‘3

Total working expenditure................ 52 ∙6

Payments of interest and dividends........ 47 ∙4

Gross receipts............................ 100

The statistics of traffic returns of railways in the United Kingdom since 1842 indicate a remarkably steady and rapid increase of traffic. L In 1842 the total receipts amounted to upwards of £4,250,000. In . 1852 they were nearly £16,000,000, and during the thirty-one years following thev are given at intervals as in Table XX. :—
[table]

Thus the receipts were quadrupled during the thirty years from 1853 to 1883, whilst the mileage of railway open was increased by two and a half times. The receipts per mile increased notwithstanding their continual dilution by the accession of new lines. These results, taken together, indicate the inherent elasticity of the railway and its seemingly inexhaustible resources.

Of the main trunk-lines, which constitute the foundation of the railway system, those which converge towards and terminate in London—the metropolitan lines—are more important than the provincial lines. London is the great heart of the country and is the chief centre of commerce; moreover, the metropolitan railways, taken together, possess a greater variety of traffic than others; hence they are selected for discussion illustrative of the growing magnitude and distribution of traffic. On the nine metropolitan railways, including the London and Black wall and the North London, in operation in 1854-57, Table XXI. shows the receipts for these four years; and the receipts for the year 1883 derived from the twelve metropolitan companies then in operation are added for comparison :—
[table]

In the early years—1856, for instance—the metropolitan railway mileage open constituted one-third of the total mileage open, whilst it produced nearly one-half of the total traffic receipts of the United Kingdom, insomuch that the receipts per metropolitan mile were two-fifths more than the average total receipts per mile. Recently—in 1883—though the metropolitan mileage open was less than one-half of the total mileage open of the United Kingdom, it earned six-tenths of the total receipts; and the receipts per metropolitan mile were one-third more than the average total on the whole mileage of the country. Lastly, the increase of receipts of the metropolitan lines is greater than that of the entire system. Whether, therefore, the increase of receipts be compared with the total receipts or with the mileage open, the traffic of the metropolitan railways increases the most rapidly, and it is also of the greatest absolute magnitude. But, to bring out clearly the relative importance and progress of the traffic of different districts, let us separate what may be distinguished as the coast lines to the south and east of the metropolis—the Great Eastern, and the railways south of the Thames—from the interior lines to the north and west, the Great Northern, Midland, North-Western, Great Western, and the three local lines, the North London, Metropolitan, and District. The receipts may be correspondingly classified and compared with the receipts in other parts of the United Kingdom (Table XXII.):—
[table]

This comparative statement shows some strong contrasts. In 1857 the densest traffic in England, averaging £86,10s., over 1515 miles lay to the north and west of the metropolis; the railway traffic of the country was very partially distributed; and, taking London as the great focus, the traffic radiated and converged in all directions, with decreasing intensity as the distance from the centre increased. In the year 1883, on the contrary, whilst the metropolitan traffic continued to be the densest, the traffic of the metropolitan coast lines per mile open had advanced so rapidly as even to surpass that of the interior metropolitan lines,—the receipts being £98 per mile per week against £96. The rapid development of the southern lines passenger traffic is, as will be shown, the cause of the great advance in receipts. Further insight into the comparative conditions of interior and coast lines may be got by taking four great inland lines (Great Northern, Great Western, Midland, and London and North-Western), which are lines of preponderating goods and mineral traffic, and contrasting them with four great coast lines of preponderating passenger traffic (South-Eastern; London, Brighton, and South Coast; London, Chatham, and Dover; and South-Western). In the annexed table (XXIII.) for 1883 the average fare per passenger is calculated on the assumption that the fares formed 80 per cent, of the whole receipts for passenger trains, and the average length of a passenger’s journey is got by taking 85 per cent, of the passengers as third class at Id. a mile and 15 per cent, as first and second class at 1∣d. a mile.
[table]

The coast lines, being freer from competition, get higher rates both for goods and passengers; but the inland lines have the advantage in direct working expenditure per train mile, and a still greater advantage in the much smaller capital raised per mile of line open, so that, in spite of competition and low rates, they earn 5∣ per cent, on their capital as against a little over 4⅛ earned by the coast lines. The greater capital outlay on the coast railways seems to be due to the costliness of stations and carriage stock for a preponderating passenger traffic; and as this more than outweighs the gains from higher rates the statistics support the generally accepted opinion that goods and mineral traffic on railways is profitable and should be encouraged and developed. Mr R. Price Williams, an accepted authority on railway statistics, supports this conclusion. Mr F. R. Conder, on the contrary, who has deeply studied the question, maintains that the heavy mineral traffic of railways should be relegated to the canals, which, though slow, are low in their charges.

Emploijés.— In 1856 Robert Stephenson estimated that 1 per cent, of the population of the United Kingdom was maintained [9:20:232]by the railways then in operation, independently of the considerable amount of labour employed on railways in course of construction. On 31st March 1884 railway employés numbered in all 367,793 persons, or 19 , 69 per mile open, showing an increase of more than 50 per cent, on the proportion per mile in 1857, which was only 12 , 63. Table XXIV. gives details :—
[table]

From this table it may be estimated that there are now two drivers and two firemen for every 3 miles of line open. In 1857 there were only two drivers and two firemen for every 5 miles; and, though the train service has increased faster than the train mileage, the work of the drivers has sensibly diminished, each man on an average doing 20,950 miles as against 23,420 in 1857.

Railway Construction.

The selection of lines of railway is mainly governed by the same principles as hold good for roads, but the cost of the rails renders it of greater importance to shorten the length of the route than to make slight savings in embankments and cuttings. The first step in the survey is to ascertain the positions of the watercourse and watershed lines of the district to be passed through. The general direction having been selected by the help of an ordnance map, a sketch-map, or a special reconnaissance survey, the river-crossings are to be examined and decided upon, and the points determined at which the watersheds are to be crossed and the approaches to bridges set out. Trial lines should be run between the points thus fixed, and the country should be carefully examined on each side of these before the route is finally decided on. Sharp curves and steep gradients are in themselves evils, involving special cost for maintenance and for working, although original outlay may be economized by the adoption of them. A straight and horizontal surface is assumed as the standard of perfection; and the proper business of the engineer in laying out a railway is to harmonize the engineering and the financial conditions of the problem so as to yield the highest practicable return on the money expended, and to see that, whilst the railway may be neither quite straight nor quite level, it shall not be unduly costly in construction from excessive cutting, tunnelling, and making of embankments, in order to obviate severe curves and gradients, nor excessively cheap from following the surface of the ground too closely and incurring heavy gradients and severe curves, and as a consequence heavy working expenditure.

Cuttings and Embankments. — Engineers endeavour so to plan the works of a railway that the quantity of earth to be excavated shall be equal to the quantity that goes to form the embankments. The earthwork is the foundation and support of the superstructure, and as such it must be uniformly firm, of liberal width, easy slopes, thorough drainage. Figs. 10 and 11 are type-sections of cuttings and embankments for a double line of way on the national gaιme, showing the “formation” surface and the ballast on which the permanent way is supported, with the slopes, the side drains, and the fencing. Fig. 12 is a type-section of the permanent way on the national gauge, settled by Mr John Fowler for the South Wales Railway. Upon the formation level the ballast is deposited, 2 feet in depth at the centre, dressed level, for about 22 feet in width for a double line of way. The sleepers and chairs are buried in the ballast, and the rails partially also, these standing 2 or 3 inches above the ballast. The intermediate space between the two lines of way is, as before stated, 6 feet, and, taking the lengths of the sleepers at 9 feet, the total width for two lines of way over the sleepers is 6 feet + 4 feet 8½ inches + 2½ inches × 2 (width of the rails) + 9 feet = 20 feet 1½ inches; and it is seen that, as the ballast is 22 feet wide at the upper surface, it extends to nearly 1 foot beyond the ends of the sleeper at each side and about 3½ feet beyond the outer rails at each side.

The slopes of cuttings vary according to stratification, soil, direction of the vein, moisture. In gravel, sand, or common earth the slopes rise 1 foot for 1 to 1½ or 2 feet of base; in solid rock the slopes are nearly vertical. Cuttings are as deep as from 50 to 100 feet below the surface, and embankments as high above. The London and Birmingham Railway had upwards of 12 million cubic yards of excavation, and 10½ millions of excavation in the original estimates, or above 100,000 cubic yards of earthwork per mile. The heaviest cutting on the line is at Tring, 2½ miles long, averaging 40 feet deep, the greatest depth being 60. In the case of the great Blisworth cutting the strata were unequal in consistency. About halfway up the face of the cutting a stratum of limestone rock, 25 feet in thickness, was found, with loose strata below and above it, and it was necessary to prevent the lower stratum, consisting of wet clay, from being forced out under the superincumbent mass by undersetting. A rubble wall, averaging 20 feet in height, was built on each side underneath the rock, strengthened by buttresses at intervals of 20 feet, resting on inverted arches carried across underneath the line. A puddle-drain was formed behind each wall, with a small drain through the wall to let off the water from behind. Fig. 13 is an elevation of the w τ est end of the cutting where it is about 40 feet deep, show-

ing clearly the method of undersetting, and fig.

14 is a cross section of the side walls at the same place, where the left-hand shows a sec tion of the wall in the water, and the right-hand side shows the section through a buttress, together with the invert and drains. One of the walls is shown in front elevation in fig. 15. The New Cross cutting through the London clay, on the South-Eastern Railway, is 2 miles long, and is for some distance from

80 to nearly

100 feet in depth. This cutting affords an example of the tendency of some soils to slip. The slopes of the cutting were finished at 2 horizontal to 1 vertical; and they remained as thus finished for [9:20:233]about two years, when, after continued bad weather, the slopes commenced slipping to such an extent that the line was rendered impassable for some weeks, and parts of the slopes were reduced to an inclination of 4 to 1. The Winchburgh cutting, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, is 4 miles long and from 25 to 60 feet deep, through solid rock. It is succeeded by an embankment 1^ miles long and 60 feet high, followed in immediate succession by a stone viaduct half a mile long and 80 feet high. The Olive Mount cutting of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway is 2 miles long and at some places 100 feet deep.

Perhaps the most interesting case of embankment and cutting in combination is that of the crossing of Chat Moss, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The moss was 44 miles across, and it varied in depth from 10 to 30 feet. Its general character was such that cattle could not stand on it, and a piece of iron would sink in it. The subsoil was composed principally of clay and sand, and the railway had to be carried over the moss on the level, requiring cutting and embanking for upwards of 4 miles. In forming 277,000 cubic yards of embankment 670,000 yards of raw peat were consumed, the difference being occasioned by the squeezing out of the water. Large quantities of embanking were sunk in the moss, and, when the engineer, Stephenson, after a month’s vigorous operations, had made up his estimates, the apparent work done was sometimes less than at the beginning of the month. The railway ultimately was made to float on the bog. Where embankment was required drains about 5 yards apart were cut, and when the moss between them was dry it was used to form the embankment. Where the way was formed on the level drains were cut on each side of the intended line, and were intersected here and there by cross drains, by which the upper part of the moss became dry and firm. On this surface hurdles were placed, 4 feet broad and 9 long, covered with heath, upon which the ballast was laid.

*· Tunnels .—The relative costs of rock - cuttings and cuttings in clay do not greatly differ; for, not only does the vertical rock-cutting require less excavation than the wide yawning earth-cutting of the same depth, with extended slopes, but, when it is executed, the rock-cutting is not liable to the expensive slips which sometimes overtake the other. For depths exceeding 60 feet it is usually cheaper to tunnel.

The tunnel (see fig. 16) under Callander ridge near Falkirk station, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, is a fair representation of tunnels as usually constructed. It is lined with brick 18 inches thick, founded on stone footings of greater breadth, in order to throw the ,load securely upon the subsoil, as shown in the transverse section. The sides and roof of the tunnel are curved from footing to footing, so as effectually to resist the inevitable external pressure of the earth, to a span of 26 feet in width and a height of 22. The sectional view shows also the centering or timber framing employed in the building of the tunnel, which was braced diagonally and transversely to resist the unavoidable inequalities of pressure without alteration of form whilst the arch was in course of construction. Externally the entrances are built of stone, and the flank walls are 3 feet in thickness, with counterforts at intervals. This tunnel is not straight, but is formed on a curve of 1 mile radius, and is 830 yards, or nearly half a mile in length.

The Ivilsby tunnel, on the London and Birmingham Railway, was rendered necessary by the opposition raised to the line passing through Northampton. It is driven 160 feet below the surface and is 2398 yards in length, 30 feet in width, and 30 feet high, constructed with two wide air-shafts 60 feet in diameter, not only to give air and ventilation but to admit light enough to enable the engine-driver in passing through it with a train to see the rails from end to end. The construction of the tunnel was let for the sum of £99,000, but, owing chiefly to the existence of unseen quicksands, the tunnel is stated to have actually cost nearly £300,000, or £125 per lineal yard.

The Box tunnel, on the Great Western Railway, between Bath and Chippenham, was another difficult and expensive work. It is about 70 feet below the surface, and is 3123 yards in length, or rather more than If miles; the width is 30 and the height 25 feet. Where bi'icked, the sides are constructed of seven and the arch of six rings of brick, and there is an invert of four rings. There are eleven air-shafts to this tunnel, generally 25 feet in diameter.

The tunnel under the Mound at Edinburgh (see fig. 17), on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, supplies an excellent illustration of tunnels formed with inverts,— that is to say, inverted arches built under the rails. The figure is a transverse section, showing the truly circular arch of the tunnel,

28 feet in diameter and 20 high above the rails, built of brick 3 feet thick, stiffened with counterforts ex-ternally, and with ribs of masonry internally, founded on a solid bed of mason-work, with an inverted arch to distribute the weight. The

Mound was a mass of loose earth and rubbish on a boggy soil, hence the necessity for the invert arch, on which the tunnel may be conceived to float.

The Shakespeare tunnel, or, more correctly, double tunnel, driven through the Shakespeare Cliff near Dover, on the South-Eastern Railway, is in fact two narrow tunnels, carrying each one line of rails (see fig. 18), 12 feet wide and 30 in extreme height, through the chalk, separated by a solid pier or wall of chalk 10 feet thick. The chalk is of variable quality, and the greater part of the tunnel is lined with brick, strengthened by counterforts at 12 feet intervals, which carry the weight of doubtful beds of chalk. The tunnel is 1430 yards, or upwards of three-quarters of a mile in length, rising westward with an inclination of 1 in 264. The tunnel being within a short distance of the face of the cliff, the material excavated was discharged through galleries about 400 feet long, driven in from the face of the cliff, into the sea,—the first operation being to run a bench or roadway along the face of the cliff. There are seven vertical shafts from the surface, averaging 180 feet deep.

There were in 1857 about 70 miles of railway tunnelling in Great Britain, or 1 mile of tunnel for 130 miles of railway. There are now (1885) probably at least 100 miles of tunnelling. The cost of tunnelling has averaged £102 per mile. The longest tunnel is the Woodhead, at the summit of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway, being 3 miles and 60 feet long. The tun-nelling on the Metropolitan Railway is noticed below, p. 239.

Bridges and Viaducts .—There are very few level crossings on English railways—that is, the crossing of one railway with another, or with a common road, at the same level—the chances of accidents having demanded, in general, the construction of bridges over or under the railway. The general appearance of an ordinary stone or brick bridge is represented by fig. 19, showing in elevation a bridge over or under the railway. The minimum height of a bridge over the railway is ruled by the elevation necessary to clear the top of the chimney of the locomotive. A11 excellent method of carrying roads over railways, where the height is limited and the span is moderate, consists in erecting flat-arched cast-iron beams over the railway, and throwing brick arches of small span between the beams upon their lower flanges, to cany the roadway. Thus the vertical depth from the soffit or crown of the main arch to the roadway above may but very little exceed the depth of the beam, which is apparent in the sectional view. This method of construction is, moreover, well adapted for skew-bridges. Cast-iron [9:20:234]has, however, as a material for railway structures, been very generally superseded by wrought-iron, forming plate girder bridges. Timber is now almost unheard of for railway bridges on account of its want of durability and stiffness; and such bridges as have formerly been built of timber in Great Britain are being rebuilt of stone, brick, or plate-iron.

. The longest viaduct in England is perhaps the Congleton, on the

The Forth Bridge, designed by Mr John Fowler and Mr Benjamin Baker, is the largest and most remarkable railway bridge in the world. One of its spans is shown in elevation and plan in fig. 20. The bridge consists of 2 spans of 1700 feet each, 2 of 675 each, 15 of 168 each, and 5 of 25 each. Including the width of the piers, there is almost exactly 1 mile of main spans and half a mile of approaches by viaducts, making together about 1| miles of total length. The clear headway under the centre of the bridge is 150 feet above the level of high water, and the highest part of the bridge is 361 above the same level. Each of the three main piers consists of a group of four cylindrical piers of masonry and concrete, 49 feet in diameter at the top and from 60 to 70 in diameter at the bottom. The deepest pier is about 70 feet below low water, and the rise of the tide is 18 feet at ordinary spring tides. In the piers there are about 120,000 cubic yards of masonry and in the superstructure 44,500 tons of steel. The contract was let for the sum of £1,600,000, being at the rate of £645 per lineal yard. An impression of the magnitude of the bridge is derived from a comparison with the largest railway bridge in England, the Britannia Bridge, which has a span of 465 feet, the ratio of which to that of the Forth Bridge—1700 feet—is as 1 to 365־. The site of the Forth Bridge is at Queensferry. At this place the Firth of Forth is divided by the island of Inchgarvie into two channels, which, being as much as 200 feet in depth, precluded the construction of intermediate piers. Hence the adoption of two large spans of 1700 feet each, between which the central pier is founded on the island midway across. The bridge is composed of three double lattice-work cantilevers, like scale-beams, 1360 feet in length, poised on three substructures, and connected at their extremities by ordinary girders 350 feet long, which complete the main spans. The bridge is taper in plan, varying from a width of 120 feet—the distance apart of the lower members of the cantilevers at the piers—to a minimum of 31 £ at the ends, in order to confer a degree of stiffness laterally, for resisting irregular stresses, wind - pressure in particular. The columns above the piers, forming the basis of the cantilevers, are 12 feet in diameter. The lower booms, as well as the struts of the cantilevers, being the members in compression, are circular in cross section, this form of section having been selected as the most effective for resisting compressive stress. The lower boom is at the piers 12 feet in diameter, constructed of plates lj inches in thickness. The size is gradually reduced towards the ends, where the diameter is 5 feet, made of plates three-eighths of an inch in thickness. Correspondingly the upper member of each cantilever is a tapering box-lattice girder, rectangular in section, 12 feet deep by 10 wide at the piers, and 5 feet by 3 at the ends. The central girders are 32 feet apart. The wind-pressure is assumed for calculation at a maximum of 56 lb per superficial foot. It is calculated that the maximum possible stress on any member of the bridge is at the rate of 7 j tons per square inch of section. The required ultimate strength of steel under compression is from 34 to 37 tons per square inch, and under tension from 30 to 33 tons. Between the two main girders the double line of way is to be carried on an

Manchester and Birmingham Railway; it is of stone, 1026 yards or more than half a mile in length and 106 feet high, and it cost £113,000, or £113 per yard run. The Dane viaduct, on the same line, is of brick, 572 yards long and 88 feet high, and it cost £54,000, or £96 per yard run, having 23 arches of 63 feet span. The Avon viaduct, on the Midland Railway, is of brick, 240 yards in length and 51 feet high, with 11 arches of 50 feet span; it cost £14,000, or £60 per yard run. For comparison it maybe stated that the Britannia Tubular Bridge across the Menai Straits, 616 yards long and 104 feet high, cost £600,000, or £974 per yard run. On the different lines entering London there are several miles of brick viaducts in the approaches to termini, and also at Manchester and other large cities and towns. Many interesting details might be given as to bridges and viaducts of the larger kind, but we must here confine ourselves to some account of the Forth Bridge, now in course of construction at Queensferry, referring the reader for other examples to the article Bridges.

internal viaduct (see smaller figure in fig. 20), supported by trestles and cross girders. The way will consist of heavy bridge rails, Brunel section, laid on longitudinal sleepers bedded in four steel troughs, into which the wheels will drop in case of derailment, and then run on the sleepers.

Railway Stations.— Railway stations are either “terminal” or “intermediate.” A terminal station embraces (1) the passenger station; (2) the goods station; (3) the locomotive, carriage, and waggon depots, where the engines and the carrying stock are kept, cleaned, examined, and repaired. At many intermediate stations the same arrangements, on a smaller scale, are made; in all of them there is at least accommodation for the passenger and the goods traffic. The stations for passengers and goods are generally in different and sometimes in distant positions, the place selected for each being that which is most convenient for the traffic. The passenger station abuts on the main line, or, at termini, forms the natural terminus, at a place as near as can conveniently be obtained to the centre of the population which constitutes the passenger traffic. The goods station is approached by a siding or fork set off from the main line at a point short of the passenger station. Terminal branches of the railways—where, for example, there is a sharp incline—are sometimes worked by stationary engines and ropes to the point where the locomotive joins the train. The locomotive station is placed wherever the ground may most conveniently be obtained, at or near to the terminus; in some cases it is found at a distance of 3 or 4 miles. An abundant supply of good water and ample means of drainage are important at stations. There should be ample area of land to admit of the greatest possible extension of accommodation, and the erection of buildings on land adjacent to the station grounds should be discouraged. Companies have been compelled to repurchase at greatly advanced cost land originally disposed of by them as “surplus,” and generally with a view to building operations. When this course is adopted prudent managers should take care to secure in the conveyance power to repurchase the freehold at original prices, with allowance for outlay in building or otherwise, by valuation.

In laying out the approaches and station-yard of passenger, stations ample width and space should be provided, with well-1 defined means of ingress and egress to facilitate the circulation off vehicles, and the setting-down pavement should be as long as possible, to admit of several carriages discharging passengers and luggage at the same time. The pavement should be wide and sheltered from the weather by a roof, overhanging beyond the kerb, or spanning the roadway, but in all cases free from columns. The position of the main buildings relative to the direction of the lines of rails is the distinguishing feature in terminal stations. When space permits, the usual course is to place them on the departure side parallel to the platform, but they are frequently placed at the end of the station at right angles to the rails and platforms. Or these two systems are combined in a third arrangement, in which the offices are placed in a fork, between two or more series of lines and platforms. Of the metropolitan termini, the Great Northern [9:20:235]passenger station, the Great Western, and the South-Western stations are examples of the first class; the London Bridge, Cannon Street, Charing Cross, and Victoria stations (comprising the South-Eastern and the Brighton lines), and the Great Eastern and the Eenchurch Street stations (comprising the North London, Black-wall, North Woolwich, and Tilbury lines), are examples of the second class; and the London and North-Western station is an example of the third class. The first and usual class of stations commands the greatest length of setting-down pavement, ample space for booking and other offices, waiting-rooms, &c., and the shortest average distance for passengers and luggage from the offices to the outgoing trains. Nevertheless, where the traffic is various, involving the despatch of numerous trains to different points in quick succession, and necessarily with perfect regularity, the second system is the best. But where the frontage is limited, and where trains start at some distance from the entrance, there is inconvenience in the movement of luggage over a crowded platform. The third plan is probably the least commodious of the three; but it has the advantage of affording two arrival platforms, with carriage-roads alongside, the others having but one so situated. In all the classes, it may be observed, transverse lines are inserted with turn-tables, to place all the lines in compact communication for turning on or off spare carriages, loaded horse-boxes, or carriage-trucks. Independently of the turn-tables, the lines of rail are connected by switches or points converging towards the two main lines of rail, outgoing and incoming; and thus the assortment and marshalling of trains may be effected by horse or engine power independently of the turn-tables. Each plan of station comprises one or more large turn-tables for reversing the engine with its tender together.

The correct arrangement and appropriation of t*he several lines of railway in a terminal station materially affect the economical and efficient working of the traffic. It is essential that every traffic line, both in and out, should be provided with one or more spare sidings, in addition to those set apart for the break-vans, horse-boxes, and carriage-trucks, and for the locomotive department. All these lines should communicate with each other by means of points and crossings, to allow of shunting with engine-power, and to reduce to the lowest limits the number of turn-tables or their substitutes. Curves ought never to have a radius of less than 800 feet.

The practice with regal’d to the height of platforms above the rails has varied considerably, the tendency being to raise them much higher than was usual at first; 3 feet may be stated aS the limit in this respect. Too much attention cannot be given to the necessity for obtaining the greatest possible width of platform. Where the platform is used on one side only, the width ought never to be less than 20 feet; and when both sides are required 80, or even 40, should be allowed. The best mode of constructing the platform is undoubtedly with stone slabs laid hollow upon longitudinal walls, so as to admit of carrying beneath it the water and gas pipes, telegraph or signal wires, and the general drainage, with free access to each. Cutting out for turn-tables and openings for cross lines of rails are frequently inevitable difficulties, which have given rise to various ingenious contrivances, as shifting-stages, drawbridges, &c. By far the best substitute for the turn-table yet introduced is the traverser. If well made and carefully worked and attended to, the shifting of carriages from line to line can be performed without extra manual labour or interference either with the rails or the platforms. The other objection is best met by the use of easy inclines, with crossings on the rail-level. Where the platforms do not exceed 2 feet in height and the surface is smooth, gradients of 1 in 10 are not too steep for luggage-barrows, nor are they dangerous in a crowd.

The earlier terminal railway stations were designed either with intermediate columns supporting the roof or with brick walls, varying in number of spans from two to five or six. It often happens that in the course of a few years such stations have to be remodelled to meet the constantly increasing traffic; and great difficulties are occasionally met with in the rearrangement of platforms which are wasted where lines of rails have been laid, whilst rails are wasted where platforms are placed, and where columns interfere. To allow engines and carriages to pass from one line of rails to another at the shortest possible intervals it becomes necessary to have diagonal crossings from one pax־t of the station to another in many directions, while at the same time the free movements of passengers and luggage on the platforms must not be impeded. Thus there arose a system, originated, it is believed, in the great Continental termini, of constructing roofs in two spans, one covering the up lines of rails and the other the down lines. King’s Cross passenger station is an example of this kind. The principle of wide spans for the roofs of railway stations, clear of intermediate walls or columns, was adopted in England probably for the first time in 1848-49, in covering Lime Street station, Liverpool, on the London and North-Western Railway, by one span of 1532 feet. The extreme length of the roof was 374 feet. The new Lime Street station, it may be added, is covered by a roof of one span of 212 feet. Tythebarn Street station, Liverpool, on the Lancashire and

Yorkshire Railway, is covered by a roof in one span of 136 feet; there, as the traffic increased, the lines and platforms were changed so as to admit of treble the quantity of traffic being conducted, which would have been impossible if the roof had been built with sectional spans and columns. It is averred that the railway company has been repaid the excessive cost of the single-span roof many times over in economy of working. The next single-span roof on a large scale appears to have been that of 212 feet covering the New Street station, Birmingham, in which five lines of way, belonging to different companies—the London and North-Western and others—meet and concentrate passenger and goods traffic of every description. The roof was 840 feet in length, with trusses or principals placed at intervals of 24 feet. The principal consists of one arched plate-iron girder 15 inches deep, having a rise of 45£ feet at the centre. The ends of the arch are tied by a round tie-bar 4 inches in diameter, from which the arch is strutted at intervals. This is said to cover the largest area of any station in England.

The Cannon Street station of the Charing Cross Railway is the terminus of the City extension of that line, giving direct access to the City of London for the South-Eastern Railway, and linking the Charing Cross station at the west end with the City. During the year 1867—the first year the extension was open for traffic—about 8 million passengers used the Cannon Street station, of which nearly one-half were local passengers booked between Cannon Street and Charing Cross. The length of ground between the river Thames and Cannon Street is 855 feet, of which the fore-court occupies 90, the booking-offices 85, and the shed or covered portion of the station reaching to the river 680. The station is 201 feet 8 inches wide outside the walls and 187 feet inside. The whole of the station is built on a substructure of brick piers and arches, excepting the booking-offices and the part which is over Upper Thames Street. The ordinary piers are 5 feet thick with footings 8 feet wide, resting on a bed of concrete 10 feet in thickness, and the whole of the under structure is made available for storage and other purposes. The rails and platforms are carried across Upper Thames Street on wrought-iron girders 2J feet deep to 37 feet of span. The floor of this bridge is of creasoted Baltic planking 8 inches thick. The walls of the station are of brick-work, 45 feet high above the level of the platform. They are built in piers 6 feet 4J inches thick and panels 2 feet 7\ inches thick. The roof is of one clear span of 190 feet 4J inches circular, having a rise or versed sine of 60 feet at the centre, composed of ribs constructed of plate-iron and angle-iron, and, like ordinary girders, 21 inches deep, each foot of each rib being tied by a tie-bar of round wrought-iron 5TV inches in diameter. The tie-bar rises 30 feet and the depth of the truss at the centre is 30 feet. One end or foot of the rib is fixed to the supporting wall and the other end is placed on rollers, by the aid of which the principal or truss is free to expand or to contract according to the variations of temperature. The trusses are placed at from 33| to 35 feet apart. The booking-offices, waiting-rooms, &c., are at the end of the station on the ground floor of the building, which above and below them forms the City Terminus Hotel. Parcels offices, stores, cellarage, &c., are provided in the basement, with hydraulic lifts worked by direct pressure from tanks in the towers at the south end. The used water is discharged into tanks about 9 feet above the level of the platform, whence it is again utilized for the general purposes of the station. There are nine lines of way in the station, of which eight run alongside five platforms, and one line is space for stock and for standing-room. The two outer platforms are employed for the short traffic to Greenwich and AI id-Kent and to Charing Cross, 13^ feet wide by 522 and 486 feet long respectively. The general departure platform is 665 feet long and 19 wdde; and the two general arrival platforms, one on each side of the cab road, are 721 feet long by 12£ wide. On this system there are two lines of rail to each platform, reckoning the general arrival platforms as one; accommodation is thus found for 4788 lineal feet of trains. These nine lines of way converge and merge in five lines of way over the bridge for a length of about 600 feet, constituting the station-yard. The first line, on the western or up-stream side, is exclusively for trains proceeding from Cannon Street to Charing Cross; the second line is for trains approaching Cannon Street, whether from London Bridge, the country, or Charing Cross; the centre line is exclusively for trains from London Bridge or the country; the fourth is the main down line; the fifth, or east line, is for engines going to or from the engine dépôt at the far end of the bridge, or for engines waiting for their trains. The movements of the trains are regulated from the signal-bridge, which crosses the converged lines of way at a distance of about 140 feet from the south end of the station, by means of about forty pairs of points, with twenty-four semaphore arms, eight of which are for trains outward and sixteen for trains inward. The signal-box on the bridge is 42 feet long and 9 wide, and contains sixty-seven levers, by thirty-seven of which signals on Saxby and Farmer’s system are worked, and by thirty the points are worked. Several of the point-levers work the switches at both ends of cross-over lines. The signals lock the points and each other, so that no contradictory signals can be [9:20:236]given; nor can ingress to or egress from a platform be given until the points are set accordingly. There are in the locking frame thirty-two slides and about a thousand locks, and an idea of the duty that falls on this apparatus may be formed from the fact that 775 trains have passed under the signal-bridge in a single working day (Whit-Monday), and that, each train being reversed here, a fresh engine has to be attached to it, the superseded engine being passed into a siding. In the course of thirty-five minutes one morning thirty-five trains were signalled and passed in or out of the station. The duty of signalling is performed by tw τ o men.

The cost of the works of the Cannon Street station, with the cost for Charing Cross station for comparison, is shown in Table XXV. (below). The substructure is reckoned to the formation-level, inclusive of the public footway under Charing Cross station and the public roadway under Cannon Street station, but exclusive of the river abutment of the bridge. The superstructure includes the fore-court, booking-offices, fittings, towers, roof, gas and water mains, &c., excluding the permanent way.
[table]

The total cost of the works of the whole Charing Cross Railway, from London Bridge station to Cannon Street and Charing Cross, with the terminal stations, was £1,160,118. The cost of the land for the whole railway, after deducting the value of surplus land, Hungerford Bridge, pier tolls, &c., was £1,900,000, making a total for land and works of over £3,000,000. For this sum there are 4⅜ miles of railway for double line, the cost being at the rate of £680,000 per mile. The works include two large bridges over the river Thames, a number of expensive bridges over streets, viaducts, and two large metropolitan termini. The cost for land at Cannon Street station was at the rate of £3,15s. 7d. per square foot, and that at Charing Cross station was £2, 18s. 5d.

St Pancras passenger station of the Midland Railway is the most recently constructed metropolitan terminus. The approach to the land on which the station is built was crossed by the Regent’s Canal, and in order to secure good gradients and suitable levels for metropolitan suburban stations the main passenger line is earned over the canal; and, as a result, the level of St Pancras station is from 12 to 17 feet higher than that of the adjoining roads. The St Pancras branch, on the contrary, for effecting a junction with the Metropolitan Railway, leaving the main line some distance from the terminus, descends through a tunnel beneath the Regent’s Canal and the passenger station, as well as under a considerable length of the main line. The height of the rails above the ground-level admitted of the construction of a lower floor with direct access to the streets, built and arranged for Burton beer traffic. The floor of the station is supported on girders and columns extending from side to side and acting as a tie for the roof girders, which start from the ground-level and form the roof as a single arch. The ribs or girders forming the roof are laid to a clear span of 240 feet; the walls built between the ribs are 245½ feet apart. The clear height of the ribs above the level of the platforms is 96 feet at the centre. The length of the station is 689 feet 4 inches. The lower floor contains 720 cast-iron columns set on brick piers, and 49 rows of principal girders across the station, with 15 rows longitudinally. Upon these intermediate girders are carried, and the whole is covered in with Mallett’s buckled plates. The cost of the ironwork of the floor was £57,000, being at the rate of £3, 0s. 6d. per square yard. The roof girders, twenty-five in number, are placed at intervals of 29 feet 4 inches, except at the outer end, where the last two girders are only 14 feet 8 inches apart. The cost of the roof, including covering, with two gables and screens, amounted to £69,365, being at the rate of £40, 18s. per square of 100 square feet or 10 feet square. If there had not been any floor-girders to act as roof-ties, the extra cost for ties at the level of the floor would have been about £1 per square.

Table XXVI. gives the spans and areas covered by the roofs of some of the principal London passenger termini :—

The goods and mineral station at King’s Cross may be selected as an example of such stations. It comprises coal dépôts and wharves, potato-stores, engine-sheds, repairing sheds, stores, stables, and all the necessary offices, buildings, and appliances required for the goods and mineral traffic of the company. Twelve lines of rail run into the goods-shed, with a platform at each side for the receipt and despatch of goods. On the outer side of the rails, within the building, space is reserved for the vans engaged in collecting and distributing the goods. The outer line of rails at the east side of the platform is used for unloading the -waggons with the inward goods, and that on the west side for loading the outward goods. The inner lines nearest to these are used for the arrival of goods trains, for empty waggons, and for making up trains for departure. The waggons, after being unloaded, are taken by means of turntables and cross-roads to the departure side of the station, where the business of loading and despatching them is carried on. The platforms have each two rows of hydraulic cranes, of 1 and 2 tons lifting power alternately. The receiving offices are on the platforms, but the general offices are adjacent to the main building. The stables are under the platform; the granary is at the south end of the goods-shed, through which it is approached by two lines running through the middle of the shed,—two other lines, one on each side of them, being reserved for full waggons. When emptied, the waggons are removed by two lines which run one on each outer side of the goods-shed. The shed and the granary are supplied with water communication through tunnels under the roads to a basin on the south, and thence to the Regent’s Canal; and lighters can receive or discharge their freights directly under the buildings. On the west of the goods-shed are the coal dépôts and staiths. The coal arriving at the station is discharged in some cases directly from the waggons into carts alongside; in other cases it is discharged through hoppers on to weighing machines at a lower level, and thence filled into sacks. For this operation there is a frontage of 343 yards; and there is in addition a coal dépôt in Cambridge Street, adjoining the goods-yard, with a frontage of 196 yards. There is a coal and stone dock or basin connected with the Regent’s Canal, where barges are loaded directly from the coal - waggons, either through doorways in the bottom of the waggons or by discharging the coal from the sides of the waggons into hoppers. There is also a hopper at the Cambridge Street dépôt for the purpose of loading barges on the canal. Adjoining the canal basin there are numerous private wharves for bricks and other merchandise. To the north are the locomotive and carriage sheds for repairing the stock, also two engine-running sheds, one round and the other rectangular. The goods, mineral, and locomotive stations cover an area of about 70 acres, and the total area covered by the goods and passenger stations and the running lines to Copenhagen tunnel is upwards of 90 acres. The principal goods-shed and granary is 300 feet long and 175 wide, and the area occupied by the goods-warehouses, potato-market, coal-offices, and other buildings amounts to 8¾ acres. In addition, 1 acre is covered by open sheds and 1⅜ acres by the stables and the engineers’ shops. The engine-sheds can hold eighty-four engines and tenders, and they, with the workshops, tanks, carriage-repairing shops, and sundry premises, cover 2½ acres. ^[5.] There are in the goods, mineral, and engine yards 28½ miles of single line of way and more than 250 sets of switches, 200 turn-tables for waggons, and one for engines and tenders; of that length of line 11⅜ miles of sidings are used for coal-waggons.

It is unnecessary to dwell at length on the arrangement of small terminal stations for branch lines. Where the line is single a single platform suffices, the trains being light and moving only in one direction at one time.

In fixing intermediate stations the first step should be to get a good map of all the places -within the scope of the railway, and to mark upon it the population of each place from the last parliamentary census. The greater the number of stations, the more the travelling increases; for quick and cheap transit creates traffic. Stations, especially important ones, should be on the surface rather than on an embankment or a viaduct or in a cutting. Facilities of access in all directions from the surrounding districts, with good roads in the case of passenger traffic, and good water and railway communication for goods dépôts, are obviously indispensable. For safety and regularity there should be an uninterrupted view along the line of railway—no sharp curves or complication of over-bridges —in the vicinity of a large station. Intermediate and junction stations should be situated on dead levels, since, when a good length of level can be had, with gradients falling from it both ways, there is the greatest possible facility for working the traffic. Falling gradients towards a station are objectionable, but cannot in all cases be avoided. When the station is situated midway between towns of such extent as to cause an equal flow of traffic in each direction, offices may be requisite on both sides of the line; but, where the bulk of the traffic tends one way only, it will be desirable to concentrate it on that side which involves the larger number of passengers and the greater extent of waiting space.
[9:20:237]

This rule, again, will be modified by the position of the town or the district whence the traffic is to be derived, especially if the railway lies on the natural surface and adjoins a public road, whether crossing on the level or otherwise. This last condition is the most frequent one; and, as some portion at least of the traffic must be expected to depart from the platform opposite to the offices, provision must be made for crossing with the least amount of danger to the public. When the passengers are numerous in both directions, over-bridges, as before stated, are objectionable; and in a surface-station an archway under the line is frequently impracticable. Some good authorities have adopted the plan of making the trains take up and set down the passengers at one platform only, when the platform may be made rather more than double the length of a single train, having crossings in the centre to communicate with both lines of rails, thus placing the trains when standing on the platform upon a loop-siding distinct from those lines. This system offers great convenience to the public when there is much first-class traffic and a large quantity of baggage; and it is especially applicable when the station partakes of the character of a terminus, or is used as a receiver from branch or neighbouring lines, offering, as it does, great facilities for making up and receiving trains which may run over a portion only of the main lines, as well as for attaching and detaching the carriages intended or used for branch traffic, i The buildings and yards in junction stations may be placed in the fork between the two double lines of railway forming the junction, or beyond the point of junction.

Locomotive stations comprise two departments,—the running: and the constructing and repairing of engines and tenders. The chief locomotive station of the Midland Railway at Derby may be taken as an example. It is contiguous to the passenger station, and is in communication with the main line by a number of sidings branching off at the north end of that station, near the bridge over the Derby Canal. The area of ground enclosed is about 80 acres, of which 12 are covered by buildings. The walls of the erecting shops are 284 feet high; those of the fitting and other shops are 20. The tools are 693 in number. The number of locomotives housed at Derby station (1885) is 289. There is room in the erecting shops for seventy-one locomotives. The workshops are capable of turning out 120 engines per year—say, thirty new engines with tenders, and ninety engines with new boilers, cylinders, and other working parts.

The carriage and waggon works of the Midland Railway at Derby are situated about half a mile south of the passenger station, with which they are connected by a double line of way branching out from the south end of the station. The works were built in 1875-76, on an enclosed piece of land 67 acres in extent, of which 19| are covered by buildings. There are 15J miles of single way within the enclosure. The workshops are built in blocks, separated by open spaces of at least 70 feet in width. They consist principally of seven large shops, of red brick, the walls being of a uniform height of 21 feet; four on the west side are devoted to the preparation of timber and the building and painting of carriages and waggons, and three on the east side to the manipulation of various metals, comprising the foundry and iron stores, the smithy and the machine and fitting shop. Each block of building is entirely surrounded by a 7-inch water-main continually charged with water at a pressure sufficient to throw a jet over the ridge of the roof of any of these buildings. Vehicular communication is carried on between the shops on the east and the west side of the works by means of traversing tables, the rails for which are laid the entire distance across the shops from north to south, and intersect the nine principal lines of sidings flanking the shops. Both steam-power and horse-power are used for moving the traversers.

The saw-mill is 320 feet long and 200 wide. In the cellar underneath all the main shafting, pulleys, and belting are placed. About a hundred loads of oak logs are converted into plank or scantling weekly. There are in all about a hundred machines for sawing and working wood. Outside the saw-mill are large crosscutting saw-benches, with circular saws 6 feet in diameter, by which logs of deal are cut to the required length before being taken into the mill. The waggon-shop is 320 feet long and 200 wide. The carriage building and finishing shop is 384 by 200 feet wide. In the panel-shed fitted with louvre ventilators, mahogany panel boards, maple boards, &c., are stored for about two years, to be thoroughly dried and seasoned before being used in vehicles. The painting and trimming shop is 384 by 300 feet. It has seventeen lines of rails, each capable of holding ten ordinary vehicles. From the commencement to the finish, twenty-five distinct operations— pruning, filling up, rubbing down, painting, varnishing—are performed on a passenger carriage. Young girls and women—the children and widows of the company’s servants who have lost their lives by accident in the service—are employed on the light work of sewing, stuffing of cushions and backs of carriages, french-polishing, washing and dyeing, cleaning and lacquering light brass-work and gilding.

The foundries, iron and brass, are 200 feet long by 90 wide. Two thousand tons of iron castings are turned out annually. There are the bar-iron stores 200 by 45 feet, the general stores 150 by 90 feet, and the mess-room 45 by 70 feet, providing accommodation for 500 workmen; also two smiths’ shops, one of them 22 6 by 200 feet, the other 140 by 200 feet; the machine and fitting shop, 400 by 225 feet; and the coal-waggon repairing shop, 350 by 300 feet. The carriage and waggon works just noticed are capable of turning out seven new carriages and eighty new waggons weekly. All the building of railway carriages for the Midland Railway is done at their works, and 80 per cent, of the new waggons are built here. Eighty per cent, of the carriages and 20 per cent, of the waggons are repaired here. The machinery of all kinds laid down for carrying on the business of the carriage and waggon works comprises 500 machine tools, 9 steam-engines, 1 gas-engine, 15 stationary boilers, 4 warming boilers, 3 steam traversers, 2 steam cranes, 2 steam travelling cranes, with a number of hydraulic cranes and overhead cranes.

One of the engine houses or sheds for engines on duty, at Gorton station, on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire railway, is shown in fig. 21. It is a rotunda of 150 feet in diameter inside, and is capable of holding seventeen engines with their tenders, leaving the entrance and exit lines clear. The advantage of this arrangement over the ordinary polygonal engine-house is in the absence of pillars for supporting the roof, of which there are twelve for a twelve-sided polygon; in this building there is but one column, at the centre. To the left of the entrance is a furnace for holding live fuel, from which the engines are lighted; and there are two lines of rail across the central turn-table, on one of which the engines enter and on the other depart. Between the rails of each radiating line a pit is constructed to afford access below the engines for inspection. The roof is of wrought-iron, surmounted by a louvre for ventilation, which is glazed to admit light freely. In the engine-shed of the North-Eastern Railway at Newcastle five ordinary engine-house rotundas have been replaced by a single rectangular building 450 by 280 feet with five turn-tables. This shed has berths for ninety engines, and the extra space enclosed by the rectangular building as against separate rotundas is used for executing minor repairs.

Station Fittings .—The use of switches and crossings is to form a Jink of communication between one line of rails and another. They are either constructed with ordinary rails or with rails specially rolled, and are carried in cast-iron chairs spiked down to sleepers. The switch-rails are movable, and when worked independently are moved by rods to which heavy weights are attached, —the function of the weights being to retain the points in one position, and to act as a self-acting adjustment in restoring them to their normal position after they have been shifted for the passage of a vehicle or a train. "When only one of the terminal rails is movable it is called a single switch and is used only on sidings or branch lines of rail. The double switches, being more perfect in [9:20:238]action, are adopted on the main line; and, as a general rule, switches on the main line are ordered to be laid with the points in the direction of the traffic, so that passing trains may run out of the points, and not into them. “Facing-points,” as they are termed, are such as are laid on the main line, facing or pointing towards the regular advancing trains. Many accidents have been caused to trains by facing-points, improperly set or out of order, turning the train unexpectedly into a siding, when it was impossible to pull up in time to prevent a collision, or throwing the train off the rails altogether. So dangerous are facing-points felt to be, particularly on high-speed lines, that on some railways they are absolutely forbidden at all except at terminal stations and at intermediate stations where every train is ordered to stop. In some situations this rule can only be followed by sacrificing simplicity and increasing the number of backing-points; but it no doubt diminishes the risk of accident.

Turn-tables are of two classes,—for turning carriages and waggons, and for turning engines and tenders together. Those ordinarily used are of cast-iron, and carry two transverse lines of rails. They revolve upon a central pivot and conical rollers near the circumference, which are upheld by and turn upon a cast - iron base bedded in cement, or on a. built foundation (see fig. 22). For turning engines and tenders together turntables about 40 feet long are required. A common plan of table consists of two longitudinal balks of timber, to carry a line of rails, framed together with cast - iron beams in such aJ way that the centre is supported on a pivot and the extremities on rollers. The table revolves, in a pit about 4 feet deep, on a large circular race of cast-iron bedded on a firm foundation to carry the rollers, and the motive force is applied by means of gearing. In situations where there is much traffic it is needful to extend the deck of the table laterally, like wings, to complete the circle, and so cover in the pit.

Traversers are a convenient substitute for turn-tables, particularly for working a number of parallel lines of rails. A traverser is simply a low rectangular frame, made with two overhanging rails, to receive carriages or waggons, and movable on rollers across the lines of rail, so as to receive the carriage from any one line of rail and deposit it on any other.

Water-cranes for delivering water to locomotives are too familiar to every one to need description.

Railway Signals .—The earliest passenger railways were opened without any fixed signals. Flags and disks, elevated on posts and pillars, were first employed, in various forms, and were worked on various codes. Sir Charles Hutton Gregory, about the year 1841, designed and erected at New Cross station, on the Croydon Railway, the semaphore signal, an adaptation of the old form of semaphore used for telegraphing over short distances. This was the most important step ever taken in the development of railway signalling. The semaphore has been almost universally adopted for fixed signalling on railways. There are two arms, to the right and to the left, to command trains arriving in either direction. The arm is turned out horizontally, in a position perpendicular to the post, to signal danger; diagonally downwards at an angle of about 45’ as a signal of caution; and it is turned home, disappearing within the post, when the line is right for the approach of a train. But the general practice now (1885) is to work the semaphore in two positions only,—at danger and at caution. It is thus always in sight, and its position can be identified without hesitation. To make the signal system safe there must be clear definition and strict enforcement of the duties of the attendant; good men must be selected at adequate pay, and they must have convenient, warm, well-fitted lodges, with ample window-space, within which they may keep a constant watch over the line without exposure to weather. At junctions and other important signal-stations the lodges should be raised some height above the surface, to give perfect supervision in every direction and prevent distraction. At night the place of semaphores or disks is supplied by large and powerful lamps with reflectors, capable of showing lights of three colours,—a white light, a blue or green light, and a red light, signifying respectively safety, caution, danger; or, as in general practice, two lights only are shown,—red and green.

Signalling has been a subject of much controversy, and has been divided into two main systems. In “negative” signalling the normal position is that of caution, or that of safety, as the practice may be, and the signal is only turned on to danger when specially required for the protection of the station on the line. On the other hand, the “positive” system presupposes the normal state of the signal to be that of danger, so that, if the signalman neglect his duty to lower the semaphore when the station is clear for the passage of an approaching train, the train is bound to stop. The positive system has long been in successful operation at all large and important junctions., In such a situation the use of a stringent code is manifestly conducive to the greatest degree of safety, as by the unavoidable intersections of the lines of rails there are many chances of collision. The positive system has been merged in what is known as the block system of signalling,—that is to say,! the positive system has been on most railways extended to every s station on the lines in combination with telegraphic signalling. The best, perhaps the only, safeguard against error on the part of the persons in charge of trains is to be found in the adoption of the absolute block system, and of means for enabling engine-drivers to observe signals well in advance. The absolute block system consists in dividing the line of railway into intervals of convenient lengths, and by means of telegraphic and fixed signals allowing only one train at a time on any single length of single way. The signalman at station A does not send a second train to station B until he receives a signal from station B that the first train has arrived there; meantime the signal at A stands at danger until the man at B signals the arrival of the train at B. Under the “permissive block” system it is simply permitted to signalman B to block signalman A in the event of anything occurring at station B that may render that course advisable. But, supposing that a train has just left station A, then the message from B comes too late to enable signalman A to prevent the train from running into the obstruction at B. The permissive system has been well tried on the principal railways, and is preferred on some lines because it admits of trains being passed on one after another with greater rapidity than on the absolute block system. But it does not afford much protection, and it is now generally preferred to work on the absolute block system, and, for the purpose of doing so effectually, to erect intermediate stations on lines of constant traffic, so as to provide shorter intervals for blockings and obviate the delay incidental to unduly long intervals. The average distance apart of passenger stations is, say, 3 miles, but the distance of signal-stations, whilst it seldom exceeds 4 miles, is frequently only a quarter of a mile, and the average interval may be taken as 1^ miles. Distant signals—that is, signals placed at a distance in advance of points of danger and worked by wire communication from the signal-box—were, it is believed, first introduced on the North British Railway at Meadowbank station near Edinburgh in 1846, after the opening of the Hawick branch. In 1852 the Great Northern Railway was completely fitted with distant signals of the semaphore type. Distant signals are occasionally fixed at 1500 yards’ distance; but beyond 800 yards their action is uncertain, and it is checked by a repeater—electric or mechanical—by which, by way of confirmation, the signal is returned to the signalman.

As railway junctions were multiplied it became apparent, not only that distant signals were to be provided for distinct lines, but that concerted action should be established between signals and switches. They are said to be connected when they are simply coupled together and are moved simultaneously. They are said to be interlocked when the necessary movement of the switches is' completed before that of the signal to safety is commenced; and,! conversely, the movement of the signal to danger is completed before the movement of the switches can be commenced. This is the fundamental principle of the interlocking system of signalling now generally practised. By the combination of the absolute block system and the interlocking system the greatest possible number of trains are enabled to travel over one pair of rails in a given time. At Cannon Street station, at the busiest time of the day, eighteen trains arrive and eighteen depart within an hour; 108 operations of shifting switches and signals, by means of sixty-seven levers or handles, have to be performed in that time. On the North London Railway, at Liverpool Street station, 250 trains pass over the same rails in a day of nineteen hours, averaging only four minutes between trains; frequently only two minutes elapse. The number of trains daily using Moorgate Street station on the Metropolitan Railway is more than 770, involving twice as many movements of engines—1540 movements—on four lines of way in nineteen hours, and every movement is separately signalled. This, of course, could not be performed without the aid of electric mstru[9:20:239]ments, to enable the signalmen to communicate with each other, and to have a constant record on the faces of the instruments to show what is being done.

Metropolitan Railways.

Railways designed for the local service of large cities are necessarily either sunk below or raised above the level of the streets. The late Mr Charles Pearson, solicitor to the City of London, was the originator of the system of intra-metropolitan railways. He worked at the subject from the year 1837. The Metropolitan and the Metropolitan District Railways in and around London are examples of the underground system. In 1854 the first Act of Parliament was passed; the works were commenced in 1860; the first section of the line—Paddington to Farringdon Street—was opened in January 1863, Mr John Fowler being the engineer. Several consecutive extensions into the City and towards Westminster and the Mansion House were made at different times, until the “inner circle” was completed in October 1884, thirty years after the passing of the first Act, and twenty-four years after the commencement of the work of construction. The inner circle of railways as constructed is the direct outcome of the recommendation of the Lords’ Committee of 1863, that they should abut upon, if they did not actually join, nearly all the principal railway termini in the metropolis, completing the circle by a line on the north side of the Thames. The total length of the inner circle is 13 miles and 176 yards. About 2 miles of this length are laid with four lines of rails, and there are twenty-seven stations on the circle at an average distance of half a mile apart. The combined length of the two systems, including the extensions beyond the inner circle, amounted in December 1883 to 40 miles.

The cost of the Metropolitan Railway system, 22 miles in length, in December 1883 has already been stated as £500,000 per mile, and that of the Metropolitan District Railway system, 18 miles in length, as £374,000 per mile. In 1871, when the works had been completed and opened from Moorgate Street to Mansion House station, the capital expenditure by the District Railway Company for works and equipment of 7 j miles of double-line railway was officially stated to be £5,147,000; and by the Metropolitan Railway Company £5,856,000 on lOj miles, —subject to deduction in respect of surplus lands. The combined cost for 17¿ miles was at the rate of £630,000 per mile—the greater cost per mile being, no doubt, due to the gi’eater proportion of underground work. The cost of the 1^ miles recently opened between]Mansion House and Aldgate stations was about £450,000, or about £400,000 per mile. The longer axis of the inner circle is about 5^ miles in length, east and west, and the shorter about 2 miles long at the widest part, north and south. The line runs at very various levels, traversing the sloping ground that stretches from the river Thames towards the heights of Hampstead and Highgate. Several natural sewers, formerly clear brooks or tidal channels, now covered, are traversed by the railway. They occasioned many difficulties and great outlay, as they required to be conveyed across the line in specially constructed conduits. The Ranelagh sewer, for instance, is carried under the Metropolitan Railway at Gloucester Terrace in a brick-built channel 9 feet wide by 8 high; and over the District Railway at Sloane Square station in a cast-iron tube 9 feet in diameter, supported on wrought-iron girders of 70 feet span. The Fleet Ditch had to be crossed five times. The average level of the rails of the District Railway, which traverses the old bed of the river and the swamps of Pimlico and Bridge Creek, is 13 feet below Thames high-water mark; whilst that of the northern part, on the Metropolitan Railway, is 60 feet above that datum, making 73 feet of difference of level, and giving rise to heavy works and steep gradients at the west and east ends of the circle. Cuttings 42 feet deep and a tunnel 421 yards in length are found at Campden Hill on the west; and cuttings 33 feet deep and a tunnel 728 yards in length at Clerken-well on the east, on gradients of 1 in 75 and 1 in 100 respectively.

The works of construction consist of covered ways, tunnels, and open cuttings with retaining v׳alls. The cost of property precluded the use of ordinary open cuttings with slopes. The covered ways were formed by making open cuttings in the first place and then building “open” or artificial tunnels, and covering them in, so as to restore the surface. The sides of the cuttings were made vertical or nearly vertical, and they were supported by timber framing or poling boards till the masonry of the tunnel was completed. The line from Paddington to Moorgate was made in this way with a mixed gauge—that is, the 7 feet gauge and the 4 feet 8i inch gauge in combination—to take the traffic of the Great Western Railway as well as that of national gauge lines. The covered way was therefore made 28J feet wide and 17 high for the mixed gauge, and the arch is elliptical, built of seven “rings” or courses of brick, with side walls three bricks or 27 inches thick, on footings 4 feet wide. At the junction of a branch with the main line a “bell-mouth” or expanding arch was constructed in which the span was gradually enlarged to 60 feet. The covered way on the extension, where the national gauge alone was laid, was 25 feet wide. The normal or standard type of arched covered way is 15 feet 9 inches high above the level of the rails. The side walls are three bricks or 27 inches in thickness, and the backs of the walls are carried down vertically to the foundation. The arch was ordinarily built with five rings of bricks, making 22£ inches of thickness; but the number of rings was increased occasionally to eight, nine, or ten rings. The haunches of the arch are backed with concrete. The footings of the walls rest on concrete foundations 30 inches in thickness. A drain-pipe 18 inches in diameter is laid longitudinally along the middle of the tunnel. The whole of the tunnelling of the District Railway, of which Mr Fowler was the engineer, was put in with open cuttings. Two trenches 6 feet wide were sunk to receive the side walls, which were built up to a level 4 feet above the springing of the arch. As the construction of the walls proceeded the timbering was removed and replaced by concrete backing behind the walls. The earth in the middle, called the “dumpling” or core, was excavated to such a level as to admit of the centering being put into position for the turning of the arch. When the arch was built and the centering removed, the dumpling, which had been utilized for transport, was excavated down to the floor-level from the ends, whence the stuff was conveyed away. By this economical method of procedure the only earth and gravel that required to be lifted was that which was excavated in forming the trenches for the side walls. It was raised by means of steam-cranes travelling on temporary rails laid by the sides of the excavations. Again, the centering for the arch was supported on the core, and was simple and less costly than ordinary centering. The complete arch is shown in section in fig. 23. Inverts, or inverted arches, were laid in across the bottom, between the footings of the walls, where, from the nature of the soil or from excessive lateral pressure, the floor was thought likely to rise. W hen there was not sufficient depth for a brick arched way the side walls were made, as shown in fig. 24, of brick and concrete, in bays 8 feet wide, of piers and recesses, spanned by cast-iron girders from 18 to 30 inches in depth, carrying jack-arches between them. The average cost of the arcli-covered ways, 25 feet wide, was about £40 per lineal yard, as against £52 per yard for the girder-covered way.

On the inner circle there are three tunnels,—the Clerkenwell I tunnel, 728 yards long, of which the level of the rails was from c 29 to 59 feet" below the surface of the ground; the “widening” tunnel, 733 yards long, parallel to the Clerkenwell tunnel; and the tunnel under Campden Hill, 421 yards in length. Even when the utmost precautions are taken, tunnelling through a town is a risky operation. Settlements may occur years after the completion of the works; water mains may be broken in the streets and in the houses; stone staircases may fall down; and other unpleasant symptoms of instability may show themselves. The cost of the tunnel of 25 feet in width was at the rate of £63 per lineal yard.

Open cuttings are 28^ feet in clear width on the original line of mixed gauge and 25 feet wide on the extensions. The retaining walls are of brick and concrete, in 11 feet bays, consisting of piers 3 feet wide on the face, and recesses between the piers 8 feet wide. They are inclined backwards with a batter of l| inches to 1 foot. The foundations are 5 feet below the level of the rails, and the thickness of the walls at the base is 40 per cent., or two-fifths of the height. Occasionally, where the depth is considerable, the thickness is less, and one or two rows of [9:20:240]cast-iron struts, according to the depth, are placed between the walls at the upper part to take the thrust. A section of open cutting with two rows of struts is shown in fig. 25. The cost of open cuttings 25 feet wide and 25 deep was, say, £67 per lineal yard, or with one row of cast-iron struts £55 per yard. With two rows of struts for a depth of 42 feet, the cost was £108 per lineal yard. It was the intention originally to make the stations as well as the railway strictly “underground,” and those at Baker Street, Portland Road, and Gower Street were so constructed. At Baker Street a segmental arch of 45 feet span and 10 feet 4 inches of rise extends over the entire length of 300 feet of platform. The cost of such a station, including booking-offices, restorations, and other contingencies, amounted to £18,000. Ou the extensions the stations were, when the conditions admitted it, placed in open cuttings, roofed over, 300 feet long, with platforms 15 feet wide. The average cost exceeded that of the same length of ordinary covered way by from £14,000 to £22,000. Not only sewers but gas mains and water mains occasionally demanded very expensive diversions. In passing Broad Sanctuary 2000 feet of gas mains, ranging from 14 to 30 inches in diameter, were diverted; and in simply crossing High Street, Kensington, 600 feet of pipes of from 3 to 30 inches bore were diverted. In passing a sound building on a good foundation the work was executed in short lengths, with carefully timbered trenches quickly followed up by the concrete and brickwork of the retaining walls or covered way. Under the houses of Pembridge Square the side walls of the railway were constructed in short lengths, and to form the roof of the covered way main girders of 25 feet span were slipped between the walls of the houses at convenient places, between which jack-arches were built. At Park Crescent only a floor of old ship timber separates the kitchens from the railway. The permanent way originally consisted of wrought-iron flange rails with longitudinal sleepers and then of steel flange rails; but these have been gradually replaced by double-headed rails in chairs. Fig. 26 shows a section of the covered way under Queen Victoria Street, with the main sewer underneath and the galleries for pipes, &c., at the sides.

The Glasgow City and District Railway will supply important links of communication between the railways on the north side of the river Clyde. The line extends from College station, High Street, by George Street and Regent Street, crossing Dumbarton Road to the existing Stobcross line, over a length of nearly 2£ miles, almost wholly underground. Of this length 1700 yards, or nearly 1 mile, are tunnelled and 1000 yards are covered way. The tunnels are arched with four rings of biick in cement, to a clear height of 18.} feet at the crown and 27 feet in width, for two lines of way. The covered way is arched over with brick.

We may take the “elevated railroads” of New York as an instance of metropolitan railways for local service above ground. In 1867 the first attempt was made to improve existing means of transit between the residential and the business quarters of the city by the construction of an elevated railroad worked by a wire rope and a stationary engine. The railroad passed into other hands in 1872, and the New York Elevated Railroad Company w r as formed. The lines of this and of the Metropolitan Elevated Railroad Company are now worked together by the Manhattan Railway Company. From the southern terminus of the former railway at South Ferry diverge the lines by which the eastern and western sides of the city are • traversed. Junctions are made with the Grand Central Dépôt of the New York Central and other railroads, and with the New York City and Northern Railroad. In the beginning of 1880 the elevated system was worked over 34£ miles of line; in 1884 96,702,620 passengers were carried over the system, averaging 265,000 per day, over half on one line (3d Ave.). Trains run every two minutes in the morning and evening, when the fares are 5 cents or 2£d. for any distance; and in the quieter hours of the day every four or five minutes for a general fare of 10 cents or 5d. The working charges amounted in 1883-84 to 58 per cent, of the gross earnings. On the New York Elevated Railroad the line is supported on square wrought-iron lattice-work columns let into cast-iron base blocks founded on brickwork and concrete, at distances of from 37 to 44 feet apart. Where the street traffic is crowded a single row of columns is planted in the line of each curb, on the upper ends of which a pair of longitudinal girders are fixed to carry a line of way, 22£ feet high above the street level, as shown in fig. 27, at each side of the street. In other situations the two lines of way are supported at a height of 21 feet on longitudinal girders in the middle of the street, fixed to transverse girders, which span the street and are carried on columns at the curbs. A third arrangement is adopted where the columns are planted in the street at a distance transversely of 23| feet, as in fig. 28, each carrying a line of rails at a height of 18 feet, and connected at intervals by arched bracing to steady the structure. In this illustration the street is occupied by a double line of tramway. The rails are of the Vignoles pattern, of Bessemer steel, weighing 50 lb per yard, spiked to cross timber sleepers, and guarded by two longitudinal timbers, one on each side of each rail. The sharpest curve on the main line has 90 feet of radius. The gradients conform, for the most part, to those of the streets, and the steepest gradient is 1 in 50 for a length of 800 yards. The traffic is worked with outside cylinder, four-coupled wheel, bogie-truck locomotives, weighing in working order 19^ tons. The driving-wheels are 3^ feet in diameter, and the cylinders 12 inches in diameter with a stroke of 16 inches. The cars are of the usual American type, entered from each end, 45 feet long and 8 wide, with seats for forty-two passengers. They are placed on two bogie trucks, and weigh 12 tons. The trains are provided with continuous air-brakes. The stations are about one-third of a mile apart; the platforms are 200 feet long and 13 wide. The cost per mile of double way is given by Mr R. E. Johnston as follows:—

Foundations, columns, girders, superstructure, and permanent way .. £57,696

Stations............................................................ 12,000

Five locomotives................................................... 4,000

Tw'elve cars....................................................... 7,660

Total per mile..........................................£81,376

No payment has been made for way-leave along the streets, nor for compensation to frontagers, though it is known that in the residential quarters traversed by the railroads rents have in many instances, at least, been depreciated to the extent of 50 per cent.

Permanent Wat.

The permanent way consists of rails, chairs, spikes, keys, and sleepers laid in a bed of ballast deposited on the formation. The sleepers of substructure should be bedded on broken stones, cinders, or gravel, at least 12 inches in depth under the sleepers, without [9:20:241]any clay or other material in it that might interfere with the drainage of water through the ballast to the formation.

Gauge.— The measure of the standard or British national gauge of railways is 4 feet 8⅛ inches of width between the rails forming a line of rails or a way. There are many other gauges in existence in different parts of the world. In England the gauge of 7 feet, originally adopted on the Great Western Railway, was known as the “broad gauge” in contradistinction to the ordinary gauge of 4 feet 8⅜ inches, which was for a long time known as the “narrow gauge.” But the 7 feet gauge has been to a great extent replaced by the 4 feet 8⅜ inch or national gauge, and it is being gradually replaced altogether. The lengths of line now (1885) laid on the two gauges on the Great Western Railway are as follows :—
[table]

The name of ‘ , narrow gauge” has now ceased to be applicable to the standard gauge, and is reserved for gauges of much less width,— the metre gauge and others of from 2 to 3 or 3⅜ feet wide. Why a fractional measure of gauge should have been selected is a question which has puzzled many people. The fact seems to be that the track of the original carts or trains—5 feet wide outside the wheels— was taken as a standard for the gauge of rails, which was measured outside also. The width of the single rail at the top being originally 1 j inches, the width for the two rails together is 3⅜ inches, which leaves 4 feet 8⅜ inches for the inside measure or true gauge. There are in the United Kingdom a few railways of gauge narrower than the standard gauge, of which instances occur in the following lines :—Festiniog, 1 foot 11⅛ inches; Talyllyn, 2 feet 6 inches; Dinas and Snowdon, Southwold, Isle of Man, Manx Northern, Ravenglass and Eskdale, Ballymena and Larne, each 3 feet. The following statement (Table XXVII.) comprises the gauges of the principal railway systems in the world :—
[table]

∕

The relative advantages of broad gauges and narrow gauges were exhaustively discussed at the Institution of Civil Engineers (in 1873), on the reading of Mr W. T. Thornton’s paper on “The Relative Advantages of the 5 feet 6 inch Gauge and of the Metre Gauge for the State Railways of India.” The fallacy pervading the arguments for narrow gauges is that they take the width between the rails as the basic unit of the system; whereas that is really little more than an incident, and the dimensions of the railway must in point of fact be governed by the size and weight of the vehicles which the traffic requires. Speaking generally, the national gauge of 4 feet 8.) inches is at least as good as any other for the purposes of general traffic. If the width of gauge were still an open question, it might be maintained that a gauge of 5 feet would be rather more convenient in view of the increasing size of the more powerful locomotives.

Rails.— “The experience of the last twenty-five years,” said Mr George Parker Bidder, speaking in 1861, “has shown that one system has been adopted almost universally—the double-headed rails, upon chairs with cross sleepers, a plan which has been materially improved by fishing the joints.” On the continent of Europe and in America, however, engineers have almost universally laid the flat-foot or flange rail; and in France double-headed rails, keyed in chairs, have been replaced by flange rails. On the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District Railways, on the contrary, the flange rails have been taken up and replaced by double-headed rails in chairs. The case may be briefly stated in the following terms. The double-headed rail system with chairs is the best where supplies of material and labour for maintenance and repair are always ready and available. The single-headed flange rail system is the best when the main thing to attain is simplicity in construction.

Steel rails are now very generally used instead of iron; and indeed it may be affirmed that but for the introduction of that material for rails and also for the wheel tires of locomotives the railway system would have broken down under the enormous growth of traffic. Rails of wrought-iron on the early railways lasted about twenty-five years; those of later date have been worn out in from five to ten years and in certain situations in twelve months, mainly owing to increased traffic, heavier loads on the engine-wheels, increased speed, quicker stopping and quicker starting. Steel has come to the rescue both in the engine-wheels and in the rails. Loads of from 15 to 18 tons are now placed with impunity on the single wheels of engines as well as on coupled wheels, while it appears from the investigations of Mr R. Price Williams, a leading authority on permanent way, that a fully proportioned bull-headed rail of steel outlasts fifteen or eighteen iron rails. Steel rails are not merely stronger or harder but, owing to their texture, are worn away only by simple abrasion, whereas iron rails separate out into strands as soon as the outer coating that binds them together is worn off. Mr Alfred A. Langley laid down in 1874 samples of permanent way near Stepney station on the London and Blackwall Railway, where upwards of 300 trains a day passed over a single line of way. The weight of each train was on an average about 150 tons, making a total of about 45,000 tons daily over one line of rails. The rails are both of steel and of iron, weighing 80 lb per lineal yard and keyed in cast-iron chairs on cross rectangular sleepers. The greater number of the w τ rought-iron rails had to be turned after one year and three-quarters, during which period they had worn down about one-eighth of an inch; but the necessity for reversing did not arise from the wear itself, but because they gave way in places, either bulging or splitting. The steel rails had worn about one-sixteenth of an inch in the same period. About 27,000,000 tons had passed over the line.

The rails generally, indeed almost universally, used for the way of railways are the double-headed, the bull-headed, and the flange or Vignoles rails (in the United States, Germany, Canada, and Mexico), the double-headed and the bull-headed rails being keyed into cast-iron chairs spiked to sleepers, the flanged being laid upon and fastened direct to the sleepers. The principal advantage of the flange rail is the facility with which it can be attached to the sleeper with fastenings of a simple description. The disadvantages are that it cannot be turned or reversed when the head is worn, as the double-headed rail may be, and that the rigid attachment of the rail to the sleeper causes a greater degree of disturbance of the way and involves more labour for maintenance than in the case of the double-headed rail. The double-headed rail is made heavier foτ the same class of traffic than the flange rail; but it is also stronger and is easily bent to curves, although owing to the mode of attachment to the chairs by wooden keys there is a liability to a slight longitudinal movement of the rails, known as ‘ 1 creeping.” The bull-headed rail possesses the advantages of the doubleheaded rail, except that, like the flange rail, it is not reversible. The bull-headed rail is laid on most of the railway lines of England and Scotland; the double-headed rail is also in use. In Ireland the bull-headed and the flange rails are used. Double-headed and bull-headed rails in English practice are rolled to a weight of from 82 to 86 lb per yard; the heads are made from 2⅜ to 2∣ inches wide; the webs are from five-eighths to thirteen-sixteenths of an inch in thickness; and the height of the rail varies from 5∣ to 5 j inches. The rails are now made of steel, in bars for the most part 30 feet in length, with the advantage in comparison with shorter lengths of a more solid road, fewer joints, and less cost for maintenance. They are fixed into massive cast-iron chairs, weighing from 31 to 55 lb each, by means of hard wood keys—oak. They are canted inwards in their seats at an angle usually of 1 in 20, the better to resist lateral blows from wheels. The chairs are made of considerable width on the more heavily worked lines— from 7 to 8 inches, against a minimum of 4⅜ inches on other lines. On some lines the seats of the chairs on which the rails rest are slightly rounded in the direction of the rail; this forms a compensation for slight deviations from the level in the sleepers, but is mainly useful in preventing indentation of the rails by the concussions to which they are subject—a matter - of importance with double-headed rails which are by and by to be reversed. In such cases Mr T. E. Harrison places cushions of hard wood in the chair to support the rails, which are thus effectually protected from indentation; and, in addition, the trains run more smoothly. The oak keys by which the rails are fastened in the chairs are generally applied at the outer side of the rail, as the jar caused by the lateral percussion of the flanges of wheels is then less than when the key is placed inside; but on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway the key is put at the inner side of the rail, and there is this to be said in favour of the practice, that the rails are kept firmly to gauge and the key is less likely to shift. On some railways contrivances are employed to prevent the keys from shifting or creeping out of their proper position in the chair; these will be noticed in their places. The rails are laid end to end, one-eighth or three-sixteenths of an inch apart at ordinary [9:20:242]temperatures, to allow for expansion in hot weather. The joints of the rails are united or fished with parallel steel plates lodged within the side channels of the rails and fastened with four bolts and nuts passed through the web of the rails, and, in order that the fish-plates may take a solid and steady bearing, the entering faces of the upper and lower members of the rails are in most instances formed straight and steep,—at an angle of about 2 to 1. For the same purpose the fish-plates are hollow at their inner faces, so as not to be in contact with the vertical members or web of the rails, and are slightly elastic in consequence. Vertical stiffness, also, is of prime importance in fish-plates, which act as beams fixed at the ends and uniformly loaded, being required to sustain the loads of trains passing over the joints. On some lines, accordingly, the fish-plates are made of greater depth, extending downwards along the lower table of the rail, and are even turned under it, whence they are called clip fish-plates. The chairs are laid on transverse timber sleepers, ordinarily cut from Baltic redwood to a scantling of 10 inches wide and 5 deep, and 9 feet in length,— speaking precisely, only 8 feet 11 inches in length, to secure the timber from import duty. They are most commonly submitted to a preserving process by the injection of about 2⅜ gallons of creasote into each sleeper. The chairs are fixed to the sleepers by iron spikes or oak trenails, or both, varying in number from two on the lines of lighter traffic to three or four on lines of heavier traffic. On the London and South-Western Railway and on the South-Eastern Railway a compound fastener is used,—a spike driven into a hollow trenail, after the latter is driven into the sleeper. There are usually eleven cross sleepers to each length of rails of 30 feet, making the average distance between the sleepers about 2 feet 9 inches from centre to centre. It is usual to space them apart more widely in the middle portion of the rail-bars (up to 3 feet) and more closely about the joints, with a view to equalizing the vertical resistance of the rails to rolling loads, by supplying a greater degree of support from the sleepers near the joints.

The standard models of permanent way on the double-headed rail and chair system adopted by Mr John Fowler for the New South Wales railways have been already noticed. The rails are shown in section in figs. 29 and 35. The sleepers are of colonial hard woods, chiefly iron-bark timber. They are laid 2 feet 6 inches apart between centres at the joints of the rails, and 3 feet 1 inch apart elsewhere. The upper and lower tables of the rails are curved or rounded in section to a radius of 5∣ inches, the height of the rail. The entering or overhanging faces of the rail are inclined at a slope of about 1 in 2, forming straight and equally inclined bearings to receive the fish-plates. The rails, while in course of manufacture, are tested by selecting a few rails of each day’s make, from which a portion 4⅜ feet in length is cut off and placed on iron supports 3⅜ feet apart, and is subjected to three blows from a weight of 1 ton falling 12 feet each time. The rails are to deflect not less than 6⅛ inches and not more than 7⅜ under this test without showing any signs of fracture. The fish-bolts, as well as the spikes for fastening the chairs to the sleepers, are made of the finest quality of close fibrous iron. Fifty per cent, of the rails were ordered 24 feet in length, 40 per cent. 21, and 10 per cent. 18. The chairs (fig. 30) are 13⅛ inches long at the sole, 41 wide, and 1⅜ thick at the seat of the rail. Test bars of the metal used for the chairs are cast to a scantling of 2 inches by 1 inch and 3⅜ feet long. They are placed on edge, on supports 3 feet apart, and are required to sustain a dead load of 30 cwt. suspended from the centre of the bar without fracture. The spikes are seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, tapered at the head to fifteen-sixteenths, with hemispherical or cup-heads forged from the solid bar. The above-described way, as laid in New South Wales, is bedded in ballast consisting of broken stone 12 inches in depth below the sleepers, broken to a gauge of 3 inches, boxed up with broken stone of a smaller size to a gauge of 2 inches for a depth of 8 inches. The total depth of the ballast from the crown of the formation is 22 inches.

The surface of the formation below the ballast is rounded in cross-section, in order to drain off such water as penetrates through the ballast. Grips or furrows are cut and drains laid in where necessary, so that no water is allowed to remain on the line or under the ballast.

The South-Eastern double-headed rail (fig.

31) is keyed into chairs 4⅜ inches wide and 13g long at the sole. They are fixed to the sleeper by two spikes driven into two hollow oak trenails. The sleepers at the joints are laid 2 feet 4 inches apart between centres.

The following are the quantities of material for 1 mile of way, single line :—
[table]

These quantities are considerably less than those of the Midland Railway (which are stated below), as may naturally be the case for a line chiefly of passenger traffic in comparison with one of heavy goods and mineral traffic. The double-headed rails of the North-Eastern Railway, 82 ft> per yard, are bedded on blocks or cushions of oak placed in the bottom of the chairs, the advantages of which have already been noticed.

The type section of way of the Midland Railway is shown in fig. 32. The formation is inclined each way from the centre, making two straight slopes for drainage. The ballast is of strong gravel broken stone, and ashes or clinker,—chiefly gravel. It covers a width of 26⅜ feet for two lines of way. It is laid to a depth of 16 inches at the middle of the six-foot, and is formed level with the upper sides of the sleepers between the rails in the four-foot, with a medium depth of 16 inches, or 11 inches beneath the sleepers. At the outer sides of the rails the ballast is heaped level with the tops of the chairs, or, more precisely, the tops of the keys, and is sloped down to the formation at each outer side. The upper and lower surfaces of the rail (see fig. 33) are curved to a radius equal to the height of it, and the planks are flat,—adapted for taking up lateral blows and mitigating wear.

The chairs are remarkable for large dimensions, being 7½ inches wide and

15½ long at the sole, which is 1⅞ inches thick under the rail, and for their weight,

50 lb each. The cost of relaying 1 mile of single way on the Midland system just described, based on contract prices in

1884, amounts to £1572, 8s. 5d. Deduct-

ing credit for old material to the amount of £714, 8s. 3d., the net cost of relaying is £858, 0s. 2d. The particulars of quantities, cost, and credit are given in the following statement, prepared by Mr Alfred A. Langley, the engineer of the railway :—

Not included in the above :—Ballast for 1 mile of single line, 4000 cubic yards, at 2s. = £400; ballast for 1 mile of double line, 7000 cubic yards, at 2s. = £700; ballast for a lift of about 3 inches, in relaying 1 mile of single line, 520 cubic yards, at 2s. = £52; engine hire, wages of ballast guards, use of waggons, &c., in relaying 1 mile of single line, £50. The lift of 3 inches signifies the wear and tear of ballast and the quantity required to be replaced.

The standard rail on the London and North-Western Railway is, like that of the Midland, bull-headed, but less high and wider at the head and the foot and thicker in the web. The chairs have the peculiarity of being ribbed horizontally on the inner face against which the oak key is driven, in order to grip the key. The sleepers at the joints are placed 2 feet 3 inches apart between centres. The Great Northern Company’s standard rail contrasts with the two immediately preceding rails in being less high than either, and having a thinner web and a larger head than the others. There are peculiarities in the disposition of the way. The first is that the joints of the rails are supported in a chair directly under each joint, to which the fishes are bolted; the second is that the two rails forming a line of way break joint with each other, the joints alternating from side to side, and that, as a consequence, all the sleepers are placed equally apart. On this system, it is argued, the way is of as nearly uniform strength as it is possible to make it. The keys for fixing the rails are of compressed fir.

The Great Western, the Metropolitan, and the Lancashire and Yorkshire rails are the heaviest of the bull-headed rails noticed in

Table XXVIII. (see below),—weighing 86 lb per yard, having comparatively thin webs and great development of head (see fig. 34). In the

Great Western chair the inner face of the jaw that holds the key is formed with an indenta-

tion, to aid in keeping the key in place,—the key being likely to expand into the vacancy.

In the Metropolitan way the chairs are fast ened to the sleepers by two through bolts and nuts to each chair. The rails of the

Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Rail way are placed in chairs of great length, 16¼

inches; and, contrary to usual practice, the oak keys for securing the rails in the chairs are fixed on the inner side of the rail, the rail taking its bearing directly upon the jaw of the chair. Thus the lateral strokes of the wheels on the rails are resisted directly by the jaw of the chair, and not through the medium of the key. There are twelve sleepers to each length of rail, averaging 2 feet

6 inches apart between centres, as against the usual number on other lines, eleven per rail-length of 30 feet. The sleepers, of Baltic redwood, are not creasoted nor preserved by any other process, except in one or two places where sand ballast is used.

The leading particulars of standard double-headed and bullheaded rails, with chairs and sleepers, are given in Table XXVIII. (see below).

Specimen standard flange rails are illustrated in figs. 35 and 36 in cross section. Leading particulars of flange rails are given in Table XXIX. below.

In the case of the flange rail of the New South Wales Railway (fig. 35) the inward cant of the rails is provided for by planing out by machinery the beds of the rails at the upper sides of the sleepers to the angle 1 in 20; and that the rails may be kept in gauge the beds are notched into the surface by as much as the thickness of the flange of the rail. No holes of any kind, either punched or drilled, are made in the flanges of the rails; these are fastened to the sleepers by screws and spikes alternately, having projecting heads, by which the flange is clipped and held down. In order to check the tendency to creeping of the rails as well as of the fish-plates, it is intended to flange the fish-plates and to cut a notch at each end of them, in each of which a dog-spike is to be driven into the sleepers. The Great Northern of Ireland rail is similar to Mr Fowler’s on the New South Wales Railway, but heavier. The Midland Great Western rail (fig. 36) is peculiarly formed, with a web of taper section, being nine-sixteenths of an inch thick at the head, and thickened to 1 inch at the flange. The bridge rail of the Great Western Railway (fig. 37) is laid on the model originally adopted by Mr Brunel. The rails are only 3 inches high, and are aided in resisting vertical stress by the continuous longitudinal sleepers of large scantling, 14 inches wide and

7 deep, on which they are laid, with pine packing 8 inches wide and 1 thick. The rails are laid so as to break joint with the sleepers, which are in lengths of 25 feet, whilst the rails are from 18 to 32 feet in length. The rails are fastened down by fang-bolts,
[table]
[table]
[9:20:244]

which pass through their flanges and the sleeper together. At the joints they are fortified by square iron plates laid under the joints, through which fang-bolts are passed. The longitudinals are connected and kept to gauge by transoms or cross-ties at intervals.

The minimum weight of ordinary flange rails is about 45 lb per lineal yard. If the weight is less than this for main lines the upper bearing surface is objectionably narrow, and it is scarcely high enough above the sleepers. The maximum weight of flange rails is about 80 lb per lineal yard. Flange rails, like headed rails, are laid on transverse sleepers, to which they are fixed, most commonly by means of screws, spikes, or flange bolts and nuts. In all cases it is preferable to effect the fastening of steel rails without piercing them in the flange, as they are materially weakened by such perforations.

In the United States (also very largely in Germany, Canada, and Mexico) the Yignoles rail is universally used for railways, varying in weight from 67 or 70 lb per yard on a few leading lines to 30 lb on narrow-gauge railways. No railroads with any considerable traffic are now laid down with rails of less weight than 60 lb per yard. The Pennsylvania Railroad, laid to a gauge of 4 feet 9 inches, is constructed of flange rails of two sections, one of 60 lb per yard 4 j inches high, the other of 67 lb 4J inches high, in lengths of 30 feet. The fishes or splices are 2 feet in length, held by four bolts and nuts. The outer splice is formed with a horizontal flange or “tongue,” which overhangs the flange of the rail and is spiked to the sleeper. Allowance for expansion when the rails are laid in winter is provided by laying the rails five-sixteenths of an inch apart, endwise; in summer a space of only.one-sixteenth of an inch in width is allowed. The cross sleepers are 8 inches wide by 7 deep, and are 8^ feet in length; they are laid so closely that the maximum distance apart between centres does not exceed 2 feet. There are sixteen sleepers for each length of 30 feet, and the sleepers at the joints are laid with a clearance of over 10 inches between them. The rails are fastened by spikes to the sleepers at the inside and the outside. The width for the double line of way at the formation level is 31 feet 4 inches in cuttings; and on embankments the width of the formation is 24 feet 3 inches, sloping from the centre at the rate of 1 in 20. The ballast is laid to a depth of not less than 12 inches under the sleepers, and is filled in to the level of the upper surface of the sleepers. Where stone ballast is used it is broken uniformly to a gauge of 2£ inches in diameter. For double lines of way large stones are placed in the bottom, at the centre, between the lines to provide for drainage; but the stones are not placed under the ends of the sleepers; thus water is drained off rapidly.

Metallic Permanent Way .—Metallic permanent way, in which the sleepers are of iron, has been much employed in tropical countries, and is now to some extent adopted in France and in Germany. The oldest and most widely used system of metallic way is that of Mr H, Greaves, who ' in 1846 introduced a spherical or bowl sleeper of cast-iron, having the chair for the rail cast on its summit (see fig.

38). Every second pair of sleepers are connected and held to gauge by transverse tie-bars, which pass through and are bolted to them. The form of the sleeper is strong, it holds well in the ground, the chair is not liable to be detached, the whole bearing surface is directly beneath the road, the ballast is kept dry and elastic, and there is a simple means of packing the sleeper through holes in the top, with a pointed rammer from the surface, so that the sleeper and the rail can be forced upwards without disturbing the general bed of ballast. They may also be lowered by taking out a portion of ballast from the interior. Another system, Mr W. Bridges Adams’s “suspended girder rail,” is shown in fig. 39. The rail is 7 inches deep, weighing 65 lb per lineal yard, and is suspended by continuous angle-wires, or side wings bolted to it, and bedded in the ballast; and, as the bearing surface on the ballast was approximated to the bearing surface of the rail, a great degree of stability was anticipated. Wrought - iron transverse sleepers were first tried in Belgium in 1862, then in France and in Portugal, and afterwards in Germany. There are various systems, most of which were׳ unsatisfactory, but the Yautherin sleeper, first tried in 1864 on the Lyons railway, has been successful. It is hollow in section, of the form A truncated, supposing the upper part of the letter to be removed, presenting a flat bearing surface, 3.| inches wide, for a flange rail. It is 8 feet in length and 9 inches wide over the flanges forming the base. It is three-eighths of an inch thick at the centre and is only half that thickness in the wings. The rail is fixed to the sleeper with gibs and cotters. It has been reported that the motion over the Vautlierin sleepers is much easier than that over sleepers of oak, and that in consequence the cost of maintenance is comparatively low. It is stated that amongst a number of rails laid for trial under similar conditions, some of them on wooden sleepers and some of them on Yautherin sleepers, the number of defective rails amounted to only 2^ per cent, of those laid on Yautherin sleepers against 13 per cent, of those laid on wood. It was found that if the Vautherin sleepers were not at least 8 feet in length they failed at the ends, and that even for this length it was expedient to strengthen them at the angles. It was also found that large and hard ballast, or broken stoqes or broken slag, aggravated the tendency to give way. Ballast of ashes produced a similar bad effect, and also caused the sleepers to rust. On the contrary, ballast of gravel, of a marly character, adapted itself admirably to the form of the sleeper. The system of fastening the rails to the sleepers by gibs and cotters has been abandoned in favour of clips and liook-bolts. The Hartwich system of iron way need not be described here, having always given bad results. The Hilf system of iron way consists of two parts,—an iron longitudinal sleeper and a flange rail of steel. It is simple, easily laid and maintained, and economical. The sleeper is in section like the letter E, bevelled at the angles, having an upper flat surface and three flanges downwards. It is 12 inches wide and about 2£ deep; and it can be rolled to lengths of 30 feet and only one-third of an inch in thickness, and to a weight of 59 lb per yard. The rail is 432־ inches high, with 232־ inches width of table, 340־ width of flange base, and four-tenths of an inch thickness of web. It is rolled in lengths of 30 feet and weighs 5H lb per yard. It is fish-jointed and is fixed to the sleeper with two rows of bolts and nuts at intervals of from 30 to 40 inches. The gauge is preserved by means of 1-inch tie-rods, screwed at both ends with nuts. One tie-rod is sufficient for each length of rail. The combined rail and sleeper, placed on supports 54 inches apart, can carry 18 tons at their middle, without impairing their elastic strength.

Locomotive Power.

Locomotives may broadly be reduced to two classes, according to the situation of the working cylinders. In the first class these are within the framing, under the boiler, with the main driving axle cranked at two points to receive the power from the two cylinders; in the second class they are outside the framing, and connected, not to the axle, which is straight, but to crank-pins fixed between the spokes of the wheels, in connexion with the nave. From these distinguishing features the two types of engines are known respectively as “inside cylinder locomotives” and “outside cylinder locomotives.” In the latter the general contour of the cylinders is usually visible at the fore-end of the machine. The tenders have six or four wheels, according to the taste of the designer, and they are supplied with powerful brakes, worked by screws, with blocks of wood placed against each wheel. A water-tank forms the upper part of the tender, namely, the two sides and the back, usually in the form of a horse-shoe, holding from 1000 to 3000 gallons; and in the hollow of the shoe the fuel is deposited, of which a full charge may weigh from 30 cwt. to 3^ tons. The engine and the tender are sustained on springs placed over the axle-bearings. Again, there is the general classification of locomotives into passenger engines and goods and mineral engines. As the power of the engine is brought into action through the grip of the driving wheels upon the rails, it is necessary, for the exertion of maximum power in goods engines, to make two or more pairs of the wheels of one ·size, and transmit the driving force from the central pair of wheels to the front and back pairs by means of coupling-rods attached to crank-pins at the naves of the wheels. Such engines are called “six-coupled,” and for them the most convenient combination is with inside cylinders. When the cylinders are outside it is usual to couple only the hind pair of wheels to the driving wheels, making a “ four-coupled” engine, the leading or front wheels being of smaller diameter than the driving-wheels, and so leaving room for the convenient placement of the cylinders. The six-coupled engine can take the heaviest train on a good straight railway,—that is, one free for the most part from curves; but four-coupled engines work more economically on lines with frequent curves, and may be made so as to take, in average practice, as great a load as six-coupled engines. Passenger locomotives have usually been constructed with a single pair of driving-wheels, for free running at high speeds; but as traffic became heavier four-coupled-wheel passenger engines came into vogue: and express trains are · now for the most part worked with four-coupled engines. In recent years the forepart of engines has in many cases been placed on a four-wheeled truck connected [9:20:245]by a central bolt or pivot to the frame of the engine, so that the fore-wheels can swing to the curves of the line. On the Metropolitan, Metropolitan District, and North London Railways entirely, and on many large railway systems partially, where sharp curves are frequent, bogie-engines are employed, and with great advantage in facilitating traction. Another device for the same purpose is the use of radial axles,—that is, axles either at the forepart or the back of the engine, which by their axle-boxes slide laterally between circularly formed guides on entering and on leaving curved parts of the way, and so maintain a radial position at right angles to the line of rails.

American practice, many years since, arrived at two leading types of locomotive for passenger and for goods traffic. The passenger locomotive has eight wheels, of which four in front are framed in a bogie, and the four wheels behind are coupled drivers. This is the type to which English practice has been approximating. The tender is carried on eight wheels, disposed under two trucks or bogies, fore and aft. Goods locomotives are made with eight wheels and with ten wheels, of which, in each case, the leading pair of wheels are connected with a swing bolster and radius bar, to conform laterally and radially to curves.

As the speed increases a more than proportional increase in the engine-power is necessary to draw a given train. Thus, if an engine and tender, weighing together 40 tons and exerting a given tractive force, takes, say, forty loaded carriages, weighing 360 tons, at 20 miles per hour on a level, the loads which it could take if it exerted the same tractive power at higher speeds would be only as follows :—
[table]

The influence of gradients also is very important. If an engine and tender, weighing together 40 tons, is capable of drawing a maximum train of, say, forty-two loaded carriages, weighing 420 tons, at 20 miles per hour on a level, it would only draw the following loads at the same speed on the following inclines :—
[table]

This is the reason why the older railways were made nearly level at an enormous cost,—the elder Stephenson’s policy being to incur a large expenditure in construction in order to avoid otherwise heavy inclines and heavy expenses. The ruling gradient of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was fixed at 1 in 900, excepting, of course, the inevitable inclines at Rainhill summit, for working which special provision was made; that of the next great line, the London and Birmingham, was fixed at 1 in 330; on the Great Western Railway, one of the earliest made lines, the ruling inclination is 1 in 1320 for the greater part of the way. Locke, as already explained, initiated the system of cheaply constructed railways, as the facilities for increasing the power of locomotives became betteι - understood; he constructed lines with long steep gradients, some of them 1 in 70, 1 in 75, 1 in 80. The Great Northern Railway, of comparatively recent origin, was constructed on a ruling gradient of 1 in 200; and, in general, the more recently made lines have the steepest gradients. Steep railways are generally also lines of frequent curves, which is another cause of loss of locomotive power. Moreover, the ruling speeds, as they may be called, have in the course of years increased. Thus in every way more powerful engines are now needed than in the early days of railways.

The fundamental characteristics of English practice are fairly represented by a few types of locomotives. Take first an express passenger locomotive, which stands on a wheel base—the distance apart of the centres of the extreme axles—of 15 feet 4 inches. The cylinders are inside and are 16 inches in diameter, with a slide of 22 inches. The driving-wheels are 7 feet in diameter. The firegrate has an area of 18 square feet, and the heating surface of the fire-box and flue-tubes taken together is 1339 square feet. The total weight of the engine in working order is 28 tons 6 cwt., of which nearly 12 tons are driving weight,—the weight at the driving-wheels. The tender stands on three pairs of wheels and weighs about 16 tons, with, in addition, 1780 gallons or 8 tons of water when filled, and 3 tons of coal.

The “Lady of the Lake” is an express passenger locomotive, one of a class which was designed by Mr John Ramsbottom with special regard to the running of express trains on the northern division of the London and North-Western Railway. The cylinders are “outside”; they are 16 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of stroke, and the driving-wheels are 7 feet 7 inches in diameter. The fire-grate has an area of 15 square feet, and there is over 1000 square feet of heating surface. The engine weighs 27 tons in working order and the tender 17⅜, together 44⅜ tons. The tender is fitted with Mr Ramsbottom’s apparatus for picking up feed-water whilst running: a scoop is let down from the bottom of the tender and dips into water contained in a long open trough, laid between the rails, from which it is scooped up into the tanks. The minimum speed at which this operation can be effected is 22 miles per hour. By the aid of the water-lifter this express engine has been enabled to run the whole distance from Holyhead to London—264 miles— in one continuous run, at an average speed of 42 miles per hour, taking a train of eight or nine carriages, and consuming 27 lb of coal as fuel per mile run.

An express passenger locomotive having 18-inch cylinders and four-coupled driving-wheels, 7 feet in diameter, with a four-wheel bogie in front under the smoke - box, was designed by Mr T. W. Johnson for the traffic of the Midland Railway. The engine stands on eight wheels, forming a base 21⅜ feet long. It weighs about 42 tons in working order, and with the tender, including coal and water, about 68 tons. The average load taken by engines of this class is fourteen carriages at the time-bill speed of 50 miles per hour, over gradients of from 1 in 120 to 1 in 130, with a consumption of 28 lb of coal per mile run. The engine can take as a maximum load seventeen carriages between Manchester and Derby, over ruling gradients of 1 in 90 and 1 in 100 for 10 miles, at a speed up the inclines of 35 miles per hour, and on levels and falling gradients at 50 miles per hour. The carriages weigh, with passengers, 11 tons each, making up a train of the gross weight of 187 tons.

The express passenger engines on the Great Northern Railway (fig. 40), designed by Mr Patrick Stirling, have outside cylinders, 18

inches in diameter, and a single pair of 8-feet driving-wheels. It is one of the most recent developments of the single-wheel engine. It is placed on eight wheels, of which the first four are framed in a bogie, or truck, pivoted on a centre under the smoke-box. The cylinders are placed outside, and between the wheels of the bogie at each side. They are 18 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 28 inches,—dimensions which, taken together, exceed in magnitude those of any other engine for English passenger-traffic. The driving-wheels are 8 feet 1 inch in diameter and the bogie-wheels 3 feet 11 inches. The engine weighs 38 tons in working order, the distribution of the weight being as follows :—
[table]

The pivot of the bogie is 6 inches nearer the hind than the front axle,—these being 6⅜ feet apart. By this disposition the' bogie appears to lead better than if the pivot were, as usual, equidistant between the axles. The working pressure in the boiler is 140 lb per square inch. There are 217 brass flue-tubes, l-9/16 inches in diameter, presenting a heating surface for evaporation of upwards of 1000 square feet. There is in all 1165 square feet of surface, and there is 17'6 square feet of grate surface. Mr Stirling, on the question of single-wheel versus coupled wheels for passenger locomotives, states that he constructed two classes of engines,—one class with four 6½-feet wheels coupled, the other with a single pair of 7-feet driving-wheels. The boilers of the two classes were alike; also the cylinders, which were 17 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of stroke. The pressure in the boilers was 140 lb. With like trains the single-wheel engine had the better of it; in fact, it generally beat the coupled engine in time, running from King’s Cross to Potter’s Bar, a distance of nearly 13 miles, nearly all uphill, the gradients varying from 1 in 105 for 2 miles to 1 in 200. Engines of the class of the 8-feet-wheel engine travel between King’s Cross and Leeds or York. The steepest gradients on the route are met with on leaving Leeds, ascending 1 in 50, besides the gradient 1 in 105 leaving King’s Cross. Trains of from sixteen to twenty-two carriages are taken from King’s Cross station with ease; and on several occasions twenty-eight carriages have been taken, and time has been kept. On one occasion a distance of 15 miles in [9:20:246]twelve minutes was accomplished with a train of sixteen carriages, making a speed of 75 miles j>er hour. The engine has taken a train of thirty-three carriages full of passengers from Doncaster to Scarborough and back at an average speed of 45 miles per hour.

It is capable of moving a gross weight, including engine, tender, and train, of 356 tons on a level at a speed of 45 miles per hour. The average results of the regular performance of seven engines of this class between Doncaster, Peterborough, and London for the third quarter of 1884 show that a train of twelve six-wheeled carriages weighing 13 tons each was taken at a speed of from 50 to 53 miles per hour, for a consumption of 25¿ lb of coal per mile run and five pints of oil per 100 miles run.

Four-coupled locomotives, having the cylinders inside, and four wheels coupled “in front,” with a pair of hind or trailing wheels, are known as “mixed engines,”—that is to say, engines adapted for either passenger traffic or goods traffic,—a generally useful type. In one example the cylinders are 16 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 22 inches; the coupled wheels are 5 feet in diameter. The weight of the engine is 244 tons, of which 20 tons are driving weight.

The next engine to be noticed is a generally useful engine, four-coupled “behind,” for passenger traffic, such, for instance, as that with inclined fire-grate and sloping fire-box designed by Mr J. J. Cudworth for service on the South-Eastern Railway. Chi a wheelbase of 15 feet the weight of the engine—30£ tons—is so distributed that 10| tons fall at each pair of driving-wheels and 94 tons at the leading wheels. The cylinders are inside, 16 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of stroke and 6-feet driving-wheels.

Another express passenger locomotive, having inside cylinders and four-coupled wheels behind, for service on the London and North-Western Railway, has cylinders 17 inches in diameter, with 24 inches of stroke, and 6 feet 7 inch driving wheels. The engine weighs 29| tons, of which 11 are at the middle wheels, 8f at the hind wheels, and 94 at the front; thus the driving weight amounts to two-thirds of the total weight. This engine can move a gross weight of 293 tons, comprising engine, tender, and train, on a level at a speed of 45 miles per hour, with a working pressure of 120 lb per square inch in the boiler. With trains averaging ten carriages the consumption of coal is 26| lb per mile run.

A tank locomotive is an engine which carries its supply of fuel and water with it on its own frame, dispensing with the tender. Such engines are mticli used for short traffic, as well as for shunting and marshalling trains.

The four-coupled tank engine (fig. 41) used for the passenger traffic of the Metropolitan Railway has four wheels coupled behind and a bogie in front. This engine weighs in working order 45£ tons, of which about 35 tons are utilized as driving weight, making 17| tons for one pair of wheels,—about the greatest load on one pair of wheels anywhere. The regular duty of this engine is to take a train of six carriages capable of holding in all 432 passengers, and weighing in themselves 13 tons each, at an average speed, including stoppages, of 18 miles per hour, consuming 37 lb of Welsh coal per train mile run. Whilst passing through the tunnels or covered ways the exhaust steam from the engine is condensed in large tanks carried on the engine, filled with cold water. The quantity of condensing water consumed is 900 gallons for half the journey, or every 6¿ miles; it is raised to 200° Fahr. temperature.

The eight-wheeled tank engine (fig. 42) has been designed by Mr

T. W. Worsdell to work the heavy suburban metropolitan traffic of the Great Eastern Railway,—the ordinary trains in this service being composed of fifteen or twenty close-coupled carriages, taken over steep gradients and sharp curves. For this purpose the fore and hind axles are radially mounted, as before explained, to take the curves with facility, the engine running either end first. The engine weighs 52 tons in working order, and of these 30 tons are driving weight placed on the two pairs of coupled driving-wheels. With large cylinders 18 inches in diameter, and driving-wheels only 5 feet 4 inches in diameter, the engine is adapted for starting promptly, which it is required to do in order to keep time between closely placed stations. Every stop is made by the Westinghouse brake, with which the engine is fitted.

Locomotives for drawing heavy goods trains, though not heavier than the most powerful passenger locomotives, can take goods trains of great weight. Six-coupled goods engines, with 17-inch cylinders and driving-wheels 5 feet in diameter, weighing 32 tons in working order, can take a train weighing 360 tons on a level at a speed of 25 miles per hour, consuming from 40 to 45 lb of coal per mile run with trains. The Fairlie engine (fig. 43) is placed on two bogies or swivelling trucks, the foremost of which carries the cylinders and propelling gear and the hindmost the tank and coal-boxes.

The longest distance run without stopping, combined with the' highest speed, is performed on the Great Northern Railway, between! Grantham and King’s Cross, 105J miles, in 1 hour 58 minutes, at the rate of 53£ miles per hour. The Great Western Company run from Paddington to Swindon—77£ miles—in 1 hour 27 minutes, being at the rate of 53¿ miles per hour. On the London and North-Western Railway the distance—77| miles—from Willesden to Rugby is run in 1 hour 28 minutes, at the rate of 52f miles per hour. The average rate of express and mail passenger trains on this line is 40 miles per hour or more. Parliamentary trains, calling at all stations, run at an average speed of from 19 to 28 miles per hour. Express goods trains attain a speed of from 20 to 25 miles per hour. The speed of coal trains is limited, as far as possible, to 15 miles per hour.

The coal trains on the London and North-Western, Midland, and Great Northern Railways generally consist of from thirty to thirty-five waggons, weighing from 5 to 54 tons each, and carrying a load of 8 tons of coal. At this rate the total load of coal for thirty-five waggons weighs 280 tons, and, adding the weight of the brake-van at the end of the train, 10 tons 17 cwt., the maximum gross weight of train is 483 tons 7 cwt., as on the Great Northern Railway. This train is taken by a goods engine with six-coupled wheels 54 feet in diameter, having two steam cylinders 174 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 26 inches, and a pressure of 140 lb per square inch in the boiler. The locomotive weighs in working order 36 tons 18 cwt., and the tender with fuel and water 30 tons 17 cwt., making together 67 tons 15 cwt. for the locomotive and tender. The gross weights are as follows:—

Tons, cwts

Train, thirty-five vehicles (waggons, load, and brake-van). .4S3 7

Engine, tender, and train ................................551 2

These large coal trains are taken at a speed of IS miles per hour, on ascending inclines of 1 in 178 at 10 miles per hour. The consumption of coal as fuel in the engine is at the rate of 45 lb per mile run, including the coal consumed in getting up steam. Mr Patrick Stirling, the locomotive engineer of the Great Northern Railway, has also designed and constructed still more powerful engines, having six-coupled 5-feet wheels, with cylinders 19 inches in diameter and of 28 inches stroke. These engines are capable of taking a train of forty-nine loaded coal-waggons, weighing with brake-van 672j tons. Including the weight of the engine and tender the total gross load is, say, 740 tons, taken with a consumption of 50 lb of coal per mile run. This is probably the most extraordinary example of a dead pull on an ascending incline of 1 in 178. It is equivalent to a gross weight of 1816 tons on a level. It was found that this train was too long for some of the sidings, besides fouling both the level crossings in the city of Lincoln; hence the train was reduced in number to forty-five waggons. Six-coupled goods-engines of the usual proportions, working at full power, exert a tractive force of from 5 to 6 tons in the direction of the rails, equal to the movement of a gross weight of engine, tender, and train of from 1240 to 1500 tons on a level straight line at a speed of 15 miles per hour, or to from 386 to 463 tons on a level [9:20:247]straight line at a speed of 60 miles per hour. A tractive force of 10 or 12 lb is capable of drawing 1 ton on a level at 10 miles per hour. At 60 miles per hour the required tractive force is about 45 lb for 1 ton of gross weight.

Carriages and Waggons. is The common varieties of vehicle employed in railway traffic are as follows :—(1) Passenger-train stock: first-class carriage, second-class carriage, third-class carriage, composite carriage, luggage brake-van, horse-box, carriage-truck. To these may be added the mail - carriage or travelling post-office. (2) Goods-train stock: platform-waggon, open or box waggon, high-sided round-end waggon, covered goods - waggon, cattle - waggon, sheep - waggon, coal-waggon, coke-waggon, brake-van. Besides these there are other waggons specially designed for special traffic, as gunpowder, salt, and lime, also ballast-waggons, for the private use of the engineer’s department. Carriages are usually made of the same external length, width, and height. The under works of the stock may thus be identical in construction, and an economical uniformity of working and wearing parts is secured. Uniformity of waggons is still more important than in the case of carnages, as their total number and cost are much greater, and the supervision with which they are favoured is less minute; besides, the cost of maintenance is less than where many varieties of waggon exist on the same line. · But, whatever may be the upper works, the under works of the whole of the waggon stock should be entirely uniform. One of the greatest evils of railway engineering has been want of uniformity in stock, partly due to different companies not arranging to have stock suitable for joint use on each other’s lines and partly to inevitable changes of plan to meet the growing wants of traffic. Another source of mischief was the separation of the duties of engine and of carriage and waggon superintendence. The carriage superintendent, aiming at the utmost economy of maintenance in his department, continually added to the quantity and weight of material employed in the construction of the carrying stock, as the remedy for the observed failure of weak parts; and thus the stock, particularly waggons, was increased in strength rather by adding to the mass of matter than by studying to throw the same weight of timber and iron into superior combinations. Meantime the heavy trains, handed over to the locomotive department, led to the construction of heavier and more powerful locomotives, when the maximum was quickly reached, and strongly evinced by the damage done to the permanent way. It was found, moreover, that the older carriages suffered most in cases of collision; hence there was an additional inducement to add to the size and weight of carriages. But this line of development has been mainly determined by the demands of the public for greater convenience, speed, and safety, and from the growth of traffic, involving greater length and weight of trains.

The early first-class carriages weighed 3£ tons, the bodies or upper parts being 15 feet long, 6| feet wide, and 4 feet 9 inches high, divided into three compartments, to hold six passengers each, or eighteen in all. They now weigh from 8 to 13 tons each, and are from 20 to 30 feet in length and from 8 to 8^ feet wide. Carriages have until recent years been placed almost all on four wheels; but six wheels on three axles are now generally in use. A modern first-class carriage, 28 to 30 feet long with four compartments, gives 7 to 7i feet of total length for each compartment, as against 5 feet in the early carriages. Second and third class carriages, in length from 28 to 31 feet, are divided into five compartments, each from 5 feet 7 inches to 6 feet 2 inches long. Saloon carriages are occasionally used, so called because two or more of the ordinary compartments are merged in one. Second-class carriages originally were destitute of cushioning, hard and square, on the nearly obsolete policy of making them uncomfortable in the hope of inducing passengers to travel first class. The London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway Company in 1857-58 were the first to supply comfortably padded seats in their second-class carriages, and the receipts of that company were in 1858 materially augmented in consequence. Third-class carriages have been improved, under the stimulating example of the Midland Railway Company, who abandoned their second-class carriages, and raised their third-class stock to an equality with the second-class vehicles of other lines. But there are yet lines of railway on which the third-class carriages are little better than obsolete first and second class carriages converted into third-class.

Passenger luggage brake-vans are made open (for the most part) inside for passengers’ luggage. They are fitted with a dog-box or small enclosure from side to side with doors at both ends, and with projecting sides, glazed, to accommodate the guard and afford a view r of the train from end to end. A pair of doors are placed in each side for luggage. In some designs a separate compartment is partitioned off for the guard, in other cases a compartment of a passenger carriage is allotted for luggage and for the guard. The luggage van is fitted with a powerful brake; it should be fitted with three pairs of wheels. Horse-boxes are constructed to carry three horses.

The long double-bogie passenger-car universally in use in the United States, originally introduced by Ross "VVinans on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, is distinguished essentially from the carriages on British railways by the longitudinal passage in the centre of the body, reaching from end to end of the car, with seats at each side, and admitting of the free passage of the conductor throughout the train. The absence of doors at the sides permits of the enlargement of the body laterally. These cars are also distinguished by the use of two four-wheeled bogies or trucks on which the body is carried, and to which it is pivoted, allowing the car to pass with facility over quick curves. There is generally but one class of travellers; yet for the long journeys Pullman and other sleeping cars have come into use, at extra fares. From the Atlantic cities to the West there is a special “immigrant” class, as also over the Pacific railroads; and between the chief Western cities and the seaboard of late years a second-class system has been begun: passengers are usually carried in smoking cars at rates but little lower than first-class fares, which on these lines are about Id. per mile. Refreshment cars are also attached to trains. Ordinary passenger cars are 9| to 10 feet wide and 44$ in length of body, or 49 feet over the extreme platforms. They are about 7$ feet high at the sides, inside the body, and nearly 10 feet high at the centre. The car is entered by steps at the ends. The middle passage is about 2 feet vdde. On each side there are fourteen seats, placed transversely, each 38 inches wide and holding two persons. The backs of the seats, which do not rise more than 34 inches above the floor, are mounted on swivels, by which the seat is made reversible. A window is placed next each seat, having a movable glass and a Venetian blind. The cars are heated by stoves or steam heaters, burning coal, and are lighted by oil-lamps or candles, on some lines by compressed coal-gas. Each car is provided with a water-closet and a supply of iced v r ater, and a vendor of books, papers, and cigars patrols the cars. There is a cord of communication with the engine-driver. The car, complete, weighs from 17 to 20 tons, and sleeping cars about one-half more.

The form of goods truck generally used for some years after the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1829 was simply a platform about 10 feet long, on four wheels, with sides varying from 4 to 10 inches in height, weighing from 2£ to 3| tons. Many such waggons were employed for transporting heavy rough goods of 2 tons weight. The general unfitness of this style of waggon led to the adoption of portable sides and ends, which consisted of open crib-rails dropped into staples; and to these was added the costly tarpauling or sheet to cover the goods and bind them down. The waggon thus appointed, 13 or 14 feet in length and weighing about 3£ tons, was fit to carry 4 or 5 tons of ordinary goods. But loose or removable parts of waggons are liable to be lost or get out of order, and are costly to maintain, while a new tarpauling may be spoiled on the first day of using it by injury from projecting angles of goods under cover. Crib-rails and tarpaulings, therefore, have been to some extent superseded by built covered waggons from 14 to 16 feet long and 7\ feet wide, with sliding or hinged doors and roofs, so that with the crane-chairs a bale of goods, however heavy, can be deposited at or moved from any part of the interior of the waggon, and the goods may be pei’fectly enclosed and protected from damage by fire, wind, or rain. Covered waggons weigh from 4 to 6| tons, and they can carry, according to their dimensions, from 6 to 8 tons of goods. The cost of maintenance of ordinary open waggons is said to amount to from 7 to 10 per cent of the first cost, whilst that of covered waggons is said to be only 4 per cent. It may be stated generally that waggons if properly made will carry 60 per cent, more than their own weight of goods, but that ill-designed badly-made waggons will carry no more than their own weight of goods. The great demand for weight in waggons arose, as much as from anything else, from the absence of sprin״-buffers at the ends, which exposed them daily to rude and trying collisions. By and by buffing-springs were introduced at one end of the waggon, the other being left “dead,” and at length, cheap and convenient buffers having been devised, springs came to be placed at both ends of new stock. "Waggons, as formerly made, were .in long trains likewise subjected to violent shocks in starting into motion, and therefore the draw-bars also were placed upon springs. Some companies have gone further and placed the guard or side chains upon springs. Thus the waggon has come to be defended by springs at all points, and there is no doubt that the extra cost so incurred has been amply covered by savings on repairs and diminished breakages of goods. Spiral springs for buffing and drawing, made of round or of oval steel, fixed externally to the ends of waggons, have been much employed; but laminated springs, placed under the floor, are taking their place. Broad-gauge (7-feet gauge) waggons have been constructed sufficiently strong to carry 20 tons of load on six wheels; but they were not generally made to carry more than 10 tons. Even 10 tons is considered in some quarters to be excessive as a maximum waggon-load on the ordinary or 4 feet 8£ inch gauge. On the Midland Railway, for instance, the standard coal - waggon is constructed to carry 8 tons. The [9:20:248]heavier the load for which mineral vehicles are constructed, the greater is the tear and wear of the stock, insomuch that the waggons on that line which stood to their work best were the old 6-ton waggons.

Railway carriages are composed of two distinct parts,—the underframe or substructure, and the body or superstructure. The underframe has to carry the body and to resist the stress of work. It should be on axles placed well apart, and should be firmly framed together, of hard wood, with iron tie-rods, brackets, knees, straps, bolts, and nuts. Powerful laminated springs are lodged Within the frame to take the pull of the train through the central drawbars and to intercept and absorb the thrusts of the buffers at the ends through the buffing-rods. On the Midland Railway four-

Each of these carriages is fitted With a vacuum brake. In the beginning of 1885 there Were 837 bogie carriages at work on the Midland Railway, inclusive of 34 Pullman cars. The bogie cars, in virtue of their ability to swing their bogies to the curves on the line, run more freely than ordinary carriages, which have parallel axles. Six-wheeled carriages are enabled to run the more freely by an allowance of lateral play for the axle-boxes of the middle axle between the axle-guards, whereby the wheels adapt themselves freely to the rails on curves. The Pullman cars in use on the Midland Railway were sent from America. They are of two kinds, —the drawing-room for day service and the sleeping-car. The body of the cars is 51½ feet in length externally and 8 feet 9 inches wide. Inside the body is 8 feet 2 inches wide, and 8 feet 6½ inches high above the floor. The total length, including the gangways at the ends, is 58 feet. Each car is mounted on two four-wheeled bogies. There are seats for twenty-seven persons in the drawingroom car, with lavatories and heating apparatus, and twenty-two beds are made up in each sleeping-car. The cars weigh 21½ tons and their cost is £2700 each.

The carriage stock of the Metropolitan Railway was designed to carry large numbers. The bodies of the carriages are 39½ feet in length and 8½ feet wide outside, running on eight wheels, of which the extreme axles radiate, or are movable laterally to suit the curves of the way. The first-class carriages are divided into six compartments, providing seats for forty-eight passengers. The second and third class carriages have eight compartments, holding altogether eighty passengers in each. These carriages weigh 13 tons each.

The waggon stock of the Midland Railway is of several classes. All the standard goods and mineral waggons, as well as cattle-waggons, are constructed to carry 8 tons. Leading dimensions, weights, and prices are given below in Table XXXI. :—
[table]

The covered goods waggons are made with a doorway at each side, 5 feet wide and 5 high, and a sliding door to each doorway. The high-sided waggons are made with a doorway and hinged door in each side, and two trap-doors in the bottom. In the low-sided waggons each side is a door for its whole length. The cattle-waggons are made with doorways in each side, to each of which there are two doors hinged to each doorpost, and a letting-down door hinged to the lower side-rail. All the waggons are fitted with transverse buffing and draw springs.

Lighting of Carriages.— The North London Railway Company, it is believed, were the first to use gas instead of oil for lighting carriage stock. Thirty gas-lights in a train are supplied from two reservoirs or gasholders in the brake-vans, which hold 200 cubic feet of ordinary coal-gas, supplied from the mains,—enough to serve the train for from two hours to two and a half hours. The gas is conducted by pipes over the roofs of the carriages, with a branch wheeled carriages are (1885) being gradually superseded by sixwheeled and long bogie carriages. Four varieties of bogie carriage and three varieties of six-wheeled carriage are constructed for the service. First-class compartments are constructed to seat six persons, three on each side; third-class compartments seat ten persons, five on each side. A uniform width of 8 feet outside, or 7½ inside, is adopted for all carriages; and, as a rule, first-class compartments are 7¼ feet long between the partitions, and third-class compartments 6 feet long. The roof is 7 feet 4 inches above the floor at the centre, and the clear height of the doorway is 6 feet. The wheels are 3 feet 7½ inches in diameter. Leading particulars of the several kinds of carriage now constructed on the Midland Railway are given in Table XXX. as follows :—
[table]

to each compartment. Ordinary coal-gas has also been used on the metropolitan railways. Pintsch’s system of lighting carriages by compressed oil-gas is extensively in use on Continental railways, where it has been in operation for upw τ ards of ten years. In 1876-77 the system was tried successfully on the Metropolitan Railway, when it appeared that 1000 cubic feet of the compressed gas could do the work of 6500 cubic feet of coal-gas, at a cost of scarcely one farthing per burner per hour, against one-third of a penny for coal-gas lamps, and from ½d. to ¾d. for oil-lamps. The gas is distilled from cheap oils, as the waste - products from the manufacture of paraffin, soft lignite, or shale. The gas is pumped from the gasholder into reservoirs, in which it is compressed to about one-tenth of its ordinary volume. From these it is drawn off into a reservoir stowed under each carriage at a pressure of six atmospheres, or 90 lb per square inch. The Pintsch system is in use on railways in England and Scotland on nearly 3000 vehicles, and is being extended to other stock; the number of vehicles thus lighted in all the railways of Europe is about 18,000. Besides, the system is employed for the head-lights of locomotives.

Intercommunication signals for railway trains are provided between driver and guard, driver and passengers, or passengers and guard. Electric means of communication have been proposed and tried, but mechanical appliances are most commonly employed. There is the ordinary guard’s cord, extending along the train outside, placed so as to be accessible from the window; then there are the same cord, with an attachment coming inside the window, the English cord, connected with a bell in the driving cab, a line inside the carriage connected with the steam-whistle, and so on. The acoustic signals appear to belong to the last type; but none of these systems is comparable with the through middle passage of the American cars already noticed.

Continuous Brakes.— No department of railway practice has in recent years received closer attention and more minute study than that of continuous brakes,—brakes applied to the several vehicles in a train. With the amount of brake-power that had for many years been supplied to passenger trains—hand-brakes on tenders and guards’ vans—a train running at from 45 to 50 miles per hour on a straight level line could not be pulled up within from 800 to 1200 yards; and even that inadequate amount of brake-power was in the hands of several men. It was clear that the problem of arresting a train in the shortest distance could only be solved by bringing a power to bear on every part of the train in the shortest possible time. But the difficulty consisted in establishing continuity of action, so that the engine-driver or the guard should be enabled to apply the brake-blocks on a series of vehicles in one operation. Mechanical means were first tried, in the systems of Fay and Newall, in which the brakes are worked by a continuous rod passed under the vehicles. These systems were found to be available only on sections of not more than four or five vehicles, and were not worked by the driver but by the guard. In September 1858 a circular was issued by the Board of Trade to the railway companies, calling attention to the advantages to be derived from having their trains controlled by a sufficient amount of brake-power. Subsequently many inventions were tried,—brakes worked by fluid pressure, others worked by chains; but no practical solution of the problem appears to have been arrived at until Mr Westinghouse of Pittsburgh, U.S.A., invented a really continuous brake worked by compressed air, which was quickly adopted in the United States, and was tried a few years later on several railways in England. It is still (1885) employed exclusively on the Metropolitan District Railway.

Although the Westinghouse brake was greatly in advance of previously existing systems and answered ordinary requirements [9:20:249]remarkably well, it became evident that for the worst types of accidents something more was wanted. The brake as first produced was non-automatic, being worked from the engine only, not by the guard. And, since the power had to travel from the engine along the whole length of the train, there was a loss of valuable seconds of time whilst the brake-blocks were being applied. Mr Westing-house therefore designed a system by which each vehicle was supplied with a complete brake apparatus, carrying its own store of power in the form of an auxiliary reservoir of compressed air, in addition to the brake cylinder already there. By the action of the “triple valve ”—a later introduction—which is fitted to each smaller reservoir on the branch by which it is connected to the main or brake-pipe, the brakes can be instantly applied. A store of compressed air is maintained throughout the train in the continuous pipe and auxiliary reservoirs; and so long as the pressure in these is maintained the brakes are kept off. By a reduction of the pressure in the pipe the triple valve is brought into action, and the compressed air in the reservoir flows into the brake-cylinder and applies the brake. The brake can be at once released by restoring the pressure in the brake-pipe, when the compressed air in the cylinder escapes into the atmosphere. In the event of a train being parted and the brake-pipe severed, the escape of air reduces the pressure in the pipe, and the brakes are instantly self-applied. They have thus become known as “automatic” brakes. The compressed air by the agency of which the Westinghouse automatic brake is worked is stored in a main reservoir on the engine, as well as in the local reservoirs under the carriages, at a pressure of from 70 to 80 lb per square inch. The air is compressed by means of a steam-pump attached to the engine and worked by steam from the boiler. The compressed air is supplied through the brake-pipe, which passes through the whole length of the train to the secondary reservoirs. A brake-cylinder is fixed near each secondary reservoir, and the charge enters the cylinder at the middle of its length between the pistons, which are driven apart, one towards each end of the cylinder, and act, through piston-rods and levers, upon the brake-blocks which are applied to the wheels. The pistons are maintained in their central positions in the brake-cylinder, when out of action, by spiral springs which abut on the ends of the cylinders; and so the brake-blocks are kept clear of the wheels. The general arrangement of the brake-apparatus applied to a carriage is shown in fig. 44; and the reservoir and brake-cylinder, with their connexions to each other and to the main pipe, and the intermediary triple valve in section, are shown on a larger scale in fig. 45. The triple valve, by means of which instant automatic action throughout the train is produced, consists of a piston in a short cylinder, carrying a slide valve,—the piston and the valve moving together. A vehicle out of order can be cut out of the system by turning a tap, and brakes which have been applied by the parting of a train can be released by opening a valve on the cylinder.

In 1874 a royal commission on railway accidents was appointed, and in June 1875 brake trials were made at Newark. On a level road a train, weighing 2086־ tons, running at a speed of 511 miles per hour, and fitted with the Westinghouse automatic pressure-brake—there tested for the first time on an English railway—was brought to a stand in a distance of 825 feet in the course of 18 seconds,—the equivalent distance for an initial speed of 50 miles per hour being 777 feet. In trials on the North-Eastern Kailway in July 1879, a train, fitted with the Westinghouse brake, weighing 208 tons, and running at a speed of 51 miles per hour, was stopped in a distance of 621 feet in 14f seconds,—the equivalent distance for a speed of 50 miles per hour being 594 feet. In August 1877 the Board of Trade urged the railway companies to united and harmonious action, and stated the requirements which in their opinion were essential in a good continuous brake: it should be— efficient in stopping trains; instantaneous in action and easily applied by engine-drivers or guards; in case of accident instantaneously self-acting; capable of being put on or taken off with facility, on the engine, tender, and eveiy vehicle of a train; regu-lai־ly used in daily working; and the materials employed easily maintained and kept in order. That a brake should be instantaneous in action is evident on considering that at a speed of 50 miles per hour a train advances through 73 J feet in a second of time. A striking example of the value of seconds under such circumstances is quoted in the Report, contrasting the working of the Westinghouse compressed-air brake and the Westinghouse vacuum-brake. The rates of speed were nearly the same,—about 52 miles per hour, or 76 feet per second. The train with the former brake ran 825 feet, whilst that with the latter ran 1533 feet. Now, it took 7 i seconds to put on the vacuum-brakes and 1^ seconds to put on the pressure-brakes. The difference, seconds, at 76 feet per second, makes a space of 475 feet traversed by the train before the brake came into action. In consequence of these steps taken by the Board of Trade all the large railway companies have now (1885) adopted continuous brakes, though some of these do not comply with the conditions of the Board of Trade. The principal question is not now that of Automatic rerms non-automatic, but of automatic pressure-brakes verms automatic vacuum-brakes. In the latter, as the name indicates, the work is done by the atmospheric pressure against the pressure of a comparative vacuum. At 31st December 1878 only 21 per cent, of the total carriage stock was fitted with brakes of some form, of which 128־ per cent, were automatic; whilst at 30th June 1884 of the total carriage stock 76 per cent, was fitted with continuous brakes, of which 58 per cent, were automatic.- It appears that there are in the United Kingdom considerably more Westinghouse automatic brakes in operation than any other single system. The same brake is very largely, used in America and on the Continent, and at the end of 1884 it had been adopted to the extent of upwards of 15,000 sets for locomotives and 78,000 for carriages.

Electricity.

The employment of electricity in the working of railways has already been referred to in the application of block-signalling to the direction of the traffic, in the working of junctions, the protection of stations and sidings, and the repetition of signals.

The first attempt to apply electric power for propulsion on railways was made by Mr R. Davidson, who in September 1842 tried on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway an electro-magnetic locomotive, running on four wheels and weighing 5 tons. A speed of 4 miles per hour was attained. Electric power was applied in 1881 by Messrs Siemens and Halske of Berlin on an electric railway, the Lichterfelde line, near Berlin; and since then they have constructed an electric line 14 miles long, from Charlottenburg to the Spandauer Bock, and a short line in Costverloren Park near Amsterdam. They also applied the system to a railway in the mines at Zankerode in Saxony. At the International Electric Exhibition in Paris (1881) an electric line was worked by Messrs Siemens Brothers which carried an average of over 13,000 passengers per week; and in September 1883 a railway of 3 feet gauge, 6 miles in length, was opened between Portrush and Bushmills in the [9:20:250]north of Ireland. The gradients are very heavy, having a slope of 1 in 35 at many parts. The curves are very quick, following the line of the road. The conductor employed consists of a third rail, weighing 19 lb to the yard, and laid close to the fence. Electricity is transmitted through the conductor, by means of steel brushes, to the Siemens motors by which the car is propelled. The dynamo-machines by which the electricity' is generated are driven by the power of a natural waterfall of 26 feet in the river Bush. Two turbines are driven by the fall of water at a speed of 225 revolutions per minute; each is capable of yielding 50 liorse-power. The electric car can run on the level at the rate of 12 miles per hour.

Several large metropolitan and other stations are lighted by electricity. At the Waterloo station of the London and South-Western Railway, for example, the new main line suburban passenger station, about If acres in area, has been lighted by the Anglo-American Brush Light system since February 1881, sixteen arc - lamps of 2000 candle - power each being employed. The Windsor line station at the same terminus, about H acres in area, has been lighted by the Edison Company’s system since January 1S83 with 200 glow-lamps of 16 candle-power each. The large goods-yard on the same railway, about 18 acres in extent, at Nine Elms, has been lighted since January 1883 by fourteen arc-lamps of 4000 candle-power each. The lighting of railway trains by electricity' has been successfully effected on the Great Eastern Railway since October 1884. The power is derived from a dynamo-machine driven by' a compact rotary' engine, placed together in a small case on the top of the locomotive, and worked by steam from the boiler. Sixty electric lights are generated, each of them sufficient to light thoroughly' a compartment of a carriage, and supply light for a train of at least twelve vehicles. Trains on other lines also are lighted by electricity.

Accidents.

Accidents on railways arise from three causes,—inattention of servants, defective material either in the works or the rolling stock, and excessive sped. But the adoption of the absolute block system, with the use of interlocked points and signals and continuous brakes, has led to an absolute diminution of the number of accidents, whilst the amount of traffic has been greatly increased. In 1883 the total number of train accidents on railways in the United Kingdom, reported on to the Board of Trade, was 94 on 18,681 miles open, against 241 accidents ten years earlier on 16,082 miles open. The increased efficiency of management is strikingly brought out by Table XXXII.
[table]

During the period 1873-1883 there was therefore a material improvement not only' in the character of the way and works but also in that of the rolling stock. Accidents from entering stations at too great a speed have been augmented in number,—a result naturally arising from the greater speeds and volumes of traffic. Ten of these (for 1873 and 1883) were due to want of control of the trains, and seven others to want of continuous brakes. Collisions have been diminished to a marked extent; and nearly all of those in 1883 took place at junctions, stations, and sidings, mostly within fixed signals. Many of these collisions could have been obviated if proper interlocking and block working had been in use, together with continuous brakes on the trains. Of the 94 investigated train accidents 75 took place on the lines of fifteen companies, working in the aggregate 12,850 miles, and having run upwards of 216 millions of miles with trains,—showing that one accident happened for every 171 miles of railway, or for every 3 millions nearly of miles run. One person in every 625 employed in the traffic—locomotive, carnage, engineers’, and stores departments— in 1883 was killed in the sendee. The employes who stand at the extremes of the scale of fatality are guards: of brakesmen and goods-guards 1 in 97 lost their lives, and of passenger-guards only 1 in 5902. Pointsmen and signalmen occupy a medium position in the scale, 1 in 800 losing their lives; of engine-drivers 1 in 643 was killed, and of firemen 1 in 533. Of persons other than pass engers or servants of railway companies who suffered in accidents, trespassers, including suicides, as usual form the largest number, —354 killed and 165 injured. Of passengers 125 were killed and 1416 were injured—together, 1541 persons, or 1 in about 444,000 of the total number of passengers in 18S3.

Railway Law.

Parliament soon began to exercise control over railways by' means ’ of standing orders; and in 1832 a passenger duty of |d. per mile 1 for every' four passengers carried was levied on railway companies.! In 1842 a Government department was instituted whereby the Board of Trade was empowered to appoint inspectors of railways, to postpone the opening of railway's, to disallow by r e-laws, and to institute legal proceedings against companies for infringing the law. The Board of Trade was further empowered to direct companies to make returns of accidents, of traffic, and of tolls levied. The passenger duty was fixed at 5 per cent, of the gross receipts from passengers. In 1846 the Commissioners of Railways, five in number, were appointed, to whom the jurisdiction of the Board of Trade was transferred, but in 1851 it was re-transferred to the Board of Trade. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, requires railway companies to provide “reasonable facilities” for receiving, forwarding, and delivering their own traffic and the traffic of other companies, and to abstain from “unreasonable” preference. It appears to have been of small practical utility until 1873. The Regulation of Railway's Act, 1873, establishes a new tribunal, “The Railway Commissioners,” not more than three in number, one to be of experience in the law and one of experience in railway business. The principal duty of the commissioners is to enforce the observance of the “reasonable facilities” section of the Act of 1854. The commissioners have power to enjoin the forwarding of through traffic at through rates, the power being set in motion by the companies only. The commissioners are empowered whenever there is a dispute between two companies that can be referred to arbitration to decide such dispute. The Employers’ Liability Act, 1880, provides that where personal injury is caused to a workman by' reason of the negligence of any' person in the service of the employer, who has the charge or control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train upon a railway', he or his representatives shall have the same right of compensation or remedy against the employer as if the workman had not been in the service of the employer nor engaged in his work. The amount of compensation is not to exceed three years’ earnings of the workman. (D. K. C.)

Foreign and Continental. Europe .—A few unimportant tramways were opened in France in 1826-32. In 1833 the Government began a comprehensive system of surveys, and laid down the general plan of railway' development for the whole country; and in 1842 Thiers devised a scheme by' which the state was to furnish half the cost (about £10,000 per mile), while private companies were to lay the lines at their own expense and equip and work them for a term of years. In 1857 six great companies were working their lines with profit; but the state found it necessary (1859) to guarantee them the interest on the additional lines which were needed. By subsequent legislation the construction of local railways on a cheaper scale was encouraged, and in 1875-76 unsuccessful efforts were made by speculators to unite these local lines into systems which should compete with the old companies and break their monopoly 7 . Since that date some have been absorbed by 7 the great companies; others have passed into the hands of the state. After more than one scheme for a comprehensive system of state railways had been formed by leading statesmen and then for one reason or another abandoned, in 1884 agreements were made by 7 which some 7000 miles of railway were to be constructed in addition to the 17,000 miles then in operation, the money to be supplied by the six great companies and ultimately repaid by the state, which meanwhile guaranteed the shareholders of each company 7 a dividend equal to the average of recent years (in no case so low as 7 per cent.). The profitable system of monopoly has not been favourable to the development of enterprise in railway management in France. Scarcely any 7 of the so-called express trains run at as high a speed as 40 miles an hour. The time allowed for the despatch of goods is very long. The average rates (078־d. per passenger-mile, 082׳d. per ton-mile) are somewhat higher than those of Germany 7 . The long-distance traffic especially has received but little encouragement. On the other hand, many of the technical arrangements of the French lines are excellent. Although the state owns so few railroads, it has reserved extensive rights of regulation, both in matters of business and in engineering; there is a body of Government engineers organized with almost military precision.

Soon after 1830 plans were laid for a Belgian system to be owned and managed by the state, and work was actively begun in 1833. The Government lines were arranged in the form of a cross, the point of intersection being at Malines. By this means the Government was able to develop the traffic of Belgium itself, and at the same time to secure a large share of the transit trade between Ger[9:20:251]many and England which had formerly gone via Holland. Having obtained control of the main lines with a length of about 300 miles the Government left the rest to private enterprise. Between 1850 aud 1870 the private lines had increased from less than 200 to 1400 miles and competition between the state and private railways soon became active, and for ten years after 1856 rates were in consequence reduced to the lowest possible point. The state railways, however, had certain advantages: they had been well laid out and economically constructed; their organization was admirable and the very keenness of private competition was sufficient to guard against serious abuses. Nevertheless about 1870 the Government decided to purchase most of the competing lines, and by 1874 it owned more than half the railways of the country. It now (1885) owns three-quarters; there is only one large private system which could by any possibility compete, and with this there is a joint-purse agreement. The charges in general have not been raised as a result of the new policy, and they are still the lowest in Europe.

The first lines in Holland were constructed by private companies in 1840-56. In 1860 a state system was begun, which included at one time nearly two-thirds of the mileage of the kingdom. It was not, however, managed by the state directly, but leased to a private company. But the financial results were not satisfactory to either party, and the commission of 1881-82 reported strongly against the arrangement. The absence of connexions or of mutual accommodation between the different systems elicited severe criticism.

. The first German line was opened in 1835. While most of the states were too small to have a comprehensive ·policy, Prussia from the very outset encouraged railway development, giving pecuniary assistance, and in return reserving important rights of state control. About 1848 the Government began to construct railways of its own, at the same time purchasing shares of stock in private companies. After 1870 the same policy, which had been for a time suspended, was again pushed forward in the direction of creating a German imperial system; but the jealousy of the smaller states proved fatal to its success. The Prussian Government, however, began to extend its own system on a large scale. In 1878 it owned only 3000 miles of railroad and managed 2000 more, while 6000 were in the hands of private companies. Now (1885) there are 13,000 miles of state railways and only about 1000 in private hands. The prices paid by the Government were, as a rule, high (in one instance the sellers secured an income of more than 16 per cent.), but the lines are nevertheless managed with reasonable profit to the state. The passenger-train service is prompt and comfortable. The speed attained is greater than elsewhere in Continental Europe, the maximum being about 45 miles. The passenger rates are low, averaging not quite 07־d. per mile for all passengers carried. There are comparatively few accidents. The freight service is rather slow, and the charges are not relatively so low as those for passengers. On the other hand, they have for the most part avoided preferential rates; something very like a system of equal mileage rates prevails, though not always quite consistently carried out. In addition to this rate there is a fixed terminal or “Grundsatz but it is put, almost purposely, too low, so as not to interfere with the very short-distance traffic. The result is that the mileage rate is relatively too high, and for the long-distance traffic it reaches a very high figure. Down to 1880 this result was evaded by a system of special tariffs for export, import, or transit traffic, but during the last five years a strong effort has been made to do away with them. It has not been altogether successful, owing to the competition of water-routes.

In Austria a tramway line for general traffic was chartered in 1824 ·.and opened in 1828. But until 1838 the Government positively discouraged the introduction of railways. The policy then adopted, however, guaranteed to each railway a monopoly in its own district during the (comparatively short) period for which its charter was to run. At the same time the state made lines of its own on a large scale. The revolution of 1848 led to financial straits; and in the years following most of the state railways, at least in Austria itself, were sold to private companies for about one-half their real value. But in Hungary the reality of a state railway system was more steadily maintained. The growth of the Austrian system was slow until after the war of 1866; then it began to develop rapidly. The railway speculation which ended in the crisis of 1873, being perhaps more recklessly carried on in Austria than anywhere else in the world, resulted in very severe distress. Since 1876 there have been consistent efforts to increase the importance of the state railway system both by the purchase of old lines and the construction of new ones. At present there are in Austria 2000 miles of state-managed railroad, and not quite 6000 managed by private companies; while in Hungary there are 2000 miles of state railroad and 3000 in private hands. The policy of the state management has been to reduce rates, especially for passengers; but they are still higher than in Germany. In 1883 the average receipt per mile for each passenger was 084־d.; while the average receipt per ton of freight was 1 · 09d. Per train-mile the receipts were about 9s.; but the traffic was so light in many parts of the country that the average profit on the investment was only 4f per cent.

The Austrian railways belong to the German Yerein, and are like the German lines in most of their methods and principles of administration. They have carried the system of traffic agreements, even between the state and private companies, into the same detail; but they have not adopted the system of equal mileage rates in their tariffs; on the contrary, they have (like Belgium) adopted a sliding scale, diminishing for longer distances. Probably no other country is so situated that it has to deal with such perplexing problems of railway tariff policy as Austria. Nearly all the Austrian railways are of standard gauge; but the problem of the economical construction and management of local lines has received most careful attention from the authorities; and the law specially encourages the construction of cheap railways in mountainous districts or for purely local traffic. About fifty such railways were chartered between 1880 and 1883.

The first lines in Switzerland were merely local, and the summer passenger traffic formed a main source of income. It was not until Austria had completed two routes across the Alps and France one that the first Swiss route, the St Gotthard, was projected. It is, however, the greatest work of them all, the main tunnel being over 9j miles in length. In spite of the character of the country, the Swiss railways ai’e nearly all of standard gauge. They are entirely owned by private companies, though many of them have received aid from the cantons. The rates for freight are somewhat high. There are now about 2000 miles in all.

After 1860 the railways of Italy developed rapidly. There were four main systems—the upper Italian, the Roman, the Calabrian, and the southern system (along the Adriatic). Although this last had in many respects the least promising field, it was the most enterprising and the most successful. The other systems had been arranged more in accordance with the old political divisions than in accordance with the wants of trade. In spite of liberal subsidies from the Government they did not prosper. The lines of Calabria (and Sicily) were the most unfortunate; and the Government in 1870 was compelled to take the railways of this section into its own hands. The gross receipts have been constantly less than the working expenses. In 1873 the Government contracted to purchase the Roman railways for the same general reasons. The financial difficulties were such that the contract was not carried out till 1880-82. Meantime similar contracts, though for very different reasons, had been made for the purchase of the other two systems. But a special commission, which thoroughly studied the question during 1878-81, reported that the Italian Government had better not undertake to work its lines, even though it virtually owned them. Eventually they were leased for a term of sixty years to two main companies, each controlling about 3000 miles of line, with a third, much smaller, in Sicily. The state is to receive about 27^ per cent, of the gross receipts, the companies 62| per cent.; the remainder is to be divided in a somewhat complicated system of reserve funds. On the whole, the railways of Italy leave much to be desired both in construction and equipment. The rates are reasonable, particularly for local traffic; but the service is always slow, and often quite inadequate to the wants of trade.

The first railway line in Spain was opened in 1848, and the period of most rapid development was from 1855 to 1865. The Government encouraged railways by most liberal subsidies, which had the effect of bringing forward a number of purely speculative undertakings. The indirect results were bad; and for this, as well as other reasons, the years 1869-75 formed a time of most serious depression. Since then matters have improved greatly, on account both of changes in legislation made about 1870 and of the improvement in the country itself. There are now about 5000 miles of railway. One-fourth of the money spent has been advanced by the Government; and of late years the financial results have been reasonably good. The ratio of working expenses to gross earnings is about 45 per cent. Tire charges for passengers are rather low; but those for freight are extremely high. The gauge is 5| feet.

The first Portuguese line was constructed by the state in 1853 or 1854. The Government now owns about half the roads of the country,—one system in the north and another in the south, each somewhat less than 200 miles long. The central lines are owned by a company, chartered in 1859, which has been for many years managed by a body of French directors, from whose control it has but recently been freed. The financial results have been far from satisfactory. The railways are built on a 5| feet gauge.

In Denmark and in Norway railway development has been slow. The greater part of the lines are owned and managed by Government. Most of the Norwegian lines are laid on a gauge of 3 h feet. The running is slow and the traffic very light. Sweden possesses something over 4000 miles in all, of which the state owns about one-third. The capital averages less than £7000 per mile,—lower than in almost any other country of the world. The railways are in the hands of a number of local companies, which control on an average hardly 30 miles each.

In Russia a short railway—little more than an experiment—was constructed in the neighbourhood of St Petersburg in 1835-37. The first line of any length was opened in 1851 between St Peters [9:20:252]burg and Moscow. This was built by the state, but afterwards sold to a private company. After the close of the Crimean War railway construction was more rapid. The lines were laid down by the Government surveyors, but were constructed and managed by private companies, receiving, however, much help from the Government. Of the 15,000 miles in operation hardly a tenth part belongs to the state, even including the 700 miles of state railway in Finland. Yet about half the capital employed in railway construction has been furnished by the state. Since 1880 the construction of railways in European Russia has moved slowly. Of greater importance has been the development of the Asiatic lines. The first of these, in the Caucasus, was opened in 1872 to a length of nearly 200 miles. The Trans-Caspian military railway was begun in 1880; the connexion between the Caspian and the Black Sea was completed in 1883. The Siberian railway is being pushed forward as rapidly as the finances of the empire will allow. The administration is in most respects modelled upon that adopted by Germany and Austria. The plan of the Russian railways has been dictated by military rather than industrial considerations. The gauge is 5 feet.

Isolated lines were constructed in Turkey in 1860 and 1866. The first general plan for a system of importance dates from 1869, and was modified in 1872. Foreign companies furnished the capital and received a subsidy from the Government. In return they were to make certain annual payments; but the clauses providing for this were so carelessly drawn that the companies seem to have had an interest in delaying the completion of the work. Some of the lines were lost in the cession of territory which followed the war of 1878. There are now open for traffic about 1000 miles of railway in European Turkey, and 200 more in Asia Minor.

There is a fairly developed system of railways (1000 miles or more) in Roumania, owned by the state; and there are a few lines in Servia. Arrangements seem to be completed by which through communication in these countries will soon be established on a large scale, if the authorities in Turkey and Bulgaria do not fail in their duty. The Government of Greece is also engaged in extending its railway system, which has hitherto amounted to nothing. (A. T. II.)

America .—In the Dominion of Canada 9113 miles of railway and 6735 of tramway, together 15,848, were open in the end of 1883. The accounts show that the total outlay for construction amounted to about 73 millions sterling, being at the rate of £4610 per mile. The gross earnings for the year 1883 amounted to upwards of 6 millions sterling, of which 723־ per cent, was absorbed as working expenses, leaving £1,693,000 net earnings, which amounted to only 23־ per cent, on the capital cost. The earlier railways were laid to gauges of 5£ and 3£ feet, but the inconveniences of break of gauge with the railways of the United States led to the relaying of all the lines to the standard gauge, except those of Newfoundland and Prince Edward’s Island, which remain on the 3.) feet gauge. The principal system is the Grand Trunk Railway, comprising the original Grand Trunk and the Great Western, which were consolidated in 1882, making a total length of 2358 miles of line. The first section of the system—Portland to Montreal—was opened in 1853, the first line opened in Canada. In June 1884 of the (estimated) 2899 miles of the Canadian Pacific Railway, connecting the Pacific with the Atlantic, 2105 miles were open and in operation.

In Mexico the first railway constructed and opened was the Mexican Railway, between Mexico city and Vera Cruz, 264 miles, with a branch 29 miles, the first section from Vera Cruz to Paso del Macho being opened in 1865. This railway, with one or more others in Mexico, was constructed to the 4 feet 8^ inch gauge, but others, including the Mexican National Railway, 910 miles long, are laid to the 3 feet gauge. The Mexican Central Railroad, 1224 miles long, was completed in 1884.

The Panama Railroad, Colombia, between Aspinwall and Panama, 47£ miles in length, was opened in January 1855. The rails are laid to a gauge of 5 feet. Railways were in progress in 1883-84 in several of the other states of Colombia, all of them to a gauge of 3 feet.

In Guatemala the first line of railway from San José to Esquintla, 13 miles in length, laid to a gauge of 3 feet, was opened in June 1880. A line from Champerico to Ritalhulca, 30 miles long, was opened in December 1883; and another from San José to the capital, 69 miles long, is now finished.

In the empire of Brazil the Manâ Railway was the first line opened, early in the decade 1850-60. It is a short line of single way, 11 miles long, between the head of the bay of Rio de Janeiro anti the foot of the serra. It was laid to a gauge of 5£ feet; but other lines in Brazil are laid to a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The empire possessed in January 1884 railways of a total length of 3500 miles open for traffic, besides 1500 miles in course of construction. The state owns nine lines, having 1300 miles open, the principal of which is the Dom Pedro II., intended to connect the eastern and western provinces of the empire.

Chili was one of the first states in South America to initiate the construction of railways. The Copiapo Railway, laid to the 4 feet 8| inch gauge, was opened about 1850; and an Act was passed in 1852 authorizing the construction of a line to connect Santiago with Valparaiso, 114 miles distant. In 1855 the first 8 miles were opened for traffic, and in 1863 the line was opened throughout. It was constructed to a gauge of 5| feet. In 1883 the total length of lines open for traffic was 1378 miles.

In Peru a system of railways has been in course of construction 1 since 1852, chiefly at the expense of the state. In 1878 there were open for traffic, or in course of construction, twenty-two lines belonging to the state and to private individuals, 2030 miles in length, representing a cost of about 36 millions sterling.

Africa .—The railways of Lower Egypt have been laid out pri-1 marily to connect Alexandria, Cairo, and Suez, with branches to Mansurali and elsewhere in the Delta. The line first laid out, between Alexandria and Cairo, 130 miles long, was opened in January 1856. The junction line from Bennah to Suez is 101f miles in length; the total length of railways open for traffic in Egypt at the end of 1883 was 941 miles, laid to the 4 feet 84 inch gauge.

There are three systems of railway at the Cape of Good Hope,— < the Western from Cape Town, the Midland from Port Elizabeth, 1 and the Eastern from East London. In January 1884 there were 1213 miles open for traffic.

In the colony of Natal there were at the end of 1883 105 miles of railway open, and 120 were then in course of construction.

In the Island of Mauritius there are two lines of railway laid to the 4 feet 8¿ inch gauge, with two branches, of a total length of 94 miles. The North line, starting from Port Louis, is 31 miles long, and was opened in 1864; the Midland line, passing through the centre of the island, is 35 miles long, and was opened in 1865.

Asia .—In 1845 the East Indian and the Great Indian Peninsula Railway Companies were formed. Four years later the Government entered into arrangements with these two companies for the construction of railways in the presidencies of Bengal and Bombay, guaranteeing for ninety-nine years a dividend of from to 5 per cent, upon the estimated cost of these and succeeding railways. They adopted one uniform gauge of 5 feet 6 inches. Down to 1869 this policy of guarantee and uniform gauge was adhered to. But in 1869, under the rule of Lord Lawrence, the Government altered the standard gauge for new lines to one metre, or 3 feet 3§ inches, and used the lightest rails and rolling-stock compatible with the requirements of Indian traffic. There are now five different railway gauges in India, namely, the 5J feet, the 3 feet 3§ inch, the 4 feet, the 2£ feet, and the 2 feet. The first piece of railway opened in India was a section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, 20§ miles long, from Bombay to Tannah, in 1853. At the end of March 1884 there were 1288 miles of that railway open for traffic. The East Indian Railway was opened for a length of 38 miles in 1854; there are now 1509 miles open. In 1869 this railway was transferred to Government, though it is still worked by the company. Of the Madras Railway 65 miles were opened in 1856; there are now 861 open. The first of the imperial state railways was opened (114 miles) in 1873. At the end of March 1884 the number of miles of line open for traffic was as follows (Table XXXIII.):—
[table]

The number of passengers carried increased from 24,280,459 in 1874 to 65,098,953 in 1883.

In Ceylon the railways have been constructed by the Govern-ment. The main line, from Colombo to Kandy, 74.1 miles long, was opened for traffic in 1867; and the branch to Navalapitiya, 17 miles long, was opened in 1874. The Kalutara Railway, 27| miles long, was finally opened in 1879. There were 164 miles open at the end of 1884, and 16 in course of construction.

The only railway ever laid in China ran along a strip of land, about 9 miles long, between Shanghai and Woosung, opened in 1876. In October 1877 the line was removed and the traffic came to an end in consequence of official jealousy, although the railway was very popular with the natives.

The first railway that was opened in Japan was the Tokio-Yoko-liama line, 18 miles in length, commenced in 1869 and opened for traffic in 1872, laid to a gauge of 3£ feet. At June 1884 there were open for traffic 236 miles of railway.

Australia .—The four leading colonies of Australia have their capitals connected by railways, and each has its own gauge.

The railways of New South Wales are divided into three systems, all of which take their departure from Sydney, the capital,—the northern, the western, and the southern system. The first piece of line, 15 miles in length, was opened in 1855; and at the end of 1883 there were 1320 miles open for traffic, and 597 in course of [9:20:253]construction. The lines are laid to a uniform gauge of 4 feet 8J inches.

i Victoria has a uniform gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The railways all belong to the state. There were 1562 miles of railway open at the end of 1883, besides which 130 were in progress.

i In Queensland a system of light substantial railways has been laid out on the feet gauge, mainly from motives of economy and to moderate the difficulties of carrying the line over the main range to the tableland of the Darling Downs. The first section of the Southern and Western Railway was opened in 1867. At the end of 1883 there were 1038 miles of railway open for traffic, and 454 were in course of construction.

In South Australia a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches was at first adopted. The Adelaide and Port Adelaide Railway, miles long, was opened in 1856, and the Adelaide and Kapunda Railway, connecting the capital with the chief copper mines, 50¿ miles long, was opened in 1857. At the same time railways on a 3J feet gauge were also constructed; the first of these, between Port Wakefield and Blyth, was partly opened in May 1867. The Port Augusta and Port Darwin Railway, destined to connect the Indian Ocean with the Southern Ocean, will, when completed, be about 2000 miles in length. The colony had 991 miles of railway open for traffic at the end of 1883, with 225 in course of construction. In view of the inconveniences of a break of gauge, the progress of the broader gauge lines was stayed northwards, after the junctions had been effected, and new main lines into the interior are constructed on the 3| feet gauge.

In Western Australia there were only 55 miles of railway open for traffic at the end of 1883 and 68 in course of construction.

At the end of 1883 Tasmania had 167 miles of railway completed, and in 1884 207 miles in course of construction.

New Zealand .—The first railways in New Zealand were constructed in the province of Canterbury: the Lyttelton and Christchurch Railway, connecting the port town with the capital of the province, 6 miles long, was commenced in 1860, and opened in 1867, laid to a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The Great Southern Railway, a portion of the trunk line to the south, of the same gauge, was opened, also in 1867, to the river Selwyn, distant 23 miles from Christchurch. A comprehensive system of railways connecting the chief towns of the colony was commenced at the expense of the Government in 1872, for which the 3^ feet gauge was adopted as the standard. The first lines so constructed were the Wellington and Woodville Railway and the Napier and Manawatu Railway. At the end of 1883 there were 469 miles open for traffic in the North Island and 926 in the South Island, besides 91 of private lines, making in all 1486 miles. (D. K. C.)

United States. Construction .—The low cost of American railways has been due largely to a close adaptation of the alignment to the natural surface by the use of grades and curves. The importance of saving in materials, labour, and cost has been very much greater than in Europe, because labour and nearly all materials but timber were much costlier, and especially because the interest on money was very much higher,—until about 1875, on the average probably 9 or 10 per cent. The use of the “truck” or “bogie” under locomotives and cars made it possible for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the first long line in a mountainous country, to be constructed with curves of 600 feet radius, and on temporary lines on the same railway with curves of 300 and 278 feet radius. Curves of 955 and even 716 feet radius are common through difficult country; curves of 573 feet radius occur on some important lines; and 410 to 383 feet radii are not uncommon in mountainous regions. On the United States military railroads in 1864 an immense traffic passed safely over temporary lines with a curve of 50 feet radius. Early experiments as to the real power of the locomotive to surmount gradients led to the adoption of 110 and 116 feet per mile for ascents 17 miles long, and to the successful use on a temporary track over a tunnel (in 1852) of gradients of 1 in 10, over which a locomotive weighing 25 tons hauled regularly one-car trains weighing 53^ tons, including its own weight. A gradient of 1 in 127 miles long, in a mining branch in Colorado is now regularly worked. In the construction proper a noticeable peculiarity has been the free use of open trestle-work of timber, to save both masonry and earth or rock excavation. Some of these timber structures have been of enormous proportions, as the Portage Viaduct (see vol. iv. p. 328) over the Genesee River, 234 feet high and 800 feet long, in 50 feet spans, built in eighteen months (1858), at a cost of only $140,000, and containing 125,000 cubic feet of timber and 80 tons of bolts. Structures of timber exceeding 100 feet in height have been rare, but of all dimensions below that exceedingly common, the usual intent and practice having been to replace them as they became unserviceable with masonry embankments. Although their use has not unfrequently been abused by permitting them to become unsafe from decay, they have in the main been thoroughly solid and substantial. For bridge spans of 30 to 250 feet the wooden “Howe truss” bridge, a type peculiar to America, was early invented and almost universally used where wrought-iron trusses would be now used both in Europe and America. The piers and abutments for such trusses were usually of stone, but not unfrequently of timber also. These wooden trusses are now being rapidly replaced with iron,-the lead-ing types being the Whipple, Post, Fink, and Bollman trusses (see Bridges, vol. iv. p. 322 sq.). The sleepers (in America called ties or cross-ties) are usually of hard wood (white oak), hewn on top and bottom, with the natural surface of the tree on the sides. The usual dimensions are 6 (sometimes 7) inches thick, 8 (sometimes 8| or 9) feet long, and 8 to 10 or even 12 inches face. The usual rule is to place them 2 feet or less apart, and 2640 to 2700 to the mile. The large bearing surface thus afforded has especially favoured the use of the flat-based or Vignoles rail, and it is in exclusive use throughout North and for the most part South America. The rails now most largely rolled weigh from 56 to 65 lb per yard. On the light-traffic lines of the south and west there are still many 50 lb rails, and in the north and east rails of 70, 72, 75, and 80 tb sections are in limited but increasing use. An average for the whole United States would now be somewhat under 60 lb. The close propinquity of the sleepers gives much greater stiffness to the rail than comparative weights alone would indicate, a 60 lb rail being fully equivalent in stiffness and strength to an 80 lb rail supported on chairs 3 feet between centres. The ballast and drainage of American railroads have often been very defective, with the view to effecting a large saving in first cost. Improvements in this as in other respects have taken place in recent years, and many thousand miles are now maintained at a high standard of excellence. Right of way, usually in a continuous strip 100 feet wide (wider where necessary, but never narrower), has been largely given, or purchased at veiy low rates. The widths of road-bed (almost always first graded for a single track) are usually 18 to 20 feet in excavation and 14 feet on embankments, with 1| to 1 slopes. Side slopes of 1 to 1 have been largely used in regions not exposed to frost. Parallel tracks are placed 13 feet between centres.

Railway development in the United States has had to adapt itself to the needs of a new and rapidly growing country, a large part of which was first made available for settlement by railways. Three locomotives were imported from England in 1829, and the first trial in America took place on 8th August 1829 at Honesdale, Pennsylvania. The first railway constructed to be worked by locomotives was the South Carolina Railroad (1828-30), though trials of an experimental locomotive had been made before on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which continued to be worked by horse power until 1832. The mileage of railway construction about kept pace with that of the United Kingdom until 1850; at the beginning of 1885 it amounted to 125,379 miles. The mileage completed amounted to 40 miles at the end of 1830, to 3361 miles in 1841, and to 5206 miles in 1847, of which 1340 miles had been opened within six years. Then there was a sudden and great increase, the yearly additions for seven years being 1056 miles in 1848, 1048 in 1849, 1261 in 1850, 1274 in 1851, 2288 in 1852, 2170 in 1853, 3442 miles in 1854. The Civil War checked railway construction, only 3257 miles being opened during the five years ending with 1865, when the aggregate amounted to 32,996 miles. But during the seven years ending with 1872 the mileage of the country was nearly doubled, the yearly additions being 1403 miles in 1866, 2541 in 1867, 2468 in 1868, 4103 in 1869, 5658 in 1870, 6660 in 1871, 7439 in 1872, a total of 30,272 miles in seven years. At the close of this period of construction there was a mile of railway to every 666 inhabitants. It was followed by great financial disasters and industrial stagnation, and by a period of comparative inactivity in railway extension, only 5217 miles being opened in 1873, and only 14,057 in the five years ending with 1878 (2428 in the last-named year). During the five years ending with 1883 40,000 miles were opened, of which 11,568 fell to 1882. At the end of 1884 the population per mile of railway w r as 458. There was no railway west of the Mississippi until 1853, and then only 38 miles; in 1860 there were 1930 miles (24,990 on the east), and in 1865 3007 miles. (29,988 on the east). Since 1865 46,600 miles have been built west of the Mississippi. About one-half of the population of the United States is in the territory lying north of the Potomac and Ohio and east of the Mississippi, including sixteen States with an aggregate area of 418,495 square miles, 29,000,000 inhabitants, and 55,725 miles of railway. France and Germany together have nearly the same area (416,205 square miles), 83,000,000 inhabitants, and 40,682 miles of railway. The United States has one mile of railway to 75־ square miles of territory and 520 inhabitants, aml Europe 1 mile of railway to 102־ square miles and 2040 inhabitants. The two States of New York and Pennsylvania, whose area is about equal to that of Great Britain, have one mile of railway to 62־ square miles, against one to 59־ in Great Britain; and Massachusetts and New Jersey, with one-third more area than Belgium (which has more railway in proportion to area than any other European country), have 4 square miles of area per mile of railway, while Belgium has 42־. In the Southern States the railways are much less numerous and have lighter traffic and earnings. The prevailing course of traffic in America is east and west, or rather [9:20:254]to and from the north-eastern Atlantic States north of the Potomac. The eastern “trunk lines,” as they are called, extending from the west to the north-eastern seaports (and also to Canada), have a heavier goods traffic than any other lines of considerable length in the world. The companies owning these lines also own or control in some way extensive systems reaching as far west as Chicago, and in several cases to the Mississippi at St Louis. Two great systems centre on the Pacific coast. Chicago is the chief traffic centre of the interior.

The railways having at first to serve a thinly peopled but rapidly growing country, American engineers devised methods of construction and working which produced a line at very small cost, lacking very many of the appliances considered necessary in Europe, but capable of being extended and developed as the country itself became more settled and prosperous. At first many Unes cost only £2000 per mile, and much better lines are now being built for £3000 per mile or less. Even when fully developed they are still usually very much less costly than European railways. Some of the large systems have cost, on the average, only from £7000 to £3000 per mile. The average reported cost in 1884 of the 125,000 miles of railway in the United States was £11,400 per mile; but the actual average cost is probably much less.

In the United States coal for fuel and timber for building and other purposes are carried by railway 1500 miles or more from the place of production. Cattle are carried 2000 miles and more, and wheat and other grains worth but half as much per ton, in immense quantities, 1500 to 1800 miles. This is possible only by rates which in most countries would be thought ruinously low. But in recently settled parts of the United States the population are often dependent upon the railway for almost everything they consume; and almost everything they produce, except their bread and meat, has to be carried by the same means. Thus the traffic per inhabitant is very much larger than in most old countries. Hence too manufactured goods can often be carried 1000 or 1500 miles at a cost very little more than that at the place of manufacture or importation. In one year the five eastern trunk lines received at their western termini (about 450 miles from New York) for transportation eastwards 8,200,000 tons of goods, equal to more than 26,000 tons daily. This has greatly promoted the formation of large railway systems and the construction of branches and extensions by railway companies near unsettled districts. A company with a line 500 miles long is induced to make extensions not only by the profit to be made on the new line, which in a new country may be almost nothing for several years, but also by the profit made by carrying the traffic of the new line over the 500 miles of old railway. Comparing the traffic per inhabitant in the United States, Germany, and Austria-Hungary in 1883, we get (Table XXXIV.)
[table]

Thus each American travels three-fifths more and has 3½ times as much goods transportation done for him as the average German.

The railways of America have enjoyed great liberty in fixing their rates, which, however, have been somewhat restricted by new legislation in several States since 1870, notably one limiting the New York Central to 2 cents (1d.) per mile for all classes of passengers. The average rates for goods have been reduced very much since the Civil War and even since 1875. Passenger rates have also been reduced, but not nearly so much. Table XXXV. shows, in pence, the average goods rates per ton on a few important railways :—
[table]

From the whole country the averages in 1884 were—rate per mile, 0 - 629d.; per ton of goods, 0∙502d.; per passenger, 1∙178d. This on the average goods rate from 1880 to 1884 was a reduction of 13 per cent., amounting to more than £13,000,000 on the traffic of 1884. The passenger rates of the above-named railways have been in pence per mile (Table XXXVI.) :—
[table]

The classification of passengers is but little developed in America. For local journeys there are usually but one class and one rate of fare; but on several important lines additional charges are made for certain special kinds of accommodation. Railway “wars” often bring down the through fares to a ridiculously low figure: for instance, the first-class fare for 960 miles, New York to Chicago, has been £2 or less, and the immigrant fare during the spring and summer of 1884 was 4s. The rates on goods are innumerable and are often changed. Table XXXVII. gives examples of the great fluctuations in these rates, the figures being the number of cents per 100 lb of first-class (the highest class) freight :—
[table]

The rates which the railways have endeavoured to maintain on this traffic since 1877 have been, with but slight changes, 75 cents for first-class freight, 60 for second, 45 for third, 35 for fourth, and 25 cents for fifth. The highest of these is at the rate of 1∙644 cents per American ton per mile ( = 0∙92d. per English ton per mile); the lowest is 0∙548 cent ( = 0 - 307d.) The “basis rate” is that on grain and flour from Chicago to New York,—grain, flour, and meats forming about four-fifths of the whole traffic eastwards. Twenty cents ( = 0∙492 cent or 0 - 275d. per ton per mile) is considered a remunerative rate. Another “basis rate” is that from Chicago south-west to Kansas City, which governs rates from places about 500 miles from Chicago west and south-west. This rate is usually nearly the same as that from Chicago north-west to St Paul, 400 miles, governing a large amount of traffic in that direction. Between the Missouri river and the Pacific coast is another territory with another basis; and in the south, rates from the Atlantic ports to inland towns are governed by one general rule, as also those from places in the upper Mississippi valley (like St Louis, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Louisville) to the same or other interior towns of the south. Traffic is facilitated on the longer routes by organizations known as “fast freight lines,” whose cars run over several connecting railways. When first established these lines were independent corporations, owning their cars, collecting the charges for transportation, and paying dividends out of their profits. Nowall but a few are simply co-operative agencies of the several associated railway companies, which contribute cars in certain agreed proportions, and share the expenses of the joint agencies, each company receiving the earnings for the freight passing over its railway precisely as for any through freight.

The laws governing the formation of railway corporations and authorizing railway construction differ in different States, but in most it is open to any association of men with the necessary capital to form a company and construct a railway anywhere. Generally the laws relating to raising and extending capital and the disposition of income are very lax, and under them great abuses have occurred. All but a very small number of the railways have been projected and constructed by private enterprise; but many companies have received aid from towns, cities, counties, or States, and the Federal Government and the State of Texas (the only State owning the public land within its borders) have subsidized many railways, mostly west of the Mississippi, by immense grants of public lands, in the aggregate amounting to 200,000,000 acres. The' Federal Government also lent its bonds to the amount of £13,000,000 to aid in the construction of a few lines between the Missouri and the Pacific coast. Between 1830 and 1840 several States undertook to construct railways on their own account; but most of these attempts ended in disaster, and the railways were completed by companies, if completed at all. There remain, however, two State railways, one 138 miles long owned by Georgia, which it leases to a corporation for working, and the other by Massachusetts, mostly in the long Hoosac tunnel. Owing to the pernicious system of raising capital for railway construction from the sale of bonds, secured only by the property bought by the proceeds, before the end of 1874 108 railway companies were insolvent, and interest was unpaid on more than £100,000,000 ($497,807,660) of mortgage bonds which they had issued. Indeed, of the total nominal railway capital of the United States very nearly one-half is represented by bonds. One great company which has paid dividends for many years has £9,500,000 of stock to £20,000,000 of debt. The management of railway companies in the United States is often autocratic to the last degree. When once directors have been elected by the vote of the majority of the shareholders, they take the most important steps without ever consulting the shareholders, and in their annual reports they give only such information as they please, subject to no examination by independent auditors. This state of things naturally leads to grave abuses, to directoral mismanagement and dishonest speculation in bonds and shares. In some cases, however, the authority of the directors is limited by the charter or constitution of the company.

There are very few, if any, lines which have trains whose speed equals that of the fast English trains, the fastest being between [9:20:255]New York and Philadelphia, 90 miles in 112 minutes. The 440 miles from New York to Buffalo are run in 10¾ hours, and the 960 miles from New York to Chicago in 25 hours. A great obstacle to fast running is the original vice of construction with level highway and railway crossings. Only few lines are provided with the block signals and interlocking apparatus required with numerous fast trains; but the use of continuous air-brakes is general. There has been more success in designing appliances to mitigate the effect of accidents than in inventions for avoiding them altogether. Accidents are very numerous, the casualties being more frequent in proportion to traffic than in the principal European countries. The number of accidents to passengers, however, is insignificant when compared with that of accidents to employés and persons walking over crossing-lines. In 1880 the numbers killed and injured were (Table XXXVIII.):—
[table]

This gives one passenger killed for every 43,280,000 miles travelled, and one injured to every 11,375,000. In the United Kingdom there were one passenger killed for every 960,000 miles run by passenger trains, and one injured for every 254,000 miles.

Though American railways have steeper grades and sharper curves than in Europe, the loads carried in freight trains are sometimes exceptionally large: trains of 45 or 50 eight-wheeled cars each loaded with nearly 18 tons are common. The average load on the principal lines has been doubled since 1870, largely by the adoption of heavier and more powerful locomotives and by the better management of trains, and to some extent by a better condition of permanent w τ ay. This has had much to do with the great reduction in the rates charged. The cost of working American railways is usually a larger proportion of the earnings than in Europe. An American railway which spends 60, 66⅔, or 75 per cent, of its earnings for working expenses would in England be called costly to work. The expense per ton per mile on several railways in recent years has been, in cents per ton of 2000 lb (Table XXXIX.) :—
[table]

The expense per passenger mile, which is larger than in Europe, since the traffic is nearly all first-class, is shown, in cents, in Table XL.
[table]

American railways also contrive to do their work with a very small number of men. In 1880 86,781 miles of railway were worked with a force of 418,957 men, or 4∙7 men per mile, against 367,793 in the United Kingdom on 18,681 miles, or 19∙7 per mile, and 316,570 in Germany, or 143 per mile. The greater thinness of traffic on American lines accounts for but part of this, for the number of train-miles per year per man employed in different countries is 929 in the United States, 350 in the United Kingdom, 476 in Germany, 395 in Austria-Hungary. A better measure of the work done per man is the number of passenger and ton miles for each man employed (which cannot be given for the United Kingdom); this is shown in Table XLI. :—

The principal statistics of the railways of the United States in recent years are sho - wn in Table XLII. :—
