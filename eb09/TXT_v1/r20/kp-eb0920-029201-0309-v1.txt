RATLAM or Rutlam, a native state of India, in the Western Mahva Agency (Central India Agency), lying between 23° 2' and 23° 36' N. lat. and 74° 42' and 75° 17' E. long., with an area of 729 square miles, and a population (1881) of 87,314 (males 45,779, females 41,535),— Hindus numbering 54,034, Mohammedans 9913, Jains 6038, Christians 19, and aboriginals 17,297. Its revenue from all sources in 1881-82 was estimated at ¿6130,000. The Nimach State Railway connecting Indore with Nimach and Nasirabad ¡)asses by Ratlam town. This town, which is one of the principal seats of the opium trade of Malwa, is superior to most cities in Indore, and has good bazaars. Its population in 1881 amounted to 31,066 (16,544 males and 14,522 females).

Ratlam state is held as tributary to Sindhia; but in 1819 an arrangement was made by which the raja agreed to pay an annual tribute amounting to about £6600, while Sindhia engaged never to send any troops into the country or to interfere with the internal administration. This tribute was assigned by the treaty of 1844 between the British Government and Sindhia in part payment of the Gwalior contingent. It is now paid to the British Government.
