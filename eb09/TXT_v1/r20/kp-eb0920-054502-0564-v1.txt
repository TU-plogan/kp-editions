RICHMOND a town of Surrey, is situated on the south bank of the Thames, here crossed by a stone bridge of five arches, 8∣ miles west of Hyde Park Corner by road, and 9f from the Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. The town, anciently called Syeηes and afterwards Schene and Sheen, until the name was in 1500 changed to Richmond by command of Henry VII., grew up round the royal manor house, which became a frequent residence of different sovereigns, but of which nothing more than a gateway now remains. Edward I. received the Scotch commissioners at his manor of Sheen in 1300. The palace was rebuilt by Edward III., who died there in 1377. It was frequently resided in by Richard IL, and here his wife Anne of Bohemia died, upon which he cursed the place and “caused it to be thrown down and defaced.” By Henry V. it was, however, rebuilt, and a great tournament was held at it in 1492 by Henry VII., who after its destruction by fire in 1499 restored it and named it Richmond. Henry VIII. gave it to Wolsey to reside in, after the latter presented him with the new palace of Hampton Court. James I. settled it on his son Henry, prince of Wales, who restored and embellished it at great expense. Charles I. added to it the new deer park generally known as Richmond Park, 2253 acres in extent, which is surrounded by a wall 11 miles in length. After the execution of the king, .the parliament presented the park to the citizens of London, who again presented it to Charles II. at the Restoration. Though partly dismantled, the palace was the residence of the queen dowager till 1665, and by J âmes II. it was used as a nursery for the young prince; but, gradually falling into decay, it was, about 1720, parcelled into tenements. In the old deer park extending northwards from the site of the palace towards Kew an observatory was erected in 1769, occupying the site of a Carthusian convent founded by Henry V., and a dwelling house in which Swift for some time resided. To the south-east of the town, at the entrance to Richmond Park, is Richmond Hill, from which is the famous view of the Thames with the surrounding country to the west. The White Lodge in Richmond Park is usually the residence of some member of the royal family. The town itself is without special interest, and consists chiefiy of one long and irregular street running north and south. The church of St Mary Magdalen is of considerable antiquity, but has been almost entirely rebuilt; it contains a large number of monuments to celebrated persons. The theatre, first established in 1719, was during his later years leased by Edmund Kean. The town has a Wesleyan theological college founded in 1834, a free public library, and public baths. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1210 acres) in 1871 was 15,113, and in 1881 it was 19,066.
