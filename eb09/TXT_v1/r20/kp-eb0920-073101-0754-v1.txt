ROME

PART I.—ROMAN HISTORY.

Section I.— Ancient History.

I. The Beginnings of Rome and the Monarchy.

BOTH the city and the state of Rome are represented in tradition as having been gradually formed by the fusion of separate communities. The original settlement of Romulus is said to have been limited to the Palatine Mount. With this were united before the end of his reign the Capitoline and the Quirinal; Tullus Hostilius added the Ctelian, Ancus Martius the Aventine; and finally Servius Tullius included the Esquiline and Viminal, and enclosed the whole seven hills with a stone wall. The growth of the state closely followed that of the city. To the original Romans on the Palatine were added successively the Sabine followers of King Tatius, Albans transplanted by Tullus, Latins by Ancus, and lastly the Etruscan comrades of Cseles Vibenna. This tradition is supported by other and more positive evidence. The race of the Luperci on February 15 was in fact a purification of the boundaries of the “ancient Palatine town,” ^[1. L. L.,] the “square Rome” of Ennius; ^[2.] and the course taken is that described by Tacitus as the “pomoerium” of the city founded by Romulus. ^[3. Ann., Diet. Geog., Topog. cl. Stadt Rom, Topog. u. Gesch. d. Stadt Rom,] On the Esquiline, Varrò mentions an “ancient city” and an “earthen rampart,” ^[4. L. L., cf. ibid.,] and the festival of the Septimontium is evidence of a union between this settlement and that on the Palatine. ^[5.] The fusion of these “Mounts” with a settlement on the Quirinal “Hill” is also attested by trustworthy evidence; ^[6. R. G.] and in particular the line taken by the procession of the Argei represents the enlarged boundaries of these united communities. ^[7. L. L.,] Lastly, the Servian agger still remains as a witness to the final enclosure of the various settlements within a single ring-wall. But is tradition right in representing this fusion of distinct settlements as a fusion also of communities of different race? Much of what it says on this point may be at once dismissed as fabulous. The tales of JEneas and his Trojans, of Evander and his Arcadians, of the followers of Heracles, and of the still earlier Aborigines have no claim to a place in history; ^[8.] we cannot accept the tradition to which the Romans clung with proud humility of the asylum opened by Romulus, or believe that the ancestors of the Romans were a mixed concourse of outlaws and refugees, ^[9. R. G., sq., Phil. cl. Gesch.,] nor, while admitting the probability of the tradition that in remote times the “Sicels” had dwelt on the seven hills, can we allow them any part or lot in the historic Roman people. ^[10.] That this people were in the main homogeneous and in the main of Latin descent is unquestionable. Indications of the truth are not wanting even in the traditions themselves: King

Faunus who rules the Aborigines on the Palatine 13 Latin; “Latini” is the name assumed by the united Aborigines and Trojans; the immediate progenitors of Rome are the Latin Lavinium and the Latin Alba. The evidence of the language, the religion, the institutions and civilization of early Rome points to the same conclusion. The speech of the Romans is from the first Latin ^[11.] the oldest gods of Rome—Saturn, Janus, Jupiter, Juno, Diana, &c.—are all Latin; “rex,” “praetor,” “dictator,” “curia,” are Latin titles and institutions. ^[12. Bullettino dell. Inst., Corp. I. Lat., cf. Röm. Staatsverwaltung, AEn.] Geographically too the low hills by the Tiber form a part of the strip of coast-land from which the Latini took their name, and the primitive settlements, with their earthen ramparts and wooden palisades planted upon them out of reach both of human foes and of the malaria of the swampy low grounds, are only typical of the mode of settlement which the conditions of life dictated throughout Latium. ^[13. Die Italiker in d. Poebene Anfänge Roms, Mittel-Italien, sq.] But tradition insists on the admixture of at least two non-Latin elements, a Sabine and an Etruscan. The question as regards the latter will be more fully discussed hereafter; it is enough to say here that there is no satisfactory evidence that any one of the communities which combined to form Rome was Etruscan, or that there was any important Etruscan strain in the Roman blood. ^[14. Rom. Alterth.,] With the Sabines it is otherwise. That union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements which constituted so decisive a stage in the growth of Rome is represented as having been in reality a union of the original Latins with a band of Sabine invaders who had seized and held not only the Quirinal Hill but the northern and nearest peak of the Capitoline Mount. The tradition was evidently deeply rooted. The name of the Quirinal Hill itself was derived from the Sabine town of Cures. ^[15. L. L.,] The ancient worships connected with it were said to be Sabine. ^[16. L. L., sq. (R. G.,] One of the three old tribes, the Tities, was believed to represent the Sabine element; ^[17. L. L.,] the second and the fourth kings are both of Sabine descent. By the great majority of modern writers the substance of the tradition, the fusion of a body of Sabine invaders with the original Latins, is accepted as historical; and even Mommsen allows its possibility, though he throws back the time of its occurrence to an earlier period than that of the union of the two settlements. ^[18. R. G., (R. G., (Rhein. Mus., (Latium u. Rom, (Topogr.,] We cannot here enter into the [9:20:732]question at length, but two statements may be safely made respecting it. The Sabine invasion, if it took place at all, must have taken place far back in the prehistoric age; it must have been on a small scale; and the Sabine invaders must have amalgamated easily and completely with the Latin settlers. The structure of the early Roman state, while it bears evident marks of a fusion of communities, shows no traces of a mixture of race. Nor is it easy to point to any provably Sabine element in the language, religion, or civilization of primitive Rome. ^[19. Unterital. Dialekten,] The theory of a Sabine conquest can hardly be maintained in the face of the predominantly Latin character of both people and institutions. On the other hand, the probability of a Sabine raid and a Sabine settlement, possibly on the Quirinal Hill, in very early times may be admitted. The incursions of the highland Apennine tribes into the lowlands fill a large place in early Italian history. The Latins were said to have originally descended from the mountain glens near Reate. ^[20.] The invasions of Campania and of Magna Grtecia by Sabellian tribes are matter of history, and the Sabines themselves are represented as a restless highland people, ever seeking new homes in richer lands. ^[21. Rom,. Gesch., Templum,] In very early days they appear on the borders of Latium, in close proximity to Rome, and Sabine forays are familiar and frequent occurrences in the old legends.

Such is all we know of the manner in which the separate settlements on the seven hills grew into a single city and community. How long Rome took in the making, or when or by whom the work was completed, we cannot say. Nor is it possible to give more than a very meagre outline of the constitution and of the history of the united state in the early days of its existence.

The “populus Romanus” was, we are told, divided into three tribes, Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres ^[22. L. L., Rhein. Mus.,] and into thirty “curiae.” The three tribes probably represent a primitive clan division, older than the Roman state itself. They survived in later times only as divisions of the ancient “equitum centuriae,” and even in the accounts of the earliest constitution they have ceased to serve as a political division of the people. ^[23. L. L., Patricisch. Rom,] Of far greater importance is the division into “curiae.” In Cicero’s time there were still curies, curial festivals, and curiate assemblies, and modern authors are unquestionably right in regarding the curia as the keystone of the primitive political system. It was a primitive association held together by participation in common “sacra,” and possessing common festivals, common priests, and a common chapel, hall, and hearth. The members of a curia were very probably neighbours and kinsmen, but the curia seems to represent a stage in political development midway between that in which clanship is the sole bond of union and that in which such claims as those of territorial contiguity and ownership of land have obtained recognition. As separate associations the curiae are probably older than the Roman state, but ^[24.] however this may be, it is certain that of this state when formed they constituted the only effective political subdivisions. The members of the thirty curiae are the populus Romanus, and the earliest known condition of Roman citizenship is the “communio sacrorum,” partnership in the curial “sacra.” Below the curia there was no further political division, for there is no reason to believe that the curia was ever formally subdivided into a fixed number of gentes and families ^[25. SenaSee cf. Philologus,] Nor can we assent to the view which would represent the curiae as containing only the “patrician gentes.” The primitive Roman people of the thirty curiae included all the freemen of the community, simple as well as gentle ^[26. (,R6m. Forschungen,]

At their head was the “rex,” the ruler of the united' people. The Roman “king” is not simply either the hereditary and patriarchal chief of a clan, the priestly head of a community bound together by common sacra, or the elected magistrate of a state, but a mixture of all three ^[27.] In later times, when no “patrician magistrates” were forthcoming to hold the elections for their successors, a procedure was adopted which was believed to represent the manner in which the early kings had been appointed ^[28. De Legg.,] In this procedure the ancient privileges of the old “gentes” and their elders, the importance of maintaining unbroken the continuity of the “sacra,” on the transmission and observance of which the welfare of the community depended, and thirdly the rights of the freemen, are all recognized. On the death of a king, the auspicia, and with them the supreme authority, revert to the council of elders, the “patres,” as representing the “gentes.” By the “patres” an “interrex” is appointed, who in turn nominates a second; by him, or even by a third or fourth interrex, a new king is selected in consultation with the “patres.” The king-designate is then proposed to the freemen assembled by their curiae for their acceptance, and finally their formal acceptance is ratified by the “patres,” as a security that the “sacra” of which they are the guardians have been respected. ^[29. {De Rep.,] Thus the king is in the first instance selected by the representatives of the old gentes, and they ratify his appointment. In form he is nominated directly by a predecessor from whose hands he receives the auspicia. But it is necessary also that the choice of the patres and the nomination of the interrex should be confirmed by a solemn vote of the community.

It is useless to attempt a precise definition of the prerogatives of the-king when once installed in office. Tradition ascribes to him a position and powers closely [9:20:733]resembling those of the heroic kings of Greece. He rules for life, and he is the sole ruler, unfettered by written statutes. He is the supreme judge, settling all disputes and punishing wrongdoers even with death. All other officials are appointed by him. He imposes taxes, distributes lands, and erects buildings. Senate and assembly meet only when he convenes them, and meet for little else than to receive communications from him. In war he is absolute leader ^[30. sq.] and finally he is also the religious head of the community. It is his business to consult the gods on its behalf, to offer the solemn sacrifices, and to announce the days of the public festivals. Hard by his house was the common hearth of the state, where the vestal virgins cherished the sacred fire.

By the side of the king stood the senate, or council of elders. In the descriptions left us of the primitive senate, as in those of the “rex,” we can discover traces of a transition from an earlier state of things when Rome was only an assemblage of clans or village communities, allied indeed, but each still ruled by its own chiefs and headmen, to one in which these groups have been fused into a single state under a common ruler. On the one hand the senate appears as a representative council of chiefs, with inalienable prerogatives of its own, and claiming to be the ultimate depository of the supreme authority and of the “sacra” connected with it. The senators are the “patres ”; they are taken from the leading “gentes”; they hold their seats for life; to them the “auspicia” revert on the death of a king; they appoint the interrex from their own body, are consulted in the choice of the new king, ^[31. Pro Domo,] and their sanction is necessary to ratify the vote of the assembled freemen. On the other hand they are no longer supreme. They cannot appoint a king but with the consent of the community, and their relation to the king when appointed is one of subordination. Vacancies in their ranks are filled up by him, and they can but give him advice and counsel when he chooses to consult them.

The popular assembly of united Rome in its earliest days was that in which the freemen met and voted by their curiae (comitia curiata ^[32. Cic. De Rep., ii. 13; Dionys., ii. 14, &c.]. The assembly met in the comitium at the north-east end of the forum, ^[33. Varro, L. L., v. 155. For the position of the “comitium,” see Smith, Diet. Geog., s.v. “Roma,” and Jordan, Topog. d. Stadt Rom.] at the summons and under the presidency of the king or, failing him, of the “interrex.” By the “rex” or “interrex” the question was put, and the voting took place “curiatim,” the curiae being called up in turn. The vote of each curia was decided by the majority of individual votes, and a majority of the votes of the curiae determined the final result. But the occasions on which the assembly could exercise its power must have been few. Their right to elect magistrates was apparently limited to the acceptance or rejection of the king proposed by the interrex. Of the passing of laws, in the later sense of the term, there is no trace in the kingly period. Dionysius’s statement^[34. l.c.] that they voted on questions of war and peace is improbable in itself and unsupported by tradition. They are indeed represented, in one instance, as deciding a capital case, but it is by the express permission of the king and not of right. ^[35. Livy, i. 26; Dionys., iii. 22.] Assemblies of the people were also, and probably more frequently, convened for other purposes. Not only did they meet to hear from the king the announcement of the high days and holidays for each month, and to witness such solemn religious rites as the inauguration of a priest, but their presence (and sometimes their vote) was further required to authorize and attest certain acts, which in a later age assumed a more private character. The disposal of property by will ^[36.] and the solemn renunciation of family or gentile “sacra” ^[37.] could only take place in the presence of the assembled freemen, while for adoption ^[38. Cf. Pro Domo,] (arrogatio) not only their presence but their formal consent was necessary.

Such in outline was the political structure of the Roman state at the earliest period known to us. It is clear that it belongs to a comparatively advanced stage in the development of society, and that a long previous history lies behind it. Traces of an older and more primitive order of things still linger in the three ancient shadowy tribes, in the curiae and gentes, in many of the features noticeable in the senate; but they are traces of an order that has passed away. The supremacy of the state is established over the groups out of whose fusion it has grown, and such of these groups as still retain a distinct existence are merely private corporations. Private differences are settled and wrongdoers punished by the state tribunals, and even within the close limits of the family the authority of the head is limited by the claims of the state upon the services of the sons and dependants.

A history of this early Roman state is out of the question. The names, dates, and achievements of the first four kings are all too unsubstantial to form the basis of a sober narrative; ^[39. Rom. Gescliichte, Early Rome, Credibility of Early Roman History.] a few points only can be considered as fairly well established. If we except the long eventless reign ascribed to King Numa, tradition represents the first kings as incessantly at war with their immediate neighbours. The details of these wars are no doubt mythical; but the implied condition of continual struggle, and the narrow range within which the struggle is confined, may be accepted as true. The picture drawn is that of a small community with a few square miles of territory, at deadly feud with its nearest neighbours, within a radius of some 12 miles round Rome. Nor, in spite of the repeated victories with which tradition credits Romulus, Ancus, and Tullus, does there seem to have been any real extension of Roman territory except towards the sea. Fidense remains Etruscan; the Sabines continue masters up to the Anio; Prseneste, Gabii, and Tusculum are still untouched; and on this side it is doubtful if Roman territory, in spite of the possible destruction of Alba, extended to a greater distance than, the sixth milestone from Rome. ^[40. Cf. Fast., “pera£v yovv tov irlyirTov Kai tov cktov XlOov . . . t6ttos ^rjffTOi . . . upLov Tys tJt€ Pa>fj.aicvv yys.”] But along the course of the Tiber below the city there was a decided advance. The fortification of the Janiculum, the building of the “pons sublicius,” the foundation of Ostia, and the acquisition of the saltworks near the sea may all be safely ascribed to this early period. Closely connected, too, with the control of the Tiber from Rome to the sea was the subjugation of the petty Latin communities lying south of the river; and the tradition of the conquest and destruction of Poli-torium, Tellenre, and Ficana is confirmed by the absence in historical times of any Latin communities in this district.

With the reign of theifth king Tarquinius Priscus a marked change takes place. The traditional accounts of the last three kings not only wear a more historical air [9:20:734]than those of the first four, but they describe something like a transformation of the Roman city and state. Under the rule of these latter kings the separate settlements are for the first time enclosed with a rampart of colossal size and extent. ^[41.] The low grounds are drained, and a forum and circus elaborately laid out; on the Capitoline Mount a temple is erected, the massive foundations of which were an object of wonder even to Pliny. ^[42. If.,] To the same period are assigned the redivision of the city area into four new districts and the introduction of a new military system, The kings increase in power and surround themselves with new splendour. Abroad, too, Rome suddenly appears as a powerful state ruling far and wide over southern Etruria and Latium. These startling changes are, moreover, ascribed to kings of alien descent, who one and all ascend the throne in the teeth of established constitutional forms. Finally, with the expulsion of the last of them—the younger Tarquin—comes a sudden shrinkage of power. At the commencement of the republic Rome is once more a comparatively small state, with hostile and independent neighbours at her very doors. It is difficult to avoid the conviction that the true explanation of this phenomenon is to be found in the supposition that Rome during this period passed under the rule of powerful Etruscan lords. ^[43.] In the 7th and 6th centuries b.c., and probably earlier still, the Etruscans appear as ruling widely outside the limits of Etruria proper. They were supreme in the valley of the Po until their power there was broken by the irruption of Celtic tribes from beyond the Alps, and while still masters of the plains of Lombardy they established themselves in the rich lowlands of Campania, where they held their ground until the capture of Capua by the Samnite highlanders in 423 b.c. It is on the face of it improbable that a power which had extended its sway from the Alps to the Tiber, and from the Liris to Surrentum, should have left untouched the intervening stretch of country between the Tiber and the Liris. Nor are we without evidence of Etruscan rule in Latium. ^[44. Latium u. Rom, Mastama] According to Dionysius there was a time when the Latins were known to the Greeks as Tyrrhenians, and Rome as a Tyrrhenian city. ^[45.] When JEneas landed in Italy the Latins were at feud with Turnus (Turrlienos? Dionys., i. 64) of Ardea, whose close ally is the ruthless Mezentius, prince of Caere, to whom the Latins had been forced to pay a tribute of wine. ^[46. Q. R.,] Cato declared the Volsci to have been once subject to Etruscan rule, ^[47. Aen.,] and Etruscan remains found at Velitrae, ^[48. Ann. d. Inst.,] as well as the second name of the Volscian Auxur, Tarracina (the city of Tarchon), tend to confirm his statement. Nearer still to Rome is Tusculum, with its significant name, and at Alba we hear of a prince Tap^e-rios, ^[49. Rom., irapavofuiiTa-ros koi ¿¡pöraros; cf. Aen., x.] lawless and cruel like Mezentius, who consults the “oracle of Tethys in Tyrrhenia.” Thus we find the Etruscan power encircling Rome on all sides, and in Rome itself a tradition of the rule of princes of Etruscan origin. The Tarquinii come from South Etruria; their name can hardly be anything else than the Latin equivalent of the Etruscan Tarchon, and is therefore possibly a title

(= “lord” or “prince ”) rather than a proper name. ^[50. Latium u. Rom, ef. Aen., x.] Even Servius Tullius Was identified by Tuscan chroniclers with an Etruscan “Mastarna.” ^[51. Tab. Lugd., Annals of Mastama, sq.; Annali dell. Inslit.,] Again, what we are told of Etruscan conquests does not represent them as moving, like the Sabellian tribes, in large bodies and settling down en masse in the conquered districts. We hear rather of military raids led by ambitious chiefs who carve out principalities for themselves with their own good swords, and with their followers rule oppressively over alien and subject peoples. ^[52. Cf.] And so at Rome the story of the Tarquins implies not a wave of Etruscan immigration so much as a rule of Etruscan princes over conquered Latins.

The achievements ascribed to the Tarquins are not less characteristic. Their despotic rule and splendour contrast with the primitive simplicity of the native kings. Only Etruscan builders, under the direction of wealthy and powerful Etruscan lords, could have built the great cloaca, the Servian wall, or the Capitoline temple,'—monuments which challenged comparison with those of the emperors themselves. Nor do the traces of Greek influence upon Rome during this period ^[53. R. G., sq.] conflict with the theory of an Etruscan supremacy; on the contrary, it is at least possible that it was thanks to the extended rule and wide connexions of her Etruscan rulers that Rome was first brought into direct contact with the Greeks, who had long traded with the Etruscan ports and influenced Etruscan culture. ^[54. Rhein. Mus., sq. Röm. Chronologie, Journ. of Philol.,]

These Etruscan princes are represented, not only as having raised Rome for the time to a commanding position in Latium and lavished upon the city itself the resources of Etruscan civilization, but also as the authors of important internal changes. They are represented as favouring new men at the expense of the old patrician families, and as reorganizing the Roman army on a new footing, a policy natural enough in military princes of alien birth, and rendered possible by the additions which conquest had made to the original community. From among the leading families of the conquered Latin states a hundred new members were admitted to the senate, and these gentes thenceforth ranked as patrician, and became known as “gentes minores.” ^[55. De Rep.,] The changes in the army begun, it is said, by the elder Tarquin and completed by Servius Tullius were more important. The basis of the primitive military system had been the three tribes, each of which furnished 1000 men to the legion and 100 to the cavalry. ^[56. L. L.,] Tarquinius Priscus, we are told, contemplated the creation of three fresh tribes and three additional centuries of horsemen with new names, ^[57.] though in face of the opposition offered by the old families he contented himself with simply doubling the strength without altering the names of the old divisions. ^[58. cf.] But the change attributed to

(Leipsic, 1882); Cuno’s Verbreitung d. Etr. Stammes (Graudenz, 1880) is highly fanciful.
[9:20:735]

Servius Tullius went far beyond this. His famous distribution of all freeholders (assidui) into tribes, classes, and centuries, ^[59. De Rep.,] though subsequently adopted with modifications as the basis of the political system, was at first exclusively military in its nature and objects. ^[60.] It amounted in fact to the formation of a new and enlarged army on a new footing. In this force, excepting in the case of the centuries of the horsemen, no regard was paid either to the old clan divisions, or to the semi-religious semipolitical curiae. In its ranks were included all freeholders within the Roman territory, whether members or not of any of the old divisions, and the organization of this new army of assidui was not less independent of the old system with its clannish and religious traditions and forms. The unit was the “eenturia” or company of 100 men; the centuriae were grouped in “classes” and drawn up in the order of the phalanx. ^[61.] The centuries in front were composed of the wealthier citizens, whose means enabled them to bear the cost of the complete equipments necessary for those who were to bear the brunt of the onset. These centuries formed the first class. Behind them stood the centuries of the second and third classes, less completely armed, but making up together with those of the first class the heavy-armed infantry. ^[62. cf. Rom,. Tribus,] In the rear were the centuries of the fourth and fifth classes, recruited from the poorer freeholders, and serving only as lightarmed troops. The entire available body of freeholders was divided into two equal portions, a reserve corps ofseniores” and a corps of “juniores” for active service. Each of these corps consisted of 85 centuries or 8500 men, i.e., of two legions of about 4200 men each, the normal strength of a consular legion under the early republic. ^[63. Rom. Trib., sq.] It is noticeable also that the heavy-armed centuries of the three first classes in each of these legions represented a total of 3000 men, a number which agrees exactly with the number of heavy-armed troops in the legion as described by Polybius. Attached to the legions, but not included in them, were the companies of sappers and trumpeters. Lastly, to the six centuries of horsemen, which still retained the old tribal names, twelve more were added as a distinct body, and recruited from the wealthiest class of citizens. ^[64. (De Rep., De Rep.,] The fourtribes” also instituted by Servius were probably intended to serve as the basis for the levy of freeholders for the new army. ^[65. ras Karaypa^as rav arpanuTwi'.] As their names show, they corresponded with the natural local divisions of the city territory, ^[66.] but that they included freeholders residing on Roman territory but outside Rome is indicated by the fact that both Ostia and Alba belonged to the Palatine tribe. ^[67. Imperium R. tributim descriptum, cf.]

The last of these Etruscan lords to rule in Rome was Tarquín the Proud. He is described as a splendid and despotic monarch. His sway extended over Latium as * far south as Circeii. Aristodemus, tyrant of Cumse, was his ally, and kinsmen of his own were princes at Collatia, at Gabii, and at Tusculum. The Volscian highlanders were chastised, and Signia with its massive walls was built to hold them in check. In Rome itself the Capitoline temple and the great cloaca bore witness to his power. But his rule pressed heavily upon the Romans, and at the last, on the news of the foul wrong done by his son Sextus to a noble Roman matron, Lucretia, the indignant people rose in revolt. Tarquín, who was away besieging Ardea, was deposed; sentence of exile was passed upon him and upon all his race; and the people swore that never again should a king rule in Rome. Freed from the tyrant, they chose for themselves two yearly magistrates who should exercise the supreme authority, and thus the republic of Rome was founded. Three times the banished Tarquín strove desperately to recover the throne he had lost. First of all the men of Veii and Tarquinii marched to his aid, but were defeated in a pitched battle on the Roman frontier. A year later Lars Porsena, prince of Clusium, at the head of all the powers of Etruria, appeared before the gates of Rome, and closely besieged the city, until, moved by the valour of his foe, he granted honourable terms of peace and withdrew. ^[68. (N. H., (Ann., sq.) (Latium u. Rom,] Once again, by Lake Regillus, the Romans fought victoriously for their liberty against Tarquin’s son-in-law Mamilius, prince of Tusculum, and chief of the Latin name. Mamilius was slain; Tarquín in despair found a refuge at Cumse, and there soon afterwards died.

So, in brief, ran the story of the flight of the kings, as it was told by the chroniclers whom Livy followed. Its details are most of them fabulous; it is crowded with inconsistencies and improbabilities; there are no trustworthy dates; the names even of the chief actors are probably fictitious, and the hand of the improver, Greek or Roman, is traceable throughout. ^[69.] The struggle was doubtless longer and sharper, and the new constitution more gradually shaped, than tradition would have us believe. Possibly, too, this revolution in Rome was but a part of a widespreading wave of change in Latium and central Italy, similar to that which in Greece swept away the old heroic monarchies. But there is no room for doubting the main facts of the emancipation of Rome from the rule of alien princes and the final abolition of the kingly office.

II. The Republic. Period I.: 509-265 b.c. ^[70.] —(a) The Struggle between the Orders.— It is characteristic of Rome that the change from monarchy to republic ^[71. cf. Röm. Forsch.,] should have been made with the least possible disturbance of existing forms. The title of king was retained, though only as that of a priestly officer (rex sacrorum) to whom some of the religious functions of the former kings were transferred. The two annually elected consuls, or “praetores,” ^[72. Staatsrecht,] were regarded as joint heirs of the full kingiy authority, and as holding the “imperium,” and the correlative right of auspices, by [9:20:736]direct transmission from the founder of the city. They were, it is true, elected or created by a new assembly, by the army of freeholders voting by their classes and centuries (comitia centuriata), and to this body was given also the right of passing laws; but nevertheless it was still by a vote of the 30 curies (lex curiata) that the supreme authority was formally conferred on the magistrates chosen by the centuries of freeholders, and both the choice of magistrates and the passing of laws still required the sanction of the patrician senators (patrum auctoritas). ^[73. (Forsch.,] Nor, lastly, were the legal prerogatives of the senate altered, although it is probable that before long plebeians were admitted to seats, if not to votes, and though its importance was gradually increased by the substitution of an annual magistracy for the life-long rule of a single king. But the abolition of the monarchy brought with it a change of the utmost importance in the actual working of the constitution. Though the distinction between patricians and plebeians was at least as old as the state itself, it is not until the establishment of the republic that it plays any part in the history of Rome. No sooner, however, was the overshadowing authority of the king removed than a struggle commenced between the two orders which lasted for more than two centuries. It was in no sense a struggle between a conquering and a conquered class, or between an exclusive citizen body and an unenfranchised mass outside its pale. ^[74.] Patricians and plebeians were equally citizens of Rome, sprung of the same race and speaking the same tongue. The former were the members of those ancient “gentes” which had possibly been once the “chiefly” families in the small communities which preceded the united state, and which claimed by hereditary right a privileged position in the community. Only patricians could sit in the council of patres, and hence probably the name given to their order. ^[75. De Rep., sq. Hermes,] To their representatives the supreme authority reverted on the death of the king the due transmission of the auspicia and the public worship of the state gods were their special care; and to them alone were known the traditional usages and forms which regulated the life of the people from day to day. To the “plebs” (the multitude, 7tA?7#os) belonged all who were not members of some patrician gens, whether independent freemen or attached as “clients” ^[76. (Forsch.,] to one of the great houses. The plebeian was a citizen, with civil rights and a vote in the assembly of the curies, but he was excluded by ancient custom from all share in the higher honours of the state, and intermarriage with a patrician was not recognized as a properly legal union.

The revolution which expelled the Tarquins gave the patricians, who had mainly assisted in bringing it about, an overwhelming ascendency in the state. The plebs had indeed gained something. Not only is it probable that the strictness of the old tie of clientship had somewhat relaxed, and that the number of the “clientes” was smaller and their dependence on patrician patrons less complete, but the ranks of the plebs had, under the later kings, been swelled by the admission of conquered Latins, and the freeholders among these had with others been enrolled in the Servian tribes, classes, and centuries. The establishment of the republic invested this military levy of free-

holders with political rights as an assembly, for by their votes the consuls were chosen and laws passed, and it was the plebeian freeholders who formed the main strength of the plebs in the struggle that followed. But these gains were greater in appearance than in reality. The plebeian freeholders commanded only a minority of votes in the comitia centuriata. In their choice of magistrates they were limited to the patrician candidates nominated by patrician presiding magistrates, and their choice required confirmation not only by the older and smaller assembly of the curiae, in which the patricians and their clients predominated, but also by the patrician patres. They could only vote on laws proposed by patrician consuls, and here again the subsequent sanction of the patres was necessary. The whole procedure of the comitia was in short absolutely in the hands of their patrician presidents, and liable to every sort of interruption and suspension from patrician pontiffs and augurs.

But these political disabilities did not constitute the main grievance of the plebs in the early years of the republic. What they fought for was protection for their lives and liberties, and the object of attack was the despotic authority of the patrician magistrates. The consuls wielded the full “imperium” of the kings, and against this “consular authority” the plebeian, though a citizen, had no protection and no appeal, and matters were only worse when for the two consuls was substituted in some emergency a single, all-powerful, irresponsible dictator. In Rome, as in Greece, the first efforts of the people were directed against the arbitrary powers of the executive magistrate.

The history of this struggle between the orders opens with a concession made to the plebs by one of the consuls themselves, a concession possibly due to a desire to secure the allegiance of the plebeian freeholders, who formed the backbone of the army. In the very first year of the republic, according to the received chronology, P. Valerius Poplicola carried in the comitia centuriata his famous law of appeal. ^[77. De Rep., cf.] It enacted that no magistrate, saving only a dictator, should execute a capital sentence upon any Roman citizen unless the sentence had been confirmed on appeal by the assembly of the centuries. But, though the “right of appeal” granted by this law was justly regarded in later times as the greatest safeguard of a Roman’s liberties, it was by no means at first so effective a protection as it afterwards became. For not only was the operation of the law limited to the bounds of the city, so that the consul in the field or on the march was left as absolute as before, but no security was provided for its observance even within the city by consuls resolved to disregard it.

It was by their own efforts that the plebeians first' obtained any real protection against magisterial despotism. The traditional accounts of the first secession are con-; fused and contradictory ^[78. sq.] but its causes and results are tolerably clear. The seceders were the plebeian legionaries recently returned from a victorious campaign, indignant at the delay of the promised reforms, they ignored the order given them to march afresh against Volsci and Aiqui, and instead entrenched themselves on a hill across the Anio, some three miles from Rome, and known afterwards as the Mons Sacer. The frightened patricians came to terms, and a solemn agreement (lex sacrata) ^[79.] was concluded between the orders, by which it was provided that henceforth the plebeians should have annual magistrates of their own (tribuni plebis), members of their own order, who should be authorized to protect them against the [9:20:737]of 449 clearly involved more than a restoration of the old form of government. The Valerio-Horatian laws, besides reaffirming the right of appeal and the inviolability of the tribunes, improved the position of the plebeian assemblies by enacting that “plebiscita” passed in them, and, as seems probable, approved by the patres, should be binding on patricians as well as plebeians. ^[80.] By this law the tribunes obtained a recognized initiative in legislation. Henceforth the desired reforms were introduced and carried by tribunes in what were now styled “comitia tributa,” and, if sanctioned by the patres, became laws of the state. From this period, too, must be dated the legalization at any rate of the tribune’s right to impeach any citizen before the assembly of the tribes. ^[81.] Henceforward there is no question of the tribune’s right to propose to the plebs to impose a fine, or of the validity of the sentence when passed. The efficiency of these new -weapons of attack was amply proved by the subsequent course of the struggle. Only a few years after the Valerio-Horatian legislation came the lex Canuleia (445 b.c.), by -which mixed marriages between patricians and plebeians were declared lawful, and the social exclusiveness of the patriciate broken down. In the same year with this measure, and like it in the interests primarily of the wealthier plebeians, a vigorous attack commenced on the patrician monopoly of the consulate, and round this stronghold of patrician ascendency the conflict raged until the passing of the Licinian laws in 367. The original proposal of Canuleius in 445 that the people should be allowed to elect a plebeian consul was evaded by a compromise. The senate resolved that for the next year, in the stead of consuls, six military tribunes with consular powers should be elected, ^[82. cf. Staalsrecht,] and that the new office should be open to patricians and plebeians alike. The consulship was thus for the time saved from pollution, as the patricians phrased it, but the growing strength of the plebs is shown by the fact that in fifty years out of the seventy-eight between 444 and 366 they succeeded in obtaining the election of consular tribunes rather than of consuls. A good omen for their ultimate success was a victory they won in connexion with the inferior office of the qusestorship. Down to the time of the decemvirate the quaestors had been nominated by the consuls, but in 447 their appointment was transferred to the plebeian “comitia tributa,” and in 421 the first plebeian was elected to the office. ^[83. Staatsrecht,] Despite, however, these discouragements, the patricians fought on. Each year they strove to secure the creation of consuls rather than consular tribunes, and failing this strained every nerve to secure for their own order at least a majority among the latter. Even the institution of the censorship (435), though rendered desirable by the increasing importance and complexity of the census, was, it is probable, due in part to their desire to discount beforehand the threatened loss of the consulship by diminishing its powers. ^[84. ib..] Other causes, too, helped to protract the struggle. Between the wealthier plebeians, who were ambitious of high office, and the poorer, whose minds were set rather on allotments of land, there was a division of interest of which the patricians were not slow to take advantage, and to this must be added the pressure of war. The death struggle with Veii and the sack of Rome by the Gauls absorbed for the time all the energies of the community. In 377, however, two of the tribunes, C. I.icinius Stolo and L. Sextius, came forward with proposals which united all sections of the plebs in their support. Their proposals were as follows: ^[85. B. C.,] (1) that consuls and not consular tribunes be elected; (2) that one consul at least should be a plebeian; (3) that the priestly college, which had the charge of the Sibylline books, should consist of ten members instead of two, and that of these half should be plebeians; (4) that no single citizen should hold in occupation more than 500 acres of the common lands, or pasture upon them more than 100 head of cattle and 500 sheep; (5) that all landowners should employ a certain amount of free as w r ell as slave labour on their estates ; (6) that interest already paid on debts should be deducted from the principal, and the remainder paid off in three years. The three last proposals w’ere obviously intended to meet the demands of the poorer plebeians, and to secure their support for the first half of the scheme. Ten years of bitter conflict followed, but at last, in 367 b.c., the Licinian rogations became law, and one of their authors, L. Sextius, was created the first plebeian consul. For the moment it was some consolation to the patricians that they not only succeeded in detaching from the consulship the administration of civil law, which was entrusted to a separate officer, “praetor urbanus,” to be elected by the comitia of the centuries, with an understanding apparently that he should be a patrician, but also obtained the institution of two additional sediles (“aediles curules”), who were in like manner to be members of their own order. ^[86.] With the opening of the consulship, however, the issue of the long contest was virtually decided, and the next eighty years witnessed a rapid succession of plebeian victories. Now that a plebeian consul might preside at the elections, the main difficulty in the way of the nomination and election of plebeian candidates -was removed. The proposed patrician monopoly of the new curule sedileship was almost instantly abandoned. In 356 the first plebeian was made dictator, in 350 the censorship, and in 337 the praetorship were filled for the first time by plebeians, and lastly, in 300, by the lex Ogulnia, even the sacred colleges of the pontiffs and augurs, the old strongholds of patrician supremacy, were thrown open to the plebs ^[87.] The patricians lost also the control they had exercised so long over the action of the people in assembly. The “patrum auctoritas,” the sanction given or refused by the patrician senators to laws and to elections, had hitherto been a powerful weapon in their hands. But in 339 a law of Q. Publilius Philo, a plebeian dictator, enacted that this sanction should be given beforehand to all laws ^[88. cf. Brut.,] and by a lex Maenia, carried apparently some fifty years later, the same rule was extended to elections. Henceforward the “patrum auctoritas” sank into a meaningless form, though as such it still survived in the time of Livy. A second Publilian law affirmed afresh the validity of “plebiscita,” i.e., of measures carried in the plebeian comitia tributa. Apparently, however, their validity was still left subject to some conditions, for in 287 a lex Hortensia, carried by another plebeian dictator, was found necessary finally to settle the question. ^[89.] From 287 onwards it is certain that measures passed by the plebs, voting by their tribes, had the full force of law’s without sentences. They propose fines, which are confirmed by the comitia tributa.
[9:20:738]

consuls, ^[90. De Rep.,] and a curse was invoked upon the man who I should injure or impede the tribune in the performance of his duties. ^[91.] The number of tribunes was at first two, then five, and before 449 b.c. it had been raised to ten. The fact that the institution of the tribunate of the plebs was the one result of the first secession is strong evidence that the object of the seceders was not economic or agrarian reform but protection against the consuls. The tribunate gave them this protection in a form which has no parallel in history. The tribune was not, and, strictly speaking, never became, a magistrate of the Roman people. His one proper prerogative was that of granting protection to the oppressed plebeian against a patrician officer. This prerogative (jus auxilii) was secured to the tribunes, not by the ordinary constitution, but by a special compact between the orders, and was protected by the ancient oath (vetus jusjurandum), ^[92. B. C.,] which invoked a curse upon the violator of a tribune. This exceptional and anomalous right the tribunes could only exercise in person, within the limits of the “pomoerium,” and against individual acts of magisterial oppression. ^[93.] It was only gradually that it expanded into the later wide power of interference with the whole machinery of government, and was supplemented by the legislative and judicial powers which rendered the tribunate of the last century B.c. so formidable, and the “tribunitia potestas” so essential an element in the authority of the emperors.

But from the first the tribunes were for the plebs not only protectors but leaders, under whom they organized themselves in opposition to the patricians. The tribunes convened assemblies of the plebs (concilia plebis), and carried resolutions on questions of interest to the order. This incipient plebeian organization was materially advanced by the Publilian law of 471 b.c., ^[94.] which appears to have formally recognized as lawful the plebeian concilia, and established also the tribune’s right “cum plebe agere,” i.e., to propose and carry resolutions in them. These assemblies were “tributa,” or, in other words, the voting in them took place not by curies or centuries but by tribes. In them, lastly, after the Publilian law, if not before, the tribunes were annually elected. ^[95.] By this law the foundations were laid both of the powerful “comitia tributa” ^[96.] of later days and also of the legislative and judicial prerogatives of the tribunes. The patricians maintained indeed that resolutions (plebiscita) carried by tribunes in the concilia plebis were not binding on their order, but the moral weight of such resolutions, whether they affirmed a general principle or pronounced sentence of condemnation on some single patrician, was no doubt considerable.

It is at any rate certain that the passing of the Publilian law was followed by increased activity on the part of the tribunes. The attack on the consular authority was continued, and combined with it we have a persistent effort made to secure for the plebs their fair share of the common lands of the state (agri publici). The main object, however, of this early agrarian agitation was not economic but political. Membership in a tribe was now more than ever important for a plebeian, as giving a vote not only in the comitia centuriata but also in the plebeian “concilia,” and membership in a tribe was possible as yet only for freeholders. ^[97.] To increase the number of freeholders became therefore a matter of importance, and the simplest mode of increasing the number of freeholders was for the state to create freeholds on the common lands. But such a policy met with bitter opposition from the patricians, who had long enjoyed a virtual monopoly of these lands, and had excluded the plebeians even from those more recently acquired tracts which they had helped to win by their swords. Against this patrician monopoly the tribunes unceasingly protested from a few years after the first secession down to 465 b.c. ^[98. Rom. Forsch.,] In that year a compromise was effected by the colonization of Antium, which had been taken the year before, and the plebeians obtained land without any disturbance of patrician occupiers. Eleven years later the common lands on the Aventine were reclaimed and assigned to plebeians by a lex Icilia. ^[99.]

But this agrarian agitation, though destined subsequently to play an important part in the history, was for the time far less fruitful in results than that which was directed against the consular authority.

The proposal of C. Terentilius Arsa (460 b.c.) to appoint a plebeian commission to draw up laws restricting the powers of the consuls ^[100.] was resolutely opposed by the patricians, but after ten years of bitter party strife a compromise was effected. A commission of ten patricians was appointed, who should frame and publish a code of law binding equally on both the orders. These decemviri were to be the sole and supreme magistrates for the year, and the law of appeal was suspended in their favour. ^[101.] The code which they promulgated, the famous XII. Tables, owed little of its importance to any novelties or improvements contained in its provisions. For the most part it seems merely to have reaffirmed existing usages and laws (see Roman Law). But it substituted a public, written law, binding on all citizens of Rome, for an unwritten usage, the knowledge of which was confined to a few patricians, and which had been administered by this minority in their own interests. With the publication of the code the proper work of the decemvirs was finished; nevertheless for the next year a fresh decemvirate was elected, and it is conceivable that the intention was permanently to substitute government by an irresponsible patrician “council of ten” for the old constitution. However this may have been, the tyranny of the decemvirs themselves was fatal to the continuance of their power. We are told of a second secession of the plebs, this time to the Janiculum, and of negotiations with the senate, the result of which was the enforced abdication of the decemvirs. The plebs joyfully chose for themselves tribunes, and in the comitia centuriata two consuls were created. But this restoration of the old regime was accompanied by legislation which made it an important crisis in the history of the struggle between the orders. With the fall of the decemvirate this struggle enters upon a new phase. The tribunes appear as at once more powerful and more strictly constitutional magistrates; the plebeian “concilia” take their place as formal comitia by the side of the older assemblies; and finally this improved machinery is used not simply in self-defence against patrician oppression but to obtain complete political equality. This change was no doubt due in part to circumstances outside legislation, above all to the expansion of the Roman state, which swelled the numbers and added to the social importance of the plebs as compared with the dwindling forces of the close corporation of patrician gentes. Still the legislation

Mommsen, Forsch., i. 185.
[9:20:739]

any further conditions whatsoever. The legislative independence of the plebeian assembly was secured, and with this crowning victory ended the long struggle between the orders.

(6) Conquest of Italy.— Twelve years after the passing of the lex Hortensia, King Pyrrhus, beaten at Beneventum, withdrew from Italy, and Rome was left mistress of the peninsula. The steps by which this supremacy had been won have now to be traced. Under the rule of her Etruscan princes Rome spread her sway over the lowlands of Latium, and her arms were a terror to the warlike highlanders of the Sabine and Volscian hills. But with their fall this miniature empire fell also, and at first it seemed as if the infant republic, torn by internal dissensions, must succumb to the foes who threatened it from so many sides at once. It was only after one hundred and fifty years of almost constant war that Rome succeeded in rolling back the tide of invasion and in establishing her supremacy over the neighbouring lowlands and over the hill country which bordered them to the east and south. The close of this first stage in her external growth is conveniently marked by the first collision with the Sabellian peoples beyond the Liris in 343. ^[102.] In marked contrast with the slowness of her advance up to this point is the fact that only seventy-five years more were needed for the virtual subjugation of all the rest of the peninsula (343-269).

The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, followed as it seems to have been by the emancipation from Etruscan supremacy of all the country between the Tiber and the Liris, entirely altered the aspect of affairs. North of the Tiber the powerful Etruscan city of Veii, after a vain attempt to restore the Tarquins, relapsed into an attitude of sullen hostility towards Rome, which, down to the outbreak of the final struggle in 407, found vent in constant and harassing border forays. The Sabines recommenced their raids across the Anio; from their hills to the south-east the Aequi pressed forward as far as the eastern spurs of the Alban range, and ravaged the plain country between that range and the Sabine mountains; the Volsci overran the coast-lands as far as Antium, established themselves at Velitrae, and even ravaged the fields within a few miles of Rome. But the good fortune of Rome did not leave her to face these foes single-handed, and it is a significant fact that the history of the Roman advance begins, not with a brilliant victory, but with a useful and timely alliance. According to Livy, it was in 493, only a few years after the defeat of the prince of Tusculum at Lake Regillus, that a treaty was concluded between Rome and the Latin communities of the Campagna. ^[103. Pro Balbo,] The alliance was in every respect natural. The Latins were the near neighbours and kinsmen of the Romans, and both Romans and Latins were just freed from Etruscan rule to find themselves as lowlanders and dwellers in towns face to face with a common foe in the ruder hill tribes on their borders. The exact terms of the treaty cannot, any more than the precise circumstances under which it was concluded, be stated with certainty (see Latium), but two points seem clear. There was at first a genuine equality in the relations between the allies.; Romans and Latins, though combining for defence and offence, did so without sacrificing their separate freedom of action, even in the matter of waging wars independently of each other. ^[104.] But, secondly, Rome enjoyed from the first one inestimable advantage. The Latins lay between her and the most active of her foes, the Aequi and Volsci, and served to protect her territories at the expense of their own. Behind this barrier Rome grew strong, and the close of the -zEciuian and Volscian wars left the Latins her dependents rather than her allies. Beyond the limits of the Campagna Rome found a second ally, hardly less useful than the Latins, in the tribe of the Hernici (“the men of the rocks ”), in the valley of the Trerus, who had equal reason with the Romans and Latins to dread the Volsci and Aequi, while their position midway between the two latter peoples made them valuable auxiliaries to the lowlanders of the Campagna.

The treaty with the Hernici is said to have been concluded in 486, ^[105.] and the confederacy of the three peoples —Romans, Latins, and Hernicans—lasted down to the great Latin war in 340. Confused and untrustworthy as are the chronicles of the early wars of Rome, it is clear that notwithstanding the acquisition of these allies Rome made but little way against her foes during the first fifty years of the existence of the republic. In 474, it is true, an end was put for a time to the harassing border feud with Veii by a forty years’ peace, an advantage due not so much to Roman valour as to the increasing dangers from other quarters which were threatening the Etruscan states. ^[106.] But this partial success stands alone, and down to 449 the raids of Sabines, Aequi, and Volsci continue without intermission, and are occasionally carried up to the very walls of Rome. Very different is the impression left by the annals of the next sixty years (449-390). During this period there is an unmistakable development of Roman power on all sides.

In southern Etruria the capture of Veii (396) virtually gave Rome the mastery as far as the Ciminian forest. Sutrium and Nepete, “the gates of Etruria,” became her allies and guarded her interests against any attack from the Etruscan communities to the north, while along the Tiber valley her suzerainty was acknowledged as far as Capena and Falerii. On the Anio frontier we hear of no disturbances from 449 until some ten years after the sack of Rome by the Gauls. In 446 the Aequi appear for the last time before the gates of Rome. After 418 they disappear from Mount Algidus, and in the same year the communications of Rome and Latium with the Hernici in the Trerus valley were secured by the capture and colonization of Labicum. Successive invasions, too, broke the strength of the Volsci, and in 393 a Latin colony was founded as far south as Circeii. In part, no doubt, these Roman successes were due to the improved condition of affairs in Rome itself, consequent upon the great reforms carried between 450 and 442; but it is equally certain that now as often afterwards fortune befriended Rome by weakening, or by diverting the attention of, her opponents. In particular, her rapid advance in southern Etruria was facilitated by the heavy blows inflicted upon the Etruscans during the 5th century b.c. by Celts, Greeks, and Samnites. By the close of this century the Celts had expelled them from the rich plains of what was afterwards known as Cisalpine Gaul, and were even threatening to advance across the Apennines into Etruria proper. The Sicilian Greeks, headed by the tyrants of Syracuse, wrested from them their mastery of the seas, and finally, .on the capture of Capua by the Samnites in 423, they lost their possessions in the fertile Campanian plain. These conquests of the Samnites were part of a great southward movement of the highland Sabellian peoples, the immediate effects of which upon the fortunes of Rome were not confined to the weakening of the Etruscan power. It is probable that the cessation of the Sabine raids across the Anio was partly due to the new outlets which were opened southwards for the restless and populous hill tribes which had so long disturbed the peace of the Latin lowlands. We may conjecture, also,
[9:20:740]

that the growing feebleness exhibited by Volsci and Aequi was in some measure caused by the pressure upon their rear of the Sabellian clans which at this time established themselves near the Fucine Lake and along the course of the Liris.

But in 390, only six years after the great victory over her ancient rival Veii, the Roman advance was for a moment checked by a disaster which threatened to alter the course of history in Italy, and which left a lasting impress on the Roman mind. In 391 a Celtic horde left their newly won lands on the Adriatic, and, crossing the Apennines into Etruria, laid siege to the Etruscan city of Clusium (Chiusi). Thence, provoked, it is said, by the conduct of the Roman ambassadors, who, forgetting their sacred character, had fought in the ranks of Clusium and slain a Celtic chief, the barbarians marched upon Rome. On July 18, 390 B.c., only a few miles from Rome, was fought the disastrous battle of the Allia. The defeat of the Romans was complete, and Rome lay at the ercy of her foe. But in characteristic fashion the Celts halted three days to enjoy the fruits of victory, and time was thus given to put the Capitol at least in a state of defence. The arrival of the barbarians was followed by the sack of the city, but the Capitol remained impregnable. For seven months they besieged it, and then in as sudden a fashion as they had come they disappeared. The Roman chroniclers explain their retreat in their own way, by the fortunate appearance of Camillus with the troops which he had collected, at the very moment when famine had forced the garrison on the Capitol to accept terms. More probably the news that their lands across the Apennines were threatened by the Veneti, coupled with the unaccustomed tedium of a long siege and the difficulty of obtaining supplies, inclined the Celts to accept readily a heavy ransom as the price of their withdrawal. But, whatever the reason, it is certain that they retreated, and, though during the next fifty years marauding bands appeared at intervals in the neighbourhood of Rome, and even once penetrated as far south as Campania (361-360), the Celts never obtained any footing in Italy outside the plains in the north which they had made their own.

Nor, in spite of the defeat on the Allia and the sack of the city, was Rome weakened except for the moment by the Celtic attack. The storm passed away as rapidly as it had come on. The city was hastily rebuilt, and Rome dismayed the enemies who hastened to take advantage of her misfortunes by her undiminished vigour. Her conquests in southern Etruria were successfully defended against repeated attacks from the Etruscans to the north. The creation in 387 of four new tribes (Stellatina, Sabatina, Tromentina, Arniensis) marked the final annexation of the territory of Veii and of the lands lying along the Tiber valley. A few years later Latin colonies were established at Sutrium and Nepete for the more effectual defence of the frontier, and finally, in 353, the subjugation of South Etruria was completed by the submission of Caere (Cervetri) and its partial incorporation with the Roman state as a “municipium sine suffragio ”—the first, it is said, of its kind. ^[107. Staatsverw., sq. R. Verf., I tai. Bund,]

Next to the settlement of southern Etruria, the most important of the successes gained by Rome between 390 and 343 b.c. were those won against her old foes the Aequi and Volsci, and her old allies the Latins and Hernicans. The Aequi indeed, already weakened by their long feud with Rome, and hard pressed by the Sabellian tribes in their rear, were easily dealt with, and after the campaign of 389 we have no further mention of an

Aequian war until the last Aequian rising in 304. The Volsci, who in 389 had advanced to Lanuvium, were met and utterly defeated by M. Furius Camillus, the conqueror of Veii, and this victory was followed up by the gradual subjugation to Rome of all the lowland country lying between the hills and the sea as far south as Tarracina. Latin colonies were established at Satricum (385), at Setia (379), and at Antium and Tarracina some time before 348. In 358 two fresh Roman tribes (Pomp-tina and Publilia) were formed in the same district. ^[108.]

Rome had now nothing more to fear from the foes who a century ago had threatened her very existence. The lowland country, of which she was the natural centre, from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina, was quiet, and within its limits Rome was by far the strongest power. But she had now to reckon with the old and faithful allies to whose loyal aid her present position was largely due. The Latins and Hernicans had suffered severely in the Aequian and Volscian wars; it is probable that not a few of the smaller communities included in the league had either been destroyed or been absorbed by larger states, and the independence of all alike was threatened by the growing power of Rome. The sack of Rome by the Celts gave them an opportunity of reasserting their independence, and we are consequently told that this disaster was immediately followed by the temporary dissolution of the confederacy, and this again a few years later by a series of actual conflicts between Rome and her former allies. Between 383 and 358 we hear of wars with Tibur, Prseneste, Tusculum, Lanuvium, Circeii, and the Hernici. But in all Rome was successful. In 382 Tusculum was fully incorporated with the Roman state by the bestowal of the full franchise ^[109.]; in 358, according to both Livy and Polybius the old alliance was formally renewed with Latins and Hernicans. We cannot, however, be wrong in assuming that the position of the allies under the new league was far inferior to that accorded them by the treaty of Spurius Cassius. ^[110. R. G., liai. Bund,] Henceforth they were the subjects rather than the equals of Rome, a position which it is evident that they accepted much against their will, and from which they were yet to make one last effort to escape.

We have now reached the close of the first stage in Rome’s advance towards supremacy in Italy. By 343 b.c. she was already mistress both of the low country stretching from the Ciminian forest to Tarracina and Circeii and of the bordering highlands. Her own territory had largely increased. Across the Tiber the lands of Veii, Capena, and Caere were nearly all Roman, while in Latium she had carried her frontiers to Tusculum on the Alban range and to the southernmost limits of the Pomptine district. And this territory was protected by a circle of dependent allies and colonies reaching northward to Sutrium and Nepete, and southward to Sora on the upper Liris, and to Circeii on the coast. Already, too, she was beginning to be recognized as a power outside the limits of the Latin lowlands. The fame of the capture of Rome by the Celts had reached Athens, and her subsequent victories over marauding Celtic bands had given her prestige in South Italy as a bulwark against northern barbarians. In 354 she had formed her first connexions beyond the Liris by a treaty with the Samnites, and in 348 followed a far more important treaty with the great maritime state of Carthage. ^[111. R. G., R. Chronol., Rhein. Mus.,]

Rome had won her supremacy from the Ciminian forest [9:20:741]to the Liris as the champion of the comparatively civilized communities of the lowlands against the rude highland tribes which threatened to overrun them, and so, when her legions first crossed the Liris, it was in answer to an appeal from a lowland city against invaders from the hills. While she was engaged in clearing Latium of Volsci and Aequi, the Sabellian tribes of the central Apennines had rapidly spread over the southern half of the peninsula. Foremost among these tribes were the Samnites, a portion of whom had captured the Etruscan city of Capua in . 423, the Greek Cumae in 420, and had since then ruled as masters over the fertile Campanian territory. But in their new homes the conquerors soon lost all sense of relationship and sympathy with their highland brethren. They dwelt in cities, amassed wealth, and inherited the civilization of the Greeks and Etruscans whom they had dispossessed; ^[112. R. G., R. G., sq.∙, Campanien,] above all, they had before long to defend themselves in their turn against the attacks of their ruder kinsmen from the hills, and it was for aid against these that the Samnites of Campania appealed to the rising state which had already made herself known as the bulwark of the lowlands north of the Liris, and which with her Latin and Hernican allies had scarcely less interest than the Campanian cities themselves in checking the raids of the highland Samnite tribes.

The Campanian appeal was listened to. Rome with her confederates entered into alliance with Capua and the neighbouring Campanian towns, and war was formally declared (343) against the Samnites. ^[113.] While to the Latins and Hernicans was entrusted apparently the defence of Latium and the Hernicän valley against the northerly members of the Samnite confederacy, the Romans themselves undertook the task of driving the invaders out of Campania. After two campaigns the war was ended in 341 by a treaty, and the Samnites withdrew from the lowlands, leaving Rome the recognized suzerain of the Campanian cities which had sought her aid. ^[114. G., G., sq.]

There is no doubt that the check thus given by Rome to the advance of the hitherto invincible Sabellian highlanders not only made her the natural head and champion of the low countries, south as well as north of the Liris, but also considerably added to her prestige. Carthage sent her congratulations, and the Etruscan city of Falerii voluntarily enrolled herself among the allies of Rome. Of even greater service, however, was the fact that for fifteen years the Samnites remained quiet, for this inactivity, whatever its cause, enabled Rome triumphantly to surmount a danger which threatened for the moment to wreck her whole position. This danger was nothing less than a desperate effort on the part of nearly all her allies and dependents south of the Tiber to throw off the yoke of her supremacy. The way was led by her ancient confederates the Latins, whose smouldering discontent broke into open flame directly the fear of a Samnite attack was removed. From the Latin Campagna and the Sabine hills the revolt spread westward and southward to Antium and Tarracina, and even to the towns of the Campanian plain, where the mass of the inhabitants at once repudiated the alliance formed with Rome by the ruling class. The struggle was sharp but short. In two pitched battles ^[115.] the strength of the insurrection was broken, and two more campaigns sufficed for the complete reduction of such of the insurgent communities as still held out. The revolt crushed, Rome set her-

self deliberately to the task of re-establishing on a new and firmer basis her supremacy over the lowlands, and in doing so laid the foundations of that marvellous organization which was destined to spread rapidly over Italy, and to withstand the attacks even of Haunibal. The old historic Latin league ceased to exist, though its memory was still preserved by the yearly Latin festival on the Alban Mount. Most if not all of the common land of the league became Roman territory; ^[116.] five at least of the old Latin cities were compelled to accept the Roman franchise ^[117.] and enter the pale of the Roman state. The rest, with the Latin colonies, were ranked as Latin allies of Rome, but on terms which secured their complete dependence upon the sovereign city. The policy of isolation, which became so cardinal a principle of Roman rule, was now first systematically applied. No rights of “con-nubium” or “commercium” were any longer to exist between these communities. Their federal councils were prohibited, and all federal action independent of Rome forbidden. ^[118. loc. cit., “]

In future they were to have nothing in common but their common connexion with Rome, a connexion based in each case on a separate treaty between the individual Latin community and Rome. The Latin allied state retained its internal independence and the old rights of intermarriage and commerce with Rome, but it lost all freedom of action in external affairs. It could wage no wars, conclude no treaties, and was bound, so the phrase ran, to have always the same foes and friends as Rome herself. In Campania and the coast-lands connecting Campania with Rome, a policy of annexation was considered safer than that of alliance. Of the two frontier posts of the Volsci, Antium and Velitrae, the former was constituted a Roman colony, its long galleys burnt and their prows set up in the Forum at Rome, while the walls of Velitrae were razed to the ground, its leading men banished beyond the Tiber, and their lands given to Roman settlers. Farther south on the route to Campania, Fundi and Formiae were, after the precedent set in the case of Caere, declared Roman and granted the civil rights of Roman citizenship, while lastly in Campania itself the same status was given to Capua, Cumae, and the smaller communities dependent upon them. ^[119. Ital. Fund, sq. Campanien, Comment. Epigraph.,] During the ten years from 338 to 328 the work of settlement was steadily continued. Tarracina, like Antium, was made a Roman colony. Privernum, the last Volscian town to offer resistance to Rome, was subdued in 330, part of its territory allotted to Roman citizens, and the state itself forced to accept the Roman ’franchise. Lastly, to strengthen the lines of defence against the Sabellian tribes, two colonies with the rights of Latin allies were established at Fregellae and at Cales. The settlement of the lowlands was accomplished. From the Ciminian forest to the southern extremity of the Campanian plain, the lands lying between the sea and the hills were now, with few exceptions, Roman territory, while along the frontiers from Sutrium and Nepete in the north to Cales in the south stretched the protecting line of the Latin allied states and colonies. As a single powerful and compact state with an outer circle of closely dependent allies, Rome now stood in sharp contrast with the disunited and degenerate cities of northern Etruria, the loosely organized tribes of the Apennines, and the decaying and disorderly’Greek towns of the south.
[9:20:742]

The strength of this system was now to be tried by a struggle with the one Italian people who were still ready and able to contest with Rome the supremacy of the peninsula. The passive attitude of the Samnites between 342 and 327 was no doubt largely due to the dangers which had suddenly threatened them in South Italy. But the death of Alexander of Epirus, in 332, ^[120.] removed∣ their only formidable opponent there, and left them free to turn their attention to the necessity of checking the steady advance of Rome. In 327, the year after the ominous foundation of a Roman colony at Fregellae, a pretext for renewing the struggle was offered them. The Cumaean colony of Palaepolis ^[121.] had incurred the wrath of Rome by its raids into her territory in Campania. The Samnites sent a force to defend it, and Rome replied by a declaration of war. The two opponents were not at first sight unequally matched, and had the Sabellian tribes held firmly together the issue of the struggle might have been different. As it was, however, the Lucanians to the south actually joined Rome from the first, while the northern clans Marsi, Vestini, Paeligni, Erentani, after a feeble and lukewarm resistance, subsided into a neutrality which was exchanged in 304 for a formal alliance with Rome. An even greater advantage to Rome from the outset was the enmity existing between Samnites and the Apulians, the latter of whom from the first joined Rome and thus gave her a position in the rear of her enemy and in a country eminently well fitted for maintaining a large military force. These weaknesses on the Samnite side were amply illustrated by the events of the war.

The first seven or eight years were marked by one serious disaster to the Roman arms, the defeat at the Caudine Forks (321), but, when in 318 the Samnites asked for and obtained a two years’ truce, Rome had succeeded not only in inflicting several severe blows upon her enemies but in isolating them from outside help. The Lucanians to the south were her allies. To the east, in the rear of Samnium, Apulia acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and Luceria, captured in 320, had been established as a base of Roman operations. Finally to the north the Romans had easily overcome the feeble resistance of the Vestini and Frentani, and secured through their territories a safe passage for their legions to Apulia. On the renewal of hostilities in 316, the Samnites, bent on escaping from the net which was being slowly drawn round them, made a series of desperate efforts to break through the lines of defence which protected Latium and Campania. Sora and Fregellae on the upper Liris were captured by a sudden attack; the Ausones in the low country near the mouth of the same river were encouraged to revolt by the appearance of the Samnite army; and in Campania another army, attracted by rumours of disturbance, all but defeated the Roman consuls under the very walls of Capua. But these efforts were unavailing. Sora and Fregellae were recovered as quickly as they had been lost, and the frontier there was strengthened by the establishment of a colony at Interamna. The Ausones were punished by the confiscation of their territory, and Roman supremacy further secured by the two colonies of Suessa and Pontia (312). The construction of the famous Via Appia, ^[122.] the work of the censor Appius Claudius Caecus, opened a safe and direct route to Campania, while the capture of Nola deprived the Samnites of their last important stronghold in the Campanian lowlands. The failure of these attempts broke the courage even of the Samnites. Their hopes were indeed raised for a moment by the news that Etruria had risen against Rome (310), but their daring scheme of effecting a union with the Etruscans was frustrated by the energy of the Roman generals. Five years later (305) the Romans revenged a Samnite raid into Campania by an invasion of Samuium itself. Arpinum on the frontier was taken, and at last, after a twenty-two years’ struggle, the Second Samnite War was closed by a renewal of the ancient treaty with Rome (304). ^[123.]

The six years of peace which followed (304-298) were characteristically employed by Rome in still further strengthening her position. Already, two years before the peace, a rash revolt of the Hernici ^[124.] had given Rome a pretext for finally annexing the territory of her ancient allies. The tribal confederacy was broken up, and all the Hernican communities, with the exception of three which had not joined the revolt, were incorporated with the Roman state as municipia, with the civil rights of the Roman franchise. Between the Hernican valley and the frontiers of the nearest Sabellian tribes lay what remained of the once formidable people of the Aequi. In their case, too, a revolt (304) was followed by the annexation of their territory, which was marked in this case by the formation there (301) of two Roman tribes (Aniensis and Teretina). ^[125.] Not content with thus carrying the borders of their own territory up to the very frontiers of the Sabellian country, Rome succeeded in finally detaching from the Sabellianconfederacyall the tribes lying ^[126.] between the north-east frontier of Latium and the Adriatic Sea. Henceforward the Marsi, Paeligni, Vestini, Marrucini, and Frentani were enrolled among the allies of Rome, and not only swelled her forces in the field but interposed a useful barrier between her enemies to the north in Etruria and Umbria and those to the south in Samnium, while they connected her directly with the friendly Apulians. Lastly, as a security for the fidelity at least of the nearest of these allies, colonies were planted in the Marsian territories at Carseoli and at Alba Fucentia. A significant indication of the widening range of Rome’s influence in Italy, and of the new responsibilities rapidly pressing upon her, is the fact that when in 302 the Spartan Cleonymus landed in the territory of the Sallentini, far away in the south-east, he was met and repulsed by a Roman force. ^[127.]

Six years after the conclusion of the treaty which ended the Second Samnite AVar, news arrived that the Samnites were harassing the Lucanians. Rome at once interfered to protect her allies. Samnium was invaded in force, the country ravaged, and one stronghold after another captured. Unable any longer to hold their own in a position where they were hedged round by enemies, the Samnite leaders turned as a last hope to the communities of northern Etruria, to the free tribes of Umbria, and to the once dreaded Celts. With a splendid daring they formed the scheme of uniting all these peoples with themselves in a last desperate effort to break the power of Rome.

For some forty years after the final annexation of southern Etruria (351 b.c.) matters had remained unchanged in that quarter. Sutrium and Nepete still guarded the Roman frontier; the natural boundary of the Ciminian forest was still intact; and up the valley of the Tiber Rome had not advanced beyond Falerii, a few miles short of the most southerly Umbrian town Ocriculum. But in 311, on the expiry, apparently, of the long truce with Rome, concluded in 351, the northern Etruscans, alarmed no doubt by the rapid advances which Rome was making further south, rose in arms and attacked Sutrium. The attack, however, recoiled disastrously upon the heads of the assailants. A Roman force promptly relieved Sutrium, and its leader, Q. Fabius Rullianus, without awaiting orders from home, boldly plunged into the wilds of the Ciminian forest, and crossing them safely swept [9:20:743]with fire and sword over the rich lands to the north. Then turning southward he met and utterly defeated the forces which the Etruscans had hastily raised in the hopes of intercepting him at the Vadimonian Lake. ^[128. (R. G., sq.)] This decisive victory ended the war. The Etruscan cities, disunited among themselves, and enervated by long years of peace, abandoned the struggle for the time, paid a heavy indemnity, and concluded a truce with Rome (309-308). In the same year the promptitude of Fabius easily averted a threatened attack by the Umbrians, but Rome proceeded nevertheless to fortify herself in her invariable fashion against future dangers on this side, by an alliance with Ocriculum, which was followed ten years later by a colony at Nequinum, ^[129. r] and an alliance with the Picentes, whose position in the rear of Umbria rendered them as valuable to Rome as the Apulians had proved farther south.

Fourteen years had passed since the battle on the Vadimonian Lake, when the Samnites appeared on the borders of Etruria and called on the peoples of northern Italy to rise against the common enemy. Their appeal, backed by the presence of their troops, was successful. The Etruscans found courage to face the Roman legions once more; a few of the Umbrians joined them; but the most valuable allies to the Samnites were the Celts, who had for some time threatened a raid across the Apennines, and who now marched eagerly into Umbria and joined the coalition. The news that the Celts were in motion produced a startling effect at Rome, and every nerve was strained to meet this new danger. While two armies were left in southern Etruria as reserves, the two consuls, Fabius and Decius, both tried soldiers, marched northwards up the valley of the Tiber and into Umbria at the head of four Roman legions and a still larger force of Italian allies. At Sentinum, on the further side of the Apennines, they encountered the united forces of the Celts and Samnites, the Etruscans and Umbrians having, it is said, been withdrawn for the defence of their own homes. The battle that followed was desperate, and the Romans lost one of their consuls, Decius, and more than 8000 men. ^[130.] But the Roman victory was decisive. The Celts were annihilated, and the fear of a second Celtic attack on Rome removed. All danger from the coalition was over. The Etruscan communities gladly purchased peace by the payment of indemnities. The rising in Umbria, never formidable, died away, and the Samnites were left single-handed to bear the whole weight of the wrath of Rome. During four years more, however, they desperately defended their highland homes, and twice at least, in 293 and 292, they managed to place in the field a force sufficient to meet the Roman legions on equal terms. At last, in 290, the consul M. Curius Dentatus finally exhausted their power of resistance. Peace was concluded, and it is significant of the respect inspired at Rome by their indomitable courage that they were allowed to become the allies of Rome, on equal terms and without any sacrifice of independence. ^[131. Epit., Tenmatum]

Between the close of the Third Samnite War and the landing of Pyrrhus in 281 B.c. λve find Rome engaged, as her wont was, in quietly extending and consolidating her power. In southern Italy she strengthened her hold on Apulia by planting on the borders of Apulia and Lucania the strong colony of Venusia. ^[132. Exc.,] In central Italy the annexation of the Sabine country (290) carried her frontiers eastward to the borders of her Picentine allies on the Adriatic. ^[133. Epit.,] Farther east, in the territory of the

Picentes themselves, she established colonies on the Adriatic coast at IIatria and Castrum (285-283). ^[134. Eρit.,] By these measures her control of central Italy from sea to sea was secured, and an effectual barrier interposed between her possible enemies in the north and those in the south. North of the Picentes lay the territories of the Celtic Senones, stretching inland to the north-east borders of Etruria, and these too now fell into her hands. Ten years after their defeat at Sentinum (285-284) a Celtic force descended into Etruria, besieged Arretium, and defeated the relieving force despatched by Rome. In 283 the consul L. Cornelius Dolabella was sent to avenge the insult. He completely routed the Senones. Their lands were annexed by Rome, and a colony established at Sena on the coast. This success, followed as it was by the decisive defeat of the neighbouring tribe of the Boii, who had invaded Etruria and penetrated as far south as the Vadimonian Lake, awed the Celts into quiet, and for more than forty years there was comparative tranquillity in northern Italy. ^[135. Epit.,]

In the south, however, the claims of Rome to supremacy were now to be disputed by a new and formidable foe. At the close of the Third Samnite War the Greek cities on the southern coast of Italy found themselves once more harassed by the Sabellian tribes on their borders, whose energies, no longer absorbed by the long struggles in central Italy, now found an attractive opening southward. Naturally enough the Greeks, like the Capuans sixty years before, appealed for aid to Rome (283-282), and like the Capuans they offered in return to recognize the suzerainty of the great Latin republic. In reply a Roman force under C. Fabricius marched into South Italy, easily routed the marauding bands of Lucanians, Bruttians, and Samnites, and established Roman garrisons in Locri. Croton, Rhegium, and Thurii. At Tarentum, the most powerful and flourishing of the Greek seaports, this sudden and rapid advance of Rome excited the greatest anxiety. . Tarentum was already allied by treaty (301) with Rome, and she had now to decide whether this treaty should be exchanged for one which would place her, like the other Greek communities, under the protectorate of Rome, or whether she should find some ally able and willing to assist in making a last stand for independence. The former course, in Tarentum, as before at Capua, was the one favoured by the aristocratic party; the latter was eagerly supported by the mass of the people and their leaders. While matters were still in suspense, the appearance, contrary to . the treaty, of a Roman squadron off the harbour decided the controversy. The Tarentines, indignant at the insult, attacked the hostile fleet, killed the admiral, and sunk most of the ships. Still Rome, relying probably on her partisans in the city, tried negotiation, and an alliance appeared likely after all, when suddenly the help for which the Tarentine democrats had been looking appeared, and war with Rome was resolved upon (281-280). ^[136. EpU., Pyrrh.,]

King Pyrrhus, whose timely appearance seemed for the moment to have saved the independence of Tarentum, was the most brilliant of the military adventurers whom the disturbed times following the death of Alexander the Great had brought into prominence. High-spirited, generous, and ambitious, he had formed the scheme of rivalling Alexander’s achievements in the East, by winning for himself an empire in the West. He aspired not only to unite under his rule the Greek communities of Italy and Sicily, but to overthrow the great Phoenician state of Carthage—the natural enemy of Greeks in the West, as Persia had been in the East. Of Rome it is clear that he [9:20:744]knew little or nothing; the task of ridding the Greek seaports of their barbarian foes he no doubt regarded as an easy one; and the splendid force he brought with him was intended rather for the conquest of the West than for the preliminary work of chastising a few Italian tribes, or securing the submission of the Unwarlike Italian Greeks. Pyrrhus’s first measure was to place Tarentum under a strict military discipline; this done he advanced into Lucania to meet the Roman consul Laevinus. The battle which followed, on the banks of the Liris, ended in the complete defeat of the Roman troops, largely owing to the panic caused by the elephants which Pyrrhus had brought with him (280). ^[137. X. H.,] The Greek cities expelled their Roman garrisons and joined him, while numerous bands of Samnites, Lucauians, and Bruttians flocked to his standard. But, to the disappointment of his Greek and Italian allies, Pyrrhus showed no anxiety to follow up the advantage he had gained. His heart was set on Sicily and Africa, and his immediate object was to effect such an arrangement with Rome as would at once fulfil the pledges he had given to the Greeks by securing them against Roman interference and set himself free to seek his fortunes westward. But, though his favourite minister Cineas employed all his skill to win the ear of the senate, and, though Pyrrhus himself lent weight to his envoy’s words by advancing as near Rome as Anagnia (279), nothing could shake the resolution of the senate, and Cineas brought back the reply that the Romans could not treat with Pyrrhus so long as he remained in arms upon Italian soil. Disappointed in his hopes of peace, Pyrrhus in the next year (278) turned his forces against the Roman strongholds in Apulia. ^[138. Pyrrh.] Once more, at Ascu-lum, he routed the legions, but only to find that the indomitable resolution of the enemy was strengthened by defeat. Weary of a struggle which threatened indefinitely to postpone the fulfilment of his dreams of empire, Pyrrhus resolved to quit Italy, and, leaving garrisons in the Greek towns, crossed into Sicily. Here his success at first was such as promised the speedy realization of his hopes. The Sicilian Greeks hailed him as a deliverer; the Carthaginians were driven back to the extreme west of the island, and Eryx and Panormus fell into his hands. But at this point fortune deserted him. His efforts to take Lilybaeum were fruitless; the Carthaginians recovered their courage, while the unstable Greeks, easily daunted by the first threatenings of failure, and impatient of the burdens of war, broke out into open murmurs against him. Soured and disappointed, Pyrrhus returned to Italy (276) to find the Roman legions steadily moving southwards, and his Italian allies disgusted by his desertion of their cause. One of the consuls for the year (275), M. Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of Samnium, was encamped at Beneventum awaiting the arrival of his colleague. Here Pyrrhus attacked him, and the closing battle of the war was fought. It ended in the complete victory of the Romans. Pyrrhus, unable any longer to face his opponents in the field, and disappointed of all assistance from his allies, retreated in disgust to Tarentum and thence crossed into Greece. ^[139. Epit., Pyrrh.,]

A few years later (272) Tarentum was surrendered to Rome by its Epirot garrison; it was granted a treaty of alliance, but its walls were razed and its fleet handed over to Rome. In 270 Rhegium also entered the ranks of Roman allies, and finally in 269 a single campaign crushed the last efforts at resistance in Samnium. Rome was now at leisure to consolidate the position she had won. Between 273 and 263 three new colonies were founded in Samnium and Lucania—Paestum in 273, Beneventum in

268, Aesernia in 263. In central Italythe area of Roman territory was increased by the full enfranchisement (268) of the Sabines, ^[140.] and of their neighbours to the east, the Picentes. To guard the Adriatic coast colonies were established at Ariminum (268), at Firmum, and at Castrum Xovum (264), while to the already numerous maritime colonies was added that of Cosa in Etruria. ^[141. Epit., Otal. Band, loc. cit., Epit., cf. II.,]

Rome was now the undisputed mistress of Italy. The limits of her supremacy to the north were represented roughly by a line drawn across the peninsula from the mouth of the Arno on the west to that of the Aesis on the east. ^[142. R. O., Ital. Landeskunde,] Beyond this line lay the Ligurians and the Celts; all south of it was now united as “Italy” under the rule of Rome.

But the rule of Rome over Italy, like her wider rule over the Mediterranean coasts, was not an absolute dominion over conquered subjects. It was in form at least a confederacy under Roman protection and guidance; and the Italians, like the provincials, were not the subjects, but the “allies and friends” of the Roman people. ^[143. Ital. Bund, CL,] Marvellous as are the perseverance and skill with which Rome built up, consolidated, and directed this confederacy, it is yet clear that both her success in forming it and its stability when formed were due in part to other causes than Roman valour and policy. The disunion which, in former times, had so often weakened the Italians in their struggles with Rome still told in her favour, and rendered the danger of a combined revolt against her authority remote in the extreme. In some cases, and especially in the city states of Etruria, Campania, and Magna Graecia, where the antagonism of the two political parties, aristocrats and democrats, was keen, Rome found natural and valuable allies in the former. Among the more backward peoples of central Italy, the looseness of their political organization not only lessened their power of resistance, but enabled Rome either to detach tribe after tribe from the confederacy or to attack and crush them singly. Elsewhere she was aided by ancient feuds, such as those between Samnites and Apulians, or Tarentines and Iapygians, or by the imminent dread of a foe—Celt, or Samnite, or Lucanian—whom Roman aid alone could repel. And, while combination against her was thus rendered difficult, if not impossible, by internal dissensions, feuds, differences of interest, of race, of language, and habits, Rome herself, from her position in the centre of Italy, was so placed as to be able to strike promptly, on the first signs of concerted opposition. All these advantages Rome utilized to the utmost. We have no means of deciding how far she applied elsewhere the principle upon which she acted in northern Etruria and Campania, of attaching the aristocratic party in a community to Roman interests, by the grant of special privileges; but it is certain that she endeavoured by every means in her power to perpetuate, and even to increase, the disunion which she had found so useful among her allies. In every possible way she strove to isolate them from each other, while binding them closely to herself. The old federal groups were in most cases broken up, and each of the members united with Rome by a special treaty of alliance. In Etruria, Latium, Campania, and Magna Graecia the city state was taken as the unit; in central Italy, where urban life was non-existent, the unit was the tribe. The northern Sabellian peoples, for instance,—the Marsi, Paeligni, Vestini, Marrucini, Frentani,—were now [9:20:745]constituted as separate communities in alliance with Rome. In many cases, too, no freedom of trade or intermarriage was allowed between the allies themselves, a policy afterwards systematically pursued in the provinces. Nor were all these numerous allied communities placed on the same footing as regarded their relations with Rome herself. To begin with, a sharp distinction was drawn between the “Latini” and the general mass of Italian allies. The “Latins” of this period had little more than the name in common with the old thirty Latin peoples of the days of Spurius Cassius. With a few exceptions, such as Tibur and Praeneste, the latter had either disappeared or had been incorporated with the Roman state, and the Latins of 268 B.c. were almost exclusively the “Latin colonies,” that is to say, communities founded by Rome, composed of men of Roman blood, and whose only claim to the title “Latin” lay in the fact that Rome granted to them some portion of the rights and privileges formerly enjoyed by the old Latin cities under the Cassian treaty. ^[144. sq.] Though nominally allies, they were in fact offshoots of Rome herself, bound to her by community of race, language, and interest, and planted as Roman garrisons among alien and conquered peoples. The Roman citizen who joined a Latin colony lost his citizenship,—to have allowed him to retain it would no doubt have been regarded as enlarging too rapidly the limits of the citizen body; but he received in exchange the status of a favoured ally. The Latin colony did not indeed enjoy the equality and independence originally possessed by the old Latin cities. It had no freedom of action outside its own territory, could not make war or peace, and was bound to have the same friends and foes as Rome. But its members had the right of commercium and down to 268 ^[145. Pro Caee., B. G., Staatsverw.,] of connubium also with Roman citizens. Provided they left sons and property to represent them at home, they were free to migrate to Rome and acquire the Roman franchise. In war time they not only shared in the booty, but claimed a portion of any land confiscated by Rome and declared “public.” These privileges, coupled with their close natural affinities with Rome, successfully secured the fidelity of the Latin colonies, which became not only the most efficient props of Roman supremacy, but powerful agents in the work of Romanizing Italy. Below the privileged Latins stood the Italian allies; and here again we know generally that there were considerable differences of status, determined in each case by the terms of their respective treaties with Rome. We are told that the Greek cities of Neapolis and Heraclea were among the most favoured; ^[146. Cαmp., Pfo Balbo,] the Bruttii, on the other hand, seem, even before the Hannibalic war, to have been less generously treated. But beyond this the absence of all detailed information does not enable us to gθ∙ ...

Rome, however, did not rely only on this policy of isola tion. Her allies were attached as closely to herself as they were clearly separated from each other, and from the first she took every security for the maintenance of her own paramount authority. Within its own borders, each ally was left to manage its own affairs as an independent state. ^[147. R. G., Ital. Bund,] The badges which marked subjection to Rome in the provinces—the resident magistrate and the tribute—were unknown in Italy. But in all points affecting the relations of one ally with another, in all questions of the general interests of Italy and of foreign policy, the decision rested solely with Rome. The place of a federal constitution, of a federal council, of federal officers, was filled by the Roman senate, assembly, and magistrates. The maintenance of peace and order in Italy, the defence of the coasts and frontiers, the making of war or peace with foreign powers, were matters the settlement of which Rome kept entirely in her own hands. Each allied state, in time of war, was called upon for a certain contingent of men, but, though its contingent usually formed a distinct corps under officers of its own, its numerical strength was fixed by Rome, it was brigaded with the Roman legions, and was under the orders of the Roman consul. ^[148.]

This paramount authority of Rome throughout the peninsula was confirmed and justified by the fact that Rome herself was now infinitely more powerful than any one of her numerous allies. Her territory, as distinct from that of the allied states, covered something like one-third of the peninsula south of the Aesis. Along the west coast it stretched from Caere to the southern borders of Campania. Inland, it included the former territories of the Aequi and Hernici, the Sabine country, and even extended eastward into Picenum, while beyond these limits were outlying districts, such as the lands of the Senonian Celts, with the Roman colony of Sena, and others elsewhere in Italy, which had been confiscated by Rome and given over to Roman settlers. Since the first important annexation of territory after the capture of Veii (396), twelve new tribes had been formed, ^[149.] and the number of male citizens registered at the census had risen from 152,000 to 290,OOO. ^[150. Eρit., R. G., sq.] Within this enlarged Roman state were now included numerous communities with local institutions and government. At their head stood the Roman colonies (“coloniae civium Romanorum ”), founded to guard especially the coasts of Latium and Canqjania. ^[151.] Next to these eldest children of Rome came those communities which had been invested with the full Roman franchise, such, for instance, as the old Latin towns of Aricia, Lanuvium, Tusculum, Nomentum, and Pedum. Lowest in the scale were those which had riot been considered ripe for the full franchise, but had, like Caere, received instead the “civitas sine suffragio,” the civil without the political rights. ^[152.] Their members, though Roman citizens, were not enrolled in the tribes, and in time of war served not in the ranks of the Roman legions but in separate contingents. In addition to these organized town communities, there were also the groups of Roman settlers on the public lands, and the dwellers in the village communities of the enfranchised highland districts in central Italy.

The administrative needs of this enlarged Rome were obviously such as could not be adequately satisfied by the system which had done well enough fur a small city state with a few square miles of territory. The old centralization of all government in Rome itself had become an impossibility, and the Roman statesmen did their best to meet the altered requirements of the time. The urban communities within the Roman pale, colonies and muni[9:20:746]cipia, were allowed a large measure of local self-government. In all we find local assemblies, senates, and magistrates, to whose hands the ordinary routine of local administration was confided, and, in spite of differences in detail, e.g., in the titles and numbers of the magistrates, the same type of constitution prevailed throughout. ^[153. Ital. Bund,] But these local authorities were carefully subordinated to the higher powers in Rome. The local constitution could be modified or revoked by the Roman senate and assembly, aud the local magistrates, no less than the ordinary members of the community, were subject to the paramount authority of the Roman consuls, praetors, and censors. In particular, care was taken to keep the administration of justice well under central control. The Roman citizen in a colony or municipium enjoyed of course the right of appeal to the Roman people in a capital case. We may also assume that from the first some limit was placed to the jurisdiction of the local magistrate, and that cases falling outside it came before the central authorities. But

. an additional safeguard for the equitable and uniform administration of Roman law, in communities to many of which the Roman code was new and unfamiliar, was provided by the institution of prefects (“praefecti juri dicundo”), ^[154. R. G., Rom. Staatsrecht,] who were sent out annually, as representatives of the Roman praetor, to administer j ustice in the colonies and municipia. To prefects was, moreover, assigned the charge of those districts within the Roman pale where no urban communities, and consequently no organized local government, existed. In these two institutions, that of municipal government and that of prefectures, we have already two of the cardinal points of the later imperial system of government.

A word must lastly be said of the changes which the altered position and increased responsibilities of Rome had effected in her military system. ^[155. R. G., Verfi R. Reichs, sq.;] For the most part these changes tended gradually to weaken the old and intimate connexion between the Roman army in the field and the Roman people at home, and thus prepared the ιvay for that complete breach between the two which in the end proved fatal to the republic. It is true that service in the legion was still the first duty and the highest privilege of the fully qualified citizen. Every “assiduus” was still liable to active military service between the ages of seventeen to forty-five, and “proletarii” aud freedmen were still called out only in great emergencies, ^[156. E.g.,] and then but rarely enrolled in the legions. But this service was gradually altering in character. Though new legions were still raised each year for the summer campaigns, this was by no means always accompanied, as formerly, by the disbandment of those already on foot, and this increase in the length of time during which the citizen was kept with the standards had, as early as the siege of Veii, necessitated a further deviation from the old theory of military service—the introduction of pay. ^[157.] Hardly less important than these changes were those which had taken place in the organization of the legion itself. In the early days of the republic the same divisions served for the soldier in the legion and the citizen in the assembly. The Roman army in the field, and the Roman people in the comitia on the Campus, were alike grouped according to their wealth, in classes and centuriae. But by the time of the Latin war the arrangement of the legion had been wholly altered. In the new manipular system, with its three lines, no regard was paid to civic distinctions, but only to length of service and military efficiency, while at the same time the more open order of fighting which it involved demanded of each soldier greater skill, and therefore a more thorough training in arms thau the old phalanx. One other change resulted from the new military necessities of the time, which was as fruitful of results as the incipient separation between the citizen and the soldier. The citizen soldiers of early Rome were commanded in the field by the men whom they had chosen to be their chief magistrates at home, and still, except when a dictator was appointed, the chief command of the legions rested with the consuls of the year. But, as Rome’s military operations increased in area and in distance from Rome, a larger staff became necessary, and the inconvenience of summoning home a consul in the field from an unfinished campaign became intolerable. The remedy found, that of prolonging for a further period the imperium of the consul, was first applied in 327 b.c. in the case of Q. Publilius Philo, ^[158.] and between 327 and 264 instances of this “prorogatio imperii” became increasingly common. This proconsular authority, originally an occasional and subordinate one, was destined to become first of all the strongest force in the republic, and ultimately the chief prop of the power of the Caesars. Already, within the limits of Italy, Rome had laid the foundation stones of the system by which she afterwards governed the world,—the municipal constitutions, the allied states, the proconsuls, and the prefects.

Period II: Rome and the Mediterranean States, 265-146 B.c.—(α) Conquest ofi the West.— Though marked out by her geographical position as the natural centre of the Mediterranean, Italy had hitherto played no active part in Mediterranean politics, but, now that she was for the first time united, it was felt throughout the Mediterranean world that a new power had arisen, and Rome, as the head and representative of Italy, found herself irresistibly drawn into the vortex of Mediterranean affairs. With those of the eastern Mediterranean indeed she was not immediately called upon to concern herself. Her repulse of Pyrrhus, and the news that the Greek cities of South Italy had acknowledged her suzerainty, had, it is true, suddenly revealed to the Eastern world the existence of a powerful Italian state. Egypt sought her alliance, and Greek scholars began to interest themselves keenly in the history, constitution, and character of the Latin republic which had so suddenly become famous. But this was all, and not until fifty years after the retreat of Pyrrhus did Rome seriously turn her attention eastward. Westward of Italy the case was different. The western coasts of the peninsula were the most fertile and populous and wealthy, and it was westward rather than eastward that the natural openings for Italian commerce were to be found. But it was precisely on this side that Rome had serious ground for anxiety. Carthage was now at the height of her power. Her outposts were threateningly near to Italy in Sardiuia and in Sicily, while her fleets swept the seas and jealously guarded for the benefit of Carthage alone the hidden treasures of the West. In the east of Sicily, Syracuse still upheld the cause of Greek independence against the hereditary foe of the Greek race; but Syracuse stood alone, and her resources were comparatively small. What Rome had to fear was the establishment, and that at no distant date, of an absolute Carthaginian domination over the Western seas—a domination which would not only be fatal to Italian commerce but would be a standing menace to the safety of the Italian coasts. Rome had indeed long been [9:20:747]connected with Carthage by treaty, and the older purely commercial treaties had quite recently been replaced by a close alliance formed in face of the common danger to which both had been exposed by the adventurous schemes of Pyrrhus. But this danger was past, and it is probable that others besides Pyrrhus foresaw that on the old battleground of Greeks and Phoenicians a struggle must soon be fought out between the Phoenician mistress of the Italian seas and the rulers of the Italian peninsula.

It was above all things essential for Rome that the Carthaginians should advance no farther eastward. But already in 272 Tarentum had almost fallen into their grasp, and seven years later Rome was threatened with a danger at least as serious, the establishment of Carthaginian rule in the east of Sicily, and within sight of the Italian coast. In 265 a body of Campanian mercenaries, who had seized Messana, found themselves hard pressed by Hiero, king of Syracuse. One party among them appealed for aid to Carthage. The Carthaginians readily responded, and a Carthaginian garrison occupied the citadel of Messana. But at Messana, as once at Tarentum, there were others who turned to Rome, and, as Italians themselves, implored the aid of the great Italian republic, offering in return to place Messana under the suzerainty of Rome. The request was a perplexing one. Both Hiero and the Carthaginians were allies of Rome, and Messana, if rescued from the latter, belonged of right to Hiero and not to Rome. Apart, too, from treaty obligations, the Roman senate naturally hesitated before acceding to an appeal which would precipitate a collision with Carthage, and commit Rome to a new and hazardous career of enterprise beyond the sea. Finally, however, all other considerations gave way before the paramount importance of checking the advance of Carthage. The Roman assembly voted that assistance should be sent to the Mamertines, and in 264 the Roman legions for the first time crossed the sea. Messana was occupied, and, after sustaining a defeat, the Carthaginians and Syracusans were forced to raise the siege and withdraw. The opening years of the war which was thus begun gave little promise of the length of the struggle, and it seemed likely at the outset that Rome’s immediate object, the expulsion of the Carthaginians from Sicily, would be soon attained. The accession to the Roman side of King Hiero (263) not only confirmed the position which Rome had already assumed in Italy of the champion of the western Greeks against barbarians, but provided her in eastern Sicily with a convenient base of operations and commodious winter quarters, and in Hiero himself with a loyal and effective ally. In the next year (262) followed the capture of Agrigentum, and in 261 the Roman senate resolved on supplementing these successes on land by the formation of a fleet which should not only enable them to attack the maritime strongholds which defied the assaults of their legions, and protect their own coasts, but even to carry the war into Africa itself. In the spring of 260 the first regular Roman fleet, consisting of one hundred quinqueremes and twenty triremes set sail; ^[159. R. O.,] and the brilliant naval victory off Mylae, won by the consul C. Duilius in the same year, seemed to promise the Romans as much success by sea as they had won by land. But the promise was not fulfilled; and in 256 the senate, impatient of the slow progress made in Sicily, determined on boldly invading Africa. It was a policy for which, if Africa were once reached, the defenceless state of the Carthaginian territories, the doubtful loyalty of her Libyan subjects, and the Unwarlike habits of her own citizens, gave every hope of success, and, but for the blunders of the Romans themselves, it might have succeeded now as it did fifty years later. The passage to Africa was opened by the defeat of the Carthaginian fleet off Ecnomus; the two consuls, L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus, landed in safety and rapidly overran the country. But these successes led the senate, at the close of the summer, into committing the serious blunder of recalling one of the consuls, Manlius, with a large portion of the troops. It was one of many instances in which the rules and traditions of the old republican system proved themselves inconsistent with the new requirements of an extended warfare. The consul came back to hold the elections; his soldiers returned, as the custom had been, to their homes after a summer’s campaign; but the efficiency of the expedition was fatally impaired. The rashness and over-confidence of Regulus aggravated the effects of the senate’s action. Emboldened by further successes, and notwithstanding his diminished forces, he met the Carthaginian proposals for peace by terms so harsh that the latter, though the Romans were almost at their gates, their soldiers disheartened, and the nomad tribes swarming on their frontiers, indignantly broke off the negotiations and prepared to resist to the last. At this crisis, so the story runs, the arrival of Xanthippus, a Spartan soldier of fortune, changed the face of affairs, as that of Gylippus had formerly done at Syracuse. His superior military skill remedied the blunders of the Carthaginian generals; confidence was restored; and in 255 he triumphantly routed the Roman forces a few i miles outside the city. Regulus was taken prisoner, ^[160. Weltgeschichte, Cf.] and only a miserable remnant of two thousand men escaped to the Roman camp on the coast. Here they were rescued by a Roman fleet, but their ill-fortune pursued them. On its way home the fleet was wrecked, and all but 80 vessels out of a total of 364 were lost.

Still, though abandoning all thoughts of invading Africa, the Romans were unwilling to renounce all thoughts of facing their enemy on the sea. But fresh disasters followed. The hopes raised (254) by the capture of £ Panormus were dashed to the ground the next year (253) £ by the total destruction in a storm of the victorious fleet on its way home from Panormus to Rome. Four years later a second fleet, despatched under P. Claudius to assist in the blockade of Lilybaeum, was completely defeated off Drepana, while, to make matters worse, his colleague L. Junius, who had been hastily sent out with reinforcements, was wrecked near the dangerous promontory of Pachynus.

Disheartened by these repeated disasters, the senate resolved to trust only to the legions, and by sheer force of perseverance slowly to force the enemy out of the few positions to which he still clung in Sicily. But, though for five years (248-243) no fresh naval operations were £ attempted, no compensating success by land followed. Hamilcar Barca, the new Carthaginian commander, not only ravaged with his fleet the coasts of Italy, but from his impregnable position at Ercte incessantly harassed the Roman troops in the west of the island, and even recaptured Eryx. Convinced once more of the impossibility of driving the Carthaginians out of Sicily as long as their navy swept the seas, the Romans determined on a final effort. The treasury was empty; but by the liberal contributions of private citizens a fleet was equipped, and C. Lutatius Catulus, consul for 242, started for Sicily early 5 in the summer of that year with 200 quinqueremes. From Drepana, whither he had gone to aid in the blockade, he sailed out to meet a Carthaginian fleet, despatched from Africa against him; and a battle took place at the Aegates islands, some 20 miles from the Sicilian coast, in which Catulus completely defeated his enemy. The end [9:20:748]of the long struggle had come at last. The Carthaginian government, despairing of being able to send further aid to their troops in Sicily, authorized Hamilcar to treat for peace. His proposals were accepted by Catulus, and the terms agreed upon between them were confirmed in all essential points by the commissioners sent out from Rome. The Carthaginians agreed to evacuate Sicily and the adjoining islands, to restore all prisoners, and to pay an indemnity of 2300 talents.

In its duration and its severity the First Punic War is justly ranked by Polybius above all other wars of his own and preceding times, though neither in the military talent displayed nor in the importance of its results can it be compared with the war that followed. It was distinguished by no military achievement comparable with Hannibal’s invasion of Italy, and with the single exception of Hamilcar it produced no general of the calibre of Hannibal or Scipio. It was in fact a struggle in which both Rome and Carthage were serving an apprenticeship in a warfare the conditions of which were unfamiliar to both. The Roman legions were foes very unlike any against which the Carthaginian leaders had ever led their motley array of mercenaries, while Rome was called upon for the first time to fight a war across the sea, and to fight with ships against the greatest naval power of the age. The novelty of these conditions accounts for much of the vacillating and uncertain action observable on both sides, and their effect in this direction was increased by the evident doubts felt by both antagonists as to the lengths to which the quarrel should be pushed. It is possible that Hamilcar had already made up his mind that Rome must be attacked and crushed in Italy, but his government attempted nothing more than raids upon the coast. There are indications also that some in the Roman senate saw no end to the struggle but in the destruction of Carthage; yet an invasion of Africa was only once seriously attempted, and then only a halfhearted support was given to the expedition. But these peculiarities in the war served to bring out in the clearest relief the strength and the weakness of the two contending states. The chief dangers for Carthage lay obviously in the jealousy exhibited at home of her officers abroad, in the difficulty of controlling her mercenary troops, and in the ever-present possibility of disaffection among her subjects in Libya,—dangers which even the genius of Hannibal failed finally to surmount. Rome, on the other hand, was strong in the public spirit of her citizens, the fidelity of her allies, the valour and discipline of her legions. What she needed was a system which should make a better use of her splendid materials than one under which her plans were shaped from day to day by a divided senate, and executed by officers who were changed every year, and by soldiers most of whom returned home at the close of each summer’s campaign.

The interval between the First and Second Punic Wars was employed by both Rome and Carthage in strengthening their respective positions. Of the islands lying off the coast of Italy, the most important, Sicily, had fallen to Rome as the prize of the recent war. The eastern end of the island was still left under the rule of King Hiero as the ally of Rome, but the larger western portion became directly subject to Rome, and a temporary arrangement seems to have been made for its government, either by one of the two praetors, or possibly by a quaestor. ^[161. Rom. Staatsver., Ji. G., Sie., 2.] Sardinia and Corsica had not been surrendered to Rome by the treaty of 241, but three years later (238), on the invitation of the Carthaginian mercenaries stationed in the islands, a Roman force occupied them; Carthage pro-

tested, but, on the Romans threatening war, she gave way, and Sardinia and Corsica were formally ceded to Rome, though it was some seven or eight years before all resistance on the part of the natives themselves was crushed, ln 227, however, the senate considered matters ripe for the establishment of a separate and settled government, not only in Sardinia and Corsica, but also in Sicily. In that year two additional praetors were elected; to one was assigned the charge of western Sicily, to the other that of Sardinia and Corsica, ^[162. Epit.] and thus the first stones of the Roman provincial system were laid. Of at least equal importance for the security of the peninsula was the subjugation of the Celtic tribes in the valley of the Po. These, headed by the Boii and Insubres and assisted by levies from the Celts to the westward, had in 225 alarmed the whole of Italy by invading Etruria and penetrating to Clusium, only three days’ journey from Rome. Here, however, their courage seems to have failed them. They retreated northward along the Etruscan coast, until at Telamon their way was barred by the Roman legions, returning from Sardinia to the defence of Rome, while a second consular army hung upon their rear. Thus hemmed in, the Celts fought desperately, but were completely defeated and the flower of their tribesmen slain. The Romans followed up their success by invading the Celtic territory. The Boii were easily reduced to submission. The Insubres, north of the Po, resisted more obstinately, but by 222 the war was over, and all the tribes in the rich Po valley acknowledged the supremacy of Rome. The conquered Celts were not enrolled among the Italian allies of Rome, but were treated as subjects beyond the frontier. Three colonies were founded to hold them in check—Placentia and Cremona in the territory ol the Insubres, Mutina in that of the Boii; and the great northern road (Via Flaminia) was completed as far as the Celtic border at Ariminum.

On the Adriatic coast, where there was no Carthage tc be feared, and no important adjacent islands to be annexed, the immediate interests of Rome were limited to rendering the sea safe for Italian trade. It was with this object that, in 229, the first Roman expedition crossed the Adriatic, and inflicted severe chastisement on the Illyriac pirates of the opposite coast. ^[163.] But the results of the expedition did not end here, for it was the means of establishing for the first time direct political relations between Rome and the states of Greece proper, to many of which the suppression of piracy in the Adriatic was of as much importance as to Rome herself. Alliances were concluded with Corcyra, Epidamnus, and Apollonia; and embassies explaining the reasons which had brought Roman troops into Greece were sent to the Aetolians, the Achaeans, and even to Athens and Corinth. Everywhere they were well received, and the admission of the Romans to the Isthmian games ^[164.] (228) formally acknowledged them as the natural allies of the free Greek states against both barbarian tribes and foreign despots, a relationship which was destined to prove as useful to Rome in the East as it had already proved itself to be in the West.

While Rome was thus fortifying herself on all sides, Carthage had acquired a possession which promised to compensate her for the loss of Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. The genius of her greatest citizen and soldier, Hamilcar Barca, had appreciated the enormous value of the Spanish peninsula, and conceived the scheme of founding there a Carthaginian dominion which should not only add to the wealth of Carthage, but supply her with troops, and with a base of operations for that war of revenge with Rome on which his heart was set. The conquest of southern and eastern Spain, begun by Hamilcar (236-228), and carried [9:20:749]on by his kinsman Hasdrubal (228-221), was completed by his son Hannibal, who, with all his father’s genius, inherited also his father’s hatred of Rome, and by 219 the authority of Carthage had been extended as far as the Ebro. Rome had not watched this rapid advance without anxiety, but, probably owing to her troubles with the Celts, she had contented herself with stipulating (226) that Carthage should not carry her arms beyond the Ebro, so as to threaten Rome’s ancient ally, the Greek Massilia, and with securing the independence of the two nominally Greek communities, Emporiae and Saguntum, ^[165.] on the east coast.

But these precautions were of no avail against the resolute determination of Hannibal, with whom the conquest of Spain was only preliminary to an attack upon Italy, and who could not afford to leave behind him in Spain a state allied to Rome. In 219, therefore, disregarding the protests of a Roman embassy, he attacked and took Saguntum, an act which, as he had foreseen, rendered a rupture with Rome inevitable, while it set his own hands free for a further advance.

A second war with Carthage was no unlooked-for event at Rome; but the senate seems to have confidently expected that it would be waged at a distance from Italy—in Africa and in Spain, where Saguntum would have given them a convenient point of support; and to this hope they clung even after Saguntum was lost. In 218, the first year of the war, one consul, P. Cornelius Scipio, was despatched to Spain, and the other, T. Sempronius Gracchus, to Sicily, and thence to Africa. But Hannibal’s secrecy and promptitude baffled all their calculations. Leaving New Carthage early in 218, in the space of five months he crossed the Pyrenees, reached the Rhone just as Scipio arrived at Massilia on his way to Spain, passed the Alps in spite of endless difficulties and hardships, and startled Italy by descending into the plains of Cisalpine Gaul. In two battles on the Ticinus and the Trebia he defeated the forces hastily collected to bar his progress southwards; the Celtic tribes rallied to his standard; and at the beginning of the next year he prepared to realize the dream of his life and carry fire and sword into Italy itself. His own force numbered 26,000 men; the total available strength of Rome and her allies was estimated at over 700,OOO. ^[166. sq.) R. Forsch., Ital. Band,] But Hannibal’s hope lay in the possibility that by the rapidity of his movements he might be able to strike a decisive blow before Rome could mobilize her levies, or get her somewhat cumbrous military machinery into working order. From a first success he expected no less a result than the break up of the Roman confederacy, and the isolation of Rome herself, while it would also increase the readiness of his own government to render him effective support. His trust in himself and his army was not misplaced, for to the last he had the advantage over the Roman legions wherever he met them in person. Except, however, in South Italy, his brilliant victories and dashing marches brought him no allies, and it was his inability to shake the loyalty of northern and central Italy and of the Latin colonies everywhere, even more than the indomitable perseverance of Rome and the supineness of Carthage, which caused his ultimate failure.

In the spring of 217 Hannibal crossed the Apennines and marched southwards through the lowlands of eastern Etruria, the route taken before him by the Celtic hordes. In April he annihilated Flaminius and his army at the Trasimene Lake, ^[167. Fast., K G.,] and pushed on to Spoletium, only a few days’ march from Rome. But Rome was not yet his goal; from Spoletium, which had closed its gates against him, he moved rapidly eastward, ravaging the territories of Roman allies as he went, till he reached the Adriatic and the fertile lands of northern Apulia, where supplies and especially remounts for his Numidian cavalry ^[168.] were plentiful, and communication with Carthage easy, and where, moreover, he was well placed for testing the fidelity of the most recent and the least trustworthy of the Italian allies of Rome. A second victory here, on the scale of that at the Trasimene Lake, might be the signal for a general revolt against Roman rule. It was not, however, until the summer of the next year that his opportunity came. The patient tactics of Q. Fabius Cunctator had become unpopular at Rome; and the consuls of 216, L. Aemilius Paulus and M. Terentius Varro, took the field in Apulia, at the head of a larger force than Rome had yet raised, and with orders to fight and crush the daring invader. The result realized for the moment Hannibal’s highest hopes. The Roman army was annihilated at Cannae; and South Italy, with the exception of the Latin colonies and the Greek cities on the coast, came over to his side. Nor did the Roman misfortunes end here. Philip of Macedon concluded an alliance with Hannibal (215), and threatened an invasion of Italy. In the very next year Syracuse, no longer ruled by the faithful Hiero, revolted, and a Carthaginian force landed in Sicily; lastly, in 212 came the loss of the Greek cities on the south coast. But the truth of Polybius’s remark that the Romans are most to be feared when their danger is greatest was never better illustrated than by their conduct in the face of these accumulated disasters. Patiently and undauntedly they set themselves to regain the ground they had lost. Philip of Macedon was first of all forced to retire from the allied city of Apollonia which he had attacked (214), and then effectually diverted from all thoughts of an attack on Italy, by the formation of a coalition against him in Greece itself (211); Syracuse was recaptured in 212, after a lengthy siege, and Roman authority re-established in Sicily. In Italy itself the Roman commanders took advantage of Hannibal’s absence in the extreme south to reconquer northern Apulia; but their main efforts were directed to the recovery of Campania, and above all of Capua. The imminent danger of Capua, which he hg,d named as the successor of Rome in the headship of Italy, recalled Hannibal from the south, where he was besieging a Roman garrison in the citadel of Tarentum. Failing to break through the lines which enclosed it, he resolved, as a last hope of diverting the Roman legions from the devoted city, to advance on Rome itself. But his march, deeply as it impressed the imagination of his contemporaries by its audacity and promptitude, was without result. Silently and rapidly he moved along the course of the Latin Way, through the heart of the territory of Rome, to within 3 miles of the city, and even rode up with his advanced guard to the Colline gate. Yet no ally joined him; no Roman force was recalled to face him; no proposals for peace reached his camp,; and, overcome, it is said, by the unmoved confidence of his foe, he withdrew, as silently and rapidly as he had advanced, to his headquarters in the south. The fall of Capua followed inevitably (211), ^[169. L. Agr., C. 1. L., sq.] and the Roman senate saw with relief the seat of war removed to Lucania and Bruttium, and a prospect opening of some relief from the exhausting exertions of the last five years. Their hopes were quickly dashed to the ground. The [9:20:750]faithful Massiliots sent word that Hasdrubal, beaten in Spain, was marching to join Hannibal, in Italy. The anxiety at Rome was intense, and every nerve was strained to prevent the junction of the two brothers. Equally great was the relief when the news arrived that the bold march of the consul Claudius had succeeded, and that Hasdrubal had been defeated and slain on the river Metaurus (207). The war in Italy was now virtually ended, for, though during four years more Hannibal stood at bay in a corner of Bruttium, he was powerless to prevent the restoration of Roman authority throughout the peninsula. Sicily was once more secure; and finally in 206, the year after the victory on the Metaurus, the successes of the young P. Scipio in Spain (211-206) were crowned by the complete expulsion of the Carthaginians from the peninsula. Nothing now remained to Carthage outside Africa but the ground on which Hannibal desperately held out, and popular opinion at Rome warmly supported Scipio when on his return from Spain he eagerly urged an immediate invasion of Africa. The senate hesitated. Many were jealous of Scipio’s fame, and resented his scarcely concealed intention of appealing to the people, should the senate decline his proposals. Others, like the veteran Q. Fabius, thought the attempt hazardous, with exhausted resources, and while Hannibal was still on Italian soil. But Scipio gained the day. He was elected consul for 205, and given the province of Sicily, with permission to cross into Africa if he thought fit. Voluntary contributions of men, money, and supplies poured in to the support of the popular hero; and by the end of 205 Scipio had collected in Sicily a sufficient force for his purpose. In 201 he crossed to Africa, where he was welcomed by the Numidian prince Masinissa, whose friendship he had made in Spain. In 203 he twice defeated the Carthaginian forces, and a large party at Carthage were anxious to accept his offer of negotiations. But the advocates of resistance triumphed. Hannibal was recalled from Italy, and with him his brother Mago, who had made a last desperate attempt to create a diversion in Italy by landing in Liguria. Mago died on the voyage, but Hannibal returned to fight his last battle against Rome at Zama, where Scipio, who had been continued in command as proconsul for 202 by a special vote of the people, won a complete victory. The war was over. The Roman assembly gladly voted that the Carthaginian request for peace should be granted, and entrusted the settlement of the terms to its favourite Scipio and a commission of ten senators. Carthage was allowed to retain her own territory in Africa intact; but she undertook to wage no wars outside Africa, and none inside without the consent of Rome. She surrendered all her ships but ten triremes, her elephants, and all prisoners of war. Finally she agreed to pay an indemnity of 10,000 talents in fifty years. Masinissa was rewarded by an increase of territory, and was enrolled among the “allies and friends” of the Roman people. ^[170.]

The battle of Zama decided the fate of the West. The power of Carthage was broken, and her supremacy passed by the right of conquest to Rome. Henceforth Rome had no rival to fear westward of Italy, and it rested with herself to settle within what limits her supremacy should be confined, and what form it should take. The answer to both these questions was largely determined for her by circumstances. For the next fifty years Rome was too deeply involved in the affairs of the East to think of extending her rule far beyond the limits of the rich inheritance which had fallen to her by the defeat of Carthage; and it was not until 125 that she commenced a fresh career of conquest in the West by invading Transalpine Gaul. But within this area considerable advance was made in the organization and consolidation of her rule. The rate of progress was indeed unequal. In the case of Sicily and Spain, the immediate establishment of a Roman government was imperatively necessary, if these possessions were not either to fall a prey to internal anarchy, or be recovered for Carthage by some second Hamilcar. Accordingly, we find that in Sicily the former dominions of Hiero were at once united with the western half of the island as a single province, under the rule of a Roman praetor (201), ^[171.] and that in Spain, after nine years of a provisional government (206-197), two provinces were in 197 ^[172. cf. Staatsverw., IIerrMs, sq.] definitely established, and each, like Sicily, assigned to one of the praetors for the year, two additional praetors being elected for the purpose. But here the resemblance between the two cases ends. From 201 down to the outbreak of the Slave War in 136 there was unbroken peace in Sicily, and its part in the history is limited to its important functions in supplying Rome with corn and in provisioning and clothing the Roman legions. ^[173. cf.] It became every year a more integral part of Italy; and a large proportion even of the land itself passed gradually into the hands of enterprising Roman speculators. The governors of the two Spains had very different work to do from that which fell to the lot of the Sicilian praetors. Although the coast towns readily acquiesced in Roman rule, the restless and warlike tribes of the interior were in a constant state of ferment, which from time to time broke out into open revolt. In Sicily the ordinary praetorian authority, with at most a few cohorts, was sufficient, but the condition of Spain required that year after year the praetors should be armed with the consular authority, and backed by a standing force of four legions, while more than once the presence of the consuls themselves was found necessary. Still, in spite of all difficulties, the work of pacification proceeded. To the elder Cato (consul 195), and to Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus (praetor and propraetor 180-179), father of the two tribunes, is mainly due the credit of quieting the Celtiberian tribes of central Spain, and the government of Gracchus was followed by thirty years of comparative tranquillity. The insurrection headed by Viriathus in 149 was largely caused by the exactions of the Roman magistrates themselves, while its obstinate continuance down to the capture of Numantia in 133, was almost as much the result of the incapacity of the Roman commanders. But the re-settlement of the country by Scipio Africanus the younger in that year left all Spain, with the exception of the highland Astures and Cantabri in the north-west, finally and tranquilly subject to Rome. Meanwhile the disturbed state of the interior had not prevented the spread of Roman civilization on the seaboard. Roman traders and speculators flocked to the seaport towns and spread inland. The mines became centres of Roman industry; the Roman legionaries quartered in Spain year after year married Spanish wives, and when their service was over gladly settled down in Spain, in preference to returning to Italy. The first Roman communities established outside Italy were both planted in Spain, and both owed their existence to the Roman legions. ^[174. Iber.,] Spain even in 133 gave promise of becoming in time “more Roman than Rome itself.”

In Africa there was no question at first of the introduction of Roman government by the formation of a province. Carthage, bound hand and foot by the treaty of 201, was placed under the jealous watch of the loyal prince of Nu[9:20:751]midia, who himself willingly acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome. But it was impossible for this arrangement to be permanent. Every symptom of reviving prosperity at Carthage was regarded at Rome with feverish anxiety, and neither the expulsion of Hannibal in 195 nor his death in 183 did much to check the growing conviction that Rome would never be secure while her rival existed. It was therefore with grim satisfaction that many in the Roman senate watched the increasing irritation of the Carthaginians under the harassing raids and encroachments of their favoured neighbour Masinissa, and waited for the moment when Carthage should, by some breach of the conditions imposed upon her, supply Rome with a pretext for interference. At last in 151 came the news that Carthage, in defiance of treaty obligations, was actually at war with Masinissa. The anti-Carthaginan party in the senate, headed by M. Porcius Cato, eagerly seized the opportunity, and, in spite of the protests of Scipio Nasica and others, war was declared, and nothing short of the destruction of their city itself was demanded from the despairing Carthaginians. This demand, as the senate no doubt foresaw, was refused, and in 149 the siege of Carthage begun. During the next two years little progress was made, but in 147 P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, son of L. Aemilius Paulus, conqueror of Macedonia, and grandson by adoption of the conqueror of Hannibal was, at the age of thirty-seven, and though only a candidate for the aedileship, elected consul, and given the command in Africa. In the next year (146) Carthage was taken and razed to the ground. Its territory became the Roman province of Africa, while Numidia,.now ruled by the three sons of Masinissa, remained as an allied state under Roman suzerainty, and served to protect the new province against the raids of the desert tribes. Within little more than a centuryfrom the commencement of the First PunicWar, the whole of the former dominions of Carthage had been brought under the direct rule of Roman' magistrates, and were regularly organized as Roman provinces.

In Italy itself the Hannibalic war was inevitably followed by important changes, and these changes were naturally enough in the direction of an increased Roman predominance. In the north the Celtic tribes paid for their sympathy with Hannibal with the final loss of all separate political existence. Cispadane Gaul, studded with colonies, and flooded with Roman settlers, was rapidly Romanized. Beyond the Po in Polybius’s time, about sixty years after the Hannibalic war, Roman civilization was already widely spread. In the extreme northeast the Latin colony of Aquileia, the last of its kind, was founded in 181, to hold in check the Alpine tribes, while in the north-west the Ligurians, though not finally subdued until a later time, were held in check by the colony of Luna (180), and by the extensive settlements of Roman citizens and Latins made on Ligurian territory in 173. ^[175.] In southern Italy the effects of the war were not less marked. The depression of the Greek cities on the coast, begun by the raids of the Sabellian tribes, was completed by the repeated blows inflicted upon them during the Hannibalic struggle. Some of them lost territory; ^[176. E.g.,] all suffered from a decline of population and loss of trade; and their place was taken by such new Roman settlements as Brundusium and Puteoli. ^[177.] In the interior the southern Sabellian tribes suffered scarcely less severely. The Bruttii were struck off the list of Roman allies, and nearly all their territory was confiscated. ^[178. Hann., ef. Itak Bund.] To the Apulians and Lucanians no such hard measure was meted out; but their strength had been broken by the war, and their numbers dwindled; large tracts of land in their territories were seized by Rome, and allotted to Roman settlers, or occupied by Roman speculators. That Etruria also suffered from declining energy, a dwindling population, and the spread of large estates is clear from the state of things existing there in 133. It was indeed in central Italy, the home of the Latins and their nearest kinsmen, and in the new Latin and Roman settlements throughout the peninsula that progress and activity were henceforth concentrated, and even within this area the Roman, and not the strictly Latin, element tended to preponderate. Of the twenty colonies founded between 201 and 146 only four were Latin.

(5) Rome in the East, 200-133.—Ever since the repulse of Pyrrhus from Italy, Rome had been slowly drifting into closer contact with the Eastern states. With one of the three great powers which had divided between them the empire of Alexander, with Egypt, she had formed an alliance in 273, and the alliance had been cemented by the growth of commercial intercourse between the two countries. ^[179.] In 228 her chastisement of the Illyrian pirates had led naturally enough to the establishment of friendly relations with some of the states of Greece proper. Further than this, however, Rome for the time showed no desire to go. The connexions already formed were sufficient to open the eastern ports to her trade, and the engrossing struggle with Carthage left her neither leisure nor strength for active interference in the incessant feuds and rivalries which had made up Eastern politics since the falling asunder of Alexander’s empire. In 214 the alliance between Philip and Hannibal, and the former’s threatened attack on Italy, forced her into war with Macedon, but even then she contented herself with heading a coalition of the Greek states against him, which effectually frustrated his designs against herself; and at the first opportunity (205) she ended the war by a peace which left the position unchanged. The results of the war were not only to draw closer the ties which bound Rome to the Greek states, but to inspire the senate with a genuine dread of Philip’s restless ambition, and with a bitter resentment against him for his union with Hannibal. The events of the next four years served to deepen both these feelings. In 205 Philip entered into a compact with Antiochus of Syria for the partition between them of the dominions of Egypt, ^[180.] now left by the death of Ptolemy Philopator to the rule of a boy king. Antiochus was to take Ccele-Syria and Phoenicia, while Philip claimed for his share the districts subject to Egypt on the coasts of the Aegean and the Greek islands. Philip no doubt hoped to be able to secure these unlawful acquisitions before the close of the Second Punic War should set Rome free to interfere with his plans. But the obstinate resistance offered by Attalus of Perga-mum and the Rhodians upset his calculations. In 201 Rome ma*de peace with Carthage, and the senate had leisure to listen to the urgent appeal for assistance which reached her from her Eastern allies. With Antiochus indeed the senate was not yet prepared to quarrel; Egypt was assured of the continued friendship of Rome, but Antiochus was allowed to work his will in Ccele-Syria. ^[181.] With Philip it is clear that the senate had no thoughts of a peaceful settlement. Their animosity against him had been deepened by the assistance he had recently rendered to Carthage. Always an unsafe and turbulent [9:20:752]neighbour, he would, if allowed to become supreme in the Aegean, prove as dangerous to her interests in the East as Carthage had been in the AVest; nor, lastly, could Rome, in honour, look quietly on at the ill-treatment of states which, as Greeks and as allies of her own, had a double claim on her protection. To cripple or at least to stay the growth of Philip’s power was in the eyes of the senate a necessity, but it was only by representing a AIacedonian invasion of Italy as imminent that they persuaded the assembly, which was longing for peace, to pass a declaration of war ^[182.] (200), an ostensible pretext for which was found in the invasion by Macedonian troops of the territory of Rome’s ally, Athens.

The war commenced in the summer of 200 b.c., and, though the landing of the Roman legions in Epirus was not followed, as had been hoped, by any general rising , against Philip, yet the latter had soon to discover that, if they were not enthusiastic for Rome, they were still less inclined actively to assist himself. Neither by force nor diplomacy could he make any Jirogress south of Bceotia. The fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes, now the zealous allies of Rome, protected Attica and watched the eastern coasts. The Achaeans and Nabis of Sparta were obstinately neutral, while nearer home in the north the Epirots and Aetolians threatened Thessaly and AIacedonia. His own resources both in men and in money had been severely strained by his constant wars, ^[183.] and the only ally who could have given him effective assistance, Antiochus, was fully occupied with the conquest of Ccele-Syria. It is no wonder then that, in spite of his dashing generalship and high courage, he made but a brief stand. T. Quinctius Flamininus (consul 198), in his first year of command, defeated him on the Aous, drove him back to the pass of Tempe, and in the next year utterly routed him at Cynos-cephalae. Almost at the same moment the Achaeans, who' had now joined Rome, took Corinth, and the Rhodians defeated his troops in Caria. ^[184. Jb.,] Further resistance was impossible; Philip submitted, and early the next year a Roman commission reached Greece with instructions to arrange terms of peace. These were such as effectually secured Rome’s main object in the war, the removal of all danger to herself and her allies from AIacedonian aggression. ^[185.] Philip was left in possession of his kingdom, but was degraded to the rank of a second-rate power, deprived of all possessions in Greece, Thrace, and Asia AIinor, and forbidden, as Carthage had been in 201, to wage war without the consent of Rome, whose ally and friend he now became. AIacedon thus weakened could no longer be formidable, but might yet be useful, not only as a barrier against Thracians and Celts, ^[186.] but as a check upon anti-Roman intrigues in Greece.

The second point in the settlement now effected by Rome was the liberation of the Greeks, The “freedom of Greece” was proclaimed at the Isthmian games amid a scene of wild enthusiasm, ^[187.] which reached its height when two years later (194) Flamininus withdrew his trooj>s even from the “three fetters of Greece ”—Chalcis, Demetrias, and Corinth. ^[188.] There is no reason to doubt that, in acting thus, not only Flamininus himself, but the senate and people at home were influenced, partly at any rate, by feelings of genuine sympathy with the Greeks and reverence for their past. It is equally clear that no other course was open to them. For Rome to have annexed Greece, as she had annexed Sicily and Spain, would have been a flagrant violation of the pledges she had repeatedly given both before and during the war; the attempt would have excited the fiercest opposition, and would probably have thrown the Asiatic as well as the European Greeks into the arms of Antiochus. But a friendly and independent Greece would be at once a check on AIacedon, a barrier against aggression from the East, and a promising field for Roman commerce. Nor while liberating the Greeks did Rome abstain from such arrangements as seemed necessary to secure the predominance of her own influence. In the Peloponnese, for instance, the Achaeans were rewarded by considerable accessions of territory; and it is possible that the Greek states, as allies of Rome, were expected to refrain from war upon each other without her consent. The failure of the policy, after all, was due to the impracticability of the Greeks, and the intensity of their civic and tribal feuds. To suppose as some have done that Rome intended it to fail is to attribute to the statesmen of the generation of Scipio and Flamininus even more than the cynicism of the time of L. AIummius. ^[189. R. G., R. G., Studien zur Röm. Gesch., sq.]

Antiochus III. of Syria, Philip’s accomplice in the pro-j>osed partition of the dominions of their common rival, Egypt, returned from the conquest of Coele-Syria (198) to learn first of all that Philip was hard pressed by the Romans, and shortly afterwards that he had been decisively beaten at Cynoscephalae. It was already too late to assist his former ally, but Antiochus resolved at any rate to lose no time in securing for himself the possessions of the Ptolemies in Asia Alinor and in eastern Thrace, which Philip had claimed, and which Rome now pronounced free and independent. In 197-196 he overran Asia AIinor and crossed into Thrace. ^[190.] But Antiochus was pleasure-loving, irresolute, and above all no general, and it was not until 192 that the urgent entreaties of the Aetolians, and the withdrawal of the Roman troops from Greece, nerved him to the decisive step of crossing the Aegean; and even then the force he took with him was so small as to show that he completely failed to appreciate the nature of the task before him. ^[191.] At Rome the prospect of a conflict with Antiochus excited great anxiety, and it was not until every resource of diplomacy had been exhausted that war was declared. ^[192.] At a distance, indeed, Antiochus, the great king, the lord of all the forces of Asia, seemed an infinitely more formidable opponent than their better known neighbour Philip, and a war against the vaguely known powers of the East a far more serious matter than a campaign in Thessaly. War, however, was unavoidable, unless Rome was to desert her Greek allies, and allow Antiochus to advance unopposed to the coasts of the Adriatic. And the war had no sooner commenced than the real weakness which lay behind the magnificent pretensions of the “king of kings” was revealed.

Had Antiochus acted with energy when in 192 he landed in Greece, he might have won the day before the Roman legions appeared. As it was, in spite of the warnings of Hannibal, ^[193.] who was now in his camp, and of the Aetolians, he frittered away valuable time between his pleasures at Chalcis and useless attacks on petty Thessalian towns. In 191 Glabrio landed at the head of an imposing force; and a single battle at Thermopylae broke the courage of Antiochus, .who hastily recrossed the sea to Ephesus, leaving his Aetolian allies to their fate. But Rome could not pause here. The safety of her faithful allies, the Pergamenes and Rhodians, and of the Greek cities in Asia Alinor, as well as the necessity of chastising Antiochus, demanded an invasion of Asia. A Roman fleet [9:20:753]had already (191) crossed the Aegean, and in concert with the fleets of Pergamum and Rhodes worsted the navy of Antiochus. In 190 the new consul L. Scipio, accompanied by his famous brother, the conqueror of Africa, led the Roman legions for the first time into Asia. At Magnesia, near Mount Sipylus in Lydia, he met and defeated the motley aιid ill-disciplined hosts of the great king. ^[194.] For the first time the West, under Roman leadership, successfully encountered the forces of the East, and the struggle began which lasted far on into the days of the emperors. The terms of the peace which followed the victory at Magnesia tell their own story clearly enough. There is no question, any more than in Greece, of annexation; the main object in view is that of securing the predominance of Roman interests and influence throughout the peninsula of Asia Minor, and removing to a safe distance the only Eastern power which could be considered dangerous. ^[195.] The line of the Halys and the Taurus range, the natural boundary of the peninsula eastward, was established as the boundary between Antiochus and the kingdoms, cities, and peoples now enrolled as the allies and friends of Rome. This line Antiochus was forbidden to cross; nor was he to send ships of war farther west than Cape Sarpedon in Cilicia. Immediately to the west of this frontier lay the small states of Bithynia and Paphlagonia and the immigrant Celtic Galatae, and these frontier states, now the allies of Rome, served as a second line of defence against attacks from the east. The area lying between these “buffer states” and the Aegean was organized by Rome in such a way as should at once reward the fidelity of her allies and secure both her own paramount authority and safety from foreign attack. Pergamum and Rhodes were so strengthened—the former by the gift of the Chersonese, Lycaonia, Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia, the latter by that of Lycia and Caria—as not only amply to reward their loyalty, but to constitute them effective props of Roman interests and effective barriers alike against Thracian and Celtic raids in the north and against aggression by Syria in the south. Lastly, the Greek cities on the coast, except those already tributary to Pergamum, were declared free, and established as independent allies of Rome.

In a space of little over eleven years (200-189) Rome had broken the power of Alexander’s successors and established throughout the eastern Mediterranean a Roman protectorate. It remained to be seen whether this protectorate could be maintained, or whether Rome would be driven to that policy of annexation which she had adopted from the first in Sicily and Spain.

It was in the western half of the protectorate in European Greece that the first steps in the direction of annexation were taken. The enthusiasm provoked by the liberation of the Greeks had died away, and its place had been taken by feelings of dissatisfied ambition or sullen resentment. Internecine feuds and economic distress had brought many parts of Greece to the verge of anarchy, and, above all, the very foundations of the settlement effected in 197 were threatened by the reviving power and aspirations of Macedon. Loyally as Philip had aided Rome in the war with Antiochus, the peace of Magnesia brought him nothing but fresh humiliation. He was forced to abandon all hopes of recovering Thessaly, and he had the mortification to see the hated king of Pergamum installed almost on his borders as master of the Thracian Chersonese. Resistance at the time was unavailing, but from 189 until his death (179) he laboured patiently and quietly to increase the internal resources of his own kingdom, ^[196. sq.] and to foment, by dexterous intrigue, feelings of hostility to Rome among his Greek and barbarian neighbours. His successor, Perseus, his son by a left-handed alliance, continued his father’s work. He made friends among the Illyrian and Thracian princes, connected himself by marriage with Antiochus IV. of Syria and with Prusias of Bithynia, and, among the Greek peoples, strove, not without success, to revive the memories of the past glories of Greece under the Macedonian leadership of the great Alexander. ^[197.] The senate could no longer hesitate. They were well aware of the restlessness and discontent in Greece; and after hearing from Eumenes of Pergamum, and from their own officers, all details of Perseus’s intrigues and preparations they declared war. ^[198.] The struggle, in spite of Perseus’s courage and the incapacity at the outset of the Roman commanders, was short and decisive. The sympathy of the Greeks with Perseus, which had been encouraged by the hitherto passive attitude assumed by Rome, instantly evaporated on the news that the Roman legions were on their way to Greece. No assistance came from Prusias or Antiochus, and Perseus’s only allies were the Thracian king Cotys and the Illyrian Genthius. The victory gained by L. Aemilius Paulus at Pydna (168) ended the war. ^[199. Aemil. sq.] Perseus became the prisoner of Rome, and as such died in Italy a few years later. ^[200.] Rome had begun the war with the fixed resolution no longer of crippling but of destroying the Macedonian state. Perseus’s repeated proposals for peace during the war had been rejected; and his defeat was followed by the final extinction of the kingdom of Philip and Alexander. ^[201. θ] Macedonia, though it ceased to exist as a single state, was not definitely constituted a Roman province. ^[202. Aemil., G., G., Staatsverw.,] On the contrary, the mistake was made of introducing some of the main principles of the provincial system—taxation, disarmament, and the isolation of the separate communities— without the addition of the element most essential for the maintenance of order—that of a resident Roman governor. The four petty republics now created were each autonomous, and each separated from the rest by the prohibition of commercium and connubium, but no central controlling authority was substituted for that of the Macedonian king. The inevitable result was confusion and disorder, resulting finally (149-116) in the attempt of a pretender, Andriseus, who claimed to be a son of Perseus, to resuscitate the ancient monarchy. ^[203. Epit.,] On his defeat in 146 the senate hesitated no longer, and Macedonia became a Roman province, with a Roman magistrate at its head. ^[204. loc. cit.,]

The results of the protectorate in Greece, if less dangerous to Roman supremacy, were quite as unfavourable to the maintenance of order. But from 189 to the defeat of Perseus in 167, no formal change of importance in the status of the Greek states was made by Rome. The senate, though forced year after year to listen to the mutual recriminations and complaints of rival communities and factions, contented itself as a rule with intervening just enough to remind the Greeks that their freedom was limited by its own paramount authority, and to prevent any single state or confederacy from raising itself too far above the level of general weakness which it was the interest of Rome to maintain. After the victory at Pydna, however, the sympathy shown for Perseus, exaggerated as it seems to have been by the interested representations of the Romanizing factions in the various states,
[9:20:754]

was made the pretext for a more emphatic assertion of Roman ascendency. All those suspected of Macedonian leanings were removed to Italy, as hostages for the loyalty of their several communities, ^[205.] and the real motive for the step was made clear by the exceptionally severe treatment of the Achaeans, whose loyalty was not really doubtful, but whose growing power in the Peloponnese and growing independence of language had awakened alarm at Rome. A thousand of their leading men, among them the historian Polybius, were carried off to Italy (see Polybius). In Aetolia the Romans connived at the massacre by their so-called friends of 500 of the opposite party. Acarnania was weakened by the loss of Leucas, while Athens was rewarded for her unambitious loyalty by the gift of Delos and Samos.

But this somewhat violent experiment only answered for a time. In 148 the Achaeans rashly persisted, in spite of warnings, in attempting to compel Sparta by force , of arms to submit to the league. λVhen threatened by Rome with the loss of all that they had gained since Cynoscephalae, they madly rushed into war. ^[206. Epit.,] They were easily defeated, and a “commission of ten,” under the presidency of L. Mummius, was appointed by the senate thoroughly to resettle the affairs of Greece. ^[207. Epit., sq. R. G., sq.] Corinth, by orders of the senate, was burnt to the ground, and its territory confiscated. Thebes and Chalcis were destroyed, and the walls of all towns which had shared in the last desperate outbreak were razed to the ground. All the existing Cpnfederaciesweredissolved; no “commercium” was allowed between one community and another. Everywhere an aristocratic type of constitution, according to the invariable Roman practice, was established, and the payment of a tribute imposed. Into Greece, as into Macedonia in 167, the now familiar features of the provincial system were introduced—disarmament, isolation, and taxation. The Greeks were still nominally free, and no separate province with a governor of its own ^[208. loe. cit., Rcm. Staatsverw., sq. CommenU. Epigraph.,] was established, but the needed central control was provided by assigning to the neighbouring governor of Macedonia a general supervision over the affairs of Greece. From the Adriatic to the Aegean, and as far north as the river Drilo and Mount Scardus, the whole peninsula was now under direct Roman rule. ^[209. cf. Rüm. Herrschaft in Illyrien, iLCιpsic,]

Beyond the Aegean the Roman protectorate worked no better than in Macedonia and Greece, and the demoralizing recriminations, quarrels, and disorders which flourished under its shadow were aggravated by its longer duration, and by the still more selfish view taken by Rome of the responsibilities connected with it. ^[210.] At one period indeed, after the battle of l λ ydna, it seemed as if the more vigorous, if harsh, system then initiated in Macedon and Greece was to be adopted farther east also. The levelling policy pursued towards Macedon and the Achaeans was applied with less justice to Rome’s two faithful and favoured allies, Rhodes and Pergamum. The former had rendered themselves obnoxious to Rome by their independent tone, and still more by their power and commercial prosperity. On a charge of complicity with Perseus they were threatened with war, and though this danger was averted ^[211.] they were forced to exchange their equal alliance with Rome for one which placed them in close dependence upon her, and to resign the lucrative possessions in Lycia and Caria given them in 189. Finally, their commercial prosperity was ruined by the establishment of a free port at Delos, ^[212.] and by the short-sighted acquiescence of Rome in the raids of the Cretan pirates. With Eumenes of Pergamum no other fault could be found than that he was strong and successful; but this was enough. His brother Attalus was invited, but in vain, to - become his rival. His turbulent neighbours, the Galatae, were encouraged to harass him by raids. Pamphylia was declared independent, and favours were heaped upon Prusias of Bithynia. These and other annoyances and humiliations had the desired effect. Eumenes and his two successors—his brother and son, Attalus H. and Attalus III.—contrived indeed by studious humility and dexterous flattery to retain their thrones, but Pergamum ceased to be a powerful state, and its weakness, added to that of Rhodes, increased the prevalent disorder in Asia Minor. During the same period we have other indications of a temporary activity on the part of Rome. The frontier of the protectorate was pushed forward to the confines of Armenia and to the upper Euphrates by alliances with the kings of Pontus and Cappadocia beyond the Halys. In Syria, on the death of Antiochus Epiphanes (164), Rome intervened to place a minor, Antiochus Eupator, on the throne, under Roman guardianship. ^[213.] In 168 Egypt formally acknowledged the suzerainty of, Rome, ^[214.] and in 163 the senate, in the exercise of this new , authority, restored Ptolemy Philometor to his throne, but at the same time weakened his position by handing over Cyrene and Cyprus to his brother Euergetes. ^[215. Epit.,]

But this display of energy was short-lived. From the death of Eumenes in 159 down to 133 Rome, secure i in the absence of any formidable power in the East, and busy with affairs in Macedonia, Africa, and Spain, relapsed into an inactivity the disastrous results of which revealed themselves in the next period, in the rise of Mithradates of Pontus, the spread of Cretan and Cilician piracy, and the advance of Parthia. To the next period also belongs the conversion, on the death of Attalus III., of the kingdom of Pergamum into the Roman province of Asia.

Both the western and eastern Mediterranean now acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, but her relations with the two were from the first different. The West fell to her as the prize of victory over Carthage, and, the Carthaginian power broken, there was no hindrance to the immediate establishment in Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, and finally in Africa, of direct Roman rule. To the majority, moreover, of her Western subjects she brought a civilization as well as a government of a higher type than any before known to them. And so in the West she not only formed provinces but created a new and wider Roman world. To the east, on the contrary, she came as the liberator of the Greeks; and it was only slowly that in this part of the empire her provincial system made way. In the East, moreover, the older civilization she found there obstinately held its ground. Her proconsuls governed and her legions protected the Greek communities, but to the last the East remained in language, manners, and thought Greek and not Roman.

Period III.: The Period of the Revolution (146-49 6 b.c.). —In tbe course of little more than a century, Rome had become the supreme power in the civilized world. By all men, says Polybius, it was taken for granted that nothing remained but to obey the commands of the Romans. ^[216.] For

Romani.”
[9:20:755]

the future the interest of Roman history centres in her attempts to perform the two Herculean tasks which this unique position laid upon her,—the efficient government of the subject peoples, and their defence against the barbarian races which swarmed around them on all sides. They were tasks under which the old republican constitution broke down, and which finally overtaxed the strength even of the marvellous organization framed and elaborated by Augustus and his successors.

At the outset the difficulties of Rome were increased by the rapidity with which her new duties came upon her. From a century, first of deadly struggle, and then of dazzlingly easy success, she emerged to find herself called upon to govern a world with the primitive machinery of a small city state, and to deal with new and complicated administrative problems which she had as yet had no leisure to study. Nor was it until her own political system had been remodelled that she was able to deal effectively with the government of the empire at large. During the period which has now to be considered, the period of the so-called Revolution, but little advance was made towards a better imperial organization, and that little was made by men who, like Caesar and Pompey, belonged, both in the methods and aims of their policy and in the position they held, to the empire rather than to the republic.

Although in its outward form the old constitution had undergone little change during the age of war and conquest from 265 to 146, ^[217. R. G., Rom. Alterth., Verf. d. Rom. Reichs, Die Graechen,] the causes, both internal and » external," which brought about its fall had been silently at work throughout. Its form was in strictness that of a moderate democracy. The patriciate had ceased to exist as a privileged caste, ^[218. e.g., rex Rom. Forsch.] and there was no longer any order of nobility recognized by the constitution. The senate and the offices of state were in law open to all, ^[219. Cf. Pro Sestio,] and the will of the people in their comitia had been in the most explicit and unqualified manner declared to be supreme alike in the election of magistrates, in the passing of laws, and in all matters touching the “caput” of a Roman citizen. But in practice the constitution had become an oligarchy. The senate, not the assembly, ruled Rome, and both the senate and the magistracies were in the hands of a class which, in defiance of the law, arrogated to itself the title and the privileges of a nobility. ^[220. R. G., sq.; Rom. Alterth.,] The ascendency of the senate is too obvious and familiar a fact to need much illustration here. It is but rarely that the assembly was called upon to decide questions of policy, and then the proposal was usually made by the magistrate in obedience to the express directions of the senate. ^[221. De-Senect.,] In the enormous majority of cases the matter was settled by a senatus consultum, without any reference to the people at all. The assembly decides for war or peace ^[222.] , but the conduct of the war and the conditions of peace are matters left to the senate. Now and then the assembly confers a command upon the man of its choice, or prolongs the imperium of a magistrate, ^[223.] but, as a rule, these and all questions connected with foreign affairs are settled within the walls of the senate house. It is the senate which year after year assigns the commands and fixes the number and disposition of the military forces, ^[224.] directs the organization of a new province, ^[225.] conducts negotiations, and forms alliances. Within Italy, though its control of affairs was less exclusive, we find that, besides supervising the ordinary current business of administration, the senate decides questions connected with the Italian allies, sends out colonies, allots lands, and directs the suppression of disorders. Lastly, both in Italy and abroad it managed the finances. ^[226. R. G.,] Inseparably connected with this monopoly of affairs to the exclusion of the assembly was the control which in practice, if not in theory, the senate exercised over the magistrates. The latter had become what Cicero wrongly declares they were always meant to be, merely the subordinate ministers of the supreme council, ^[227. Pro Sestio,] which assigned them their departments, provided them with the necessary equipment, claimed to direct their conduct, prolonged their commands, and rewarded them with triumphs. It was now at once the duty and the interest of a magistrate to be “in auctoritate senatus,” “subject to the authority of the senate,” and even the once formidable “tribuni plebis” are found during this period actively and loyally supporting the senate, and acting as its spokesmen in the assembly. ^[228.]

The causes of this ascendency of the senate are not to be found in any additions made by law to its constitutional prerogatives, but first of all in the fact that the senate was the only body capable of conducting affairs in an age of incessant war. The voters in the assembly, a numerous, widely scattered body, many of whom were always away with the legions abroad, could not readily be called together, and when assembled were very imperfectly qualified to decide momentous questions of military strategy and foreign policy. The senate, on the contrary, could be summoned in a moment, ^[229.] and included in its ranks all the skilled statesmen and soldiers of the commonwealth, while its forms of procedure were at least better fitted than those of the comitia for securing the careful discussion and prompt decision of the question before it. The subordination of the magistrates was equally the result of circumstances, though it suited the senatorial advocates of a later day to represent it as an original principle of the constitution, and though it was encouraged and confirmed by the policy of the senate itself. ^[230. E.g.,] For, as the numbers of the magistrates, and also the area of government, increased, some central controlling power became absolutely necessary to prevent collisions between rival authorities, and to secure a proper division of labour, as well as to enforce the necessary concert and co-operation, ^[231.] nor could such a power be found anywhere in the republican system but in the senate, standing as it necessarily did in the closest relations with the magistrate, and composed as it was increasingly of men who were or had been in office.

Once more, behind both senate and magistrates lay the [9:20:756]whole power and influence of the new nobility. ^[232. R. G., sq.] These “nobiles” are essentially distinct from the older and more legitimate patrician aristocracy. Every patrician was of course noble, but the majority of the “noble families” in 146 were not patrician but plebeian. ^[233. E.g.,] The title had been gradually appropriated, since the opening of the magistracies, by those families whose members had held curule office, and had thereby acquired the “jus imaginum.” It was thus in theory within the reach of any citizen who could win election even to the curule aedileship, and, moreover, it carried with it no legal privileges whatsoever. Gradually, however, the ennobled plebeian families drew together, and combined with the older patrician gentes to form a distinct order. Office brought wealth and prestige, and both wealth and prestige were liberally employed in securing for this select circle a monopoly of political power, and excluding new men. ^[234. cf.]
[9:20:757]

in the past. ^[235. sq., Die Gracchen Decline and Fall of the Roman Republic The Gracehi, Marius, and Sulla.] For, while Rome had been extending her sway westward and eastward, while the treasury had been enriched, and while her nobles and merchants were amassing colossal fortunes abroad, the small freeholders throughout the greater part of Italy were sinking deeper into ruin under the pressure of accumulated difficulties. The Hannibalic war had laid waste their fields and thinned their numbers, and when peace returned to Italy it brought with it no revival of prosperity. The heavy burden of military service still pressed ruinously upon them, ^[236.] and in addition they were called upon to compete with the foreign corn imported from beyond the sea, ^[237. sq.] and with the foreign slave-labour purchased by the capital of wealthier men. Farming became unprofitable, and the hard laborious life with its scanty returns was thrown into still darker relief when compared with the stirring life of the camps with its opportunities of booty, or with the cheap provisions, frequent largesses, and gay spectacles to be had in the large towns. The small holders went off to follow the eagles or swell the proletariate of the cities, and their holdings were left to run waste or merged in the vineyards, oliveyards, and above all in the great cattle-farms, of the rich, and their own place was taken by slaves. The evil was not equally serious in all parts of Italy. It was least felt in the central highlands, in Campania, and in the newly settled fertile valley of the Po. It was worst in Etruria and in southern Italy; but everywhere it was serious enough to demand the earnest attention of Roman statesmen. Of its existence the government had received plenty of warning in the declining numbers of able-bodied males returned at the census, ^[238. Ital. Bund, sq.] in the increasing difficulties of recruiting for the legions, ^[239. Epit.,] in servile outbreaks in Etruria and Apulia, ^[240.] and between 200 and 160 a good deal was attempted by way of remedy. In addition to the foundation of twenty colonies, ^[241. Staats-rerw.,] there were frequent allotments of land to veteran soldiers, especially in Apulia and Samnium. ^[242. Ε.g.,] In 180 40,000 Ligurians were removed from their homes and settled on vacant lands once the property of a Samnite tribe, ^[243.] and in 160 the Pomptine marshes were drained for the purpose of cultivation. ^[244. Epit.,] But these efforts were only partially successful. The colonies planted in Cisalpine Gaul and in Picenum flourished, but of the others the majority slowly dwindled away, and two required recolonizing only eight years after their foundation. ^[245.] The veterans who received land were unfitted to make good farmers; and large numbers, on the first opportunity, gladly returned as volunteers to a soldier’s life. Moreover, after 160 even these efforts ceased, and with the single exception of the colony of Auximum in Picenum (157) nothing was done to check the spread of the evil, until in 133 Tiberius Gracchus, on his election to the tribunate, set his hand to the work.

The remedy proposed by Gracchus ^[246. T. G., B. C., Epit., Agr., R. G., sq.;] amounted in effect to the resumption by the state of as much of the “common land” as was not held in occupation by authorized persons and conformably to the provisions of the Licinian law. Unauthorized occupiers were to be evicted; in other cases the occupation was reduced to a maximum size of 1000 acres; ^[247. Β. C.,] the public pastures were reclaimed for agriculture. ^[248. C. I. L., i. 551; Wordsworth, Fragments of Early Latin,] And the land thus rescued for the community from the monopoly of a few was to be distributed in allotments. ^[249. B. C., C. G., C. I. L.,] It was a scheme which could quote in its favour ancient precedent as well as urgent necessity. Of the causes which led to its ultimate failure something will be said later on; for the present we must turn to the constitutional conflict which it provoked. The senate from the first identified itself with the interests of the wealthy occupiers, and Tiberius found himself forced into a struggle with the senate, which had been no part of his original plan. He fell back on the legislative sovereignty of the assembly; he resuscitated the half-forgotten powers of interference vested in the tribunate in order to paralyse the action of· the senatorial magistrates, and finally lost his life in an attempt to make good one of the weak points in the tribune’s position by securing his own re-election for a second year. But the conflict did not end with his death. It was renewed on a wider scale, and with a more deliberate aim by his brother Gaius, who on his election to the tribunate (123) at once came forward as the avowed enemy of the senate. The latter suddenly found its control of the administration threatened at a variety of points. On the invitation of the popular tribune the assembly proceeded to restrict the senate’s freedom of action in assigning the provinces. ^[250. Pro Domo, De Prov. Cons., Jug., Tl.] It regulated the taxation of the province of Asia ^[251. Verr., Ad Ver.,] and altered the conditions of military service. ^[252. C. G.,] In home affairs it inflicted two serious blows on the senate’s authority by declaring the summary punishment of Roman citizens by the consuls on the strength of a senatus consultum to be a violation of the law of appeal, ^[253. C. G., Pro Domo, Pro Rab. Perd.,] and by taking out of the senate’s hands the control of the newly established court for the trial of cases of magisterial misgovernment in the provinces. ^[254. C. G., Eρit., Ann., B. C., C. I. L., Fragm.,] Tiberius had committed the mistake of relying too exclusively on the support of one section only of the community; his brother endeavoured to enlist on the popular side every available ally. The Latins and Italians had opposed an agrarian scheme which took from them land which they had come to regard as rightfully theirs, and gave them no share in the benefit of the allotments. ^[255. B. C., Epit., Dc Rep., ef. Lex Agraria, C. I. L.,] Gaius not only removed this latter grievance, ^[256. R. A., Lex Agr.,] but ardently supported and himself brought forward the first proposals made in Rome for their enfranchisement. ^[257. Vak Max., B. C.,]

Ihne, v. 25; Marquardt, Riirn. Staatsveno., i. 437 sq. ; Lange, Korn. Alterth., iii. 8 sq.; Nitzsch, Graeehen, 294; Dureau de la Malle, Éeon. politique des Romains, ii. 280.

exaggerated the depressing effects of foreign competition, but hardly makes out his case.
[9:20:758]

The indifference of the city populace, to whom the prospect of small holdings in a remote district of Italy was not a tempting one, was overcome by the establishment of regular monthly doles of corn at a low price. ^[258. C. G., Epit.,] Finally, the men of business—the publicans, merchants, and moneylenders—were conciliated by the privilege granted to them of collecting the tithes of the new province of Asia, and placed in direct rivalry with the senate by the substitution of men of their own class as judges in the “quaestio de repetundis,” in place of senators. ^[259. r H.,] The organizer of this concerted attack upon the position of the senate fell, like his brother, in a riot.

The agrarian reforms of the two Gracchi had little permanent effect. ^[260. C. I. L., ib., Liber Colon., Epit.,] Even in the lifetime of Gaius the clause in his brother’s law rendering the new holdings inalienable was repealed, and the process of absorption recommenced. ^[261.] In 118 a stop was put to further allotment of occupied lands, ^[262. Brut., cf. Fragm.,] and finally, in 111, the whole position of the agrarian question was altered by a law which converted all land still held in occupation into private land. ^[263. C. I. L., sq. Fontes Juris Rom.,] The old controversy as to the proper use of the lands of the community was closed by this act of alienation. The controversy in future turns, not on the right of the poor citizens to the state lands, but on the expediency of purchasing other lands for distribution at the cost of the treasury. ^[264. Lex Agr.,]

But, though the agrarian reform failed, the political conflict it had provoked ended only with the dictatorship of Caesar, and the lines on which it was waged were in the main those laid down by Gaius Gracchus. The sovereignty of the assembly continued to be the watchword of the popular party, and a free use of the tribunician powers of interference and of legislation remained the most effective means of giving effect to their aims. At the same time the careers of both Tiberius and Gaius had illustrated the weak points of their position,—the uncertain temper and varying composition of the assembly, the limited tenure of office enjoyed by the tribunes ^[265. e.g., Epit., Jug.,] and the possibility of disunion in their own body, and, lastly, the difficulty of keeping together the divergent interests which Gaius had for a moment united in hostility to the senate.

Ten years after the death of Gaius the populäres once more summoned up courage to challenge the supremacy of the senate; and it is important as marking a step in advance that it was on a question not of domestic reform but of foreign administration that the conflict was renewed. The course of affairs in the client state of Numidia since Micipsa’s death in 118 had been such as to discredit a stronger government than that of the senate. ^[266. Jug., sq. Epit.,] In open defiance of Roman authority, and relying on the influence of his own well-spent gold, Jugurtha had murdered both his legitimate rivals, Hiempsal and Adherbal, and made himself master of Numidia. The declaration of war wrung from the senate (112) by popular indignation had been followed by the corruption of a consul ^[267. Jug.,] (111) and the crushing defeat of the proconsul Albinus. ^[268. Ib.,] On the news of this crowning disgrace the storm burst, and on the proposal of the tribunes a commission of inquiry was appointed into the conduct of the war. ^[269. Ib.,] But the popular leaders did not stop here. Caecilius Metellus, who as consul (109) had succeeded to the command in Numidia, was an able soldier but a rigid aristocrat; and they now resolved to improve their success by entrusting the command instead to a genuine son of the people. Their choice fell on Gaius Marius (see Marius), an experienced officer and administrator, but a man of humble birth, wholly illiterate, and one who, though no politician, was by temperament and training a hater of the polished and effeminate nobles who filled the senate. ^[270. Jug., Marius, Verfas.,] He was triumphantly elected, and, in spite of a decree of the senate continuing Metellus as proconsul, he was entrusted by a vote of the assembly with the charge of the war against Jugurtha. ^[271. Jug.,]

Jugurtha was vanquished; and Marius, who had been a second time elected consul in his absence, arrived at Rome in January 104, bringing the captive prince with him in chains. ^[272. lb., R. G., Joum. of Phil.,] But further triumphs awaited the popular hero. The Cimbri and Teutones were at the gates of Italy; they had four times defeated the senatorial generals, and Marius was called upon to save Rome from a second invasion of the barbarians. ^[273. Epit., Mar., sq.] After two years of suspense the victory at Aquae Sextiae (102), followed by that on the Raudine plain (101), put an end to the danger by the annihilation of the invading hordes; and Marius, now consul for the fifth time, returned to Rome in triumph. There the popular party welcomed him as a leader, and as one who would bring to their aid the imperium of the consul and all the prestige of a successful general. Once more, however, they were destined to a brief success followed by disastrous defeat. Marius became for the sixth time consul; ^[274. Epit., B. C., sq.] of the two popular leaders Glaucia became praetor and Saturninus tribune. But neither Marius nor his allies were statesmen of the stamp of the Gracchi; and the laws proposed by Saturninus had evidently no other serious aim in view than that of harassing the senate. His corn law merely reduced the price fixed in 123 for the monthly dole of corn, and the main point of his agrarian law lay in the clause appended to it requiring all senators to swear to observe its provisions. ^[275. Epit., Pro Balbo, Ad IIerennium, De Vir. III.,] The laws were carried; the senators with the exception of Metellus took the oath; but the triumph of the popular leaders was short-lived. Their recklessness and violence had alienated all classes in Rome; and their period of office was drawing to a close. At the elections fresh rioting took place, and at last Marius as consul was called upon by the senate to protect the state against his own partisans. In despair Saturninus and Glaucia surrendered, but while the senate was discussing their fate they were surrounded and murdered by the populace.

The popular party had been worsted once more in their struggle with the senate, but none the less their alliance with Marius, and the position in which their votes placed him, marked an epoch in the history of the revolution.
[9:20:759]

The six consulships of Marius represented not merely a party victory but a protest against the system of divided and rapidly-changing commands, which was no doubt the system favoured by the senate, but was also an integral element of the republican constitution, and in assailing it the populäres weakened the republic even more than they irritated the senate. The transference of the political leadership to a consul who was nothing if not a soldier was at once a confession of the insufficiency of the purely civil authority of the tribunate and a dangerous encouragement of military interference in political controversies. The consequences were already foreshadowed by the special provisions made by Saturninus for Marius’s veterans, and in the active part taken by them in the passing of his laws. Indirectly too Marius, though no politician, played an important part in this new departure. His military reforms ^[276. Jug., cf. Verf., Staatsv.,] at once democratized the army and attached it more closely to its leader for the time being. He swept away the last traces of civil distinctions of rank or wealth within the legion, admitted to its ranks all classes, and substituted voluntary enlistment under a popular general for the old-fashioned compulsory levy. The efficiency of the legion was increased at the cost of a complete severance of the ties which bound it to the civil community and to the civil authorities.

The defeat of Saturninus was followed by several years of quiet; nor was the next important crisis provoked directly by any efforts of the discredited popular party. It was due partly to the rivalry which had been growing more bitter each year since 122 between the senate and the commercial class, and secondly to the long impending question of the enfranchisement of the Italian allies. The publicani, negotiatores, and others, who constituted what was now becoming known as the equestrian order, had made unscrupulous use of their control of the courts and especially of the “quaestio de repetundis” against their natural rivals, the official class in the provinces. The threat of prosecution before a hostile jury was held over the head of every governor, legate, and quaestor who ventured to interfere with their operations in the provinces. The average official preferred to connive at their exactions; the bolder ones paid with fines and even exile for their courage. In 93 the necessity for a reform was proved beyond a doubt by the scandalous condemnation of P. Rutilius Rufus, ^[277. Epii., Brut.,] ostensibly on a charge of extortion, in reality as the reward of his efforts to check the extortions of the Roman equites in Asia.

The need of reform was clear, but it was not so easy to carry a reform which would certainly be opposed by the whole strength of the equestrian order, and which, as involving the repeal of a Sempronian law, would arouse the resentment of the popular party. The difficulties of the Italian question were more serious. That the Italian allies were discontented was notorious. After nearly two centuries of close alliance, of common dangers and victories, they now eagerly coveted as a boon that complete amalgamation with Rome which they had at first resented as a dishonour. But, unfortunately, Rome had grown more selfishly exclusive in proportion as the value set upon Roman citizenship increased. The politic liberality with which the franchise had once been granted had disappeared. The allies found their burdens increasing and their ancient privileges diminishing, while the resentment with which they viewed their exclusion from the fruits of the conquests they had helped to make was aggravated by the growingly suspicious and domineering attitude of the Roman government. ^[278. Staats-verw.,] During the last forty years feelings of hope and disappointment had rapidly succeeded each other; Marcus Fulvins, Gaius Gracchus, Saturninus, had all held out promises of relief—and nothing had yet been done. On each occasion they had crowded to Rome, full of eager expectation, only to be harshly ejected from the city by the consul’s orders. ^[279. De Off., Pro Com.,] The justice of their claims could hardly be denied, the danger of continuing to ignore them was obvious—yet the difficulties in the way of granting them were formidable in the extreme. The temper of senate and people alike was still jealously exclusive, and from a higher than a merely selfish point of view there was much to be said against the revolution involved in so sudden and enormous an enlargement of the citizen body.

Marcus Livius Drusus, who as tribune gallantly took up the task of reform, is claimed by Cicero ^[280. De Orak, De Domo, B. C.,] as a member of that party of the centre to which he belonged himself. Noble, wealthy, and popular, he seems to have hoped to be able by the weight of his position and character to rescue the burning questions of the day from the grasp of extreme partisans and to settle them peacefully and equitably. But he, like Cicero after him, had to find to his cost that there was no room in the fierce strife of Roman politics for moderate counsels. His proposal to reform the law courts excited the equestrian order and their friends in the senate to fury. The agrarian and corn laws which he coupled with it ^[281. B. C., Epik N. H.,] alienated many more in the senate, and roused the old anti-popular party feeling; finally, his known negotiations with the Italians were eagerly misrepresented to the jealous and excited people as evidence of complicity with a wide-spread conspiracy against Rome. His laws were carried, but the senate pronounced them null and void. ^[282. Pro Domo,] Drusus was denounced in the senate house as a traitor, and on his way home was struck down by the hand of an unknown assassin.

The knights retained their monopoly of the courts, but this and all other domestic controversies were silenced for the time by the news which followed hard upon the murder of Drusus that the Italians were in open revolt against Rome. His assassination was the signal for an outbreak which had been secretly prepared for some time before. Throughout the highlands of central and southern Italy the flower of the Italian peoples rose as one man. ^[283. D. Römische Bundesgenossenkrieg,] Etruria and Umbriaheld aloof; the isolated Latin colonies stood firm; but the Sabellian clans, north and south, the Latinized Marsi and Paeligni, as well as the still Oscan-speaking Samnites and Lucanians, rushed to arms. No time was lost in proclaiming their plans for the future. A new Italian state was to be formed. The Paelignian town of Corfinium was selected as its capital and re-christened with the proud name of Italica. All Italians were to be citizens of this new metropolis, and here were to be the place of assembly and the senate house. A senate of 500 members and a magistracy resembling that of Rome completed a constitution which adhered closely to the very political traditions which its authors had most reason to abjure.

Now, as always in the face of serious danger, the action [9:20:760]of Rome was prompt and resolute. Both consuls took the field; ^[284. B. C., Epit.,] with each were five legates, among them the veteran Marius and his destined rival L. Cornelius Sulla, and even freedmen λvere pressed into service with the legions. But the first year’s campaign opened disastrously. In central Italy the northern Sabellians, and in the south the Samnites, defeated the forces opposed to them. And though before the end of the year Marius and Sulla in the north, and the consul Caesar himself in Campania, succeeded in inflicting severe blows on the enemy, and on the Marsi especially, it is not surprising that, with an empty treasury, with the insurgents’ strength still unbroken, and with rumours of disaffection in the loyal districts, opinion in Rome should have turned in the direction of the more liberal policy which had been so often scornfully rejected and in favour of some compromise which should check the spread of the revolt, and possibly sow discord among their enemies. Towards the close of the year 90 the consul Caesar carried the “lex Julia,” ^[285. Pro Balbo, B. C., Pro Archia,] by which the Roman franchise was offered to all communities which had not as yet revolted; early in the next year (89) the Julian law was supplemented by the “lex Plautia Papiria,” introduced by two of the tribunes, which enacted that any citizen of an allied community then domiciled in Italy might obtain the franchise by giving in his name to a praetor in Rome within sixty days. A third law (lex Calpurnia) apparently passed at the same time empowered Roman magistrates in the field to bestow the franchise there and then upon all who were willing to receive it. This sudden opening of the closed gates of Roman citizenship was completely successful, and its effects were at once visible in the diminished vigour of the insurgents. By the end of 89 the Samnites and Lucanians were left alone in their obstinate hostility to Rome, and neither, thanks to Sulla’s brilliant campaign in Samnium, had for the moment any strength left for active aggression.

The termination of the Social War brought with it no peace in Rome. The old quarrels were renewed with increased bitterness, and the newly enfranchised Italians themselves complained as bitterly of the restriction ^[286. B. Verfi., Cfi Horn. Tribus,] which robbed them of their due share of political influence by allowing them to vote only in a specified number of tribes. The senate itself was distracted by violent personal rivalries —and all these feuds, animosities, and grievances were aggravated by the widespread economic distress and ruin λvhich affected all classes. ^[287. B. C., Mithr. Epit.,] Lastly, war with Mithradates had been declared; it was notorious that the privilege of commanding the force to be sent against him would be keenly contested, and that the contest would lie between the veteran Marius and L. Cornelius Sulla. ^[288.]

It was in an atmosphere thus charged with the elements of disturbance that P. Sulpicius Rufus as tribune ^[289. Cfi De Orat., Brutus, B. C., sq.; Epit., Sulla, sq.] brought forward his laws. He proposed—(1) that the command of the Mithradatic war should be given to Marius, (2) that the new citizens should be distributed through all the tribes, (3) that the freedmen should no longer be confined to the four city tribes, (4) that any senator owing more than 2000 denarii should lose his seat, (5) that those exiled on suspicion of complicity with the Italian revolt should be recalled. Whatever may have been Sulpicius’s intentions, these proposals inevitably provoked a storm. The old voters bitterly resented the swamping of the existing constituency; the senate rallied its forces to oppose the alteration in the franchise of the freedmen and the proposed purging of its own ranks; and, lastly, both the senate and Sulla himself, now one of the consuls, ρre-pared-to resist the transference of the Asiatic command to Marius. Both sides were ominously ready for violent measures. The consuls, in order to prevent legislation, proclaimed a public holiday. ^[290. loc. eit.,nμtρωv αρylas πο ∖ Kωv— Cfi Ad Q. F.,] Sulpicius replied by arming his followers and driving the consuls from the forum. The proclamation was withdrawn and the laws carried, but Sulpicius’s triumph was short-lived. From Nola in Campania, where lay the legions commanded by him in the Social War, Sulla advanced on Rome, and for the first time a Roman consul entered the city at the head of the legions of the republic. Resistance was hopeless. Marius and Sulpicius fled, ^[291.] and Sulla, summoning the assembly of the centuries, proposed the measures he considered necessary for the public security, the most important being a provision that the sanction of the senate should be necessary before any proposal was introduced to the assembly. ^[292. B. C., μτgitv απpοβοi ∖ eυrοv ls τbv δημοr] Then, after waiting in Rome long enough to hold the consular elections, he left for Asia early in 87.

Sulla had conquered, but his victory cost the republic dear. He had first taught political partisans to look for final success, not to a majority of votes in the forum or campus, but to the swords of the soldiery; and he had shown that the legions, composed as they now were, could be trusted to regard nothing but the commands of a favourite leader. The lesson was well learnt. Shortly after his departure, Cinna as consul revived the proposals of Sulpicius; ^[293. Epik,] his colleague Octavius at the head of an armed force fell upon the new citizens who had collected in crowds to vote, and the forum was heaped high with the bodies of the slain. ^[294. Pro Sestio, Catil.,] Cinna fled, but fled like Sulla to the legions. When the senate declared him deposed from his consulship, he replied by invoking the aid of the soldiers in Campania in behalf of the violated rights of the people and the injured dignity of the consulship, and, like Sulla, found them ready to follow where he led. The neighbouring Italian communities, who had lost many citizens in the recent massacre, sent their new champion men and money; ^[295.] while from Africa, whither he had escaped after Sulla’s entry into Rome, came Marius with 1000 Numidian horsemen. He landed in Etruria, where his old veterans flocked to his standard, and at the head of some GOOO men joined Cinna before the gates of Rome. The senate had prepared for a desperate defence, but fortune was adverse, and after a brief resistance they gave way. Cinna was acknowledged as consul, the sentence of outlawry passed on Marius was revoked, and Cinna and Marius entered Rome with their troops. Marius’s thirst for revenge was gratified by a frightful massacre, and he lived long enough to be nominated consul for the seventh time. But he held his consulship only a few weeks. Early in 86 he died, and for the next three years Cinna ruled Rome. Constitutional government was virtu-

[9:20:761]

ally suspended. For 85 and 84 Cinna nominated himself and a trusted colleague as consuls. ^[296. Epik,] The state was, as Cicero ^[297. Bruk, TM.] says, without lawful authority. ^[298.] One important matter was carried through—the registration in all the tribes of the newly enfranchised Italians, ^[299. cf. Eρit.,] but beyond this little was done. The attention of Cinna and his friends was in truth engrossed by the ever-present dread of Sulla’s return from Asia. The consul of 86, Valerius Flaccus, sent out to supersede him, was murdered by his own soldiers at Nicomedia. ^[300. Epit., Mithr., Sulla,] In 85 Sulla, though disowned by his government, concluded a peace with Mithradates. ^[301. Epik, Sull.,] In 84, after settling affairs in Asia and crushing Flaccus’s successor Fimbria, he crossed into Greece, and in the spring of 83 landed at Brundusium with 40,000 soldiers and a large following of émigré nobles. Cinna was dead, ^[302. B. C., Epit.,] murdered like Flaccus by his mutinous soldiers; his most trusted colleague Carbo was commanding as proconsul in Cisalpine Gaul; and the resistance offered to Sulla’s advance was slight. At Capua Sulla routed the forces of one consul, Norbanus; at Teanum the troops of the other went over in a body to the side of the outlawed proconsul. After a winter spent in Campania he pressed forward to Rome, defeated the younger Marius (consul 82) near Praeneste, and entered the city without further opposition. In North Italy the success of his lieutenants Metellus, C. Pompeius, and Marcus Crassus had been fully as decisive. Cisalpine Gaul, Umbria, and Etruria had all been won for Sulla, and the two principal leaders on the other side, Carbo and Norbanus, had each fled, one to Rhodes, the other to Africa. Only one foe remained to be conquered. The Samnites and Lucanians whom Cinna had conciliated, and who saw in Sulla their bitterest foe, were for the last time in arms, and had already joined forces with the remains of the Marian army close to Rome. The decisive battle was fought under the walls of the city, and ended in the complete defeat of the Marians and Italians. ^[303. Epik, Sulla, Crassus, loe. eik,]

For a period of nearly ten years Rome and Italy had been distracted by civil war. Constitutional government, whether by senate or assembly, had been in abeyance, while the opposing parties fought out their quarrels with the sword, under the leadership of generals at the head of legions ready and willing to follow them against their fellow citizens and against the established authorities of the state. The strife had spread from the Roman forum to Italy, and from Italy to the provinces; and for the first time the integrity of the empire was threatened by the conflicts of rival governors. ^[304.] The tottering fabric of Italian prosperity had been rudely shaken by the ravages of war. Class hatreds and personal feuds distracted the community, while the enfranchisement of the Italians was in itself a revolution which affected the very foundations of the republic. Such was the situation with which Sulla was now called upon to deal. It was for him to heal the divisions which rent the state asunder, to set in working again the machinery of civil government, and above all so to modify it as to meet the altered conditions, and to fortify it against the dangers which visibly threatened it in the future. The real charge against Sulla ^[305. sp),] is not that he failed to accomplish all this, for to do so was beyond the powers even of a man so able, resolute, and self-confident as Sulla, armed though he was with absolute authority and backed by overwhelming military strength and the prestige of unbroken success. He stands convicted rather of deliberately aggravating some and culpably ignoring others of the evils he should have tried to cure, and of contenting himself with a party triumph when he should have aimed at the regeneration and confirmation of the whole state. His victory was instantly followed, not by any measures of conciliation, but by a series of massacres, proscriptions, and confiscations, of which almost the least serious consequence was the immediate loss of life which they entailed. ^[306. sq.∙, Sulla,] From this time forward the fear of proscription and confiscation recurred as a possible consequence of every political crisis, and it was with difficulty that Caesar himself dissipated the belief that his victory would be followed by a Sullan reign of terror. The legacy of hatred and discontent which Sulla left behind him was a constant source of disquiet and danger. In the children of the proscribed, whom he excluded from holding office, and the dispossessed owners of the confiscated lands, every agitator found ready and willing allies. ^[307. E.g., Cat.,] The moneyed men of the equestrian order were more than ever hostile to the senatorial government, which they now identified with the man who cherished towards them a peculiar hatred, ^[308. Pro Cluent.,] and whose creatures had hunted them down like dogs. The attachment which the new Italian citizens might in time have learnt to feel for the old republican constitution was nipped in the bud by the massacres at Praeneste and Norba, by the harsh treatment of the ancient towns of Etruria, and by the ruthless desolation of Samnium and Lucania. ^[309. Phil., Pro Domo, Ad Atk,] Quite as fatal were the results to the economic prosperity of the peninsula. Sulla’s confiscations, following on the civil and social wars, opened the doors wide for a long train of evils. The veterans whom he planted on the lands he had seized ^[310. Epit., B. C., Catil.,] did nothing for agriculture, and swelled the growing numbers of the turbulent and discontented. ^[311. Cat.,] The “Sullan men” became as great an object of fear and dislike as the “Sullan reign.” ^[312. Lex Agr.,] The “latifundia” increased with startling rapidity—whole territories passing into the hands of greedy partisans. ^[313. LexAgr.,] Wide tracts of land, confiscated but never allotted, ran to waste. ^[314. Lex Agr.,] In all but a few districts of Italy the free population finally and completely disappeared from the open country; and life and property λvere rendered insecure by the brigandage which now developed unchecked, and in which the herdsmen slaves played a prominent part. The outbreaks of Spartacus in 73, and of Catiline ten years later, were significant commentaries on this part of Sulla’s work. ^[315. Pro Tullio. Cat.,] His constitutional legislation, while it included many useful administrative reforms, is marked by as violent a spirit of partisanship, and as apparently wilful a blindness to the future. The [9:20:762]re-establishment on a legal basis of the ascendency which custom had so long accorded to the senate was his main object. With this purpose he had already, when consul in 88, made the “senatus auctoritas” legally necessary for proposals to the assembly. He now as dictator ^[316. Sulla, Ad Att., De Legg.,] followed this up by crippling the power of the magistracy, which had been the most effective weapon in the hands of the senate’s opponents. The legislative freedom of the tribunes was already hampered by the necessity of obtaining the senate’s sanction; in addition, Sulla restricted their wide powers of interference (intercessio) to their original purpose of protecting individual plebeians, ^[317. De Legg., Cf. Verr., Epit.,] and discredited the office by prohibiting a tribune from holding any subsequent office in the state. ^[318. Pro Cornel., In Corn.,] The control of the courts (quaestiones perpetuae) was taken from the equestrian order and restored to the senate. ^[319. Ann., Verr.,] To prevent the people from suddenly installing and keeping in high office a second Marius, he re-enacted the old law against re-election, ^[320. B. C., cf.] and made legally binding the custom which required a man to mount up gradually to the consulship through the lower offices. ^[321. Cf.] His increase of the number of praetors from six to eight, ^[322. De Grig. Juris {Dig., In Pison., Pro Milone,] and of quaestors to twenty, ^[323. Ann., C. I. L.,] though required by administrative necessities, tended, by enlarging the numbers and further dividing the authority of the magistrates, to render them still more dependent upon the central direction of the senate. Lastly, he replaced the pontifical and augural colleges in the hands of the senatorial nobles, by enacting that vacancies in them should, as before the lex Domitia (104), be filled up by co-optation. ^[324. Epit.,] This policy of deliberately altering the constitution, so as to make it pronounce in favour of his own party, was open to two grave objections. It was not to be expected that the new legal safeguards would protect the senate any more efficiently than the established custom and tradition which the Gracchi had broken down; and, secondly, it was inevitable that the popular party would on the first opportunity follow Sulla’s example, and alter the constitution to suit themselves. Still less was Sulla successful in fortifying the republican system against the dangers which menaced it from without. He accepted as an accomplished fact the enfranchisement of the Italians, ^[325. Pro Dmno, Pro Caecina,] but he made no provision to guard against the consequent reduction of the comitia to an absurdity, and with them of the civic government which rested upon them, or to organize an effective administrative system for the Italian communities. ^[326. ef. sq.] Of all men, too, Sulla had the best reason to appreciate the dangers to be feared from the growing independence of governors and generals in the provinces, and from the transformation of the old civic militia into a group of professional armies, devoted only to a successful leader, and with the weakest possible sense of allegiance to the state. He had himself, as proconsul of Asia, contemptuously and successfully defied the home government, and he, more than any other Roman general, had taught his soldiers to look only to their leader, and to think only of booty.^[327. Cat.,] Yet, beyond a few inadequate regulations, there is no evidence that Sulla dealt with these burning questions, the settlement of which was among the greatest of the achievements of Augustus.^[328. Ad Fam., i. 9, 25), a provision which increased rather than diminished his freedom of action; (2) that an outgoing governor should leave his province within thirty days after his successor’s arrival (Cic. Ad Fαm., iii. 6, 4). A “lex Cornelia de majestate” contained, it is true, a definition of treason evidently framed in the light of recent experience. The magistrate was forbidden “exire de provincia, educere exercitum, bellum sua sponte gerere, in regnum injussu populi ac senatus ac-cedere,” Cic. In Pis., Staatsvent).,] One administrative reform of real importance must, lastly, be set down to his credit. The judicial procedure first established in 149 for the trial of cases of magisterial extortion in the provinces, and applied between 149 and 81 to cases of treason and bribery, Sulla extended so as to bring under it the chief criminal offences, and thus laid the foundations of the Roman criminal law.^[329. Criminal-Reeht Criminal-Prozess d. Romer.]

The Sullan system stood for nine years, and was then overthrown—as it had been established—by a successful soldier. It was the fortune of Cn. Pompeius, a favourite officer of Sulla, first of all to violate in his own person the fundamental principles of the constitution re-established by his old chief, and then to overturn it. In Spain the Marian governor Q. Sertorius (see Sertorius) had defeated one after another of the proconsuls sent out by the senate, and was already in 77 master of all Hither Spain.^[330. Sertorius.] To meet the crisis, the senate itself took a step which was in fact the plainest possible confession that the system sanctioned afresh by Sulla was inadequate to the needs of the state. Pompey, who was not yet thirty, and had never held even the quaestorship, was sent out to Spain with proconsular authority.^[331. Pomp., Epit., Pompey] Still Sertorius held out, until in 73 he was foully murdered by his own officers. The native tribes who had loyally stood by him submitted, and Pompey early in 71 returned with his troops to Italy, where, during his absence in Spain, an event had occurred which had shown Roman society with startling plainness how near it stood to revolution. In 73 Spartacus,^[332. Epit., Crass., sq.] a Thracian slave, escaped with seventy others from a gladiators’ training school at Capua. In an incredibly short time he found himself at the head of a numerous force [9:20:763] of runaway slaves, outlaws, brigands, and impoverished peasants. By the'end of 73 he had 70,000 men under his command, had twice defeated the Roman troops, and was master of southern Italy. In 72 he advanced on Rome, but, though he again routed the legions led against him by the consuls in person, he abandoned his scheme and established himself in the now desolate country near Thurii, already the natural home of brigandage. At length in 71 the praetor Crassus, who had been sent against him with no less than six legions, ended the war. Spartacus was defeated and slain in Apulia. In Rome itself the various classes and parties hostile to the Sullan system had, ever since Sulla’s death in 78, been incessantly agitating for the repeal of his most obnoxious laws, and needed only a leader in order successfully to attack a government discredited by failure at home and abroad. With the return of Pompey from Spain their opportunity came. Pompey, who understood politics as little as Marius, was anxious to obtain—what the senate was more than likely to refuse to give him, and what he was not legally entitled to—a triumph, the consulship for the next year (70), and as the natural consequence of this an important command in the East. The opposition wanted his name and support, and a bargain was soon struck. Pompey and with him AIarcus Crassus, the conqueror of Spartacus, were elected consuls, almost in the presence of their troops, which lay encamped outside the gates in readiness to assist at the triumph and ovation granted to their respective leaders. Pompey lost no time in performing his part of the agreement. The tribunes regained their prerogatives. ^[333. Epit., Cf. Com.,] The “perpetual courts” were taken out of the hands of the senatorial judices, who had outdone the equestrian order in scandalous corruption, ^[334. Verf., R. AU., In Verr.,] and finally the censors, the first since 86 b.c., purged the senate of the more worthless and disreputable of Sulla’s partisans. ^[335. Epit., Cf. Pomp., In Verr.,] The victory was complete; but for the future its chief significance lay in the clearness with which it showed that the final decision in matters political lay with neither of the two great parties in Rome, but with the holder of the military authority. The recognition of this fact was fatal to the dignity of politics in the city. In proportion as the mass of the Roman community in Italy, and able aspirants to power, like Caesar, became conscious of the unreality of the old constitutional controversies, they became indifferent to the questions which agitated the forum and the curia and contemptuously ready to alter or disregard the constitution itself, when it stood in the way of interests nearer to their hearts. Of this growing indifference to the traditional politics of the republic, against which Cicero struggled in vain, Pompey is an excellent example. He was absolutely without interest in them, except in so far as they led up to important military commands, and, though he was never revolutionary in intention, his own career, in its quiet defiance of all the established rules of the constitution, did almost more than the direct attacks of others to render the republic impossible.

AVhen his consulship ended, Pompey impatiently awaited at the hands of the politicians he had befriended the further gift of a foreign command. He declined an ordinary province, and from the end of 70 to 67 he remained at Rome in a somewhat affectedly dignified seclusion. ^[336. Pomp.,] But in 67 and 66 the laws of Gabiuius and Alanilius gave him all and more than all that he expected. The ravages of the pirates, encouraged in the first instance by the inactivity which had marked Roman policy in the East after 167, and by the absence of any effective Roman navy in the Alediterranean, had now risen to an intolerable height, and the spasmodic efforts made since 81 had done little to check them. The trade of the AIediterranean was paralysed, and even the coasts of Italy were not safe from their raids. ^[337. R. G., sq.] Aulus Gabinius, a tribune, and a follower of Pompey, now proposed to the people to entrust Pompey with the sole command against the pirates. ^[338. β Pomp., Epit.,] His command was to last for three years. He was to have supreme authority over all Roman magistrates in the provinces throughout the Alediterranean and over the coasts for 50 miles inland. Fifteen Iegati, all of praetorian rank, were assigned to him, with two hundred ships, and as many troops as he thought desirable. These powers were still further enlarged in the next year by the Alanilian law, which transferred from Lucullus and Glabrio to Pompey the conduct of the Alithradatic war in Asia, and with it the entire control of Roman policy and interests in the East. ^[339. Pro Lege Manilia Pomp.,] The unrepublican character of the position thus granted to Pompey, and the dangers of the precedent established, were clearly enough pointed out by such moderate men as Q. Lutatius Catulus, the “father of the senate,” and by the orator Hortensius—but in vain. Both laws were supported, not only by the tribunes and the populace, but by the whole influence of the “ρublicani” and “nego-tiatores,” whose interests in the East were at stake.

Pompey left Rome in 67, and did not return to Italy till towards the end of 62. The interval was marked in Rome by the rise to political importance of Caesar and Cicero, and by Catiline’s attempt at revolution. AVhen in 7O the removal of the restrictions placed upon the tribunate restored to the popular party their old weapons of attack, Caesar was already a marked man. In addition to his patrician birth, and his reputation for daring and ability, he possessed, as the nephew of AIarius and the son-in-law of Cinna, a strong hereditary claim to the leadership of the popular and AIarian party. He had already taken part in the agitation for the restoration of the tribunate; he had supported the AIanilian law; and, when Pompey’s withdrawal left the field clear for other competitors, he stepped at once into the front rank on the popular side. ^[340.] He took upon himself, as their nearest representative, the task of clearing the memory and avenging the wrongs of the great popular leaders, AIarius, Cinna, and Saturninus. He publicly reminded the people of Alarius’s services, and set up again upon the Capitol the trophies of the Cimbric AVar. He endeavoured to bring to justice, not only the ringleaders in Sulla’s bloody work of proscription, but even the murderers of Saturninus, and vehemently pleaded the cause of the children of the proscribed. AVhile thus carrying on in genuine Roman fashion the feud of his family, he attracted the sympathies of the Italians by his efforts to procure the Roman franchise for the Latin communities beyond the Po, and won the affections of the populace in Rome and its immediate neighbourhood by the splendour of the games which he gave as curule aedile (65), and by his lavish expenditure upon the improve[9:20:764]ment of the Appian Way. But it is characteristic of Caesar and of his time that these measures were with him only means to the further end of creating for himself a position such as that which Pompey had already won; and this ulterior aim he pursued with a skill, and with an audacious indifference to constitutional forms and usages, unsurpassed even by Sulla. His coalition with Crassus, soon after Pompey’s departure, secured him an ally whose colossal wealth and wide financial connexions were of inestimable value, and whose vanity and inferiority of intellect rendered him a willing tool. The story of his attempted coup détat in January 65 is probably false, ^[341. Jul., Cat.,] but it is evident that by the beginning of 63 he was bent on reaping the reward of his exertions by obtaining from the people an extraordinary command abroad, which should secure his position before Pompey’s return; and the agrarian law proposed early that year by the tribune Rullus had for its real object the creation, in favour of Caesar and Crassus, of a commission with powers so wide as to place its members almost on a level with Pompey himself. ^[342. Lex Ayr., ,] It was at this moment, when all seemed going well, that Caesar’s hopes were dashed to the ground by Catiline’s desperate outbreak, which not only discredited every one connected with the popular party, but directed the suspicions of the well-to-do classes against Caesar himself, as a possible accomplice in Catiline’s revolutionary schemes. ^[343.]

The same wave of indignation and suspicion which for the moment checked Caesar’s rise carried Marcus Tullius Cicero to the height of his fortunes. Cicero, as a politician, has been equally misjudged by friends and foes. That he was deficient in courage, that he was vain, and that he attempted the impossible, may be admitted at once. But he was neither a brilliant and unscrupulous adventurer nor an aimless trimmer, nor yet a devoted champion merely of senatorial ascendency. ^[344. Letters.] He was a representative man, with a numerous following, and a policy which was naturally suggested to him by the circumstances of his birth, connexions, and profession, and which, impracticable as it proved to be, was yet consistent, intelligible, and high-minded. Born at Arpinum, he cherished like all Arpinates the memory of his great fellow-townsman Marius, the friend of the Italians, the saviour of Italy, and the irreconcilable foe of Sulla and the nobles. A “municipal” himself, his chosen friends and his warmest supporters were found among the well-to-do classes in the Italian towns. ^[345. Ad Att.,] Unpopular with the Roman aristocracy, who despised him as a “peregrinus,” ^[346. Pro Sulla, Cat.,] and with the Roman populace, he was the trusted leader of the Italian middle class, “the true Roman people,” as he proudly styles them. It was they who carried his election for the consulship ^[347. De Petitione Consulatus, passim.] (63), who in 58 insisted on his recall from exile, ^[348. De Domo, Pro Plancio,] and it was his influence with them which made Caesar so anxious to win him over in 49. He represented their antipathy alike to socialistic schemes and to aristocratic exclusiveness, and their old-fashioned simplicity of life in contrast with the cosmopolitan luxury of the capital. ^[349. Pro Quinctio, Pro Cluentio,] By birth, too, lie belonged to the equestrian order, the foremost representatives of which were indeed still the publicani and Iiegotiatorcs, but which since the enfranchisement of Italy included also the substantial burgesses of the Italian towns and the smaller “squires” of the country districts. With them, too, Cicero was at one in their dread of democratic excesses and their social and political jealousy of the “nobiles.” ^[350. l0 In Verr., De Pet. Cons., Pro Cluentio,] Lastly, as a lawyer and a scholar, he was passionately attached to the ancient constitution. His political ideal was the natural outcome of these circumstances of his position. He advocated the maintenance of the old constitution, but not as it was understood by the extreme politicians of the right and left. The senate was to be the supreme directing council, ^[351. De Rep., De Legg.,] but the senate of Cicero’s dreams was not an oligarchic assemblage of nobles, but a body freely open to all citizens, and representing the worth of the community. ^[352. ProSestio, De Legg.,] The magistrates, while deferring to the senate’s authority, were to be at once vigorous and public-spirited; and the assembly itself which elected the magistrates and passed the laws was to consist, not of the “mob of the forum,” but of the true Roman people throughout Italy. ^[353. Pro Sestio,] For the realization of this ideal lie looked, above all things, to the establishment of cordial relations between the senate and nobles in Rome and the great middle class of Italy represented by the equestrian order, between the capital and the country towns and districts. This was the “concordia ordinum,” the “consensus Italiae,” for which he laboured. ^[354. Ad Att.,] He failed because his ideal was impracticable. The inveterate selfishness and exclusiveness of the nobles, the indifference of the Italians to constitutional questions, and their suspicious dislike of Roman politicians, above all the incompetency of the old machinery, even if reformed as he would have had it reformed, to govern the empire and control the proconsuls and the army, were insuperable obstacles in his way.

Cicero’s election to the consulship for 63 over the heads of Caesar’s nominees, Antonius and Catiline, was mainly the work of the Italian middle class, already rendered uneasy both by the rumours which were rife of revolutionary schemes and of Caesar’s boundless ambition, and by the numerous disquieting signs of disturbance noticeable in Italy. The new consul vigorously set himself to discharge the trust placed in him. He defeated the insidious proposals of Rullus for Caesar’s aggrandizement, and assisted in quashing the prosecution of Rabirius. But with the consular elections in the autumn of 63 a fresh danger arose from a different quarter. The “conspiracy ^[355. Catiline In Catilinam; Cicero; R. G., sq.; Entstehung d. Catilinarisehen Verschwörung] of Catiline” (see Catiline) was not the work of the popular party, and still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform; L. Sergius Catilina himself was a patrician, who had held high office, and possessed considerable ability and courage; but he was bankrupt in character and in purse, and two successive defeats in the consular elections had rendered him desperate. To retrieve his broken fortunes by violence was a course which was only too readily suggested by the history of the last forty years, and materials for a conflagration abounded on all sides. The danger to be feared from his intrigues lay in the state of Italy, which made a revolt against society and the established government only too likely if once a leader presented himself, and it was such a revolt that Catiline in 65 is certain, and they were suspected naturally enough of favouring t∏3 designs in 63, but their complicity is in the highest degree improbable. '
[9:20:765]

endeavoured to organize. Bankrupt nobles like himself, Sullan veterans and the starving peasants whom they had dispossessed of their holdings, outlaws of every description, the slave population of Rome, and the wilder herdsmen-slaves of the Apulian pastures, were all enlisted under his banner, and attempts were even made to excite disaffection among the newly-conquered people of southern Gaul and the warlike tribes who still cherished the memory of Sertorius in Spain. In Etruria, the seat and centreof agrarian distress and discontent, arising actually took place headed by a Sullan centurion, but the spread of the revolt was checked by Cicero’s vigorous measures. Catiline fled from Rome, and died fighting with desperate courage at the head of his motley force of old soldiers, peasants, and slaves. His accomplices in Rome were arrested, and, after an unavailing protest from Caesar, the senate authorized the consuls summarily to put them to death.

The Catilinarian outbreak had been a blow to Caesar, whose schemes it interrupted, but to Cicero it brought, not only popularity and honour, but, as he believed, the realization of his political ideal. The senate and the equestrian order, the nobles of Rome and the middle class in the country, had made common cause in the face of a common danger; and the danger had been averted by the vigorous action of a consul sprung from the people, under the guidance of a united senate, and backed by the mass of good citizens.

But Pompey was now on his way home, ^[356.] and again as in 70 the political future seemed to depend on the attitude which the successful general would assume; Pompey himself looked simply to the attainment by the help of one political party or another of his immediate aims, which at present were the ratification of his arrangements in Asia and a grant of land for his troops. It was the impracticable jealousy of his personal rivals in the senate, aided by the versatility of Caesar, who presented himself not as his rival but as his ally, which drove Pompey once more, in spite of Cicero’s efforts, into the camp of what was still nominally the popular party. In 60, on Caesar’s return from his propraetorship in Spain, the coalition was formed which is known by the somewhat misleading title of the first triumvirate. ^[357.] Pompey was ostensibly the head of this new alliance, and in return for the satisfaction of his own demands he undertook to support Caesar’s candidature for the consulship. The wealth and influence of Crassus were enlisted in the same cause, but what he was to receive in exchange is not clear. Cicero was under no illusions as to the significance of this coalition. It scattered to the winds his dreams of a stable and conservative republic. Pompey, whom he had hoped to enlist as the champion of constitutional government, had been driven into the arms of Caesar. The union between the senate and the equestrian order had been dissolved, and the support of the publicani lost by an untimely quarrel over the price to be paid for collecting the taxes of Asia, and, to crown all, both his own personal safety and the autnority of the senate were threatened by the openly avowed intentions of Catiline’s friends to bring the consul of 63 to account for his unconstitutional execution of Catiline’s accomplices. His fears were fully justified by the results. The year 59 saw the republic powerless in the hands of three citizens. Caesar as consul procured the ratification of Pompey’s acts in Asia, conciliated the publicani by granting them the relief refused by the senate, and carried an agrarian law of the new type, which provided for the purchase of lands for allotment at the cost of the treasury, and for the assignment of the rich “ager Campanus.” ^[358. B. C., Caesar, Ad Att.,] But Caesar aimed at more than the carrying of an agrarian law in the teeth of the senate or any party victory in the forum. An important military command was essential to him, and he judged correctly enough that in the West there was work to be done which might enable him to win a position such as Pompey had achieved in the East. An obedient tribune was found, and by the lex Vatinia he was given for rive years the command of Cisalpine Gaul and Illyricum, to which was added by a decree of the senate Transalpine Gaul also. ^[359.] It was a command which not only opened to him a great military career, but enabled him, as the master of the valley of the Po, to keep an effective watch on the course of affairs in Italy.

Early the next year the attack upon himself which Cicero had foreseen was made. P. Clodius as tribune brought forward a law enacting that any one who had put a Roman citizen to death without trial by the people should be interdicted from fire and water. Cicero finding himself deserted even by Pompey left Rome in a panic, and by a second Clodian law he was declared to be outlawed. ^[360. Caesar, B. C.,] With Caesar away in his province, and Cicero banished, Clodius was for the time master in Rome. But, absolute as he was in the streets, and recklessly as he parodied the policy of the Gracchi by violent attacks on the senate, his tribunate merely illustrated the anarchy which now inevitably followed the withdrawal of a strong controlling hand. A reaction speedily followed. Pompey, bewildered and alarmed by Clodius’s violence, at last bestirred himself. Cicero’s recall was decreed by the senate, and early in August 57 in the comitia centuriata, to which his Italian supporters flocked in crowds, a law was passed revoking the sentence of outlawry passed upon him.

Intoxicated by the acclamations which greeted him, and encouraged by Pompey’s support, and by the salutary effects of Clodius’s excesses, Cicero’s hopes rose high, and a return to the days of 63 seemed not impossible. ^[361.] With indefatigable energy he strove to reconstruct a solid constitutional party, but only to fail once more. Pompey was irritated by the hostility of a powerful party in the senate, who thwarted his desires for a fresh command and even encouraged Clodius in insulting the conqueror of the East. Caesar became alarmed at the reports which reached him that the repeal of his agrarian law was threatened and that the feeling against the coalition was growing in strength; above all he was anxious for a renewal of his five years’ command. He acted at once, and in the celebrated conference at Luca (56) the alliance of the three self-constituted rulers of Rome was renewed. Cicero succumbed to the inevitable and withdrew in despair from public life. Pompey and Crassus became consuls for 55. Caesar’s command was renewed for another five years, and to each of his two allies important provinces were assigned for a similar period—Pompey

Plut., Caes., 14. ,
[9:20:766]

receiving the two Spains and Africa, and Crassus Syria. ^[362. Epit., Eρ. Ad Fam., Ad Att.,] The coalition now divided between them the control of the empire. For the future the question was, how long the coalition itself would last. Its duration proved to be short. In 53 Crassus was defeated and slain by the Parthians at Carrhae, and in Rome the course of events slowly forced Pompey into an attitude of hostility to Caesar. The year 51 brought with it a renewal of the riotous anarchy which had disgraced Rome in 58-57. Conscious of its own helplessness, the senate, with the eager assent of all respectable citizens, dissuaded Pompey from leaving Italy. His provinces were left to his legates, and he himself remained at home to maintain order by the weight of his influence. It was a confession that the republic could not stand alone. But Pompey’s mere presence proved insufficient. The anarchy and confusion grew worse, and even strict constitutionalists like Cicero talked of the necessity of investing Pompey with some extraordinary powers for the preservation of order. ^[363. Pomp., Ad Q. Fr., De Rxpubtica, Ad Att., De Civ. Dei,] At last in 52 he was elected sole consul, and not only so, but his provincial command was prolonged for five years more, and fresh troops were assigned him. ^[364. utj 56 App j b c i ii- 24.] The rôle of “saviour of society” thus thrust upon Pompey was one which flattered his vanity, but it entailed consequences which it is probable he did not foresee, for it brought him into close alliance with the senate, and in the senate there was a powerful party who were resolved to force him into heading the attack they could not successfully make withβut him upon Caesar. It was known that the latter, whose command expired in March 49, but who in the ordinary course of things would not have been replaced by his successor until January 48, was anxious to be allowed to stand for his second consulship in the autumn of 49 without coming in person to Rome. ^[365. Rechtsfrage zw. Caesar und d. Senat LeDifferend entre CesaretleSenat] His opponents in the senate were equally bent on bringing his command to an end at the legal time, and so obliging him to disband his troops and stand for the consulship as a private person, or, if he kept his command, on preventing his standing for the consulship. Through 51 and 50 the discussions in the senate and the negotiations with Caesar continued, but with no result. On lst January 49 Caesar made a last offer of compromise. The senate replied by requiring him on pain of outlawry to disband his legions. Two tribunes who supported him were ejected from the senate house, and the magistrates with Pompey were authorized to take measures to protect the republic. Caesar hesitated no longer; he crossed the Rubicon and e invaded Italy. The rapidity of his advance astounded and bewildered his foes. Pompey, followed by the consuls, by the majority of the senate and a long train of nobles, abandoned Italy as untenable, and crossed into

Greece. ^[366.] At the end of March Caesar entered Rome as the master of Italy. The story of the civil war which followed, down to the victory at Munda in the spring of 45, has been told elsewhere. ^[367.] We are concerned here with the work which Caesar achieved in the brief intervals

The task which Caesar had to perform was no easy one. It came upon him suddenly; for there is no sufficient reason to believe that Caesar had long premeditated revolution, or that he had previously aspired to anything more than such a position as that which Pompey had already won, a position unrepublican indeed, but accepted by republicans as inevitable. ^[368. G., ,] War was forced upon him as the alternative to political suicide, but success in war brought the responsibilities of nearly absolute power, and Caesar’s genius must be held to have shown itself in the masterly fashion in which he grasped the situation, rather than in the supposed sagacity with which he is said to have foreseen and prepared for it. In so far as he failed, his failure was mainly due to the fact that his tenure of power was too short for the work which he was required to perform. From the very first moment when Pompey’s ignominious retreat left him master of Italy, he made it clear that he was neither a second Sulla nor even the reckless anarchist which many believed him to be. ^[369. Ad Att., Ad Att.,] The Roman and Italian public were first startled by the masterly rapidity and energy of his movements, and then agreeably surprised by his lenity and moderation. No proscriptions or confiscations followed his victories, and all his acts evinced an unmistakable desire to effect a sober and reasonable settlement of the pressing questions of the hour; of this, and of his almost superhuman energy, the long list of measures he carried out or planned is sufficient proof. The “children of the proscribed” were at length restored to their rights, ^[370.] and with them many of the refugees ^[371.] lθ who had found shelter in Caesar’s camp during the two or three years immediately preceding the war; but the extreme men among his supporters soon realized that their hopes of “novae tabulae” and grants of land were illusory. In allotting lands to his veterans, Caesar carefully avoided any disturbance of existing owners and occupiers, ^[372. Caes., Cf.] and the mode in which he dealt with the economic crisis produced by the war seems to have satisfied all reasonable men. ^[373. B. C., Cic., Ad Fam., νϊύ.] It had been a common charge against Caesar in former days that he paid excessive court to the populace of Rome, and now that he was master he still dazzled and delighted them by the splendour of the spectacles he provided, and by the liberality of his largesses. But he was no indiscriminate flatterer of the mob. The popular clubs and guilds which had helped to organize the anarchy of the last few years were dissolved. ^[374.] A strict inquiry was made into the distribution of the monthly doles of corn, and the number of recipients was reduced by one half; ^[375.] finally, the position of the courts of justice was raised by the abolition of the popular element among the judices. ^[376.] Nor did Caesar shrink from the attempt, in which so many had failed before him, to mitigate the twin evils which were ruining the prosperity of Italy,—the concentration of a

[9:20:767]

pauper population in the towns, and the denudation and desolation of the country districts. His strong hand carried out the scheme so often proposed by the popular leaders since the days of Gaius Gracchus, the colonization of Carthage and Corinth. Allotments of land on a large scale were made in Italy; decaying towns were reinforced by fresh drafts of settlers; on the large estates and cattle farms the owners were required to find employment for a certain amount of free labour; and a slight and temporary stimulus was given to Italian industry by the reimposition of harbour dues ιxpon foreign goods. ^[377.] To these measures must be added his schemes for the draining of the Fucine Lake and the Pomptine Marshes, for a new road across the Apennines, and for turning the course of the Tiber. ^[378. Caes.,] It is true that these vigorous efforts to revive the agrarian prosperity of Italy were made along the old lines laid down eighty years before by the Gracchi, and that their final success was no greater than that of preceding efforts in the same direction, but they are a proof of the spirit in which Caesar understood the responsibilities of absolute power, and their failure was due to causes which no legislation could remove. The reform of the calendar, which has been described elsewhere, ^[379. R. G., Röm. Zeittafeln, sq.] completes a record of administrative reform which entitles Caesar to the praise of having governed well, whatever may be thought of the validity of his title to govern at all. But how did Caesar deal with what was after all the greatest problem which he was called upon to solve, the establishment of a satisfactory government for the empire? One point indeed was already settled—the necessity, if the empire was to hold together at all, of placing the army, the provinces, and the control of the foreign policy in more vigorous hands than those of a number of changing magistrates independent of each other, and only very imperfectly controlled by the senate at home. Some centralization of the executive authority was indispensable, and this part of his work Caesar thoroughly performed. From the moment when he seized the moneys in the treasury on his first entry into Rome ^[380.] down to the day of his death he recognized no other authority but his throughout the empire. He alone directed the policy of Rome in foreign affairs; the legions were led, and the provinces governed, not by independent magistrates, but by his “legates;” ^[381.] and the title “imperator” which he adopted was intended to express the absolute and unlimited nature of the “imperium” he claimed, as distinct from the limited spheres of authority possessed by republican magistrates. ^[382. R. G.,] In so centralizing the executive authority over the empire at large, Caesar was but developing the policy implied in the Gabinian and Manilian laws, and the precedent he established was closely followed by his successors. It was otherwise with the more difficult question of the form under which this new executive authority should be exercised and the relation it should hold to the republican constitution. We must be content to remain in ignorance of the precise shape which Caesar intended ultimately to give to the new system. The theory that he contemplated a revival of the old Roman kingship ^[383. Weltgeschichte, sq. Caes.] is supported by little more than the popular gossip of the day, and the form under which he actually wielded his authority can hardly have been regarded by so sagacious a statesman as more than a provisional arrangement. This form was that of the dictatorship; and in favour of the choice it might have beeu urged that the dictatorship was the office naturally marked out by republican tradition as the one best suited to carry the state safely through a serious crisis, that the powers it conveyed were wide, that it was as dictator that Sulla had reorganized the state, and that a dictatorship had been spoken of as the readiest means of legalizing Pompey’s protectorate of the republic in 53-52. The choice nevertheless was a bad one. It was associated with those very Sullan traditions from which Caesar was most anxious to sever himself; it implied necessarily the suspension for the time of all constitutional government; and, lastly, the dictatorship as held by Caesar could not even plead that it conformed to the old rules and traditions of the office. There was indeed a precedent in Sulla’s case for a dictator “reipublicae Constituendae causa,” but Caesar was not only appointed in an unusual manner, but appointed for an unprecedentedly long period, ^[384. ,] and the “perpetual dictatorship” granted him after his crowning victory at Munda (45) was a contradiction in terms and a repudiation of constitutional government which excited the bitterest animosity. ^[385. Phil.,] The dictatorship served well enough for the time to give some appearance of legality to Caesar’s autocratic authority, but it was not—even, it is probable, in his own eyes—a satisfactory solution of the problem.

A second question, hardly less important than the establishment and legalization of a strong central executive authority over the army and the provinces, was that of the position to be assigned to the old constitution, by the side of this new power. So far as Caesar himself was concerned, the answer was for the time sufficiently clear. The old constitution was not formally abrogated. The senate met and deliberated; the assembly passed laws and elected magistrates; there were still consuls, praetors, aediles, quaestors, and tribunes; and Caesar himself, like his successors, professed to hold his authority by the will of the people. But senate, assembly, and magistrates were all alike subordinated to the paramount authority of the dictator; and this subordination was, in appearance at least, more direct and complete under the rule of Caesar than under that of Augustus. Caesar was by nature as impatient as Augustus was tolerant of established forms; and, dazzled by the splendour of his career of victory and by his ubiquitous energy and versatility, the Roman public, high and low, prostrated themselves before him and heaped honours upon him with a reckless profusion which made the existence of any authority by the side of his own an absurdity. ^[386. Cf. R. G., sq.; Cicerds Letters, Stuclia Romana, sq.] Hence under Caesar the old constitution was repeatedly disregarded, or suspended in a way which contrasted unfavourably with the more respectful attitude assumed by Augustus. For months together Rome was left without any regular magistrates, and was governed like a subject town by Caesar’s prefects. ^[387. StuA. Rom.,] At another time a tribune was seen exercising authority outside the city bounds and invested with the “imperium” of a praetor. ^[388. Ad Att.,] At the elections, candidates appeared before republica sustulisset.”
[9:20:768]

the people backed by a written recommendation from the dictator, which was equivalent to a command. ^[389.] Finally, the senate itself was transformed out of all likeness to its former self by the raising of its numbers to 900, and by the admission of old soldiers, sons of freedmen, and even “semi-barbarous Gauls.” ^[390.] But, though Caesar’s highhanded conduct in this respect was not imitated by his immediate successors, yet the main lines of their policy were laid down by him. These were (1) the municipalization of the old republican constitution, and (2) its subordination to the paramount authority of the master of the legions and the provinces. In the first case he only carried further a change already in progress. Of late years the senate had been rapidly losing its hold over the empire at large. Even the ordinary proconsuls were virtually independent potentates, ruling their provinces as they chose, and disposing absolutely of legions which recognized no authority but theirs. The consuls and praetors of each year had since 81 been stationed in Rome, and immersed in purely municipal business; and, lastly, since the enfranchisement of Italy, the comitia, though still recognized as the ultimate source of all authority, had become little more than assemblies of the city populace, and their claim to represent the true Roman people was indignantly questioned, even by republicans like Cicero. The concentration in Caesar’s hands of all authority outside Rome completely and finally severed all real connection between the old institutions of the republic of Rome and the government of the Roman empire. And, though Augustus and Tiberius elevated the senate to a place beside themselves in this government, its share of the work was a subordinate one, and it never again directed the policy of the state; while, from the time of Caesar onwards, the old magistracies are merely municipal offices, with a steadily diminishing authority, even in the city, and the comitia retain no other prerogative of imperial importance but that of formally confirming the ruler of the empire in the possession of an authority which is already his. But the institutions of the republic not merely became, what they had originally been, the local institutions of the city of Rome; they were also subordinated even within these narrow limits to the paramount authority of the man who held in his hands the army and the provinces. And here Caesar’s policy was closely followed by his successors. Autocratic abroad, at home he was the chief magistrate of the commonwealth; and this position was marked, in his case as in that of those who followed him, by a combination in his person of various powers, and by a general right of precedence which left no limits to his authority but such as he chose to impose upon himself. During the greater part of his reign he was consul as well as dictator. ^[391. op. cit., Stud. Rom., loe. eit.,] In 48, after his victory at Pharsalia, he was given the “tribunicia potestas” for life, ^[392.] and after his second success at Thapsus the “praefectura morum” for three years. ^[393.] As chief magistrate he convenes and presides in the senate, nominates candidates, conducts elections, carries laws in the assembly, and administers justice in court. ^[394.] Finally, as a reminder that the chief magistrate of Rome was also the autocratic ruler of the empire, he wore even in Rome the laurel wreath and triumphal dress, and carried the sceptre of the victorious imperator. ^[395.]

Nor are we without some clue as to the policy which

Caesar had sketched out for himself in the administration of the empire, the government of which he had centralized in his own hands. The much-needed work of rectifying the frontiers ho was forced, by his premature death, to leave to other hands, but our authorities agree in attributing to him the design of extending the rule of Rome to its natural geographical limits ^[396. trυvdψaι τbv κυκ ∖ οv τηs fjyepovias”;] —to the Euphrates and the Caucasus on the east, to the Danube and the Rhine or possibly the Elbe on the north, and to the ocean on the west. Within the frontiers he anticipated Augustus in lightening the financial burdens of the provincials, ^[397.] and in establishing a stricter control over the provincial governors, ^[398. Phil.,] while he went beyond him in his desire to consolidate the empire by extending the Roman franchise ^[399. Ad Att.,] and admitting provincials to a share in the government. ^[400.] He completed the Romanization of Italy by his enfranchisement of the Transpadane Gauls, ^[401. Ann.,] and by establishing throughout the peninsula a uniform system of municipal government, which under his successors was gradually extended to the provinces. ^[402. Fragments of Early Latin, R. G.,]

On the eve of his departure for the East, to avenge the death of Crassus and humble the power of Parthia, Caesar fell a victim to the wounded pride of the republican nobles; and between the day of his death (March 15, 44) and that on which Octavian defeated Antonyat Actium (September 2, 31) lies a dreary period of anarchy and bloodshed. ^[403. Romans under the Empire, R]
[9:20:769]

and took command of the eastern half of the empire; Octavian appropriated Italy and the West; while Lepidus was forced to content himself with Africa. ^[404.] For the next twelve years, while Antony was indulging in dreams of founding for himself and Cleopatra an empire in the East, and shocking Roman feeling by his wild excesses and his affectation of oriental magnificence, ^[405. Weltgeschichte, Romans under the Empire, Rom. Alterth., sq.] Octavian was patiently consolidating his power. Of his only two rivals, Lepidus his fellow triumvir was in 36 ejected from Africa and banished to Circeii, while Sextus Pompeius, who had since his defeat at Munda maintained a semi-piratical ascendency in the western Mediterranean, was decisively defeated in the same year, and his death in 35 left Octavian sole master of the West. The inevitable trial of strength between himself and Antony was not long delayed. In 32 Antony inflicted one more outrage upon Roman feeling, and openly challenged the hostility of Octavian by divorcing Octavia in favour of the beautiful and daring Egyptian princess, with whom, as the heiress of the Ptolemies, he aspired to share the empire of the Eastern world. By a decree of the senate Antony was declared deposed from his command, and war was declared against Queen Cleopatra. ^[406. Octav., Anton.,] On September 2, 31, was fought the battle of Actium. ^[407.] Octavian’s victory was complete. Antony and Cleopatra committed suicide (30), and the Eastern provinces submitted in 29. Octavian returned to Rome to celebrate his triumph and mark the end of the long-continued anarchy by closing the temple of Janus; ^[408. Epit., Oct.,] at the end of the next year he formally laid down the extraordinary powers he had held siuce 43, and a regular government was established.

III. The Empire. Period I.: The Principate, 27 b.c.-284 a.d.∙ —(α) TJie Constitution of the Principale.—'ιhe conqueror of Antony at Actium, the great-nephew and heir of the dictator Caesar, was now summoned, by the general consent of a world wearied out with twenty years of war and anarchy, ^[409. Ann.,] to the task of establishing a government which should as far as possible respect the forms and traditions of the republic, without sacrificing that centralization of authority which experience had shown to be necessary for the integrity and stability of the empire. It was a task for which Octavian was admirably fitted. To great administrative capacity and a quiet tenacity of purpose he united deliberate caution and unfailing tact; while his bourgeois birth ^[410. Aug.,] and genuinely Italian sympathies enabled him to win the confidence of the Roman community to an extent impossible for Caesar, with his dazzling pre-eminence of patrician descent, his daring disregard of forms, and his cosmopolitan tastes.

The new system which was formally inaugurated by Octavian in 28-27 b.c. Mommsen, Staatsrecht, ii. 707; Mm. Ancyranum (ed. Mommsen, Berlin, 1883), vi. 13-23, pp. 144-153; Merivale, Romans under the Empire, chap, xxxi.; Cape’s Early Empire, chaps, i. -xii. assumed the shape of a restoration of the republic under the leadership of a “princeps.” ^[412. Ann., ibid.,]

Octavian voluntarily resigned the extraordinary powers which he had held since 43, and, to quote his own words, “handed over the republic to the control of the senate and people of Rome. ^[413. Mm. Aneyr.,] The old constitutional machinery was once more set in motion; the senate, assembly, and magistrates resumed their functions ^[414.]; and Octavian himself was hailed as the “restorer of the commonwealth and the champion of freedom.” ^[415. Fasti, Staatsr.,] It was not so easy to determine what relation he himself, the actual master of the Roman world, should occupy towards this revived republic. His abdication, in any real sense of the word, would have simply thrown everything back into confusion. The interests of peace and order required that he should retain at least the substantial part of his authority; ^[416. ef. Aug.,] and this object was in fact accomplished, and the rule of the emperors founded, in a manner which has no parallel in history. Any revival of the kingly title was out of the question, and Octavian himself expressly refused the dictatorship. ^[417. Mm. Ancyr.,] Nor was any new office created or any new official title invented for his benefit. But by senate and people he was invested according to the old constitutional forms with certain powers, as many citizens had been before him, and so took his place among the lawfully appointed magistrates of the republic;—only, to mark his pre-eminent dignity, as the first of them all, the senate decreed that he should take as an additional cognomen that of “Augustus,” ^[418. Μon. Aneyr.,] while in common parlance he was henceforth styled “princeps,” a simple title of courtesy, familiar to republican usage, and conveying no other idea than that of a recognized primacy and precedence over his fellow citizens. ^[419. Staatsrecht, Joum. of Phil.,] The ideal sketched by Cicero in his De Republica, of a constitutional president of a free republic, was apparently realised; but it was only in appearance. For in fact the special prerogatives conferred upon Octavian gave him back in substance the autocratic authority he had resigned, and as between the restored republic and its new princeps the balance of power was overwhelmingly on the side of the latter.

Under one form or another Octavian had held the “imperium” since 43, and in 33 he had been formally acknowledged as “imperator,” by the consent of all. ^[420. Mm. Ancyr., Staatsr.,] For this somewhat irregular authority was substituted in 27 the regular “proconsular imperium,” ^[421. Staatsr.,] the authority under which for nearly two centuries the provinces had been governed and the legions led to war. He received it in the orthodox way, by decree of the senate; and the decree, as was customary, defined the area of his command. The essential difference between the “proconsular imperium” granted to Octavian and that which had been voted year after year to the ordinary proconsuls, lay in its unprecedentedly wide extent and in its long duration. All the provinces, with the exception of those where no military authority or force was required, were placed under his command, to be governed directly by “Iegati” appointed by him and responsible only to him. ^[422.] The “unarmed [9:20:770]provinces” were to be assigned by lot in the old way to ex-consuls and ex-praetors, and to be nominally under the control of the senate; but in 23 even their governors were declared to be generally subordinate to Octavian as the holder of a higher authority (“majus imperium).” ^[423.] In addition to this control, direct and indirect, of all the provinces, Octavian received also the sole and supreme command of all the military and naval forces of the empire. He alone henceforth levies, pays, and dismisses soldiers, equips fleets, and orders the movements of both army and navy, and he was granted in addition full authority to wage war and conclude treaties with whom he would. ^[424. C. I. L.,] Finally, in 23, if not in 27, he was exempted from the law which required the proconsul to lay down his “imperium” on entering Rome, and was allowed to exercise it within the sacred limits of the pomoerium, ^[425.] a privilege which facilitated the introduction into the city of the prefects, praetorian guard, and summary jurisdiction proper to the proconsul in the province. This “proconsular imperium” was granted in the first instance for ten years, ^[426.] but was renewed for periods of five, five, and ten years successively, and the fiction of its temporary duration and periodic renewal was maintained under Augustus’s successors by the celebration every ten years of the “decen-nalia.” ^[427. Staatsr.,] The Supremeimportanceattached to its possession as the mainstay of the imperial power is sufficiently indicated by the fact that the man on whom it is conferred becomes thereby “princeps,” and the day on which he receives it (“dies imperii ”) marks the beginning of his reign. ^[428. Aeta Fratrum Arvalium Ann., Tib.,]

The proconsular imperium not only carried with it the control of the army and the provinces, but in Rome itself it gave its holder a position of precedence. In virtue of it he took his seat between the consuls, was preceded by Iictors, ^[429. Staatsrecht, Mon. Ancyr.,] and wore the laurel wreath, paludamentum, and sword of the imperator. But as yet Rome could not be governed like a subject provincial city by proconsular authority; and, for the necessary direction and regulation of the constitutional machinery which he had restored, Augustus contented himself ^[430. Ann.,] with the authority which traditionally invested its holder with a popular leadership, that of the tribunes of the plebs. The “tribunicia potestas” had been granted him for life in 36, ^[431. Mon. Aneyr.,] and his tenure of it was confirmed in 23. ^[432. Staatsr.,] lθ Thenceforward it ranked as a constituent element of the principate, second in inιportance only to the proconsular authority. With but few exceptions it was conferred for life upon all succeeding emperors, and the years of their reigns are reckoned by the years of their tribunician power. It was conferred, as all special “potestas” had been conferred under the republic, by a decree of the senate and vote of the assembly. ^[433. Acta Fratrum Arvalium Acta F. Λ., Staatsr., Ann.,] It eave its holder all the prerogatives of the tribunate, without the restrictions which hampered the tribunes themselves. Augustus and his successors were unimpeded in its exercise by the presence of colleagues; and both their personal inviolability and their right of interference held good outside the pomoerium. It enabled them, as representing the acknowledged protectors of the plebs, to control in the name of the people the whole administrative machinery, to introduce laws, to convene the senate, to protect the aggrieved, and to interfere with any exercise of authority by other magistrates. In short, it gave to the man who already wielded an authority abroad more absolute than that granted to Pompey by the Gabinian law all and more than all the power possessed by a Gracchus in Rome.

It was on these two powers that Augustus’s position as princeps rested. In virtue of these he was chief magistrate of the Roman state, and all other offices and privileges conferred upon him are comparatively of secondary importance. The consulship which he held continuously from 31 up to 23 he never accepted again but on two occasions, in 5 B.c. and in 2 B.c., ^[434.] though he was twice invested with “consular authority” for the purpose of taking the census (8b.c., 14 a.d.). ^[435. Mοn. Ancyr.,] That he ever received an extraordinary “morum legumque regimen,” as stated by Suetonius and Dio, ^[436.] is extremely doubtful, and his language in the Ancyran monument implies that for this purpose, as for many others, he found the tribunician authority sufficient. ^[437. Mon. Ancyr. Gr.,] In 22 b.c. he was invested with the “cura annonae,” ^[438. Mon. Ancyr. Lat.,] the supervision of the corn supply and the corn largesses at Rome. On the death of Lepidus in 12 B.c. he succeeded him as “pontifex maximus,” and he was also a member of the augural and other priestly colleges. ^[439. Mon. Ancyr. Lat.,] Lastly, at various times, and probably by decree of the senate, he was granted a number of special exemptions and privileges. ^[440. Staatsr., sq.]

In theory at least, the Roman world was governed according to the “maxims of Augustus” ^[441. Nero,] down to the time of Diocletian. Even in the 3d century there is still, in name at least, a republic, of which the emperor is in strictness only the chief magistrate, deriving his authority from the senate and people, and with prerogatives limited and defined by law. The case is quite different when we turn from the theory to the practice. The division of authority between the republic and its chief magistrate became increasingly unequal. Over the provinces the princeps from the first ruled autocratically; and this autocracy reacted upon his position in Rome, so that it became every year more difficult for a ruler so absolute abroad to maintain even the fiction of republican government at home. The republican institutions, with the partial exception of the senate, lose all semblance of authority outside Rome, and even in their altered position as the municipal institutions of the chief city of the empire they retain but little actual power. The real government even of Rome passes gradually into the hands of imperial prefects and commissioners, and the old magistracies become merely decorations which the emperor gives away at his pleasure. And at the same time the rule of the princeps assumes an increasingly personal character, and the whole work of government is silently concentrated in his hands and in those of his own subordinate officials. Closely connected with this change is the different aspect presented by the history of the empire in Rome and Italy on [9:20:771]the one hand and in the provinces on the other. Rome and Italy share in the decline of the republic. Political independence and activity die out; their old preeminence and exclusive privileges gradually disappear; and at the same time the weight of the overwhelming power of the princeps, and the abuses of their power by individual “principes,” press most heavily upon them. On the other hantl, in the provinces and on the frontiers, where the imperial system was most needed, and where from the first it had full play, unfettered by the fictions of republican government, it is seen at its best as developing or protecting an orderly civilization and maintaining the peace of the world.

The decay of the republican institutions had commenced before the revolutionary crisis of 49. It was accelerated by the virtual suspension of all regular government between 49 and 28; and not even the diplomatic deference towards ancient forms which Augustus displayed availed to conceal the unreality of his work of restoration. The “comitia” received back from him “their ancient rights,” ^[442. Aug.,] and during his lifetime they continued to pass laws and to elect magistrates. But after the end of the reign of Tiberius we have only two instances of legislation by the assembly in the ordinary way, ^[443. Ann., Digest, Epp.,] and the law-making of the empire is performed either by decrees of the senate or by imperial edicts and constitutions. Their prerogative of electing magistrates was, even under Augustus, robbed of most of its importance by the control which the princeps exercised over their choice by means of his rights of nomination and commendation, rights which effectually secured the election of his own nominees. ^[444. Staatsr., Ann., Aug.,] By Tiberius even this restricted prerogative was still further curtailed. The candidates for all magistracies except the consulship were thenceforward nominated and voted for in the senate-house and by the senators, ^[445. Ann., Ann., e.g., Letters, passim,] and only the “renuntiatio,” the formal return of the result, and the introduction of the magistrates designate to the people took place in the assembly. ^[446.] And, though the election of consuls was never thus transferred to the senate, the process of voting seems to have been silently abandoned. In the time of the younger Pliny we hear only of the nomination’ of the candidates and of their formal “renuntiatio” in the Campus Martius. ^[447. Staatsr., Paneg.,] By this empty form the ancient right of the people to confer all magisterial authority was saved, at least in appearance; and it was acknowledged in as purely formal a manner in the case of the princeps himself, who, as long as the principate lasted, continued to receive the “tribunicia potestas” by a vote of the assembly, and was thus held to derive his authority from the people. ^[448.]

This almost complete effacement of the “comitia” was largely due to the fact that they had ceased to represent anything but the populace of Rome, and the comparatively greater vitality shown by the old magistracies is mainly attributable to the value they continued to possess in the eyes of the Roman upper class. But, though they were eagerly sought, ^[449. Epp., Sitten-gesehichte Roms sq.] and conferred on their holders considerable social distinction, the magistrates ceased, except in name, to be the popularly chosen executive officers of the Roman state. In the administration of the empire at large they had no share, if we except the subordinate duties still assigned to the quaestor in a province. In Rome, to which their sphere of work was limited, they were overshadowed by the dominant authority of the princeps, while their range of duties was increasingly circumscribed by the gradual transference of administrative authority, even within the city, to the emperor and his subordinate officials. And their dependence on the princeps was confirmed by the control he exercised over their appointment For all candidates the approval, if not the commendation, of the princeps became the indispensable condition of success, and the princeps on his side treated these ancient offices as pieces of preferment with which to reward his adherents or gratify the ambition of Roman nobles. In all instances, too, the dignity of the office was impaired by the practice, begun by Caesar and continued by Augustus and his successors, of granting the insignia to men who had not held the actual magistracy itself. ^[450. Staatsr., sq. Jul., Ann., Cfi] The change is especially noticeable in the case of the consuls, the chief magistrates of the old commonwealth. The consulship was still the highest post open to the private citizen, ^[451. Agric., Epp.,] and consular rank a necessary qualification for high office in the provinces; ^[452.] but the actual consuls have scarcely any other duties than those of presiding in the senate, conducting its proceedings, and occasionally executing its decrees, ^[453. Paneg.,] while their term of office dwindles from a year to six and finally to two months. ^[454. Staatsreeht, De Ira, Phars., Paneg.,] In the age of Tacitus and the younger Pliny, the contrast is striking enough between the high estimate set on the dignity of the office and the frankness with which both its limited powers and its dependence on the emperor are acknowledged. ^[455. Paneg., Hist., Agmc.,] Of the other magistrates the praetors continued to exercise their old jurisdiction with little formal change down at least to the latter half of the second century, but only as subordinate to the higher judicial authority of the emperor. ^[456. Staatsr.,] The aediles seem to have retained only such petty police duties as did not pass to one or another of the numerous imperial prefects and commissioners. ^[457.] The tribunate fared still worse, for, by the side of the tribunicia potestas wielded by the princeps, it sank into insignificance, and it is described by the younger Pliny as a “shadow and an empty name.” ^[458. Epp., Ann., Epp.,] The quaestorship [9:20:772]suffered perhaps less change than any other of the old offices. It still kept its place as the first step on the ladder of promotion, and there was still a quaestôr attached to each governor of a senatorial province, to the consuls in Rome, and to the princeps himself as proconsul. ^[459. Staatsreeht, Epp.,]

The senate alone among republican institutions retained some importance and influence. The virtual abolition of the comitia, and the degradation of the magistracies left the senate to stand alone as the representative of republicanism, and it thus came to be regarded as sharing the government of the empire with the princeps himself. The magistrates elected by the senate are contrasted with the legates, prefects, and procurators appointed by the emperor. It is to the senate, in theory, that the supreme power reverts in the absence of a princeps. It is by decree of the senate that the new princeps immediately receives his powers and privileges, ^[460. Staatsrecht, Ann., Hist., en bloc Vik Sev. Alex.,] though he is still supposed to derive them ultimately from the people, and is as a rule actually the nominee of the soldiers. After the cessation of all legislation by the comitia, the only law-making authority, other than that of the princeps by his edicts, was that of the senate by its decrees. ^[461. Dig.,] Its judicial authority was parallel with that of the emperor, and at the close of the 1st century we find the senators claiming, as the emperor’s “peers,” to be exempt from his jurisdiction. ^[462. Vita Severi,] But in spite of the outward dignity and importance of this position, and of the politic deference with which it was frequently treated, the senate became gradually almost as powerless in reality as the comitia and the magistracies. The two great supports of its authority under the republic—its identification with the interests of a powerful aristocracy and the subserviency of the magistrates—both fell away under the empire.

The senators continued indeed to be taken as a rule from the ranks of the wealthy, and a high property qualification was established by Augustus as a condition of membership, but any effect which this may have had in giving independence to the position of a senator was counterbalanced by the facilities it afforded to the emperors for securing their own ascendency by subsidizing those whose property fell short of the required standard, and who thus became simply the paid creatures of their imperial patrons. ^[463. Nero, Vesp.] Admission to the senate was possible only by favour of the emperor, as at once controlling the elections to the magistracies, which still as of old gave entrance to the curia, and as invested with the power of directly creating senators by “adlectio,” a power which from the time of Vespasian onwards was freely used. ^[464. Staatsrecht, sq. Dorn.,] As the result, the composition of the senate rapidly altered. Under Augustus and Tiberius it still contained many representatives of the old republican families, whose prestige, influence, and ancestral traditions were some guarantee for their independence. But this element soon disappeared. The ranks of the old nobility were thinned by natural decay and by the jealous fears of the last three Claudian emperors. Vespasian ^[465. Vesρ., Ann.,] flooded the senate with new men from the municipal towns of Italy and the Latinized provinces of the West. Trajan and Hadrian, both pro-

vincials themselves, carried on the same policy, and by the close of the 2d century even the Greek provinces of the East had their representatives among the senators of Rome. Some, no doubt, of these provincials, who constituted the great majority of the senate in the 3d century, were men of wealth and mark, but many more were of low birth, on some rested the stain of a servile descent, and all owed alike their present position and their chances of further promotion to the emperor. ^[466. Sittengeschichte Roms, sq.] The procedure of the senate was as completely at the mercy of the princeps as its composition. He was himself a senator and the first of senators; ^[467. Mon. Ancyr. Gr., πρώτον αξιώματος τόνον.] Iiepossessedthemagisterial prerogatives of convening the senate, of laying business before it, and of carrying senatus consulta; ^[468. C. I. L.,] above all, his tribunician power enabled him to interfere at any stage, and to modify or reverse its decisions. The share of the senate in the government was in fact determined by the amount of administrative activity which each princeps saw fit to allow it to exercise, and by the extent to which he chose to use it as an instrument of government. And this share became steadily smaller. The jurisdiction assigned it by Augustus and Tiberius was in the 3d century limited to the hearing of such cases as the emperor thought fit to send for trial, and these became steadily fewer in number. Its control of the state treasury, as distinct from the imperial fiscus, and of the so-called senatorial provinces passed in fact to the emperor and his officials, and was only occasionally revived by the special favour of emperors who, like Marcus Aurelius, ^[469.] were sincerely attached to old traditions, or, like Severus Alexander and Tacitus, hoped by close alliance with the senate to escape from the evils of a military despotism. ^[470. Vik Sev. Alex., Vit. Tαe.,] Even in Rome and Italy its control of the administration was gradually transferred to the prefect of the city, and after the reign of Hadrian to imperial officers (juridici) charged with the civil administration. ^[471. Vit. Ηadr., u ll Vik Ant.,] The part still played by its decrees in the modification of Roman law has been dealt with elsewhere (see p. 704 supra), but it is clear that these decrees did little else than register the expressed wishes of the emperor and his personal advisers.

The growing impotence of all other authority than that of the princeps inevitably altered the character of the principate. Even under Augustus, Tiberius, and the Claudian emperors, there is a silent and steady concentration of all authority in the hands of the princeps; not only the army and the provinces, but even Rome and Italy, are in reality governed by him, though still with a lingering respect for the traditional prerogatives of the senate and the senatorial magistrates; in the reigus of Caligula, Claudius, and Nero the politic disguise under which Augustus and Tiberius had endeavoured to conceal the extent of their power was thrown contemptuously aside. In the administration of justice and in finance, as well as in military and foreign affairs, the authority of the princeps is paramount; and his own personal subordinates—legates, prefects, procurators, and even his freed-men ^[472. sq. Ann., IIisk,] —divide between them the real work of government. This increase of power was accompanied by a corresponding elevation of the princeps himself above the level of all other citizens. The comparatively modest household and simple life of Augustus were replaced by a more [9:20:773]than regal splendour, and under Nero we find all the outward accessories of monarchy present, the palace, the palace guards, the crowds of courtiers, and a court ceremonial. In direct opposition to the republican theory of the principate, the members of the princeps’s family share in the dignities of his position. The males bear the cognomen of Caesar, and are invested, as youths, with high office; their names and even those of the females are included in the yearly prayers for the safety of the princeps ^[473. Acta Fr. Arval.]; their birthdays are kept as festivals; the praetorian guards take the oath to them as well as to the princeps himself. Finally, the growing practice of Caesar worship invested the chief magistrate of the Roman commonwealth with the divine attributes ascribed to Eastern monarchs. ^[474. Staatsrecht, sq. La Religion Romaine, Rom. Staatsverw., IVom. Mythologie, sq.] The death of Nero was followed, it is true, by a partial reaction. Not only Galba and the Flavian emperors but Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines at once affected a certain simplicity in their personal habits, and discountenanced the excessive servility and adulation encouraged by Caligula and Nero. But this reaction served only to bring into clearer relief the continued advance made towards the establishment of an autocratic and military rule. Caligula, Claudius, and Nero were all first saluted as imperatores by the soldiery and then invested with their powers by the senate, ^[475. Ann.,] but this reversal of the constitutional order was rendered less noticeable by the fact that the choice was still made in Rome, and that it fell in each case on one whose birth already marked him out as the natural successor to the purple. The salutation of Galba by the legions in Spain marks the opening of a new epoch. ^[476. Hist.,] Thenceforward, if the legions do not actually select the princeps, it is their acceptance of him which is the one essential condition of his tenure of power, and it is on their support that he relies. Vitellius and Vespasian were chosen by the legions of Germany and Syria, as Galba had been by those of Spain. Domitian emphasized the military character of his rule by entering the senate in the triumphal dress; ^[477.] and under the great soldier Trajan, whose adoption by Nerva was a frank confession of the necessities of the case, the military title “imperator” was already superseding the older and more constitutional “princeps.”

Closely connected with the increasingly military character of the emperor’s position was the gradual severance of the old ties which connected the emperor, as chief magistrate, with Rome, as the traditional seat and centre of political power. Galba, Vitellius, and Vespasian were already de facto emperors when they entered Rome from their distant provinces to claim the legal confirmation by the senate. Trajan and Hadrian were both provincials by birth; the former did not enter Rome for a full year after his accession, and Hadrian courteously apologized to the senate for taking up the imperium in Syria before his acceptance by that body. ^[478.] The connexion between the emperors and Rome was further weakened by the increasing frequency and length of their absences from the city. Life in Rome was no doubt irksome to men trained in camps, as Trajan had been, and the state of affairs was such as imperatively to require the emperor’s presence in the provinces and on the frontiers. The distant campaigns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, and the unwearying travels of Hadrian, were necessary for the safety and good government of the empire, but they involved the removal from

Rome of the real seat of government. The emperors from Vespasian to Aurelius were, with the exception of Domitian, ready enough to respect constitutional forms, at least in their personal intercourse with the senate, and Aurelius seems sincerely to have wished to share with the senate the overwhelming responsibilities which pressed upon him. But the improved organization of the administrative system which the times demanded was too urgent a need to be set aside out of respect for the niceties of an obsolete constitutional government; and this period is marked by the development and extension of a purely imperial system of government, the control of which was centralized in the hands of the emperor alone. The main credit of this achievement is due to Hadrian, ^[479. Age of the Antonines, ef. Gesch. d. Kaiserzeit, sq.] and its immediate effect was undoubtedly to increase the effectiveness of the administration; but it accelerated the decay of local independence and energy, and thus diminished the strength of the empire. The century which separates the death of Marcus Aurelius from the accession of Diocletian (180-284) completed the destruction of the old Augustan system. Now and again, as in the case of Pertinax, of Severus Alexander, of Maximus and Balbinus, and of Tacitus, the senate succeeded in claiming for itself the selection of an emperor, but with the single exception of Severus Alexander their nominees were not more successful than Nerva in securing the necessary attachment of the legions; as a rule the emperors of the 3d century were more than ever the nominees of the soldiery, often men of obscure origin from the frontier provinces. ^[480. E.g., Vit. Max.,] The worst of them treated the senate with contempt and contumely, and the best of them excluded it from all share in the government. Septimius Severus, a native of Africa, set the precedent of abstaining from seeking a formal confirmation of his authority from the senate; ^[481. Vita Severi, 1. sq.] he assumed the title of proconsul even in Rome, administered justice no longer openly in the forum but within the walls of the palace, and finally established the prefect of the praetorian guard as the officer next in power to the emperor himself. It is, moreover, on his inscriptions that the emperor is first officially styled “dominus.” From the accession of Decius (249), the first of a series of able emperors sprung from the Danubian provinces, the autocratic and military character of the imperial system rapidly develops. The old distinctions between imperial and senatorial provinces, between the state treasury and the privy purse of the emperor, finally disappear. Senators are almost entirely excluded alike from the military and civil services. Lender Aurelian (270-275), an able soldier and a vigorous administrator, the breach with the old traditions became complete. He anticipated Diocletian in the completely autocratic methods of his government and in the Oriental pomp and splendour w τ ith which he surrounded himself.

(6) General History of the Empire.— From the development of the principate of Augustus into the avowed despotism which it was the great work of Diocletian to organize and consolidate we pass to the general fortunes of the empire during this period. On the accession of Augustus, there could be little doubt as to the nature of the work that was necessary, if peace and prosperity were to be secured for the Roman world. He was called upon to justify his position by rectifying the frontiers and strengthening the frontier defences, by reforming the system of provincial government, and by reorganizing the finance; and his success in dealing with these three difficult problems is sufficiently proved consulta.”
[9:20:774]

by the prosperous condition of the empire for a century I and a half after his death. ^[482. Röm. Staatsverw.] To secure the peace which∣ the distracted Roman world desired, it was imperatively necessary to establish on all sides of the empire really defensible frontiers; and this became possible now that for the first time the direction of the foreign policy of the state and of its military forces was concentrated in the hands of a single magistrate. To the south and west the generals of the republic, and Caesar himself, had extended the authority of Rome to the natural boundaries formed by the African deserts and the Atlantic Ocean, and in these two directions Augustus’s task was in the main confined to the organization of a settled Roman government within these limits. In Africa the client state of Egypt was formed into a separate province, and the kingdom of Numidia (25 b.c.) was incorporated with the old province of Africa. In Spain the hill-tribes of the northwest were finally subdued, and a third province, Lusitania, established. ^[483. R. G., sq.] Until the commencement of Caesar’s campaigns (58 B.c.) Roman rule in Gaul had been confined to the single southern province of Gallia Narbonensis (121— 118 B.c.). Caesar subdued the rest of the country, but the fierce struggles of the Civil AVar and his early death obliged him to leave to his nephew the task of organizing the conquered territory. Augustus (27 b.c.) established in addition to the “old province” the three new ones of Aquitania, Lugdunensis, and Belgica. ^[484. R. G.,] Towards the north the republic had left the civilized countries bordering on the AIediterranean with only a very imperfect defence against the threatening mass of barbarian tribes above them. The result ^[485. di. G.,] of Augustus’s policy was to establish a protecting line of provinces running from the Euxine to the North Sea, and covering the peaceful districts to the south,—AIoesia (6 a.d.), Pannonia (9 a.d.), Noricum (15 b.c.), Raetia (15 b.c.), and Gallia Belgica. Roman rule was thus carried up to the natural frontier lines of the Rhine and the Danube. Here, after the defeat of Varus (9 A.D.) and the abandonment of a forward policy beyond the Rhine, Augustus fixed the limits of the empire northward; his successor Tiberius recalled Germanicus, as soon as the disaster in the Silva Teutoburgensis had been avenged; and after the peace with AIaroboduus, the chief of the Alarcomanni on the upper Danube, in the next year (17 a.d.), the defensive policy recommended by Augustus was adopted along the whole of the northern frontier. The line of the great rivers was held by an imposing mass of troops. Along the Rhine lay the armies of Upper and Lower Germany, consisting of four legions each; eight more guarded the Danube and the frontiers of Pannonia and Aloesia. The command of the troops was entrusted to imperial legates, whose posts became the most coveted prizes in the imperial service, and were not Unfrequently stepping-stones to the imperial purple itself. At frequent intervals along the frontier were the military colonies, the permanent camps, and the smaller intervening “castella.” Flotillas of galleys cruised up and down the rivers, and Roman roads opened communication both along the frontiers and with the seat of government in Italy.

In the East Rome had other work to do than that of erecting a barrier against a surging tide of barbarism, for here she was confronted with a well-organized and powerful state whose claims to empire were second only to her own. The conquests of Pompey (66-G2 b.c.) had brought Rome face to face with Parthia on the banks of the Euphrates, the limits of Roman authority being marked by the eastern frontiers of the client states of

Pontus, Cappadocia, and Commagene, and of the newly formed province of Syria. In 54 the rash advance of Crassus beyond the Euphrates provoked the first serious collision between Rome and Parthia, and the victory at Carrhae encouraged among the Parthians the idea of an invasion of Syria and Asia AIinor, while it awakened in Rome a genuine fear of the formidable power which had so suddenly arisen in the East. Caesar was at the moment of his death preparing to avenge the death of Crassus by an invasion of Parthia, and Antony’s schemes of founding an Eastern empire which should rival that of Alexander included the conquest of the kingdom beyond the Euphrates. But on the Euphrates, as on the Rhine and the Danube, Augustus adhered to the policy which he recommended to his successors of “keeping the empire within its bounds”; and the Parthians, weakened by internal feuds and dynastic quarrels, were in no mood for vigorous action. Roman pride was satisfied by the restoration of the standards taken at Carrhae. Four legions guarded the line of the Euphrates, and, beyond the frontiers of Pontus and Cappadocia, Armenia was established as a “friendly and independent ally.” ^[486. R. G.,]

Next in importance to the rectification and defence of the frontiers was the reformation of the administration, and the restoration of prosperity to the distracted and exhausted provinces. The most serious defect of the republican system had been the absence of any effective contral control over the Roman officials outside Italy. This was now supplied by the general proconsular authority vested in the emperor. The provinces were for the first time treated as departments of a single state, while their governors, from being independent and virtually irresponsible rulers, became the subordinate officials of a higher authority. ^[487. Staats-verw., Vcrfi d. Reichs,] Over the “legati” and “procurators” of the imperial provinces the control of the emperor was as complete as that of the republican proconsul over his staff in his own province. They were appointed by him, held office at his good pleasure, and were directly responsible to him for their conduct. The proconsuls of the senatorial provinces were in law magistrates equally with the princeps, though inferior to him in rank; it was the senate that they were as of old responsible; they were still selected by lot from among the senators of consular and praetorian rank. But the distinction did not seriously interfere with the paramount authority of the emperor. The provinces left nominally to the senate were the more peaceful and settled districts in the heart of the empire, where only the routine work of civil administration was needed, and where the local municipal governments were as yet comparatively vigorous. The senatorial proconsuls themselves were indirectly nominated by the emperor through his control of the praetorship and consulship. They wielded no military and only a strictly subordinate financial authority, and, though Augustus and Tiberius, at any rate, encouraged the fiction of the responsibility of the senatorial governors to the senate, it was in reality to the emperor that they looked for direction and advice, and to him that they were held accountable. Moreover, in the case of all governors this accountability became under the empire a reality. Prosecutions for extortion (“de pecuniis repetundis”), which were now transferred to the hearing of the senate, are tolerably frequent during the first century of the empire; but a more effective check on maladministration lay in the appeal to Caesar from the decisions of any [9:20:775]governor, which was open to every provincial, and in the right of petition. Under the Antonines, not the least laborious of the duties which devolved upon the emperor and his ministers was the daily one of hearing and deciding the innumerable cases sent up from the provinces. On the other hand, the growing frequency of imperial mandates and rescripts (see above, p. 705), dealing both with questions of general policy and with points of law, attests the close attention paid by all the better emperors to the government of the provinces and the increasing dependence of the governor on imperial guidance. Within the province Augustus curtailed the powers of legate and proconsul alike. In both cases there was a division of authority. By the side of the imperial legate was placed, as the highest financial authority, an imperial procurator, while the proconsul, in addition to the loss of all military control, was checked by the presence of the imperial officer, also styled procurator, to whom the care of the fiscal revenues was entrusted; finally, both legate and proconsul were deprived of that right of requisitioning supplies which, in spite of a long series of restrictive laws, had been the most powerful instrument of oppression in the hands of republican governors. The financial reforms of Augustus ^[488. sp,] are marked by the same desire to establish an equitable, orderly, and economical system, and by the same centralization of authority in the emperor’s hands. The institution of an imperial census, or valuation of all land throughout the empire, and the assessment upon this basis of a uniform land tax, in place of. the heterogeneous and irregular payments made under the republic, were the work of Augustus, though the system was developed and perfected by the emperors of the 2d century and by Diocletian. The land tax itself was directly collected, either by imperial officials or by local authorities responsible to them, and the old wasteful plan of selling the privilege of collection to publicani was henceforward applied only to such indirect taxes as the customs duties. The rate of the land tax was fixed by the emperor, and with him rested the power of remission even in senatorial provinces. ^[489. Ann.,] The effect of these reforms is clearly visible in the improved financial condition of the empire. Under the republic the treasury had been nearly always in difficulties, and the provinces exhausted and impoverished. Under the emperors, at least throughout the 1st century, in spite of a largely increased expenditure on the army, on public works, on shows and largesses, and on the machinery of government itself, the better emperors, such as Tiberius and Vespasian, were able to accumulate large sums, while the provinces show but few signs of distress. A reformed administration and an improved system of taxation were not the only boons for which the empire at large had to thank Augustus. While the republic had almost entirely neglected to develop the internal resources of the provinces, Augustus set the example of a liberal expenditure on public works, in the construction of harbours, roads, and bridges, the reclamation of waste lands, and the erection of public buildings. ^[490. Aug.,] The crippling restrictions which the republic had placed on freedom of intercourse and trade, even between the separate districts of a single province, disappeared under the empire, and the institution of the provincial councils, as centres of provincial unity, is one among many instances of the more liberal policy . pursued by the emperors. ^[491.] In the eyes of the republican statesmen the provinces were merely the estates of the Roman people, but from the reign of Augustus dates the gradual disappearance of the old pre-eminence of Rome and Italy. It was from the provinces that the legions were increasingly recruited; provincials rose to high rank as soldiers, statesmen, and men of letters; ^[492. Romanische Landschaften Die Ausbreitung d. Lateinischen Sprache] the growing Roman civilization of the Western provinces and the thriving commerce of the populous cities of the East contrasted significantly with the degenerate cosmopolitanism of Rome, and with the dwindling population and decaying industry of Italy; while even into Rome and Italy the methods of administration formerly distinctive of the provinces found their way. From Augustus himself, jealous as he was of the traditions and privileges of the ruling Roman people, date the rule of an imperial prefect in the city of Rome, the division of Italy into regiones in the provincial fashion, and the permanent quartering there of armed troops. ^[493. Avp.,]

For a century and Ja half the policy initiated by Augustus secured the peace and prosperity of the empire; of the emperors who ruled during that period the majority were able and vigorous administrators, and even the follies and excesses of Gaius, Claudius, and Nero did little harm beyond the limits of Rome and Italy. The firm rule of Vespasian repaired the damages inflicted by the wars of the rival emperors after Nero’s death, and the abilities of Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines, if they failed to revive the flagging energies of the empire, at least secured tranquillity and good government. But few additions of importance were made to the territories of Rome. Io Britain] the work begun by Caesar was taken up by Claudius, under whom the southern part of the island was Constituteda province; the northern districts were subdued by Agricola (78-84 a.d.), and the limits of the province northward were finally fixed by the AVall of Hadrian (see Britannia). The conquest of Dacia by Trajan (107) was provoked by the threatening attitude of the barbarian tribes on the lower Danube, and, though it remained part of the empire down to 256, its exposed position as lying beyond the Danube frontier rendered it always a source of weakness rather than strength. ^[494. R. G.,] To Trajan’s reign also belongs the annexation of Arabia Petraea. Otherwise on the frontiers there was little change. In the north the revolt of Civilis (69-70 a.d.) owed its temporary success mainly to the confusion created by the rivalries of Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. ^[495. Hist., R. G.,] The connexion of the Rhine with the Danube frontier bj a continuous wall, a work gradually carried out under the Flavian and Antonine emperors, was a strategical necessity, and involved no general advance of the Roman lines. ^[496. Der Röm. Grenzwall Die Vermessung d. Röm. Grenzicalls] On the Rhine itself the peaceful state of affairs is sufficiently proved by the reduction of the force stationed there from eight legions to four; and it was only on the Danube that there was any pressure severe enough to strain the strength of the Roman defence. The presence of Trajau himself was required to quell the Dacians under their able king Decebalus, and, though his campaigns were followed by sixty years of peace, a force of ten legions was considered necessary to guard the Danubian frontier. Far more serious was the irruption of the Marcomanni and other tribes in the reign of Marcus Aurelius (l62-175.). ^[497. Vita Marci, sq.] lθ The tide of barbaric invasion which then swept across the upper Danube and over the provinces of Rhaetia, Noricum, and Pannonia, till it touched the Alps aud the soil of Italy, was indeed driven back after fourteen years of war, but it first revealed to the Roman world the strength of the forces [9:20:776]which were gathering unnoticed in the distant regions beyond the limits of the “Roman peace.” In the East Rome and Parthia still faced each other upon the banks of the Euphrates, and contended, now by arms now by diplomacy, for supremacy in the debateable land of Armenia. Trajan’s momentary acquisitions were abandoned by Hadrian, and on this side of the empire the first changes of importance on the frontier belong to the reign of Septimius Severus. ^[498.] Within the frontiers the levelling and unifying process commenced by Augustus had steadily proceeded. A tolerably uniform provincial system covered the whole area of the empire. The client states had one by one been reconstituted as provinces, and even the government of Italy had been in many respects assimilated to the provincial type. The municipal system had spread widely; the period from Yespasian to Aurelius witnessed the elevation to municipal rank of an immense number of communities, not only in the old provinces of the West, in Africa, Spain, and Gaul, but in the newer provinces of the North, and along the line of the northern frontier; and everywhere under the influence of the central imperial authority there was an increasing uniformity in the form of the local constitutions, framed and granted as they all were by imperial edict. ^[499. sq.; ef. C. I. L., Fontes Juris Romani,] Throughout the empire again the extension of the Roman franchise was preparing the way for the final act by which Caracalla assimilated the legal status of all free-born inhabitants of the empire, ^[500.] and in the west and north this was preceded and accompanied by the complete Romanizing of the people in language and civilization. Moreover, the empire, that was thus becoming one in its administrative system, its laws, and its civilization, had as yet continued to enjoy peace and order. The burdens of military service fell on the frontier provinces, and only the echoes of the border wars reached the Mediterranean territories. Yet, in spite of the internal tranquillity and the good government which have made the age of the Antonines famous, we can detect signs of weakness. Though the evils of excessive centralization were hardly felt while the central authority was wielded by vigorous rulers, yet even under Trajan, Hadrian, and the Antonines we notice a ailure of strength in the empire as a whole, and a corresponding increase of pressure on the imperial government itself. The reforms of Augustus had given free play to powers still fresh and vigorous. The ceaseless labours of Hadrian were directed mainly to the careful husbanding of such strength as still remained, or to attempts at reviving it by the sheer force of imperial authority. Among the symptoms of incipient decline which not the most heroic efforts of the government could entirely remove were the growing depopulation especially of the central districts of the empire, the constant financial difficulties, the deterioration in character of the local governments in the provincial communities, ^[501. Epp. ad Trajanum.] and the increasing reluctance exhibited by all classes to undertake the now onerous burden of municipal office. Lastly, the irruption of the Marcomanni, and the revolt of Avidius Cassius (174-175) in the Eastern provinces, anticipated the two most serious of the dangers which ultimately proved fatal to the empire.

MarcusAureliusdied in 180, and his death was followed by a century of war and disorder, during which nothing but the stern rule of soldier emperors, such as Septimius Severus, Decius, Claudius, Aurelian, and Probus saved the empire from dissolution. The want of any legal security for the orderly transmission of the imperial power had been partially supplied during the 2d century by the practice of adoption. But throughout the 3d century the Roman world witnessed a series of desperate conflicts between rival generals put forward by their respective legions as claimants for the imperial purple. Between the death of Severus in 211 and the accession of Diocletian in 284, no fewer than twenty-three emperors sat in the seat of Augustus, and of these all but three died violent deaths at the hands of a mutinous soldiery or by the orders of a successful rival. Of the remaining three, Decius fell in battle against the Goths, Valerian died a prisoner in the far East, and Claudius was among the victims of the chronic pestilence which added to the miseries of the time. The “tyrants,” as the Unsuccessfulpretenders to the imperial purple were styled, reappear with almost unfailing regularity in each reign. The claims of Septimius Severus himself, the first and ablest of the soldier emperors, were disputed by Clodius Albinus in the West, and by Pescen-nius Niger in the East, and at the bloody battle of Lug-dunum and the sack of Byzantium rival Roman forces, for the first time since the accession of Vespasian, exhausted each other in civil war. ^[502. Geseh. d. Kaiserzeit,] In 237-238 six emperors perished in the course of a few months. It was, however, during the reign of Gallienus (260-2δ'J) that the evil reached its height. The central authority was paralysed; the barbarians were pouring in from the North; the Parthians were threatening to overrun the Eastern provinces; and the legions on the frontiers were left to repel the enemies of Rome as best they could. A hundred ties bound them closely to the districts in which they were stationed; their permanent camps had grown into towns, they had families and farms; the unarmed provincials looked to them as their natural protectors, and were attached to them by bonds of intermarriage and by long intercourse. Now that they found themselves left to repel by their own efforts the invaders from without, they reasonably enough claimed the right to ignore the central authority which was powerless to aid them, and to choose for themselves “imperatores” whom they knew and trusted. The first of these provincial empires was that established by Postumus in Gaul (259-272), and long maintained by his successors Adctorinus and Tetricus. ^[503.] Their authority was acknowledged, not only in Gaul and by the troops on the Rhine, but by the legions of Britain and Spain; and under Postumus at any rate (259-269) the existence of the Gallic empire was justified by the repulse of the barbarians and by the restoration of peace and security to the provinces of Gaul. On the Danube, in Greece, and in Asia Minor none of the “pretenders” enjoyed more than a passing success. It was otherwise in the far East, where the Syrian Odaenathus, prince of Palmyra, ^[504. cf. Palmyra.] thoughofficially only the governor of the East (dux Orientis) under Gallienus, drove the Persians out of Asia Minor ‘ and Syria, recovered Mesopotamia, and ruled Syria, -Arabia, Armenia, Cappadocia, and Cilicia with all the independence of a sovereign. Odaenathus was murdered in 266. His young son Vaballathus succeeded him in his titles, but the real power was vested in his widow Zenobia, under whom not only the greater part of Asia Minor but even the province of Egypt was forcibly added to the dominions governed in the name of Gallienus by the Palmyrene prince.

Gallienus was murdered at Milan in 268, and the remaining sixteen years of this period were marked by ∣ the restoration of unity to the distracted empire. Palmyra was destroyed and Zenobia led a prisoner to Rome by;
[9:20:777]

Aurelian in 273; in the next year the Gallic empire came to an end by the surrender of Tetricus, and the successors of Aurelian—Tacitus, Probus, and Carus (275-282)—were at least rulers over the whole extent of the empire.

While rival generals were contending for the imperial purple, the very existence of the empire which they aspired to rule was imperilled by foreign invasion. As early as 236 a new enemy, the Alemanni, had crossed the Rhine, but had been driven back by the valour of Maxi-minus (238), and in the same year the Goths first appeared on the banks of the Danube. It was, however, during the period of internal dissension and civil war from the reign of Philip (244-249) to the accession of Claudius (268) that the barbarians saw and used their opportunity. From across the Rhine bands of Alemanni and Franks swept over Gaul and Spain, and even descended upon the coasts of Africa, until their raids were checked by the Gallic emperor Postumus (253-259). Far more destructive were the raids of the Goths. ^[505.] Towards the close of the reign of Philip (247) they crossed the Danube, and overran Moesia, Thrace, and Macedonia. In 251 they defeated and slew the emperor Decius; and, though his successor Gallus purchased a temporary peace by lavish gifts, the province of Dacia was finally lost to Rome. The Gothic raids by sea which began under Valerian (253-260) were even more destructive. Their fleets issuing from the ports of the Black Sea ravaged the seaboard of Asia Minor, and returned laden with the spoils of the maritime towns. In the reign of Gallienus (260-268) a fleet of five hundred sail appeared off the coasts of Greece itself; Athens, Corinth, Argos, and Sparta were sacked, and Epirus laid waste. On the death of Galfienus (268) the Goths once more marched southward, but in the new emperor Claudius they were confronted at last by an able and resolute opponent. They were decisively defeated and driven back across the Danube (269). Claudius died of the plague in the next year, but by his successor Aurelian Roman authority was established in Moesia and Pannonia, and the Danube frontier was put once more in a state of efficient defence. Five years later (276) Probus repulsed a raid of the Franks and Alemanni, and restored peace on the Rhine. But the rule of Rome now stopped short, as in the reign of Tiberius, at the line of the two great rivers; all that had been acquired beyond since the time of Vespasian was abandoned, and on the further banks of the Rhine and Danube stood, in the place of friendly or subject tribes, a threatening array of hostile peoples.

At the close of the 2d century the growing weakness of Parthia seemed to promise an immunity from danger on the Eastern frontier. But with the revolution which jdaced the Sassanidae upon the throne the whole situation was changed. ^[506. ef. Persia.] The new dynasty was in blood and religion Persian; it claimed descent from Cyrus and Darius, and aspired to recover from Western hands the dominions which had once been theirs. In 230 Artaxares (Ardashir) had formally demanded from Severus Alexander the restitution of the provinces of Asia, had invaded Mesopotamia, now a Roman province, and even advanced into Syria. Twenty years later his successor Sapor again crossed the Euphrates; in 260, ten years after Decius’s defeat by the Goths, the emperor Valerian was conquered and taken prisoner by the Persians, who poured triumphantly into Syria and captured Antioch. But here for the time their successes ended. Three years later Odsenathus of Palmyra drove them back, and held the East securely in the name of Rome. On the fall of Zenobia (273) they gained possession for a time of Armenia and Mesopotamia, but were driven out by the emperor Carus (282), and the frontier line as fixed by Septimius Severus was restored.

Although any serious loss of territory had been avoided, the storms of the 3d century had told with fatal effect upon the general condition of the empire. The “Roman j>eace” had vanished; not only the frontier territories, , but the central districts of Greece, Asia Minor, and even: Italy itself, had suffered from the ravages of war, and the fortification of Rome by Aurelian was a significant testimony to the altered condition of affairs. War, plague, and famine had thinned the Jiopulation and crippled the resources of the provinces. On all sides land was running waste, cities and towns were decaying, and commerce was paralysed. Only with the greatest difficulty were sufficient funds squeezed from the exhausted tax-payers to meet the increasing cost of the defence of the frontiers. The old established culture and civilization of the Mediterranean world rapidly declined, and the mixture of barbaric rudeness with Oriental pomj) and luxury which marked the court, even of the better emperors, such as Aurelian, was typical of the general deterioration, which was accelerated by the growing practice of settling barbarians on lands within the emj)ire, and of admitting them freely to service in the Roman army.

Period IL: 284-476 a.d. —(α) From the Accession of' Diocletian to the Death of Theodosius (284-395 a.d.).— The work begun by Aurelian and Probus, that of fortifying the empire alike against internal sedition and foreign invasion, was completed by Diocletian and Constantine the Great, whose system of government, novel as it appears at first sight, was in reality the natural and inevitable outcome of the history of the previous century. ^[507. Staatsvervj., r Verf. d. RornKReichs, Notitia Dignitatum, Italy and her Invaders, sq. Diocletian,] Its object was twofold, to give increased stability to the imperial authority itself, and to organize an efficient administrative machinery throughout the empire. In the second year of his reign Diocletian associated Maximian with himself as colleague, and six years later (292) the hands of the two “Augusti” were further strengthened by the proclamation of Constantius and Galerius as “Caesares.” Precedents for such an arrangement might have been quoted from the earlier history of the empire; ^[508. Staatsrecht, sq. op. cit.,] and the considerations in favour of it at the time were strong. It divided the overwhelming burdens and responsibilities of government, without sacrificing the unity of the empire; for, although to each of the Augusti and Caesars a separate sphere was assigned, the Caesars were subordinate to the higher authority of the Augusti, and over all his three colleagues Diocletian claimed to exercise a paramount control. It at least reduced the too familiar risk of a disputed succession by establishing in the two Caesars the natural successors to the higher position of Augusti, and finally it satisfied the jealous pride of the rival armies of the empire by giving them what they had so constantly claimed, imperatores of their own. The distribution of power between Diocletian and his colleagues followed those lines of division which the feuds of the previous century had only too clearly marked out. The armies of the Rhine, the Danube, and of Syria fell to the lot respectively of Constantius, Galerius, and Diocletian, the central districts of Italy and Africa to Maximian. ^[509.] A [9:20:778]second point in the new system was the complete and final emancipation of the imperial authority from all constitutional limitation and control. The last lingering traces of its republican origin disappear. The emperors from Diocletian onwards are autocrats in theory as well as in practice. The divided powers, the parallel jurisdictions, the defined prerogatives of the Augustan system have all vanished. There is but one legal authority throughout the empire, that of the emperor himself; and that authority is absolute. This avowed despotism Diocletian, following in the steps of Aurelian, hedged round with all the pomp and majesty of Oriental monarchy. The final adoption of the title “dominus,” so often rejected by earlier emperors, the diadem on the head, the robes of silk and gold, the replacement of the republican salutation of a fellow citizen by the adoring prostration even of the highest in rank before their lord and master, were all significant marks of tfie new regime. ^[510.] In the hands of this absolute ruler was placed the entire control of an elaborate administrative machinery. Most of the old local and national distinctions, privileges, and liberties which had once flourished within the empire had already disappeared under the levelling influence of imperial rule, and the levelling process was now completed. Roman citizenship had, since the edict of Caracalla, ceased to be the privilege of a minority. Diocletian finally reduced Italy and Rome to the level of the provinces: the provincial land-tax and provincial government were introduced into Italy, ^[511. Staatsverw.,] AvhileRome ceased to be even in name the seat of imperial authority. ^[512.] Throughout the whole area of the empire a uniform system of administration was established, the control of which was centred in the imperial palace, and in the confidential ministers who stood nearest the emperor’s person. ^[513. cfi Kotitia Dignitatum] Between the civil and military departments the separation was complete. At the head of the former, at least under the completed organization of Constantine, were the four prefects, ^[514.] next below them the “vicarii,” who had charge of the “dioceses,” below these again the governors of the separate provinces (“praesides,” “correctors,” “consulares”), ^[515. cfi Civil-Prozess, GescE d. Rom. Rechts, sq.] under each of whom was a host of minor officials. Parallel with this civil hierarchy of prefects, vicars, prae-sides, and smaller “officiales” was the series of military officers, from the “magistri militum,” the “duces,” and “comités” downwards. But the leading features of both are the same. In both there is the utmost possible subordination and division of authority. The subdivision of provinces, begun by the emperors of the 2d century, was systematically carried out by Diocletian, and either by Diocletian or by Constantine the legion was reduced to one-fifth of its former strength. ^[516. sq.] Each official, civil or military, was placed directly under the orders of a superior, and thus a continuous chain of authority connected the emperor with the meanest official in his service. Finally, the various grades in these two imperial services were care-

fully marked by the appropriation to each of distinctive titles, the highest being that of “illustris,” which was confined to the prefects and to the military magistri and comités, and to the chief ministers. ^[517. Kotitia Dignitatum.]

There can be little doubt that on the whole these reforms prolonged the existence of the empire, by creating a machinery which enabled the stronger emperors to utilize effectively all its available resources, and which even to some extent made good the deficiencies of weaker rulers. But in many points they failed to attain their object. Diocletian’s division of the imperial authority among colleagues, subject to the general control of the senior Augustus, was effectually discredited by the twenty years of almost constant conflict which followed his own abdication (305-323). Constantine’s partition of the empire among his three sons was not more successful in ensuring tranquillity, and in the final division of the East and West between Valens and Valentinian (364) the essential principle of Diocletian’s scheme, the maintenance of a single central authority, was abandoned. The “tyrants,” the curse of the 3d century, were far from unknown in the 4th, and their comparative paucity was due rather to the hold which the house of Constantine obtained upon the allegiance of their subjects than to the system of Diocletian. This system, moreover, while it failed altogether to remove some of the existing evils, aggravated others. The already overburdened financial resources of the empire were strained still further by the increased expenditure necessitated by the substitution of four imperial courts for one, and by the multiplication in every direction of paid officials. The gigantic bureaucracy of the 4th century proved, in spite of its undoubted services, an intolerable Aveight upon the energies of the empire. ^[518. op. eit., sq.]

Diocletian and Maximian formally abdicated their high office in 305. Eighteen years later Constantine, the sole survivor of six rival emperors, united the Avhole empire under his oavπ rule. His reign of fourteen years Avas marked by two events of first-rate importance,—the recognition of Christianity as the religion of the empire, ^[519. WeltgescE,] and the building of the new capital at Byzantium. The alliance Avhich Constantine inaugurated betAveen the Christian church and the imperial government, Avhile it enlisted on the side of the state one of the most powerful of the neAV forces with which it had to reckon, imposed a check, Avhich Avas in time to become a powerful one, on the imperial authority. The establishment of the new “City of Constantine” as a second Rome, Avith a second senate, a prefect of tbe city, regiones, and even largesses, did more than proclaim once again the deposition of Rome from her old imperial position. It paved the Avay for the final separation of East and West by providing the former for the first time with a suitable seat of government on the Bosphorus. The death of Constantine in 337 Avas folloAved, as the abdication of Diocletian had been, by the outbreak of quarrels among rival Caesars. Of the three sons of Constantine Avho in 337 divided the empire between them, Constantine the eldest fell in civil Avar against his brother Constans; Constans himself was, ten years afterwards, defeated and slain by Magnentius; and the latter in his turn Avas in 353 vanquished by Constantine’s only surviving son Constantius. Thus for the second ( time the Avhole empire Avas united under the rule of a * member of the house of Constantine. But in 355 Con[9:20:779]stantius reluctantly granted, the title of Caesar to his cousin Julian and placed him in charge of Gaul, where the momentary elevation of a tyrant, Silvanus, and still more the inroads of Franks and Alemanni, had excited alarm. But Julian’s successes during the next five years were such as to arouse the jealous fears of Constantius. In order to weaken his suspected rival the legions under Julian in Gaul were suddenly ordered to march eastward against the Persians (360). They refused, and when the order was repeated replied by proclaiming Julian himself emperor and Augustus. Julian, with probably sincere reluctance, accepted the position, but the death of Constantius in 361 saved the empire from the threatened civil war. The chief importance of the career of Julian, both as Caesar in Gaul from 355 to 361 and during his brief tenure of sole power (361-363), lies, so far as the general history of the empire is concerned, in his able defence of the Rhine frontier and in his Persian campaign; for his attempted restoration of pagan and in especial of Hellenic worships had no more permanent effect than the war which he courageously waged against the multitudinous abuses which had grown up in the luxurious court of Constantius. ^[520.] But his vigorous administration in Gaul undoubtedly checked the barbarian advance across the Rhine, and postponed the loss of the Western provinces, while, on the contrary, his campaign in Persia, brilliantly successful at first, resulted in his own death, and in the immediate surrender by his successor Jovian of the territories beyond the Tigris won by Diocletian seventy years before. Julian died on June 26, 363, his successor Jovian on February 17, 364; and on the 26th of February Valentinian was acknowledged as emperor by the army at Nicaea. In obedience to the expressed wish of the soldiers that he should associate a colleague with himself, he conferred the title of Augustus upon his brother Valens, and the long-impending division of the empire was at last effected,—Valentinian became emperor of the West, Valens of the East. From 364 till his death in 375 the vigour and ability of Valentinian kept his own frontier of the Rhine tolerably intact, and prevented any serious disasters on the Danube. But his death, which deprived the weaker Valens of a trusted counsellor and ally, was followed by a crisis on the Danube, more serious than any which had occurred there since the defeat of Decius. In 376 the Goths, hard pressed by their new foes from the eastward, the Huns, sought and obtained the protection of the Roman empire. They were transported across the Danube and settled in Mcesia, but, indignant at the treatment they received, they rose in arms against their protectors. In 378 at Hadrian-ople Valens was defeated and killed; the victorious Goths spread with fire and sword over Illyricum, and advanced eastward to the very walls of Constantinople. Once more, however, the danger passed away. The skill and tact of Theodosius, who had been proclaimed emperor of the East by Gratian, conciliated the Goths; they were granted an allowance, and in large numbers entered the service of the Roman emperor. The remaining years of Theodosius’s reign (382-395) were mainly engrossed by the duty which now devolved upon the emperor of the East of upholding the increasingly feeble authority of his colleague in the West against the attacks of pretenders. Maximus, the murderer of Gratian (383), was at first recognized by Theodosius as Caesar, and left in undisturbed command of Gaul, Spain, and Britain; but, when in 386 he proceeded to oust Valentinian II. from Italy and Africa, Theodosius marched westward, crushed him, and installed Valentinian as emperor of the West. In the very next year, however, the murder of Valentinian (392) by Arbogast, a Frank, was followed by the appearance of a fresh tyrant in the person of Eugenius, a domestic officer and nominee of Arbogast himself. Once more Theodosius marched westward, and near Aquileia decisively defeated his opponents. But his victory was quickly followed by his own illness and death (395), and the fortunes of East and West passed into the care of his two sons Arcadius and Honorius.

(ό) From the Heath of Theodosius to the Extinction of the Western Empire (395-476).—Through more than a century from the accession of Diocletian the Roman empire had succeeded in holding at bay the swarming hordes of barbarians. But, though no province had yet been lost, as Dacia had been lost in the century before, and though the frontier lines of the Rhine and the Danube were still guarded by Roman forts and troops, there were signs in plenty that a catastrophe was at hand.

From all the writers who deal with the 4th century comes the same tale of declining strength and energy. From Lactantius to Zosimus we have one long series of laments over the depression and misery of the provinces. To meet the increased expenditure necessary to maintain the legions, to pay the hosts of officials, and to keep up the luxurious splendour of the imperial courts, not only were the taxes raised in amount, but the most oppressive and inquisitorial methods were adopted in order to secure for the imperial treasury every penny that could be wrung from the wretched taxpayer. The results are seen in such pictures as that which the panegyrist Eumenius ^[521. Paneg. Vet., Juliani Opera sq.; Cf. Roman. Landschaften, sq.] draws of the state of Gaul (306-312) under Constantine, in the accounts of the same province under Julian fifty years later, in those given by Zosimus early in the 5th century, and in the stringent regulations of the Theodosian code, dealing with the assessment and collection of the taxes. Among the graver symptoms of economic ruin were the decrease of population, which seriously diminished not only the number of taxpayers, but the supply of soldiers for the legions; ^[522.] the spread of infanticide; the increase of waste lands whose owners and cultivators had fled to escape the tax collector; the declining prosperity of the towns; and the constantly recurring riots and insurrections, both among starving peasants, as in Gaul, ^[523. op. cit.,] and in populous cities like Antioch. ^[524.] The distress was aggravated by the civil wars, by the rapacity of tyrants, such as Maxentius and Maximus, but above all by the raids of the barbarians, who seized every opportunity afforded by the dissensions or incapacity of the emperors to cross the frontiers and harry the lands of the provincials. Constantine (306-312), Julian (356-360), and Valentinian I. (364-375) had each to give a temporary breathing space to Gaul by repelling the Franks and Alemanni. Britain was harassed by Picts and Scots from the north (367-370), while the Saxon pirates swept the Northern seas and the coasts both of Britain and Gaul. On the Danube the Quadi, Sarmatae, and above all the Goths, poured at intervals into the provinces of Pannonia and Moesia, and penetfated to Macedon and Thrace. In the East, in addition to the constant border feud with Persia, we hear of ravages by the Isaurian mountaineers, and by a new enemy, the Saracens. ^[525.]

Even more ominous of coming danger was the extent [9:20:780]to which the European half of the empire was becoming barbarized. The policy which had been inaugurated by Augustus himself of settling barbarians within the frontiers had been taken up on a larger scale and in a more systematic way by the Illyrian emperors of the 3d century, and was continued by their successors in the 4th. In Gaul, in the provinces south of the Danube, even in Macedon and Italy, large barbarian settlements had been made—Theodosius in particular distinguishing himself by his liberality in this respect. Nor did the barbarians admitted during the 4th century merely swell the class of half-servile coloni. On the contrary, they not only constituted to an increasing extent the strength of the imperial forces, but won their way in ever-growing numbers to posts of dignity and importance in the imperial service. Under Constantine the palace was crowded with Franks. ^[526.] Julian led Gothic troops against Persia, and the army with which Theodosius defeated the tyrant Maximus (388) contained large numbers of Huns and Alans, as well as of Goths. The names of Arbogast, Stilicho, and Rufinus are sufficient proof of the place held by barbarians near the emperor’s person and in the control of the provinces and legions of Rome; and the relations of Arbogast to his nominee for the purple, Eugenius, were an anticipation of those which existed between Ricimer and the emperors of the latter half of the 5th century.

It was by barbarians already settled within the empire that the first of the series of attacks which finally separated the Western provinces from the empire and set up a barbaric ruler in Italy were made, ^[527. Italy and her Invaders, i. Histoire des Empereurs, Latin Christianity, Trois Ministres des fils de Theodose Histoire d’Attila Weltgeschichte, sq.} GescF d. Völkerwanderung.] and it was in men of barbarian birth that Rome found her ablest and most successful defenders, and the emperors both of East and West their most capable and powerful ministers. The Visigoths whom Alaric led into Italy had been settled south of the Danube as the allies of the empire since the accession of Theodosius. The greater part of them were Christians at least in name, and Alaric himself had stood high in tho favour of Theodosius. The causes which set them in motion are tolerably clear. Like the Germans of the days of Caesar, they wanted land for their own, and to this land-hunger was evidently added in Alaric’s own case the ambition of raising himself to the heights which had been reached before him by the Vandal Stilicho at Ravenna and the Goth Rufinus at Constantinople. The jealousy which existed between the rulers of the Western and Eastern empires furthered his plans. In the name of Arcadius, the emperor of the East, or at least with the connivance of Arcadius’s minister Rufinus, he occupied the province of Illyricum, and from thence ravaged Greece, which according to the existing division of provinces belonged to the Western empire. Thence in 396 he retreated before Stilicho to Illyricum, with the command of which he was now formally invested by Arcadius, and which gave him the best possible starting point for an attack on Italy. ^[528. op. eit.,] In 400 he led his people, with their wives and families, their waggons and treasure, to seek lands for themselves south of the Alps. But in this first invasion he penetrated no farther than the plains of Lombardy, and after the desperate battle of Pollentia

(402) ^[529.] he slowly withdrew from Italy, his retreat being hastened by the promises of gold freely made to him by the imperial government. Not until the autumn of 408 did Alaric again cross the Alps. Stilicho was dead; the barbarian troops in Honorius’s service had been provoked into joining Alaricby the insane anti-Teutonic policy of Honorius and his ministers, and Alaric marched unopposed to Rome. This time, however, the payment of a heavy ransom saved the city. Several months of negotiation followed between Alaric and the court of Ravenna. Alaric’s demands were moderate, but Honorius would grant neither lands for his people nor the honourable post in the imperial service which he asked for himself. Once more /Vlaric sat down before Rome, and this time the panic-stricken citizens discovered a fresh mode of escape. Attalus, a Greek, the prefect of the city, was declared Augustus, and Alaric accepted the post of commander-inchief. But the incapacity of Attalus was too much for the patience of his barbarian minister and patron, and after a few months’ reign Alaric formally deposed him and renewed his offers to Honorius. Again, however, they were declined, and Alaric marched to the siege and sack of Rome (410). ^[530. Weltgescli.,] His death followed hard on his capture of Rome. Two years later (412) his successor Ataulf led the Yisigoths to find in Gaul the lands which Alaric had sought in Italy. It is characteristic of the anarchical condition of the West that Ataulf and his Goths should have fought for Honorius in Gaul against the tyrants, ^[531. English Historical Review] and in Spain against the Vandals, Suevi, and Alani; and it was with the consent of Honorius that in 419 Wallia, who had followed Ataulf as king of the Visigoths, finally settled with his people in south-western Gaul and founded the Visigothic monarchy. ^[532.]

It was about the same period that the accomplished fact of the division of Spain between the three barbarian tribes of Vandals, Suevi, and Alani was in a similar manner recognized and approved by the paramount authority of the emperor of the West. ^[533. Die Romanische LandschaJten, sq.] These peoples had crossed the Rhine at the time when Alaric was making his first attempt on Italy. A portion of the host led by Radagaisus ^[534.] actually invaded Italy, but were cut to pieces by Stilicho near Florence (405); the rest pressed on through Gaul, crossed the Pyrenees, and entered the as yet untouched province of Spain.

Honorius died in 423. His authority had survived the dangers to which it had been exposed alike from the rivalry of tyrants and barbaric invasion, and with the single exception of Britain ^[535.] lθ no province had yet formally broken loose from the empire. But over a great part of the West this authority was now little more than nominal; throughout the major part of Gaul and in Spain the barbarians had settled, and barbarian states were growing up which still recognized the paramount supremacy of the emperor, but were in all essentials independent of his control. The question for the future was whether this relationship between the declining imperial authority and the vigorous young states which had planted the seeds of a fresh life in the provinces would be maintained.

The long reign of Valentinian III. (423-455) is marked [9:20:781]by two events of first-rate importance,—the conquest of Africa by the Vandals ^[536. Gesch. d. Vandal. Herrschaft in Africa.] and the invasion of Gaul and Italy by Attila. The Vandal settlement in Africa was closely akin in its origin and results to those of the Visigoths and of the Vandals themselves in Gaid and Spain. Here as there the occasion was given by the jealous quarrels of powerful imperial ministers. The feud between Boniface, count of Africa, and Aetius, the “master-general” or “count of Italy,” opened the way to Africa for the Vandal king Gaiseric (Genseric), as that between Stilicho and Rufinus had before set Alaric in motion westward, and as the quarrel between the tyrant Constantine and the ministers of Honorius had paved the way for the Vandals, Sueves, and Alans into Spain. In this case too, as in the others, the hunger for more land and treasure was the impelling motive with the barbarian invader, and in Africa, as in Gaul and Spain, the invaders’ acquisitions were confirmed by the imperial authority which they still professed to recognize. It was in 429 that Gai-seric, king of the Vandals, crossed with his warriors, their families and goods, to the province of Africa, a province hitherto almost as untouched as Spain by the ravages of war. Thanks to the quarrels of Boniface and Aetius their task was an easy one. The defenceless province was easily and quickly overrun. In 435 ^[537.] a formal treaty secured them in the possession of a large portion of the rich lands which were the granary of Rome, in exchange for a payment probably of corn and oil. Carthage was taken in 439, and by 440 the Vandal kingdom was firmly established.

Eleven years later (451) Attila invaded Gaul, but this Hunnish movement was in a variety of ways different from those of the Visigoths and Vandals. Nearly a century had passed since the Huns first appeared in Europe, and drove the Goths to seek shelter within the Roman lines. Attila was now the ruler of a great empire in central and northern Europe, ^[538. Fragm. Hist. Gr.,] and, in addition to his own Huns, the German tribes along the Rhine and Danube and far away to the north owned him as king. He confronted the Roman power as an equal; and, in marked contrast to the Gothic and Vandal chieftains, he treated with the emperors of East and West as an independent sovereign. His advance on Gaul and Italy threatened, not the establishment of yet one more barbaric chieftain on Roman soil, but the subjugation of the civilized and Christian West to the rule of a heathen and semi-barbarous conqueror. But Rome now reaped the advantages of the policy which Honorius had perhaps involuntarily followed. The Visigoths in Gaul, Christian and already half Romanized, rallied to the aid of the empire against a common foe. Attila, defeated at Chalons ^[539. sq.;] by Aetius, withdrew into Pannonia (451). In the next year he overran Lombardy, but penetrated no farther south, and in 453 he died. With the murder of Valentinian III. (453) the western branch of the house of Theodosius came to an end, and the next twenty years witnessed the accession and deposition of nine emperors. The three months’ rule of Maximus is memorable only for the invasion of Italy and the sack of Rome by the Vandals under Gaiseric. From 456-472 the actual ruler of Italy was Ricimer, the Sueve. Of the four emperors whom he placed on the throne, Majorian (457-461) alone played any imperial part outside Italy. ^[540.] Ricimer died in 472, and two years later a Pannonian, Orestes, aspired to fill the place which Ricimer had occupied. Julius Nepos was deposed, and Orestes filled the vacancy by proclaiming as Augustus his own son Romulus. But Orestes’s tenure of power was brief. The barbarian mercenaries in Italy determined to secure for themselves a position there such as that which their kinsfolk had won in Gaul and Spain and Africa. Their demand for a third of the lands of Italy was refused by Orestes, ^[541.] and they instantly rose in revolt. On the defeat and death of Orestes they proclaimed their leader, Odoacer the Rugian, ^[542.] king of Italy. Romulus Augustulus laid down his imperial dignity, and the court at ConStantinople was informed that there was no longer an emperor of the West. ^[543. Fragm. Hist. Gr.,]

The installation of a barbarian king in Italy was the natural climax of the changes which had been taking place in the West throughout the 5th century. In Spain, Gaul, and Africa barbarian chieftains were already established as kings. In Italy, for the last twenty years, the real power had been wielded by a barbarian officer. Odoacer, when he decided to dispense with the nominal authority of an emperor of the West, placed Italy on the same level of independence with the neighbouring provinces. But the old ties with Rome were not severed. The new king of Italy formally recognized the supremacy of the one Roman emperor at Constantinople, and was invested in return with the rank of “patrician,” which had been held before him by Aetius and Ricimer. In Italy too, as in Spain and Gaul, the laws, the administrative system, and the language remained Roman. ^[544. sq. Holy Roman Empire,] But the emancipation of Italy and the Western provinces from direct imperial control, which is signalized by Odoacer’s accession, has rightly been regarded as marking the opening of a new epoch. It made possible in the West the development of a Romano-German civilization; it facilitated the growth of new and distinct states and nationalities ;'it gave a new impulse to the influence of the Christian church, and laid the foundations of the power of the bishops of Rome.

Section II.— History of the Roman Republic in the Middle Ages.

The history of the Roman republic during the Middle Ages has yet to be written, and only by the discovery of new documents can the difficulties of the task be completely overcome. Although very different in its origin, the Roman republic gradually assumed the same form as the other Italian communes, and with almost identical institutions. But, owing to the special local conditions amid which it arose, it maintained a distinct physiognomy and character. The deserted Campagna surrounding the city checked any notable increase of trade or industry, and prevented the establishment of the guilds on the solid footing that elsewhere made them the basis and support of the commune. There was also the continual and oppressive influence of the empire, and, above all, the presence of the papacy, which often appeared to absorb the entire vitality of the city. At such moments the commune seemed annihilated, but it speedily revived and reasserted itself. Consequently there are many apparent gaps in its history, and we have often extreme difficulty in discovering the invisible links connecting the visible fragments.

Even the aristocracy of Rome had a special stamp. In the other republics, excepting Venice, it was feudal, of German origin, and in perpetual conflict with the popular and commercial elements which sought its destruction. The history of municipal freedom lay in this struggle. But the infiltration of Teutonic and feudal elements broke up the ancient aristocracy of Rome, and left it at the mercy of the people. Then the popes, by the bestow τ al of lucrative posts, rich benefices, and vast estates, and, above all, by raising many nobles to the purple, introduced new blood into the Roman aristocracy, and endued it with increasing strength and vitality. Always divided, always turbulent, this irrepressible body was a continual source of discord and civil war, of permanent confusion and turmoil. Amidst all these difficulties the commune struggled on, but never succeeded in long preserving a regular course or administration. What with continual warfare, attacks on the Capitol, and consequent slaughter, pillage, and incendiarism, it is no wonder that so few original documents are left to illustrate the history of the Roman republic. Nor have chroniclers and historians done much to supply this want, since, in treating of Roman affairs, their attention is mainly devoted to the pope and the emperor. Nevertheless we will attempt to connect in due order all the facts gleaned from former writers and published records.

The removal of the seat of the empire to Constantinople effected a radical change in the political situation of Rome; nor was this change neutralized by the formation of the weak Western empire soon to be shattered by the Germanic invasions. But we still find Roman laws and institutions; and no sign is yet manifest of the rise of a mediaeval municipality. The earliest germ of one is seen during the barbarian invasions. Of these we need only enumerate the four most important,—those of the Goths, Byzantines, Lombards, and Franks. The Gothic rule merely superposed upon the Roman social order a Teutonic stratum, that never penetrated beneath its surface. The Goths always remained a conquering army; according to the German custom, they took possession of one third of the vanquished territory, but, while forbidding the Romans to bear arms, left their local administration intact. The senate, the curiae, the principal magistrates, both provincial and municipal, the prefect of the city, and the Roman judges enforcing the enactments of the Roman law were all preserved. Already, under the empire, the civil power had been separated from the military, and this separation was maintained. Hence there was no visible change in the constitution of the state. Only, now there were conquered and conquerors. All real and effective power was on the side of brute force, and the Goths alone bore arms. In every province they had their comites, or heads of the army, who had judicial power over their countrymen, especially in criminal cases. Here then was a combination of civil and military jurisdiction altogether contrary to the Roman idea. Nor can it be denied that the comités, as chiefs of the armed force, necessarily exerted a direct or indirect influence on the civil and administrative power of the provinces, and especially upon the collection of the imposts. The civil arm, being virtually subordinate to the military, suffered unavoidable change. Notwithstanding the praise lavished on Theodoric, the kingdom founded by him in Italy had no solid basis. It was composed of two nations differing in race and traditions and even in religion, since the Goths were Arians and the Romans Catholics. The latter were sunk in degeneracy and corruption; their institutions were old and decrepit. It was necessary to infuse new life into the worn-out body. This was difficult, perhaps impossible; and at any rate Theodoric never attempted the task. Little wonder then if the Gothic kingdom succumbed to the Byzantine hordes from Constantinople.

The wars of Belisarius and Narses against the Goths lasted twenty years (535-555 a.d.), Causedterribleslaughter and devastation in Italy, and finally subjected her to Constantinople. In place of a Gothic king she was now ruled by a Greek patrician, afterwards entitled the exarch, who had his seat of government at Ravenna as lieutenant of the empire. In the chief, provincial cities the ruling counts were replaced by dukes, subordinate to the exarch; and the smaller towns were governed by military tribunes. Instead of dukes, we sometimes find magistm militum, apparently of higher rank. The praefectus praetorio of Italy, likewise a dependant of the exarch, was at the head of the civil administration. The pragmatic sanction (554), promulgating the Justinian code, again separated the civil from the military power, which was no longer allowed to intervene in the settlement of private disputes, and, by conferring on the bishops the superintendence of and authority over the provincial and municipal government, soon led to the increase of the power of the church, which had already considerable influence.

The new organization outwardly resembled that of the Goths: one army had been replaced by another, the counts by dukes; there was an exarch instead of a king; the civil and military jurisdictions were more exactly defined. But the army was not, like that of the Goths, a conquering nation in arms; it was a Graeco-Roman army, and did not hold a third of the territory which was now probably added to the possessions of the state. The soldiery took its pay from Constantinople, whence all instructions and appointments of superior officers likewise proceeded. In Rome we find a mαgister militum at the head of the troops. The Roman senate still existed, but was reduced to a shadow. Theodoric had left it intact until he suspected it of hostile designs and dealings with the Byzantines, but then began to persecute it, as was proved by the wretched fate of Boetius and Symmachus. Nevertheless the senate survived, added the functions of a curia or municipal council to those of a governmental assembly, and took part in the election of the pope—already one of the chief affairs of Rome. So many senators, however, were slaughtered during the Byzantine war that it was commonly believed to be extinct. The pragmatic sanction, conferring on senate and pope the superintendence of weights and measures in Italy, is a convincing proof to the contrary, although, in the general chaos, now that [9:20:783]Rome was a mere provincial city, constantly exposed to attack, we may imagine to what the senate was reduced.

All Roman institutions were altered and decayed; but their original features were still to be traced, and no heterogeneous element had been introduced into them. The first dawn of a completely new epoch can only be dated from the invasion of the Lombards (568-572). Their conquest of a large portion of Italy was accompanied by the harshest oppression. They abolished all ancient laws and institutions, and not only seized a third of the lands, but reduced the inhabitants to almost utter slavery. But, in the unsubdued parts of the country—namely, in Ravenna, Rome, and the maritime cities—a very different state of things prevailed. The necessity for self-defence and the distance of the empire, now too worn out to render any assistance, compelled the inhabitants to depend solely on their own strength. Thus, certain maritime cities, such as Naples, Amalfi, Pisa, and Venice, soon attained to a greater or less degree of liberty and independence.

A special state of things now arose in Rome. We behold the rapid growth of the papal power and the continual increase of its moral and political influence. This had already begun under Leo I., and been further promoted by the pragmatic sanction. Not only the superintendence but often the nomination of public functionaries and judges was now in the hands of the popes. And the accession to St Peter’s chair of a man of real genius in the person of Gregory I., surnamed the Great, marked the commencement of a new era. By force of individual character, as well as by historic necessity, this pope became the most potent personage in Rome. Power fell naturally into his hands; he was the true representative of the city, the born defender of church and state. His ecclesiastical authority, already great throughout Italy, was specially great in the Roman diocese and in southern Italy. The continual offerings of the faithful had previously endowed the church with enormous possessions in the province of Rome, in Sicily, Sardinia, and other parts. The administration of all this property soon assumed the shape of a small government council in Rome. This protected and succoured the oppressed, settled disputes, nominated judges, and controlled the ecclesiastical authorities. The use made by the pope of his revenues greatly contributed to the increase of his moral and political authority. When the city was besieged by the Lombards, and the emperor left his army unpaid, Gregory supplied the required funds and thus made resistance possible. And, when the defence could be no longer maintained, he alone, by the weight of his personal influence and the payment of large sums, induced the Lombards to raise the siege. He negotiated in person with Agilulph, and was recognized by him as the true representative of the city. Thus Rome, after being five times taken and sacked by the barbarians, was, on this occasion, saved by its bishop. The exarch, although unable to give any help, protested against the assumption of so much authority by the pope; but Gregory was no usurper, and his attitude was the natural result of events. “For twenty-seven years”—-so wrote this pontiff to the imperial government of Constantinople—“we lived in terror of the Longobards, nor can I say what sums we had to pay them. There is an imperial treasurer with the army at Ravenna; but here it is I who am treasurer. Likewise I have to provide for the clergy, the poor, and the people, and even to succour the distress of other churches.”

It was at this moment that the new Roman commune began to take shape and acquire increasing vigour owing to its distance from the seat of the empire and its resistance to the Lombard besiegers. Its special character was now to be traced in the preponderance of the military over the civil power. A Roman element had penetrated into the army, which was already possessed of considerable political importance. The prefect of Rome loses authority and seems almost a nullity compared with the magister militum. Hardly anything is heard of the senate. “Quia enim Senatus deest, populus interiit,” exclaims Gregory in a moment of despair. The popes now make common cause with the people against the Lombards on the one hand and the emperor on the other. But they avoid an absolute rupture with the empire, lest they should have to face the Lombard power without any prospect of help. I^ater, when the growing strength of the commune becomes menacing, they remain faithful to the empire in order not to be at the mercy of the people. It was a permanent feature of their policy never to allow the complete independence of the city until they should be its sole and absolute masters. But that time was still in the future. Meanwhile pope and people joined in the defence of their common interests.

This alliance was cemented by the religious disputes of the East and the West. First came the Monothelite controversy regarding the twofold nature of Christ. In order to compel obedience to his edict, the emperor commanded the exarch to take energetic measures, and, provided he could secure the favour of the Roman army, to actually seize the person of Pope Martin I. (649-654). A long and violent struggle ensued, in which the people of Rome and of other Italian cities sided so vigorously with the popes that John VI. (701-705) had to interpose in order to release the exarch from captivity and prevent a definitive rupture with the empire. Later (710-711) Ravenna revolted against the emperor, organized its armed population under twelve flags, and almost all the cities of the exarchate joined in a resistance that was the first step towards the independence of the Italian communes. A still fiercer religious quarrel then broke out concerning images. Pope Gregory II. (715-731) opposed the celebrated edict of the iconoclastic emperor Leo the Isaurian. Venice and the Pentapolis took up arms in favour of the pope, and elected dukes of their own without applying to the emperor. Again public disorder rose to such a pitch that the pope was obliged to check it lest it should go too far.

In the midst of these warlike tumults a new constitution, almost a new state, was being set up in Rome. During the conflict with Philippicus, the Monothelite and heretical emperor who ascended the throne in 711, the Liber Pontificalis makes the first mention of the duchy of Rome (fiucatus Romanae urbis), and we find the people struggling to elect a duke of their own. In the early days of the Byzantine rule the territory appertaining to the city was no greater than under the Roman empire. But, partly through the weakness of the government of Constantinople, and above all through the decomposition of the Italian provinces under the Lombards, who destroyed all unity of government in the peninsula, this dukedom was widely extended, and its limits were always changing in accordance with the course of events. It was watered by the Tiber, and stretched into Tuscia to the right, starting from the mouth of the Marta, by Tolfa and Bleda, and reaching as far as Orte. Viterbo was a frontier city of the Lombards. On the left the duchy extended into Latium as far as the Garigliano. It spread very little to the north-east and was badly defended on that side, inasmuch as the duchy of Spoleto reached to within fourteen miles of the Salara gate. On the other side, towards Umbria, the river Nera was its boundary line.

The constitution of the city now begins to show the [9:20:784]results of the conditions amid which it took shape. The separation of the civil from the military power has entirely disappeared. This is proved by the fact that, after the year 600, there is no further mention of the prefect. His office still survived, but with a gradual change of functions, until, in the 8th century, he once more appears as president of a criminal tribunal. The constitution of the duchy and of the new republic formed during the wars with the IjOmbards and the exarch was substantially of an aristocratico-military nature. At its head was the duke, first elected by the emperor, then by the pope and the people, and, as his strength and influence grew with those of the commune, he gradually became the most respected and powerful personage iu Rome. The duke inhabited the palace of the Caesars on the Palatine Hill, and had both the civil and the military power in his hands; he was at the head of the army, which, being composed of the best citizens and highest nobility of Rome, was a truly national force. This army was styled the felicissimus or Jlorens exercitus Romanus or also the militia Romana. Its members never lost their citizen stamp; on the contrary they formed the true body of the citizens. We find mention of other duxes in Rome, but these were probably other leaders or superior officers of the army. Counts and tribunes are found in the subject cities bound to furnish aid to the capital. In fact during the pontificate of Sergius II. (844), when the duchy was threatened by a Saracenic invasion, they were requested to send troops to defend the coast, and as many soldiers as possible to the city.

At that time the inhabitants of Rome were divided into four principal classes—clergy, nobles, soldiers, and simple citizens. The nobles were divided into two categories, first the genuine optimates, i.e., members of old and wealthy families with large estates, and filling high, and often hereditary, offices in the state, the church, and the army. These were styled proceres and primates. The second category comprised landed proprietors, of moderate means but exalted position, mentioned as nobiles by Gregory L, and constituting in fact a numerous petty nobility and the bulk of the army. Next followed the citizens, i.e., the commercial class, merchants, and craftsmen, who, having as yet no fixed organization and but little influence, were simply designated as honxsti cives. These, however, were quite distinct from the plebeians, plebs, vulgus populi, viri humiles, who in their turn ranked above bondsmen and slaves. The honesti cives did not usually form part of the army, and were only enrolled in it in seasons of emergency. Nevertheless the army was not only national, but became increasingly democratic, so that in the IOth century it included every class of inhabitants except churchmen and slaves. At that period we sometimes find the whole people designated as the exercitus, those actually under arms being distinguished as the militia exercitus Romani. This again was divided into bands or “numbers,” t.β., regiments, and also, in a manner peculiar to Rome, into scholae militurn. These scholae were associations derived from antiquity, gaining strength and becoming more general in the Middle Ages as the central power of the state declined. There were scholae of notaries, of church singers, and of nearly every leading employment; there were scholae of foreigners of diverse nationalities, of Franks, Lombards, Greeks, Saxons, Ac. Even the trades and crafts began to form scholae. These were at first very feeble institutions, and only later gained importance and became guilds. As early as the 8th century there vzere scholae militurn in the army, which was thus doubly divided. But we have no precise definition of their functions. They were de facto corporations with separate property, churches, and magistrates of their own. The latter were always optimates, and guarded the interests of the army. But the real chiefs of the bands or numeri were the duces or tribunes, and under the Franks the latter became comités. These chiefs were styled magnijici consules, optimates de militia, often too Pudixes de militia, since, as was the custom of the Middle Ages, they wielded political and judicial as well as military authority. The title of consul was now generally given to superior officers, whether civil or military. The importance of the scholae militurn began to decline in the IOth century; towards the middle of the 12th they disappeared altogether, and, according to Papencordt, were last mentioned in 1145. It is probable that the scholae militurn signified local divisions of the army, corresponding with the city wards, which were twelve in number during the IOth and Ilth centuries, then increased to thirteen, and occasionally to fourteen. It is certain that from the beginning the army was distributed under twelve flags; after the scholae had disappeared, we find it classified in districts, which were subdivided into companies. The division of cities into quarters, Sestieri or rwni, corresponding with that of the army, and also with that of the municipal government, was the common practice of Florence, Siena, and almost all the Italian communes. But, while usually losing importance as the guilds acquired power, in Rome the insignificance of the guilds added to the strength of the regioni or rwni, which not only became part of the army but finally grasped the reins of government. This was a special characteristic of the political constitution of the Roman commune.

We now come to a question of weightier import for ι all desiring to form a clear idea of the Roman government at that period. What had become of the senate? It had undoubtedly lost its original character now that the empire was extinct. But, after much learned discussion, historical authorities are still divided upon the subject. Certain Italian writers of the 18th century— Vendettini, for example—asserted with scanty critical insight that the Roman senate did not disappear in the Middle Ages. The same opinion backedby much learned research was maintained by the great German historian Savigny. And Leo, while denying the persistence of the curia in Lombard Italy, adhered to Savigny’s views as regarded Rome. Papencordt did the same, but held the Roman senate to be no more than a curia. This judgment was vigorously contested, first by Hegel and Giesebrecht, then by Gregorovius. These writers believe that after the middle of the 6th century the senate had a merely nominal existence. According to Gregorovius its last appearance was in the year 579. After that date it is mentioned in no documents, and the chroniclers are either equally silent or merely allude to its decay and extinction. In the 8th century, however, the terms senator, senαtores, senatus again reappear. We find letters addressed to Pippin, beginning thus: Omvis senatus atque Universi populi geηeralitas. When Leo III. returned from Germany he was met by tam proceres cleri-corum cum omnibus clericis, quamque optimates et senatus, Cunctaque militia (see Anastasius, in Muratori, vol. iii. 198 c). But it has been noted that the senate was never found to act as a political assembly; on occasions when it might have been mentioned in that capacity we hear nothing of it, and only meet with it in ceremonials and purely formal functions. Hence the conclusion that the term senator was used in the sense of noble, senatus of nobility, and no longer referred to an institution but only to a class of the citizens. Even when we find that Otho III. (who sought to revive all the ancient institutions of Rome) addressed an edict to the “Consuls and Senate of Rome,” and read that the laws of St Stephen [9:20:785]were issued senatus decreto, the learned Giesebrecht merely remarks that no important changes in the Roman constitution are to be attributed to the consuls and senate introduced by Otho III. Thus for the next glimpse of the senate we must pass to the 12th century, when it was not only reformed, as some writers believe, but entirely reconstituted.

But in this case a serious difficulty remains to be disposed of. Gregorovius firmly asserts that the nobles acquired great power between the 7th and IOth centuries, not only filling the highest military, judicial, and ecclesiastical offices, “but also directing the municipal government, presumably with the prefect at their head.” He further adds :—“Notwithstanding the disappearance of the senate, it is difficult to suppose that the city was without governing magistrates, or without a council.” Thus, after the 7th century, the optimates at the head of the army were also at the head of the citizens, and “formed a communal council in the same manner in which it was afterwards formed by the banderesi. ^[545. Geschichte,] Now, if the nobles were called senatores, and the nobility senatus, and if this body of nobles met in council to administer the affairs of the republic, there is no matter for dispute, inasmuch as all are agreed that the original senate must have had a different character from the senate of the Aliddle Ages. And, since the absence of all mention of a prefect after the 7th century is not accepted as a proof of his non-existence, and we find him reappear under another form in the 8th century, so the silence as to the senate after the year 579, the fresh mention of it in the 8th century, and its reappearance in the 12th as a firmly reconstituted body reasonably lead to the inference that, during that time, the ancient senate had been gradually transformed into the new council. Its meetings must have been held very irregularly, and probably only in emergencies when important affairs had to be discussed, previously to bringing them before the parliament or general assembly of the people. Historians are better agreed as to the significance of the term consul. At first this was simply a title of honour bestowed on superior magistrates, and retained that meaning from the 7th to the Ilth century, but was then—as in other Italian cities—only given to the chief officer of the state.

During this period the Roman constitution was very simple. The duke, commanding the army, and the prefect, presiding over the criminal court, were the chiefs of the republic; the armed nobility constituted the forces, filled all superior offices, and occasionally met in a council called the senate, though it had no resemblance to the senate of older times. In moments of emergency a general parliament of the people was convoked. This constitution differed little from that of the other Italian communes, where, in the same way, we find all the leading citizens under arms, a parliament, a council, and one or more chiefs at the head of the government.

But Rome had an element that was lacking elsewhere. We have already noted that, in the provinces, the administrators of church lands were important personages, and exercised during the AIiddle Ages, when there was no exact division of power, both judicial and political functions. It was very natural that the heads of this vast administration resident in Rome should have a still higher standing, and in fact, from the 6th century, their power increased to such an extent that in the times of the Franks they already formed a species of papal cabinet with .a share and sometimes a predominance in the affairs of the republic. There were seven principal administrators, but two of them held the chief power,—the primicerius Hotariorum and the Secundicerius, i.e., the first. and under secretaries of state. AVhen, on the constitution of the new empire, these ministers were declared to be palatine or imperial as well as papal officials, the primicerius and the Secundicerius were also in waiting on the emperor, who sat in council with them, when in Rome. Next came the arcarius, Ortreasurer; the Sacellarius, or cashier; theproto-Scriniarius, who was at the head of the papal chancery; the primus defensor, who was the advocate of the church, and administered its possessions. Seventh and last came the Homenclator, or admiηiculator, who pleaded the cause of widows, orphans, and paupers. There were also some other officials, such as the vestianus, the Vicedominus or steward, the cubicularius or majordomo, but these were of inferior importance. They were ecclesiastics, but not bound to be in priest’s orders. The first seven were those specially known as proceres clericorum and often er still as judices de clero, since they speedily assumed judicial functions and ranked among the chief judges of Rome. But as ecclesiastics they did not give decisions in criminal cases. Thus Rome had two tribunals, that of ike judices de clero, or Ordinarii, presided over by the pope, and that of the judices de militia, leaders of the army, dukes and tribunes, also bearing the generic title of consuls. First appointed by the exarch and then frequently by the pope, these decided both civil and criminal cases. In the latter they were sole judges under the presidency of the prefect.

The pope was thus at the head of a large administrative body with judicial and civil powers that were continually on the increase, and, in addition to his moral authority over Christendom, was possessed of enormous revenues. So in course of time he considered himself the real representative of the Roman republic. Gregory II. (715-731) accepted in the name of the republic the submission of other cities, and protested against the conquest by the Lombards of those already belonging to Rome. He seemed indeed to regard the territory of the duchy as the patrimony of the church. The duke was always at the head of the army, and, officially, was always held to be an imperial magistrate. But the empire was now powerless in Italy. Aleanwhile the advance of the Lombards was becoming more and more threatening; they seized Ravenna in 751, thus putting an end to the exarchate, and next marched towards Rome, which had only its own forces and the aid of neighbouring cities to rely upon. To avoid being crushed by the brute force of a foreign nation unfit to rule, and only capable of oppression and pillage, it was necessary to make an energetic stand.

Accordingly the reigning pope, Stephen II. (752-757), appealed to Pippin, king of the Franks, and concluded with that monarch an alliance destined to inaugurate a new epoch of the world’s history. The pope consecrated Pippin king of the Franks, and named him patricius Romanorum. This title, as introduced by Constantine, had no longer the ancient meaning, but now became a sign of lofty social rank. AVhen, however, it was afterwards conferred on barbarian chieftains such as Odoacer and Theodoric, and then on the representative of the Byzantine empire in Italy, it acquired the meaning of a definite dignity or office. In fact the title was now given to Pippin as defender of the church, for the pope styled him at the same time patricius Romanorum and defensor or protector ecclesiae. And the king pledged himself not only to defend the church but also to wrest the exarchate and the Pentapolis from the Lombards and give them to Rome, or rather to the pope, which came to the same thing. This was considered as a restitution made to the head of the church, who was also the representative of the republic and the empire. And, to preserve the character of a restitution, the famous “donation of Constantine” was invented during this period (752[9:20:786]777). Pippin brought his army to the rescue (754-755)

and fulfilled his promise. The pope accepted the donation in the name of St Peter, and as the visible head of the church. Thus in 755 central Italy broke its connexion with the empire and became independent; thus was inaugurated the temporal power of the papacy, the cause of so much subsequent warfare and revolution in Rome.

Its first consequences were speedily seen. In 767 the death of Paul I. was followed by a fierce revolt of the nobles under Duke Toto (Theodoro) of Nepi, who by violent means raised his brother Constantine to the chair of St Peter, although Constantine was a layman and had first to be ordained. For more than a year the new pontiff was a pliable tool in the hands of Toto and of the nobles. But the genuine papal faction, headed by a few judices de clero, asked the aid of the Lombards and made a formidable resistance. Their adversaries were defeated, tortured, and put to death. Toto was treacherously slain during a fight. The pope was blinded and left half dead on the highway. Fresh and no less violent riots ensued, owing to the public dread lest the new pope, Stephen IV. (768-772), elected by favour of the Lombards, should give them the city in return. But Stephen went over to the Franks, whom he had previously deserted, and his successor, Hadrian I. (772-795), likewise adhered to their cause, called the city to arms to resist king Desiderius and his Lombard hordes, and besought the assistance of Charlemagne. This monarch accordingly made a descent into

• Italy in 773, and not only gained an easy victory over Desiderius, but destroyed the Lombard kingdom and seized the iron crown. Entering Rome for the first time in 774, he confirmed and augmented the donation of Pippin by the addition of the dukedom of Spoleto. He returned several times to Italy and Rome, making new conquests and fresh concessions to Adrian L, until the death of the latter in 795.

The position of Rome and of the pope is now substantially changed. Duke, prefect, militia, and the people exist as heretofore, but are all subordinate to the head of the church, who, by the donations of Pippin and Charlemagne, has been converted into a powerful temporal sovereign. Henceforth all connexion with Byzantium is broken off, but Rome is still the mainspring of the empire, the Roman duchy its sole surviving fragment in Italy, and the pope stands before the world as representative of both. And, although it is difficult to determine how this came about, the pope is now regarded aud regards himself as master of Rome. In the year 772 he entrusts the Vestiarius with judicial powers over the laity, ecclesiastics, freemen, and slaves nostrae Romanae reipublicae. He writes to Charlemagne that he has issued orders for the burning of the Greek ships employed in the slave trade, “in our city of Civita Vecchia” (Centumcelke), and he always speaks of Rome and the Romans as “our city,” “our republic,” “our people.” The donations of Pippin and Charlemagne are restitutions made to Saint Peter, the holy church, and the republic at the same time. It is true that Charlemagne held the supreme power, had an immensely increased authority, and actively fulfilled his duties as patricius. But his power was only occasionally exercised in Rome; it was the result of services rendered to the church, and of the church’s continual need of his help; it was, as it were, the power of a mighty and indispensable ally. The pope, however, was most tenacious of his own authority in Rome, made vigorous protest whenever rebels fled to Charlemagne or appealed to that monarch’s arbitration, and contested the supremacy of the imperial officials in Rome. Yet the pope was no absolute sovereign, nor, in the modern sense of the term, did any then exist. He asserted supremacy over many lands which continually rebelled against him, and which, for want of an army of his own, he was unable to reduce to obedience without others’ help. Neither did the republic acknowledge him as its head. It profited by the growing power of the pope, could not exist without him, respected his moral authority, but considered that he usurped undue power in Rome. This λvas specially the feeling of the nobles, who had hitherto held the chief authority in the republic, and, being still the leaders of the army, were by no means willing to relinquish it. The Roman nobles were very different from other aristocratic bodies elsewhere. They were not, as they pretended, descendants of the Camilli aud the Scipios, but neither were they a feudal aristocracy, inasmuch as the Teutonic element had as yet made small way among them. They were a mixture of different elements, national and foreign, formed by the special conditions of Rome. Their power was chiefly derived from the high offices and large grants of money and land conferred on them by the popes; but, as no dynasty existed, they could not be dynastic. Every pope aggrandized his own kindred and friends, and these were the natural and often open adversaries of the next pontiff and his favourites. Thus the Roman nobility was powerful, divided, restless, and turbulent; it was continually plotting against the pope, threatening not only his power, but even his life; it continually appealed to the people for assistance, stirred the militia to revolt, and rendered government an impossibility. Hence, notwithstanding his immense moral authority, the pope was the effective head neither of the aristocracy, the army, nor of the as yet unorganized lower classes. The lord of vast but often insubordinate territories, the recognized master of a capital city torn by internecine feud and plots against himself, he needed the support of an effective force for his own preservation and the maintenance of the authority proffered him from all quarters. Hence the necessity of creating an empire of the West, after having snapped every link with that of the East. Thus the history of Rome is still, as in the past, a history of continual strife between pope, emperor, and republic; and the city, while imbibing strength from all three, keeps them in perpetual tumult and confusion.

Leo III. (796-816) further strengthened the ties between Charlemagne and the church by sending the former a letter with the keys of the shrine of St Peter and the banner of Rome. Charlemagne had already joined to his office of patrician the function of high justice. The new symbols now sent constituted him miles of Rome and general of the church. The pope urged him to despatch an envoy to receive the oath of fealty, thus placing himself, the representative of the republic, in the subordinate position of one of the bishops who had received the immunities of counts. And all these arrangements took place without the slightest reference to the senate, the army, or the people. Much resentment was felt, especially by the nobles, and a revolution ensued headed by the primicerius Paschalis and the secundicerius Campulus, and backed by all who wished to liberate the city from the papal rule. During a solemn procession the pope was attacked and barbarously maltreated by his assailants, who tried to tear out his eyes and tongue (799). He was thrown into prison, escaped, and overtook Charlemagne at Paderborn, and returned guarded by ten of the monarch’s envoys, who condemned to death the leaders of the revolt, reserving, however, to their sovereign the right of final judgment. Charlemagne arrived in December 800, and as Iiighjustice assembled a tribunal of the clergy, nobles, citizens, and Franks; he pronounced Leo to be innocent, and confirmed the capital sentence passed on the rebels. But through the intercession of the pope, who dreaded the wrath of the nobles, this was presently com [9:20:787]muted into perpetual exile. And finally on Christmas day, in St Peter’s, before an assemblage of Roman and Frankish lords, the clergy, and the people, the pontiff placed the imperial crown on Charlemagne’s head and all proclaimed him emperor.

Thus the new emperor was elected by the Romans and consecrated by the pope. But he was their real master and supreme judge. The pope existed only by his will, since he alone supplied the means for the maintenance of the temporal power, and already pretended to the right of controlling the papal elections. Yet Charlemagne was not sovereign of Rome; he possessed scarcely any regalia there, and was not in command of the army; he mainly represented a principle, but this principle was the law which is the basis of the state. The pope still nominated the Roman judges, but the emperor or his ro⅛' presided over them, together with those of the pope, and his decision was appealed to in last resort. During the Caro-lingian times no mention is found of the prefect, and it would seem that his office was filled by the imperial missus, or legate, the judices de clero, and judices de militia. The power of the pope was now entangled with that of the republic on the one hand and that of the empire on the other. The consequent confusion of sacred and secular functions naturally led to infinite complications and disputes.

The death of Charlemagne in 814 was the signal for a fresh conspiracy of the nobles against the pope, who, discovering their design, instantly put the ringleaders to death, and was severely blamed by Louis for this violation of the imperial prerogative. While the matter was under discussion the nobles broke out in fiercer tumults, both in Rome and the Campagna. At last, in 824, the emperor Lothair came to re-establish order in Rome, and proclaimed a new and noteworthy constitution, to which Pope Eugenius II. (824-27) gave his oath of adherence. By this the partnership of pope and emperor in the temporal rule of Rome and the states of the church was again confirmed. The more direct power appertained to the pope; the supreme authority, présidence of the tribunals, and final judgment on appeal to the emperor. The new constitution also established the right of contending parties to select either the Roman or the Teutonic code for the settlement of their disputes. During the Carolingian period it is not surprising that the commune should have been, as it were, absorbed by the church and the empire. In fact it is scarcely mentioned in history throughout that time. And when, no longer sustained by the genius of its founder, the Frankish empire began to show signs of dissolution, the popes, finding their power thereby strengthened, began to assume many of the imperial attributes. Soon, however, as a natural consequence of the loss of the main support of the papacy, the nobles regained vigour and were once more masters of the city. Teutonic and feudal elements had now largely penetrated into their organization. The system of granting lands, and even churches and convents, as benefices according to feudal forms, became more and more general. It was vain for the popes to offer opposition, and they ended by yielding to the current. The fall of the Frankish empire left all Italy a prey to anarchy, and torn by the faction fights of Berengar of Friuli and Guido of Spoleto, the rival claimants to the crowns of Italy and the empire. The Saracens were advancing from the south, the Huns from the north; the popes had lost all power; and in the midst of this frightful chaos a way was opened for the rise of the republics. Anarchy was at its climax in Rome, but the laity began to overpower the clergy to such an extent that the judices de militia prevailed over the judices de clero. For a long time no imperial missi or legates had been seen, and the papacy was incredibly lowered. The election of the popes had positively fallen into the hands of certain beautiful women notorious for their evil life and depravity. The aristocracy alone gained strength; now freed from the domination of the emperor, it continually wrested fresh privileges from the impotent pontiffs, and became organized as the ruling force of the republic. Gregorovius, notwithstanding his denial of the continuation of the senate after the 6th century, is obliged to acknowledge that it appeared to have retürned to life in the power of this new baronage. And, although this body was now permeated with the feudal principle, it did not discard its ancient traditions. The nobles claimed to be the main source of the empire; they wished to regain the dignity and office of patricius, and to make it, if possible, hereditary in their families. Nothing is known of their system of organization, but it seems that they elected a chief bearing the title of consul, senator, pmnceps Romanorum, who was officially recognized by the pope, as a patricius presided over the tribunals, and was the head of the commune.

Theophylact was one of the first to assume this dignity. His wife Theodora, known as the senαtrix, was one of the women then dominating Rome by force of their charms and licentiousness. She was supposed to be the concubine' of Pope John X. (914-928), whose election was due to her influence. Her daughter Marozia, in all things her worthy rival, was married to Alberic, a foreign mercenary of uncertain birth who rose to a position of great influence, and, although an alien, played a leading part in the affairs of the city. He helped to increase the power of Theophylact, who seemingly shared the rule of the city with the pope. In the bloody war that had to be waged against the Saracens of southern Italy, and at the defeat of the latter on the Garigliano (916), Theophylact and Alberic were the Roman leaders, and distinguished themselves by their valour. They disappeared from the scene after this victory, but Marozia retained her power, and bore a son Alberic, who was destined to greater deeds. The pope found himself caught in this woman’s toils, and struggled to escape, but Marozia, gaining fresh influence by her marriage with Hugo, margrave of Tuscany, imprisoned the pontiff himself in Castle St Angelo (928). This fortress was the property of Marozia and the basis of her strength. The unfortunate John died within its walls. Raised to the chair by Theodora, he was deposed and killed by her daughter. The authority of the latter reached its culminating point in 931, when she succeeded in placing her son John XI. on the papal throne. On the death of her second husband she espoused Hugo of Provence, the same who in 928 had seized the iron crown at Pavia, and now aspired to the empire. Dissolute, ambitious, and despotic, he came to Rome in 932, and, leaving his army outside the walls, entered Castle St Angelo with his knights, instantly began to play the tyrant, and gave a blow to Alberic his stepson, who detested him as a foreign intruder. This blow proved the cause of a memorable revolution; for Alberic rushed from the castle and harangued the people, crying that the time was come to shake off the tyrannous yoke of a woman and of barbarians who were once the slaves of Rome. Then, putting himself at the head of the populace, he closed the city gates to prevent Hugo’s troops from coming to the rescue, and attacked the castle. The king fled; Marozia was imprisoned, Alberic proclaimed lord of the Romans, and the pope confined to the Lateran in the custody of his own brother. Rome was again an independent state, a republic of nobles. Rid of the temporal dominion of emperor and pope, and having expelled the foreigners with great energy and courage, it chose Alberic for its chief with the title of pmnceps atgue omnium Romanornm senator. The tendency of the Roman republic to elect a supreme authority, first mani [9:20:788]fested in the case of Theophylact, was repeated in those of Alberic, Brancaleone, Crescenzio, Cola di Rienzo, and others. One of the many causes of this tendency may be traced to the conception of the new empire of which Rome was the original and enduring fountainhead. As Rome had once transferred the empire from Byzantium to the Franks, so Rome was surely entitled to reclaim it. The imperial authority was represented by the office of patrician, now virtually assumed by Alberic. That he gave the name of Octavian to his son is an additional proof of this fact. In the Eternal City the mediaeval political idea has always the aspect of a resurrection or transformation of classic antiquity. This is another characteristic of the history of the Roman commune.

Alberic’s strength was due to his connexion with the nobility, to his father’s valiant service against the Saracens at the battle of Garigliano, and to the militia under his command, on which everything depended amid the internal and external dangers now threatening the new state. As yet no genuine municipal constitution was possible in Rome, w τ here neither the people nor the wealthy burghers engaged in industry and commerce had any fixed organization. All was in the hands of the nobles, and Alberic, as their chief, frequently convened them in council, although obliged to use pressure to keep them united and avoid falling a prey to their disputes. Hence the whole power was concentrated in his grasp; he was at the head of the tribunals as well as of the army. The judices de clero and judices de militia still existed, but no longer met in the Lateran or the Vatican, under the presidency of emperor and pope or their missi. Alberic himself was their president; and, a still more significant fact, their sittings were often held in his private dwelling. There is no longer any mention of prefect or patricius. The papal coinage w τ as inscribed with Alberic’s name instead of the emperor’s. His chief attention was given to the militia, which was still arranged in scholae, and it is highly probable that he was the author of the new division of the city into twelve regions, with a corresponding classification of the army in as many regiments under twelve flags and twelve baηderesi, one for every region. The organization of the scholae could not have been very dissimilar, but doubtless Alberic had some important motive for altering the old method of classification. By means of the armed regions he included the people in the forces. It is certain that after his time we find the army much changed and far more democratic. It was only natural that so excellent a statesman should seek the aid of the popular element as a defence against the arrogance of the nobles, and it was requisite to reinforce the army in order to be prepared for the attacks threatened from abroad. This change effected, Alberic felt prepared for the worst, and began to rule with energy, moderation, and justice. His contemporaries award him high praise, and he seems to have been exempt from the vices of his mother and grandmother.

In 933 Hugo made his first attack upon the city, and w r as repulsed. A second attempt in 936 proved still more unfortunate, for his army was decimated by a pestilence. Thoroughly disheartened, he not only made peace, but gave his daughter in marriage to Alberic, thus satisfying the latter’s desire to ally himself with a royal house. But this union led to no conciliation with Hugo. For Alberic, finding his power increased, marched at the head of his troops to consolidate his rule in the Campagna and the Sabine land. On the death of his brother, Pope John XI., in 936, he controlled the election of several successive popes, quelled a conspiracy formed against him by the clergy and certain nobles instigated by Hugo, and brilliantly repulsed, in 941, another attack by that potentate. At last, however, this inveterate foe withdrew from Rome, being summoned to the north by the victories of his rival Berengarius. But Alberic, after procuring the election of various popes who were docile instruments of his will, experienced a check when Agapetus H. (946-955), a man of firmness and resource, was raised to the papal throne. The fortunes of Berengarius were now in the ascendant. In 950 he had seized the iron crown, and ruled in the Pentapolis and the exarchate. This being singularly painful to the pope, he proceeded to make alliance with all those enemies of Berengarius preferring a distant emperor to a neighbouring and effective sovereign, with the Roman nobles who were discontented with Alberic, and with all who foresaw danger, even to Rome, from the extended power of Berengarius. And Agapetus recurred to the old papal policy, by making appeal to Otho I., whose rule in Germany was distinguished by a prestige almost comparable with that of Charlemagne.

Otho immediately responded to the appeal and descended into Italy; but his envoys were indignantly repulsed by Alberic, and, being prudent as well as firm, he decided to wait a more opportune moment for the accomplishment of his designs. Meanwhile Alberic died in 954, and the curtain fell on the first great drama of the Roman republic. He had reigned for twenty-two years with justice, energy, and prudence; he had repelled foreign invaders, maintained order and authority. He seems, however, to have realized that the aspect of affairs was about to change, that the work he had accomplished would be exposed to new dangers. These dangers, in fact, had already begun with the accession of an enterprising pope to the Holy See. The name of Octavian given by Alberic to his son leads to the inference that he meant to make his power hereditary. But, suddenly, he began to educate this son for the priesthood, and, assembling the nobles in StBeteFs shortly before his death, he made them swear to elect Octavian as pope on the decease of Agapetus II. They kept their word, for in this way they freed themselves from a ruler. Possibly Alberic trusted that both offices might be united, and that his son would be head of the state as well as the church. But the nobles knew this to be a delusion, especially in the case of a nature such as Octavian’s. The lad w , as sixteen years old when his father died, received princely honours until the death of Agapetus, and w τ as then elected pope with the name of John XII. He had inherited the ungoverned passions of his grandmother Marozia and great-grandmother Theodora, but without their intelligence and cunning. His palace was the scene of the most scandalous licence, while his public acts were those of a baby tyrant. He conferred a bishopric on a child of ten, consecrated a deacon in a stable, invoked Venus and Jupiter in his games, and drank to the devil’s health. He desired to be both pope and prince, but utterly failed to be either. Before long, realizing the impossibility of holding in check Berengarius, who still ruled over the exarchate, he sought in 960 the aid of Otho L, and promised him the imperial crown. Thus the new ruler was summoned by the son of the man by whom he had been repulsed. Otho vowed to defend the church, to restore her territories, to refrain from usurping the power of the pope or the republic, and was crowned on the 2d February 962 with unheard-of pomp and display.

Accordingly, after being extinct for thirty-seven years, the empire was revived under different but no less difficult conditions. The politico-religious unity founded by Charlemagne had been dissolved, partly on account of the heterogeneous elements of which it was composed, and partly because other nations were in course of formation.
[9:20:789]

Now too the feudal system was converting the officers of the I empire into independent princes, and the new spirit of communal liberty was giving freedom to the cities. Otho once more united the empire and the church, Italy and Germany, in order to combat these new foes. But the difficulties of the enterprise at once came to light. John XII., finding a master in the protector he had invoked, now joined the discontented nobles who were conspiring with Berengarius against the emperor. But the latter hastened to Rome in November 963, assembled the clergy, nobles, and heads of the people, and made them take an oath never again to elect a pope without his consent and that of his son. He also convoked a synod presided over by himself in St Peter’s, which judged, condemned, and deposed Pope John and elected Leo VIIL (963-965), a Roman noble, in his stead. All this was done at the direct bidding of the emperor, who thus deprived the Romans of their most valued privilege, the right of choosing their own pope. But the people had now risen to considerable importance, and, for the first time, we find it officially represented in the synod by the plebeian Pietro, surnamed Imperiola, together with the leaders of the militia, which had also become a popular institution since Alberic’s reign. It was no longer easy to keep the lower orders in subjection, and by their junction with the malcontent nobles they formed a very respectable force. On the 3d January 964 they sounded the battle-peal and attacked the Vatican, where the emperor was lodged. The German knights repulsed them with much slaughter, and this bloodshed proved the beginning of an endless feud. Otho departed in February, and John XII., as the chosen pope of the Romans, returned with an army of followers and compelled the defenceless Leo VIII. to seek safety in flight. Soon afterwards Leo was deposed and excommunicated by a new synod, and many of his adherents were cruelly murdered. But on the 14th May 964 John suddenly expired; the Romans, amid violent struggles and tumults, resumed their rights, elected Benedict V. and procured his consecration in spite of the emperor’s veto. Otho now appeared at the head of an army, committed fresh slaughter, besieged the city, reduced it by famine, and, after holding a council which deposed Benedict and sent him a prisoner to Hamburg, restored Leo VIII. to the papal throne.

But, although the emperor thus disposed of the papacy at his will, his arbitrary exercise of power roûsed a long and obstinate resistance, which had no slight effect upon the history of the commune. Leo VIII. died in 965, and the imperial party elected John XIIL (965-972). Upon this the nobles of the national party joined the people, and there was a general revolt. The nobles were led by Pietro, prefect of Rome. As we have noted, this office seemed to be extinct during the Carolingian rule, but we again meet with it in 955, after an interval of a century and a half. The leaders of the people were twelve decarconi, a term of unknown derivation, but probably indicating chiefs of the twelve regions {dodecarchi, dodecarcoηi, decarconi). The new pope was seized and confined, first in Castle St Angelo, then in a fortress in the Campagna. But the emperor qτiιckly marched an army against Rome, and this sufficed to produce a reaction which recalled the pope (November 966), sent the prefect into exile, and put several of the rebellious nobles to death. And shortly after the emperor sacked the city. Many Romans were exiled, some tortured, others, including the twelve decarconi, killed. John XIII. died in 972 and Otho in 973.

All these events clearly prove how great a change had now taken place in the conditions of Rome. The people (plebs) had made its appearance upon the stage; the army had become democratic; the twelve regions were regularly organized under leaders. Opposed to them stood the nobles, headed by the prefect, also a noble, precisely as in Florence the nobles and the podestà were later opposed to the guilds and the people. So far, it is true, nobles and people had made common cause in Rome; but this harmony was soon to be interrupted. The feudal spirit had made its way among the Roman aristocrats, had split them into two parties and diminished their strength. It was now destined to spread, and, as it was always vigorously detested and opposed by the people elsewhere in Italy, so the same consequence was inevitable in Rome. Another notable change, and a subject of unending controversy, had also occurred in the administration of justice. So far there were the judices de clero, also known as ordinary or palatine judges, and the judices de militia, also styled consules or duces. These judges generally formed a court of seven, three being de clero, four de militia, or vice versa, under the presidency of the papal or imperial missi. In criminal cases the judices de militia had the prefect or the imperial missus for their president. But there was a third order of judges called pedanei, a COnsulibus creatk It seems clear that the duces, being distributi per judicatus, found themselves isolated in the provinces, and to obtain assistance nominated these pedanei, who were legal experts. In Rome, with its courts of law, they were less needed, but possibly in those sections of the city where cases of minor importance were submitted to a single magistrate reference was made to the pedanei. But many changes were made under the Franks, and when the edict of Lothair (824) granted free choice of either the Roman or Germanic laιv, and the duces were replaced by comites and gαstaldioηes, chiefly of German origin, the use of legal experts became increasingly necessary. And the custom of employing them was the more easily diffused by being already common among the Franks, whose scabini were legal experts acting as judges, though not qualified to pass sentence. Thus the pedanei multiplied, came to resemble the scabini, and were designated judices dαtivi (a magistratu dαti) or simply dativi. These were to be found in the exarchate in 838, but not in Rome until 961, when the judices de militia had ceased to exist. The great progress of the German legal procedure may then have contributed to the formation of the new office.

Meanwhile Pope John XIII. had been succeeded by Benedict VI. (973-974) and Otho I. by his son Otho II., a youth of eighteen married to the Byzantine princess Theophano. Thereupon the Romans, who had supported the election of another pope, and were in no awe of the new emperor, rose to arms under the command of Crescenzio, a rich and powerful noble. They not only seized Benedict VI. by force, but strangled him in Castle St Angelo. The national and imperial parties then elected several popes who were either exiled or persecuted, and one of them was said to be murdered. In 985 John XV. was elected (985-996). During this turmoil, the national party, composed of nobles and people, led by Giovanni Crescenzio, son of the other Crescenzio mentioned above, had taken complete possession of the government. This Crescenzio assumed the title of patrician, and sought to imitate Alberic, although far his inferior in capacity. Fortunately for him the reigning pope was a detested tyrant, and the emperor a child entirely guided by his mother. But the new emperor Otho III. was backed by a powerful party, and on coming to Rome in 996 was able, although only aged fifteen, to quell the rebellion, oust Crescenzio from public life, and elect as successor to John XV. his own cousin, Pope Gregory V. (996-999). But this first German pope surrounded himself with compatriots, and by raising them to lofty posts even in the tribunals excited a revolt that [9:20:790]drove him from the throne (29th September 996). Cres-cenzio, being master of Castle St Angelo, resumed the title of patrician or consul of the Romans, expelled the German judges, reconstituted the government, prepared his troops for defence, and created a new pope. But the following year Otho III. came to Rome, and his party opened the gates to him. Although deserted by nearly all his adherents, Crescenzio held the castle valiantly against its besiegers. At last, on the 29th April 998, he was forced to make terms, and the imperialists, violating their pledges, first put him to torture and then hurled him from the battlements. Gregory V. dying shortly after these events, Sylvester II., another German, was raised to the papacy (999-1003).

Thus Otho III. was enabled to establish his mastery of Rome. But, as the son of a Greek mother, trained amid Greek influences, his fantastic and contradictory nature seemed only to grasp the void. He wished to reconstitute a Romano-Byzantine empire with Rome for l∏3 capital. His discourse always turned on the ancient republic, on consuls and senate, on the might and grandeur of the Roman people; and his edicts were addressed to the senate and the people. The senate is now constantly mentioned, and its heads bear the title of consuls. The emperor also gave renewed honour to the title of patrician, surrounded himself with officials bearing Greek and Roman designations, and raised the prestige of the prefect, who, having now almost the functions of an imperial vicar, bore the eagle and the sword as his insignia. Nevertheless Otho III. was thoroughly German, and during his reign all Germanic institutions made progress in Rome. This was particularly the case with feudalism, and Sylvester II. was the first pope to treat it with favour. Many families of real feudal barons now arose. The Crescenzii held sway in the Sabine hills, and Prseneste and Tusculum were great centres cf feudalism in the llth century. The system of feudal benefices was recognized by the church, which made grants of lands, cities, and provinces in the feudal manner. The bishops, like feudal barons, became actual counts. And, in consequence of these changes, when the emperor, as head of the feudal system, seeks to impose his will upon the church (which has also become feudal) and control the papal elections, he is met by the great question of the investitures, a question destined to disturb the whole world. Meanwhile the Roman barons were growing more and more powerful, and were neither submissive nor faithful to the emperor. On the contrary they resented his attitude as master of Rome, and, when he subjected Tivoli to the Holy See, attacked both him and the pope with so much vigour as to put both to flight (l6th February 1001). Thereupon Rome again became a republic, headed by Gregory of Tusculum, a man of a powerful family claiming descent from Alberic.

By the emperor’s death in January 1002 the race of the Othos became extinct, the papacy began to decline, as at the end of the Carolingian period, and the nobles, divided into an imperial and a national party, were again predominant. They reserved to themselves the office of patrician, and, electing popes from their own ranks, obtained enlarged privileges and power. At the time when Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, profiting by the extinction of the Othos and the anarchy of Germany, was stirring Italy in the vain hope of constituting a national kingdom, the Roman republic was being consolidated under another Giovanni Crescenzio, of the national faction. He was now elected patrician; one of his kinsmen was invested with the office of prefect, and the new pope John XVIII. (1003-9) was one of his creatures. Although the power of Henry of Bavaria was then gaining ascendency in Germany, and giving strength to the imperialist nobles, Crescenzio still remained supreme ruler of the city and the Campagna. Surrounded by his judges, the senators, and his kinsman the prefect, he continued to dispense justice in his own palace until his death in 1012, after ten years’ rule. And, Pope Sergius IV. having died the same year, the counts of Tusculum compassed the election of Benedict VIIL (1012-24), one of their own kin. This pope expelled the Crescenzii, changed the prefect, and reserved the title of patrician for Henry II., whom lie consecrated emperor on the 14th February 1014. A second Alberic, bearing the title of “eminentissimus consul et dux,” was now at the head of the republic and dispensed placita in the palace of his great ancestor, from whom the counts of Tusculum were also descended.

The new emperor endeavoured to re-establish order in Rome, and strengthen his own authority together with that of the pope. But the nobles had in all things the upper hand. They were regularly organized under leaders, held meetings, asserted their right to nominate both pope and emperor, and in fact often succeeded in so doing. Even Henry II. himself was obliged to secure their votes before his coronation. The terms senate and senator now recur still more frequently in history. Nevertheless, Benedict VIIL succeeded in placing his own brother, Romano, at the head of the republic with the title of “consul, dux, and senator,” thus making him leader of the nobles, who met at his bidding, and chief of the militia and the tribunals. The prefect still retained his authority, and the emperor was by right supremejudge. But, a violent revolt breaking out, the emperor only stayed to suppress it and then went to Germany in disgust. The pope, aided by his brother, conducted the government with energy; he awed the party of Crescenzio, and waged war against the Saracens in the south. But he died in 1024, and in the same year Henry II. was succeeded by Conrad II. There was now beheld a repetition of the same strange event that had followed the death of Alberic, and with no less fatal consequences. Benedict’s brother Romano, head of the republic, and still retaining office, was, although a layman, elected pope. He took the name of John XIX. (1024-33), and in 1027 conferred the imperial crown on Conrad the Salic, who, abolishing the Lothairian edict of 824, decreed that throughout Rome and its territory justice should be henceforth administered solely by the Justinian code. Thus, notwithstanding the spread of feudalism and Germanic procedure, the Roman law triumphed through the irresistible force of the national character, which was already manifested in many other ways.

Meanwhile John XIX. was succeeded by his nephew, Benedict IX. (1033-45), a lad of twelve, who placed his own brother at the head of the republic. Thus church and state assumed the aspect of hereditary possessions in the powerful house of the counts of Tusculum. But the vices and excesses of Benedict were so monstrous that the papacy sank to the lowest depth of corruption; there followed a series of tumults and reactionary attempts, and so many conflicting elections that in 1045 three popes were struggling for the tiara in the midst of scandal and anarchy. The streets and neighbourhood of Rome swarmed with thieves and assassins; pilgrims were plundered; citizens trembled for their lives; and a hundred petty barons threatened the rival popes, who were obliged to defend themselves by force. This state of things lasted until Henry III. came to re-establish order. He appointed a synod to depose the three popes, and then, with the consent of the wearied and anarchy-stricken Romans, assuming the right of election, proposed a German, Clement II., who was consecrated at Christmas 1046. Henry III. was then crowned, and also took the title of patrician. Thus the [9:20:791]emperor was lord over church and state. This, however, stirred both people and pope against him, and led to the terrible contest of the investitures, although for the moment the Romans, being exlιausted by past calamities, seemed not only resigned but contented.

In fact, the idea of reform and independence was already germinating in the church and was soon to become tenacious and irresistible. Hildebrand was the prompter and hero of this idea. He sought to abolish the simony and concubinage of the priesthood, to give the papal elections into the hands of the higher ecclesiastics, and to emancipate the church from all dependence on the empire. Henry III. procured the election of four German popes in succession, and Hildebrand was always at hand to inspire their actions and dominate them by his strength of intellect and still greater strength of will. But the fourth German pope, Victor IL, died in 1057, and Henry III. had been succeeded in 1056 by the young Henry IV. under the regency of a weak woman, the empress Agnes. Hildebrand seized this favourable moment for trying his strength and procured the election of Stephen IX. (1057-58), a candidate he had long had in view. Stephen, however, died in 1058; the nobles instantly rose in rebellion; and Gregory of Tusculum, who had assumed the patriciate, caused an incapable cousin to be named pope (Benedict X.). Upon this Hildebrand postponed his design of maintaining the papacy by the help of Italian potentates and had recourse to the empress. In a synod held at Siena with her consent Benedict was deposed and Nicholas

II. (1059-61) elected in his stead. This pope entered Rome escorted by the troops of Godfrey of Tuscany, and, when also assured of help from Naples, assembled a council of one hundred and thirteen bishops (1059), who condemned the deposed pontiff and renewed the prohibition of simony and concubinage among the priesthood. Finally Nicholas instituted the college of cardinals, entrusting it with the election of the pope, who was in future to be chosen from its ranks. The assent of the clergy and people was left purely formal. The decree also contained the proviso— “saving the honour and reverence due to the emperor”; but this too was an empty expression.

The new decree was a master-stroke of Hildebrand’s genius, for by means of it he placed the papal election in the hands of a genuine ecclesiastical senate and gave a monarchical form to the church. Backed by the Normans who were in Rome, and whose commander, Richard of Capua, did not scruple to strike off the heads of many recalcitrant nobles, Hildebrand and the pope could now pursue their work of reform. Nevertheless the nobles again revolted on the death of Nicholas II. in 1061, and declared their purpose of restoring to Henry IV. the patriciate and right of election; but Hildebrand, by speedily convoking the cardinals, procured the election of Alexander

II. (1061-73). This pope, although friendly to the empire, did not await the imperial sanction, but, protected by the Romans, at once entered the Lateran and put some other riotous nobles to death. The German bishops, however, elected Honorius IL, who had the support of the barons. Thus the city was split into two camps and a deadly civil war ensued, terminating, despite the vigorous resistance of the nobility, in the defeat of Honorius II. But the nobles persevered in the contest and were the real masters of Rome. By conferring the patriciate on the emperor, as their feudal chief, they hoped to organize themselves under the prefect, who now, with greatly increased authority, presided over both the civil and criminal courts in the absence of the pope’s representative. In a general assembly the Romans elected their prefect, whose investiture was granted by the emperor, while the pope elected another. Thus disorder was brought to a climax,

Alexander died on the 21st April 1073, and thereupon ∣ Hildebrand was at last raised to the chair as pope Gregory VIL (1073-85). He reconfirmed his predecessors’ decrees, dismissed all simoniacal and non-celibate priests, and then in a second council (1075) forbade the clergy to receive investiture at the hands of laymen. No bishop nor abbot was again to accept ring or crozier from king or emperor. Now, as ecclesiastical dignities included the possession of extensive benefices, privileges, and feudal rights, this decree gave rise to tremendous dispute and to fierce contest between the empire and the church. The nobles took a very decided part in the struggle. With Cenci, their former prefect, at their head, they rose in revolt, assailed the pope on Christmas day 1075, and threw him into prison. But their fear of the popular wrath compelled his speedy release; and he then decreed the excommunication and deposition of the emperor who had declared him deposed. That monarch afterwards made submission to Gregory at Canossa (1077), but, again turning against him, was again excommunicated. And in 1081 he returned to Italy bringing the antipope Clement III., and besieged Rome for forty days. Assembling the nobles in his camp, he there arranged a new government of the city with prefect and senate, palatine judges, and other magistrates, exactly similar to the existing government within the walls. He then took his departure, returned several times in vain, but at last forced his way into the city (March 1084), and compelled Gregory VII. to seek refuge in Castle St Angelo. The emperor was then master of Rome, established the government he had previously arranged, and, calling a parliament of nobles and bishops, procured the deposition of Gregory and the consecration of Clement III., by whom he was crowned in 1084. He then attacked and seized the Capitol, and assaulted the castle in order to capture the pope. But Robert Guiscard brought his army to the rescue. Emperor and anti-pope fled; the city was taken, the pope liberated, and Rome reduced to ruin by fire and pillage. Upon this Gregory VII., broken with grief, went away with the Normans, and died at Salerno on the 25th May 1085. He had separated the church from the people and the empire by a struggle that, as Gregorovius says, disturbed the deep sleep of the Middle Ages

Pope Paschal II. (1099-1118) found himself entirely at the mercy of the tyrannous nobles who were alike masters of Rome, of its government, and its spiritual lord. As they were divided among themselves, all the pope could do was to side with one party in order to overcome the other. With the help of his own nephew Gualfredo, the prefect Pietro Pierleone, and the Frangipani, he Avas able to keep down the Corsi, and hold the Colonna in check. Beingcompelled to repair to Benevento in 1108, he left Gualfredo to command the militia, Tolomeo of Tusculum to guard the Campagna, and the consuls Pierleone and Leone Frangipani, together Avith the prefect, in charge of the government. The consulship was no longer a mere title of honour. The consuls seem to have been elected, as at Ravenna, in imitation of those of the Lombard cities, and were at the head of the nobles and senate. The expressions “praefectus et consules,” “de senatoribus et consulibus,” are now of frequent occurrence. We have no precise knowledge of the political organization of the city at this moment; but it was an aristocratic government, similar to that originally formed in Florence, as Villani tells us, Avith a senate and consuls. The nobles were so completely the masters that the pope, in spite of having trusted them Avitlι the government, could only return to Rome Avith the aid of the Normans. Being iioav absorbed in the great investiture question, he had recourse to a daring plan. He proposed to Henry V. that the bishops [9:20:792]should resign all property derived from the crown and depend solely on tithes and donations, while the empire should resign the right of investiture. Henry seemed disposed to accept the suggestion, but, suddenly changing hjs mind, took the pope prisoner and forced him to yield the right of investiture and to give him the crown (1111). But the following year the party of reform annulled in council this concession, which the pope declared to have been extorted by force. By the death of Countess Matilda in 1115 and the bequest of her vast possessions to the Holy See, the pope’s dominions were greatly enlarged, but his authority as a ruler was nowise increased. Deeds of violence still continued in Rome; and then followed the death of the prefect Pietro. The nobles of the imperial party, joined with the people, wished to elect Pietro’s son, also nephew to Tolomeo of Tusculum, who then held the position of a potent imperial margrave, had territories stretching from the Sabine mountains to the sea, was the dictator of Tusculum, master of Latium, and consul of the Romans. The pope opposed this election to the best of his strength; but the nobles carried the day, and their new prefect received investiture from the emperor. Upon this the pope again quitted Rome, and on his return, two years later, was compelled to shut himself up in Castle St Angelo, where he died in 1118.

The popes were now the sport of the nobles whom they had aggrandized by continual concessions for the sake of peace. And peace seemed at hand when Innocent II. (1130-43), after triumphing over two antipopes, came to terms with Roger L, recognized him as king of Sicily, and gained his friendship and protection. But now still graver tumults took place. In consequence of the division of the nobles neither party could overcome its foes without the aid of the people, which thus became increasingly powerful. Throughout Upper and Central Italy the cities were being organized as free and independent communes on a democratic basis. Their example was soon followed in the ancient duchy of Rome and almost in the immediate neighbourhood of the city. Even Tivoli was converted into a republic. This excited the deepest jealousy in the Romans, and they became furious when this little city, profiting by its strong position in the Teverone valley, not only sought to annex Roman territory, but dared to offer successful resistance to the descendants of the conquerors of the world. In 1141 Tivoli openly rebelled against the mother city, and the pope sent the Romans to subdue it. They were not only repulsed, but Ignominiously pursued to their own gates. Afterwards, returning to the assault in greater numbers, they conquered the hostile town. Its defenders surrendered to the pope, and he immediately concluded a treaty of peace without consulting either the people or the republic. The soldiery, still flushed with victory, were furious at this slight. They demanded not only the submission of Tivoli to the Roman people, but also permission to demolish its walls and dwellings and expel its population. Innocent II. refused consent to these excesses, and a memorable revolution ensued by which the temporal power of the papacy was entirely overthrown.

In 1143 the rebellious people rushed to the Capitol, proclaimed the republic, reconstituted the senate, to the almost entire exclusion of the nobles, declared the abolition of the temporal power, issued coin inscribed to the senate, the people, and St Peter, and began to reckon time from the day of the restoration of liberty. Arnold of Brescia was not, as has been incorrectly stated, the author of this revolution, for he had not yet arrived in Rome. It was the outcome of an historic necessity—above all of the renewed vigour of the people and its detestation of the feudal aristocracy. This body, besides being divided into an imperial and a national party, had almost excluded from the government the powerful baronage of the Campagna and the provinces. Also, as we have before noted, the Roman aristocracy was by no means an exclusive caste. Between the great aristocrats and the people there stood a middle or new nobility, which made common cause with the people, whose chief strength now lay in the army. This, divided into twelve and then into thirteen or fourteen regions, assembled under its banners all arm-bearing citizens. Thus the exercitus was also the real populus Romanus, now bent on the destruction of the temporal power. This purpose, originating in the struggle of the investitures, was the logical and inevitable result of the proposals of Paschal IL, which, despite their rejection, found a loud echo in Italy. Lucius II. (1144-45) tried to withstand the revolution by seeking Norman aid and throwing himself into the arms of the feudal party, but this only precipitated the course of events. The people, after having excluded nearly all aristocrats from the senate, now placed at its head the noble Giordano dei Pierleoni, who had joined the revolutionary party. They named him patrician, but without prejudice to the authority of the empire, still held by them in respect, and also conferred on him the judicial powers appertaining to the aristocratic and imperial office of prefect. The pope was requested to resign the temporal power, the regalia, and every other possession, and content himself with the tithes and offerings of the faithful according to the scheme of Paschal

II. He indignantly refused, marched at the head of the nobles against the Capitol, but was violently repulsed, and received a blow on the head from a stone, which is supposed to have occasioned his speedy death on the l5th February 1145. Eugenius III. was then elected (1145-53), but soon had to fly to Viterbo in quest of armed assistance, in consequence of the senate’s resolve to forcibly prevent his consecration until he recognized the new state of things in the Eternal City.

It was at this moment that Arnold of Brescia arrived in Rome. His ideas, already well known in Italy, had inspired and promoted the Roman revolution, and he now came to determine its method and direction. Born at Brescia in the beginning of the l2th century, Arnold had studied in France under the celebrated Abelard, who had instructed him in theology and philosophy, inspired him with a great love for antiquity, and stimulated his natural independence of mind. On returning to his native land he assumed the monkish habit, and proved the force and fervour of his character by taking part in all struggles for liberty. And, together with political reform, he preached his favourite doctrine of the necessary renunciation by the clergy of all temporal wealth. Expounded with singular eloquence, these doctrines had a stirring effect on men’s minds, spread throughout the cities of northern Italy, and were echoed on all sides. It seems undoubted that they penetrated to Rome and helped to promote the revolution, so that Arnold was already present in spirit before he arrived there in person. It is known that at the Lateran council of 1139 Innocent II. had declared these doctrines to be inimical to the church and enjoined silence on their author. And, as at that time the party hostile to liberty was triumphant in Brescia, Arnold left his native place, crossed the Alps, and returned to France, where other struggles awaited him. He professed no anti-Catholic dogmas,—only maintaining that when the pope and the prelacy deviated from the gospel rule of poverty they should not be obeyed, but fearlessly opposed. In France, finding his master, Abelard, exposed to the persecutions of St Bernard, he assumed his defence with so much ardour that St Bernard directed the thunders of his eloquence against the disciple as well as the master, saying of the former, “He neither eats nor drinks,
[9:20:793]

suffers hunger, and, being leagued with the devil, only thirsts for the blood of souls.” In 1142 we find Arnold a wanderer in Switzerland, and then, suddenly reappearing in Italy, he arrived in Rome.

Three different elements entered into his nature and inspired his eloquence—an exalted and mystic temperament, a great and candid admiration for classic antiquity added to an equal admiration for republican freedom independent of the church and the empire, and a profound conviction, derived from the Vaudois and Paterine doctrines, that the church could only be purified by the renunciation of temporal wealth. Finding Rome already revolutionized in accordance with his own ideas, he immediately began to preach there. His mystic exhortations against the riches of the church had an inflammatory effect, while his classical reminiscences aroused the enthusiasm of the Romans, and his suggestion that they should imitate the republican institutions of Upper Italy met the necessities of the time that had created the revolution. He urged the reconstitution of the ancient senate and senatorial order, which indeed was already partially accomplished, and of the ancient equestrian order, and the reconstruction and fortification of the Capitol. His proposed senate was a body somewhat resembling the communal councils of Upper Italy, his equestrian order a mounted force composed of the lesser nobility, since at Rome, as elsewhere, the lower classes had neither time nor means to form part of it. All his suggestions were accepted; the citizens laboured strenuously on the fortification of the Capitol. The pope soon beheld the revolution spread beyond the walls, and several cities of the state proclaimed their independence. The barons of the Cam-pagna profited by the opportunity to act as independent sovereigns. Thus the whole domain of the church was threatened with dissolution. The pope marched towards Rome with his newly gathered army, but hoped to come to terms. The Romans in fact recognized his authority, and he in his turn recognized the republic. The office of patrician was abolished, and seems to have been replaced by that of gonfalonier, and the prefect, answering to the podestà of the other republics, was revived. The senators received investiture from the pope, who returned to Rome at Christmas 1145.

The republic now seems to have been fully constituted. The senate was drawn from the lower classes and the petty nobility, and this was the special characteristic of the new revolution. In 1144 there were fifty-six senators, probably four to each of the fourteen regions, but the number often varied. By the few existing documents of the period we notice that the senators were divided into Senatores COnsiliarii and ordinary senators. The former constituted a smaller council, which, like the Credtnza or lesser council found in other cities, consulted with the head or heads of the republic on the more urgent and secret affairs of the state. And, conjointly with the rest of the senators, it formed the greater council. Thus classic traditions were identified with new republican usages, and the commonwealth of Rome resembled those in other parts of Italy. But, of course, every republic had special local customs of its own. So the Roman senate had judicial as well as political attributes, and there was a curia senatus composed of senators and legal experts.

As was easily to be foreseen, the agreement with the pope was of short duration. The revolution could not be checked; the Romans desired independence, and their spiritual lord fled to France, whence, in 1147, he proclaimed a new crusade, while the Romans were employed in demolishing Tivoli, banishing its inhabitants, and waging war on other cities. Giordano Pierleone was gonfalonier and head of the republic, and Arnold, supported by the popular favour and the enthusiasm of the lower clergy, was preaching with even greater fervour than before. But the pope now re-entered Italy, proclaimed Arnold a schismatic, and then advancing to Tusculum assembled an army in order to attack Rome. In this emergency the Romans applied to Conrad III., the first emperor of the house of Hohenstaufen; and their urgent letters are clearly expressive of Arnold’s theories and his medley of ancient and modern, sacred and profane, ideas. “Rome,” so they said, “is the fountain of the empire confided to you by the Almighty, and we seek to restore to Rome the power possessed by her under Constantine and Justinian. For this end we conquered and destroyed the strongholds of the barons who, together with the pope and the Normans, sought to resist us. These are now attacking us on all sides. Haste to Rome, the capital of the world, thus to establish thy imperial sway over the Italian and German lands.”

After long hesitation the king of the Romans at last replied to these appeals, stating that he would come “to re-establish order, reward the faithful, and punish the rebellious.” These words promised ill. In fact Conrad had already arranged terms with the pope; but his life came to an end on the 15th February 1152.

He was succeeded by Frederick I. surnamed Barbarossa, who took no notice of the numerous letters urging him to come and receive the empire from the Roman people, which alone had the right of conferring it. In accordance with his design of subduing all the independent cities, he made an agreement with the pope, in which he vowed to give no truce to the Romans, but subject them to their spiritual lord, whose temporal power should be restored. The pope, on his side, promised to crown him emperor. Thereupon the people again rose to arms, and Arnold broke off all negotiations with Eugenius III. The senate was reorganized, formed of one hundred members, and, according to the old Roman precedent, had two consuls, one for internal and the other for external affairs. Frederick was a daring statesman, a valiant soldier in command of a powerful army, and was no friend of half measures. Accordingly the nobles ventured on reaction. Finally, to increase the gravity of the situation, an English pope, Hadrian IV., was elected (1154—59), who was also a man of strong and resolute temper. In fact, even before being able to take possession of the Lateran, he requested the Romans to banish Arnold, who, with greater eloquence than ever, was directing his thunders against the papacy. These utterances increased the wrath of Hadrian, who, encouraged by the knowledge that Frederick and his host were already in Italy, at last launched an interdict against Rome. It was the first time that a pope had ventured to curse the Eternal City. The interdict put a summary stop to the religious life of the inhabitants. Men’s minds were seized with a sudden terror, and a fierce tumult broke out. Thereupon the senators, whose opposition to the pope was less courageous than that of the fallen magnates, prostrated themselves at his feet and implored pardon. But Hadrian demanded the expulsion of Arnold before consenting to raise the interdict. Arnold was therefore obliged to leave Rome. After having for nine years preached successfully in favour of liberty, after having been the moving spirit of the new revolution, the new constitution, he was now abandoned by all, and forced to wander from castle to castle, in the hope of reaching some independent city capable of shielding him from the fierce enmity of the pope. Meanwhile Frederick I. had achieved his first victories in Lombardy, and, leaving ruined cities and bloodshed in his track, was rapidly advancing towards central Italy. The pope sent three cardinals to him, with a request for the capture and consignment of Arnold, who [9:20:794]had taken refuge in the castle of the Visconti of Campag-natico. Frederick without delay caused one of the Visconti to be seized and kept prisoner until Arnold was given up, and then consigned the latter to the papal legates. The pope in his turn gave the reformer into the hands of the prefect, Pietro di Vico, who immediately hanged his prisoner, burnt his body at the stake, and cast his ashes into the Tiber. Theexecutiontookplacein June 1155. The exact date and place of it are unknown; we only know that Arnold met his fate with great serenity and firmness.

But the Romans who had so basely deserted their champion λvould not give up their republic. Their envoys went to meet Frederick near Sutri, and made an address in the usual fantastic style on the privileges of the Roman people and its sole right to confer the imperial crown. But Frederick indignantly cut short their harangue, and they had to depart full of rage. He then continued his march, and, entering Romeon the 18th June 1155, was forthwith crowned in St Peter’s by the pope. Thereupon the Romans rushed to arms, and made a furious attack on the Leonine city and the imperial camp. A desperate battle went on throughout the day; and the knights proved that the equestrian order instituted at Arnold’s suggestion was no empty sham. About a thousand Romans perished by the sword or by drowning, but their fellow-citizens made such determined preparations to continue the struggle that Frederick, on the 19th June, hastily retreated or rather fled, and was escorted as far as Tivoli by the pope and the cardinals. After all, the temporal power of the papacy was not restored, and the republic still survived in the form bestowed on it by Arnold of Brescia. Its existence was in truth favourable rather than injurious to Frederick, whose aim was to rule over Rome and treat the bishops as his vassals. He had not yet discerned that his best policy would have been to use the republic as a lever against the pope. The latter, with keener acumen, while remaining faithful to the feudal party in Rome, made alliance with the communes of Lombardy and encouraged them in their resistance to the emperor. Hadrian IV. died in 1159, and the national party elected Alexander III. (1159-1181), who energetically opposed the pretensions of Frederick, but, having to struggle with three antipopes successively raised against him by the imperial party, was repeatedly driven into exile. During these schisms the senate quietly carried on the government, administered justice, and made war on some neighbouring cities and barons. An army comprising many nobles of the national party marched against Tusculum, but found it defended by several valiant officers and a strong band of German soldiery, who, on the 29th May 1167, inflicted on the Romans so severe a defeat that it is styled by Gregorovius the Cannae of the Middle Ages. Shortly afterwards the emperor arrived in Rome with his antipope Paschal III., and Alexander had to fly before him to Benevento. Then, at last, Frederick came to terms with the republic, recognized the senate, which accepted investiture at his hands, re-established the prefecture as an imperial office, and bestowed it on Giovanni, son of Pietro di Vico. He then hastily departed, without having advanced outside the Leonine city.

Meanwhile Pope Alexander continued the crafty policy of Hadrian and with better success, for the Lombard cities had now formed a league and inflicted a signal defeat on the emperor at Legnano on the 29th May 1176. One of the results of this battle was the conclusion of an agreement between the pope and the emperor, the latter resigning his pretensions on Rome and yielding all that he had denied to Hadrian. And by the treaty of Venice (1st August 1177) the antipope was forsaken, Alexander

III. recognized and hailed as tho legitimate pontiff, and the prefect of Rome again nominated by the pope, to whom the emperor restored the temporal power, acknowledging him the independent sovereign of Rome and of the ecclesiastical state, from Acquapendente to Ceprano. Frederick’s troops accompanied the pope to Rome, where the republic was forced to make submission to him. But, proudly conscious as it still was of its strength, its surrender wore the aspect of a voluntary concession, and its terms began with these words—“Totius populi Romani consilio et deliberatione statutum est,” <Vc. The senators, elected yearly in September, had to swear fealty to the pope, and a certain proportion of nobles was included in their number. On his return to Rome, Alexander received a solemn welcome from all, but he had neither extinguished nor really subdued the republic. On the contrary, men’s minds were more and more inflamed by the example of freedom displayed in the north of Italy. He died on the 30th August 1181. The fact that between 1181 and 1187 there were three popes always living in exile proves that the republic was by no means crushed. During the same period another blow was inflicted on the papacy by the marriage of Henry VI., soil and successor to Frederick L, with Constance, sole heiress of the Norman line in Naples. For thus the kingdom was joined to the empire and the popes were more than ever in the latter’s power. On the 20th December 1187 Clement III. (1187-91), being raised to the pontificate, made a solemn agreement with the Government of the Capitol before coming to Rome. And this peace or Concordia had the air of a treaty between potentates of equal importance. Rome confronted the pope from the same standpoint from which the Lombard cities had confronted the emperor after Legnano. This treaty, the basis of the new constitution, was confirmed on the last day of May 1188 (Anno XLIV. of the senate). It begins with these words: —“Concordia inter Dominum Papam Clementem III. et senatores populumque Romanum super regalibus et aliis dignitatibus urbis.” The pope was recognized as supreme lord, and invested the senators with their dignity. He resumed the privilege of coinage, but allowed one-third of the issue to be made by the senate. Almost all the old pontifical rights and prerogatives .were restored to him. The pope might employ the Roman militia for the defence of his patrimony, but was to furnish its pay. The rights of the church over Tivoli and Tusculum were confirmed; but the republic reserved to itself the right of making war on those cities, and declared its resolve to dismantle and destroy the walls and castle of Tusculum. In this undertaking the pope was to co-operate with the Romans, even should the unhappy city make surrender to him alone.

From all this it is clear that the church had been made independent of the empire, and that the republic, despite its numerous concessions, was by no means subject to the church. The pope, in fact, had obtained liberty of election, and Frederick L, by resigning the investiture of the prefect, had virtually renounced his claim to imperial power in Rome. The republic had no patrician nor any other imperial magistrate, and preserved its independence even as regarded the pope, who merely granted investiture to magistrates freely chosen by the people, and had no legislative nor administrative power in the city. His temporal dominion was limited to his great possessions, to his regalia, to a supreme authority that was very indefinite, and to a feudal authority over the barons of the Campagna and many cities of a state that seemed ever on the point of dissolution. The senate continued to frame laws, to govern, and to administer justice. The army carried on the wars of the republic, as we see by the tragic fate of Tusculum, which was razed to the ground on the 19th [9:20:795]April 1191. Thus the powerful counts of Tusculum disappeared; they sought refuge in the Campagna, and according to all probability the no less potent family of the Colonna sprang from their line. In consequence of these events, the nobles realized that the papacy sought to reduce them to vassalage. And, seeing that the republic remained firmly established and able to help them, they began to adhere to it and succeeded in obtaining admission to the new senate. In fact, whereas since 1143 plebeians and petty nobles had prevailed in its ranks, nobles of ancient descent are now found outnumbering the knights and burghers. But in 1191 this state of things caused a sudden popular outbreak which abolished the aristocratic senate and gave the headship of the republic to a single senator, summus senator, named Benedetto “Carissimus” or “Carus Homo” or “Carosomo,” of unknown, but undoubtedly plebeian, origin. During the two years he remained in office this personage stripped the pope of his revenues, despatched justitiarii even to the provinces, and with the aid of the parliament and other popular assemblies promulgated laws and statutes. But he was overthrown by a counter-revolution, and Giovanni Capoccio of the party of the nobles became senator for two years, and had been succeeded by one of the Pierleoni when, in 1197, a fresh revolution re-established a senate of fifty-six members, chiefly consisting of feudal barons in high favour with Henry VI., who had revived the imperial faction in Rome. But this emperor’s life ended the same year as the pope’s, in 1198, and the new pontiff Innocent III. (1198-1216) began to make war on the nobles, who were again masters of the republic. Their leader was the prefect Pietro di Vico. Owing to the revolution of 1143 most of the prefectorial attributes were now vested in the senate; nevertheless Pietro still retained a tribunal of police both within and without the city. But his main strength λvas derived from the vast possessions of the Vico family, in which the office of prefect now became hereditary. Very soon, however, these prefects of Vico were chiefly regarded as the great feudal lords of Tuscia, and the independent municipal office lost its true character. Then the popes made a point of according great pomp and dignity to this nominal prefect, in order to overshadow the senator, who still represented the independence of the republic and had assumed many of the attributes wrested from the prefect.

But Innocent III., dissatisfied with this state of things, contrived by bribing the people to arrogate to himself the right of electing the senator, who had now to swear fealty and submission to the pope, and also that of nominating the provincial justitiarii, formerly chosen by the Government of the Capitol. This was a deadly blow to the republic, for the principal rights of the people, i.e., the election of pope and emperor, prefect and senate, were now lost. The general discontent provoked fresh revolutions, and Innocent III. employed all his political dexterity to ward off their effects. But shortly afterwards the people made a loud outcry for a senate of fifty-six members; and the pope, again making a virtue of necessity, caused that number to be chosen by twelve mediani specially named by him for the purpose. Even this did not calm the popular discontent, which was also stirred by other disputes. The consequence was that when, six months later, the pope again elected a single senator the Romans rose to arms, and in 1204 formed a Government of Buoni Uomini in opposition to that created by the pope. But an amicable arrangement being concluded, the pope once more nominated fifty-six senators; and when, soon after, he again reduced them to one, the people were too weary to resist (1205). Thus the Capitol was subdued, and Innocent

III. spent his last years in tranquillity.

On the 22d November 1220 Honorius III. (1216-27) conferred the imperial crown on Frederick IL, who confirmed to the church the possession of her former states, of those bequeathed to her by countess Matilda, and even of the March of Ancona. But it was soon seen that he sought to dominate all Italy, and was therefore a foe to be dreaded. The successor of Honorius, Pope Gregory IX. (1227-41) was speedily insulted and put to flight by the Ghibelline nobles, whose courage had revived, and the republic began to subdue the Latian cities on its own account. Peace was several times made and unmade by pope and people; but no enduring harmony was possible between them, since the former wished to subject the entire state to the church, and the latter to escape from the rule of the church and hold sway over “the universal land from Ceprano to Radicofani” formerly, belonging to the duchy. Accordingly the Roman people now appointed judges, imposed taxes, issued coin, and made the clergy amenable to secular tribunals. In 1234 the senator Luca Savelli published an edict declaring Tuscia and Campania territories of the republic, and sentjudges thither to exact an oath of obedience. He also despatched the militia to the coast, where it occupied several cities and erected fortresses; and columns λvere raised everywhere inscribed with the initials S. P. Q. R. The pope, unable to prevent but equally unable to tolerate these acts, fled from Rome, hurling his anathema against Savelli, “et omnes illos con-siliarios urbis quorum consilio,” Ac. The Romans sacked the Lateran and the houses of many cardinals, and marched on Viterbo, but were driven back by the papal troops. When Savelli left office and Angelo Malabranca was elected in his stead, the people made peace and submission in 1235, and were obliged to give up their pretensions of subjecting the clergy to ordinary tribunals and the urban territory to the republic. Thus matters were virtually settled on the footing established by Innocent

III., thanks to the aid given to the pope by Frederick II., who had been one of the promoters of the rebellion.

It may appear strange that, at this period of their history, the Romans, after showing such tenacious adherence to the republic and senate, should have accepted the rule of a single senator without rushing to arms, and passed and repassed from one form of government to another with such surprising indifference. But on closer examination it is plain that these changes were greater in appearance than reality. We have already seen, in treating of Carosomo, how the single senator convoked the people in parliament to pass sanction on the laws. But, whenever there is only one senator, we also continually meet with the expression “consilium vel consilia urbis.” It is evident that when, instead of laws to be approved in parliament by a simple placet or rejected by a non-placet, matters requiring consideration had to be discussed, the senator convoked a much smaller council, consisting only of the leaders of the people. These leaders were the heads of the twelve or thirteen regions, of the guilds, now becoming organized and soon to be also thirteen in number, and of the militia. As in the other Italian republics, all these associations had been formed in Rome.

The senator therefore held consultation with the leading men of the city; and, although, especially at first, these meetings were rather loosely organized, it is clear that they took the form of two councils—one numerous (fion-siglio maggiore), the other limited (consigliο minore or spéciale), co-operating with and forming part of the first. Such was the prevailing custom throughout Italy at the time when Roman institutions most nearly resembled those of the other republics. We already know that, from the date of Arnold’s reforms, the senate, with its junta of counsellors, had been divided into two parts, forming when [9:20:796]united a species of greater council. Therefore the transition from a senate divided into two parts to the greater and lesser councils must have been very easy and natural. And, seeing that later, when the nomination of a single senator had become a constant practice, the meetings of the two councils are frequently mentioned without the slightest remark or hint as to their origin, it is clear that they had been gradually formed and long established. Not long after the revolution of 1143 the grandees sought to re-enter the senate; and the popes themselves, partly from dread of the people and partly to aggrandize their own kindred, contributed to build up the power of a new and no less turbulent nobility. This class, arising between the 12th and 13th centuries, was composed of families newly created by the popes, together with remnants of the oldaristocracy, such as the Frangipani, Colonna, <fec. These nobles, regaining possession of the senate, so completely eliminated the popular element that, when the popes again opposed them, and, obtaining from the parliament the right of electing the senators, adopted the expedient of appointing one only, the senator was always chosen from the ranks of the nobles. And then the people, unable and unwilling to renounce republican forms, replaced their suppressed senate by a greater and a lesser council. This was an easy task—a natural consequence of the fact that the people now began to constitute the real strength of the republic. Later, with an increasing detestation for their nobility, the Romans decreed that the single senator should be of foreign birth, and, as we shall see, chose Brancaleone in the middle of the 13th century.

Thus, after a long series of frequent changes and revolutions, the Roman republic became a commonwealth, with an increasing resemblance to those of the other Italian cities. The people were organized and armed, the guilds almost established, the two councils gradually constituted, and the aristocracy, while retaining special local characteristics, assumed its definitive shape. It is not surprising to find that Rome, like other Italian cities, now possessed statutes of its own. There has been much controversy on this point. Certain writers had alluded to a statute of 1246. As no one, however, could discover any statute of that date, others decided that it had never existed. A statute of 1363 was TecentlypublishedbyProfessor Camillo Re, who asserted it to be the first and most ancient that Rome had possessed. But the still more recent researches of Messrs La Mantia and Levi prove that Professor Re’s assertions were somewhat too bold. There is certain evidence of a statutum senatus existing between 1212 and 1227, of a statutum vel Capitulare Senatoris vel senatus of 1235, followed in 1241 by a statutum urbis. This brings us very near to the statute of 1246 mentioned by Vitale and others. So it is well ascertained that, in the first half of the l3th century, Rome possessed statutes at large composed of older limited statutes. The consuls of the trade guilds were from 1267 regular members of the councils; and the merchants’ guild held general meetings in 1255. Its statutes were confirmed in 1296 by the senator Pandolfo Savelli, and the compilation of these, published in 1880 by Signor Gatti, refers to 1317.

Meanwhile the struggle between Frederick IT. and the pope was once more renewed. The former sought to dominate Italy, separate the state from the church, and repress the republics. The latter, although really hostile to the Roman free Government, joined it against the emperor, who on his side favoured the republic of Rome and the nobles most adverse to the pope. Thus the new nobility, composed, as we have seen, of two different elements, was again split into a Guelf party headed by the Orsini and a Ghibelline party under the Colonna. And in 1238 it was deemed advisable to elect two senators instead of one, in the hope of conciliating both factions by simultaneously raising them to power. Afterwards one only was elected, alternately an Orsini and a Colonna, then again two, and so on. But all these changes failed in their aims, since the struggle between emperor and pope exasperated party feeling in Rome. The political genius of Frederick might have wrought great harm to the city had not his mind teemed with contradictory ideas. Although desirous to emancipate the state from the church, he was opposed to the communal democracy, which was then the chief strength of the secular state in Italy. AVhile combating the church and persecuting her defenders, he yet sent heretics to the stake; although excommunicated, he undertook a crusade; he feasted at his table philosophers, sceptic and atheist poets, bishops, and Alussulmans; he proclaimed anti-Christian the possession of wealth by the church, yet made lavish gifts to altar and monastery. Thus, although he had a strong party in Rome, it seemed to dissolve at his approach, inasmuch as all feared that he might abolish the statutes and liberties of the commune. It fact, when he advanced towards Rome on the death of Gregory IX. in 1241 he was energetically repulsed by the people, and later even by Viterbo, a city that had always been faithful to him. But after he had withdrawn his adherents gained strength and put to flight his opponent, Innocent

IV. (1243-54), the newly elected pope, who then from his asylum in France hurled an excommunication against him. Frederick’s death in December 1250 determined the fall of the Ghibelline party and the close of the imperial epoch in Italy. The pope instantly returned to Rome with the set purpose of destroying the power of the Hohenstaufens. This was no longer difficult when, by the decease of Conrad IV. (1254), the child Conradin became the last legitimate representative of that line, and negotiations were already on foot for placing the Angevins on the Neapolitan throne.

The republic meanwhile preserved its independence against the pope, who, among other concessions, had entirely given up to it the right of coinage. Nevertheless, being much harassed by the factiousness of the nobility, it was obliged in 1252 to decide on the election of an alien senator armed with ample powers, precisely as other communes gave the government into the hands of a podestà. Accordingly a Bolognese noble, Brancaleone degli Andal5, count of Casalecchio, and a Ghibelline of much i energy and talent, was invited to Rome. But before J accepting office he insisted on making definite terms. He∣ desired to hold the government for three years; and this, 1 although contrary to the statutes, was granted. Further, to i ensure his personal safety, he demanded that many scions of the noblest Roman houses should be sent as hostages to Bologna; and to this also the republic consented. Then, in August 1252, he came with his judges and notaries, made oath to observe justice and the laws, and began to govern. He was head of the republic in peace and in war, supreme judge and captain in chief. He nominated the podestàs of subject territories, despatched ambassadors, issued coin, concluded treaties, and received oaths of obedience. The pope, who was then at Perugia, was greatly afflicted by the arrival of this new master, but, despairing of aid from any quarter, was forced to make a virtue of necessity. Thus Brancaleone was able to seize the reins of power with a firm grasp. The parliament still met in the square of the Capitol, and the greater and lesser councils in the church of Ara Coeli. There were besides frequent assemblies of the college of Capitoline judges or assectamentum. Unfortunately, no records having been preserved of the proceedings of the Roman councils and parliament, little can be said of the manner in which affairs were conducted. Certainly Brancaleone’s govern[9:20:797]ment was not very parliamentary. He convoked the councils as seldom as was possible, although he frequently assembled the people in parliament. The chief complaint made against him was of undue severity in the administration of justice. He rendered the clergy amenable to secular tribunals, subdued the neighbouring cities of Tivoli, Palestrina, <fec., and commanded in person the attacking force. But his greatest energy was directed to the repression of the more turbulent nobles who were opposed to him; and he soon made them feel the weight of his hand by hanging some, banishing others, and persecuting several more. But he too recognized the expediency of winning the popular favour. He was the first senator to add to his title that of captain of the people (“Almae Urbis Senator Ill: et Romani Populi Capitaneus ”). He befriended the people by promoting the organization of guilds after the manner of those of his native Bologna. There were already a few in Rome, such as the merchants’ guild and that of the agriculturists, Bobacteriorum or Bovattari, who must have resembled the so-called mercαnti di campagna or graziers of the present day, since no peasant guild existed in Italian republics. The merchants’ guild, definitely established in 1255 under Brancaleone’s rule, had four consuls and twelve councillors, held meetings, and made laws. The other guilds, thirteen in all, were organized much on the same plan. The admission of their heads into the councils of the republic in 1267 shows how efficaciously their interests had been promoted by Brancaleone.

The death of Innocent IV. and the election of Alexander

IV. (1254-61), who was milder and less shrewd than his predecessor, were favourable events for Brancaleone; but he failed to check the growing discontent of the clergy and the more powerful nobles, who had received deadly injuries at his hands. And when, on the expiration of his three years’ term of office, his re-election was proposed, his enemies rose against him, accused him before the sindαcato, threw him into prison, and vehemently protested against the continuance of “foreign tyranny.” His life was only spared on account of the hostages sent to Bologna. The next senator chosen was a Brescian Guelf, Emanuele de Madio, a tool of the nobles,- who were now masters of the situation. But soon afterwards, in 1257, the guilds rose in revolt, drove the nobles from power, put the pope to flight, and recalled Brancaleone for another three years’ term. He ruled more sternly than before, hung several nobles, and made alliance with Manfred, the representative of the Swabian party in Italy. This rendered him increasingly odious to the pope and procured his excommunication. But, disregarding the thunders of the church, he marched against Anagni, the pope’s birthplace, and Alexander was quickly obliged to humiliate himself before the senator of Rome. Brancaleone next set to work to destroy the fortified towers of the nobility, and in razing them to the ground ruined many of the adjacent dwellings. Accordingly, a considerable number of nobles became homeless exiles. In 1258, while engaged on the siege of Corneto, Brancaleone was attacked by a violent fever, and, being carried back to Rome, died on the Capitoline Hill. Thus ended the career of a truly remarkable statesman. He was succeeded by his uncle, Castellano degli Andalo, who, lacking the political genius of his nephew, only retained office until the following spring (1259), in the midst of fierce and perpetual disturbances. Then the people, being bribed by the pope, joined with the nobles and drove him away. His life too was saved by having followed his nephew’s shrewd plan of sending hostages to Bologna. Two senators of Roman birth were next elected; and on the death of Alexander IV. a French pope was chosen, Urban IV. (1261-64), thus giving fresh predominance in the church to the anti-Swabian policy. But the internal disturbances of the city soon drove Urban to flight.

At this period the fall of the empire had induced many Italian republics to seek strength by placing their governments in the hands of some prince willing to swear respect to their laws and to undertake their defence against neighbouring states and the pope. In Rome the Guelfs and Ghibellines proposed various candidates for this office, and after many fierce quarrels ended by electing a committee of boni homines, charged with the revision of the statutes, reorganization of the city, and choice of a senator. This committee sat for more than a year without nominating any one, so, the Guelf party being now predominant, and all being wearied of this provisional state of things, the majority agreed on the election as senator of Charles of Anjou, who, at the pope’s summons, was already preparing for the conquest of Naples. He would defend Rome against the pope, and the pope would defend Rome against him. By thus taking advantage of either’s jealousy the citizens hoped to keep their republic intact. In fact, although Urban IV. had incited Charles to attack Naples, he was by no means willing to see him established as master in Rome. He accordingly declared that, if Charles really wished to obtain the Neapolitan crown, he must only accept the offered dignity pending the conquest of that kingdom. And he must likewise promise to recognize the supremacy of the pope over the senate. Charles soothed him with the amplest verbal promises, but in fact accepted the senatorship for life. In 1265, when Urban was succeeded by Clement IV. (1265-68), who as a Provençal was a subject of Charles, the latter entered Rome and was immediately made senator. Seven days later (28th June) he received the investiture of the Neapolitan kingdom, and in the following January its crown. On the 26th February 1266 the battle of Benevento was fought, and, the valiant Manfred being killed, the triumph of the Guelf Angevins in Italy was assured. Then, at the urgent command of the pope, Charles was forced to resign the senatorship in the May of the same year. Two Romans were elected in his stead, but soon fell out with the pope, because the Guelf nobles again tried to exercise tyranny. The people, however, profited by these disturbances to rise on its own account, and formed a democratic government of twenty-six boni homines with Angelo Capocci, a Ghibelline, as its captain. By this government Don Henry, son of Ferdinand III. of Castile, was elected senator; and he came to Rome for the purpose of promoting a Ghibelline and Swabian policy in favour ' of Conradin, who was preparing for conflict. The rule of the new senator was very energetic, for he kept down the clergy, subdued the Campagna, persecuted the Guelf nobles, made alliance with the Tuscan Ghibellines, forcibly drove back the troops of King Charles, who was advancing towards Rome, and gave a splendid reception to Conradin. But the battle of Tagliacozzo (23rd August 1268), followed by the murder of Conradin, proved fatal to the Ghibelline party. Charles was re-elected senator immediately after the battle, and the pope confirmed his powers for a term of ten years, after having already named him imperial vicar in Tuscany. On the 16th September Charles for the second time took possession of the Capitol, and ruled Rome firmly by means of vice-governors or vicars.

The Swabian line was now extinct, and in Charles’s hands the Neapolitan kingdom had become a fief of the church. The empire had fallen so low as to be no longer formidable. Now therefore was the moment for treating with it in order to restrain Charles, and also for making use of the French king to keep the empire in check. And this was the policy of Nicholas III. (1277-80), who hastened to extract advantageous promises from Rudolph [9:20:798]of Hapsburg, the new candidate for the imperial crown.

In 1278, the ten years’ term having expired, he deprived

Charles of the senatorship and appointed Rudolph vicar of Tuscany. After declaring that he left to the people the right of electing the senator, he promulgated a new constitution (18th July 1278) which, while confirming the rights of the church over the city, prohibited the election of any foreign emperor, prince, marquis, count, or baron as senator of Rome. Thus the Colonna, Savelli, Orsini, Annibaldi, and other Roman nobles again rose to power, and the republic was again endangered and plunged in disorder. The Romans then gave the reconstitution of the city into the pope’s hands by yielding to him the right of nominating senators, declaring, however, that this was a personal concession to himself, and not to the popes in general. So Nicholas proceeded to name senators, alternating a Colonna with au Orsini, or simultaneously choosing one of each faction. The same power over the senate was granted with the same restriction to AIartin

IV. (1281-85), and he at once re-elected Charlesof Anjou. Thus, greatly to the disgust of the Romans, the Capitol was again invaded by French vicars, notaries, judges, and soldiery. But the terrible blow dealt at Charles’s power by the Sicilian A r espers (31st AIarch 1282) resounded even in Rome. The Orsini, backed by the people, rose to arms, massacred the French garrison, and quickly re-established a popular Government. Giovanni Cencio, a kinsman of the Orsini, was elected captain and defender of the people, and ruled the city with the co-operation of the senator and a council of priors of the guilds. This Government was of brief duration, for, although the pope had professed his willingness to tolerate the experiment, he quickly arranged fresh terms, and, forsaking Charles of Anjou, again nominated two Roman senators. Pope and king both died in 1285, and Nicholas IV. (1288-92), also holding sway over the senate, favoured the Colonna in order to curb the growing mastery of the Orsini. But thus there were two powerful houses instead of one. In fact Giovanni Colonna, when elected senator, ruled from the Capitol as an independent sovereign, conducted in person the campaign against Viterbo, and subjected that city to the republic on the 3d AIay 1291.

AVhen one of the Gaetani, Boniface VIIL (1294-1303), was raised to the papal chair, the extent of the Colonnas’ power became evident to all. Boniface opposed them in order to aggrandize his own kin, and they showed equal virulence in return. The Cardinals Colonna refused to acknowledge him as the legitimate pope, and he excommunicated them and proclaimed a crusade against their house. Even after he had subdued them and destroyed Palestrina, their principal fief, the drama did not yet come to an end. Boniface had a very lofty conception of the church, and desired to establish her supremacy over the state. The king of France (Philip the Fair) believed, on the contrary, that the Angevin successes entitled him to fill the place in Italy vacated by the Swabians, and to play the master there. This led to a tremendous contest in which all the French sided with their king. And shortly afterwards a plot was hatched against the pope by the agents of France and the Colonna. These determined enemies of the pope met with much favour in Rome, on account of the general irritation against the Gaetani and the enormous power conferred on them by Boniface. Suffice it to say that they were now lords of the whole of lower Latium, from Capo Circeo to Ninfa, from Ceprano to Subiaco. Thus Sciarra Colonna and a Frenchman named Nogaret were able to fall on the pope at Anagni, insult him, and take him prisoner. The people rising to his rescue, the conspirators were put to flight. But when Boniface returned to Rome with the escort and protection of the

Orsini, who had made themselves masters of the city, he found that he was virtually a captive in their hands. PIe felt this so keenly that he died of rage and exhaustion onthe Ilth October 1303. The brief pontificate of his successor Benedict XI. was followed by that of Clement

V. (1305-14), a Frenchman, who, instead of coming to Rome, summoned the cardinals to France. This was the beginning of the church’s so-called exile in Avignon, which, although depriving Rome of a source of wealth and influence, left the republic to pursue its own course. It ' employed this freedom in trying to hold its own against 1 the nobles, whose power was much lessened by the absence ’ of the pope, and endeavoured to gain fresh strength by , organizing the thirteen regions, which, as we have shown, . were associations of a much firmer nature in Rome thau the 1 guilds. Accordingly, in 1305, a captain of the people was elected with thirteen elders and a senator, Paganino della Torre, who governed for one year. The pope was opposed to these changes at first, but in 1310 he issued a brief granting Rome full permission to select its own form of government. Thus, the first pope in Avignon restored the rights of the Romans. But the latter, even with church and empire so far removed, still considered Rome the Eternal City, the source of all law, and the only natural seat of the spiritual and temporal government of the world. To their republic, they thought, appertained a new and lofty destiny, nor could it ever be content to descend to the level of other Italian municipalities.

On the 6th January 1309 Henry VII. was crowned king 1 of the Romans at Aix-la-Chapelle; and so greatly were men’s minds changed in Italy that, throughout the land, he was hailed as a deliverer. He w r ished to restore the grandeur of the empire, and the Italians, above all Dante Alighieri, beheld in him the champion of the state against the church, who, after becoming the foe of communal liberty, had forsaken Italy and withdrawn to France. The Roman people shared these ideas, and awaited Henry with equal impatience, but the nobles rose in opposition. The Orsini, leaders of the Guelfs, and allied with Robert of Naples, took possession of Castle St Angelo and the Trastevere. Hence, when Henry reached Rome in Alay 1312, after seizing the iron crown at AIilan, he was obliged to act on the offensive. He took the Capitol by assault, but, failing in his attack on Castle St Angelo, was pursued by its Neapolitan garrison. Forsaken by many discouraged adherents, he was forced to recognize the expediency of departure. First, however, he desired to be crowned at the Lateran, St Peter’s being held by his foes. The cardinals refused his request, but were compelled to yield by the threats of the people, who, reasserting their ancient rights, insisted that the coronation should take place without delay. And the ceremony was performed on the 29th June 1312. The emperor then resolved to depart in spite of the popular protest against his leaving the natural seat of the empire, and on the 20th August started for Tuscany, where worse fortune awaited him.

Their differences settled, the nobles expelled the cap-J tain of the people left by Henry, and elected as senators * Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. But this was the θ signal for a popular revolt. The Capitol was attacked, the p senators put to flight, and Jacopo Arlotti elected captain with a council of twenty-six worthies lbuoni homini ∖ The new leader instantly summoned the chief nobles before his tribunal, had them chained and cast into prison, and demolished many of their houses and strongholds. But, having thus humiliated their pride, Arlotti dared not put them to death, and, releasing them from confinement, banished them to their estates, where they plunged into hostile preparations. Aleanwhile the victorious people convoked a parliament and decreed that, the aristocracy [9:20:799]being now overthrown, the tribunitia potestas alone should invite the emperor to make his triumphal entry into the Capitol, and receive his authority from the people of Rome. This conception of the Roman power will now be seen to become more and more definite until finding its last expression in Cola di Rienzo. Pope Clement, resigning himself to necessity, acknowledged the new government under the energetic rule of Arlotti. The latter now joined the Ghibellines of the Campagna against the Orsini and the Neapolitans, subdued Velletri, and gave it a podestà. But then the Gaetani, who were Guelfs, united with the Orsini and the Neapolitans, and, giving battle to the Ghibellines in the Campagna, routed them in such wise as to put an end to the popular government. The nobles forced their way into the city, attacked the Capitol, made Arlotti their prisoner, and re-elected the senators Sciarra Colonna and Francesco Orsini. Close upon these reverses came the death of Henry VIL (24th August 1313) at Buonconvento near Siena, which put an end to the Ghibel-Iine party in Italy. Thereupon King Robert of Naples, being named senator by the pope, immediately appointed a vicar in Rome. Clement likewise profited by the vacancy of the imperial throne to name the king imperial vicar in Tuscany. And he died on the 20th April 1314, well content to have witnessed the triumphs of the Guelfs in Italy.

Affairs took a fresh turn under Pope John XXII. (1316-34). Rome was still ruled by the vicars of King Robert; but, owing to the continued absence of the popes, matters grew daily worse. Trade and industry declined, revenue diminished, the impoverished nobles were exceedingly turbulent, deeds of murder and violence occurred on all sides; even by day the streets of the city were unsafe. Hence there was universal discontent. Meanwhile Louis the Bavarian, who in 1314 had been crowned king of the Romans, having overcome his German enemies at Mühldorf in 1322, turned against the pope, one of his fiercest opponents. ∙ Louis was surrounded by Minorite friars, supporters of the poverty of the church, and consequently enemies to the temporal power. They were men of the stamp of William of Occam, Marsilio of Padua, Giovanni Janduno, and other philosophers favourable to the rights of the empire and the people. Accordingly the Italian Ghibellines hailed Louis as they had previously hailed Henry. Even the Roman people were roused to action, and, driving out the representatives and partisans of King Robert, in the spring of 1327, seized on Castle St Angelo, and again established a democratic government. “Nearly all Italy was stirred to new deeds,” says G. Villani, “and the Romans rose to arms and organized the people” (bk. x. c. 20). Regardless of the reproofs of the pope, they elected a haughty Ghibelline, Sciarra Colonna, captain of the people and general of the militia, with a council of fifty-two popolani, four to each region. Then, ranged under the standards of the militia, the Romans gave chase to the foes of the republic, and Sciarra, returning victorious, ascended to the Capitol and invited Louis the Bavarian to Rome. Thesummons was obeyed; on the 7th January 1328 the king was already encamped in the Neronian Fields with five thousand horse and a considerable number of foot soldiers, and, with better fortune than Henry VII., was able to enter the Vatican at once.

Encircled by a crowd of heretics, reformers, and Minorite brethren, he convoked a parliament on the Capitol, asking that the imperial crown might be conferred upon him by the people, from whom alone he wished to receive it. And the people proclaimed him their captain, senator, and emperor. On the 17th January his coronation took place in St Peter’s. But, as he had neither money nor practical sense, his method of taxation and the excesses committed by himself and his over-excited philosophers speedily aroused the popular discontent. His ecclesiastical vicar, Marsilio of Padua, and Giovanni Janduno placarded the walls with insulting manifestoes against the pope, whom the Minorites stigmatized as a heretic and wished to depose. In April Louis twice assembled the parliament in St Peter’s Square, and, after obtaining its sanction to several anti-papal edicts, declared John XXII. degraded and deposed as a heretic. This was a very strange and novel spectacle, the more so that, as was speedily proved, the Romans were stirred by no anti-Catholic spirit, no yearning for religious reform. Jacopo Colonna, a canon of the Lateran, was able to make his way into Rome with four masked companions, to publicly read, at the top of his voice and before a great multitude, the excommunication launched against the emperor by the deposed pope, to traverse the entire city, and to withdraw unmolested to Palestrina. Meanwhile the emperor contented himself with decreeing that henceforth the popes must reside in Rome,—that if, when invited, they should fail to come they would be thereby held deposed from the throne. As a logical consequence, proceedings were immediately begun for the election of the new pope, Nicholas V., who on the 12th May was proclaimed by the popular voice in St Peter’s Square, and received the imperial sanction. But this ephemeral drama came to an end when the emperor departed with his antipope on the 4th August. This caused the immediate downfall of the democratic Government. Bertoldo Orsini, who had returned to Rome with his Guelfs, and Stefano Colonna were elected senators, and confirmed in the office by Cardinal Giovanni Orsini in the name of the pope. A new parliament cancelled the emperor’s edicts, and had them burnt by the public executioner. Later, Nicholas, the antipope, went with a rope about his neck to make submission to John XXII., and Louis promised to disavow and retract all that he had done against the church, provided the sentence of excommunication were withdrawn. This, however, was refused. Never had the empire fallen so low. Meanwhile King Robert was again supreme in Rome, and, being reelected senator, appointed vicars there as before. Anarchy reigned. The city was torn by factions, and the provinces rebelled against the French representatives of the pope, who, in their ignorance of Italian affairs, were at a loss how to act.

And after the election of Benedict XII. (1334-42) confusion reached so great a pitch that, on the expiration of Robert’s senatorial term, the Romans named thirteen heads of regions to carry on the government with two senators, while the king still sent vicars as before. The people, for the sake of peace, once more granted the supremacy of the senate to the pope, and he nominated two knights of Gubbio, Giacomo di Cante dei Gabrielli and Bosone Novello dei Gabrielli, who were succeeded by two other senators the following year. But in 1339 the Romans attacked the Capitol, named two senators of their own choice, re-established a democratic Government, and sent ambassadors to Florence to ask for the ordinances of justice Iprdinamenti della giustizia), by which that city had broken the power of the nobles, and also that a few skilled citizens should lend their help in the reconstitution of Rome. Accordingly some Florentines came with the Ordinamenti, some portions of which may be recognized in the Roman statutes, and, after first rearranging the taxes, elected thirteen priors of the guilds, a gonfalonier of justice, and a captain of the people after the Florentine manner. But there was a dissimilarity in the conditions of the two cities. The guilds having little influence in Rome, the projected reform failed, and the pope, who was opposed to it, re-elected the senators.
[9:20:800]

Thereupon public discontent swelled, and especially when, by the foundation of the papal palace of Avignon, it was evident that Benedict XII. had no intention of restoring the Holy See to Italy. This pope was succeeded in 1342 by Clement VI. (1342-52), and King Robert in 1343 by his niece Joanna; and the latter event, while plunging the kingdom in anarchy, likewise aggravated the condition of Rome. For not only were the Neapolitan sovereigns still very powerful there, but the principal Roman nobles held large fiefs across the Neapolitan borders.

Shortly before this another revolution in Rome had re-established the government of the Thirteen and the two senators. The people, being anxious to show their intention of respecting the papal authority, had despatched to Avignon as ambassador of the republic, in 1343, a man destined to make much noise in the world. This was Cola di Rienzo, sou of a Roman innkeeper, a notary, and an impassioned student of the Bible, the fathers, Livy, Seneca, Cicero, and Valerius Maximus. Thoroughly imbued with a half pagan half Christian spirit, he believed that he had a divinely inspired mission to revive the ancient glories of Rome. Of handsome presence, full of fantastic eloquence, and stirred to enthusiasm by contemplation of the ruined monuments of Rome, he harangued the people with a stilted oratory that enchanted their ears. He hated the nobles, because one of his brothers had been killed by them; he loved the republic, and in its name addressed a stately Latin speech to the astonished pope, and, offering him the supreme power, besought his instant return to Rome. He also begged him to allow the city to celebrate a jubilee every fifty years, and then, as a personal request, asked to be nominated notary to the urban chamber. The pope consented to everything, and Rienzi communicated this good news to Rome in an emphatically worded epistle. After Easter, in 1344, he returned to Rome, and found to his grief that the city was a prey to the nobles. He immediately began to admonish the latter, and then, draped in a toga adorned with symbols, exhibited and explained allegorical designs to the people, and announced the speedy restoration of the past grandeur of Rome. Finally he and a few burghers and merchants, whom he had secretly inflamed by his discourses, made a solemn vow to overthrow the nobility and consolidate the republic. The moment was favourable, owing to the anarchy of Naples, the absence of the pope, the weakness of the empire, and the disputes of the barons, although the latter were still very potent and constituted, as it were, a separate government opposed to that of the people. Rienzi, having gained the pope’s ecclesiastical vicar to his side, passed in prayer the night of the 19th May 1347, placing his enterprise under the protection of the Holy Spirit, and the following day marched to the Capitol, surrounded by his adherents, convoked a parliament of the people, and obtained its sanction for the following proposals :—that all pending lawsuits should be at once decided; that justice should be equally administered to all; that every region should equip one hundred foot soldiers and twenty-five horse; that the dues and taxes should be rearranged; that the forts, bridges, and gates of the city should be held by the rector of the people instead of by the nobility; and that granaries should be opened for the public use. On the same day, amid general homage and applause, Rienzi was proclaimed head of the republic, with the title of tribune and liberator of the Holy Roman Republic, “by authority of the most merciful Lord Jesus Christ.” The nobles withdrew scoffing but alarmed. Rienzi engaged a body-guard of one hundred men, and assumed the command of thirteen hundred infantry and three hundred and ninety light horse; he abolished the senators, retained the Thirteen and the general and special councils, and set the administration on a new footing. These measures and the prompt submission of the other cities of the state brought an instant increase of revenue to Rome.

This revolution, as will be noted, was of an entirely novel stamp. For its leader despatched envoys to all the cities of Italy, exhorting them to shake off the yoke of their tyrants, and send representatives to the parliament convoked for the 1st August, inasmuch as the liberation of Rome also implied the “liberation of the sacred land of Italy.” In Rienzi’s judgment the Roman revolution must be, not municipal, but national, and even in some points universal. And this idea was welcomed with general enthusiasm throughout the peninsula. Solemn festivals and processions were held in Rome; and, when the tribune went in state to St Peter’s, the canons met him on the steps chanting the Veni, Creator Spimtus. Even the pope, willingly or unwillingly, accorded his approval to Rienzi’s deeds. The provincial cities did homage to Rome and her tribune, and almost all the rest of Italy gave him its enthusiastic adherence. The ancient sovereign people seemed on the point of resuscitation. And others besides the multitude were fascinated and carried off their feet. Great men like Petrarch were transported with joy. The poet lauded Cola di Rienzo as a sublime and supernatural being, the greatest of ancient and modern men. But it was soon evident that all this enthusiasm was mainly factitious. On the 26th of July a new parliament was called, and this decreed that all the rights and privileges granted to the empire and church must now be vested in the Roman people, from whom they had first emanated. But on the convocation of the national parliament few representatives obeyed the summons and the scheme was a failure. All had gone well so long as principles only were proclaimed, but when words had to be followed by deeds the municipal feeling awoke and distrust began to prevail. Nevertheless, on the 1st August Rienzi assumed the spurs of knighthood and passed a decree declaring that Rome would now resume her old jurisdiction over the world, invoking the Holy Spirit upon Italy, granting the Roman citizenship to all her cities, and proclaiming them free in virtue of the freedom of Rome. This was a strange jumble of the ancient Roman idea combined with the mediaeval. It was a dream of Rienzi’s brain, but it was also the dream of Dante and Petrarch. The conception of the empire and the history of Italy, particularly that of ancient and mediaeval Rome, were inevitably preparing the way for the national idea. This Rienzi foresaw, and this constitutes the true grandeur of his character, which in other respects was not exempt from pettiness and infirmity. He pursued his course, therefore, undismayed, and had indeed gone too far to draw back. On the 15th August he caused himself to be crowned tribune with great pomp, and confirmed the rights of Roman citizenship to all natives of Italy. But practical matters had also to be taken into account, and it was here that his weakness and lack of judgment were shown. The nobles remained steadily hostile, and refused to yield to the charm of his words. Hence conflict was unavoidable; and at first Rienzi succeeded in vanquishing the Gaetani by means of Giovanni Colonna. He next endeavoured to suppress the Guelf and Ghibelline factions, and to restore Italy to “holy union” by raising her from her present abasement.

The pope, however, was weary of toleration, and, coming to terms with the nobles, incited them to war. They accordingly moved from Palestrina, and on the 30th November were encamped before Rome. Rienzi now put forth his energy. He had already called the militia to arms, and a genuine battle took place in which eighty [9:20:801]nobles, chiefly of the Colonna clan, were left dead. This was a real catastrophe to them, and the aristocracy never again achieved the rule of the republic. But Rienzi’s head was turned by this sudden success. In great need of money, he began to play the tyrant by levying taxes and exacting instant obedience. The papal legate saw his opportunity and seized it, by threatening to bring a charge of heresy against the tribune. Rienzi was dismayed. He declared himself friendly to the pope and willing to respect his authority; and he even sought to conciliate the nobles. At this moment certain Neapolitan and Hungarian captains, after levying soldiers with the tribune’s consent, joined the nobles and broke out in revolt. On their proving victorious in a preliminary encounter with some of Rienzi’s guards, the tribune suddenly lost heart, resigned the power he had held for seven months, and took refuge with a few trusty adherents in Castle St Angelo, on the 15th December 1347. Thence he presently fled to Naples, vainly hoping to find aid, and afterwards disappeared for some time from the scene.

Meanwhile the Romans remained tranquil, intent on making money by the jubilee; but no sooner was this over than disorders broke out and the tyranny of the baronage recommenced. To remedy this state of things, application was made to the pope. He consulted with a committee of cardinals, who sought the advice of Petrarch, and the poet suggested a popular government, to the complete exclusion of the nobles, since these, he said, were strangers who ruined the city. The people had already elected the Thirteen, and now, encouraged by these counsels, on the 26th December 1351 chose Giovanni Perrone as head of the republic. But the new leader was unable to withstand the hostilities of the nobles; and in September 1353 Prancesco Baroncelli was elected tribune. He was a follower of Rienzi, had been his ambassador to Florence, and did little beyond imitating his mode of government and smoothing the way for his return.

Rienzi had spent two years in the Abruzzi, leading a life of mystic contemplation on Monte Maiella. Then, in 1350, he had gone to Prague and endeavoured to convert to his ideas the yet uncrowned emperor Charles IV. When apparently on the point of success, he was sent under arrest to the new pope, Innocent VI. (1352-62), a man of great shrewdness and practical sense. On Rienzi’s arrival at Avignon it became evident that his popularity was still very great, and that it would be no easy task to dispose of him. The Romans were imploring his return; Petrarch lauded him as a modern Gracchus or Scipio; and the pope finally released him from confinement. Innocent had decided to send to Italy, in order to settle affairs and bring the state into subjection to the church, that valiant captain and skilled politician, Cardinal Albornoz. And, having no fear that the latter’s hand would be forced, he further decided that Rienzi should be sent to give him the support of his own popularity in Rome. In fact directly the pair arrived Baroncelli was overthrown, the supremacy of the senate granted to the pope, and the government confided to Albornoz, who, without concerning himself with Rienzi, nominated Guido Patrizi as senator. He then marched at the head of his troops against Giovanni, prefect of Vico, and forced him to render submission at Montefiascone on the 5th June 1354. With the same promptitude and skill he reduced Umbria and the Tuscan and Sabine districts, consented to leave the privileges of the cities intact in return for their recognition of the papal authority, and planted fortresses in suitable positions. In the meantime Rienzi’s popularity was increasing in Rome; without either money or arms, the ex-tribune succeeded by his eloquence in winning over the two Provençal leaders, brothers of the famous free captain Fra Monreale; and, seduced by his promises and hopes, they supplied him with funds. Then, profiting by his prestige, the apparent favour of the pope, and the sums received, he was able to collect a band of five hundred soldiers of mixed nationalities and returned towards Rome. On Monte Mario he was met by the cavallerotti. On the 1st August 1354 he entered the Castello gate, took possession of the government, named Monreale’s two brothers his captains, and sent them to lay siege to Palestrina, which was still the headquarters of the Colonna. But then money ran short, and he again lost his head. Inviting Fra Monreale to a banquet, he put him to death for the sake of his wealth, and kept the two brothers in confinement. This act excited general indignation. And when, after his ill-gotten gains were spent, he again recurred to violence to fill his purse, the public discontent was vented in a sudden revolt on the 8th October. The people stormed the Capitol with cries of “Death to the traitor.” Rienzi presented himself at a window waving the flag of Rome. But the charm was finally broken. Missiles were hurled at him; the palace was fired. He hid himself in the courtyard, shaved his beard, and, disguised as a shepherd with a cloth over his head, slipped into the crowd and joined in their cries against himself. Being recognized, however, by the golden bracelets he had forgotten to remove, he was instantly stabbed. For two days his corpse was left exposed to the insults of the mob, and was then burned. Such was the wretched end of the man who, at one moment, seemed destined to fill the world with his name as the regenerator of Rome and of Italy.

In all the Italian cities the overthrow of the aristocracy had led to military impotence and pressing danger of tyranny. The same thing had happened in Rome when the nobility, weakened by the absence of church and empire, received its death blow from Rienzi. But, whereas elsewhere tyrants were gradually arising in the citizen class, Rome was always in danger of oppression by the pope. Nor was any aid available from the empire, which had never recovered from its abasement under Louis the Bavarian. In fact, when Charles of Luxembourg came to Rome to be crowned, he was obliged to promise the pope that he would not enter the city. On Easter day 1355 he received the crown, and departed, after counselling the Romans to obey the pope. And the pontiffs had greater need than ever of an established kingdom. Their position in France was much endangered by that country’s disorder. New states were being formed on all sides; the mediaeval unity was shattered; and the shrunken spiritual authority of the church increased her need of material strength. As Italian affairs stood, it would be easy for the popes to found a kingdom, but their presence was required in Rome before it could be firmly established. The blood-stained sword of Albornoz had prepared the way before them. In 1355-56 he vanquished the lords or tyrants of Rimini, Fano, Fossombrone, Pesaro, Urbino, and other cities. And all these places had been so rudely oppressed that the cardinal was often hailed as a liberator after subduing their masters by fire , and sword. But everywhere he had been obliged to leave existing Governments and rulers in statu quo after exacting their oaths of fealty. Thus the state was still dissevered, and it was impossible to bind it together with the pope at Avignon and Rome a republic. Bologna was still independent, Ordelaffi still lord of Forli; Cesena and other cities were still rebellious; and the Campagna was still in the hands of the barons. Some places were ruled by rectors nominated by the pope; at Montefiascone there was an ecclesiastical rector, with a bench of judges, and a captain commanding a mixed band of adventurers. Rome had submitted to the haughty cardinal, but hated him [9:20:802]mortally, and, on his departure for Avignon in 1357 to assist the threatened pontiff, immediately conceded to the latter the supremacy of the senate. And the pope, instead of two senators, hastened to name a single one of foreign birth. This was a shrewd device of Albornoz and another blow to the nobles, with whom he was still at war. Thus was inaugurated, by the nomination of Raimondo de’ Tolomei in 1358, a series of foreign senators, fulfilling the functions of a podestà, and changed every six months, together with their staff of judges, notaries, and knights. The people approved of this reform as being inimical to the nobles and favourable to the preservation of liberty. Hitherto the senators had been assisted, or rather kept in check, by the thirteen representatives of the regions. These were now replaced by seven reformers, in imitation of the priors of Florence, the better to follow that city’s example. The reformers were soon the veritable chiefs of the republic. They first appeared in 1360, were either popolani or cavallerotti, and were elected by ballot every three months. When Albornoz returned to Italy, although desirous to keep Rome in the same subjection as the other cities, he had first to vanquish Ordelaffi and reduce Bologna. The latter enterprise was the more difficult task, and provoked a lengthy war with Matteo Visconti of Milan. Thus Rome, being left to herself, continued to be governed by her reformers; and the nobles, already shut out from power, were also excluded from the militia, which had been reorganized, like that of Florence, on the democratic system. Three thousand men, mostly archers, were enrolled under the command of two banderesi, “in the likeness,” says M. Villani, “of our gonfaloniers of the companies,” with four antepositi constituting a supreme council of war. And the whole body was styled the “Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum.” It was instituted to support the reformers and re-establish order in the city and Campagna, to keep down the nobles and defend the republic. It fulfilled these duties with much, and sometimes excessive, severity. Banderesi and antepositi had seats in the special council beside those of the reformers, as, in Florence, the gonfaloniers of the companies were seated beside the priors. Later these officials constituted the so-called signoriα dei banderesi. In 1362, the Romans having subjected Velletri, which was defended by the nobles, the latter made a riot in Rome. Thereupon the banderesi drove them all from the city, killed some of their kindred, and did not even spare the cavallerotti. The fight became so furious that from gate to gate all Rome w y as in arms, and even mercenaries were hired. But in the end renewed submission was made to the pope.

On the death of Innocent VI. in 1362, an agreement was concluded with his successor Urban V. (1362-70), also a Frenchman, who was obliged to give his sanction to the government of the reformers and banderesi. And then, Albornoz being recalled in disgrace to Avignon, and afterwards sent as legate to Naples, these Roman magistrates were able, with or without the co-operation of the foreign senator, to rule in their own way. They did justice on the nobles by hanging a few more; and they defended the city from the threatening attacks of the mercenaries, who had now become Italy’s worst foes. It was at this period that the Roman statutes were revised and rearranged in the compilation erroneously attributed by some writers to Albornoz, which has come down to us supplemented by alterations of a later date.

But now the popes, being no longer in safety at Avignon, really decided to return to Italy. Even Urban

V. had to pay ransom to escape from the threatened attacks of the free companies. The Romans implored his return, and he was further urged to it by the Italian literati with Petrarch at their head. In April 1367 he finally quitted Avignon, and, entering Rome on the 16th October, was given the lordship of the city. Cardinal Albornoz had fallen mortally ill at Viterbo, but, though unable to accompany the pope to Rome, had, before dying, suggested his course of action. Certainly Urban showed much acumen in profiting by the first burst of popular enthusiasm to effect quick and dexterous changes in the constitution of the republic. After naming a senator, he abolished the posts of reformers and banderesi, substituting three conservators, or rather a species of municipal council, alone charged with judicial and administrative powers, which has lasted to the present day. The thirteen leaders of the regions and the consuls of the guilds still sat in the councils, which were left unsuppressed. But all real power was in the hands of the pope, who, in Rome, as in his other cities, nominated the principal magistrates. Thus, by transforming political into civil institutions and concentrating the supreme authority in his own grasp, Urban V. dealt a mortal blow to the liberties of Rome. Yet he felt no sense of security among a people who, after the first rejoicings over the return of the Holy See, were always on the brink of revolt. Besides he felt himself a stranger in Italy, and was so regarded. Accordingly, in April 1370 he decided to return to France; on the 20th of that month he wrote from Viterbo that no change was to be made in the government; and he died in Avignon on the 19th of December.

The Romans retained the conservators, conferring on them the political power of the reformers; they re-established the banderesi with the Florentine title of executores justitiαe and the four antepositi with that of consiliarii. Thus the “Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum Urbis” was restored, and the two councils met as before. The new French pope, Gregory XI. (1370-78), had to be content with obtaining supremacy over the Senate and the possession of the Castle St Angelo. It was a difficult moment for him. The Florentines had come to an open rupture with his legates, and had adopted the expedient of inviting all the cities of the Roman state to redeem their lost freedom. Accordingly in 1375 many of them rose against the legates, who were mostly French and regarded with dislike as foreigners. Florentine despatches, full of classical allusions and chiefly composed by the famous scholar, Secretary Coluccio Salutati, were rapidly sent in all directions. Those addressed to the Romans were specially fervid, and emphatically appealed to their patriotism and memories of the past. But the Romans received them with doubt and mistrust, for they saw that the revolution threatened to dismember the state, by promoting the independence of every separate city. Besides, while maintaining their republic, they also desired the pope’s presence in Rome. Nevertheless they went with the current to the extent of reforming their constitution. In February 1376 they nominated Giovanni Cenci captain of the people, and gave him uncontrolled power over the towns of the patrimony and the Sabine land. The conservators, with their new political authority, the executores, the antepositi, and the two councils were all preserved, and a new magistracy was created, the “Très Gubernatores Pacis et Libertatis Reipublicae Romanae.” This answered to the Eight (afterwards Ten) of War in Florence, likewise frequently called the Eight of Liberty and Peace. It was this Council of Eight that was now directing the war against the pope and braving his sentence of excommunication; and their fiery zeal had won them the title of the Holy Eight from the Florentines.

Realizing that further absence would cost him his state, Gregory XI. quitted Avignon on the 13th September 1376, and, reaching Corneto in December, despatched to [9:20:803]Rome three legates, who, on the 2lst of the month, concluded an agreement with the parliament. The people gave up the gates, the fortresses, and the Trastevere, and promised that if the pope returned to Rome he should have the same powers which had been granted to Urban V. But, on his side, he must pledge himself to maintain the executores, their council, the Three of War, and allow the Romans the right of reforming the banderesi, who would then swear fealty to him. The terms of this peace and the pope’s epistles clearly prove that the two councils still exercised their functions, that the banderesi were still the virtual heads of the Government, and that their suppression was not contemplated. In fact, when the pope made his entry on the 17th January 1377 accompanied by two thousand armed men, he perceived that there was much public agitation, that the Romans did not intend to fulfil their agreement, and that the Government of the banderesi went on as before. Accordingly, after naming Gomez Albornoz, a nephew of the deceased cardinal, to the office of senator, he retired to Anagni, and remained there until November 1377. The Romans presently waited on him with conciliating offers, and begged him to negotiate a peace for them with the prefect of Vico. In fact the treaty was concluded at Anagni in October, and on the IOth November confirmed in Rome by the general council. The meeting was held in the great hall of the Capitol, “ubi consilia generalia urbis fieri soient,” in the presence of all the members of the republican Government. But the pope was enraged by the survival of this Government, and, being worn out by the persistent hostility of the Florentines, which reduced his power to a low ebb, had determined to make peace, when surprised by death on the 27th March 1378.

The next pope, Urban VI. (1378-89), a Neapolitan, was the spirit of discord incarnate. His election was not altogether regular: the French party among the cardinals was against him; and the people were ripe for insurrection. But, regardless of all this, Urban threatened the cardinals in his first consistory, saying that church reform must begin with them; and he used the same tone with the people, reproving them for failing to suppress the banderesi. In consequence of this the cardinals of the French party, assembling at Fondi, elected the antipope Clement VIL (1378-94) and started a long and painful schism in the church. Clement resided in Avignon, while Urban in Rome was engaged in opposing Queen Joanna I. of Naples and favouring Charles of Durazzo, who, on conquering the Neapolitan kingdom, was made gonfalonier of the church and senator of Rome, where he left a vicar as his deputy. Shortly afterwards the pope went to Naples, and made fierce war on the king. Then, after many adventures, during which he tortured and put to death several cardinals whom he suspected of hostile intentions, he returned to Rome, where the utmost disorder prevailed. The conservators and the banderesi were still at the head of the Government, and, the pope speedily falling out with them, a riot ensued, after which he excommunicated the banderesi. These at last made submission to him, and Urban VI. became master of Rome before his death in 1389. He was succeeded by Boniface IX. (1389-1404), another Neapolitan, but a man of greater shrewdness and capacity. His first act was to crown Ladislaus king of Naples, and secure the friendship and protection of this ambitious and powerful prince. In all the principal cities of the state he chose the reigning lords for his vicars. But he allowed Fermo, Ascoli, and Bologna the privilege of assuming their own vicariate for twenty-five years. And, as these different potentates and Governments had only to pay him an annual tribute, all parties were satisfied, and the pope was able to bestow at least an appearance of order and unity on his state. But fresh tumults soon arose, partly because the conservators and banderesi sought to govern on their own account, and especially because the pope seems for a time to have omitted naming the senator. Boniface was a prudent man; he saw that events were turning in his favour, now that throughout Italy liberty was tottering to its fall, and bided his time. He was satisfied for the moment by obtaining a recognition of the immunities of the clergy, rendering them solely amenable to ecclesiastical tribunals, and thus distinguishing the powers of the church from those of the state in Rome. The republic also pledged itself neither to molest the prelates nor to levy fresh contributions on them towards repairing the walls, to aid in recovering the estates of the church in Tuscia, and to try to conciliate the baronage. This concordat, concluded with the Conservatorsandbanderesionthe Ilth September 1391, was also confirmed on the 5th March 1392 by the heads of the regions, together with a fresh treaty binding both parties to furnish a certain number of armed men to combat the prefect of Vico and the adherents of the antipope at Viterbo. With the exception of this city, Orchi, and Civita Vecchia, all other conquered territory was to belong to the republic. But the Romans soon discovered that they were playing into the hands of the pope, who kept everything for himself, without even paying the troops. Upon this a riot broke out; Boniface fled to Perugia in October 1392, and resolved to exact better terms when next recalled to Rome. Meanwhile the Romans subdued the prefect, captured Viterbo, and, being already repentant, handed it over to the pope and implored his return. He then proposed his own terms, which were approved, not only by the conservators, banderesi, and four councillors, but also by the special council and by the unanimous vote of a general assembly composed of the above-mentioned authorities, heads of regions, other officials, and a hundred citizens (8th August 1393). These terms prescribed that the pope was to elect the senator, and that, on his failing so to do, the conservators would carry on the government after swearing fealty to him. The senatorial function was to be neither controlled nor hampered by the banderesi. The immunities of the clergy were to be preserved, and all church property was to be respected by the magistrates. The expenses of the pope’s journey were to be paid, and he was to be escorted to Rome in state. Boniface tried to complete his work by abolishing the banderesi, the last bulwarks of freedom; but the people, although weakened and weary, made efforts to preserve them, and, although their fall was inevitable, the struggle went on for some time.

During the spring of 1394 the banderesi provoked an insurrection in which the pope’s life was endangered; it was only saved by the arrival of King Ladislaus, who came from Naples with a large force in the early autumn. But for the Neapolitan soldiery Boniface could not have withstood the long series of revolts that continually exposed him to fresh perils and the anxiety caused by the persistent schism .of the church. The death of Clement VII. in 1394 was followed by the election of another antipope, Benedict XIII. But a new jubilee was in prospect for the year 1400, and this was always an efficacious means of bending the will of the Romans. Depending upon this and the assistance of Ladislaus, Boniface not only demanded full powers to nominate senators (none having been recently elected), but insisted on the suppression of the banderesi. Both requests were granted; but, directly Angelo Alaleoni was made senator, a conspiracy was hatched for the re-establishment of the banderesi. However, the pope felt sure of his strength; the plot was discovered and the conspirators were beheaded [9:20:804]on the stairs of the CapitoL This proved the end of the banderesi and of the liberties of Rome. The government was again directed by an alien senator together with three conservators, but the latter were gradually deprived of their political attributes, and became mere civil officers. The militia, regions, guilds, and other associations now rapidly lost all political importance, and before long were little more than empty names. Thus in 1398 the Romans submitted to the complete sway of the pope, and in July of the same year the senator chosen by him was Mala-testa dei Malatesti of Rimini, one of a line of tyrants, a valiant soldier, who was also temporal vicar and captain general of the church. Boniface continued to appoint foreign senators during the rest of his life; he fortified Castle St Angelo, the Vatican, and the Capitol; he stationed galleys at the mouth of the Tiber, and proved himself in all things a thoroughly temporal prince. He aggrandized all his kindred, especially his brother, and, with the aid of his senator, his armed force, and the protection of Ladislaus, succeeded in keeping down all the surviving nobles. In 1400, however, these made an attempt to upset the Government. Niccolb Colonna forced his way into the city with cries of “Popolo, popolo! death to Boniface !” But the Romans had grown deaf to the voice of liberty; they refused to rise, and the senator, a λ r enetian named Zaccaria Trevisan, behaved with much energy. Colonna and his men had to beat a swift retreat to Palestrina. A charge of high treason was immediately instituted against him, and thirty-one rebels were beheaded. The pope then proclaimed a crusade against all the Colonna, and sent a body of two thousand men and some of the Neapolitan soldiery to attack them. Several of their estates were seized and devastated, but Palestrina continued to hold out, and on the 7th January 1401 the Colonna finally made submission to the pope. Nevertheless they obtained advantageous terms, for Boniface left them their lands, appointed them vicars of other territories, and made similar agreements with the Gaetani and Orsini. In this way he became absolute master of Rome. One chronicler remarks that “Romanis tanquam rigidus imperator dominabatur,” and the same tone is taken by others. But he did not succeed in putting an end to the schism of the church, which was still going on when he died in the Vatican on the 1st October 1404.

Innocent VII. (1404-6) was the next pope. He too was a Neapolitan, and on his election the people again rose in revolt and refused to acknowledge him unless he consented to resign the temporal power. But Ladislaus of Naples hastened to his help, and an agreement was made which, under the cover of apparent concessions, really riveted the people’s chains. Rome was recognized as the seat of the temporal and spiritual sovereignty of the pope, and the pope continued to appoint the senator. The people were to elect seven governors of the city, who were to swear fealty to the pope and carry on the government in conjunction with three other governors chosen by the pontiff or Ladislaus. The stipulations of Boniface IX. concerning ecclesiastical immunities were again confirmed. Γhe barons were forbidden to place more than five lances each at the service of the people, and—which was the real gist of the covenant—the people were henceforth forbidden to make laws or statutes without the permission of the pope. The captain of the people, deprived of his political and judicial functions and reduced to a simple judge, was also to be chosen by the pope. But this treaty, drawn up on the 27th October 1404, was not signed at the time, and many difficulties and disturbances arose when its terms were to be put into effect. The Romans nominated the seven governors, but, without waiting until the pope had chosen three more, placed the state in their hands, and styled them governors of the liberty of the Roman republic. They were in fact banderesi or reformatori under a new name. But the attempt proved inefficacious, for, at the pope’s first threat of departure, the Romans made their submission, and the treaty of October was subscribed on the 15th May 1405. Nevertheless, as it only bears the signatures of the “seven governors of the liberty of the Roman republic,” the pope would seem to have made some concessions. His position was by no means assured. Ladislaus was known to aspire to absolute dominion in Italy, and, although willing to aid in suppressing the republic, tried to prepare the way for his own designs, and frequently held out a helping hand to the vanquished. On the 6th August fourteen influential citizens of Rome boldly presented themselves at the Vatican, and in a threatening manner called the pope to account for giving his whole attention to worldly things, instead of endeavouring to put a stop to the schisms of the church. But, on leaving his presence, they were attacked by Luigi Migliorati, the pope’s nephew, and notorious for his violence, who killed eleven of their number, including several heads of the regions and two of the governors. An insurrection ensued, and the pope and his nephew fled to Viterbo. The Colonna tried to profit by these events, and applied to Ladislaus, who, hoping that the moment had come to make himself master of Rome, sent the count of Troia thither with a troop of three thousand horse. But the people, enraged by this treachery, and determined not to fall under the yoke of Naples, awoke for an instant to the memory of their past glories, and bravely repulsed the Colonna and the Neapolitans. And, on the speedy arrival of the Orsini with some of the papal troops, the people voluntarily restored the papal government, and, assembling the parliament, besought the pope to return on his own terms. Accordingly, after first naming Francesco Panciatichi of Pistoia to the senatorship, the pope came back on the 13th March 1406, bringing his whole curia with him, and also the murderer Migliorati, who, triumphing in impunity, became more arrogant than before. Here indeed was a proof that the Romans were no longer worthy of liberty! And now, by means of the Orsini, Innocent had only to reduce the Colonna and other nobles raised to power by Ladislaus; nor was this very difficult, seeing that the king, in his usual fashion, abandoned them to their fate, and, making terms with the pope, was named gonfalonier of the church and again protected her cause.

Innocent, dying in 1406, was succeeded by Gregory XII., a Venetian, who, as we shall presently see, resigned the chair in 1415. On his accession, finding his state firmly established, he seemed to be seriously bent on putting an end to the Great Schism, and for that purpose arranged a meeting with the antipope Benedict XIII. at the congress of Savona in 1408. But Gregory and Benedict only used the congress as a pretext for making war upon each other, and were urged on by Ladislaus, who hoped by Aveakening both to gain possession of Rome, where, although opposed by the Orsini, he had the support of the Colonna. Gregory, who had then fled from Rome, made a momentary attempt to win the popular favour by restoring the government of the banderesi; but Ladislaus marched into Rome in June 1408 and established a senator of his oavπ. Meanwhile the two popes were continuing their shameful struggle, and the council of Pisa (March 1409), in attempting to check it, only succeeded in raising up a third pontiff, first in the person of Alexander V. (1409-10), and then in the turbulent Baldassare Cossa, who assumed the name of John XXIII. The latter began by sending a large contingent to assist Louis of Anjou against Ladislaus. But the enterprise failed, and, seeing himself deserted by all, Pope John next embraced the cause of his foe by [9:20:805]naming him gonfalonier of the church. Thereupon Ladislaus concluded a sham peace, and then, seizing Rome, put it to the sack and established his own government there. Thus John, like the other two popes, became a wanderer in Italy. In August 1414 Ladislaus died and was succeeded by the scandalous Queen Joanna II. The Roman people promptly expelled the Neapolitans, and Cardinal Isolani, John’s legate, succeeding in rousing a reaction in favour of the church, constituted a government of thirteen “conservators” on the 19th October.

In November 1414 the council of Constance assembled, and at last ended the schism by deposing all the popes, and incarcerating John XXIII., the most turbulent of the three. On the Ilth November 1417 Oddo Colonna was unanimously elected to the papal chair; he was consecrated in the cathedral on the 27 th as Pope Martin V., and, being acknowledged by all, hastened without delay to take possession of his see. Meanwhile disorder was at. its height in Rome. The cardinal legate Isolani ’ governed as he best could, while Castle St Angelo remained in the hands of the Neapolitans, who still had a party in the city. In this divided state of affairs Braccio, a daring captain of adventurers, nicknamed Fortebraccio, was inspired with the idea of making himself master of Rome. Overcoming the feeble resistance opposed to him, he succeeded in this on the l6th June 1416 and assumed the title of “Defensor Urbis.” But Joanna of Naples despatched Sforza, an equally valiant captain, against him, and, without offering battle, Fortebraccio withdrew on the 26th August, after having been absolute master of the eternal city for seventy days. Sforza marched in on the

27th, and took possession of the city in the name of Joanna. Martin V. instantly proved himself a good statesman. He confirmed the legate Isolani as his vicar, and Giovanni Savelli as senator. Leaving Constance on the 16th May 1418, he reached Milan on the 12th October, and slowly proceeded on his journey. While in Florence he despatched his brother and nephew to Naples to make alliance with Joanna, and caused her to be crowned on the 28th October 1419 by his legate Morosini. Upon this she promised to give up Rome to the pope. Her general, Sforza, then entered the service of Martin V., and compelled Fortebraccio, who was lingering in a threatening attitude at Perugia, to make peace with the pope. The latter entrusted Fortebraccio with the conduct of the campaign against Bologna, and that city was reduced to submission on the 15 th July 1420. The Romans had already yielded to Martin’s brother the legate, and now earnestly besought the arrival of their pope. Accordinglyhe left Florence on the 19th September 1420, and entered the Vatican on the 28th. Rome was in ruins; nobility and burghers were equally disorganized, the people unable to bear arms and careless of their rights, while the battered walls of the Capitol recorded the fall of two republics.

Martin V. had now to fulfil a far more difficult task than that of taking possession of Rome. Throughout Italy municipal freedom was overthrown, and the Roman republic had ceased to exist. The Middle Ages were ended; the Renaissance was beginning. The universal unity both of church and of empire was dissolved; the empire was now Germanic, and derived its principal strength from direct dominion over a few provinces. Independent -and national states were already formed or forming on all sides. The papacy itself had ceased to claim universal supremacy over the world’s Governments, and the possession of a temporal state had become essential to its existence. In fact Martin V. was the first of the series of popes who were real sovereigns, and more occupied with politics than religion. Involved in all the foreign intrigues, falsehoods, and treacheries of Italian diplomacy in the 15th century, their internal policy was imbued with all the arts practised by the tyrants of the Renaissance, and nepotism became necessarily the basis of their strength. It was natural that men suddenly elected sovereigns of a new country where they had no ties, and of which they had often no knowledge, should seek to strengthen their position by aggrandizing so-called nephews who were not Unfrequently their sons.

Martin V. reduced the remains of the free Roman ' Government to a mere civil municipality. Following the method of the other despots of Italy, the old republican institutions were allowed to retain their names and forms, their administrative and some of their judicial attributes, while all their political functions were transferred to the new Government. Order was re-established, and justice rigidly observed. Many rebellious places were subdued by the sword, and many leaders of armed bands were hanged. The pope, however, was forced to lean on his kinsmen the Colonna and again raise them to power by grants of vast fiefs both in his own state and the Neapolitan territory. And, after first supporting Joanna II., who had assisted his entry into Rome, he next sided with her adversary, Louis of Anjou, and then with Alphonso of Aragon, the conqueror of both and the constant friend of the pope, who at last felt safe on his throne. Rome now enjoyed order, peace, and security, but had lost all hope of liberty. And when Martin died (20th February 1431) these words were inscribed on his tomb, Temporum suorum félicitas.

Eugenius IV. (1431-47) leant on the Orsini, and was fiercely opposed by the Colonna, who excited the people against him. Accordingly on the 29th May 1434 the Romans rose in revolt to the old cry of “Popolo e popolo,” and again constituted the rule of the seven governors of liberty. The pope fled by boat down the Tiber, and, being pursued with stones and shots, narrowly escaped with his life. On reaching Florence, he turned his energies to the recovery of the state. It was necessary to quell the people; but, first of all, the Colonna and the clan of the prefects of Vico, with their renewed princely power, had to be overthrown. The Orsini were still his friends. Eugenius entrusted the campaign to Patriarch (afterwards Cardinal) Vitelleschi, a worthy successor of Albornoz, and of greater ferocity if less talent. This leader marched his army towards Rome, and, instantly attacking Giovanni, prefect of Vico, captured and beheaded him. The family was now extinguished; and, its possessions reverting to the church, the greater part of them were sold or given to Count Everso d’Anguillara, of the house of Orsini. The prefecture, now little more than an honorary title, was bestowed at will by the popes. Eugenius gave it to Francesco, founder of the powerful line of the Gravina-Orsini. Thus one noble family was raised to greatness while another perished by the sword. Vitelleschi had already begun to persecute the Colonna and the Savelli, and committed terrible slaughter among them. Many castles were demolished, many towns destroyed; and their inhabitants, driven to wander famine-stricken over the Campagna, had to sell themselves as slaves for the sake of bread. Finally the arrogant patriarch marched into Rome, as into a conquered city, at the head of his men, and the Romans crouched at his feet. The pope now began to distrust him, and sent Scarampo, another prelate of the same stamp, to take his place. This new commander soon arrived, and, perceiving that Vitelleschi proposed to resist, had him surrounded by his soldiers, who were obliged to use force to compel his surrender. ATtelleschi was carried bleeding to Castle St Angelo, where he soon afterwards died. The pope at last returned to Rome in 1443, and remained there quietly till his death in 1447.
[9:20:806]

His successor Nicholas V. (1447-55) was a scholar solely devoted to the patronage of literati and artists. During his reign there was a fresh attempt to restore the republic, but it was rather prompted by literary and classical enthusiasm than by any genuine patriotic ardour. Political passions and interests had ceased to exist. The conspiracy was headed by Stefano Porcari, a man of the f people, who claimed to be descended from Cato. He had once been captain of the people in Florence, and was made podestà of Bologna by Eugenius IV. He was a caricature of Cola di Rienzo, and extravagantly proud of his Latin speeches in honour of ancient republican liberty. The admiration of antiquity was then at its height, and Porcari found many enthusiastic hearers. Directly after the death of Eugenius IV. he made a first and unsuccessful attempt to proclaim the republic. Nevertheless Nicholas V., with the same indulgence for scholars that had prompted him to pardon Valla for denying the temporal power of the papacy and laughing to scorn the pretended donation of Constantine, freely pardoned Porcari and named him podestà of Anagni. He filled this office with credit, but on his return to Rome again began to play the agitator, and was banished to Bologna with a pension from the pope. Nicholas V. had conferred all the state offices upon priests and abbots, and had erected numerous fortresses. Hence there were many malcontents in Rome, in communication with Porcari at Bologna, and ready to join in his plot. Arms were collected, and on the day fixed he presented himself to his fellow-conspirators adorned with rich robes and a gold chain, and harangued them in Latin on the duty of freeing their country from the yoke of the priests. His design was to set fire to the Vatican on the 6th January 1453, the feast of the Epiphany; he and his followers were to seize the pope, the cardinals, and Castle St Angelo. But Nicholas received timely warning; the conspirators’ house was surrounded; and Porcari himself was seized while trying to escape, confined in Castle St Angelo, and put to death with nine of his companions on the 9th January. Others shortly suffered the same fate.

Under Calixtus III. and Pius II. affairs went on quietly enough, but Paul II. (1464-71) had a somewhat troubled reign. Yet he was a skilled politician. He reordered the finances and the courts of justice, punished crime with severity, was an energetic foe to the Malatesta of Rimini, put an end to the oppression exercised in Rome by the wealthy and arrogant house of Anguillara, and kept the people in good humour with continual festivities. But—and this was a grave defect at that period—he extended no favour to learning, and, by driving many scholars from the curia to make room for his own kinsmen, brought a storm about his ears. At that time the house of Pomponio Leto was the rendezvous of learned men and the seat of the Roman Academy. Leto was an enthusiast of antiquity; and, as the members of the Academy all assumed old Latin names, they were suspected of a design to re-establish paganism and the republican government. It is certain that they all inveighed against the pope; and, as the latter was no man of half measures, during the carnival of 1468 he suddenly imprisoned twenty Academicians, and even subjected a few of them to torture. Pomponio Leto, although absent in Venice, was also arrested and tried; but he exculpated himself, craved forgiveness, and was set at liberty. His friends were also released, for the charge of conspiracy proved to be unfounded. Certain members of the Academy, and notably Platina in his Lives of the Popes, afterwards revenged themselves by stigmatizing Paul II. as the persecutor of philosophy and letters. But he was no more a persecutor than a patron of learning; he was a politician, the author of some useful reforms, and solely intent on the consolidation of his absolute power. Among his reforms may be classed the revision of the Roman statutes in 1469, for the purpose of destroying the substance while preserving the form of the old Roman legislation, and entirely stripping it of all political significance. In fact the pope’s will was now absolute, and even in criminal cases he could trample unhindered on the common law.

There was still a senator of Rome, whose nomination was entirely in the hands of the pope, still three conservators, the heads of the rioni, and an elected council of twenty-six citizens. Now and then also a shadowy semblance of a popular assembly was held to cast dust in the eyes of the public, but even this was not for long. All these officials, together with the judges of the Capitol, retained various attributes of different kinds. They administered justice and gave sentence. There were numerous tribunals all with undefined modes of procedure, so that it was very difficult for the citizens to ascertain in which court justice should be sought. But in last resort there was always the supreme decision of the pope. Thus matters remained to the time of the French Revolution.

For the completion of this system a final blow had to be dealt to the aristocracy, whose power had been increased by nepotism; and it was dealt by bloodshed under the three following popes—Sixtus IV. (1471-84), Innocent VIIL (1484-92), and Alexander VI. (1492-1503)—each of whom was worse than his predecessor. The first, by means of his nephews, continued the slaughter of the Colonna, sending an army against them, devastating their estates at Alarino, and beheading the protonotary Lorenzo Colonna. Innocent VIII. was confronted by the power of the Orsini, who so greatly endangered his life by their disturbances in the city that he was only saved by an alliance with Naples. Neither peace nor order could be lastingly established until these arrogant barons were overthrown. This task was accomplished by the worst of the three pontiffs, Alexander VI. All know how the massacre of the Orsini was compassed, almost simultaneously, by the pope in Rome and his equally iniquitous son, Caesar Borgia, at Sinigaglia (1502). This pair dealt the last blow to the Roman aristocracy and the tyrants of Romagna, and thus the temporal dominion of the papacy was finally assured. The republic was now at an end; it had shrivelled to a civil municipality. Its institutions, deprived of all practical value, lingered on like ghosts of the past, subject from century to century to unimportant changes. The history of Rome is henceforth absorbed in that of the papacy.

Nevertheless the republic twice attempted to rise from its grave, and on the second occasion gave proofs of heroism worthy of its past. It was first resuscitated in February 1798, by the influence of the French Revolution, and the French constitution of the year III. was rapidly imitated. Rome had again two councils—the tribunate and the senate, with five consuls constituting the executive power. But in the following year, owing to the military reverses of the French, the government of the popes was restored until 1809, when Napoleon I. annexed to his empire the States of the Church. Rome was then governed by a consulta Straordinaria—a special commission—with the municipal and provincial institutions of France. In 1814 the papal government was again reinstated, and the old institutions, somewhat modified on the French system, were recalled to life. Pius IX. (1846-77) tried to introduce fresh reforms, and to improve and simplify the old machinery of state; but the advancing tide of the Italian revolution of 1848 drove him from Rome; the republic was once more proclaimed, and had a brief but glorious existence. Its programme was dictated by Joseph AIazzini, who with Saffi and Armellini formed the triumvirate at the head of the Government. United Italy was to be a [9:20:807]republic with Rome for her capital. The rhetorical idea of Cola di Rienzo became heroic in 1849. The constituent assembly (9th February 1849) proclaimed the fall of the temporal power of the popes, and the establishment of a republic which was to be not only of Rome but of all Italy. France, although then herself a republic, assumed the unenviable task of re-establishing the temporal power by force of arms. But the gallant defence of Rome by General Garibaldi covered the republic with glory. The enemy was repulsed, and the army of the Neapolitan king, sent to restore the pope, was also driven off. Then, however, France despatched a fresh and more powerful force; Rome was vigorously besieged, and at last compelled to surrender. AVith June 1849 begins the new series of pontifical laws designed to restore the government of Pius IX., whose reign down to 1870 was that of an absolute sovereign. Then the Italian Government entered Rome (20th September 1870), proclaimed the national constitution (9th October 1870), and the Eternal City became the capital of Italy. Thus the scheme of national unity, the natural outcome of the history of Rome and of Italy, impossible of accomplishment under the rule of the popes, was finally achieved by the monarchy of Savoy, which, as the true representative and personification of Italian interests, has abolished the temporal power of the papacy and made Rome the seat of government of the united country.

PART II.—TOPOGRAPHY AND ARCHAeOLOGY.

Rome ^[546.] is situated (41° 53' 52" N. Iat., 12° 28' 40" E. long.) on the banks of the Tiber, Italy, 14 miles from its present mouth, in a great plain of alluvial and marine deposit, broken into elevations by numerous masses of volcanic matter. The nine or ten hills and ridges on which the city stands are formed of masses of tufa or conglomerated sand and ashes thrown out by neighbouring volcanoes now extinct, but active down to a very recent period. One group of these volcanoes is that around Lago Bracciano, while another, still nearer to Rome, composes the Alban Hills. That some at least of these craters have been in a state of activity at no very distant period has been shown by the discovery at many places of broken pottery and bronze implements below the strata of tufa or other volcanic deposits. Traces of human life have even been found below that great flood of lava which, issuing from the Alban Hills, flowed towards the site of Rome, only stopping about 3 miles short, by the tomb of Cecilia Metella.

The superficial strata on which Rome is built are of three main kinds: (1) the plains and valleys on the left bank of the Tiber are covered, as it were, by a sea of alluvial deposit, in the midst of which (2) the hills of volcanic origin rise like so many islands; and (3) on the right bank of the Tiber, around the Janiculan and Vatican Hills, are extensive remains of an ancient sea-beach, conspicuous in parts by its fine golden sand and its deposits of greyish white potter’s clay. From its yellow sand the Janiculan has been sometimes known as the Golden Hill, a name which survives in the church on its summit called S. Pietro in Montorio (Monte d’Oro). In addition to these three chief deposits, at a few places, especially in the Aventine and Pincian Hills, under-strata of travertine crop out—a hard limestone rock, once in solution in running water, and deposited gradually as the water lost its carbonic-acid solvent, a process still rapidly going on at Terni, Tivoli, and other places in the neighbourhood. The conditions under which the tufa hills were formed have been very various, as is clearly seen by an examination of the rock at different places. The volcanic ashes and sand of which the tufa is composed appear in parts to lie just as they were showered down from the crater; in that case it shows but little sign of stratification, and consists wholly of igneous products. In parts time and pressure have bound together these scoriae into a soft and friable rock; in other places they still lie in loose sandy beds and can be dug out with the spade. Other masses of tufa again show signs either of having been deposited in water, or else washed away from their first resting-place and redeposited with visible stratifications; this is shown by the water-worn pebbles and chips of limestone rock, which form a conglomerate bound together by the volcanic ashes into a sort of natural cement. A third variety is that which exists on the Palatine Hill. Here the shower of red-hot ashes has evidently fallen on a thickly-growin forest, and the burning wood, partly smothered by the ashes, has been converted into charcoal, large masses of which are embedded in the tufa rock. In some places charred branches of trees, their form well preserved, can be easily distinguished. The so-called “wall of Romulus” is built of this conglomerate of tufa and charred wood; a very perfect section of the branch of a tree is visible onone of the blocks by the Scalae Caci.

So great have been the physical changes in the site of Rome since the first dawn of the historic period that it is difficult now to realize what its aspect once was. The Forum Romanum, the Velabrum, the great Campus Martius (now the most crowded part of modern Rome), and other valleys were once almost impassable marshes or pools of water (0v., Fast., vi. 401; Dionys., ii. 50). The draining of these valleys was effected by means of the great cloacae, which were among the earliest important architectural works of Rome (Vaιτo, Ling. Lat., iv. 149). Again, the various hills and ridges were once more numerous and very much more abrupt than they are now. At an early period, when each hill was crowned by a separate village fort, the great object of the inhabitants was to increase the steepness of its cliffs and render access difficult. At a later time, when Rome was united under one government, the very physical peculiarities which had originally made its hills so populous, through their natural adaptability for defence, became extremely inconvenient in a united city, where architectural symmetry and splendour were above all things aimed at. Hence the most gigantic engineering works were undertaken: tops of hills were levelled, whole ridges cut away, and gentle slopes formed in the place of abrupt cliffs. The levelling of the Velia and the excavation of the site for Trajan’s forum are instances of this. The same works were continued in the Middle Ages, as when in the 14th century an access was made to the Capitoline Arx ^[547.] from the side of the Campus Martius; up to that time a steep cliff had prevented all approach except from the side of the Forum.
[9:20:808]

And under the present Government an even more extensive plan, called the “piano regolatore,” is being (1886) gradually carried out, with the object of reducing hills and valleys to one uniform level, on which wide boulevards are being constructed on the chessboard plan of an American city. The constant fires which have devastated Rome have been a great agent in obliterating the natural contour of the ground. The accumulated rubbish from these and other causes has in some places covered the ground to the depth of 40 feet, especially in the valleys.

The climate of Rome in ancient times appeal's to have been colder than it is at present. Malarious fever in and around the city existed to some extent, but to a much less degree than it does now. The magnificent villa of Hadrian and other country houses near Rome are built on sites which are now very unhealthy. The sanitary superiority of the Campagna in ancient times was mainly due to its more complete drainage and thicker population. That fever did exist is, however, proved in many ways. Altars to the goddess Febris were erected on the Palatine and other hills, and on the Esquiline was a grove dedicated to Mephitis. The population of Rome ^[548. Monografie, di Roma,] increased with great rapidity, till, during its most populous period in the 4th century, it was probably not less than 2⅛ millions. ^[549.

Pont. d. Lined,] Ancient Rome. Architecture and Construction.

The chief building materials used in ancient Rome were those enumerated below. (1) 2 , w∕α, the “ruber et niger tophus” of Vitruvius (ii. 7), the formation of which has been described above, is usually a warm brown or yellow colour. The Aventine, Palatine, and Capitoline Hills contained quarries of the tufa, much worked at an early period (see Liv., xxvi. 27, xxxix. 44, and Varro, A.Z., iv. 151). It is a very bad “weather-stone,” but stands well if protected with stucco (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 48). (2) Lapis Albanus, from Alba Longa, is also of volcanic origin, a conglomerate of ashes, gravel, and fragments of stone; its quarries are still worked at Albano and Marino. (3) Lapis Gabinus, from Gabii, is very similar to the last, but harder and a better weather-stone; it contains large lumps of broken lava, products of an earlier eruption, and small pieces of limestone. According to Tacitus [Ann., xv. 43), it is fire-proof, and this is also the case with the Alban stone. Both are now called peperino, from the black scoriae, like peppercorns, with which the brown conglomerate mass is studded. (4) Silex (mod. selce), a lava from the now extinct volcanoes in the Alban Hills, was used for paving roads, and when broken into small pieces and mixed with lime and pozzolana formed an immensely durable concrete. It is dark grey, very hard, and breaks with a slightly conchoidal fracture (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 29; Vitr., ii. 7), but does not resemble what is now called silex or flint. (5) Lapis Tiburtimis (travertine), the chief quarries of which are at Tibur (Tivoli) and other places along the river Anio, is a hard pure carbonate of lime, of a creamy white colour, deposited from running or dripping water in a highly stratified form, with frequent cavities and fissures lined with crystals. As Vitruvius (ii. 5) says, it is a good weather-stone, but is soon calcined by fire. If laid horizontally it is very strong, but if set on end its crystalline structure is a great source of weakness, and it splits from end to end. Neglect on the part of Roman builders of this important precaution in many cases caused a complete failure in the structure. This was notably the case in the rostra (see below). (6) Pulvis Ruteo-lanus (pozzolana), so called from extensive beds of it at Puteoli, is a volcanic product, which looks like red sandy earth, and lies in enormous beds under and round the city of Rome. When mixed with lime it forms a very strong hydraulic cement, of equal use in concrete, mortar, or undercoats of stucco. It is to this material that the concrete walls of Rome owe their enormous strength and durability, in many cases far exceeding those of the most massive stone masonry. Vitruvius devotes a chapter (bk. ii. ch. 6) to this very important material.

Bricks were either sun-dried or kiln-baked [lateres crιιdi aui cοcti). The remarks of Vitruvius (ii. 3) seem to refer wholly to sun-dried bricks, of which no examples now exist in Rome. It is very important to recognize the fact that among the existing ancient buildings of Rome there is no such thing as a brick wall or a brick arch in the true sense of the word; bricks were merely used as a facing to concrete walls and arches and have no constructional importance. Concrete [fartura, eaementum, or opus structurae caementitiae, Vitr., ii. 4, 6, 8), the most important of all the materials used, is made of rough pieces of stone or of fragments of brick, averaging from about the size of a man’s fist and embedded in cement made of lime and pozzolana,—forming one solid mass of enormous strength and coherence. Stucco, cement, and mortar [Iectorium, opus albarium, structura testacea, and other names) are of many kinds; the ancient Romans especially excelled in their manufacture. The cement used for lining the channels of aqueducts [opus signinum) was made of lime mixed with pounded brick or potsherds and pozzolana; the same mixture was used for floors under the “nucleus” or finer cement on which the mosaic or marble paving-slabs were bedded, and was called eaementum ex testis tunsis. For walls, three or four coats of stucco were used, often as much as 5 inches thick altogether; the lower coats were of lime and pozzolana, the finishing coats of powdered white marble [opus albarium) suitable to receive painting. Even marble buildings were usually coated with a thin layer of this fine white stucco, nearly as hard and durable as the marble itself—a practice also employed in the finest buildings of the Greeks—probably because it formed a more absorbent ground for coloured decoration; stone columns coated in this way λvere called “columnae dealbatae” (Cic., In Verr., ii. 1, 52 sq. ). For the kinds of sand used in mortar and stucco Vitruvius (ii. 4) mentions sea, pit, and river sand, saying that pit sand is to be preferred.

Marble appears to have come into use about the beginning of the 1st century B.c. Its introduction was at first viewed with great jealousy, as savouring of Greek luxury. The orator Crassus was the first to use it in his house on the Palatine, built about 92 b.c.; and, though he had only six small columns of Hymettian marble, he was for this luxury nicknamed the “Palatine Venus” by the stern republican M. Brutus (Plin., H. N, xxxvi. 3). The temporary wooden theatre of the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus, built in 58 b.c., appears to have been the first building in which marble was more largely used; its 360 columns and the lower order of its scena were of Greek marble (see Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 3, 24). In a very few years, under the rule of Augustus, marble became very common. ^[550. Αug., onus quadrature opus reticulatum eoηfessioηes Pietre antiche,]

Of white statuary marble four principal varieties were used. (1) Marmor Luncnse. from Luna, near the modern Carrara (Strabo, v.), is of many qualities, from the purest creamy white and the finest grain to the coarser sorts disfigured with bluish grey streaks. (Ex., the eleven Corinthian columns in the Dogana di Terra.) (2) Marmor Hymettium, from Mount Hymettus, near Athens, is coarser in grain than the best Luna marble and is usually marked with grey or blue striations (Strabo, x.). (Ex., the forty-two columns in the nave of S Maria Maggiore and the columns in S. Pietro in Vincoli.)

(3) Marmor Pentelicum, from Mount Pentelicus, also near Athens, is very fine in grain and of a pure white; it was more used for architectural purposes than for statues, though some sculptors preferred it above all others, especially Scopas and Praxiteles (Paus., Arcad., viii. ). (Ex., the bust of the young Augustus in the Vatican.)

(4) Marrnor Barium, from the Isle of Paros, is very beautiful, though coarse in texture, having a very crystalline structure.

Nine chief varieties of coloured marbles were used in Rome. (1) Marmor Numidieum (mod. giallo αηtico; Plin., H.N., v. 3), from Numidia and Libya, hence also called Libycum, is of a rich yellow, deepening to orange and even pink. Enormous quantities of it were used, especially for columns, wall-linings, and pavements. (Ex., six large columns in the Pantheon and seven on the arch of Constantine, taken from the arch of Trajan; the eighth column is in the Lateran basilica.) (2) Marmor Carystium (mod. Cipollino), from Carystus in Eubcea (Strabo, x.), has alternate wavy strata of white and pale green—the “undosa Carystos” of Statius [Silν. , i. 5, 36). From its well-defined layers like an onion [cipolla) is derived its modern name. (Ex., columns of temple of Faustina. ) (3) Marrnor Phrygium or SynnadiCUm (mod. pavonazetto), from Synnada in Phrygia (Strabo, xii.; Juv., xiv. 307; Tibull., iii. 3, 13), is a slightly translucent marble, with rich purple markings, violet verging on red. It was fabled to be stained with the blood of Atys (Stat., Silv., i. 5, 36). (Ex., twelve fluted columns in S. Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, and large columns in the apse of S. Paolo fuori, saved from the ancient nave of the basilica, burnt in 1823.) (4) Marrnor Iasium (probably the modern porta Santa), from Iasus, is mottled with large patches of dull red, olive green, and white. The “holy door” of St Peter’s is framed with it, hence its modern name. (Ex., the slabs in front of the Gracostasisand four columns in S. Agnese fuori Ie Mura. ) (5) Marmor Chium (probably the modern Afrieano), from Chios, is similar in colour and marking to the porta santa, but more brilliant in tint. (Ex., a great part of the paving of the Basilica Julia and two large columns in the centre of the façade of St Peter’s.) (6) Rosso antico (the ancient name is unknown) is a very close-grained marble of a rich deep red, like blood. As a rule it does not occur in large nieces, but was much used for [9:20:809]small cornices and other mouldings in interiors of buildings. Its quarries in Greece are still worked. (The largest pieces known are the fourteen steps to the high altar of S. Prassede and two columns nearly 12 feet high in the Rospigliosi Casino dell’Aurora. ) (7)

Nero antico is probably the ancient manner Taenarium, from Cape Taenarus in Sparta. It is mentioned by Tibullus (iii. 3, 14) in conjunction with Phrygian and Carystian marbles; see also Prop., iii. 2, and Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 43. (Ex., two columns in the choir of the church of Ara Cceli.) (8) Lapis Atraeius {verde antieο), found at Atrax in Thessaly (Liv., xxxii. 15), was one of the favourite materials for decorative architecture; it is not strictly a marble (i,e., a calcareous stone) but a variety of “precious serpentine,” with patches of white and brown on a brilliant green ground. It seldom occurs in large masses. (The finest known specimens are the twenty-four columns beside the niches in the nave of the Lateran basilica.) (9) The hard Oriental alabaster, the “onyx” or “alabastrites” of Pliny {H.N., xxxvi. 12, xxxvii. 32); its chief quarries were on the Nile near Thebes, ^[551.] in Arabia, and near Damascus. In Pliny’s age it was a great rarity; but in later times it was introduced in large quantities, and fragments of a great many columns have been found on the Palatine, in the baths of Caracalla, and elsewhere. It is semi-transparent, and beautifully marked with concentric nodules and wavy strata. An immense number of other less common marbles have been found, including many varieties of breccia, but their ancient names are unknown.

From the latter part of the 1st century b.c. hard stones—granites and basalts—were introduced in great quantities. The basalts— “basanites” of Pliny (xxxvi. 11)—are very refractory, and can only be worked by the help of emery or diamond dust. The former was obtained largely at Naxos; diamond-dust drills are mentioned by Pliny {H.N., xxxvii. 76). The basalts are black, green, and brown, and are usually free from spots or markings; examples of all three exist, but are comparatively rare. The red variety called “porphyry” was used in enormous quantities. It is the “porphyrites” of Pliny {H.N., xxxvi. 11), and was brought from Egypt. It has a rich red ground, covered with small specks of white felspar; hence it was also called “Ieptopsephos.” A large number of columns of it exist, and it was much used for pavements of opus Alexandrinum. A rich green porphyry or basalt was also largely used, but not in such great masses as the red porphyry. It has a brilliant green ground covered with rectangular light green crystals of felspar. This is the lapis Lacedxmoxiixis (wrongly called by the modern Romans “Serpentino ”), so named from its quarries in Mount Taygetus in Lacedaemonia (Paus., Lac., iii. and viii.; Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 11; Juv., xi. 173). It appears to have been mostly used for pavements and panels of wall linings. The granites used in Rome came mostly from near Phike on the Nile (Plin., Η.N., xxxvi. 13). The red sort was called lapis pyrrhopoecilus and the grey lapis psaronius. The columns in the Basilica Ulpia are a fine example of the latter; both sorts are used for the columns of the Pantheon and those of the temple of Saturn in the Forum. Gigantic ships were specially made to carry the obelisks and other great monoliths (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 1, 14).

The style of architecture employed in ancient Rome may be said to have passed through three stages,—the Etruscan, the Greek, and the Roman. During the first few centuries of the existence of the city, both the methods of construction and the designs employed appear to have been purely Etruscan. The earliest temples were either simple cellae without columns, as we see on the Palatine by the Scalae Caci, or else, in the case of the grander temples, such as that of Capitoline Jupiter, the columns were very widely spaced (araeostyle), and consequently had entablatures of wooden beams. The architectural decorations were more generally in gilt bronze or painted terra-cotta than in stone, and the paintings or statues which decorated the buildings were usually the work of Etruscan artists. ^[552. r τ] The Greek influence is more obvious; almost all the temples of the earlier imperial age are Greek, with certain modifications, not only in general design but in details and ornaments. Greek architects were largely employed; and Roman architects such as Vitruvius and C. Mutius in the 1st century b.c., Severus and Celer under Nero, and Rabirius under Domitian were Greek by education, and probably studied at Athens (see Vitr., vii., Praef.; Hirt, Gesch. d. Baukunst, ii. p. 257; Burn, Rome, p. 76). ^[553. a] The Romans, however, though quite devoid of artistic originality, were very able engineers, and this led to the development of a new and more purely Roman style, in which the restrictions imposed by the use of the stone lintel were put aside and large spaces were covered with vaults and domes cast in semifluid concrete, a method which had the enormous advantage of giving the arched form without the constant thrust at the springing which makes true arches or vaults of wide span so difficult to deal with. The enormous vaults of the great thermae, the basilica of Constantine, and the like cover their spaces with one solid mass like a metal lid, giving the form but not the principle of the arch, and thus allowing the vault to be set on walls which would at once have been thrust apart had they been subjected to the immense leverage which a true arched vault constantly exerts on its imposts. ^[554. (F Art de bâtir chez les Romains,] This is a very important point, and one which is usually overlooked, mainly owing to the Roman practice of facing their concrete with bricks, which (from an examination of the surface only) appear to be a principal item in the construction. The walls of the Pantheon, for example, are covered with tiers of brick arches, and many theories have been invented as to their use in distributing the weight of the walls. But a recognition of the fact that these walls are of concrete about 20 feet thick, while the brick facing averages scarcely 6 inches in thickness, clearly shows that these ‘ ‘ relieving arches” have no more constructional use as far as concerns the pressure than if they were painted on the surface of the walls. Exactly the same reasons apply to the superficial use of brick in all arches and vaults.

At first tufa only was used in opus quadratum, as we see in the so-called wall of Romulus. Next the harder peperino began to be worked: it is used, though sparingly, in the great Servian wall, and during the later republic appears to have been largely employed for exterior walls or points where there was heavy pressure, while other parts were built of tufa. Thirdly, travertine appears to have been introduced about the 2d century B. c., but was used at first for merely ornamental purposes, very much as marble was under the empire; after about the middle of the 1st century a.d. travertine began to be largely used for the solid mass of walls, as in the temple of Vespasian and the

Colosseum. The tufa or peperino blocks were roughly 2 (Ro man) feet thick in regular courses, iso- domum, by 2 feet across the end, and under the republic often exactly 4 feet long, so that two blocks set endways ranged with one set lengthways. They were then arranged in alternate courses of headers and stretchers, so as to make a good bond; this is the ‘ ‘ em-

plecton” of Vitruvius

(ii. 8). The so-called

Tabularium of the

Capitol is a good example of this (see fig. 1). The harder and more valuable travertine was not cut in this regular way, but pieces of all sizes were used, just as they happened to come from the quarry, in order to avoid waste: blocks as much as 15 by 8 feet were used, and the courses varied in thickness—the “pseudispdomuπι” of Vitruvius. When tufa or peperino was mixed with' the travertine, it was cut so as to range with the irregular courses of the latter.

It is an interesting point to note the manner in which the Roman builders mixed their different materials according to the weight they had to carry. While tufa was frequently used for the main walls, peperino {e.g., in the Servian wall on the Aventine) or travertine {e.g., in the forum of Augustus and the temple of Fortuna Virilis, so called) was inserted at points of special pressure, such as piers or arches (see fig. 21 below). The Colosseum is a particularly elaborate example of this mixed construction with three degrees of pressure supported by three different materials (see fig. 2). __ [9:20:810]The use of mortar with opus quadratum is a sign of an early rather than a late date. ^[555. (U Art de bâtir chez les Romains,] It occurs in the Servian wall on the Aventine, in the

Tabularium,and, most striking of all, in the Tul-Iianum under the u Mamertine prison” — certainly one of the oldest buildings in Rome (see fig.

11). Under the empire massive blocks, whether of tufa, travertine, or marble, are set without any mortar. It must, however, be observed that in these early instances the “mortar” is but a thin stratum of lime, little thicker than stout paper, used not as a cement to bind the blocks together, but simply to give the joints a smoothly fitting surface. The actual binding together was done by clamps and dowels, as well as by the mass and weight of the great blocks used. Except in the earliest masonry, each block was

Verycarefully fastened, not only to the next blocks on the same course, which was done with double dove-tailed dowels of wood, but also to those above and below with stout iron clamps, run with lead (Vitr., ii. 8). ^[556.] In more ornamental marble work bronze clamps were often used.

When concrete was employed it was faced either with blocks of opus quadratum (e.g., the Servian wall along the Aventine) or with opus incertum—small irregularly shaped blocks of tufa 3 to 6 inches across, with pointed ends driven into the concrete while it was soft, and worked smooth on the face only (see fig. 3). Thirdly, in the 1st century b.c. opus reticulatum, ^[557.] also of tufa, was largely used alone; after that it began to be mixed with brickwork. It is very neat in appearance, and is often fitted with great care, though it was generally covered with stucco. The so-called “house of Livia” on the Palatine is a good example of the earlier sort, when the quoins were made of small rectangular blocks of tufa.

The palace of Caligula has it with quoins of brick facing. Though in Rome opus reticulatum was always made of tufa, in the neighbourhood of the city it was sometimes of peperino or even lava, where these materials were found on the spot.

Of concrete walls faced with burnt bricks no dated example 1 earlier than the middle of the 1st century n.c. is known. Thei Pantheon (27 b.c. ) is the most important early specimen of certain date. The bricks used are always triangular in shape, so as to present a large surface on the face with little expenditure of brick, and also to improve the bond with the concrete behind (see fig. 4). Even party walls of small rooms, only 7 inches thick, are not built solid, but have a concrete core faced with brick triangles about 3 inches long. Owing to this method of forming the walls it was necessarily to support the facing until the concrete was set, which appears to have been done with a λvooden framing covered with planks on the inside.

In some cases the planks were nailed outside the wooden uprights, as was done with the unfaced concrete walls (see below), and then a series of perpendicular grooves appear in the face of the brickwork. Walls faced with opus reticulatum must have been supported temporarily in the same way.

The character of the brick facing is a great help towards determining the date of Roman buildings; it has been stated that this can be done simply by measuring the number of brick courses that go to a foot,—the more the bricks the earlier the work. This, however, is not the case. In early work the bricks are thick and the joints thin, while in later times the reverse is the case. Thus brickwork of the time of Severus and later usually has more bricks to the foot than that of the Flavian period. The following list gives a few characteristic specimens of different dates.

The length of the bricks as it appears on the face is no guide to the date, owing to the fact that one or more of the sharp points of the brick triangles were very frequently broken off before they were used. Moreover, varieties both in quality of workmanship and size of the bricks often occur in work of the same date; a new gang of workmen oι , a batch of bricks from a fresh figlina might easily occasion this. In the remains of Nero’s Golden House great varieties appear, and some of the walls in the inferior rooms are faced with very irregular and careless brickwork. ^[558.] Special care and neatness were always employed in the rare cases when the wall was not to be covered with stucco, which in the absence of marble was usually spread over both inside and outside walls. All these circumstances make great caution necessary in judging of dates; fortunately after the 1st centuryA.D., and in some cases even earlier, stamps impressed on bricks, and especially on the largo tiles used for arches, give clearer indications. The reason of tlιo almost universal use of smooth facings either of opus reticulatum or of brick over concrete walls is a very puzzling question; for concrete itself forms an excellent ground for the stucco coating or backing to the marble slabs, while the stucco adheres with difficulty to a smooth facing, and is very liable to fall away. The modern practice of raking out the joints to form a key was not employed by the Romans, but before the mortar was hard they studded the face of the wall with marble plugs and iron or bronze nails driven into the joints, so as to give a hold for the stucco—a great waste both of labour and material. ^[559. Ann. Inst.,] The quality of the mortar varies according to its date: during the 1st and 2d centuries it is of most remarkable hardness,—made of lime with a mixture of coarse pozzolana of a bright red colour; in the 3d century it began to be inferior in quality; and the pozzolana used under the later empire is brown instead of red.

Concrete was at first always made of lumps of tufa; then travertine, lava, broken bricks, and even marble were used, in fact all the chips and fragments of the mason’s yard. Under the empire the concrete used was of travertine or lava mostly for foundations, of tufa or broken bricks for walls, and of tufa or pumice-stone (for the sake of lightness) for vaults. Massive walls were cast in a “reticulatum, quo nunc [reign of Augustus] omnes utuntur, et antiquum, quod incertum dicitur.” I [9:20:811]mould; upright timbers, about 6 by 7 inches thick and 10 to 14 feet long, were set in rows on each face of the future wall; planks 9 to 10 inches wide were nailed to them, so as to form two sides of a sort of box, into which the semi-fluid mass of stones, lime, and pozzolana was poured. When this was set the timbers were removed and refixed on the top of the concrete wall; then fresh concrete was poured in; and this process was repeated till the wall was raised to the required height. Usually such cast-work was only used for foundations and cellar walls, the upper parts being faced with brick; but in some cases the whole wall to the top was cast in this way and the brick facing omitted. In strength and durability no masonry, however hard the stone or large the blocks, could ever equal these walls of concrete when made with hard lava or travertine, for each wall was one perfectly coherent mass, and could only be destroyed by a laborious process like that of quarrying hard stone from its native bed. Owing to this method of forming the Roman buildings the progress of the work from day to day can often be traced by a change in the look of the concrete. About 3 feet high appears to have been the average amount of wall raised in a day.

Marble linings were fixed very firmly to the walls with long clamps of metal, hooked at the end so as to hold in a hole made in the marble slab. Fig. 5 gives an example, of the time of Augustus, fixed against a stone wall.

The quantity of rich marbles which, for at least three centuries, were being dug out in countless quarries in the East, by whole armies of workmen, and constantly poured into Rome is almost beyond calculation.

Scarcely a church is without columns and wall - linings stolen from ancient buildings, and the more magnificent chapels, such as those of the Borghese, Corsini, and Cibo families, with the whole church of S. Maria della Vittoria, owe their splendour entirely to their wall-linings of ancient marbles, porphyry, and alabaster. ^[560. l] The blocks were usually marked in the quarry with a number, and often with the names of the reigning emperor and the overseer of the quarry. These quarry-marks are often of great value as indications of the date of a building or statue. ^[561. Ann. Inst.,] Metropolitan building Acts, not unlike those of modern London, were enacted by several of the emperors. These fixed the materials to be used, the thickness of walls, the minimum width of streets, the maximum height allowed for houses, and the like. After the great fire in Nero’s reign, 64 a,d., an Act was passed requiring external walls to be faced with fire-proof materials, such as peperino or burnt brick; this Act was being prepared long before the fire,—strong evidence as to this being a wilful act on Nero’s part, as is asserted by Suetonius (Kero, 38).

t Enormous accumulations of statues and pictures enriched Rome >f during its period of greatest splendour. In the first place, the numerous statues of the republican and even of the regal period were religiously preserved at a time when, from their archaic character, they must have been regarded rather as objects of sacred or archaeological interest than as works of art (Plin., H.K, xxxiv. 9-16, XXXV. 7). Secondly came the large Graeco-Roman class, mostly copies of earlier Greek works, executed in Rome by Greek artists. To this class belongs most of the finest existing sculpture preserved in the Vatican and other museums. Thirdly, countless statues and pictures were stolen from almost every important city in Greece, Magna Graecia, Sicily, and western Asia Minor. These robberies began early, and were carried on for many centuries. The importations included works of art by all the chief artists from the 5th century downwards. Long lists are given by Pliny (H.K., xxxiii.-xxxvi. ), and pedestals even now exist with the names of Praxiteles, Timarchus, Polycletus, Bryaxis, and others (see Bull. Comm. Arch. Rom., ii. p. 176). These accumulated works of sculpture were of all materials—gold and ivory (Suet., Tit., 2), of which seventy-four are mentioned in the catalogue of the Breviarium (see Preller, Regionen, p. 231), many hundreds or even thousands of silver ^[562. M on. Ancyr.] (!Tin., H.K., xxxiii. 54), while those of gilt bronze and marble must Iiave existed in almost untold numbers (Paus., viii. 46). Nor were the accumulated stores of Greek paintings much inferior in number; not only were easel pictures by Zeuxis, Apelles, Timanthes, and other Greek artists taken, but even mural paintings were carefully cut off , their walls and brought to Rome secured in wooden frames (Plin., H.K., XXXV. 49, and compare ibid., 45).

The basalt (silex) roads were made of polygonal blocks of lava neatly fitted together and laid on a carefully prepared bed, similar to that used for mosaic paving (see Mosaic and Roads). Roads thus made were called “viae stratae.” One portion only exists in Rome of early date, when the blocks were fitted together with the utmost accuracy viz., a piece of the Clivus Capitolinus in front of the temple of Saturn (see fig. 6, which also shows the massive travertine curb which bordered the road; in some cases the curb was of lava). The other best preserved viae stratae in Rome are those leading up to the Palatine from the Summa Sacra Via and that which follows the curved line of shops in Trajan’s forum. Many others exist, but have all been relaid in later times, with badly fitting joints. ^[563. Vie degli Antichi,]

The following is a list of the chief roads which radiated from Rome (see Plate VI.):—(1) Via Appia and (2) Via Latina, both issued from the Servian Porta Capena, and both met at Beneventum; (3) Via Labicana, from the P. Esquilina, passing Labicum, joined the Via Latina 30 miles from Rome; (4) Via Gabina (later called Praenestina), also issued from the P. Esquilina and joined the Via Latina,—these two roads pass through the Claudian aqueduct gate (mod. Porta Maggiore); (5) Via Tiburtina, from the gate of that name to Tibur; (6) Via Nomentana, from the P. Collina, passing Nomen-tum, joined the Via Salaria; (7) Via Salaria, also from the P. Collina, joined the Via Flaminia at Ancona; (8) Via Flaminia, its first half-mile or so after leaving the Servian Porta Ratumena was known as the Via Lata; it afterwards passed out of the Aurelian P. Flaminia, and with many branches led to the chief towns of Northern Italy, and so into Cisalpine Gaul; (9) Via Aurelia, issued from the trans-Tiberine P. Aurelia and passed through Pisa to Gaul; (10) Via Portuensis, from the gate of that name, also on the right hank of the Tiber, to Portus Augusti near its mouth; (11) Via Ostiensis, from the Servian P. Trigemina and the Aurelian P. Ostiensis to Ostia; (12) Via Ardeatina, probably a branch from the Via Appia, led to Ardea.

Remains of Prehistoric Rome.

It is evident from recent discoveries that the site of Rome was populous at a very remote period. Flint implements and remains of the early Bronze Age have been found on the Aventine and in other places; ^[564.] and in 1874, near the arch of Gallienus on the Esquiline, the important discovery was made of a necropolis ^[565. Ann. Inst., sq., Mon. Inst., Βull. Comm. Arch.,] apparently of considerable extent, the tombs of which and their contents—fictile vases and other objects—were of Phoenician and Etruscan character, dating probably about the time of the traditional founding of Rome. In February 1883 a number of very early cist tombs, formed by two slabs of stone set on edge with a third for the lid, were found during excavations on the Esquiline between the Piazza Vitt. Emmanuele and the Via di Napoleone [9:20:812]III. ^[566. Not. degli Scavi, Ann. Inst.,] Some of the pottery found in the Esquiline necropolis was of that rare kind which is coated with white and coloured stanniferous enamels, examples of which have been found in Aegina and at Camirus in Rhodes,—a method of decoration which is not Hellenic, but was common in Assyria and Egypt. ^[567. Pitture e Sepolcri sull’ Esquilino, Ogetti arcaici rinvenuti nel Viminale,] Some of the Esquiline tombs also contained terra-cotta reliefs of Oriental character, covered with plumbo-vitreous glaze, coloured brilliant blues and greens, like the little figures so commonly found in Egypt. Some dim traditions of these earlier inhabitants certainly existed among the Romans: Dion Cassius (iii. 5), to account for the existence of a city on the Palatine earlier than the traditional Roma Quadrata, invents an earlier Romulus and Remus to be its founders. ^[568. Handb. der röm. Alterth.,]

The most important existing relics of the time when Roman history first begins, though dimly, to take a definite shape are the so-called “wall of Romulus,” forming the circuit of the famous Roma Quadrata of the Palatine. Unfortunately the accounts of the extent of the Pomcerium Postmarvum') or sacred enclosure give but little help towards defining its circuit. Even its precise nature is a matter of doubt, in spite of the accounts of it given by Varro (Z.i., v. 143), Livy (i. 44), and Dionysius (i. 88), as is usually the case with descriptions in ancient writers of what was in their time purely an archaeological matter. It is, however, certain that the Pomoerium in some way or other followed the circuit of the primitive city, called from its shape Roma Quadrata. ^[569. Rom., 9.] Its boundaries are given thus by Tacitus {Ann., xii. 24): Startingfrom the Forum Boarium at the west corner of the Palatine, it goes to the Ara Maxima (see Hnιι. Inst., 1854, p. 28) and the Ara Consi, both probably in the Vallis Murciae, afterwards occupied by the Circus Maximus; but the exact positions of these points are unknown. ^[570. lt n i t0 e nsua ll a ,ar Rom., L. L., De Spec.,] The next stages are the Curiae Veteres, the Sacellum Laram, and lastly the Forum Romanum. Unfortunately the known points in this description, namely the two fora, are precisely those which mark that part of the circuit known from existing remains of the walls. It is therefore to the scanty relics of the wall which still exist on the other sides that we must turn to determine the extent of Roma Quadrata. These enable us to fix its line along the whole valley of the Velabrum, on the west of the hill, and along the valley of the Circus Maximus as far as the so-called Domus Gelo-tiana, about half-way on the south side (see fig. 17). The doubtful point has been whether the line of the wall from north to south included the whole extent of the hill, or passed across it, along the line of that deep natural valley which once divided the Palatine into two parts, and was in later times filled up and built upon by Domitian in the construction of his great palace. Recent excavations have, however, disclosed at several points the existence of this ancient wall extending along the south-eastern part of the Palatine; moreover, there is strong evidence as to Roma Quadrata being coextensive with the whole hill from Cicero, De Rep., ii. 6, and Aul. Gell., xiii. 14. Traces of the wall have been found running eastwards from the Porta Mugonia, and that piece of wall by the Domus Gelotiana which starts to run northwards across the middle of the hill has been found to be merely a projecting spur, which again turns eastwards, so as to include apparently the rest of the Palatine where the palace of Severus now stands.

The most perfect remains of the Romulean wall are those near the west angle of the hill (see fig. 7). These show that the fortifications of Roma Quadrata were formed in the usual manner of Etruscan cities, in which the natural strength given by cliffs was increased by artificial means. The wall was set neither at the top nor at the foot of the hill, but more than half-way up, a level terrace or shelf all round being cut in the rock on which the base of the wall stood. Above that the hill was cut away into a cliff, not quite perpendicular but slightly “battering” inwards, to give greater stability to the wall, which was built up against it, like a retaining wall, reaching to the top of the cliff, and probably a few feet higher. The stones used in this wall are soft tufa, a warm brown in colour, and full of masses of charred wood. The cutting to form the steep cliff probably supplied part of the material for the wall; and ancient quarries, afterwards used as reservoirs for water, exist in the mass of rock on which the so-called temple of Jupiter Victor stands. It has been asserted that these tufa blocks are not cut but split with wedges; this, however, is not the case. Tufa does not split into rectangular masses, but would be shattered to pieces by a wedge; moreover, distinct tool-marks can be seen on all the blocks whose surface is well preserved and in the quarries themselves. Chisels from one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch in width were used, and also a sharp-pointed pick or hammer. The wall is about 10 feet thick at the bottom, and increases in thickness above as the scarped cliff against which it is built recedes. It is built of blocks laid in alternate courses of headers and stretchers, varying in thickness from 22 to 24 inches, in length from 3 to 5 feet, and in width from

19 to 22 inches. These blocks are carefully worked on their beds, but the face is left rough, and the vertical joints are in some cases open, spaces of nearly 2

inches being left be tween block and block; in other cases the ver tical joints are worked true and close like the beds. The open vertical joints are peculiar to the masonry of this early period; in the wall of

Servius they always fit closely, at least on the visible face of the wall.

Nomortarwasused. At two points on the side of the Velabrum (see 8

and 9 on the plan of the

Palatine, fig. 17) wind ing passages are exca vated in the tufa cliff, the entrance to which was once closed by the ancient wall. One of these (No. 8) in early times (before water in abundance was brought to the Palatine on aqueducts) was used as a reservoir to collect surface water, probably for use in case of siege; circular shafts for buckets are cut downwards through the rock from the top of the hill; fig. 7 shows it in section. An exactly similar rock-cut cistern with vertical shafts, of very early date, exists at Alba Longa. Opposite the church of S. Teodoro a series of buttresses belonging to the wall of Romulus exists, partly concealed by a long line of buildings of the later years of the republic and the early empire, to make room for which the greater part of the then useless wall was pulled down, and only fragments left here and there, where they could be worked into the walls of the later houses.

Three accesses only to the ancient city can now be traced. One is the so-called Scalae Caci, a long sloping ascent cut through the rock (see fig. 17) from the side of the Circus Maximus; some remains of the earliest wall still exist along the sides of this steep ascent or staircase. The upper part of this has remains of a basalt pavement, added in later times, probably covering the more ancient rock-cut steps. The name of the gate which led at this point into Roma Quadrata is unknown. The only two gates whose name and position can be (with any degree of probability) identified are the Porta Romanulaand the Porta Mugionis (Plin., H.N., iii. 5, 9). The former of these, called Porta Romana by Festus (ed. Müller, p. 262), was at the foot of the Clivus Victoriae (see fig. 17), at the angle next the Forum Romanum. ^[571.] According to Festus it was so called by the Sabines of the Capitol because it was their natural entrance to Roma Quadrata (see also Varro, Z.i., v. 164, vi. 24). The original approach to it was by a road running up the lower extra-mural part of the hill from the direction of the Velabrum. In later times a more direct ascent to it was made from the Forum by a flight of steps, probably the Scalae Anulariae of Suetonius {Aug., Ί2 ; see figs. 16 and 17 and plan of the Forum, Plate VII.). The lower part of these stairs, now buried under S. Maria Libératrice, is shown in the marble plan of Rome; the upper part, that from the Nova Via to the Clivus Victoriae, still exists, and has recently been exposed. Traces of the Porta Mugionis or Mugonia (see Sol., i. 24) have been discovered near the temple of Jupiter Stator, where a basalt paved road leads up into the Palatine from the Summa Sacra Via and the Summa Nova Via, which join near the arch of Titus; exposure to weather has now destroyed the soft tufa blocks of which this gate was built. This is probably the “veterem Jtortam Palatii” of Livy (i. 12) through which the Romans fled when defeated by the Sabines. A third entrance, ^[572.] according to the ancient Etruscan rule (see Servius, Ad Aen., i. 422); probably existed on the east side of the hill, but its site is uncertain. Judging from the shape of the hill, it may very possibly have been under the existing palace of Severus, where a road leads from the stadium [9:20:813]down to the valley of the Coelian; at other places the east side is precipitous. The buildings of the emperors have, however, made such radical changes in the form of the ground that any degree of certainty on this point is impossible. This third gate, according to Varro, who mentions (Z.Z., v. 164-5) all three, was called Janu-alis. ^[573. Rοm.,] With regard to the last gate there is some doubt whether he is right in its position; Macrobius (Satur., i. 9) places it on tlιe slopes of the Viminal. ^[574. De Mûris et Portis Romae, Bull. Comm. Αrch.,] Remains of Period of Kings (753-509 b.c.).

The most important remains of the regal period are the great wall, principally the work of Servius Tullius, by which he included within one circuit the separately fortified hills which were then inhabited,—the Palatine, Capitoline, Aventine, Quirinal, and Ccelian, and added two more, the Esquiline and Viminal. These seven hills formed the Septimontium ^[575. Qures. Rom., Rome,] (Varro, L. L., iv. 41, vi. 24). Of even earlier date was the fort (Liv., i. 33) on the top of the Jani-culum, connected by walls with the Pons Sublicius, some massive foundations of which still exist, though now buried near the church of S. Pietro in Montorio. Existing remains show that the great wall is of more than one date; part is probably earlier than Servius, and may be remains of the wall which, according to Livy (i. 36, 38) and Dionysius (iii. 37), was planned and in part carried out by Tarquinius Priscus; it would seem impossible that a work of such gigantic magnitude could have been begun and completed in the lifetime of one man. It should, however, be remembered that a complete circuit of new wall was not required in this undertaking; each, probably, of the five hills first inhabited had its own fortifications, and these were utilized in the line of the new avail. The space thus included was divided by Servius for political, military, and religious purposes into four regiones ( Varro, L. L., v. 46-54)— (1) the Suburana, including the Coelian, and probably most of its adjacent valleys, with the Subura, the Carinae, and part of the Esquiline—the derivation of Suburana from sub urbe is from Junius, quoted by Varro; (2) Esquilina, the main part of the Esquiline, including the Oppius and Cispius (es-quil-iae, dwellings outside, cf. in-quil-inus); (3) Collina, the Viminal and Quirinal, which were called “colles” in contradistinction to the other five hills, which were called “montes”; (4) Palatina, the Palatine and its adjacent spurs, the Velia and Germalus. It will be observed that these four regiones do not include the Aventine, the Capitol, and some of their adjacent valleys,—an omission for which it is not easy to account. ^[576. (Handbuch, Ann. Inst.,]

Excavations of the last fifteen years have done much to determine the line of the Servian wall (see Plate VI.), especially the great works undertaken in laying out a new quarter of the city on the Quirinal, Esquiline, and Viminal, which have laid bare and then mostly destroyed long lines of wall, especially along the agger. Beginning from the Tiber, which the Servian wall touched at a point near the present Ponte Rotto, and separating the Forum Olitorium (outside) from the Forum Boarium (inside), it ran in a straight line to the Capitoline Hill, the two crests of which, the Capitolium and the Arx, with the intermediate valley the Asylum, were surrounded by an earlier fortification, set (Dionys., ix. 68) eτrt ∖ 0φοLs . . . καl πέτραι,ς άττοτόμοις. In this short space there were three gates,—(1) the Porta Flumentana next the river (see Cic., Ad Att., vii. 3; Liv., xxxv. 19, 21); (2) Porta Triumphalis, site unknown and usually only mentioned in connexion with triumphal processions (see Cic., In Pis., 23; Joseph., BM. JuJ, vii. 5, 4),— it was probably not used except on the occasion of triumphs; (3) Porta Carmentalis, close to the Capitolium. ^[577. Ad Cic. in Toga,] From the Capitoline Hill the wall passed to the Quirinal along a spur of elevated ground, afterwards completely cut away by Trajan. Close to the Capitol was the gate afterwards called the Porta Ratumena, whence issued the Via Lata (Plut., In Publ., 13; Plin., H.N., viii. 42). Remains of the wall and foundations of the gate exist in Via di Marforio, Nos. 81 C and 81 E. After passing Trajan’s forum, the first remains of the walls are on the slope of the Quirinal in the Colonna gardens. Near the foot of the Quirinal was the Porta Fontinalis (Liv., XXXV. 10). A piece of the wall has been exposed in the new Via Nazionale, and also an archway under the Palazzo Antonelli, which has been thought to be the Porta Fontinalis. This arch is, however, only 6 feet 6 inches wide and (to the springing of the arch) 5 feet high, which seems too small for one of the principal gates. The Porta Sanqualis (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 345) was also on the Quirinal, probably on the slope between the Trevi fountain and the royal palace. Its position is indicated by the existence of some tombs which give the line of the road. On the north-west of the Quirinal was the Porta Salutaris (Festus, p. 327; Liv., ix. 43), probably near the “Quattro Fontane.” In the Barberini palace gardens, and especially in those of the ViUa Bar-berini (Horti Sallustiani), extensive remains of the wall have been recently exposed and destroyed,—which was also the fate of that fine piece of wall that passed under the new office of finance, with the Porta Collina, which was not on the line of the present road, but about 50 yards to the south (see Dionys., ix. 68; Strabo, v. 3). Thus far in its course from the Capitol the wall skirted the slopes of hills, which were once much more abrupt than they are now; but from the Porta Collina to the Porta Esquilina it crossed a large tract of level ground; and here, by the construction of his great agger, Servius gained the strength which elsewhere was given by the natural formation of the hills. The whole line of this agger has been recently traced and mostly destroyed. About the middle of it the Porta Viminalis was found in 1872; it stood, as Strabo says, υπό μiσω τφ χώματι, and from it led a road which passed through the Porta Chiusa (ancient name unknown) in Aurelian’s wall. Foundations of the Porta Esquilina were found in 1876 close behind the arch of Gallienus. The further course of the wall across the valley of the Colosseum, with its Porta Querquetulana and Porta Ccelimontana, probably a little beyond, is the least known part of the circuit. Hence the wall skirts the slopes of the Ccelian to the valley along which the Via Appia passed through the Porta Capena, near the church of S. Gregorio. Its line along the Aventine is fairly distinct, and near S. Balbina and in the Vigna Torlonia are two of the best-preserved pieces,—the former 11 courses high (22 feet), the latter 25 (50 feet). Under the Aventine it appears to have touched the river near the existing foundations supposed to be those of the Pons Sublicius. The Porta Trigemina was close by the bank. Hence to our starting-point the river formed the defence of the city, with its massive quay wall, —the κά\η &κτη of Plutarch (born., 20). A fragmentary passage of Varro (L. L., v. 163) mentions two other gates, Naevia and Rauduscula, “the bronze gate,” but their positions are unknown. The site of the Porta Navalis is also very doubtful; it was probably not in the Servian wall.

The wall is built of blocks of tufa, usually the softer kinds, but varying according to its position, as in most cases the stone used was that quarried on the spot. In some places a good deal of peperino is used. The blocks average from 23 to 24 inches in thickness—roughly 2 Roman feet—and are laid in alternate courses of headers and stretchers. The best preserved piece of wall—that on the Aventine in the Vigna Torlonia—has one complete arch and the starting of another; their sills are about 34 feet from the ground outside, and probably level with the ground inside (see fig. 8).

These arches, though built of the harder stone, are not later insertions, but are contemporary with the wall itself. The blocks, both beds and Verticaljoints, are very carefully worked and set in mortar; in most cases they are bevelled round the joints. Some blocks are of great length, — άμάξιοι ∖ ιθoι Dionysius calls them. At this place the wall is backed with a thick mass of concrete; the use of the arched openings is doubtful: they may have been embrasures for catapults. The discoveries of recent years have shown the correctness of the description given by Dionysius (ix. 68) of the great agger, with its wall and foss, begun by the earlier kings and completed by the last Tarquin. Fig. 9 shows it in section; the earth taken from the foss (which was IOO feet wide at the bottom by 30 deep) was heaped up to form the agger, and was kept in its position by a lofty retaining wall on the front and a lower one behind. The outer wall was in places strengthened with massive buttresses closely set, or with towers; in other places it had no projections. The back wall, the position of which shows the thickness of the [9:20:814]agger, is in parts about 33 feet from the front one, but it varies in this respect; in other parts the agger appears to have been more than 50 feet thick. Between the railway station and the Dogana a fine lofty piece of the front wall remains, with traces of the Porta Viminalis and of the lower back wall. Unfortunately the whole of the bank or agger proper has been removed, and the rough back of the great retaining wall exposed. Both tufa and peperino are used; the blocks vary in length, but average in depth the usual 2 Roman feet. The railway cutting which has destroyed a great part of the agger showed clearly the section of the whole work: the strata of different kinds of soil which appeared on the sides of the foss appeared again in the agger, but reversed as they naturally would be in the process of digging out and heaping up. Dionysius (ix. 68) states the length of the agger to have been 7 stadia—that is, about 1400 yards—which agrees (roughly speaking) with the actual discoveries. Originally one road ran along the bottom of the foss and another along its edge; the latter existed in imperial times. But the whole foss appears to have been filled up, probably in the time of Augustus, and afterwards built upon; houses of mixed brick and opus reticulatum still exist against the outside of the great wall, which was itself used as the back wall of these houses, so that we now see painted stucco of the time of Hadrian covering parts of the wall of the kings. Another row of houses seems to have faced the road mentioned above as running along the upper edge of the foss, thus forming a long street. As early as the time of Augustus a very large part of the wall of the kings had been pulled down and built over, so that even then its circuit was difficult to trace (Dionys., iv. 13). A very curious series of masons’ marks exists on the buildings of the regal period, es pecially on the stones of the agger wall and those of the small cellae on the Palatine near the Scalae Caci.

They are deeply incised, usually on the ends of the blocks, and aver age from 10 to 14 inches in length: some are single letters or monograms; others are numbers; and some are doubtful signs, e.g., l, which may be the numeral 50 or the Etruscan CH. Fig. 10 shows the chief forms from the Palatine and Esquiline. ^[578. Ann. Inst., Topogr.,]

The Servian city did not include what is now the most crowded part of Rome, and which under the empire was the most architecturally magnificent, ^[579.] namely, the great Campus Martius, which was probably to a great extent a marsh. It was once called Ager Tarquiniorum, but after the expulsion of the Tarquins was named Campus Martius from an altar to Mars, dating from prehistoric times (Liv., ii. 5). ^[580. Mura di Roma, Porte del Recinto di Servio, De Romie Muris, Ann. Inst., Mon. Inst., Ann. Inst., Mon. Inst., Le Mura di Rohm,]

Of that wonderful system of massive arched sewers ^[581.] by which, as Dionysius (iii. 68) says, every street of Rome was drained into the Tiber considerable remains exist, especially of the Cloaca Maxima, which runs from the valley of the Subura, under the Forum (see Plate VII.), along the Velabrum, and so into the Tiber by the round temple in the Forum Boarium; it is still in use, and well preserved at most places. Its mouth, an archway in the great quay wall (κάλη άκτη) nearly 11 feet wide by 12 high, consists of three rings of peperino “voussoirs,” most neatly fitted. The rest of the vault and Avails is built of mixed tufa and peperino. ^[582.] Pliny (H. N., xxxvi. 24) gives an interesting account of what is probably this great sewer, big enough (he says) for a loaded hay-cart to pass along. The mouths of two other similar but smaller eloaeae are still visible in the great quay wall near the Cloaca Maxima, and a whole network of sewers exists under a great part of the Servian city. Some of these are not built with arched vaults, but have triangular tops formed of courses of stone on level beds, each projecting over the one below,—a very primitive method of construction, employed in the Tullianum (see fig. 11). The great quay wall of tufa and peperino which lined both banks of the Tiber for a ∣ considerable distance also belongs to the regal period, and was a work of gι∙eat solidity and strength; it is noAv mostly destroyed by the action of the river. In later times this massive wall was extended, as the city grew, all along the bank of the Campus Martiusand, having lost its importance as a line of defence, had frequent flights of stairs built against it, descending to the river. Some of these are shown in one of the fragments of the marble plan (see Jordan, For. Ur. Rom.; Frag. 169). In 1879 a travertine block Avas dredged up inscribed P . BARRONΓVS . BARBA . AED . CVR. GRADOS. REFECIT, dating from the 1st century B.c. Tliis records the repair of one of these numerous river stairs. The name ‘ ‘ pul-chrum Iittus” is not a classical term, but simply a translation of Plutarch’s κάλη άκτη. ^[583.]

The Tullianum is probably, next to the remains of Roma Quad-rata, the earliest of the existing buildings of Rome.

It is partly cut in the tufa rock of the Capitoline Hill and partly built of 2 - feet blocks of tufa, set with thin beds of pure lime mortar, in courses projecting one over the other (see fig. 11). Its name is probably derived, not from Servius Tullius, as Varro (v. 151) asserts, but from an early Latin word, tuilius, a spring of water; its original use Avas probably that of a cistern or Avell.

It Avas closed by a conical vault, arched in shape, but not constructionally an arch,

—very like the so-called “tomb of Agamemnon” at Mycenae, and many early Etruscan tombs. When the upper room with its arched vault, also of tufa,

Avas built the upper part of the cone seems to have been removed, and a flat stone floor (a flat arch in construction) substituted. This cannot be other than the “career . . . media urbe imminens foro” of Livy (i. 33), Avho speaks also (xxxiv. 44) of an “inferiorem car-cerem,” and at xxιx. 22 of a criminal being put in the Tul-Iianum. That its use as a cistern was abandoned is shown by the cloaca which leads from it, through the rock, to a branch of the Cloaca Maxima. This horrible place was used as a dun[9:20:815]geon, prisoners being lowered through a hole in the stone floor, —the only access. The present stairs are modern. The two chambers are vividly described by Sallust (C⅛f., 55). The entrance to the upper prison was on the left of the stairs leading up from the Forum to the Clivus Argentarius, the road to the Porta Ratumena (see Plate VL ). Lentulns and the Catiline conspirators, as well as Jugurtha and other prisoners of importance, were killed or starved to death in this fearful dungeon, which is called to βάραθρον by Plutarch (Marius, xii.). According to a doubtful tradition of the Catholic Church St Peter and St Paul were imprisoned in the Tullianum. The name Mamertine prison is of mediaeval origin. The front wall of the prison was restored in the reign of Tiberius 22 A.D., and bears this inscription on a projecting string-course—C. VIBIVS . C . F. RVFINVS . M. COCCEIV[S NERV A] COS. EX. S. C. ^[584.] The floor of the upper prison is about 16 feet above the level of the Forum, to which access was given by a flight of steps—Scalae Gemoniae—on which the bodies of criminals were exposed; ^[585. Ηist., Vit.,] Pliny (H.N., viii. 61) calls it the “stairs of sighs” (grad us gemitorii). Forum Ramanum and Adjacent Buildings.

The Forum Romanum or Magnum, as it was called in late times to distinguish it from the imperial fora, occupies a valley which extends from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to the north-east part of the Palatine. Till the construction of the great cloacae it was, at least in wet seasons, marshy ground, in which were several pools of water. In early times it was bounded on two sides by rows of shops and houses, dating from the time of the first Tarquin (Liv., i. 35). The shops on the south-west side facing the Sacra Via, where the Basilica Julia afterwards was built, were occupied by the Tabernae Veteres. ^[586.] The shops on the northern side, being occupied by silversmiths, were called Tabernae Argentariae (see Liv., xxvi. 27, xl. 51), and in later times, when rebuilt after a fire, were called Tabernae Novae. ^[587.] An altar to Saturn (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1), traditionally set up by the companions of Hercules, and an altar to Vulcan, both at the end towards the Capitol, with the temple of Vesta and the Regia at the opposite end, were among the earliest monuments grouped around the Forum. The Lacus Curtius vanished, as Varro says (Z.Z., v. 148-149), probably with other stagnant pools, when the cloacae were constructed (Liv., i. 38, 56). ^[588. (Fast.,] Another pool, the Lacus Servilius, near the Basilica Julia, was preserved in some form or other till the imperial period. Under Sulla it was used as a place to expose the heads of many senators murdered in his proscriptions (Cic., Rose. Am., 32; Seneca, De Prov., 3). The Vulcanal or Hephaesteum was an open area, so called from the early altar to Vulcan, and was (like the Comitium) a place of public meeting, at least during the regal period. ^[589. H.N, Quses. Rom.,] It was raised above the Comitium, and probably was a space levelled on the lower slope of the Capitoline Hill behind the arch of Severus; but its exact form and position are very doubtful. It was probably much encroached upon when the temple of Concord was enlarged in the reign of Augustus.

Plate VIL gives a carefully measured plan of the Forum, showing the most recent discoveries.

Unlike the fora of the emperors, each of which was surrounded by a lofty wall and built at one time from one design, the architectural form of the Forum Romanum was a slow growth. The marshy battle-field of the early inhabitants of the capitol and Palatine became, when the ground was drained by the great cloacae, under a united rule the most convenient site for political meetings, for commercial transactions, and for the pageants of rich men’s funerals, ludi scenici, and gladiatorial games. ^[591. Epit., Caes., Aug., Tib.,] For these purposes a central space, though but a small one, was kept clear of buildings; but it was gradually occupied in a somewhat inconvenient manner by an ever-accumulating crowd of statues and other honorary monuments. On three sides the limits of this open space are marked by paved roads, faced by the stately buildings which gradually took the place of the simple wooden tabernae and porticus ^[592.] of early times. This central space was essentially the meeting-place of the plebs, or the Comitia Tributa, while the patricians, the Comitia Curiata, met on the Comitium, which adjoined the Forum. The Comitium ^[593. Ann. Inst., Die Lage des Comitiums.] was a level space in front of the Curia; the construction of both is ascribed to Tullus Hostilius. For the position of the Comitium and the Curia ^[594.] see plan of Forum (Plate VII.). Varro (Z.7λ,v. 155-156) gives the following account of the buildings which were grouped along the northern angle of the Forum.

“Comitium ab eo quod coibant eo comitiis curiatis et Iitium causa. Curiae duorum generum, nam et ubi curarent sacerdotes res divinas, ut Curiae Veteres, et ubi senatus humanas, ut Curia Hostilia, quod primum aedificavit Hostilius rex. Ante hanc Rostra, quojus loci id vocabulum, quod ex hostibus capta fixa sunt rostra. Sub dextra hujus a Comitio locus substructus, ubi nationum subsistèrent Iegati qui ad senatum essent missi. Is Graecostasis appel-Iatus a parte ut multa. Senaculum supra Graecostasim, ubi Aedis Concordiae et Basilica Opimia. Senaculum vocatum, ubi senatus, aut ubi seniores consistèrent.”

The Curia or senate-house passed through many vicissitudes. At first called Curia Hostilia from its founder Tullus Hostilius (Liv., i. 30), it lasted till 52 b.c., when it was burnt at the funeral of Clodius, and was then rebuilt by the son of Sulla, and from his gens called Curia Cornelia (Dion Cass., xl. 50; Plin., H.N., xxxiv. 12). It was again rebuilt by Augustus (29 b.c.) under the name of the Curia Julia, as recorded in the inscription of Ancyra (see Angora)—CVRiAM. et . continens . Ei. chalcidicvm ... feci. Little is known about the adjoining buildings called the Athenaeum and Chalcidicum; Dion Cassius (Ii. 22) mentions the group. In the reign of Domitian the Curia Julia was again rebuilt (Prosp. Aquit., p. 571), and lastly by Diocletian. There is strong evidence to show that the existing church of S. Adriano is the Curia of Diocletian, though of course much altered, and with its floor raised about 20 feet above the old level. Fig. 12 shows the front existing towards the Forum, omitting later windows and doors. As late as the time of Du Perac ( Vesiigj di Roma) the old entrance and level were preserved. He gives a drawing ^[595. e gli Uffici del Senato Romano,] of it with steps descending to the doorway. The ancient bronze doors now at the end of the nave of the Lateran basilica originally belonged to this building, and were removed thence by Alexander Λ II. Fig. 12 is derived from actual measurements of the part above ground, while the lower part, now buried, is derived from Du Perac’s drawing and from the bronze doors at the Lateran, which give the size of the opening, [9:20:816] and show how deeply the buried part descends below the present level. The brick cornice and marble consoles, covered with enriched mouldings in stucco, and the sham marble facing, also of stucco, if compared with similar details in the baths of Diocletian, leave little doubt as to this being a work of his time, and not, as has been usually assumed, the work of Pope Honorius I., who (625-633 A.D.) consecrated it as the church of S. Adriano.

From the Curia a flight of steps led down to the Co-mitium (Liv., i. 36), the level of which appears from the existing steps and pavement near the arch of Severus (see Plate VII.) to have been about 2 feet below that of the Forum, and not above it, as Bunsen and others have asserted. On the Comitium stood the ancient rostra till they were rebuilt on a new site by Julius Caesar in 44 B.c. The ancient rostra were so called in 338 b.c., when Camillus and Mcenius defeated the Latin fleet at Antium, and the beaks (rostra) of the captured ships were fixed to an existing platform on the Comitium for orators. It was also called a “templum” because the structure was consecrated by the augurs (Cic., De Orat., iii. 3). Other rostra, named for distinction Rostra Julia, were so called from the beaks of ships taken at Actium and affixed by Augustus to the podium of the temple built by him in honour of the deified Julius. Both are mentioned by Suetonius (Aug., 100). There were several other platforms or tribunals for orators in and about the Forum, but they were not called rostra. From the original rostra Cicero delivered his Second and Third Catiline Orations, and they were the scene of some of the most important political struggles of Rome, such as the enunciation of their laws by the Gracchi. Beside the Comitium another monument was erected, also adorned with beaks of ships, to commemorate the same victory at Antium. This was the Columna Moenia, so called in honour of Mcenius (Plin., H.N., xxxiv. 11, vii. 60). The Columna Duilia was a similar monument, erected in honour of the victory of C. Duilius over the Punic fleet in 260 B. c.; a fragment of it with inscription (restored in imperial times) is preserved in the Capitoline Museum.^[596.] Columns such as these were called “columnae rostratae.”

Near the Comitium, on the side towards the Capitol, was the Graecostasis, a platform where foreign ambassadors stood to hear the speeches (see Varro, loc. cit. y ). It appears probable that, like the rostra, the Graecostasis was moved in the 1st century b.c.; and this name has been given with some probability to the curved marble-faced platform behind the existing rostra.

The Senaculum appears to have been a place of preliminary meeting for the Senate before entering the Curia (Liv., xli. 27; Val. Max., ii. 2, 6); it adjoined the temple of Concord, and when this was rebuilt on an enlarged scale in the reign of Augustus it appears probable that its large projecting portico became the Senaculum (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1). It may possibly have once been identical with the Area Concordhe mentioned by Livy (xl. 19) in connexion with the Area Vulcani (comp, xxxix. 46).

A great part of the north-east side of the Foram was occupied by a. two basilicae, which were more than once rebuilt under different names. The first of these appears to have been adjacent to the Curia, on its south side; it was called the Basilica Porcia, and was founded by the elder Cato in 184 b.c. (see Liv., xxxix. 44, and Plut., Cato Major, 19); it was burnt with the Curia at Clodius’s funeral. Adjoining it another basilica, called Aemilia et Fulvia (A arro, vi. 4), was built in 176 b.c. by the censors M. Fulvius and M. Aemilius Lepidus; ^[597.] it stood, according to Livy (xl. 51),

“post argentarias novas,” the line of silversmiths’ shops along the north-east side of the Forum. In 50 b.c. it was rebuilt by L. Aemilius Paulus (Plut., Caes., 29; Appian, Bell. Civ., ii. 26), and was more than once restored within the few subsequent years by members of the same family. Its later name was the Basilica Pauli, and it was remarkable for its magnificent columns of Phrygian marble (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 24) or pavonazetto.

Near the middle of the north-east side of the Forum stood also Ί the small bronze temple of Janus, ^[598. Αιi Aen.,] the doors of which were shut c on those rare occasions when Rome was at peace. ^[599. Μοn. Ancyr.; Bell. GοVι., Aug.,] A first brass of Nero shows it as a small cella, with richly ornamented frieze and cornice. Another aedicula near that of Janus was the shrine of Venus Cloacina (or the Purifier), probably on the line of the great cloaca (Liv., iii. 48; Plin., H.N., xv. 36). Two or more other shrines of Janus stood on this side, behind the shops of the money-lending argentarii; and the word “Janus” was used to imply the place ofusurers (Hor., Sat., ii. 3, 18).

So far the buildings mentioned have been mostly those whose sites are still buried under the line of modern houses on the northeast of the Forum, the only part which has not yet been excavated. Turning to those of which existing remains are visible, at the north-west end the rostra of Julius Caesar mark the limit of the Forum in this direction, as the arch of Fabius beside the temple of Faustina did in the other.

Plate VII. shows the plan of the rostra, with the curved Graecostasis 1 behind it. It is an oblong platform about 78 feet long and 11 feet ι high above the level of the Forum; its ground floor, paved with herring-bone bricks, is 2 feet 6 inches below the Forum paving. Its end and side walls are of tufa blocks, 2 feet thick and 2 feet wide, each carefully clamped to the next with wooden dovetail dowels. Its floor was supported by a series of travertine piers, carrying travertine lintels, on which the floor slabs rested (see fig. 13). Outside it was completely lined with Greek marble and had a richly moulded plinth and cornice; none of the latter is in situ, but many pieces lie scattered around. A groove cut in the top of the cornice shows the place where marble cancelli were fixed; one of the cornice blocks is partly without this groove, showing that the screen did not extend along the whole front of the rostra. This agrees with a relief on the arch of Constantine, representing the emperor making an oration from the rostra, with other buildings at this end of the Forum shown behind.

In this relief the screen is shown with a break in the middle, so that the orator, standing in tho centre, was visible from head to foot. Two tiers of large holes to hold the bronze rostra are drilled right through the tufa wall, and even through the travertine pilasters where one happens to come in the way; these holes show that there were nineteen rostra in the lower tier, and twenty above set over the intermediate spaces of the lower row. The back -wall of the rostra is of concrete faced with brick, which, being probably the work of Julius Caesar in 44 b.c., is the earliest dated example of brickwork in Rome. The inside space, under the main floor of the rostra, is coated thickly with stucco,—the brick wall being studded in the usual way with iron nails to form a key for the plaster.

In spite of the assertions of Bunsen, Jordan, and others that the ι curved platform behind (conjecturally called the Graecostasis) is a work of late date, it is evident from various constructional points, visible at the junction of the two structures, that it existed before the rostra, which when built completely hid its rich lining and the pilasters of porta santa marble which decorated its front,—very strong evidence as to the curved platform being earlier in date. The level
[9:20:817]

of the top of this platform and that of the rostra appear to have coincided exactly, so that the whole formed one continuous marble-paved platform, and the rostra would be reached, not by steps, but from the higher ground towards the Capitol, from which access is given to the curved platform and so on to the floor of the rostra. The bronze rostra on this structure of 44 B.c. were believed to be the original beaks from Antium, moved from the old rostra (Floras, i. 11). On its marble platform stood many statues, ^[600. Phil., Η.N., Bell. Civ., Belt. Civ., Pro Sext.,] e.g., of Sulla, Pompey, two of Julius Caesar, and others (see Dion Cass., xlii. 18, and xliv. 4). Owing probably to the weight of the many statues proving too much for the travertine piers, which are not set on their natural beds but endways, and therefore are very weak, the structure seems to have given way at more than one time and the floor has been supported by piers and arches of brick-faced concrete, inserted either in place of or at the sides of the shattered piers. These later additions, apparently of the 3d and 4th centuries, are omitted in Plate VΠ. for the sake of clearness. The moulded plinth of the curved platform is of Pentelic marble, some of the blocks of which are incised with masons’ marks, namely, the Greek letters Γ, Δ, E, Z, H, Θ, and K. A number of metal pins on the face of the slabs of porta sauta marble which line its front show that emblemata or reliefs, probably of gilt bronze, were once fastened to the marble. ^[601. Ann. Inst, Gli Avanzi dei Rostri, Archieologia] The use of Greek marble shows that this platform can be but little earlier than the rostra (44 B.c.); and it appears possible that this is the Graecostasis, transferred, like the rostra, to a new site. ^[602.] See Varro (L.K, v. 155) and Cicero (Ad Quint. Fr., ii. 1), who mention the original structure. Restorations of the later one by Antoninus Pius and Diocletian are mentioned by Capitolinus (Ank Pius, 8), and in the Catak Imp. Vieirn. given by Preller (Regionen, p. 143),—in both cases after injury by fire, a fact which seems to show that in later times the Graecostasis had some roofed porticus or shelter and was not a mere open platform as it was originally.

At the northern end of the curved platform there is a cylindrical structure of concrete faced with brick, and lined with thin marble slabs; it is in three stages, each diminishing in size, and appears to be an addition of about the time of Severus. This is usually identified with the Umbilicus Romae, or central point of the city, mentioned in the Notitia and the Einsiedeln MS. (see Preller, -BegZone??, Reg. viii.). According to another theory it is the base of the gilt statue of the Genius Populi Romani set up by Aurelian; but this is contradicted by the form of the structure, which is not that of the pedestal of a statue. ^[603. Handbuch, Xotitia.] At the other extremity probably stood the Milliarium Aureum, a marble column sheathed in gilt bronze and inscribed with the names and distances of the chief towns on the roads which radiated from the thirty-seven gates of Rome (Plin., H.N, iii. 9). It was set up by Augustus in 29 b.c. and its position “sub aede Saturai” is indicated by Tacitus (Hist., i. 27; see schol. on Suet., Otho, 6, and Plut., Galba, 24). The Milliarium is mentioned in the Notitia (Reg. viii.) as being near the Vicus Jugarius. The position shown in Plate VII. agrees with both these indications, being near the start of the Vicus Jugarius, and close under the temple of Saturn. Fragments of a curved marble plinth and frieze with floriated reliefs, now lying in the Basilica Julia, probably belonged to the pedestal of this column; they were found by Canina near the supposed site. ^[604.]

The position of the temple of Saturn is described in Mon. Aneyr. (see below) and shown on the marble plan, and is also identified by various passages in ancient writers. Varro (L.I ∣ ., v. 42). speaks of it as being “in faucibus Capitolii ”; ^[605.] Servius (Ad Aen., ii. 115) says that it is in front of the Clivus Capitolinus, and near the temple of Concord (see Plate VII. ). It was built against a steep slope or outlying part of the Capitoline Hill (comp. Dionys., i.

34) on the site of a prehistoric altar to Saturn, after whom the Capitoline Hill was originally called Mons Satumius. The public treasury was part of this temple (Serv., Ad Aen., ii. 116, and Alacrob., Sat., i. 8). ^[606. Αηt.hιsc., Ctαιιd., Ann.,] The original temple is said by Varro (ap. AIacrob., i. 8) to have been begun by the last Tarquin, and dedicated by T. Lartius, the first dictator, 501B.c.; but Dionysius (vi. 1) and Livy (ii. 21) attribute it to the consuls A. Sempronius and Al. AIinucius in 497 b.c. It was rebuilt on a larger scale by AIunatius Plancus in the reign of Augustus (Suet., Aug., 29). The only part remaining of this date is the very lofty podium of massive travertine blocks, and. part of the lower course of Athenian marble, with which the whole was faced. In the 16th century a piece oi the marble frieze was found, inscribed L . PLANCVS . L . F . COS . IMPER . ITER . DE . MANIB . (C. LL., vi. 1316). The erection of the six granite columns in the front and two at the sides, with their clumsily patched entablature, belongs to the last rebuilding in the time of Diocletian. Some of these fine columns are evidently earlier than this rebuilding, but were refixed with rude caps and bases. One of the columns is set wrong way up, and the whole work is of the most careless sort. Part of the inscription, once inlaid with bronze, recording this latest rebuilding still exists on the entablature (see Gori, KFrario di Saturno, 1873). ^[607. Phil.,] On the Forum side the temple is flanked by the Vicus Jugarius, while the steep Clivus Capitolinus winds round the front of the great flight of steps leading up to the cella, and then turns along the northwest side of the temple. ^[608.] The Vicus Jugarius (see Plate VII.), part of the basalt paving of which is now exposed, was so called (see Festus, ed. AIiiller, p. 104) from an altar to Juno Juga, the guardian of marriage. Starting from the Forum, it passed between the temple of Saturn and the Basilica Julia, then close under the cliff of the Capitolium (see Liv., xxxv. 21) and on to the Porta Cannen-talis. It was spanned at its commencement by a brick-faced arch lined with marble, the lower part of which exists, and is not earlier than the 3d or 4th century. ^[609.] At this end of the Forum the arch of Tiberius was built across the Sacra Via, which is narrowed as if to bring it under the span of the arch. It was erected in 17 a.d. to commemorate the recovery of the standards lost by Varus. ^[610. Ann.,] A few fragments remain, scattered about in various places

The Basilica Julia ^[611. Ang., Bas. Giulia, Excavazione della Bas. Giulia. Mon. Ancyr., “Forvm . Ivlivm . et. basilicam . qvae . fvit. inter . aedem . Castoris. et. aedem .

[9:20:818]

near it records its restoration by Septimins Severus in 199 a.d. after a tire; it was again burnt in 282 and restored by Diocletian. These tires had destroyed nearly all the fine marble arches of Augustus; and Diocletian rebuilt it mostly with brick or travertine piers, a few of which remain. ^[616.] A final restoration is recorded in an inscription discovered in the 16th century, and another in 1882, as being carried out by Gabinius Vettius Probianus, praefect of the city in 377 (Gruter, Inscr., clxxi. 7); the latter is on a pedestal which now stands in the Vicus Jugarius. Suetonius {Cal., 37) mentions that it was one of Caligula’s amusements to throw money to the people below from the roof of this basilica, which probably was a link in the bridge by which this maniac connected the Palatine with the Capitolium. ' The line of the bridge, which starts in the upper part of Caligula’s palace, passes over a lofty and massive brick-faced building, once lined with marble, which stands on the lower slopes of the Palatine. Suetonius’s account (C⅛Z., 22) of the bridge makes it very probable that this building is the temple of Augustus, as there is no other possible site for it on the line from the Palatine to the Capitolium. The intermediate stages from the temple to the basilica and thence to the Capitolium were probably merely a wooden structure, as no traces of it now remain. The temple of Augustus was begun by Tiberius and finished by Caligula (Suet., Cal., 21).

The Vicus Tuscus passes from the Sacra Via between the Basilica Julia and the temple of Castor to the Velabrum and Circus Maximus; its basalt paving has been exposed at many points along its whole line (see Liv., xxvii. 37). A very early statue of one of the chief Etruscan deities, Vortumnus, stood in this street, a little to the south-west of the Basilica Julia, where part of its pedestal was found in 1549 inscribed V0RTVMNVS TEMPORIBVS DIOCLE. TIANI . ET . MAXIMIANI . . . (CM. L., vi. 804; ^[617. Vαt,, (Εleg.,] see also Pseudo-Ascon., Ad Cie. Verr., ii. 1, 59). The Vicus Tuscus was also called Thurarius, from shops of perfume-sellers (see Hor., Sat., ii. 3, 228, and Ep., ii. 269). It is the street along which processions passed, mentioned by Cicero ( Verr., ii. 1, 59) as extending “a signo Vertumni in Circum Maximum.”

The temple of Castor ^[618. Moh. Α>ιeyr.] on the south-east side of the Viens Tus-. eus was founded to commemorate the apparition in the Forum of the Dioscuri announcing the victory of Aulus Postumus at Lake

Regillus, 496 b.c., and was dedicated in 482 b. c. by the son of A. Postumus (Liv., ii. 20, 42; Dionys., vi. 13; Plut., Coriol., 3; Ov., Fast., i. 707). In 119 b.c. it was restored by the consul L. Metellus Dalmaticus (Ascon., In Cic. Pro Scaur., 46) and finally rebuilt in the reign of Augustus by Tiberius and Drusus, 6 A.n. (Suet., Tib., 20; Ov., Fast., i. 705; Dion Cass., lv. 8, 27), to which period belong the three existing Corinthian columns and piece of entablature, all very delicate and graceful in detail, and of the finest workmanship, in Pentelic marble; the design is of pure Greek style. One point shows Roman timidity in the use of a lintel: the frieze is jointed so as to form a flat arch, quite needlessly, with the object of relieving the weight on the architrave. Its plan, hexastyle, with only eleven columns on the sides, is shown in Plate VII. and fig. 14. It had a lofty podium, lined with marble, and decorated with a heavy cornice and pilasters, one under each column. The podium is an interesting example of the enormous solidity of Roman buildings of the best period. Solid tufa walls, 8 feet thick, are built under the whole of the cella and the front row of columns, while the columns of the sides rest on spurs of similar walling, projecting at right angles from that under the cella; the part immediately under the columns is of travertine, and the spurs are united and strengthened laterally by massive flat arches, also of travertine. With the exception of a small chamber under the steps, entered from the Vicus Tuscus, the entire podium is filled up by a solid mass of concrete, made of broken tufa, pozzolana, and lime, the whole forming a lofty platform, about 22 feet high, solid as a rock, on which the columns and upper structure are erected. Small chambers formed in the concrete basement, such as the one in this temple, occur in many instances, e.g., in the temples of Saturn, Divus Julius, and Concord. They were probably used as strong rooms, in which money and plate were deposited for safe keeping (see Juv., xiv. 260), a purpose for which Roman temples were frequently used. Two fragments of mosaic, with simple lozenge pattern in white marble and basalt, still exist in the cella of this temple. The level of the mosaic shows that it is of earlier date than the rebuilding of Tiljerius, as it lies considerably below the level of the later floor. It hasall the characteristics of early mosaic—very small tesserae fitted with great accuracy, like the early mosaic in the Regia. The temple of Castor was often used as a meeting-place for the

Senate, and its lofty podium formed a tribunal for orations. ^[619. J. Cκs.,] Close by it was another tribunal, probably merely a wooden sug-gestus—called the Tribunal Aurelium (see Cic., In Pis., 5, and Pro Sext., 15).

The Fons Ju-

turnae (see Ov., Fast., i. 705, and Dionys., vi.

13), at which the Dioscuri were fabled to have watered their horses, was beside their temple, and the circular traver tine curb close by has been sup posed to have belonged to this.

Its form, how ever, makes it more probable that it was the plinth of a screen round the Puteal Scri-

bonis or Libonis

(Hor.,2ξp., i. 19,

8, and Sat., ii.

6, 35),— a cir cular marble structure like a well-mouth, or namented with reliefs of lyres and garlands, used to enclose somespotstruck by lightning or sacred from other causes. It is shown on a denarius of the gens Scribonia. The Sacra Via, in its course from the Regia towards the temple of Saturn, originally passed in front of the temple of Castor; but in late times its line was changed, and it is now covered at this Jioint by rude paving of travertine and marble, probably not earlier than the 5th century. The ancient line is indicated by the Regia, shown on fig. 16.

On the other side of the Sacra Via stand the scanty remains of the temple of Divus Julius, erected by Augustus. Though little beyond its concrete core is left, its j>lan can be fairly well made out from the voids in the concrete, which show the position of the tufa foundations under the walls and columns (as in the temple of Castor). The temple itself, a hexastyle prostyle building, with close Jiyknostyle Intercolumniation (Vitr., iii. 2), stood on a lofty j∣odium with a curved recess in the front between two flights of stairs (see Plate VII.). The wall which now fills up the recess is a late addition. It is Jiossible that this very unusual plan was adopted in order that the recess might leave room for the preexisting altar (Aj∣jιian, Bell. Civ., ii. 148) or column (Suet., J. Caes., 85) erected by the Senate with the inscription PARENTI PATRIAe. The podium, which projects in front of the temple itself, was adorned with beaks from the ships taken at Actium (Dion Cass., Ii. 19), and hence it vas called the Rostra Julia, to distinguish it from the other rostra described above. Both were used for the funeral orations in honour of Augustus (Suet., Aug., IOO; see also Dion Cass., liv. 35). Besides the concrete core and the curved tufa wall of the recess, little now exists except a small bit of the mosaic of the cella floor and some fragments of the cornice and pediment, of fine Greek marble. This temj∣le is represented on coins of Augustus and Hadrian.

The temple of Vesta, founded according to tradition by Numa, ^[620.] stands at the southern angle of the Forum on the ancient line of the Sacra Via (0v., Trist., iii. 1, 28). No shrine in Rome was equal in sanctity to this little circular building, which contained the sacred fire and the relics on which the welfare and even the existence of Rome dejιended. The shrine was an “aedes sacra,” not a “templum” in the strict sense of the word, which means a building so inaugurated that it could be used for meetings of the Senate. The original building was destroyed in 390 B. C. by the Gauls; it was burnt again in 241 B.C., again in the great fire of Nero’s reign, and then in the reign of Commodus; after this it was rebuilt by [9:20:819]Severus, to whose age belong the fragments of columns, cornice, and other architectural features now lying around the ruined podium. These, with the help of representations of the temple on coins of Domitian, ^[621. Medaillons de Vempire Romain,] and an ancient relief in the Uffizi (see Lanciani, KAtrio di Vesta, 1884, pis. xix.-xxi.), are sufficient to make an accurate restoration (see Plate VIL and lig. 15). It consisted of a circular cella, surrounded by eighteen columns, with screens between them; the circular podium, about 10 feet high, still exists, mainly of concrete with some foundations of tufa blocks, which may belong to the original structure. In the time of Pliny (//.W, xxxiv. 7) the tholus or dome over the cella—symbolizing the canopy of heaven (0v., Fast., vi. 276)—was covered with Syracusan bronze. Horace’s mention (0<Z., i. 2, 13) of the destruction of the temple by a Tiber flood caused the mistaken notion that the similar round temple still existing near the exit of the Cloaca Maxima was the Aedes Vestae; but the flood of 1877 showed that the waters of the river could still reach this point in the Forum. Its position near the temple of Castor is mentioned by Martial (i. 71-73). ^[622. Thes. Αnt. Rom., Lesette Cose fatali di Roma, Hestia-Vesta, Vesta und die Laren, Vesta e Vestali,]

The Regia (see fig. 16), or residence of the pontifex maximus, was on the Sacra Via, close by the temple of Vesta. It also was traditionally founded by Numa, and used as his dwelling-house; it was destroyed in 390 B. c. by the Gauls, and was again burnt in 210 b.c. (Liv., xxvi. 27), when the temple of Vesta narrowly escaped. Julius Caesar, as pontifex maximus, resided here; and when Augustus succeeded to this office in 12 B.c. he gave the Regia to the vestals, having built himself a large house on the Palatine. When the Atrium Vestae or house of the vestals was rebuilt on an enlarged scale the Regia was nulled down and its site partly occupied by the new atrium. Ovid ( Trist., iii. 1, 28) describes this end of the Forum thus—

“Haec est a sacris quae via nomen habet,

Hic locus est Vestae, qui Pallada servat et ignem,

Hie fuit antiqui Regia parva Nuinse."

The excavations of the last few years have laid bare remains of this very interesting building, and show that it was a large house extending close up to the temple of Vesta,—0μoτotχos, as Dion Cassius (lvi. 27) says. ^[623. Archseologia] It was set at a quite different angle from the Atrium and other later buildings which were built over its foundations; this angle shows the original line of the Sacra Via, which in later tunes was diverted into a different direction. The existing remains are of several dates,—first, walls of soft tufa, part possibly of the earliest building; second, walls of hard tufa, of rather later date; and lastly, concrete walls faced with brick, decorated with painted stucco, and columns of travertine, also stuccoed and painted, ^[624.] witlι a large quantity of fine mosaic of that early sort which has very small tesserae put together with great accuracy. This last part probably belongs to the rebuilding by Domitius Calvinus in 35 b.c. (Dion Cass., xliii. 42). These valuable remains were preserved in spite of the erection of later buildings over them because the levels of the later floors were higher than those of the Regia, and thus covered and protected the mosaics and lower parts of the walls and columns (see fig. 16). Besides being a dwelling-house, the Regia contained a sacrarium, in which were preserved the sacred spears of Mars (Aul. Gell., iv. 6), and also the shrine of the Dea Ops Consiva, only entered by the vestals and the sacerdos publicus (Varro, KK, vi. 21).

The Atrium Vestae or house of the vestals, like the temple, was many times burnt and rebuilt; the existing building, which was excavated in 1883-84, is of the time of Hadrian, as is shown by the brick stamps. It consists of a large atrium or quadrangle with columns of cipollino. At one end is the tablinum, with three small rooms on each side of it,—probably for the six vestals. A bathroom, bakehouse, servants’ offices, and some rooms lined with rich marbles extend along the south-west side. This extensive building is set against the side of the Palatine, which is cut away to admit the lower story. Thus the level of the first upper floor is nearly the same as that of the Nova Via, on which it faces, about 23 feet above the ground floor. The upper floor is in part well preserved; it contains a large suite of bath and other rooms, which were probably the sleeping apartments of the vestals. All the better rooms and the baths are lined with polished marbles, many of great beauty and rarity; the floors are mostly mosaic of tesselated work. The paving of the tablinum was a beautiful specimen of inlay in porphyry and marble. In many places alterations and clumsy patchings of the 4th and 5th centuries are apparent. A number of statues of the chief vestal, or virgo vestalis maxima, with inscribed pedestals, were found in the atrium, mostly of the 3d century, though a few are earlier; these are of especial interest as illustrating the sacerdotal dress of the vestals. ^[625. Suffibulum L. L.,] Nothing but the Nova Via separates the Atrium Vestae from the palace of Caligula (see Plin., Ep., vii. 19; Aul. Gell., i. 12), which extends over the site of the Lucus Vestae,—“qui a Palatii radice in Novam Viam devexus est” (Cic., De Div., i. 45). A curious octagonal structure in the middle of the atrium (see fig. 16) looks very much like a border for flower-beds; and it is possible that this miniature garden was made by the vestals when Caligula built over their extensive grove on the slopes of the Palatine. By the main entrance from the Forum stood a small aedicula,—a large pedestal at the angles of which were columns supporting an entablature. ^[626. Popvlvsqve . romanvs . pecvnla . pvblica . facien-] It may have contained a statue of Vesta, there being none within the temple. It is of the time of Hadrian. The last of the vestals is mentioned by Zosimus (v. 38) as being alive in 394; but the Atrium continued to be partly inhabited for many centuries later. ^[627. L'Atrio di Vesta] In September 1884 a road was discovered leading up past the tablinum end of the Atrium from the Sacra Via to the Nova Via (see fig. 16). In about the 4th century this road appears to have been blocked up at the Nova Via end by a building which adjoined the Atrium Vestae.

At the east corner of the Forum stood the arch of Q. Fabius Maximus, consul in 121 B.c., called Allobrogicus from his victory

1884). 11 l , 1 l ,
[9:20:820]

over the Allobroges (schol. on Cic., In Verr., i. 7; Liv., Ep., lvi.; Plin., H.N., vii. 50). It marked the extreme limit of the Forum in this direction (Cic., Pro Plan., 7, 17), as the rostra did at the other end. This arch was dug up and mostly destroyed in 1540-50, near the temple of Faustina; on one of the fragments then discovered was inscribed Q . FABIVS . Q . F. MAXSVMVS . AED . CVR . REST. About twenty-live other fragments were found in 1882. ^[628. Ann. Inst., Not. degli Scαoi,] The arch of Augustus, erected in 29B.C., also stood near this point, but its exact site is uncertain. An inscribed block of its attic was found during the excavations of 1540-50.

The temple of Faustina the elder stands at the east angle of the Forum, facing the later line of the Sacia Via. It is prostyle hexastyle, and has monolithic columns of cipollino and a rich entablature of Greek marble, with graceful reliefs of griffins and candelabra on the frieze. ^[629.] The walls are of massive peperino, once lined with marble. On the front is inscribedDIVO. ANT0NIN0. ET. DIVAE. FAVSTINAE . EX . S . C. This temple, built by Antoninus Pius in memory of his wife, who died in 141, was after his death dedicated also to him, and the first line was then added (Capitolinus, Ant. Pius, 6). At an early period it was consecrated as the church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda, and a great part of its cella has been destroyed. The front is now excavated to the original level. This temple is shown on the reverse of several coins of Antoninus Pius; some Iiave the legend DEDICATIO. AEDIS.

The space between the north-west end of the Forum and the Tabularium is occupied by a range of important buildings (see Plate VII.). The chief of these is the temple of Concord (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 347) shown on a fragment of the marble plan, founded by Camillus in 367 b.c. (Plut., Cam., 42), and rebuilt by the brothers Tiberius and Drasus out of the spoils gained in Germany; it was rededicated in 10 a.d. (Suet., Tib., 20; Dion Cass., lv. 25). It is shown with unusual minuteness on the reverse of a first brass of Tiberius. It is probable that an earlier restoration was carried out by L. Opimius in 121 B.c. (Plut., C. Graeeh., 17; Appian, Bell. Civ., i. 26). The existing remains ^[630. τ] are of the rebuilding by Tiberius and Drusus, and show that it was unusual in plan, having a large cella much wider than its depth, and a very large projecting portico. Its construction is an interesting example of the Roman use of many different materials. The lower part of the walls was of massive tufa blocks, the upper part of the cella of travertine; and the inner low wall, which supported ranges of internal columns, was of mixed concrete, tufa, and travertine. The whole was lined with marble, white outside, and rich Oriental marbles inside (see fig. 5), which were also used for the pavement. The door-sill is made of enormous blocks of porta santa marble, in which a bronze Caduceus (emblem of Concord) was inlaid. Between the internal columns of the cella stood rows of statues; and the temple also contained a large collection of pictures, engraved gems, gold and silver plate, and other works of art, mostly the work of ancient Greek artists (see Plin., H.K, xxxiv. 19, xxxv. 36, 40, xxxvi. 67, xxxvii. 2). On the apex of the pediment was a group of three figures embracing; the tympanum was filled with sculpture; and statues were set in the open porch. Though now only the podium and the lower part of the cella wall exist, with foundations of the great flight of steps, many rich fragments both of the Corinthian entablature and of the internal caps and bases are preserved in the Capitol; and some of the marble lining is still wt situ. The Einsiedeln MS. ^[631.] gives part of the inscription of the front— S. P. Q. R. AEDEM. CONCORDIAE . VETVSTATE . COLLAPSAM . IN . MELIOREM . FACIEM . OPERE . ET . CVLTV. SPLENDIDIORE . RESTITVERVNT. ^[632. Bell. Cαi.] Another temple of Concord, built in 219B.C., stood on the Capitoline Arx (Liv., xxii. 33, xxvi. 23); and a bronze aedicula of Concord in the Area Vulcani, which must have been close by the great temple. This was dedicated by Cn. Flavius, 305 B.c. (see Liv., ix. 46); according to Pliny (H.K, xxxiii. 6) it stood “in Graecostasi, quae tunc supra Comitium erat.” Both these were probably only small shrines.

The temple of Vespasian stands close by that of Concord, abutting on the Tabularium in a similar way, and blocking up a doorway at the foot of a long flight of steps (see fig. 1). It consists of a nearly square cella with prostyle hexastyle portico of the Corinthian order; three of the columns are still standing, with their rich entablature, the frieze of which is sculptured with sacred instru-

ments. The avails are of enormous blocks of travertine with strong iron clamps; the whole was lined with white Pentelic marble outside, and inside with coloured Oriental marbles. There was an internal range of columns, as in the temple of Concord. This temple was built by Domitian, c. 94 a.d., in honour of his father Vespasian. The inscription on the entablature, given in the Einsiedeln MS., records a restoration by Severus and Caracalla—DIVO. VESPASIANO. AVGVSTO. S . P. Q . R. IMPP. CAESS . SEVERVS . ET. ANTONINVS. PII . FELIC . AVGG . R[ESTITVER]VNT; part of the last word only now exists. ^[633. Tempi di Vespasiano e Concordia,]

In the narrowspace between the temples of Concordand Vespasian (only about 7 feet in width) a small brick and concrete aedicula stands against the Tabularium. This has been wrongly called a shrine of Faustina, on the authority of a small inscribed pedestal found near it; ^[634.] but there is clear constructional proof that it is contemporary with the temple of Vespasian, and is therefore of the time of Domitian. ^[635.] It may possibly have been a shrine dedicated to Titus, whose name does not occur in the inscription of the adjoining temple, though the catalogue in the Curwsurn, Reg. ix., mentions a dedication to both father and son. ^[636. Begionen der Stadt born, Codex Topog. Boniee,]

The next building is the Porticus XII. Deorum Consentium, a large marble platform facing the Clivus Capitolinus, with a row of small rooms or shrines partly cut into the tufa rock of the hill behind. This conjunction of twelve deities was of Etruscan origin; they were six of each sex and were called Senatus Deorum (Varro, L.L ∣ ., viii. 70, and De Re Rusk, i. I). ^[637.] The columns are of cipollino with Corinthian caps; on the frieze is an inscription recording a 'restoration by Vettius Praetextatus, praefect of the city in 367 A.D. Under the marble platform is a row of seven small rooms, the brick facing of which is of the Flavian period, used as offices (schola) for scribes and praecones of the aedilcs. It is usually called the Schola Xanthi from an inscription, now lost, recording its restoration by A. Fabius Xanthus and others, and the erection of seven silver statues of gods (Gruter, Inscr., 170, 3). ^[638. Gli Consenti loro Portico,]

The arch of Severus stands by the rostra, across the road on the north-east side of the Forum; the remains of the ancient travertine curb show that originally the road went along a rather different line, aud was probably altered to make room for this great arch. It was built in 203 a.d., after victories in Parthia, and was originally set up in honour of Severus and his two sons Caracalla (here called M. Aurelius Antoninus) and Geta. Caracalla, after murdering Geta, erased his name from all monuments to his honour in Rome. Representations of the arch on coins of Severus show that its attic was surmounted by a chariot of bronze drawn by six horses, in which stood Severus crowned by Victory; at the sides were statues of Caracalla and Geta, with an equestrian statue at each angle. The arch, except the base, which is of marble-lined travertine, is built of massive blocks of Pentelic marble, and has large crowded reliefs of victories in the East, showing much decadence from the best period of Roman art.

The central space of the Forum is paved with slabs of travertine, much patched at various dates; it appears to have been marked out into compartments with incised lines (see Plate VII.), the use of which is not known. ^[639.] Numerous clamp-holes all over the paving show where statues and other ornaments once stood. The recorded number of these is very great, and they must once have thickly crowded a great part of the central area. Two short marble walls or plutei covered with reliefs, discovered in 1872, stand on the north side. Their use and original position are not known, as the rough travertine plinth on which they have been set is evidently of late date. Each of these marble screens has (on the inside) reliefs of a fat bull, boar, and ram, decked out with sacrificial wreaths and vittae—the Suovetaurilia. On the outside are scenes in the life of Trajan: one has the emperor seated on a suggestus instituting a charity for destitute children in 99 a.d.—a scene shown also in one of his first brasses—with the legendALIM[ENTA] ITALIAE; ^[640.] at the other end the emperor stands on the rostra, on which the two tiers of beaks are shown; he is addressing a crowd of citizens. The backgrounds of this and the other relief are of great topographical interest. In the first is shown the long line of arches of the Basilica Julia, with (on the left) what is probably the temple of Castor and the arch of Augustus. On the right are the statue of Marsyas and the sacred fig-tree (ficus ruminalis), ^[641. (∏.N.,]
[9:20:821]

which stood on the Comitium. On the other slab the emperor is seated on the rostra (this part is broken), while in front a crowd of citizens are bringing tablets and piling them in a heap to be burnt. This records the remission by Trajan of some arrears of debt due to the imperial treasury (Spartian, 7). The background here represents again the Basilica Julia, with (on the right) the Ionic temple of Saturn and the Corinthian temple of Vespasian. Between them is an arch, which may be that of Tiberius. On the left the fig-tree and the statue of Marsyas are repeated. Other explanations of these reliefs have been given, but the above appears the most probable. ^[642. Ann. lnst., Bull. Inst., MarsyasaufdemForum,] Towards the other end of the Forum are remains of a large concrete pedestal. This is usually called the base of the equestrian statue of Domitian (Statius, Silv., i. 22), which stood in front of the Aedes Julii; but its brick facing shows that it is much later than Domitian’s time, and, moreover, Domitian’s statue was destroyed immediately after his death.

The seven cubical brick and concrete structures, once faced with marble, which line the Sacra Via, are not earlier than the time of Constantine. ^[643.] They are probably the pedestals of honorary columns, such as those shown in the relief on Constantine’s arch, mentioned above. The column erected in honour of the tyrant Phocas by Smaragdus in the eleventh year of his exarchate (608) is still standing. It is a fine marble Corinthian column, stolen from some earlier building; it stands on rude steps of marble and tufa. The name of Phocas is erased from the inscription; but the date shows that this monument was to his honour. Remains of other small marble structures are shown in Plate VII., but what they are is not known. In the 4th century a long brick and concrete building faced with marble was built along the whole south-east end of the Forum, probably a row of shops. They were destroyed by Comm. Rosa’s order a few years ago. Countless fragments of other buildings, reliefs, and statues are strewn all over the Forum. Many of these are of great interest; pieces of large granite columns which probably stood on the seven pedestals mentioned above are lying in various places; some of these appear to have been decorated with bronze reliefs, the iron fastenings of which, run with lead, still exist. ^[644.

In addition to the walls of Roma Quadrata (see above), a few remains only now exist earlier in date than the later years of the republic; these are mostly grouped near the Scalae Caci (see No. 11 in fig. 17) and consist of small cellae and other structures of unknown use. ^[645.] They are partly built of the soft tufa used in the wall of Romulus and partly of the hard tufa which resembles peperino. Various names, such as the “hut of Faustulus” and the “Auguratorium,” have been given to these very ancient remains, but with little reason. One thing is certain, that the buildings ιvere respected and preserved even under the empire and were probably regarded as sacred relics of the earliest times. Remains of more than one temple, probably of the early republican period, exist near this ιvest angle of the Palatine; these had peristyles with Tuscan columns of tufa stuccoed and painted. The larger of these (see 14 in fig. 17) has been called Conjecturally the temple of Jupiter Victor (Liv., x. 29; Ov., Fast., iv. 621). It stands on a levelled platform of tufa rock, the Ioiver part of which is excavated into quarry chambers, used in later times as water reservoirs. Two ancient ιvell-shafts lined ιvith tufa communicate ιvith these subterranean IioIIoavs. Another extensive building of hard tufa of the republican period exists in the valley afterwards covered by the Flavian palace; part of this can be seen under the so-called Accademia (21 in fig. 17). Not far from the top of the Scalae Caci are the massive remains of some large cella, nothing of which noιv exists except the concrete core made of alternate layers of tufa and f peperino. It was probably once lined ιvith marble. By it a noble colossal seated figure of a goddess ιvas found, in Greek marble, ιvell modelled, a ιvork of the 1st century a.d. The head and arms are missing, but the figure is probably rightly called a statue of Cybele; and from it her name has been Conjecturally given to this temple. Augustus in the Monumcnturn A ncyranum records AEDEM. MATRIS. MAGNAe . IN . PALATI0 . FECI; but it is more probable that his temple to Cybele formed part of the magnificent group of buildings in the area of Apollo (see below). Some interesting early architectural fragments are lying near this temple; they consist of drums and capitals of Corinthian columns, and part of the cornice of the pediment, cut in peperino, and thickly coated with hard white stucco to imitate marble. Betiveen this and the temple (so called) of Jupiter Victor are extensive remains of a large sort of porticus, with tufa Avails and travertine piers, also republican in date. The use and name of this building are unknown. The temple of Jupiter Stator, traditionally voιved by Romulus during his repulse by the Sabines (Liv., i. 12), stood near the Porta Mugionis, and therefore near the road leading up to the Palatine Sacra A ia. ^[646. Fast., Trist., Polyhist., First Catiline Oration In Cat.,] This has been identified with the ruined concrete podium (40 in fig. 17), the position of which suits the above indications; but the admixture of travertine, brick, and even marble with the tufa of the concrete shoιvs that no trace here remains of any early building. On the tufa blocks of a shaft leading down to a large drain by the side of these remains are incised in large letters—

FILOCRatγ DIOCLe a l -

—possibly the names of Greek stone-masons (Diodes, Philocrates); the form of the letters shows that this inscription is as early as the 2d or even 3d century B. c.

Remains of extensive lines of buildings in early opus reticulatum exist on the upper slopes of the Palatine, all along the Velabrum side, and on the south-west side as far as the so-called Domus Gelotiana. These buildings are constructed on the ruins of the Avail of Romulus, a great part of which has been cut away to make room for them; their base is at the foot of the ancient wall, on the shelf cut midway in the side of the hill; their top reached originally above the upper level of the summit. They are of various dates and cannot be identified with any known buildings. Part is apparently of the time of the emperor Tiberius, and no doubt belongs to the Domus Tiberiana mentioned by Suetonius (Tib., 5; comp. Tac., Hist., i. 27, and iii. 71); this palace covered a great part of the Avest corner of the hill. Of about the same date is a very interesting and well-preserved private house built wholly of opus reticulatum; it is usually called the house of Livia. It has a small atrium, out of which open the triclinium and the tablinum with a room (α∕α) on each side, all handsomely decorated with good paintings of mythological and domestic scenes, probably the work of Greek artists, as inscriptions in Greek occur,— c.g. , EPMHC, under the figure of Hermes, in a picture representing his deliverance of Io from Argus. ^[647. Μon. Inst., Les Peintures du Palatin,] The back part of this house was three stories high, and is divided into a great number of very small rooms, mostly bedrooms. The house is built in a sort of hole against the side of an elevation, so that the upper floor behind is level with an ancient paved road. The dampness caused by this is counteracted and kept off the paintings by a lining of flange-tiles over the external Avails, under the stucco, thus forming an air-cavity all over the surface. From the back of the house, at the upper level, a long subterranean passage leads towards the Flavian palace, and then, turning at right angles and passing by the foundations of the so-called temple of Jupiter Victor, issues in the ancient tufa building mentioned above (20 in fig. 17). Another crypto-porticus starts near this house and communicates with the long semi-subterranean passage by which the palaces of Caligula and Domitian are connected (19 in fig. 17). It is ornamented with very beautiful stucco reliefs of cupids, beasts, and foliage, once painted and gilt. This private house is probably that of Germani-cus, into which the soldiers who killed Caligula in the long crypto-porticus escaped, as described by Josephus (Ant. Jud., xix. 1; see also Suet., Cal., 58). Some inscribed lead pipes were found in this house; some pieces bear the inscription IVLIAE . AVG., probably the daughter of Titus.

The palace of Augustus and the Area Apollinis ^[648. Bull. Comm. Arch. Roma,] occupied a great portion of the central part of the Palatine (see 47 and 48 in fig. 17); the splendour of its architecture and the countless works of art in gold, silver, ivory, bronze, and marble, mostly the production of the best Greek artists, which adorned this magnificent group of buildings must have made it the chief glory of this splendid city. It was approached from a road leading out of the Summa Sacra Via along the line of the present Via di S. Bonaven-tura; the entrance, probably the Arcus of Pliny (H.N., xxxvi. 4, 10), led through lofty propylaea into a very extensive peristyle or porticus, with (at least) fifty-two fluted columns of Numidian giallo; the rest was of white Luna and Athenian marble. In the centre of this enclosure stood the great octostyle peripteral temple of Apollo Palatinus, so called to distinguish it from another temple of Apollo outside the Porta Carmentalis, remains of which exist

Paris, 1870. . ,
[9:20:822]

under the Albergo di Catena near the Piazza Montanara. This temple was begun by Augustus in 36 ιs.c., ^[649. Templvm . Apollinis . in . solo . magnam . partem . Mon. Ancyr.).] after his Sicilian victory over Sextus Pompeius, and finished in 28 B. c. ^[650.] A glowing account of the splendours of these buildings is given by Propertius {El., ii. 3). Inside the cella were statues of Apollo between Latona and Diana by Scopas, Praxiteles, and Timotheus respectively (Plin., H.N^., xxxvi. 4); round the walls were statues of the nine Muses (Juv., vii. 37). The pediment had sculpture by Bupalus and Arehermus of Chios (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 4), and on the apex was Apollo in a quadriga of gilt bronze. The double door was covered with ivory reliefs of the death of the Niobids and the defeat of the Gauls at Delphi. The Ancyra inscription records that Augustus sold eighty silver statues of himself and with the money “offered golden gifts” to this temple, dedicating them both in his own name and in the names of the original donors of the statues. ^[651. Aug.,] The Sibylline books were preserved under the statue of Apollo (Suet., Axιg., 31); and within the cella were vases, tripods, and statues of gold and silver, with a collection of engraved gems dedicated by Marcellus (see Plin., H.N., xxxvii. 5). On each side of the porticus was a large library, one Latin and the other Greek; ^[652. Αug.,] and a third side of the great enclosure was occupied by a large hall where the Senate Occasionallymet (Tac., Ann., ii. 37), in the centre [9:20:823]of which stood a bronze colossus of Augustus, ^[653.] 50 feet high (Plin., H.N., xxxiv. 18). Round the porticus, between the Numidian marble columns, were statues of the fifty Danaids, and opposite them their fifty bridegrooms on horseback (see schol. on Pers., ii. 56), many fragments of which have been found. In the centre before the steps of the temple stood an altar surrounded by four oxen, the work of Myron (Proper., El., ii. 3, 7). Within the same area was a small temple of Vesta (C , .7.A., i. p. 392), dedicated on 28th April 12 b.c., when Augustus was elected pontifex maximus; ^[654. (Task, Metam., Vat., Bulk Comm. Arch. Roma,] the sacred block or altar symbolically called Roma Quadrata, surrounded by a circular trench called the Mundus, was also in some part of this great group of buildings. On the side towards the Circus Maximus was the palace of Augustus, which was excavated in 1775, and drawings of which were published by Guattani. ^[655. Mori. Ant. ined. di Roma,] A great part shown by him has since then been destroyed, and all is now concealed; the plan (48 in fig. 17) is taken from Guattani. The whole group is described by Ovid {Trist., iii. 1). Augustus also rebuilt the temple of Victory, ^[656. Roman Medallions,] which gave its name to the Clivus A r ictoriffi; this temple stood on the site of a prehistoric altar (Dionys., i. 32), and was more than once rebuilt,—e.<∕., by L. Postumius, 294 b.c. (Liv., x. 33). In 193 b.c. an aedicula to ATctory was built near it by Porcius Cato (Liv., xxxv. 9). Remains of the temple and a dedicatory inscription were found in 1725-28 ^[657. Pak dei Cesark] not far from the church of S. Maria Libératrice; the temple was of Parian marble, with Corinthian columns of Numidian giallo antico. The Area Apollinis and its group of buildings suffered in the fire of Nero, and were restored by Domitian. The whole was finally destroyed in the great fire of 363 (Ammian, xxiii. 3), but the Sibylline books were saved.

The palace of Caligula occupies the northern angle of the Palatine, and extends over the Clivus Victorhe a long way towards the Clivus Palatinus (see fig. 17). This part of the Palatine was once occupied by the Lucus Vestae, with the Sacellum Volrlpiae and many fine private houses. Among these were the dwellings of Q. Lutatius Catulus, Q. Hortensius, Catiline, Scaurus, Crassus (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 3, 24), whose house was afterwards bought by Cicero, ^[658. Pro Domo, ffandb.,] and the house of Clodius, the view of which Cicero threatened to block out. ^[659. De Harvs.,] Many other wealthy Romans had houses on this part of the Palatine, so that the cost of the site for Caligula’s enormous palace must have been very great. The part now existing is little more than the gigantic substructures built to raise the principal rooms to the level of the top of the hill. The lowest parts of these face the Nova A r ia, opposite the Atrium A τ este, and many stories of small vaulted rooms built in mixed brick and opus reticulatum rise one above the other to the higher levels. ^[660.] The palace extends over the Clivus Victoriae, supported on lofty arches so as to leave the road unblocked; many travertine or marble stairs lead to the upper rooms, some starting from the Nova Via, others from the Clivus Victoriae. Its enormous extent is referred to by Pliny {H. N., xxxvi. 24). A large proportion of these substructures consist of dark rooms, some with no means of lighting, others with scanty borrowed light. AIany small rooms and stairs scarcely 2 feet wide can only have been used by slaves. The ground floors on the Nova ATa and the Clivus ATctorise appear to have been shops, judging from their wide openings, with travertine sills, grooved for the wooden fronts with narrow doors, which Roman shops seem always to have had,—very like those now used in the East. The upper and j>rincipal rooms were once richly decorated with marble linings, columns, and mosaics; but little of these now remains. By the side of the Clivus Victoriae still exists the start of the bridge by which Caligula joined the Capitolium to the Palatium (Suet., Cal., 22); it is partly supported on corbelled arches, richly decorated with delicate stucco reliefs; the floor is of mosaic, and a piece of the open marble screen or balustrade is still in situ. The intermediate parts of Caligula’s bridge were removed after his death, and the exit from the palace is blocked by a brick-faced wall, very little later in date than the palace itself. Near the bridge are some rooms very handsomely ornamented with a combination of coloured stucco reliefs and painting on the flat. The upper part of the palace, that above the Clivus Victoriae, is faced wholly with brickwork, no opus reticulatum being used, as in the lower portions by the

Nova Via. This possibly marks a difference of date, and the occurrence of brick stamps of the latter part of the 1st century A.D. in various parts of the palace shows that a large portion of it is later than the time of Caligula.

The next great addition to the buildings of the Palatine was the magnificent suite of state apartments built by Domitian, over a deep natural valley running across the hill (see fig. 17). The valley was filled up. and the level of the new palace raised to a considerable height above the natural soil. Remains of a house, decorated with painting and rich marbles, exist under Domitian’s peristyle, partly destroyed by the foundations of cast concrete which cut right through it. The floor of this house shows the original level, far below that of the Flavian palace. The south angle of this great building adjoins the palace of Augustus, and it is connected with the palace of Caligula by a branch subterranean passage leading into the earlier crypto-porticus. These two buildings continued to be used as the private apartments of the emperor, the Flavian block consisting only of state rooms; the words AEDES PVBLICA were inscribed upon it by Nerva to show its public character. It consists of a large open peristyle, with columns of Oriental marble, at one end of which is the grand triclinium with magnificent paving of opus sectile in red and green basalt and coloured marbles, a piece of which is well preserved; next to the triclinium, on to which it opens with large windows, is a nymphaeum or room with marble-lined fountain and recesses for plants and statues. On the opposite side of the peristyle is a large throne-room, the walls of which were adorned with rows of pavonazetto and giallo columns and large marble niches, in which were colossal statues of porphyry and basalt; at one side of this is the basilica, with central nave and apse and narrow aisles, over which were galleries. The apse, in which was the emperor’s throne, is screened off by open marble cancelli, a part of which still exists. It is of great interest as showing the origin of the Christian basilica; S. Agnese fuori Ie AIura is exactly similar in arrangement (see Basilica, vol. iii. p. 417). ^[661.] On the other side of the throne-room is the Iararium, with altar and pedestal for a statue; next to this is the grand staircase, which led to the upper rooms, now destroyed. The whole building, both floor and walls, was covered with the richest Oriental marbles, including all the varieties mentioned on p. 808. Outside were colonnades or porticus,—on one side of cipollino, on the other of travertine, the latter stuccoed and painted. The magnificence of the whole, crowded with fine Greek sculpture and covered with polished marbles of the most brilliant colours, is difficult now to realize; a glowing description is given by Statius {Silv., iv. 11, 18; see also Plut., Poplie., 15, and AIart., viii. 36). Doors were arranged in the throne-room and basilica so that the emperor could slip out unobserved and reach by a staircase (30 in fig. 17) the crypto-porticus which communicates with Caligula’s palace. The vault of this passage was covered with mosaic of mixed marble and glass, a few fragments of which still remain; its walls were lined with rich marbles; it was lighted by a series of windows in the springing of the vault. This, as well as the Flavian palace, appears to have suffered more than once from fire, and in many places important restorations of the time of Severus, and some as late as the 4th century, are evident. In 1720-26 extensive excavations were made here for the Farnese duke of Parma, and an immense quantity of statues and marble architectural fragments were discovered, many of which are now at Naples and elsewhere. Among them were sixteen beautiful fluted columns of pavonazetto and giallo, fragments of the porphyry statues, and an immense door-sill of Pentelic marble, now used for the high altar of the Pantheon; these all came from the throne-room. The excavations were carried on by Bianchini, who published a book on the subject. ^[662. Pal. dei Cesark di Antieli.,]

In the middle of the slopes of the Palatine, towards the Circus AIaximus, are considerable remains of buildings set against the wall of Romulus and covering one of its projecting spurs. This series of rooms with a long Corinthian colonnade has been supposed to be part of the Domus Gelotiana, from which Caligula used to watch the races in the circus below (Suet., Cad., 18). Little, however, of the existing remains is as early as the reign of Caligula, and the marble porticus apparently dates from the time of Severus. The rooms were partly marble-lined and partly decorated with painted stucco, on which are incised a number of interesting inscriptions and rude drawTngs. Here, in 1857, was found the celebrated (so-called) caricature of the Crucified Christ, now in the Aluseo Kircheriano, but which, more probably, has a Gnostic meaning. ^[663. Das Spottcrucifix vom Palatin, Das Spottcrucifix, &c.,] The inscriptionC0RINTHVS . EXIT . DE . PEDAGOGIO suggests that this building was at one time used as a school, perhaps for the imperial slaves. A number of soldiers’ names also occur, c.g., HILARVS. Ml. V. D. N. (Hilarus miles veteranus domini nostri); some are in mixed Latin and Greek characters, with many [9:20:824]varieties of mis-spelling. After one pair of names is inscribed PEREG, showing that they belonged to the foreign corps called Peregriui, probably stationed here as guards to the imperial residences on the hill above. Most of these inscriptions appear to be as early as the 1st century a. D. ^[664. Bull. Inst.,] These interesting graffiti have in great part perished during the last few years, and soon none will remain.

. The great stadium of the Palatine (see 50 in fig. 17) was begun by Domitian, mainly built by Hadrian, and much altered or restored by Severus. The greater part of the outer walls and the large exedra or apse at the side, with upper floor for the emperor’s seat, are of the time of Hadiian, as is shown by the brick stamps, and the character of the brick facing, which much resembles that of the Flavian time (bricks 1⅜ inches and joints ⅜ inch thick). ^[665.] The stadium is surrounded with a colonnade of engaged shafts, forming a sort of aisle with gallery over it. Except those at the curved end, which are of Hadrian’s time, these piers are of the time of Severus, as are also all the flat piers along the outer wall,—one opposite each of those in the inner line. This shows either that the stadium must have been left by Hadrian in an unfinished state, or else that it Siiftered seriously from a fire or earthquake before the reign of Severus.

> In addition to the stadium, Hadrian built a number of very handsome rooms, forming a palace on the south-east side and at the south-west end of the stadium. These rooms were partly destroyed and partly hidden by the later palace of Severus, the foundations of which in many places cut through and render useless the highly decorated rooms of Hadrian (53 in fig. 17). The finest of these which is now visible is a room with a large window opening into the stadium near the south angle; it lias intersecting barrel vaults, with deep coffers, richly ornamented in stucco. The oval structure shown in the plan (50 in fig. 17), with other still later additions, belongs to the 4th or 5th century, when the stadium was no longer used for races; some of the walls, of opus mixtum, which cut up and disfigure this noble building appear to be the work of Theodoric, c. 500.

The palace of Septiniius Severus was very extensive and of enormous height; it extends not only all over the south angle of the Palatine but also a long way into the valley of the Circus Maximus and towards the Coelian. This part (like Caligula’s palace) is carried on very lofty arched substructures, so as to form a level, uniform with the top of the hill, on which the grand apartments stood. The whole height from the base of the Palatine to several stories above its summit must have been enormous. Little now remains of the highest stories, except part of a grand staircase which led to them. Extensive baths, all richly decorated with marble linings and mosaics in glass and marble, cover a great part of the top of the hill. These and other parts of the Palatine were supplied with water by an aqueduct built by Nero in continuation of the Claudian aqueduct, some arches of which still exist on the slope of the Palatine (56 in fig. 17; see Spart., Sept. Sev., 24). The palace of Severus was restored and enlarged by Heliogabalus and Sevems Alexander. ^[666. Hist. Augn Sept. Sev., Sev. Alex., Helwg.,] One of the main roads up to the Palatine passes under the arched substructures of Severus, and near this, at the foot of the hill, at the south angle, Septimius Severus built an outlying part of his palace, a building of great splendour dedicated to the Sun and Moon, called the Septizonium, probably from its seven stories or zonae (see Jordan, Bull. Inst., 1872, p. 145). It has been doubted whether it can really have been as much as seven stories high; but this is not improbable when we consider the enormous height of the rest of Severus’s palace, reaching from the foot of the Palatine to far above its summit. Part of the Septi-zonium existed as late as the reign of Sixtus V. (1585-90), who destroyed it in order to use its marble decorations and columns in the new basilica of St Peter; drawings of it are given by Du Perac, Vestigj di Roma, 1575, and in other works of that century. ^[667. Koiseipal. in Bam, Pal. dei Cesari, Guida del Pcd., Ann. Inst., Mon. Inst., Boma desc.,]

The Velia and Germalns were two outlying spurs of the Palatine. ^[668. L-L.,] Owing to the great alterations that have been made in the contour of the hill it is now very difficult to identify these ancient districts (see Aim. Inst., 1865, p. 347). The Germalus or Cermalus was probably on the side towards the Velabrum, while the Velia may be identified with that elevated ground between the Palatine and the Esquiline on which the temple of Venus and Rome and the arch of Titus now stand. It is evident that this was once much loftier and more abrupt than it is now; a great part of it was cut away when the level platform for the temple of Venus and Rome was formed. The foundations of part of Nero’s palace aloug the road between this temple and the Esquiline are exposed for about 20 to 30 feet in height, showing a corresponding lowering of the level here, and the bare tufa rock, cut to a flat surface, is visible on the site of Hadrian’s great temple; that the Velia was once much loftier is also indicated by the story of the removal of Valerius Publicola’s dwelling. ^[669. Reρ., Ad Cic. In Pis.,]

On the Velia and the adjoining Summa Sacra Via were twe temples which Augustus rebuilt. ^[670. (Mon. Aneyrg.] The “Aedes Larum” is probably the “Sacellum Larum” mentioned by Tacitus (Aim., xii. 24) as one of the points in the line of the pomoerium of Roma Quadrata. The Sacra Via started at the Sacellum Streniae, an unknown point on the Esquiline, probably near the baths of Titus (Varro, A.A. l v. 47), in the quarter called Cerolia. Thence it probably (in Iatei times) Jiassed round part of the Colosseum to the slope leading uj to the arch of Titus on the Velia; this piece of its course is lined on one side by extensive baths, attributed to Heliogabalus (45 in fig. 17), and farther back, against the cliff of the Palatine, arc remains of Nero’s enormous palace (see 42 in fig. 17). From the arch of Titus or Summa Sacra Via the original line of the road has been altered (see Plate Λ'II.); the angle at which the scanty remains of the Regia are set probably shows the early direction of the Sacra A ia in passing on to the temple of Vesta. Its later course was more to the north-east, passing at a sharp angle from the arch oi Titus to the front of Constantine’s basilica, and on past the temple of Faustina. It is uncertain whether the continuation of this road to the arch of Severus was in later times called the Sacra Via oi whether it rejoined its old line along the Basilica Julia by the cross-road in front of the Aedes Jiilii. Its original line past the temple of Vesta was completely built over in the 3d and 4th centuries, anti clumsily-fitted pavements of marble and travertine occupy the place of the old basalt blocks. ^[671. Soera Via, Topographie der Stadt born,] The course of the Nova Via ^[672. Not. d. Scavt,] (see figs; 16 and 17) along the palace of Caligula ^[673.] was exposetl in 1882-84. According to Varro (A.A., vi. 59) it was a very old road. It led up from the Velabrum, probably winding along the slope of the Palatine, round the north angle under the church of S. Maria Libératrice. The rest of its course, gently ascending towards the arch of Titus, is now exposed, as are also the stairs, possibly the Seake Anulariae, which connected it with the Clivus A ictoriae at the Porta Romanula; a continuation of these stairs, still unexcavated, Ieel down to the Forum. ^[674. Past.,]

The extent of the once marshy. Velabrum (Gk., Fl ∖ os) is not known, though part of its site is indicated by the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro; Varro (Z.A., vi. 24) says, “extra ιιrbeιn an-tiquam fuit, non longe a porta Romanula.” It was a district full of shops (Plaut., Capk, iii. 1, 29; Hor., Sak, ii. 3, 229). The A icus Tuscus on its course from the Forum to the Circus skirted the A r elabrum (Dionys., v. 26), from which the goldsmiths’ arch was an entrance into the Forum Boarium (comp. Dionys., i. 40).

Cnpitoline Hill.

The Capitoline Hill, once called Mons Satumius (Varro, L. L., v. 42), consists of two peaks, the Capitolium and the Arx, ^[675.] with an intermediate valley (Asylum). The older name of the Capi-tolium was Mons Tarpeius (Varro, L. L., v. 41). Livy (i. 10) mentions the founding of a shrine to Jupiter Feretrius on the Capitolium by Romulus; ^[676.] this summit was afterwards occupied by the great triple temple dedicated to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, a triad of deities worshipped under the names of Tinia, Thalna, and Menrva in every Etruscau city. This great temple was (Liv., i. 38, 53) founded by Tarquin L, built by his son Tarquin IL, and dedicated by M. Horatius Pulvillus, consul suffectus in 509B.C. ^[677. PuM., I. L.,] It was built in the Etruscan style, of peperino stuccoed and painted (A τ itr., iii. 3), with wooden architraves, wide Intercoluniniations, and painted terra-cotta statues. ^[678. Hist.,] It was rebuilt many times; the original temple lasted till it was burnt in 83 b.c.; it was then refounded in marble' by Sulla, with Corinthian columns stolen from the temple of Olympian Zeus in Athens (Plin., xxxvi. 5), and was completed and dedicated by Q. Lut. Catulus, whose name appeared on the front. Augustus, in spite of his having carried out part of the work, did not introduce his name by the side of that of Catulus. It was again burnt by the ATtellian rioters in 70 a.d., and rebuilt by A’espasian in 71. ^[679. Vit., Ves., Hist.,] Lastly, it was burnt in the three days’ fire probably in Roma Quadrata the usual triply consecrated temple erected at the founding of the city. It was rebuilt by Augustus, as is recorded in the Mon. Aneyr.
[9:20:825]

of Titus’s reign ^[680. Dom.,] and rebuilt with columns of Pentelic marble by Domitian; the gilding alone of this last rebuilding is said to have cost 2⅜ millions sterling (Plut., Publ., 15). There has been much controveι - sy as to the site of this temple and that of Juno Moneta on the Arx; but there is an overwhelming mass of evidence to show that the Capitolium is the peak where the Palazzo Caflarelli stands, and that the church of Ara Cceli occupies the Arx. Livy (xxxv. 21) mentions the fall of a mass of rock from the Capitolium into the Vicus Jugarius, which passes close under the Caffarelli summit, ami is not near the opposite peak. Moreover, extensive substructions of tufa and peperino have been exposed on the eastern peak, the form of which appears to fit this nearly square triple temple, and in 1875 a fragment of a fluted column was found, of such great size that it could only have belonged to the temple of Jupiter. Its actual limits have not been clearly made out, and therefore the truth of Dionysius’s description (iv. 61) cannot be proved. ^[681. Hulk Comm. Αrch., Mon. Inst., Abhandk der Herl. Akad., Röm. Gesch., Gesch., Handb., Ann. Inst.,] The temple is represented on many coins, both republican and imperial; these show that the central cella was that of Jupiter, that of Minerva on his right, and of Juno on his left. The door was covered with gold reliefs, which were stolen by Stilicho (c. 390; Zosim., v. 38), and the gilt bronze tiles (Plin., xxxiii. 18) on the roof were partly stripped off by Genseric in 455 (Procop., De Belk Vanrl., i. 5), and the rest by Pope Honorius I. in 630 (Marliano, Topogr., ii. 1). Till 1348, when the steps up to Ara Cceliwere built, there was no access to the Capitol from the back; hence the three ascents to it mentioned by Livy (iii. 7, v. 26-28) and Tacitus OHisk, iii. 71-72) were all from the inside of the Servian circuit. Even on this inner side it was defended by a wall, the gates in which are called ‘ i Capitolii fores” by Tacitus. Part of the outer wall at the top of the tufa rock, which is cut into a smooth cliff, is visible from the modern Vicolo della Rupe Tarpeia; this cliff is traditionally called the Tarpeian rock, but that must have been on the other side towards the Forum, from whence it was visible, as is clearly stated by Dionysius (vii. 35, viii. 78). ^[682. La roche Tarpienne, Eleg.,] Another piece of the ancient wall has recently been exposed, about half-way up the slope from the Forum to the Arx. It is built of soft yellow tufa blocks, five courses of which still remain in the existing fragment. The large temple of Juno Moneta (“the Adviser”) on the Arx, built by Camillus in 384 b.c., was used as the mint; hence monxta = “money” (Liv., vi. 20).

A large number of other temples and smaller shrines stood on the Capitoline Hill, a word used broadly to include both the Capitolium and the Arx. ^[683. Notifia,] Among these were the temple of Honos and Virtus, built by Marius, and the temple of Fides, founded by Numa, and rebuilt during the First Punic War. Both these were large enough to hold meetings of the Senate. The temple of Jupiter Tonans ^[684. (Bulk Comm. Arch. Rom,, Mon. Ancyr.] was built by Augustus (Suet., Aug., 29), near the great temple of Jupiter. Other shrines existed to Venus Victrix, Ops, Jupiter Custos, and Concord—the last under the Arx (Liv., xxii. 33)—and many others, as well as a triumphal arch in honour of Nero, and a crowd of statues and other works of art (see Plin., H.H., xxxiii. 4; xxxiv. 17, 18, 19; xxxv. 36, 45; xxxvi. 5, 8), so that the whole hill must have been a mass of architectural and artistic magnificence, the spoils of the whole Hellenic world.

The so-called Tabularium occupies the central part of the side towards the Forum; it is set on the tufa rock, which is cut away to receive its lower story. It derives its name from an inscription found there in the 15th century, quoted by Poggio (see Gruter, Dιscr., 170, 6); but that name was given to many buildings in Rome (Liv., iii. 55, xliii. 16), and there is no reason to suppose that this specially was known as the Tabularium (comp. Virg., Geor., ii. 501). Catulus, who was also the dedicator of the great temple of Jupiter (Tac., Hisk, iii. 72; Dion Cass., xliii. 14), was consul in 78 b.c., but part of this building is probably much earlier in date. Its outer walls are of peperino, its inner ones of tufa or concrete; the Doric arcade has capitals and architrave of travertine. ^[685.] A road paved with basalt passes through the building along this arcade, entered at one end from the Clivus Capitolinus, and at the other probably from the Gradus Monetae, a flight of steps leading from the temple of Concord and the Forum up to the temple of Juno Moneta on the Arx (see Plate VII.). The entrance from the Clivus Capitolinus is by a wide flat arch of peperino most beautifully jointed; the other end wall has been mostly destroyed. The back of this building overlooked the Asylum or depression between the two peaks. From this higher level a long steep staircase of sixty-four steps descends towards the Forum; the doorway at the foot of these stairs has a flat arch, with a circular relieving arch over it; it was completely blocked up by the temple of Vespasian (see fig. 1). This was probably the door where the Vitellian rioters broke into the Capitolium (Tac., HiM., iii. 71). ^[686. (Ann. Inst., 1⅞58, ante,] Great damage was done to this building by the additions of Boniface VIIL and Nicholas V., as well as by its being used as a salt store, by which the walls were much corroded. ^[687. del Campidoglio, Antico Tabulario, Capitolio Romano, Ann. Inst.,] The Imperial Fora.

The Forum Julium (see fig. 18), with its central temple of Venus Genitrix, was begun in 49 B.c. after the battle of Rharsalia bj> Julius and completed by Augustus. ^[688. Mon. Ancyr. Π.N.,] Being built on a crowded site it was somewhat cramped, and the ground cost nearly a hundred million sesterces. ^[689. Ep. ad Atk, Caes.,] Part of its circuit wall, with remains of five arches, exists in the Via Marmorella; and behind is a row of small vaulted rooms, probably shops or offices. ^[690.] The arches are flat, slightly cambered, with travertine springers and keys; the rest, with the circular relieving arch over, is of tufa; it was once lined with slabs of marble, the holes for which exist. Foundations of the circuit wall exist under the houses towards S. Adriano, but the whole plan has not been made out. Palladio {Areh., iv. 31) describes excavations made here, and the discovery of remains of a fine temple, probably that of Venus Genitrix. ^[691. Belk Civ., Caes.,]

The forum of Augustus (see fig. 18) adjoined that of Julius on its north-east side; it contains the temple of Mars Ultor, built to commemorate the vengeance taken on Caesar’s murderers at Philippi, 42 B.c. (0v., Fast., v. 575 sg , .). ^[692. Aug.,] It was surrounded with a massive [9:20:826]wall of peperino, nearly 100 feet lιιglι, with travertine string-courses and cornice; a large piece of this wall still exists, and is one of the most imposing relics of ancient Rome. Against it are remains of the temple of Mars, three columns of which, with their entablature and marble ceiling of the peristyle, are still standing; it is Corinthian in style, very richly decorated, and built of tine Luna marble. The cella is of peperino, lined with marble; and the lower part of the lofty circuit wall seems also to have been lined with marble on the inside of the forum. The large archway by the temple (Arco dei Γantani) is of travertine. PaTladio [Arch., iv.) and other writers of the 16th century give plans of the temple and circuit wall, showing much more than now exists. The temple, which was octastyle, with nine columns and a pilaster on the sides, occupied the centre, and on each side the circuit wall formed two large semicircular apses, decorated with tiers of niches for statues. ^[693. Foro ΛAugusto,]

The Forum Pacis, built by Vespasian, was farther to the southeast; the only existing piece, a massive and lofty wall of mixed tufa and peperino, with a travertine archway, is opposite the end of the basilica of Constantine. The arch opened into what was probably the Templum Sacrae Urbis, which contained a plan of the city of Rome. The original plan was probably burnt with the whole group of buildings in this forum in 191, in the reign of Coni-niodus (Dion Cass., Ixxii. 24); but a new plan engraved on marble was made, and the building restored in concrete and brick by Severus. The north-east end wall, with the clamps for fixing the marble plan, still exists, as does also the other (restored) end wall with its arched windows towards the forum (see fig. 19); one

I

hundred and sixty-seven fragments of this plan were found c. 1560 at the foot of the wall to which they were fixed, and are now preserved in the Capitoline Museum; drawings of the seventy-four pieces now lost are preserved in the Vatican ^[694. Roma Αnt.,] [Cod. Vat., 3439). The whole has been published in a valuable work by Professor Jordan, Forma Urbis Romae, Berlin, 1875-82. The fragments which relate to the Forum Magnum are given on Plate VIL The circular building at the end facing on the Sacra Via is an addition built by Maxentius in honour of his deified son Romulus; like the other buildings of Maxentius, it was rededicated and inscribed with the name of his conqueror Constantine. ^[695. Bull. Crist., Ann. Inst., Bull. Comnι. Arch. Rom., Cod. Vat., (Vestigj)] The original stone building of Vespasian was probably an archive and record office; the name Templum Sacrae Urbis is with much probability given to it by Jordan, partly on the authority of an inscription now in the Vatican (see Forma Urbis Romae). The fine bronze doors at the entrance to the temple of Romulus are much earlier than the building itself, as are also the porphyry columns and very rich entablature which ornament this doorway. Pope Felix IV. (526-530)

made the double building into the church of SS. Cosmo e Damiano, using the circular domed temple of Romulus as a porch. ^[696. Vita S. Felicis IV.),—] The chief building of Vespasian’s forum was the Templum Pacis, ^[697. Bell. Goth.,] dedicated in 75, one of the most magnificent in Rome, which contained a very large collection of works of art.

The forum of Nerva (see fig. 18) occupied the narrow strip left between the fora of Augustus and Vespasian; being little more than a richly decorated street, it was called the Forum Transitorium or Forum Palladium, from the temple to Minerva which it contained. It was begun by Domitian, and dedicated by Nerva in 97 (see Suet., Dom., 5; Mart., Ep., i. 2, 8). Like the other imperial fora, it was surrounded by a peperino wall, not only lined with marble but also decorated with rows of Corinthian columns supporting a rich entablature with sculptured frieze. Two columns and part of this wall still exist; on the frieze are reliefs of weaving, fulling, and various arts which were under the protection of Minerva. A great part of the temple existed till the time of Paul V., who in 1606 destroyed it to use the Columnselsewhere. ^[698. (Arch.,] In the reign of Severus Alexander a series of colossal bronze statues, some equestrian, were set round this forum; they represented all the previous emperors who had been deified, and by each was a bronze column inscribed with his “res gestae” (Lamprid., Hist. Aug.: Seυ. Alex., 28).

The forum of Trajan with its adjacent buildings was the last and, at least in size, the most magnificent of all; it was in progress from 100 to 117. A great spur of hill, which connected the Capitoline with the Quirinal, was cut away to make a level site for this enormous group of buildings. It consisted (see fig. 20) of a large dipteral peristyle, with curved projections, lined with shops on the side. That against the slope of the Quirinal, three stories high, still partly exists. The main entrance was through a triumphal arch (Dion Cass., Ixviii. 29), from which probably were taken most of the fine reliefs used by Constantine to decorate his arch. Aurci of Trajan show this arch and other parts of his forum. ^[699.] The opposite [9:20:827]side was occupied by the Basilica Ulpia (Jordan, For. Ur. Rom.'), part of which, with the column of Trajan, is now visible; none of the columns, which are of grey granite, are in situ, and the whole restoration is misleading. Part of the rich paving in Oriental marble is genuine. This basilica contained two large libraries (Dion Cass., Ixviii. 16; Aul. Gell., xi. 17).

The Columna Cochlis (so called from its spiral stairs) is, including capital and base, 97 feet 9 inches high, ^[700. Suοlο di Roma, Ηandb.,] ix., IOO Roman feet; its pedestal has reliefs of trophies of Dacian arms, and winged Victories, with an inscription recording the enormous mass of Iiill which was removed to form the site (comp. Dion Cass., Ixviii. 16). On the shaft are reliefs arranged spirally in twenty-three tiers, scenes of Trajan’s victories, containing about 2500 figures. Trajan’s ashes were buried in a gold urn under this column (Dion Cass., Ixviii. 16); and on the summit was a colossal gilt bronze statue of the emperor, now replaced by a poor figure of St Peter, set there by Sixtus V. ^[701. Columna Trajana Cok Traj. designata.] Beyond the column stood the temple of Trajan . completed by Hadrian; its foundations exist under the buildings at the north-east side of the modern piazza, and many of its granite columns have been found. This temple is shown on coins of Hadrian. ^[702. Hist. Aug.: Hadr.,] The architect of this magnificent group of buildings was Apollodorus of Damascus (Dion Cass., Ixix. 4), who also designed many buildings in Rome during Hadrian’s reign. ^[703. Foro Trajano, Ristauro del Foro Trajano, Cok Trajana, Cok Trajana, La Colonne Trajane,] In addition to the five imperial fora, and the Forum AIagnum, Olitorium, and Boarium, mentioned above, there were also smaller markets for pigs (Forum Suarium), bread (Forum Pistorium), and fish (Forum Piscarium), all of which, with some others, popularly but wrongly called fora, are given in the regionary catalogues.

Other Temples, Ac.

Besides the temples mentioned in previous sections remains of many others still exist in Rome. The circular temple by the Tiber in the Forum Boarium, formerly thought to be that of Vesta, may be the temple of Hercules mentioned by AIacrobius {Saturn., iii. 6), Solinus {Colled., i. 11), and Livy (x. 23). Its design is similar to that of the temple of Vesta in the Forum (fig. 15), and, except the entablature and upper part of the cella, which are gone, it is well preserved (see Piale, Tempiodi Vesta, 1817). The neighbouring Ionic temple, popularly called of Fortuna Virilis, is of special interest from its early date, probably the end of the 2d century b.c. The complete absence of marble and the very sparing use of travertine, combined with the simple purity of its design, are all proofs of its great antiquity. It has a prostyle tetrastyle portico of travertine, and a short cella of tufa with engaged columns; the bases of these and of the angle columns are of travertine. The frieze has reliefs of ox skulls and garlands. The whole was originally stuccoed and painted so that the different stones used would not show. Fig. 21

gives the plan, showing the hard travertine used at the points of greatest pressure, while the main walls with the half columns are of the weaker and softer tufa. The dedication of this temple is doubtful; on the whole it appears most probable that it is the temple to Fortuna (without any affix) founded by Servius Tullius (Dionys., iv. 27) in the Forum Boarium, not the one to Τύχη , λv5ρeια (Fors Fortuna ?) mentioned as being by the river (comp. Plut., De Fork Rom., 5). Ten columns of what is probably the temple of Ceres, Liber, and Libera exist wι∙ situ, built up in the end and side walls of the church of S. AIaria in Cosmedin. These have well sculptured composite capitals and wide Intercolumniation,—probably a survival of the original design of this temple, which was Tuscan in style (Vitr., iii. 3, 5; Plin., H.N., XXXV. 45). Itwas founded by Aulus Postumius, dictator in 497 b.c., and dedicated by Spurius Cassius, consul in 494 B. C.

(Dionys,, vi. 17, 94). In 31 B.C. it was burnt (Dion Cass., 1. 10), and was rebuilt by Augustus and Tiberius (Tac., Ann., ii. 49); but the existing columns belong to a still later restoration. The temple stands close to the carceres of the Circus AIaximus, in the Forum Boarium. Within the walls of S. Niccolo in Carcere (see fig. 22) in the Forum Olitorium are preserved remains of the tufa cellae and travertine columns of three small hexastyle peripteral temples, two Ionic and one Tuscan, set close side by side. ^[704. Ann. Inst., Μon. Inst., Architettura,] A fragment of the marble plan in cludes part of this group, as is indi cated on fig. 22.

Two of these temples were pro bably those to

Spes and Juno

Sospita (Liv.,xxi.

62, xxxii. 30); the third may be that of Apollo AIedicus

(Liv., xl. 51), as suggested by

Burn {Rome mid Campagna, 1871, note i. p. 306).

Near the Fomm

Olitorium, in the]

modern Ghetto, are extensive re mains of the large group of buildings included in the Porticus Octaviae, two of which, dedicated to Juno Regina and Jupiter Stator, with part of the enclosing porticus and the adjoining temple of Hercules AIusarum, are shown on a fragment of the marble plan. The Porticus Octaviae, a large rectangular space enclosed by a double line of columns, was built in honour of Octavia by her brother Augustus on the site of the Porticus AIetelli, founded in 146 b.c. This must not be confounded with the neighbouring Porticus Octavia founded by Cn. Octavius, the conqueror of Perseus (Liv., xlv. 6, 42), in 168 B.c., and rebuilt under the same name by Augustus, as is recorded in the Ancyraean inscription. The whole group was one of the most magnificent in Rome, and contained a large number of works of art by Phidias and other Greek sculptors. The existing portico, which was the main entrance into the porticus, is a restoration of the time of Severus in 203. The church of S. AIichele and the houses behind it conceal extensive remains of the porticus and its temples (see Ann. Inst., 1868, p. 108; and Contigliozzi, I Portixidi Ottavia, 1861). ^[705.]

Remains of a large peripteral Corinthian temple are built into the side of the “Dogana di Terra,” near AIonteCitorio. Eleven marble columns and their rich entablature are still in situ, with the corresponding part of the cella wall of peperino; in 1878 a piece of the end wall of the cella was discovered, and, under the houses near, part of a large peribolus wall, also of peperino, forming an enclosure with columns all round the temple nearly 330 feet square (see Bull. Comm. Arch. Rom., vL, pi. iv., 1878). The dedication of this temple is not known; it has commonly been identified with the temple of Neptune (Dion Cass., Ixvi. 24), built by Agrippa, and surrounded by the Porticus Argonautarum (Dion Cass., Iiii. 27; AIart. iii. 20, 11); but its details appear to be later than the reign of Augustus. ^[706.] Another not improbable theory is that it was the temple of Hadrian, mentioned in the Mirabilia (Uhlrichs, Codex Topogr., Wiirtzburg, 1871, p. 107) as being near this spot.

The temple of Venus Felix and Roma Aeterna on the Velia (see fig. 23) was the largest in Rome; it was pseudo-dipteral with ten Corinthian columns of Greek marble at the ends, and probably twenty at the sides; it had an outer colonnade round the peribolus of about 180 columns of polished granite and porphyry. Of these only a few fragments now exist; for several centuries the whole area of this building was used as a quarry, while the residue of the marble was burnt into lime on the spot in kilns built of broken fragments of the porphyry columns. A considerable part of the two cellae with their apses, set back to back, still exists; in each apse was a colossal seated figure of the deity, and along the side walls of the cellae were rows of porphyry columns and statues in niches. The vault is deeply coffered with stucco enrichments once painted and gilt. The roof was covered with tiles of gilt bronze, which were taken by Pope Honorius I. (625-638) to cover the basilica of St Peter’s. These were stolen by the Saracens during their sack of the Leonine city in 846. The emperor Hadrian himself designed this magnificent temple, which was partially completed [9:20:828]in 135; the design was criticized rather severely by the architect Apollodorus (Dion Cass., Ixix. 4; Spart., Hadr., 19). ^[707.] The temple was probably finished by Antoninus Pius; it was partly burned in the reign of Maxentius, who began its restoration, which was carried OnbyConstantine (Amm. Afarcell., xvi. 10). The existing remains of the two cellae are mainly of Hadrian’s time, but contain patches of the later restorations. Between the south angle of this temple and the arch of Constantine stand the remains of a fountain, usually known as the Meta Sudans. This was a tall conical structure in a large circular basin, all lined with marble. From its brick facing it appears to be a work of the Flavian period.

That part of the Ccelian Hill which is near the Colosseum is covered with very extensive remains,—a great peribolus of brickfaced concrete, apparently of Flavian date, and part of a massive travertine arcade, somewhat similar to that of the Colosseum; most of the latter has been removed for the sake of the stone, but a portion still exists under the monastery and campanile of SS. Giovanni e Paolo. What this extensive building was remains doubtful till further excavations are made. According to one theory it is the temple of Claudius, built by Vespasian (Suet., Vesp., 9); but Bunsen’s suggestion is much more probable (BescE, iii. p. 476), that it was the house of Vectilius, bought and probably enlarged by Commodus (Hist. Aug.: Comm., 16), and connected with the Colosseum by a subterranean passage. Such a passage actually exists, and has been partly cleared out.

The so-called temple of Minerva Medica on the eastern slope of the Esquiline (so named from a statue found in it) is probably part of some baths. It is a curiously planned building, with central decagonal domed hall, probably of the time of Gallienus 263-268 (see Canina, Ind. Top., p. 161). Somewhat similar ruins beside the neighbouring basilica of S. Croce have been supposed to belong to a nyrnphaeum of Severus Alexander, mentioned in the Notitia, Regio v., but are more probably part of the Sessorium, a court of justice on the Esquiline. The remains on the Quirinal in the Colonna gardens of massive marble entablatures richly sculptured were formerly thought to belong to Aurelian’s great temple of the Sun, but it now appears certain that they belong to the very extensive thermae of Constantine, part of the site of which is now occupied by the Quirinal palace and neighbouring buildings. ^[708. (Terme dei Rοmtιni,]

The excavations of recent years have brought to light, and in many cases destroyed, a large number of domestic buildings; many of these are recorded in the Notizie degli Scavi and the Bull. Comm. ArcE Rom., 1872-1876. The extensive cutting away of the Tiber bank for the new embankment exposed sonic very ornate houses near the Villa Farnesina, richly decorated with marble, fine wall-paintings, and stucco reliefs, equal in beauty to any works of the kind that have ever been found. Some of these were cut oil the wall, and will be exhibited in a new museum about to be formed to contain all ancient works of art found in Rome; but the houses themselves have been destroyed. The laying out of the new Quirinal and Esquiline quarters also has exposed many fine buildings. One handsome villa, built over the Servian wall, may possibly be the house of Maecenas. A very remarkable vaulted room, decorated with paintings of plants and landscapes, has been shown to be a greenhouse; ^[709. Bull. Inst., Bull. Comm. Αrch.,] at one end is an apse with a series of step-like stages lor flowers. This one room has been preserved, though the rest of the villa has been destroyed; it is on the road leading from S. Maria Maggiore to the Lateran. The walls are a very fine specimen of tufa opus reticulatum, unmixed with brick, evidently earlier than the Christian era. Among the numerous buildings discovered in the Horti Sallustiani near the Quirinal is a veιy fine house of the 1st century a.d., in concrete faced with brick and opus reticulatum. It has a central circular domed hall, with many rooms and staircases round it, rising several stories high. This house was set in the valley against a cliff of the Quirinal, so that the third floor is level with the upper part of the hill. It is nearly on the line of the Servian wall, which stood here at a higher level on the edge of the cliff. This is identified as the house of Sallust, which at his death became crown property, and was used as a residence by Nero (Tac., Ann., xiii. 47) and other emperors till the 4th century. ^[710.] In 1884, near the Porta S. Lorenzo, a long line of houses was discovered during the making of a new road. Some of these were of opus reticulatum of the 1st century B.c.; others had the finest kind of brick-facing, probably of the time of Nero; all had been richly decorated with marble linings and mosaics. The line of the street was parallel to that of the later Aurelian wall, which at this part was built against the back of this row of houses. At the same time, behind the line of houses, were uncovered fine peperino and tufa piers of the aqueduct rebuilt by Augustus, one arch of which, forms the Porta S. Lorenzo. These interesting remains have all been completely destroyed. A fine house of the end of the 1st century a.d., with richly decorated walls, was exposed in June 1884 against the slope of the Quirinal, near the Palazzo Colonna; it was immediately destroyed to make room for new buildings.

The praetorian camp was first made permanent and surrounded with a strong wall by the emperor Tiberius (Suet., Tib., 37). Owing to the camp being included in the line of the Aurelian wall a great part of it still exists; it is a very interesting specimen of early imperial brick-facing. The wall is only 12 to 14 feet high, and has thinly scattered battlements, at intervals of 20 feet. The north gate (Porta Pmneipalis Dextra) is ιvell preserved; it had a tower on each side, now greatly reduced in height, in which are small windows with arched heads moulded in one slab of terracotta. The brick-facing is very neat and regular,—the bricks being about 1⅜ inches thick, with ⅜-inch joints. On the inside of the wall are rows of small rooms for the guards. Part of the Porta Decumana also remains. This camp was dismantled by Constantine, who removed its inner walls; the outer ones were left because they formed part of the Aurelian circuit. The present wall is nearly three times the height of the original camp wall. The upper part was added when Aurelian included it in his general circuit wall round Rome. The superior neatness and beauty of Tiberius’s brick-facing make it easy to distinguish where his work ends and that of the later emperors begins. Owing to the addition of the later wall it requires some care to trace the rows of battlements which belong to the camp.

The Pantheon is the most perfect among existing classical buildings in Rome (see fig. 24). It was built by Agiippa in 27 B.C., as is recorded on the frieze of the portico. What its original purpose was is not clear; on the one hand, it forms part of the great thermae built by Agiippa, and in position and design closely resembles the great circular calidarium in the thermae of Caracalla; on the other hand, it lias no Iiypocaust or hot-air flues, and was certainly consecrated as a temple , to Mars, Venus, and other supposed ancestors of Caesar’s family very soon after it was built (Dion Cass., Iiii. 27); it was used as the meeting-place of the Fratres Aiwales before they began to meet in the temple of Concord (see Henzen, Acta Frat. Arval., 1868, No. 71). ^[711.] It had the name Pantheum apparently from the first; Pliny (H.N., xxxvi. 4) men[9:20:829]tions the sculpture by the Athenian Diogenes which adorned it, and its capitals and dome covering of Syracusan bronze (xxxiv. 7); the ceiling of the portico too was of bronze, supported by massive tubular girders, ^[712.] which remained till Urban VIIL melted them to make cannon for S. Angelo and the baldacchino of St Peter’s; the bronze weighed 450,000 lb. The bronze tiles of the dome were stolen long before by Constans IL, in 663, but on their way to Constantiiiople they were seized by the Saracens. The portico has eight columns on the front and three on the sides, all granite monoliths except the re stored ones on the east side,—sixteen in all. The capitals are Corinthian, of white marble; the tym panum (deτ0s) of the pedi ment was filled with bronze reliefs of the battle of the gods and the giants. ^[713.] The walls of the circular part, nearly 20 feet thick, are of solid tufa concrete, thinly faced with brick. The enormous dome, 142 feet 6

inches in span, is cast in concrete made of pumice-

stone, pozzolana, and lime; being one solid mass, it covers the building like a shell, free from any lateral thrust at the haunches.

Round the central opening or liypaethrum still re mains a ring of enriched mouldings in gilt bronze, the only bit left of the bronze which once covered the whole dome. The lower story of the circular part and the walls of the pro- '

jecting portico were covered with slabs of Greek marble; a great part of the latter still remains, enriched with

Corinthian pilasters and bands of sculptured ornament. The two upper stories of the drum were covered outside with hard stucco of pounded marble. Inside the whole was lined with a great variety of rich Oriental marbles. This magnificent interior, divided into two orders by an entablature supported on columns and pilasters, has been much injured by alteration; but the materials are ancient, and the general effect is probably much the same as it was, not in the time of Agrippa, but after the restorations of Hadrian (Spart., Hadr., 181) and Severus, when the magnificently coloured porphyries and Oriental marbles were so largely used. ^[714.] About 608 the Pantheon was given by Phocas to Boniface IV., who consecrated it as the church of S. Maria ad Martyres. In 1881-82 the destruction of a row of houses behind the Pantheon exposed remains of a grand hall with richly sculptured entablature on Corinthian columns, part of the great thermae of Agrippa, which extend beyond the Via della Ciambella (fig. 24). A great part of the thermae appears from the brick stamps to belong to an extensive restoration in the reign of Hadrian, and bricks of his time are even said to have been found in the facing of the Pantheon itself. ^[715. Not. cl. Scαvi, Il Pantheon, Documents inédits sur les Thermes d'Agrippa, Il Pantheon, Das Pantheon, Das Panthéon,] (See Baths, vol. iii. p. 434 sq.)

Close by the Pantheon is the church of S. Maria sopra Mineiwa, which stands (as its name records) on the site of a temple to Minerva Chalcidica, probably founded by the great Pompey c. 60 b.c. ^[716. Rom.] Adjoining this were temples to Isis and Serapis, a cult which became very popular in Rome in the time of Hadrian; large quantities of sculpture, Egypto-Roman in style, have been found on this site at many different times. ^[717. , Dull. Comm. Arch. Rom., Ann. Inst., Miscell.,]

Several of the barracks (excubitoria) of the various cohorts of the vigiles or firemen have been discovered in various parts of Rome.

The central depot is buried under the Palazzo Savorelli; that of the second cohort is on the Esquiline, near the so-called temple of Mineiwa Medica; that of the third was found in 1873 near the baths of Diocletian (see Bull. Comm. Arch. Rom., 1873). The most perfect is that of the 7th cohort near S. Crisogono in Tras-tevere, a handsome house of the 2d century, decorated with mosaic floors, wall-paintings, &c. ^[718. Ann. Inst., Coorte VII. de' Vigili,]

The excavations made in exposing the ancient church of S. Clemente brought to light interesting remains of many different periods; drawings are given by Mullooly, Si Clement's Basilica, 1869, and De Rossi, Bull. Arch. Crixt., 1870, pt. iv.

Many remains exist of the Golden House ^[719. Casa Aurea,] of Nero, which show that this gorgeous palace covered an almost incredibly large space of ground, extending from the Palatine, over the Velia and the site of the temple of Venus and Rome, to the Esquiline, filling the great valley between the Coelian and the Esquiline where the Colosseum stands, and reaching far over the Esquiline to the great reservoir now called the “Sette Sale.” Noother extravagances or cruelties of Nero appear to have offended the Roman people so much as the erection of this enormous palace, which must have blocked up many important roads and occupied the site of a whole populous quarter. It was no doubt partly to make restitution for this enormous theft of land that Vespasian and Titus destroyed the Golden House and built the Colosseum and public thermae of Titus ^[720. Terme di Tito, 1822.] on part of its site. Under the substructions of the latter building extensive remains of the Golden House still exist; and at one point, at a lower level still, pavements and foundations remain of one of the numerous houses destroyed by Nero to clear the site. The great bronze colossus of Nero, 120 feet high (Suet., Nero, 31), which stood in one of the porticus of the Golden House, was moved by Vespasian, with head and attributes altered to those of Apollo (Helios), on to the Velia; and it was moved again by Hadrian, when the temple of Rome was built, on to the base which still exists near the Colosseum. Several coins show this colossus by the side of the Colosseum.

Under the Palazzo Doria, the church of S. Maria in Via Lata, and other neighbouring buildings extensive remains exist of a great porticus, with long rows of travertine piers; this building appears to be represented on fragments of the marble plan with the words SAEPT ... LIA. This is probably the Septa Julia, begun by Julius Caesar, and completed by Agrippa in 27 b,c., as the voting place for the Comitia Centuriata, divided into compartments, one for each century. The building contained rostra, and was also used for gladiatorial shows. Under the later empire it became a bazaar and resort of slave-dealers.

That curiously planned building on the Esquiline, in the new Piazza Vit. Emmanuele, where the so-called trophies of Marius once were placed (see drawing by Du Perac in his Vestigj), is one of the numerous castella or reservoirs from which the water of the various aqueducts was distributed in the quarters they were meant to supply. This was built by Severus Alexander at the termination of his Alexandrine aqueduct, opened in 225 (see Lamprid., Hist. Aug.: Sev. Alex., 25). The marble trophies are now set at the top of the Capitoline steps; their quaιτy mark shows them to be of the time of Domitian: it consists of the following inscription, now not visible, as it is cut on the under part—IMP. DOM. AVG . GERM. PER . CHREZ . LIB . ⅜C≤ . ^[721. Ann. Inst., Trophées de Marius, Médaillons de l'Empire,] Places of Amusement.

The Circus Maximus (see vol. v. p. 791) occupied the VaUis Murciae ^[722. L.L.,] between the Palatine and the Aventine. Its first rows of seats, which were of wood, were made under Tarquin I. (Liv., i. 56; Dionys., iii. 68). It was restored in 327 and 174 b.c. (Liv., viii. 20; xli. 27). In the reign of Julius Caesar it was rebuilt with (for the first time) lower seats of stone (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 24), the upper being still of wood (Suet., Caes., 39); Dionysius (iii. 68) describes it as it was after this rebuilding. It was further ornamented with marble by Augustus, Claudius, and other emperors. The. wooden part was burnt in the great fire of Nero, and again under Domitian, by whom it was restored wholly in stone and marble, and lastly it was restored and enlarged by Constantine. In its later state it had a marble façade with three external tiers of arches with engaged columns, and (inside) sloping tiers of marble seats, supported on concrete raking vaults (Plin., Raneg., 51). A great part of these vaults existed in the 16th century, and is shown by Du Perac. It held a quarter of a million spectators (Plin., H.N.,
[9:20:830]

xxxvi. 24). The end with the careeres was near the church of S. Maiia in Cosmedin. ^[723. For. Ur. Rorng Rom. Μed.,] Some of its substructures, with remains of very early tufa structures on the Palatine side, still exist below the church of S. Anastasia (see 58 in fig. 17). The obelisk now in the Piazza del Popolo was set on the spina by Augustus. The Circus Flaminius in the Campus Martius was built by the C. Flaminius Nepos killed at Thmsymene in 217 b.c.; remains of the structure were found in the 16th century under the Palazzo Mattel. In the Middle Ages its long open space was used as a rope-walk, hence the name of the church called S. Caterina dei Funari, which occupies part of its site. ^[724. Roma Αnt.] The circus of Caligula and Nero was at the foot of the Vatican Hill (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 15). The modern sacristy of St Peter’s stands over part of its site. The obelisk on its spina remained standing in situ till it was moved by Fontana ^[725. Trasportazione dell’ Obelisco Vat.,] for Sixtus V. to its present site in the centre of the piazza. Another circus was built by Hadrian near his mausoleum; remains of it were found in 1743, but nothing is now visible (Atti d. Pont. Acead., 1839). The great stadium, foundations of which exist under most of the houses of the Piazza Navona (Agonalis), and especially below S. Agnese, is probably that built by Domitian and restored by Severus Alexander. It was called from the latter emperor the Stadium Alexandrinum. That it was a stadium and not a circus is shown by the fact that its starting end is at right angles to the sides and not set diagonally, as was always the case with the careeres of a circus; nor is there any trace of foundations of a spina. The best preserved circus is that built by Maxentius in honour of his deified son Romulus, by the Via Appia, 2 miles outside the walls of Rome. Itwasattributed to Caracalla till 1825, when an inscription recording its true dedication was found. ^[726. Circo di Caracalla, Rom. Ant., De Lvd. Circens., Descr. dei drei, Ann. Inst., Gori (Thesavr. Vet. Dipt.,]

The first permanent naumachia was that constructed by Augustus between the foot of the Janiculan Hill and the Tiber; traces of it have recently been discovered near the church of S. Crisogono. The naumachia of Domitian was pulled down and the materials used to restore the Circus Maximus (Suet., Dom,, 5); its site is not known.

The first stone ^[727. De Spec.,] theatre in Rome was that built by Pompey, 56-52B.C.; it contained a temple to Venus Victrix, and" in front of it was a great ρorticus called Hecatostylum from its hundred columns. This is shown on the marble plan. ^[728. Ρomp.,] Considerable remains of the foundations exist between the Via de’ Chiavari, which follows the line of the scena, and the Via de’ Giubbonari and Via del Paradiso. Adjoining this was the curia of Pompey, where Caesar was murdered, after which it was burnt and the site decreed to be a “locus sceler-atus.” The colossal statue, popularly supposed to be that of Pompey at the feet of which Caesar died, ^[729. Rom. Ant.,] now in the Palazzo Spada, was found in 1553 near the theatre. This theatre was restored by Augustus (Mom Ancyr.) ; in the reign of Tiberius it was burnt and its rebuilding was completed by Caligula. The scena was again burnt in 80 a.d., and restored by Titus. According to Pliny (H. K. , xxxvi. 24), it held 40,000 spectators. In 1864 the colossal gilt bronze statue of Hercules, now in the Vatican, a work of the 3d century, was found near the site of the theatre of Pompey, carefully concealed underground. The theatre of Marcellus is much more perfect; complete foundations of the cunei exist under the Palazzo Savelli, and part of the external arcade is well preserved. This is built of travertine in two orders, Tuscan and Ionic, with delicate details, very superior to those of the Colosseum, the arcade of which is very similar to this in general design. This theatre was begun by J. Caesar, and finished by Augustus in 13 B.C., who dedicated it in the name of his nephew Marcellus. ^[730. Aug., Mon, Ancyr.— H.If.,] It was restored by Vespasian (Suet., Vesp., 19). Livy (xl. 51) mentions an earlier theatre on the same spot, built by M. Aemilius Lepidus in 179 B.c.

It stands partly in the Fomm Olitorium, a large extent of the travertine paving of which was exposed in 1875 (Bull Com. ArcE Mun., iii. 1875). Foundations also of the theatre of Balbus exist under the Palazzo Cenci; and in the Via di S. Maria in Caeaberis, No. 23, there is a small portion of the external arcade of the portions which belonged to this theatre; the lower story has travertine arches with engaged columns, and the upper has brick-faced pilasters. It was built by Cornelius Balbus in 13 b.c. (Suet., Aug., 29; Dion Cass., liv. 25). An interesting account of the temporary theatre of Scaurus, erected in 58 b.c., is given by Pliny (H.N., xxxvi. 2, 24). The same writer mentions an almost incredible building, which consisted of two wooden theatres made to revolve on pivots, so that the two together made an amphitheatre; this was erected by C. Curio in 50 b.c.

The first stone amphitheatre in Rome was that built by Statilius Taurus in the reign of Augustus. Its ruins are supposed to form the elevation called Monte Giordano, but none of it is visible. For the Colosseum see Amphitheatre, vol. i. The Amphitheatrum Castrense is in the line of the wall of Aurelian near tlιe Porta Asinaria; it is built of concrete, faced with neat brickwork, and was decorated with friezes and other ornaments in moulded terracotta. Its exterior had two tiers of arches between engaged Corinthian columns, all, even the foliage of the capitals, very neatly executed in terra-cotta. Only one piece with the upper order still exists on the outside of the Aurelian line. This amphitheatre is mentioned in the regionary catalogues under Regio v. It is supposed to have been erected for the amusement of the troops in the neighbouring camp, hence its name. From the character of the brick-facing the building appears to date from the early part of the 2d century.

Arches, Columns, Tombs, and Bridges.

The earliest triumphal arches were the two erected by L. Stertinius (196 b.c.) in the Forum Boarium and in the Circus Maximus, out of spoils gained in Spain. ^[731.] In the later years of the empire there were nearly forty in Rome. The arch of Titus and Vespasian on the Summa Sacra Via was erected by Domitian to commemorate the conquest of Judaea by Titus in his father’s reign. Reliefs inside the arch represent the triumphal procession—Titus in a chariot, and on the other side soldiers bearing the golden candlestick, trumpets, and table of prothesis, taken from the Jewish temple. The central part only of this monument is original; the sides were restored in 1823. ^[732.] ° Another arch in honour of Titus had previously been built (80 a.d.) in the Circus Maximus; its inscription is given in the Einsiedeln MS. (Gruter, Inscr., p. 244, No. 6). A plain travertine arch near the supposed palace of Commodus on the Ccelian is inscribed with the names of the consul Publius Corn. Dolabella (10 A.D.) and of the flamen martialis, C. Junius Silanus. In later times Nero’s aqueduct was built over it. It may possibly have been an entrance into the Campus Martialis, an enclosure on the Ctelian sacred to Mars, which was used for games when the Campus Martius was flooded. The so-called arch of Drusus by the Porta Appia also carries the specus of an aqueduct,—that built by Caracalla to supply his great thermae. Its coarse details show, however, that it is much later than the time of Drusus (Suet., Claud., 1). It was usual to ornament specially the arch of an aqueduct that happened to cross a road, ami this arch was probably built by Caracalla with the rest of his branch of the Aqua Marcia. Adjoining the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro a rich though coarsely decorated marble gateway with flat lintel still exists,—built, as its inscription records, in honour of Severus and his sons by the argentarii (bankers and silversmiths) and other merchants of the Forum Boarium in 204. It formed an entrance from the Forum Boarium into the Velabrum. The figure of Geta in the reliefs and his name have been erased by Caracalla; the sculpture is poor both in design and execution ^[733.] (see Bull. Insk, 1867, p. 217, and 1871, p. 233). Close by is a quadruple arch, set at the intersection of two roads, such as was called by the Romans an arch of Janus Quadrifons. Though partly built of earlier fragments, it is of the worst style of work; it cannot be earlier than the time of Constantine, and probably is of still later date. The finest existing arch is that by the Colosseum erected by Constantine. It owes, however, little of its beauty to that artistically degraded period. Not only most of its reliefs but its whole design and many of its architectural features were stolen from an earlier arch erected by Trajan as an entrance to his forum (see p. 826 above). The arch of Claudius, built in 43 to commemorate his supposed victories in Britain, stood across the Via Lata (modern Corso) between S. Francesco Saverio and the Palazzo Sciarra. Its exact Iiosition is shown in Bull.
[9:20:831]

Comm. Arch. Born., vi., pi. iv. Itsremainswereremoved in the middle of the 16th century, ^[734.] and nothing now is left but half its inscription, preserved in the garden of the Barberini palace, and two of its reliefs in the porch of the Villa Borghese. It is shown on both aurei and denarii of Claudius, with an attic inscribedDE BRITANNIS, and surmounted by a quadriga and trophies. The arch of Marcus Aurelius, also destroyed in the 16th century, spanned the modern Corso farther north, where the Via Lata had become the Via Flaminia. ^[735. {Bell. Goth.,] Alany of its fine reliefs are preserved in the Capitoline AIuseum. The central part of the once triple arch of Gallienus still exists on the Esquiline; it stands against the ancient Porta Esquilina of the Servian wall. It is built of travertine, is simple in design, with coarse details, and has a long inscription on its attic. The two side arches and pediment over the centre existed in the 16th century, and are shown in the AIantuan oil-painting of Rome, ^[736. Piante di Borna Anteriori al See. XPI.,] and in several antiquarian works of the 16th century. The inscription records that it was erected in 262 in honour of Gallienus and his wife Salonina by Al. Aurelius Victor, praefect of the city. ^[737. Veteres Arcus, Archi Trionp,]

The column of Antoninus Pius was a monolith of red granite, erected after his death by his adopted sons Al. Aurelius and L. Verus. One fragment of it is preserved in the Vatican with an interesting quarry inscription, recording that it was cut in the ninth year of Trajan’s reign, under the supervision of Dioscurus and the architect Aristides. The rest of its fragments were used by Pius VI. to repair the obelisk of AIonte Citorio, set up by Augustus in the Campus AIartius as the gnomon of a sun-dial (Plin., H.N., xxxvi. 15). The marble pedestal of the Antonine column is now in the Vatican; it has reliefs of the apotheosis of Faustina and Antoninus Pius, and processions of soldiers. This and the column of AI. Aurelius were both surmounted by colossal portrait statues of gilt bronze. The column of AL Aurelius is very similar in size and design to that of Trajan. Its spiral reliefs represent victories in Germany from 167 to 179, arranged in twenty tiers. Like the column of Trajan, it is exactly IOO Roman feet high, without the pedestal. The pedestal was originally much higher than at present, but is now partly buried; it is shown by Gamucci, Du Perac, and other 16th-century writers. This column stood in front of a temple to AL Aurelius, and within a great peribolus, forming a forum similar to that of Trajan, though much smaller; the remains of this temple probably form the elevation now called AIonte Citorio. ^[738.

The recent discovery of a cemetery of prehistoric (Etruscan) date is mentioned above, p. 812. Few tombs exist of the Roman period earlier than the 1st century B. C. ,—probably owing to the great extension of the city beyond the Servian limits, which thus obliterated the earlier burial places. The tomb of the Cornelian Scipios is the most important of early date which still exists. It is excavated in the tufa rock at the side of the Via Appia, outside the Porta Capena. Interments of the Scipio family went on here for about 400 years, additional chambers and passages being excavated from time to time. The peperino sarcophagus of Cornelius Lucius Scipio Barbatus (Liv., x. 12, 13), consul in 298 b.c., is now in the Vatican; its inscription, in rude Saturnian verse, is perhaps the most important existing specimen of early Latin epigraphy. _ Alany other inscribed slabs were found in the 17th century, covering the “loculi” in which lay the bodies of later members of the family. Tliose now existing in the tomb are modern copies, with blundered inscriptions. All are given by AIommsen (C , .∕.X., i. p. 11 sq. y }. . This burial-place of the Scipios is unlike those of other families, owing to the gens Cornelia keeping up the early custom of interment without burning; thus stone sarcophagi or loculi (rock-cut recesses) were required instead of mere pigeon-holes to hold the cinerary urns. The tomb of Bibulus, a few yards outside the Porta Ratumena, and remains of two recently discovered during the destruction of the Aurelian towers at the Porta Salara, date from about the middle of the 1st century b.c., as does also the curious tomb of the baker Eurysaces outside the Porta AIaggiore. In 1863 an interesting tomb of the Sempronia gens was discovered on the Quirinal, below the royal palace, near the site of the Porta Sanqualis. It is of travertine, with a rich entablature and frieze sculptured with the

Greek honeysuckle ornament (see Ball. Comm, Arch. Ram., iv.). This also is of the last years of the republic. ^[740. Colurnb. Libert, et Serv. Livi/r, Camera . . .

The mausoleum of Augustus, built 28 b.c., stands in the north part of the Campus AIartius, between the Tiber and the Via Flaminia. It is a massive cylindrical structure of concrete, faced with opus reticulatum; over that it was lined with marble slabs; inside were a series of radiating chambers, in plan like a wheel. On the top was a great mound of earth, planted with trees and flowers (Tac., Ann., iii. 9). As late as the 16th century its external form remained unaltered. ^[741. Vestigj,] Only the bare core exists now, with its fine opus reticulatum, best seen in the court of the Palazzo Valdam-brini. The inside is concealed by modern seats, being used now as a circus (Teatro Correa). The sepulchral inscription in honour of Augustus, engraved on two bronze columns at the entrance, is preserved to us by its copy at Ancyra. It records an almost incredible amount of building: in addition to the long list of buildings mentioned by name Augustus says,DVO. ET. OCTAGINTA. TEMPLA. DEVM. IN. VRBE. CONSVL. SEXTVM . . . REFECI. ^[742. Bull. Comm. Arch. born.,] The first buiial in the mausoleum of Augustus was that of AIarcellus, 22 B.O., and it continued to be the imperial tomb till the death of Nerva, 98 A.D., after whose interment there w⅛s no more room. It was sacked by Alaric in 409, and in the 12th century was made into a fortress by the Colonna family, and suffered much from constant party struggles.

The mausoleum of Hadrian, begun in 135 as a substitute for that built by Augustus, was a large circular building on a square podium; its walls, of enormous thickness, are of concrete faced with blocks of peperino, the whole being lined with Parian marble and surrounded by a colonnade with rows of statues,—a work of the greatest magnificence. The bronze pine-cone, now in the Vatican, was (according to Vacca) found near the mausoleum, and probably surmounted its conical dome. The splendour of the whole is described by Procopius (J5. G., i. 22), who mentions its siege by the Goths, when the defenders hurled the statues on to the heads of the enemy. In the 6th century it was made into a papal castle called S. Angelus inter Nubes, and all through the Aliddle Ages it suffered much from constant attacks. The interior chambers are still well preserved, but its outside has been so often wrecked and refaced that little of the original masonry is visible.

Several of the grander sepulchral monuments of Rome were built in the form of pyramids. One of these still exists, included in the Aurelian wall, by the Porta Ostiensis. It is a pyramid of concrete, 118 feet high, faced with blocks of white marble, and contains a small chamber decorated with painted stucco. An inscription in large letters on the marble facing records that it was built as a tomb for C. Cestiusa praetor, tribune of the people, and Septemvir of the epulones (officials who supervised banquets in honour of the gods)—an office founded in 196 b.c. (Liv., xxxiii. 42). It was erected, according to Cestius’s will, by his executors, in the space of 330 days. It dates from the time of Augustus ^[743. Ann, Inst.,] (see Falconieri, in Nardini, Roma Aniica, iv. p. 1, ed. 1818-20). Another similar pyramid, popularly known as the tomb of Romulus, stood between the mausoleum of Hadrian and the basilica of St Peter. It was destroyed in the 15th century during the rebuilding of the long bridge which connects the former building with the Vatican.

The earliest bridge was a wooden drawbridge called the Pons Sublicius from the piles (sublieae) on which it was built. The river being an important part of the defence of Rome from the Aventine to the Porta Fluminalis (see plan of Servian wall, fig. 8), no permanent bridges were made till the Romans were strong enough not to fear attacks from without. The Pons Sublicius appears to [9:20:832]have been of wood even in the imperial period. ^[744. Fast., Hist.,] Its exact site is doubtful, but some existing foundations near the foot of the Aven-tine, near the Mariuoratum, may have been the supports of its wooden piers. The first stone bridge was completed in 142 b.c., when the conquest of Etruria and the defeat ot Hannibal had put an end to fears of invasion; it was called the Pons Aemilius, after the pontifex nιaximus ^[745.] DI. Aemilius Lepidus, its founder. It was also called Pons Lapideus to distinguish it from the wooden Sublician bridge. The modern Ponte Rotto is on the site of this; but the existing three arches are mediaeval. An ancient basalt-paved road still exists, leading to the bridge from the Forum Boarium. The Pons Fabricius unites the city and the island (Insula Tiber-ina); Livy (ii. 5) gives the fable of the formation of this island from the Tarquin com, cut from the Campus Martius and thrown into the river. The bridge derived its name from L. Fabricius, a curator viarum in 62 B.c.; its inscription, twice repeated, isL. Fabricivs . c. f . cvr . viar . facivndvm . coeravit. Like the other existing bridges, it is built of great blocks of peperino and tufa, with a massive facing of travertine on both sides. Corbels to support centering were built in near the springing of the arches, so that they could be repaired or even rebuilt without a scaffolding erected in the river-bed. The well-preserved Pons Cestius, probably named after L. Cestius, praefectus urbi in 46 B.c., unites the island and the Janiculan side; on the marble parapet is a long inscription recording its restoration in 370 by Gratian, Valentinian, and Valens. The next bridge, Ponte Sisto, is probably on the site of an ancient bridge called in the Kotitia Pons Aurelius. Marliano gives an inscription (now lost) which recorded its restoration in the time of Hadrian. The Pons Aelius was built in 135 by Hadrian to connect his mausoleum with the Campus Martius; it is still well preserved, and is now called the Ponte S. Angelo (see Dante, Infer., xviii. 28-33). Its inscription, now lost, is given in the Einsiedeln MS.—IMP. CAESAR . DIVI. TRAIANI. PARTHICI. FILIVS . DIVI. NERVAE . NEPOS . TRAIANVS . HADRIANVS . AVG. PONT. MAX . TRIB. POT. XVIIII. COS. III. P. P. FECIT. The Pons Aelius is shown on coins of Hadrian. A little below it are the foundations of another bridge, probably the Pons Neronianus of the Mimbilia, called also Vaticanus, built probably by Nero as a way to his Vatican circus and the Horti Agrippinae. ^[746. Atti d. Ponk Accad., De Mûris et Portis,] Rxgiones of Augustus.

In spite of the extensive growth of the city under the republic no addition was made to the four regiones of Servius till the reign of Augustus, who divided the city and its suburbs into fourteen regiones, the first six of which embraced the original four of Servius. The lists in the Kotitia and Curiosum are the chief aids in determining the limits of each, which in many cases cannot be done with any exactness (see Preller, Die Regimen der Stadt Rom, 1846, and Uhlrichs, Codex Topograph., Würzburg, 1871). Each regio was divided into vici or parishes, each of which formed a religious body, with its aedicula Iarium, and had magistri vicorum, the lowest in rank of the Roman magistracy. The smallest regio (No.

II.) contained seven vici, the largest (No. XIV.) seventy-eight. The list is as follows :—

I. or Porta Capena, extended to the Aurelian Porta Appia.

II. or Coelimmüana, the Coelian Hill.

III. or Isix et Serapis, included the valley of the Colosseum and the adjoining part of the Esquiline.

IV. or Templum Paxis et Sacm Via, included the Velia, most of the Subura, the fora of Nerva and Vespasian, the Sacra Via, and also buildings along the north-east side of the Forum Magnum.

V. or Esquilina, north part of the Esquiline and the Viminal.

VI. or Alta Semita, the Quirinal as far as the praetorian camp.

VIL or Via LcUa, the valley bounded on the west by the Via

Lata, and by the neighbouring hills on the east.

VIIL or Foriim Rornanurn, also included the fora of Julius, Augustus, and Trajan, and the whole Capitoline Hill.

IX. or Circus Flaminius, between the Tiber, the Capitol, and the Via Lata.

X. or Palatium, the Palatine Hill.

XI. or Circus Maximus, the valley between the Palatine and the Aventine, with the Velabrum and Forum Boarium.

XIL or Piscina Ριιblixa, between the Coelian and the Avcntine, and beyond the Via Appia, including the site of Caracalla’s therraae.

XIII. or Aventinus, the hill, and the bank of the Tiber below it.

XIV. or Tranxtiberina, the whole district across the river and the Tiber Island. ^[747. For. Urb. Pom., Pom. Ant.,] , Ihe. walls of Aurelian (see Plates VI. and VIII.), more than 12 miles in circuit, were mainly built to enclose the regiones of Augus-tus, the greater part of which were then thickly inhabited. This enormous work was begun in 271, to defend Rome against sudden attacks of the Germans and other northern races when the great armies of Rome were fighting in distant countries. ^[748. Aurek,] After" the death of Aurelian the walls were completed by Probus in 280, and about a century later they were restored and strengthened by the addition of gate-towers under Arcadius and Honorius (395-425), in place of the earlier gateways of Aurelian; this is recorded by existing inscriptions on several of the gates. ^[749.] At many periods these walls suffered much from the attacks of the Goths (Procop., Bell. Goih., iii. 22, 24), and were restored successively by Theodoric (about 500), by Belisarius (about 560), and by various popes during the 8th and 9th centuries, and in fact all through the Middle Ages. A great part of the Aurelian wall still exists in a more or less perfect state; but it has wholly vanished where it skirted the river, and a great part of its trans-Tiberine course is gone. The most perfect piece is that in the gardens of the Villa Ludovisi. Other well-preserved pieces are by the Porta Appia, and between the Lateran and the Amphitheatrum Castrense. The wall, of concrete, has the usual brick-facing and is about 12 feet thick, with a guards’ passage formed in its thickness. Fig. 25 shows its plan: on the inside the passage has tall open arches, which look like those of an aqueduct, and at regular intervals of about 45 feet massive square towers are built, projecting on the outside of the wall, in three stories, the top story rising above the top of the wall. The height of the wall varies according to the contour of the ground; in parts it was about 60 feet high outside and 40 inside. Necessaria, supported on two travertine corbels, projected from the top of the wall on the outside beside most of the towers. The Einsiedeln MS. gives a description of the complete circuit, counting all the gates, fourteen in number, as follows :—

Porta S. Petri (destroyed); P. Flaminia (in use); P. Pinciana (closed); P. Salaria (destroyed in 1870); P. Nomentana (closed); P. Tiburtina (in use, now called P. S. Lorenzo); P. Praenestina (in use, now Porta Maggiore); P. Asinaria (closed); P. DIetrovia (closed); P. Latina (closed); P. Appia (in use, now called P. S. Sebastiano); P. Ostiensis (in use, now P. S. Paolo). On the Jani-culan side, P. Portensis (destroyed); P. Aurelia (in use). One gate, known as the P. Chiusa, is omitted in this list, owing to its being blocked up in the time of the Einsiedeln writer. Its ancient name is not known.

These existing gates are mostly of the time of Honorius; each is flanked by a projecting tower, and some are double, with a second pair of towers inside. Several have grooves for a portcullis Gata-rctxta) in the outer arch. The handsomest gate is the P. Appia, with two massive outer towers, three stages high, the upper semicircular in plan. DIany of the gates of Honorius have Christian symbols or inscriptions. The general design of all these gates is much the same,—a central archway, with a row of windows over it and two flanking towers, some square, others semicircular in plan. In many of the gates older materials are used, blocks of tufa, travertine, or marble. The doors themselves swung on pivots, the bottom ones let into a hole in the threshold, the upper into projecting corbels.

At many points along the line of the Aurelian wall older buildings form part of the circuit,—near the Porta Asinaria a large piece of the Domus Laterana, a house of the 3d century which gave its name to the Lateran basilica, and a little farther on, by S. Croce in Gerusalemme, the Amphitheatrum Castrense; the latter, of about the end of the 1st century a.d., has two tiers of arches and engaged columns of moulded brick on the outside. Between the P. Praenestina and the P. Tiburtina comes a large castellum of the Aqua Tepula. The Praetorian Camp forms a great projection near the P. Nomentana.

foot of the Pincian Hill, is formed by remains of a lofty and enormously massive building, faced with line opus reticulatum of the 1st century B. c. Owing to Hiesinkingof the foundation this is very much out of the perpendicular, and was known as the “murus tortus” at a very early time. ^[750. Bell. Goth.,] What this once important building was is uncertain. It has been supposed to belong to the tomb of the Domitii (Suet., Dom., 2), but on scanty grounds. Two archways which form gates in the Aurelian wall are of much earlier date. The Porta Maggiore consists of a grand triple arch of the Claudian aqueduct built in travertine. The P. S. Lorenzo is a single travertine arch, built by Augustus where the aqueduct carrying the Aqua Marcia, Tepula, and Julia crossed the Via Tiburtina. The inner gateway, built of massive travertine blocks by Honorius, was pulled down by Pius IX. in 1S68 for the sake of the material. ^[751. De Rom. Muris et Portis, Le Mura di Roma, Mura di Roma, Rome and the Campagna,] Literature.— Probably no arcliaeological subject has so copious a literature as that dealing with the topography of Rome; much of this, however, has been rendered obsolete by subsequent discoveries. The reader who wishes to study the subject in a fairly concise form will find the following books the most use-ful. ^[752.] Nardini, Roma Antica, ed.

The very large and magnificently illustrated works by Canina must be used with great caution; they contain imaginative restorations rather than accurate representations of what really exists; even those drawings which profess to give the existing remains are rendered of little value by their numerous inaccuracies. The chief of Canina’s works are Indicazione di Roma Antica, 1830; Esposizioue topografica, 1842; Edifizj di Roma Antica, 1848-56; Foro Romano, 1845; and Architettura Antica, 1834-44.

The student who wishes to enter into the subject in detail and form independent opinions will have an enormous mass of literature to wade through.

(3) Tliirdly we have a large number of works, mostly illustrated, produced from the 15th to the 18th century, the value of which is frequently very great from the fact that they describe a large number of ancient monuments which no longer exist. Some of these, especially those earliest in date, exist only in MS. in the libraries of the Vatican, the Uffizi, Milan, and elsewhere; a very valuable MS. of Ligorio (16th century) is preserved in the Bodleian at Oxford. Among these MSS. are drawings of ancient buildings by Raphael, Bramante, Bramantino, Baldassare, Sallustio Peruzzi, Andrea Sansovino, Palladio, and in fact by nearly all the great architects of the 16th century.

Christian Rome.

1. From the Jjth to the Kith Century.

The era of church building in Rome may be said to begin with the reign of Constantine and the peace of the church. Before then Christian worship was conducted with various degrees of secrecy either in private houses or in the Catacombs Gj.v. ∖ ac cording as the reigning emperor viewed the sect with tolerance or dislike.

The type of church which in the beginning of the

4th century was adopted with certain modifica tions from the pagan basilica, though varying much in size, had little or no variety in its general form and ar rangement. One fixed model was strictly ad hered to for many cen turies, and, in spite of numberless alterations and additions, can be traced in nearly all the ancient churches of

Rome.

Fig. 26 shows a typical example, omitting all later changes. ^[753.] The plan is that of the lower church of S. Clemente, built in the 4th century, probably in the reign of Constantine; an existing inscription records its restoration by S.

Siricius (384-398). The fittings, altar, choir-screen, &c., are not now in situ, but were moved into the upper church when that was built, between IlOO and 1118.

They were then rather carelessly put together, ι and the proper positions of the gospel and the epistle ambo reversed.

The figure shows these fittings replaced in the ancient church as they originally stood; they are rather later than the building itself, being made under Pope John, probably the second of that name (532-535); his monogram is sculptured on the marble slabs which form the low walls of the choir. In the 13th century ornaments of mosaic inlay were added on these 6th-century screens by one of the Cos-mati. The baldacchino which now exists in the upper church is of c. 1100, but two of the columns of a much older canopy are preserved by being used in the construction of a fine 15th-century tomb near the high altar. These have richly carved caps of semi-classical style, and, as well as the high altar, have an inscription recording their gift to the church by the priest Mercurius in the pontificate of Hormisdas (514-523). The paintings of the 9th century, and even earlier, which cover the walls of the lower church are among the most important existing specimens of early Christian ait. ^[754. Clement and his Basilica, Bull. Arch. Crist.,]
[9:20:834]

The typical church was a simple rectangular building, with or without aisles, having a large apse at the west end, and at the east three doors opening from a cloister-like atrium; ^[755.] when space was limited three sides of the atrium were omitted, leaving only a long pillared narthex or porch which extended along the whole width of the nave. The apse or presbyteriuιn, which was raised above the nave, contained a central marble throne for the celebrant and a long bench for the rest of the clergy. The high altar stood a little forward from the apse; and over it was a square canopy or baldacchino supported on four marble columns; each of the four arches of the canopy had a curtain, which was drawn close during the consecration of the elements; at other times these curtains were twisted round the four columns of the baldacchino. The celebrant stood with his back to the apse, looking eastwards towards the people over the altar. ^[756.] The high altar stood over the tomb of some saint or confessor, hence called the “confessio”; this was so arranged as to be at least partly visible, and usually was reached by a few steps descending from the nave. In later times the confessio became frequently a spacious crypt containing a small altar of its own. At this point cancelli or marble screens ran across the whole width of the church, both nave and aisles; and hence the part thus railed off was called the “chancel.” The choir occupied most of the western half of the nave, and was raised one step above it; it was completely surrounded by a low marble wall or screen, along two sides of which a marble bench was fixed. On the right ^[757.] was the gospel ambo, its marble book-rest usually distinguished by a sculptured eagle, and beside it the tall paschal candlestick. On the left was the epistle ambo. ^[758.] The font was frequently an ancient marble or porphyry bath, as in the Lateran baptistery and that of S. Maria Maggiore; but in early times an ordinary parish church had no font; baptisms were only performed in one or two of the great basilicas, and then in a separate building, usually octagonal in shape. In the centre of the open atrium stood a fountain for ablutions performed before entering the church, as in an Oriental mosque.

The walls of these early churches were mostly built of concrete, faced with brick, left structurally quite plain, and decorated only with painted stucco or glass mosaics,—especially (internally) in the apse and on the face of its arch, and (externally) on the east or entrance wall, the top of which was often built in an overhanging curve to keep off the rain. The windows were plain, with semicircular arches, and were filled with pierced marble screens, or in some cases with slabs of translucent alabaster·; the latter was the case at S. Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, and examples of the former still exist in the very early church formed in the rooms of some tliermae on the Esquiline (possibly those of Trajan), below the 6th-century church of S. Martino ai Monti. Almost the only bit of external architectural ornament was the eaves cornice, frequently (as at the last-named church) formed of marble cornices stolen from earlier classical buildings. Internally the nave columns, with their capitals and bases, were usually taken from some classical building, and some churches are perfect museums of fine sculptured caps and rich marble shafts of every material and design. ^[759.] At first the nave had no arches, the columns supporting a horizontal entablature, as at S. Clemente, S. Maria Maggiore, and S. Maria in Trastevere, but afterwards, in order to widen the intercolumniation, simple round arches of narrow span were introduced, thus requiring fewer columns. The roof was of the simple tie-beam and kingpost construction, left open, but decorated with painting or metal plates. The floor was paved either with coarse mosaic of large tesserae (as at S. Pudentiana) or with slabs of marble stripped from ancient buildings. A later development of this plan added a small apse containing an altar at the end of each aisle, as in S. Maria in Cos-medin and S. Pietro in Vincoli. ^[760. Architecture, AltchristIicKen Kirchen,]

The type of church above described was used as a model for by far the majority of early churches not only in Rome but also in England, France, Germany, and other Western countries. Another form was, however, occasionally used in Rome, which appears to have been derived from the round temple of pagan times. This is a circular building usually domed and surrounded with one or more rings of pillared aisles. To this class belong the combined church and mausoleum of Costanza (see fig. 27) and that of SS. Marcellinus and Petrus, both built by Constantine, the former to hold the tomb of his daughters Constantia and Helena, the latter that of his mother Helena. The latter is on the Via Labicana, about 2 miles outside

Rome; it is a circular domed building, now known as the Torn Pignattara, from the Jdgnatte or amphorae built into the concrett dome to lighten it. The mausoleum of S. Cos tanza, close by S. Agnese fuori, is also domed, with circular aisle, or rather ambulatory, the vault of the latter decorated with mosaic or classical style

(see Mosaic, vol. xvi. p.

852). The red porphyry sarcophagi, sculptured richly with reliefs, from these mausolea are now in the Vatican. On a much larger scale is the church of S. Stefano Ro-

tondo on the Ccelian, built by Pope Simplicius (468-

483), with a double ring of pillared aisles, the outer one of which was pulled down and a new enclosure wall built by

Nicholas V. Other round churches are S. Teodoro

(by the Vicus Tuscus), of the 8th century, and S.

Bernardo, which is one of the domed halls of Diocletian’s tliermae, consecrated as a church in 1598.

Space will not allow any individual description of the very numerous and important churches in Rome which are built on the above-described plan. The principal examples are these: ^[761.] -S. Puden-tiana, traditionally the oldest in Rome, rebuilt by Adrian I. (772-795); S. Sabina, 5th century; S. Vitale, 5th century, founded by Innocent I. (402-417); S. Martino ai Monti, 500; S. Balbina, 6th century; church of Ara Coeli, founded in 6th century as S. Maria in Capitolio; S. Giorgio in Velabro, rebuilt by Leo II. (682-683); S. Cesareo, 8th century; S. Maria in Via Lata, built by Sergius I. (687-701); S. Crisogouo, rebuilt in 731 by Gregory III.; S. Maria in Cosmedin and S. Giovanni ad Portam Latinam, both rebuilt c. 772 by Adrian I.; S. Maria in Domnica, rebuilt by Paschal I. (817-824), who also rebuilt S. Cecilia in Trastevere c. 821 and S. Prassede in 822; S. Março, rebuilt by Gregory IV. in 833; S. Maria Nuova, founded by Nicholas I. (858-867), now called S. Francesca Romana; S. Anastasia, founded in the 4th, rebuilt in the IOth century; S. Bartolomeo in Isola and the church of the Quattro Santi Incoronati, built by Paschal II. about 1113; and S. Maria in Trastevere, rebuilt by Innocent II. in 1139. ^[762.]

Though the apses and classical columns of the naves in these churches were built at the dates indicated, yet in many cases it is difficult to trace the existence of the ancient walls; the alterations and additions of many centuries have frequently almost wholly concealed the original structure. With the exception of S. Clemente, the early choir, placed as shown in fig. 26, has invariably been destroyed; the side walls have often been broken through by the addition of rows of chapels; and the whole church, both within and without, has been overlaid with the most incongruous architectural features in stucco or stone. The open roof is usually concealed either by a wooden panelled ceiling or by a stucco vault. The throne ^[763.] and marble benches in the apse have usually given place to more modern wooden fittings, to suit the later position of the choir, which has always been transferred from the nave to the apse. In many cases the mosaics of the apse and the columns of the nave are the only visible remains of the once simple and stately original church. ^[764. Archaeologia,]

2. Fram 1200 to i45θ; and the Papal Palaces.

The IOth and Ilth centuries in Rome were extraordinarily barren in the production of all branches of the fine arts, even that of architecture; and it was not till the end of the 12th that any important revival began. The 13th century was, however, one of great artistic activity, when an immense number of beautiful works, especially in marble enriched with mosaic, were produced in Rome. This revival, though on different lines, was very similar to the rather later one which took place at Pisa (see Pisano), and, like that, was mainly due to the great artistic talents of one family,—the [9:20:835]Cosmati, ^[765. Architettura del Medio Evo,] seven members of which, for four generations, were skilful architects, sculptors, and mosaicists.

The following are the names and dates known from existing inscriptions :—

Their principal works in Rome are :—ambones of S. Maria in Ara Cceli (Lorenzo); door of S. Saba, 1205, anti door with mosaics of S. Tommaso in Formis (Jacopo); chapel of the Sancta Sanctorum, by the Lateran (Cosimo); pavement of S. Jacopoalla Lungara, and (probably) the magnificent episcopal throne and choir-screen in S. Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, of 1254 (Jacopo the younger); ^[766.] baldacchino of the Lateran and of S. Maria in Cosmedin, c. 1294 (Adeodato); tombs in S. Maria sopra Minerva (c. 1296), in S. Maria Maggiore, and in S. Balbina (Giovanni), A large number of other works by members and pupils of the same family, but unsigned, exist in Rome. These are mainly altars and baldacchini, choir-screens, paschal candlesticks, ambones, tombs, and the like, all enriched with sculpture and glass mosaic of great brilliance and decorative effect.

Besides the more mechanical sort of work, such as mosaic patterns and architectural decoration, they also produced mosaic pictures and sculpture of very high merit, especially the recumbent effigies, with angels standing at the head and foot, in the tombs of Ara Cceli, S. Maria Maggiore, anti elsewhere. One of their finest works is in S. Cesareo; this is a marble altar richly decorateel with mosaic in sculptured panels, and (below) two angels drawing back a curtain (all in marble) so as to expose the open grating of the confessio. The magnificent cloisters of S. Paolo fuori Ie Mura, built about 1285 by Giovanni, the youngest of the Cosmati, are one of the most beautiful works of this school. The baldacchino of the same basilica is a signed work of the Florentine Arnolfo del Cambio, 1285, “cum suo socio Petro,” probably a pupil of the Cosmati. Other works of Arnolfo, such as the Braye tomb at Ohvieto (g , .v.), show an intimate artistic alliance between him and the Cosmati. The equally magnificent cloisters of the Lateran, of about the same date, are very similar in design; both these triumphs of the sculptor-architect’s and mosaicist’s work have slender marble columns, twisted or straight, richly inlaid with bands of glass mosaic in delicate and brilliant patterns. The shrine of the Confessor at AVestminster is a work of this school, executed about 1268 (see Mosaic). The general style of works of the Cosmati school is

Gothic in its main lines, especially in the elaborate altar-canopies, with their pierced geometrical tracery. In detail, however, they differ widely from the purer Gothic of northern countries. The richness of effect which the English or French architect obtained by elaborate and carefully worked mouldings was produced in Italy by the beauty of polished marbles and jewel-like mosaics,—the details being mostly rather coarse and often carelessly executed.

Chiefly to the 13th century belong the large number of beautiful campanili, which are the most conspicuous relics of the mediaeval period in Rome. The finest of these are attached to the churches of S. AIaria Nuova, SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and S. Maria Maggiore. Others belong to the basilicas of S. Lorenzo fuori and S. Croce in Gerusalemme, and to S. Giorgio in Velabro, S. Maria in Cosmedin, S. Alessio, S. Giovanni ad Portam Latinam, S. Cecilia, S. Crisogono, and S. Pudentiana. They occupy various positions with regard to the church, being all later additions; that of SS. Giovanni e Paolo stands at some distance from it. In design they are very similar, consisting of many stages, divided by brick and marble cornices; in the upper stories are from two to four windows on each side, with round arches supported on slender marble columns. They are decorated with brilliantly coloured eiotole or disks of earthenware, enamelled and painted in green or turquoise blue, among the earliest existing specimens of the so-called majolica (see Pottery, vol. xix. p. 624 sq.). Sometimes disks or crosses made of red or green porphyry are inlaid in the walls. In most cases on one face of the top story is a projecting canopied niche, which once contained a statue or mosaic picture. The walls are built of fine neat brickwork. One campanile (that of S. Maria Maggiore), the largest and once the handsomest of all, has string-courses of enamelled and coloured terra-cotta. The slender columns of the windows have often proved insufficient to support the weight, and so many of the arches are built up. ^[767. Les Cloches de Rome,]

Though but little used for churches, the Gothic style, in its modified Italian form, was almost Universallv employed for domestic architecture in Rome during the 13th and 14th centuries. Tufa ^[768. e.g.,] or brick was used for the main walls, the lowest story being often supported on an arcade of pointed arches and marble columns. The windows were usually formed of large marble slabs with trefoilshaped heads or cusped arches. As a rule the upper stories projected slightly over the lower wall, and were supported on small ornamental machicolations. The top story frequently had an open loggia, with rows of pointed arches. AVhen vaulting was used it also was of the pointed form, usually in simple quadripartite bays, with slightly moulded groin-ribs. The finest existing specimen ol this style is the palace built about 1300 by Boniface VIIL (Gaetanc family), enclosing the tomb of Cecilia AIetella on the Via Appia, with a graceful little chapel within the precincts of the castle. This building is very worthy of study; the remaining part is well preserved. Many houses of this period, though generally much injured by alterations, still exist in Rome. They are mostly in out-of-the-way alleys, and, not being mentioned in any books, are seldom examined. The Ghetto and the quarter near the Ponte Rotto contain many of these interesting buildings, as well as some of the most crowded parts of the Trastevere district; all are rapidly disappearing under the wholesale destruction of old streets now in progress. Among those which may possibly escape for a while is the 13th-century house -where Giulio Romano lived, near the Palazzo di Venezia, and the Albergo del Orso, at the end of the Via di Tordi-nona, of the same period, which was an inn in the 16th century and is one still; this has remains of a fine upper loggia, with rich cornices in moulded terra-cotta; the lowest story has pointed vaulting resting on many pillars. Another graceful but less stately house exists, though sadly mutilated, opposite the entrance to the atrium of S. Cecilia in Trastevere. ^[769.] Very few now remain of the once numerous lofty towers built by the turbulent Roman barons for purposes of defence. The finest, the Torre della AIilizia on the Viminal, was built in the 13th century by the sons of Petrus Alexius; of about the same date is the Torre dei Conti, near the forum oi Augustus, built by AIarchione of Arezzo; both these were once much higher than they are now; they are very simple and noble in design, with massive walls faced with neat brickwork, much resembling that of the 2d century.

Till the 14th century the Lateran was the usual residence of the pope; this was once a very extensive building, covering four times its present area. The original house is ι said to have belonged to the senator Plautius Lateranus in the reign of Nero; but the existing part on the line of the Aurelian wall is of the 3d century. This house, which had become the property of the emperors, was given by Constantine as a residence for S. Sylvester; it was very much enlarged at many periods during the next ten centuries; in 1308 a great part was burnt, and in 1586 the ancient palace was completely destroyed by Sixtus V., and the present palace built by Domenico Fontana. The Cappella Sancta Sanctorum (see list of Cosmati works) is the only relic of the older palace. ^[770.] The present palace has never been used as a papal residence; in the 18th century it was an orphan asylum, and is now a museum of classical sculpture and early Christian remains.

The Vatican palace also appears to have originated in a house which existed in the time of Constantine. This was rebuilt by Innocent III. (c. 1200) and enlarged by Nicholas III. (1277-80). It did not, however, become the fixed residence of the popes till after the return from Avignon in 1377. In 1415 John XXIIL connected the Vatican and the castle of S. Angelo by a covered passage carried on arches. But little of the existing palace is older than the 15th century; Nicholas V. in 1447 began its reconstruction on a magnificent scale, and this was earned on by Sixtus IV. (Sistine chapel), Alexander VI. (Appartamenti Borgia), Julius II. and Leo X. (Bramante’s cortile and paintings by Raphael), and Paul III. (Sala Regia and Cappella Paolina by Antonio da Sangallo). Sixtus V. and his successors built the lofty part of the palace on the east of Bramante’s cortile. The Scala Regia was built by Bernini for Urban VIII., the Aluseo Pio-Clementino under ClementXIV. and Pius VI., the Braccio Nuovo under Pius A r IL, and lastly the grand stairs up to the cortile were added by Pius IX.

The Quirinal palace, now occupied by the king of Italy, is devoid of architectural merit. It stands on the highest part of the hill, on the site of part of thé baths of Constantine. This palace was begun in 1574, under Gregory XIII., by Flaminio Ponzio, and was completed by Fontana and AIaderna under subsequent popes.

Ponte Rotto, is perhaps the sole relic of the domestic architecture of an earlier period,—the Ilth century. Its architectural decorations are an extraordinary mixture of marble fragments of the most miscellaneous sort, all taken from classical buildings; it has a long but somewhat unintelligible inscription over the doorway. - , » i , , . . .
[9:20:836]

The only important church in Rome which is wholly Gotliic in style is S. Maria sopra Minerva, the chief church of the Dominican order. This was not the work of a Roman architect, but was designed by two Dominican friars from Florence—Fra Ristoro and Fra Sisto-about 1289, who were also the architects of their own church of S. Maria Novella. It much resembles the contemporary churches of the same order in Florence, having wide-spanned pointed arches on clustered piers and simple quadripartite vaulting. Its details resemble the early French in character. ^[771.] It contains a large number of fine tombs; among them that of Durandus, bishop of Mende (the author of the celebrated Rationale diviηorum offiei∙ οrurn), by Giovanni Cosmas, c. 1300, and the tomb of Fra Angelico, the great Dominican painter, who died in Rome, 1455. The most elaborate specimen of ecclesiastical Gothic in Rome is that part of S. Maria in Ara Cceli which was rebuilt about 1300, probably by one of the Cosmati, namely, the south aisle and transept. For at least two centuries after the death of Giovanni Cosmas no native Roman appears to have excelled in any branch of the fine arts. The sculptured effigy and reredos of Cardinal Alençon in S. Maria in Trastevere, executed about 1400 by a certain Paulus Romanns, is a fair example of the decadence which took place during this period; the effigy is a very clumsy and feeble copy of the fine recumbent figures of the Cosmati.

3. Florentine Period, c. 1450-1550.

The long period of almost complete artistic inactivity in Rome was broken iu the 15th century by the introduction of a number of foreign artists, chiefly Florentines, who during this and the succeeding century enriched Rome with an immense number of magnificent works of art. The dawn of this brilliant epoch may be said to have begun with the arrival of Fra Angelico (see Fiesole) in 1447, invited by Nicholas V. to paint the Avails of his small private chapel in the Vatican dedicated to S. Lorenzo.

To Mino da Fiesole (see Mino nι Giovanni, vol. xvi. p. 477), who spentseveral years in Rome between 1470 and 1484, and other Florentine sculptors are due almost all the very beautiful sculptured tombs which λvere made for a large number of the Roman churches during the last thirty years of the 15th century, as well as many altar frontals, reredoses, tabernacles, and the like. Though varied in details, most of these tombs are designed after one type, that employed by Mino in his fine monuments in the Badia at Florence. A life-sized recumbent effigy lies on a richly ornamented sarcophagus, over which is an arched canopy decorated with reliefs; the piers which support this (usually) have statuettes in two or more tiers. Forgrace and refined beauty no type of sepulchral monument has ever equalled this Florentine design. The peaceful attitude and calm face of the effigy are frequently of the most perfect beauty, and the minute statuettes and reliefs are finished with ivory-like delicacy. Though the influence of Mino, very strongly marked, may be traced in all these numerous works (there are in Rome more than a hundred tombs of this class), yet a very small proportion can be actually by his hand. Mino created and trained a large school of sculptor-pupils in Rome, some of whom appear almost to have equalled their master in skill; and it is to them that most of these works must be referred. A very long list of churches containing sculpture of this class might be given; perhaps the richest are S. Maria in Monserrato (the cloisters) and S. Maria del Popolo. ^[772. IJandhnoii of liai. Sculpt., Monumenti Saeri,]

The architecture no less than the sculpture of the latter part of the 15th century was mainly the work of Florentines, especially of Baccio Pintelli, who partly rebuilt S. Maria del Popolo, S. Agostino, ^[773.] and S. Cosimato in Trastevere. He also was the architect of S. Pietro in Montorio, erected in 1500 for Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, and probably designed the Sistine chapel for Sixtus IV. in 1473. Other buildings were carried out by another Florentine, Giuliano da Majano (see Ferrerio, Palazzi di Ronιa, 1825). The Palazzo di Venezia, begun for Cardinal Barbo, afterwards Paul IL, about 1455, a very massive and stately building of mediaeval character, was designed by Francesco di Borgo San Sepolcro.

During the latter part of the 15th and the first few years of the succeeding century Rome was enriched with a number of buildings by Bramante iq.υ. ), one of the greatest architects the world has ever seen. With the most consummate skill, he combined the delicacy of detail and the graceful lightness of the Gothic style with the measured stateliness and rhythmical proportions of classic architecture. Though lie invariably used the round arch and took his mouldings from antique sources, his beautiful cloisters and Ioggie are Gothic in their general conception. Moreover, he never committed the prevalent blunder of the 16th century, which was a fruitless attempt to obtain magnificence by mere size in a building, without multiplying its parts. His principal works in Rome are the magnificent Palazzo della Cancelleria, built for Cardinal

Riario in 1495, with its stately church of S. Lorenzo in Damaso; the so-called Palazzo di Bramante in the Governo Vecchio, built in 1500; and the Palazzo Giraud, near St Γeter , s, once the residence of Cardinal Wolsey, built in 1506. He also built the cortile of S. Damaso in the Vatican, the toy-like tempietto in the cloister of S. Pietro in Montorio, and'the cloisters of S. Maria della Pace, 1504. ^[774.] In 1503 Bramante was appointed architect to St Peter’s, and made complete designs for it, with a plan in the form of a Greek cross. The piers and arches of the central dome were the only parts completed at the time of his death in 1514, and subsequent architects did not carry out his design. For St Peter’s, see Architecture, vol. ii. p. 438 and plates XXII., XXIIL; also Basilica, vol. iii. p. 415 sq.

Baldassare Peruzzi {q.v. ) of Siena was one of the most talented architects of the first part of the 16th century; the Villa Farnesina and the Palazzo Vidoni (usually attributed to Raphael) are from his designs. ^[775.] His later works bear traces of that decadence in taste which so soon began, owing mainly to the rapidly growing love for the dull magnificence of the pseudo-classic style. This falling oft' in architectural taste was due to Michelangelo (g , .τ.) more than to any other one man. His cortile of the Farnese palace, though a work of much stately beauty, was one of the first stages towards that lifeless scholasticism and blind following of antique forms which were the destruction of architecture as a real living art, and in the succeeding century produced so much that is almost brutal in its coarseness and neglect of all true canons of proportion and scale. During the earlier stage, however, of this decadence and throughout the 16th century a large number offine palaces and churches were built in and near Rome by various able artists, such as the Villa Madama by Raphael, part of the Palazzo Farnese by Antonio da Sangallo the younger, S. Giovanni de’ Fiorentini by Jac. Sansovino, and many others. ^[776. RaJfaello come Architetto, Edifices modernes à Rome, Édifices de Home moderne,]

4. Modern Period.

Under Vignola (1507-1573), Carlo Maderna (1556-1639), Bernini (1598-1680), Carlo Fontana (1634-1714), and others architectural beauty in Rome steadily declined, till the prevalent style became a mere caricature of classical forms, twisted and contorted into every possible incongruous and ridiculous shape, void of all sense of harmony of proportion and unredeemed by any grace or even decency of detail. Clumsy weightiness and extravagance of outline, with the frequent introduction of the most ungraceful curves, are the main characteristics of this unhappy period, which, unfortunately, was one of great activity in building. The degraded taste of the 17th and 18th centuries could see no beauty in the stately simplicity of the early basilicas, in the delicate grace and rich ornament of the Cosmati period, or even in the refined harmonious beauty of the Renaissance. ^[777.] Every church in Rome is more or less disfigured inside with extravagant stucco pilasters and reliefs, transfiguring the whole interior, while outside many have clumsy façades stuck on without the slightest reference to the structures they are meant to decorate. The Lateran basilica is one of the most conspicuous instances of this sad treatment of a grand old building; and the hideous façades which disfigure the fine churches of S. Marcello and S. Maria in Via Lata (both in the Corso) are typical examples of the degradation into which architecture had sunk in its latest stages. In the present century taste has somewhat improved. Since 1870, when Rome became the capital, an immense amount of building has been carried out, mostly innocent in design, though dull and lifeless. The modern architects of Rome possess the rare merit'of acknowledging their own artistic incapacity, and the more important recent buildings have been copies, fairly faithful in design though not in material, of fine palaces of the best 15th and 16th century architects. The Cassa di Risparmio in the Corso and some large houses in the new quarter across the Tiber are good copies of the Strozzi and other Florentine palaces; the Hotel Bristol is from a fine palace at Venice; and Bramante’s Palazzo Giraud has been imitated in a new house near the Piazza Nicosia. Unfortunately stucco is mainly used for the exteriors of these otherwise handsome buildings, a material which, however, lasts fairly well in the mild climate of Rome. The growing rage for the Parisian style of building, with wide straight boulevards, is rapidly destroying all the picturesqueness of the city; and these broad streets, from their want of shade, are not suited to an almost constantly sunny climate.

The chief architectural work of the 19th century has been [9:20:837]the rebuilding of the nave of the great basilica of S. Γaolo fuori Ie Mura, burnt in 1823, in a style of great splendour, though somewhat cold in effect. Its columns are enormous monoliths of grey granite from the Alps; the confessio and transepts are lined with rosso and verde antico from the recently rediscovered quarries in Greece, and with Egyptian alabaster. The reconsecration of this magnificent edifice took place in 1854, after thirty years had been spent in the rebuilding; the east façade, with its new gaudy mosaics, and the atrium are not yet complete. ^[778. La Basilica Ostiensc,] Another great work still in progress is the extension of the sanctuary of the Lateran basilica, which unhappily has involved the destruction of the ancient apse and its ambulatory, the only part of the church which had escaped complete disfigurement. The priceless mosaics of the apse (1290), among the most 'beautiful in Rome, have been refixed in the new apse, but of course in a sadly modernized and restored form. ^[779. Ann. Inst.,] Some large blocks of Government offices on the Esquiline Hill are the most important in size among the recent constructions. They have little architectural merit either in design, materials, or solidity of workmanship.

The Vatican contains the largest collection in the world of Groeco-Roman and Roman sculpture, with a .few specimens of true Hellenic art. It is also very rich in Greek vases and in objects from Etruscan tombs; this latter division is called the Museo Gregoriano. There is also an Egyptian museum. In the great library are preserved a number of early glass chalices ^[780. Vetri Ornati in Oro,] and other rare objects from the catacombs, as well as many fine specimens of later Christian art,—church plate and jewels. The picture gallery, though not as large as some of the private collections in Rome, contains few inferior pictures. The Lateran palace, still, like the Vatican, in the possession of the pope, contains a fine collection of classical sculpture, but is most remarkable as a museum of Christian antiquities. The two Capitoline museums are very rich in classical sculpture, bronzes, coins, pottery, and the contents of early Etruscan and Latin tombs. A large hall has lately been added, and is filled with sculpture found on the Esquiline since 1870. The picture gallery contains a few masterpieces and a large number of inferior works. A new museum is now (1886) being formed in the great cloister of S. Maria degli Angeli to hold the numerous fine examples of classical painting and sculpture found along the Tiber during the excavations for the new embankment, and in other places in Rome. The university of Rome possesses fine collections of minerals, fossils, and other geological specimens, and examples of ancient marbles used in the buildings of Rome.

A new Museo Artistico has recently been formed in a monastery in the Capo Ie Case, to contain mediaeval works of art; it will probably be rapidly increased. The Museo Kircheriano is in some respects unique of its kind. It contains an unrivalled collection of prehistoric objects found in Italy and its islands, in stone, bronze, iron, and pottery. The collection of aes grave is the finest yet made; and the museum also contains a large quantity of interesting classical antiquities of various kinds. Another branch is the Ethnological Museum, as yet of no great importance. Unfortunately all these museums are badly adapted for purposes of study, being neither well arranged nor catalogued.

Among the private collections of pictures the Borghese is quite unrivalled. The next in importance is that in the Doria palace, which, however, like most Italian collections, contains a large proportion of very inferior works. The Corsini picture gallery, lately bought by the municipality of Rome, is chiefly rich in the works of the Bolognese and other third-rate painters. The Bar-berini and Sciarra-Colonna palaces contain a few fine paintings; those in the latter collection are now’ arranged in the ow τ ner's private apartments, and are not visible to the public.

The largest private collection of sculpture is that of the Villa Albani, which, among a large mass of inferior Roman sculpture, contains a few gems of Greek art. The original Albani collection was stolen and brought to Paris by Napoleon I., and was there dispersed; one relief, the celebrated Antinous, is the only piece of sculpture from the original collection which was sent back from Paris. The owner of this is now Prince Torlonia, who also possesses a very large collection of classical sculpture formed by himself; it contains several very fine works, but unfortunately the greater number are much injured and falsified by restorations. The casino in the Borghese gardens possesses a great quantity of sculpture, mostly third-rate Roman works. The small collection of the Villa Ludovisi ^[781.] contains a few works of Greek sculpture of the highest importance, of which the chief are the Pergamean group of the suicide of the Gaulish chief, a relief of Medusa’s head, and a male terminal figure. Many other palaces, such as that of the Colonna family, contain less important collections of sculpture and painting..

Population, Climate, <f,∙e. ^[782. The Roman Climate, Health, and Disease, Monografia di Roma] —In the sixteen years which have elapsed since Rome became the capital of Italy (1870-1886) the population has largely increased, chiefly owing to the introduction of a great number of Government officials with their families from Northern Italy. Under the last papal census the number of inhabitants was 216,000; in 1881 it had increased to 276,463. Education of the working classes has much improved in these years, and there are now nearly 170 parochial schools. The streets are remarkable for their cleanliness, and are mostly well paved with hard lava and well lighted with gas. For municipal purposes Rome is still divided into the fourteen mediaeval “rioni”; these, though corresponding in number with the fourteen regiones of Augustus, include very different areas. The climate is mild and sunny, in winter averaging 10° Fahr, above the temperature of London; but the variation between day and night is very great. The coldest months are December and Febmary (average temp. 47°); the hottest are Julyand August (average 75°). The rainfall is slight, averaging 16,,th inches annually, and the rainy days are few proportionally. On the whole Rome is a healthy city, in spite of some malaria, usually confined to its more open parts. ^[783. HIgiene di Roma, Atti delta Giunta per la Inchiesta Agraria, Etudes Statistiques sur Rome,] The neighbouring Campagna is in parts almost uninhabitable during the summer from this cause; but the malaria is much checked by the planting of eucalyptus trees, which grow rapidly in and about the city. A very remarkable instance of this is the Trappist nιonasteιy of the Tre Fontane, about 4 miles from Rome on the Ostian road, which a few years ago was quite uninhabitable in the summer, while since a number of these trees have been planted the monks reside there with impunity throughout the year. Though almost free from typhus, there is a good deal of enteric fever in Rome, partly owing to the very unwholesome arrangement of the drainage in each house, though the general system of sewerage is good. That this disease is not more prevalent is probably owing to the magnificent water-supply ^[784. Le Fontane di Roma,] which flows in a constant service, thus doing away with the necessity of cisterns. The average annual deaths are 5750.
