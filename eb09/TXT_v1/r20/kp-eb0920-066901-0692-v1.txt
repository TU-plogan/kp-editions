ROMAN LAW

CHAPTER I.—THE REGAL PERIOD.

Contributories to People, Customs, and Law.— The union of the Latin, Sabine, and, to a small extent, Etruscan bands that, as conquerors or conquered, old settlers or new immigrants, together constituted the first elements of the Roman people, did not necessarily involve contemporaneous adoption of identical institutions or identical notions of law. Although they were descended from the same Indo-European stock, and inherited the same primitive ideas about religion and government, those ideas must have been modified in the course of centuries of separate and independent development. The characteristics of the Latin race are said to have been its sense of the importance of discipline and the homage it paid to power and might; those of the Sabines were their religious feeling and their reverence for the gods; the characteristic of the Etruscans was their subservience to forms and ceremonies in matters both divine and human. Corresponding influences are very manifest in the growth of Rome’s early public institutions, civil, military, and religious. It does not seem too much to say that these same influences are traceable also in the institutions of the private law. The patria potestas, with the father’s power of life and death over his children; the manus and the husband’s power over his wife; the doctrine that those things chiefly was a man entitled to call his own which he had taken by the strength of his arm; the right which a creditor had of apprehending and imprisoning his defaulting debtor and reducing him to slavery,—all these seem to point to a persuasion that might made right. The religious marriage ceremony and the recognition of the wife as mistress of the household and participant in its sacred offices as well as its domestic cares; the family council of kinsmen, maternal as well as paternal, who advised the paterfamilias in the exercise of the domestic jurisdiction; the practice of adoption, to obviate the extinction of a family and to prevent its deceased members being deprived of the prayers and sacrifices necessary for the repose of their souls,—these seem to have flowed from a different order of ideas and to bear evidence of Sabine descent. Etruscan influence could make itself felt only at a later date; but to it may possibly be attributed the strict regard that came to be required to the observance of ceremonials and words of style in the more important transactions both of public and private life.

While it can hardly be doubted that the result of the union of Latins and Sabines was that regulations were at once adopted which should apply to their public life as a united people, it is not only conceivable but probable that each tribe, as regarded the private relations of its members, continued for a time to accord a preference to its own ideas and traditions of right and law, and that the amalgamation was a gradual process, partly silent, partly due to regal or pontifical intervention.

Patricians, Clients, and Plebeians.— There was part of the law of Rome that even in the empire was known by the name of Jus Quimtium, the Law of the Spearmen; and this in the regal period constituted its main element. The Quirites were the members of the gentile houses, organized in their curies, primarily for military and secondarily for political purposes. They alone of the rapidly increasing population settled round the urbs guad-rata ranked as citizens, down at least to the time of Servius Tullius. They alone could consult the gods through the medium of auspicia, and participate in the services offered to the tutelary deities of Rome. From their number the king drew his council of elders, and they alone could take part in the curiate comitia, the assembly of the warriors. They alone could contract a lawful marriage and make a testament; in a word, it was they alone that were entitled directly to the benefit of Rome’s peculiar institutions.

These prerogatives they enjoyed as members of the gentile houses. Patrician Rome was a federation of g entes or clans, the clans aggregations of families bearing a common name, and theoretically at least tracing their descent from a common ancestor. Whether or not the traditional account of the numerical proportion of families to clans and of clans to curies has any substantial historical foundation, and whatever may be the explanation of the method by which the symmetry on which the old writers dwell with so much complacency was attained, it is beyond doubt that the gentile organization was common to the two races at least that contributed most largely to the citizenship of Rome, and that it was made the basis of the new arrangements. Federation necessitated the appointment of a common chieftain and common institutions, religious, military, political, and judicial. But it was long before these displaced entirely the separate institutions of the federated gentes. Every clan had its own cult, peculiar to its own members; this was the universal bond of association in those early times. It had its common property and its common burial-place. It must have had some common council or assembly, for we read not only of special gentile customs but of gentile statutes and decrees. Instances are on record of wars waged by individual gentes ; so they must have had the right to require military service alike from their gentiles and gentilicii. Widows and orphans of deceased clansmen were under the guardianship of the gens, or of some particular member of it to whom the trust was specially confided. If a clansman left no heirs, his property passed to his fellow gentiles. Over the morals of its members the gens exercised supervision and discipline, interfering to prevent prodigality and improvidence, restraining abuses of the domestic authority, and visiting with censure and probably in grave cases with punishment any breach of faith or other dishonourable conduct; and it is difficult to suppose that, within its own limits, it was not constantly called upon, through the medium of its chief, to act the part of peacemaker and arbiter. Finally, its members were always entitled to rely upon its assistance, to have maintenance when indigent, to be ransomed from captivity, to be upheld in their just disputes and quarrels, and to be avenged when killed or injured.

The successes of the burgesses in one petty war after another deprived many small communities of their independent existence, leaving their members bereft alike of their religion, their territory, and their means of subsistence. These had to turn elsewhere for protection, and in large numbers they sought it from their conquerors. To many others, both voluntary immigrants and refugees from other cities, the new settlement proved a centre of attraction. It was quite ready to receive them, but as subjects only, not as citizens. Following a custom familiar to both Latins and Sabines, the new-comers invoked the protection of the heads of patrician families of repute, to whom they attached themselves as free vassals. The relationship was known as that of patron and client. (See Patron and Client, vol. xviii. p. 412.) The client became a dependent member of his patron’s clan,—not gentilis, however, but only gentilicius. His patron had to provide him with all that was necessary for his sustenance and that of his wife [9:20:670]and children; and, as private holdings increased in extent, it was not unusual for the patron or his gens to give him during pleasure a plot of land to cultivate for himself. The patron had, moreover, to assist him in his transactions with third parties, obtain redress for him for his injuries, and represent him before the tribunals when he became involved in litigation. The client, on the other hand, had to maintain his patron’s interests by every means in his power. But the advantage must have been chiefly on the side of the client, who, without becoming a citizen, obtained directly the protection of his patron and his clan, and indirectly that of the state.

The plebeians, as distinguished from the clients, must be regarded as a heterogeneous mass of non-gentile freemen, small probably in numbers at first, but augmenting with ever greater rapidity, who had of choice or compulsion made Rome their domicile, but declined to subject themselves to a patron. That there was any general cohesion amongst them before the time of Servius there is not the slightest reason to believe. They were of different races, settling in Rome from different motives, practising in many matters different customs. The bulk of them, however, λvere undoubtedly Latins, with traditions and customs much the same as those of the greater number of the patrician houses; and this it was that in time caused the triumph of Latinism and the predominance of the masterful spirit in thejws Quintium. But by the ruling caste those traditions and customs were simply ignored; till the time of Servius what protection the plebeians got was simply of the grace of the kings, whose policy it was to conciliate them as a body that in time might be a valuable auxiliary against the pretensions of the patricians.

The Regulatives of Public and Private Order.— We look in vain for, and it would be absurd to expect, any definite system of law in those early times. What passed for it was a composite of fas, jus, and boni mores, whose several limits and characteristics it is extremely difficult to define. This may to some extent be accounted for by the fact that much of what was originally within the domain of fas, once it had come to be enforced by secular tribunals, and thus had the sanction of human authority, was no longer distinguishable from jus ; while it may be that others of its behests, once pontifical punishments for their contravention had gone into desuetude, sank to nothing higher than precepts of boni mores.

By fas was understood the will of the gods, the laws given by heaven for men on earth, much of it regulative of ceremonial, but a by no means insignificant part embodying rules of conduct. It appears to have had a wider range than jus. There were few of its commands, prohibitions, or precepts that were addressed to men as citizens of any particular state; all mankind came within its scope. It forbade that a war should be undertaken without the prescribed fetial ceremonial, and required that faith should be kept even with an enemy when a promise had been made to him under sanction of an oath. It enjoined hospitality to foreigners, because the stranger guest was presumed, equally with his entertainer, to be an object of solicitude to a higher power. It punished murder, for it was the taking of a god-given life; the sale of a wife by her husband, for she had become his partner in all things human and divine; the lifting of a hand against a parent, for it was subversive of the first bond of society and religion,—the reverence due by a child to those to whom he owed his existence; incestuous connexions, for they defiled the altar; the false oath and the broken vow, for they were an insult to the divinities invoked; the displacement of a boundary or a landmark, not so much because the act was provocative of feud, as because the march-stone itself, as the guarantee of peaceful neighbourhood, was under the guardianship of the gods. When an offence against any of these rules or prohibitions was inexpiable, the punishment was usually what is called sacratio capitis, excommunication and outlawry of the offender. The homo sacer was in every sense of the word an outcast,—one with whom it was pollution to associate, who dared take no part in any of the institutions of the state, civil or religious, whose life the gods would not accept as a sacrifice, but whom, nevertheless, any one might put to death with impunity as no longer god-protected. The precepts of the fas therefore were not mere exhortations to a blameless life, but closely approached to laws, whose violation was visited with punishments none the less effective that they were religious rather than civil.

Recent philology derives the word jus from the Sanscrit ju, to “join, bind, or unite,” from which some deduce as its signification “that which binds,” “the bond of society,” others “that which is regular, orderly, or fitting.” The latest inquirer (M. Bréal) identifies it with the jos, jaos, or jaus of the Vedas, and the jaes of the Zend-Avesta,—words whose exact meaning is controverted, but which he interprets as “the divine will.” Jubeo is generally allowed to be a contraction of jus hibeo, “hold or take as jus .” If Bréal’s definition can be adopted we obtain a very significant interpretation of the words addressed by the presiding magistrate to the assembled comitia in asking them whether they assented to a law proposed by him,— Velitis, jubeatis, Quintes, &c., “Is it your pleasure, Quirites, and do you hold it as the divine will, that,” and so on. As legislation by the comitia of the curies and centuries was regarded as a divine office, and their vote might be nullified by the fathers on the ground that there had been a defect in the auspicia, and the will of the gods consequently not clearly ascertained, this explanation of Bréal’s seems not without support,— vox populi vox dei. If it be right, then the only difference between fas and jus was that the will of the gods, which both embodied, was in the one declared by inspired and in the other by merely human agency.

This jus might be the result either of traditional and inveterate custom (jus monbus constitutum) or of statute (lex). ^[1. lex. lex publica (lex private), lex mancipii, lex contractus, lex testementi, ∖tyι∣,v, lex publica lex private per aes et libram, uti lingua nuneupassit Nuncupate Fontes jur. rom. antiqui,] We look in vain for any legislative enactment establishing such an institution, for example, as the patna potestas, or fixing the rules of succession on death. Statute may have regulated some of their details; but they had taken shape and consistency before Rome had its beginning. It can well be believed, however, that in the outset the customs in observance may have been far from uniform, that not only those of the different races but those also of the different gentes may at first have varied in some respects, but undergoing a gradual approximation, and in course of time consolidating into a general jus Quintium. That the bulk of the law was customary is universally admitted. But Pomponius speaks of certain laws enacted by the comitia of the curies, which he calls leges regiαe and which, he says, were collected by one Sext. Papirius in the reign of one of the Tarquins, under the name of Jus Papirianum. The opinion of the best authorities is that it is a mistake to attribute these so-called “royal laws” to that assembly. According to the testimony of the old writers it had very little share in the work [9:20:671]of legislation. Romulus jura dedit at his own hand, not jura tulit. Mommsen is probably near the mark when he describes the leges regiae as mostly rules of the fas which were of interest not merely for the pontiffs but for the public, with which it was of importance that the latter should be acquainted, that they might know the risks they incurred from their contravention. ^[2. Ueber die Leges Regiae, Transactions sq. Jus Papirianum (Dig.] It is not to be assumed that there was no legislation beyond this; some of the laws of which we have record were of a different character. But on the whole it seems beyond doubt that it was custom rather than statute that was the main factor of the jus of the regal period.

What went by the name of boni mores, quite distinct from the jus moribus constitutum, must also be regarded as one of the regulatives of public and private order. Part of what fell within their sphere might also be expressly regulated by fas or jus ; but there was much that was only gradually brought within the domain of these last, and even down to the end of the republic not a little that remained solely under the guardianship of the family tribunal or the censor’s regimen morum. Its function was twofold: sometimes it operated in restraint of law by condemning—though it could not prevent—the ruthless and unnecessary exercise of legal right, as, for example, that of the head of a house over his dependants; and sometimes it operated supplementarily, by requiring observance of duties that could not be enforced by any compulsitor of law. Dutiful service, respect, and obedience from inferiors to superiors, chastity, and fidelity to engagements, express or implied (Jides), were among the officia that were thus inculcated, and whose neglect or contravention not only affected the reputation but often entailed punishments and disabilities, social, political, or religious. It was the duty of those in authority to enforce their observance by such animadυersio as they thought proper,—the paterfamilias in his family, the gens among its members, the king in relation to the citizens generally; and many a wrong was prevented not by the fear of having to make reparation to the party injured but by the dread of the penalties that would follow conduct unbecoming an upright citizen.

The Quiritian Family.— The word familia in Roman law had at once a more extensive and a more limited meaning than it has in its English form. ^[3. Familia paterfamilias. gens αdgnatus proximus fαmiliam habeto; familia urbana, familia mιstiea.] Husband, wife, and children did not necessarily constitute an independent family among the Romans, nor were they all necessarily of the same one. Those formed a family who were all subject to the right or power—originally manus, ^[4. manus, filiusfamilias Ae potestas,] but latterly jus— of the same family head (^paterfamilias). He might have a whole host dependent on him,—wife and sons and daughters, and daughters-in-law, and grandchildren by his sons, and possibly remoter descendants related through males; so long as they remained subject to him they constituted but one family, that was split up only on his death or loss of citizenship. But if his wife had not passed in mαnum— and that was common enough even during the republic, and universal in the later empire —she did not become a member of his family: she remained a member of the family in which she was born, or, if its head was deceased or she had been emancipated, was the sole member of a family of her own. Both sons and daughters on emancipation ceased to be of the family of the paterfamilias who had emancipated them. A daughter’s children could never under any circumstances be members of the family of their maternal grandfather; for children born in lawful marriage followed the family of their father, while those who were illegitimate ranked from the moment of birth as p>atresfamilias and matres-familias.

With the early Romans, as with the Hindus and the Greeks, marriage was a religious duty a man owed alike to his ancestors and to himself. Believing that the happiness of the dead in another world depended on their proper burial and on the periodical renewal by their descendants of prayers and feasts and offerings for the repose of their souls, it was incumbent upon him above all things to perpetuate his race and his family cult. In taking to himself a wife, he was about to detach her from her father’s house and make her a partner of his family mysteries. With the patrician at least this was to be done only with divine approval, ascertained by auspicia. His choice was limited to a woman with whom he had coηubium (iπcγαpiα) or right of intermarriage. This was a matter of state arrangement; and in the regal period Roman citizens could have it outside their own bounds only with members of .states with which they were in alliance, and with which they were connected by the bond of common religious observances. A patrician citizen, therefore, if his marriage was to be reckoned lawful (ffustae nuptiae), had to wed either a fellow-patrician or a woman who was a member of an allied community. The ceremony was a religious one, conducted by the high priests of the state, in presence of ten witnesses, representatives probably of the ten curies of the bridegroom’s tribe, and was known as confarreatio. Its effect was to dissociate the wife entirely from her father’s house and to make her a member of her husband’s; for confarreate marriage involved what was called in maηum conventio, the passage of the wife into her husband’s “hand” or power, provided he was himself paterfamilias; if he was not, then, though nominally in his hand, she was really subject like him to his family head. Any property she had of her own—which was a possible state of matters only if she had been independent before marriage—passed to him as a matter of course; if she had none, her paterfamilias provided her a dowry (ffos), which shared the same fate. Whatever she acquired by her industry or otherwise while the marriage lasted also as a matter of course fell to her husband. In fact, so far as her patrimonial interests were concerned, she was in much the same position as her children; and on her husband’s death she had a share with them in his inheritance as if she had been one of his daughters. In other respects manus conferred more limited rights than patria potestas ; for Romulus is said to have ordained that, if a man put away his wife except for adultery or one of two or three other very grave offences, he forfeited his estate half to her and half to Ceres, while if he sold her he was to be given over to the infernal gods.

The patria potestas was the name given to the power exercised by a father, or by his paterfamilias if he was himself in potestate, over the issue of such justoe nuptiae.
[9:20:672]

The Roman jurists boasted that it was a right enjoyed by none but Roman citizens; and it certainly was peculiar to them in this sense, that nowhere else, except among the Latin race from which they had sprung, did the paternal power attain such an intensity. The omnipotence of the paterfamilias and the condition of utter subjection to him of his children in potestate became greatly modified under the empire; but originally the children, though in public life on an equality with the house father, in private life, and so long as the potestas lasted, λvere subordinated to him to such an extent as, according to the letter of the law, to be in his hands little better than his slaves. They could have nothing of their own: all they earned was his; and, though it was quite common when they grew up for him to give them peculia, “cattle of their own,” to manage for their own benefit, these were only de facto theirs, but de jure his. For offences committed by them outside the family circle, for which he was not prepared to make amends, he had to surrender them to the injured party, just like slaves or animals that had done mischief. If his right to them was disputed he used the same action for its vindication that he employed for asserting his ownership of his field or his house: if they were stolen, he proceeded against the thief by an ordinary action of theft; if for any reason he had to transfer them to a third party, it was by the same form of conveyance that he used for the transfer of things inanimate. Nor was this all; for, according to the old formula recited in that sort of adoption known as adrogation, he had over them the power of life and death, jus vitae necisgue. This power was subject to certain restrictions during the infancy of a child; but, when he had grown up, his father, in the exercise of his domestic jurisdiction, might visit his misconduct, not only in private but in public life, with such punishment as he thought fit, even banishment, slavery, or death.

It might happen that a marriage was fruitless, or that a man saw all his sons go to the grave before him, and that the paterfamilias had thus to face the prospect of the extinction of his family and of his own descent to the tomb without posterity to make him blessed. To obviate so dire a misfortune he resorted to the practice of adoption, so common in India and Greece. If it was a pater-familias that he adopted the process was called adrogation (gιdrogatio) ; if it was a filiusfamilias it was simply adoptio. The latter, unknown probably in the earlier regal period, was a somewhat complicated conveyance of a son by his natural parent to his adopter, the purpose of course being expressed; its effect was simply to transfer the child from the one family to the other. But the former was much more serious, for it involved the extinction of one family ^[5. paterfamilias ,,] that another might be perpetuated. It was therefore an affair of state. It had to be approved by the pontiffs, who probably had to satisfy themselves that there were brothers enough of the adrogatee to attend to the interests of the ancestors whose cult he was renouncing; and on their favourable report it had to be sanctioned by a vote of the curies, as it involved the deprivation of his gens of their possible right of succession to him. The result was that the adrogatus, from being himself the head of a house, sank to the position of a filiusfamilias in the house of his adopting parent; if he had had wife or children subject to him, they passed with him into his new family, and so did everything that belonged to him and that was capable of transmission from one person to another. The adopting parent acquired potestas and power of life and death over the adopted child exactly as if he were the issue of his body; while the latter enjoyed in his new family the same rights exactly that he would have had if he had been born in it.

The manus and the patria potestas represent the masterful aspects of the patrician’s domestic establishment. Its conjugal and parental ones, however, though not so prominent in the pages of the jurists, are not to be lost sight of. The Roman family in the early history of the law was governed as much by fas as by jus. It was an association hallowed by religion, and held together not by might merely but by conjugal affection, parental piety, and filial reverence. The purpose of marriage was to rear sons who might perpetuate the house and the family sacra. In entering into the relationship the wife renounced her rights and privileges as a member of her father’s house; but it was that she might enter into a lifelong partnership with her husband, and be associated with him in all his family interests, sacred and civil. The husband was priest in the family, but wife and children alike assisted in its prayers, and took part in the sacrifices to its lares and penates. As the Greek called his wife the house-mistress, δeσ-7r0u'α, so did the Roman speak of his as materfamilias, ^[6. Mαterfamiliαs sui juris, i.e., in manu mardi.] the house-mother. She was treated as her husband’s equal. As for their children, the potestas was so tempered by the natural sense of parental duty on the one side and filial affection on the other that in daily life it was rarely felt as a grievance; while the risk of an arbitrary exercise of the domestic jurisdiction, whether in the heat of passion or under the impulse of justifiable resentment, was guarded against by the rule which required the paterfamilias to consult in the first place the near kinsmen of his child, maternal as well as paternal. Even the incapacity of the subject members of the family to hold property of their own cannot in those times have been regarded as any serious hardship; for, though the legal title to all their acquisitions was in the house-father, yet in truth they were acquired for and belonged to the family as a whole, and he was but a trustee to hold and administer them for the common benefit.

In Greece the patria potestas never reached such dimensions as in Rome, and there it ceased, de facto at least, when a son had grown up to manhood and started a household of his own. But in Rome, unless the paterfamilias voluntarily put an end to it, it lasted as long as the latter lived and retained his status. The marriage of a son, unlike that of a daughter passing into the hand of a husband, did not release him from it, nor did his children become subject to him so long as he himself was in potestate. On the contrary, his wife passed on marriage into the power of her father-in-law, and their children as they were born fell under that of their paternal grandfather; and the latter was entitled to exercise over his daughters-in-law and grandchildren the same rights he had over his sons and unmarried daughters. But there was this difference, that, when the paterfamilias died, his sons and daughters who had remained in potestate and his grandchildren by a predeceased son instantly became their own masters (sui juris), whereas grandchildren by a surviving son simply passed from the potestas of their grandfather into that of their father.

The acquisition of domestic independence by the death of the family head frequently involved the substitution of the guardianship of tutors (futela) for the potestas that had come to an end. This was so invariably in the case of females sui juris, no matter what their age: they remained under guardianship until they had passed by marriage in maηum manti. It was only pupil males, however, who required tutors, and their office came to an end when puberty [9:20:673]was attained. It is doubtful whether during the regal period a testamentary appointment of tutors by a husband or parent to wife or children was known in practice,— probably not. If so the office devolved upon the gens to which the deceased paterfamilias belonged; and it may reasonably be assumed that it delegated the duties to one of its members in particular, retaining in its collective capacity a right of supervision.

The Quiritiaη Law of Property.— The distribution of land amongst the early Romans is one of the puzzling problems of their history. The Servian constitution classified the citizens and determined their privileges, duties, and burdens according to the extent of their freeholds; and yet we know very little with certainty of the way in which these were acquired. ^[7. Recherches sur le droit de propriété chez les Romains, Histoire de la propriété, du domaine publie, et des lois agraires chez les Romains, De antiquissimae agris Romani distributwnis fiele, bina jugera Rhein. Mus.f. Phü., sq., XII. Tafeln, Röm. Reehtsgesehiehte,] We have indeed a traditional account of a partition by Romulus of the little territory of his original settlement into three parts, not necessarily of equal dimensions, one of which was intended for the maintenance of the state and its institutions, civil and religious, the second (ager publicus) for the use of the citizens and profit of the state, and the third (ager prrvvatus) for subdivision among his followers. Varro and Pliny further relate that to each of them he assigned a homestead (heredium) of two jugers, equal to about an acre and a quarter, to be held by him and his heirs (quae here-dem sequerentur),— Pliny adding that to none did the king give more. There can be no doubt that a portion of the territory, gradually augmented through new conquests, was reserved as ager publicus ; that is sufficiently attested by the complaints made for centuries by the plebeians of its monopolization by the patricians. But it is impossible to admit the accuracy of the account of the mode in which the ager privatus was dealt with. The fact that the majority of the Servian local tribes bore the names of well-known patrician gentes leads to the conclusion that many at least of the clans held tracts of land in their corporate capacity, and that their constituent families settled alongside each other, each with its own homestead in separate and independent right. It can hardly be assumed, however, that two and a half jugers was its maximum. Seven jugers, about 4∣ acres, seems to have been the normal extent of royal grants to plebeians, and a patrician’s freehold is not likely to have been less; probably in the ordinary case it was larger, seeing the minimum qualification for the third Servian class was ten jugers, and for the first twenty. ^[8. heredium] To enable him to make grants during pleasure to his clients he must have held more than seven. But he did not necessarily hold all his lands by gratuitous assignation either from the state or from his gens ; purchase from the former was by no means uncommon; and it may have been on his purchased lands, outside his heredium proper, that his clients were usually employed. Those dependants were also employed in large numbers upon those parts of the ager publicus which were occupied by the patricians under the name of possessioηes, and which really were the source of their wealth. These, however, were not the property of their occupant; it was the lands acquired by assignation or purchase that were alone regarded as his ex jure Qrnmtium,— what he held in independent ownership to him and his heirs according to the law and custom of the Quirites.

There are some who maintain that in the regal period, anterior to the reign of Servius Tullius, there was no private property in movables. The proposition thus broadly stated is manifestly untenable. If no more be meant by it than this, that movables were not then recognized as objects of quiritarian right that could be vindicated as such by a real action per sacramentum, it may be admitted that down to the time of Servius, with exception perhaps of captured slaves and cattle, there was no property in movables. But, if it be meant to negative the right of a man to alienate by tradition what he held as his own, and to protect himself, or have protection from the authorities, against any attempt to deprive him of it by theft or violence, then the non-existence of ownership of movables must be emphatically denied. Theft was theft, though the stolen article had been acquired only by natural means,—by barter in the market, by the industry of the maker, or as the product of something already belonging to its holder.

The Quiritiaη Law of Succession.— The legal order of succession in the regal period was extremely simple. It was this: on the death of a paterfamilias his patrimony devolved upon those of his children in potestate who by that event became sui juris, his widow taking an equal share with them, and no distinction being made between movables and immovables, personalty and realty; and, failing widow and children, it went to his gens. The notion that between the descendants and the gens came an intermediate class under the name of agnates does not seem well founded as regards the regal period; they were introduced by the XII. Tables to meet the case of the plebeians, who, having no gentes, were without legal heirs in default of children. ^[9. gens {Analecta litteraria, In Virg. Eclog.,vt. agnatis et natis in potestate gens.]

The later jurists more than once refer to the perfect equality of the sexes in the matter of succession in the ancient law. ^[10.] But it was more nominal than real. A daughter who had passed into the hand of a husband during her father’s lifetime of course could have no share in the latter’s inheritance, for she had ceased to be a member of his family. One who was in potestate at his death, and thereby became sui juris, did become his heir, unless he had prevented such a result by testamentary arrangements. But even then it was in the hands of the gens to prevent risk of prejudice to themselves: for she could not marry, and so carry her fortune into another family, without their consent as her guardians; neither could she without their consent alienate any of the more valuable items of it; nor, even with their consent, could she make a testament disposing of it in prospect of death. Her inheritance, therefore, was hers in name only; in reality it was in the hands of her guardians.

Of primogeniture or legal preference of one member of the family over the others there is not the faintest trace. And yet we find record of heredia remaining in a family not for generations merely but for centuries,—a state of matters that would have been impossible had every death of a paterfamilias necessarily involved a splitting up of the family estate. It is conceivable that this was sometimes prevented by arrangement amongst the heirs themselves;
[9:20:674]

and the practice of every now and then drafting the younger members of families to colonies diminished the number of those who had a claim to participate. But the simplest plan of avoiding the difficulty was for the paterfamilias to regulate his succession by testament; and there can be little doubt that originally such a deed was had recourse to, not so much for instituting a stranger heir when a man had no issue—according to patrician notions his duty then was to perpetuate his family by adopting a son—as for partitioning the succession when he had more children than one.

There were two sorts of testaments made use of by the patricians of the regal period,—that made in the comitia of the curies {test. calatis comitiis) and that made in the presence of a few comrades on the eve of battle {test, in prociηctu faxtunι). The first at least—and the second was just a substitute for it on an emergency—was far from being an independent exercise of the testator’s voluntas. For, though in course of time, and under the sanction of the uti legassit ita jus esto of the XII. Tables, the curies may have become merely the recipients of the oral declaration by the testator of his last will, in order that they might testify to it after his death, it is impossible not to see in the comitial testament what must originally have been a legislative act, whereby the testator’s peers, for reasons which they and the presiding pontiffs thought sufficient, sanctioned in the particular case a departure from the ordinary rules of succession. The pontiffs were there to protect the interests of religion, and the curies to protect those of the testator’s gens ; and it is hardly conceivable that a testament could have been sanctioned by them which so far set at nought old traditions as to deprive a filiusfamilias of his birthright, at least in favour of a stranger.

Family, Property, and Succession amongst the Plebeians. —If perfect identity of law and custom cannot be assumed to have existed amongst the patricians in the earliest years of Rome, far less can it be supposed to have existed amongst the heterogeneous population that constituted the plebs. A large proportion of them, it is true, were of Latin descent, to whom gentile institutions and the manus and the patria potestas of the family were nothing strange; but alongside of them were other tribes that Rome had vanquished, who had very different traditions, and some of whom, as is thought by one or two writers of note, laid more store on female kinship than on that through males. From the moment that any of the former became part of the Roman plebs everything like gentile organization was of course suppressed; public policy could not suffer the continuance of what might have proved an element of danger to the state. The inevitable consequence was a disturbance of the whole family system. Having no longer any clansmen to stand by them in emergencies, to avenge their quarrels and deaths, and to act as guardians of their widows and orphans, the plebeians of Latin origin seem to have drawn closer in their ideas to their fellows of Etruscan and Hellenic descent, and to have transferred their regards to the circle of their relatives by blood and marriage {cognati et adfines). It is remarkable that, notwithstanding the pre-eminence given to agnates by the XII. Tables in matters of tutory and succession, the law reserved to the cognates, as distinguished from the agnates, certain rights and duties that in patrician Rome must have belonged to the gens,— for example, the duty of prosecuting the murderer (originally of avenging the death) of a kinsman, and the right of appeal against a capital sentence pronounced upon a kinsman. This can only have been because in olden times, when agnation was unknown as distinct from the gens, it was plebeian practice to entrust those rights and duties to the sobrinal circle of cognates. ^[11. Das Familienrecht der Cοgnatxn und Affinen nαeh rom. u. verwandten Rechten,]

In the discussions on the Canuleian law in the year 309

u.c. it suited the line of argument of patrician orators to decry plebeian unions as something not deserving of the name of nuptiae, and to stigmatize them as mere matm-ηιonia,— relations entered into between men and women for the sake of making the latter mothers, but involving none of those features that characterized patrician marriage. ^[12. patridi cοnubium,] That there may have been laxity amongst many of the plebeians in their domestic relations is extremely probable. The ceremony of confarreation was denied to them, and coemption (as seems likely) was not yet invented, so that the only way of contracting a marriage that was open to them was simple interchange of consent, which was not legally creative of manus. Whether it was creative of patria potestas over the issue of the union may be doubted. Some of the plebeians may have been of opinion that it did create it and may de facto have exercised the right it conferred, while others may have been indifferent as to whether it did or not; but we may be very sure that the patricians denied its possibility, on the ground that it was a prerogative of Roman citizens, amongst whom the plebeians had no claim to rank.

The accounts of the early distributions of land amongst the plebeians are even more uncertain than those we have of its distribution amongst the patricians. They had undoubtedly become freeholders in large numbers before the Servian reforms. But they probably attained that position only by gradual stages. There are indications that their earliest grants from the kings in their character of royal clients (as Cicero calls them) were only during pleasure; but latterly, as they increased in numbers and importance, they obtained concessions of heredia varying in extent from two to seven jugers. That those who had the means also frequently acquired land by purchase from the state may be taken for granted. In fact there is good reason to believe that by the time of Servius the plebeians were as free to hold land in private property as the patricians, although the stages by which they reached equality in this respect are uncertain and difficult to follow. As for movable property their rights in it were presumably the same as those of the patricians.

As regards the law of succession it may safely be assumed that by custom at all events the children of a plebeian usually took his estate on his death. But, as he was not a member of a gens, there was no provision for the devolution of his succession on failure of children. The want of them he could not supply by adrogation, as he had for long no access to the assembly of the curies; and it is very doubtful if adoption of a filiusfamilias was known before the reforms of Servius Tullius. The same cause that disqualified him for adrogating a paterfamilias disqualified him for making a testament calatis comitiis ; and even one in procinctu was impossible, since, although before the time of Servius plebeians may occasionally have served in the army, they were not citizens, and so had not the requisite capacity for making a testament. Until therefore the XII. Tables introduced the succession of agnates a plebeian unsurvived by children was necessarily heirless,— that is to say, heirless in law. But custom seems to have looked without disfavour on the appropriation of his heredium by an outsider: a brother or other near kinsman would have the earliest opportunity, and, if he maintained his possession of it in the character of heir for a reasonable period, fixed by the XII. Tables at a year, the law dealt with him as heir, and in course of time the pontiffs imposed upon him the duty of maintaining the family sacra. This was the origin, and a very innocent and laudable one,
[9:20:675]

of the usucapio pro herede, which Gaius condemns as an incomprehensible and infamous institution, and which undoubtedly lost some of its raison d'etre once the right of succession of agnates had been introduced.

Contract and its Breach.— To speak of a law of obligations in connexion with the regal period, in the sense in which the words were understood in the later jurisprudence, would be a misapplication of language. It would be going too far to say, however, as is sometimes done, that before the time of Servius Rome had no law of contract; for men must have bought and sold, or at least bartered, from earliest times,—must have rented houses, hired labour, made loans, carried goods, and been parties to a variety of other transactions inevitable amongst a people engaged to any extent in pastoral, agricultural, or trading pursuits. It is true that a patrician family with a good establishment of clients and slaves had within itself ample machinery for supplying its ordinary wants, and was thus to a great extent independent of outside aid. But there were not many such families; and the plebeian farmers and the artisans of the guilds were in no such fortunate position. There must therefore have been contracts and a law of contract; but the latter was very imperfect. In barter—for at that time money was not yet in use—with instant exchange and delivery of one commodity against another, the transaction was complete at once without the creation of any obligation. But in other cases, such as those alluded to, one of the parties at least must have trusted to the good faith of the other. What was his guarantee, and what remedy had he for breach of engagement?

His reliance in the first place was on the probity of the party with whom he was dealing,—on the latter’s reverence for Fides, and the dread he had of the disapprobation of his fellows should he prove false, and of the penalties, social, religious, or pecuniary, that might consequently be imposed on him by his gens in the case of a patrician, by his guild in the case of a craftsman, or by the king in the case of any other plebeian. ^[13.] If the party who had to rely on the other’s good faith was not satisfied with his promise and the grasp of the right hand that was its seal, ^[14. (e.g., H.N., In Aeη., {promittere deχtrarn,— Ueber d. Eid bei d. Römern, sq. Der sacrale Schutz im röm. Rechtsverkehr, Labeo, sq.] he might require his solemn oath ( jusjurandum) ; and it can hardly be doubted that, whatever may have been the case at a later period, in the time of the earlier kings he who forswore himself was amenable to pontifical discipline. If he preferred a more substantial guarantee, he took something in pledge or pawn from the other contractor; and, though he had no legal title to it, and so could not recover it by judicial process if he lost possession, yet so long as he retained it he had in his own hand a de facto compulsitor to performance. Upon performance he could be forced to return it or suffer a penalty,—not by reason of obligation resulting from a contract of pledge, for the law as yet recognized none, but because, in retaining it after the purpose was served for which he had received it, he was committing theft and liable to its punishment. At this stage breach of contract, as such, does not seem to have legitimated any action for damages or reparation before the civil tribunals; but it is not improbable that, where actual loss had been sustained, the injured party was permitted to resort immediately to self-redress by seizure of the wrongdoer or his goods. Such self-help was according to the spirit of the time,—not self-defence merely in presence of imminent danger, but active measures for redress of wrongs already completed.

Public and Private Offences and their Punishment.— For anything like a clear line of demarcation between crimes, offences, and civil injuries we look in vain in regal Rome. Offences against the state itself, such as trafficking with an enemy for its overthroλv {proditio) or treasonable practices at home fiperduellio), were of course matter of state concern, prosecution, and punishment from the first. But in the case of those that primarily affected an individual or his estate there was a halting between, and to some extent a confusion of, the three systems of private vengeance, sacral atonement, and public or private penalty. ^[15. De antiquissimo Rωnanorw>n jure crimiηαli, sq. Das Criminalrecht der Römer, sq. Early Roman Law: Regal Period, sq.] It has been attempted to explain the coexistence of these systems by reference to the different temperaments of the races that constituted united Rome; and this certainly is a consideration that cannot be left out of view. But the same sequence is observable in the history of the laws of other nations whose original elements were not so mixed, the later system gradually gaining ground upon the earlier and eventually overwhelming it. The remarkable thing in Rome is that private vengeance should so long not only have left its traces but really continued to be an active power. It must still have been an admitted right of the gens or kinsmen of a murdered man in the days of Numa; otherwise we should not have had that law of his providing that, where a homicide was due to misadventure, the offering to them of a ram should stay their hands. To avenge the death of a kinsman was more than a right: it was a religious duty, for his manes had to be appeased; and so strongly was this idea entertained that, even long after the state had interfered and made murder a matter of public prosecution, a kinsman was so imperatively bound to set it in motion that if he failed he was not permitted to take anything of the inheritance of the deceased. Private vengeance was lawful too at the instance of a husband or father who surprised his wife or daughter in an act of adultery; he might kill her and her paramour on the spot, though, if he allowed his wrath to cool, he could afterwards deal with her only judicially in his domestic tribunal. The talion we read of in the XII. Tables is also redolent of the vindicta privata, although practically it had become no more than a compulsitor to reparation. And even the nexal creditor’s imprisonment of his defaulting debtor (infra, p. 694), which was not abolished until the fifth century of the city, may not unfittingly, in view of the cruelties that too often attended it, be said to have savoured more of private vengeance than either punishment or procedure in reparation.

Exρiatio, supplicium, sacrαtio capitis, all suggest offences against the gods rather than against either an individual or the state. But it is difficult to draw the line between different classes of offences, and predicate of one that it was a sin, of another that it was a crime, and of a third that it was hut civil injury done to an individual. ^[16. {XII. Tafeln, deo necari, sacratiο capitis, eoηsecratio bonorum. improbitas] They ran into each other in a way that is somewhat [9:20:676]perplexing. Apparently the majority of those specially mentioned in the so-called leges regiac and other records of the regal period were regarded as violations of divine law, and the punishments appropriate to them determined upon that footing. Yet in many of them the prosecution was left to the state or to private individuals. It is not clear, indeed, that there was any machinery for public prosecution except in treason and murder,—the former because it was essentially a state offence, the latter because it was comparatively early deemed expedient to repress the blood-feud, which was apt to lead to deplorable results when friends and neighbours appeared to defend the alleged assassin. ^[17. (parricidi∣∕m) Das altrömische Parieιdiurn, Krit. Jahrbuch, sg. op. cit., sq.]

Take some of those offences whose sanction was saeratio capitis. Breach of duty resulting from the fiduciary relation between patron and client, maltreatment of a parent by his child, exposure or killing of a child by its father contrary to the Romulian rules, the ploughing up or removal of a boundary stone, the slaughter of a plough-ox,—all these were capital olfences; the offender, by the formula saeer esto, was devoted to the infernal gods. Festus says that, although the rules of divine law did not allow that he should be offered as a sacrifice to the deity he had especially offended (nee fias est eum immolari), yet he was so utterly beyond the pale of the law and its protection that any one might kill him with impunity. But, as the saeratio was usually coupled with forfeiture of the offender’s estate or part of it to religious uses, it is probable that steps were taken to have the outlawry or excommunication judicially declared, though whether by the pontiffs, the king, or the curies does not appear; such a declaration would, besides, relieve the private avenger of the incensed god of the chance of future question as to whether or not the citizen he had slain was saeer in the eye of the law.

That there must have been other wrongful acts that were regarded in early Rome as deserving of punishment or penalty of some sort, besides those visited with death, sacration, or forfeiture of estate, total or partial, cannot be doubted; no community has ever been so happy as to know nothing of thefts, robberies, and assaults. The XII. Tables contained numerous provisions in reference to them; but it is extremely probable that, down at least to the time of Servius Tullius, the manner of dealing with them rested on custom, and was in the main self-redress, restrained by the intervention of the king when it appeared to him that the injured party was going beyond the bounds of fair reprisal, and frequently bought off with a composition. When the offence was strictly within the family, the gens, and perhaps the guild, it was for those who exercised jurisdiction over those corporations to judge of the wrong and prescribe and enforce the penalty.

Effect of the Servian Reforms on the Private Law.— The aim of the constitutional, military, and financial reforms of Servius Tullius was to promote an advance towards equality between patricians and plebeians. While it may be an open question whether the institution of the comitia of the centuries was of his doing, or only a result of his arrangements in after years, it seems clear that he had it in view to admit the plebeians to some at least of the privileges of citizenship, imposing on them at the same time a proportionate share of its duties and its burdens. Privileges, duties, and burdens were alike to be measured by the citizen’s position as a freeholder; the amount of real estate with its appurtenances held by him on quiri-tarian title was to determine the nature of the military service he was to render, the extent to which he was to be liable for tribute, and, assuming Servius to have contemplated the creation of a new assembly, the influence he was to exercise in it.

To facilitate the execution of his scheme it was necessary to establish a register of the citizens (census), which should contain, in addition to a record of the strength of their families, a statement of the value of their lands and appurtenances, and which should be revised periodically. In order to ensure as far as possible certainty of title, and relieve the officials of troublesome investigations into the genuineness of every alleged change of ownership between two valuations, it was further declared—presumably by Servius—that no alleged transfer would be recognized which had not been effected publicly, with observance of certain prescribed solemnities, or else by surrender in court before the supreme magistrate. The form of conveyance thus introduced got the name of mancipium, and at a later period mancipatio, while the lands and other things that were to pass by it came to be known—whether from the first or not is of little moment—as res mancipi. Hence arose in the law of property a distinction of great importance, only abolished by Justinian more than a thousand years later, between res mancipi, which were transferable in quiritarian right only by mancipation or surrender in court, and res nee mancipi, which were transferable by simple delivery.

Mancipation is described by Gaius, but with particular reference to the conveyance of movable res mancipi, as a pretended sale in presence of five citizens as witnesses and a libripens holding a pair of copper scales. The transferee, with one hand on the thing being transferred, and using certain words of style, declared it his by purchase with an as (which he held in his other hand) and the scales (hoe acre aeneaque libra) ; and simultaneously he struck the scales with the as, which he then handed to the transferrer as figurative of the price. The principal variation when it was an immovable that was being transferred was that the mancipation did not require to be on the spot: the land was simply described by its known name in the valuation roll. Although in the time of Gaius only a fictitious sale—in fact the formal conveyance upon a relative contract—yet it was not always so. Its history is veιy simple. The use of the scales fixes its introduction to a time when coined money was not yet current, but raw copper nevertheless had become a standard of value and in a manner a medium of exchange. That, however, was not in the first days of Rome. Then, and for a long time, values were estimated in cattle or sheep, fines were imposed in them, and the deposits in the legis actio sacra· mento (infra, p. 681) took the same form. The use of copper as a substitute for them in private transactions was probably derived from Etruria. But, being only raw metal or foreign coins, it could be made available for loans or payments only when weighed in the scales: it passed by -weight, not by tale. There is no reason for supposing that the weighing was a solemnity, that it had any significance beyond its obvious purpose of enabling parties to ascertain that a vendor or borrower was getting the amount of copper for which he had bargained.

It was this practice of everyday life in private transactions that Servius adopted as the basis of his mancipatory conveyance, engrafting on it one or two new features intended to give it publicity and as it were state sanction, and thus render it more serviceable in the transfer of censuable property. Instead of the parties themselves using the scales, an impartial balance-holder, probably an official, was required to undertake the duty, and five citizens were required to attend as witnesses, who were to be the vouchers to the census officials of the regularity of the procedure. They are generally supposed to have been intended as representatives of the five classes in which Servius had distributed the population, and thus virtually of the state; and the fact that, when the parties appealed to them for their testimony, they were addressed not as testes but as Quiritxs lends some colour to this view. Servius is also credited with the introduction of rectangular pieces of copper of different but carefully adjusted weights, stamped by his authority with various devices (aes signatum), which are usually supposed to have been intended to take the place of the raw metai (aes rude) formerly in use, and so facilitate the process of weighing; but there is more reason for thinking they were cast and stamped as standards to be put into one scale, while the raw metal whose weight was to be ascertained was put into the other.

Instead, therefore, of being a fictitious sale, as Gaius describes it, and as it became after the introduction of coined money early in the 4th century, the mancipium or mancipation, as regulated by Servius, was an actual completed sale in the strictest sense of the term. What were the precise words of style addressed by the transferee to the transferrer, or what exactly the form of the ceremonial, we know not. But, as attendance during all the time that some thousands of pounds perhaps of copper were being weighed would have been an intolerable burden upon the five citizens convoked to discharge a public duty, it may be surmised that it early became the practice to have the price weighed beforehand, and then to reweigh, or pretend to reweigh, before the witnesses only a single little bit of metal (rauduseulum), which the transferee then handed to the transferrer as “the first pound and the last,” and thus representative of the whole. ^[18. solutio per aes et librarn, libripens haηe tibi librarn prvrnarn] Whatever may have been its form, how[9:20:677]ever, its effect was instant exchange of property against a price weighed in the scales. The resulting obligation on the vendor to maintain the title of the vendee, and the qualifications that might be superinduced on the conveyance by agreement of parties—the so-called leges mancipii— will be considered in connexion with the provisions of the XII. Tables on the subject (infra, p. 690).

The things included in the class of res mancipi were lands and houses held on quiritarian title, together with rights of way and aqueduct, slaves, and domestic beasts of draught or burden (oxen, horses, mules, and donkeys); all others were res nee mancipi. In the time of Servius and during the greater part of the republic the domain land (ager publixus} in Italy, until it was appropriated by private owners, was also reckoned as res nee mancipi ; like all other things of the same class, it passed by simple delivery, whereas res mancipi could not be transferred in full ownership except by mancipation or surrender in court. Many theories have been propounded to account for the distinction between these two classes of things, and to explain the principle of selection that admitted oxen and horses into the one, but relegated sheep and swine, ships and vehicles, to the other. But there is really little difficulty. Under the arrangement of Servius what was to determine the nature and extent of a citizen’s political qualifications, military duties, and financial burdens was the value of his heredium (and other freeholds, if he had any), and what may be called its appurtenances—the slaves that worked for the household, the slaves and beasts of draught and burden that worked the farm, and the servitudes of way and water that ran with the latter. It may be that in course of time slaves without exception were dealt with as res mancipi,— without consideration, that is to say, whether they were employed on their owner’s house or farm or on any part of the public lands in his occupancy—and reasonably, because they were often shifted from the one to the other. But the cattle a man depastured on the public meadows were no more res mancipi than his sheep. To say that the things classed as res mantipi were selected for that distinction by Servius because they were what were essential to a family engaged in agricultural pursuits would be to fall short of the truth. They constituted the familia in the sense of the family estate proper; whereas the herds and flocks, and in time everything else belonging to the paterfamilias, fell under the denomination of peeunia. So the words are to be understood in the well-known phraseology of a testament, familia ρeeuniaque mea.

The public solemnity of mancipatio thus sanctioned as a mode of transferring a quiritarian right of property, for which manus was probably as yet the only technical descriptive word in use, was not long of being adapted to other transactions in which mαηus of a different sort was to be acquired,—for example, coemption, emancipation, adoption of a filiusfamilias, the contract of nexum, release of a nexal debtor, and that mortis causa alienation of his estate by a plebeian which in time developed into the testament per aes et libram.

It has been already explained (p. 674) that, prior to the time of Servius, the matrimonial unions of the plebeians were not, in the estimation of the patricians at least, regarded as lawful marriages (justae nuptiae), although amongst themselves they may have been held effectual and productive, if not of manus, at all events of patria potestas. For this there were two reasons: (1) not being citizens, they did not possess the preliminary qualification for justαx nτιρtiae, namely, conubium ; and (2) not being patricians, the only ceremony of marriage known to the law was incompetent to them. The first obstacle was removed by their admission by Servius to the ordinary rights of citizenship, the second by the introduction of the civil ceremony of coemption. Once the efficacy of mancipation as a mode of acquiring manus over things was established, its adoption by the plebeians, now citizens enjoying conubium, as a method of acquiring manus over their wives was extremely natural. The scales, the libripens, and the five witnesses were all there; but, as there was no real price to be paid, the only copper that was needed was a single raudusculum. The words recited in the ceremonial, unfortunately not preserved, were necessarily different from those in an ordinary mancipation, and, according to the testimony of a considerable number of ancient writers, and as the word eo-emptio itself seems to indicate (though this is disputed by most modern civilians), the nominal purchase was mutual; the man acquired a materfamilias who was to bear him children and enable him to perpetuate his family, while she acquired a paterfamilias who was to maintain her while the marriage lasted, and in whose succession she was to share when a widow. It was accompanied with other observances described by many of the lay writers, but these were matters of usage and fashion rather than of law, and it might be, and often was, accompanied also with religious rites, which, however, were private, not public as in confarreation. It is common, but not quite accurate, to speak of coemption as a form of marriage. It was strictly the acquisition of mawus by the husband over nis wife, and probably in most cases contemporaneous with the marriage; but they were really distinct, the latter being completed simply by interchanged consent. That this was so latterly at least is evident from two facts,—(1) that, according to Gaius, the coemρtio might follow the marriage at any distance of time; and (2) that, according to the same authority, though the marriage was dissolved by divorce, the nιαr∏is still remained until put an end to by remancipation (on which the divorced wife was entitled to insist).

It has also been explained that the plebeians were in a very much worse position than the patricians in regard to their power of disposing of their estates in contemplation of death. Their elevation to the rank of citizens did not apparently give them admission to the comitia of the curies; and, as it was many years after the assassination of Servius before the comitia of the centuries was convened, they had still no means of making testaments unless perhaps in the field on the eve of battle. So here again the expedient of mancipation was taken advantage of, not indeed to make a testament instituting an heir, and to take effect only on the death of the testator,—the form of the transaction, as an instant acquisition in exchange for a price real or nominal, could not lend itself to that without statutory intervention—but to carry the transferrer’s familia ^[19. familia heredium res mancipi, Woe peeunia familia] to a friend, technically familiae emptor, on trust to let the former have the use of it while he survived, ^[20. (Ancient Law, infra,] and on his death to distribute according to his instructions whatever the transferee λvas not authorized to retain for himself. Like so many others of the transactions of the early law, it was legally unprotected so far as the third parties were concerned whom the transferrer meant to benefit; they had no action against the trustee to enforce the trust; their sole guarantee was in his integrity and his respect for Fides.

Dionysius credits Servius with the authorship of more than fifty enactments relative to contracts and crimes, which he says were submitted to and approved by the assembly of the curies. The great majority of those so-called enactments were probably nothing more than formularizations of customary law, for the use of the private judges in civil causes whom the king is said to have instituted. There was one contract, however, notorious in after years under the name of nexmm, that manifestly was influenced, either directly or indirectly, by his legislation. In its normal estate it was a loan of money, or rather of the raw copper that as yet was all that stood for it. Whether before the time of Servius it was accompanied by any formalities beyond the weighing of it in a pair of scales (which was rather substance than form) we know , not; and what right it conferred on the creditor over his debtor who failed to repay can only be matter of speculation. But there are indications that, in the exercise of undefined self-help, defaulters w τ ere treated with considerable severity, being taken in satisfaction and put in chains by their creditors; for Servius is reported to have promised to pay their debts himself in order to obtain their release, and to pass a law limiting execution by persons lending money at interest to the goods of their debtors. Whether he fulfilled the first part of his promise we are not informed; but the second part of it was impracticable, since a debtor’s failure to repay a loan was in most cases attributable to his insolvency and want of means with which to satisfy his creditor. So, apparently, Servius had to be content with regulating and ensuring the publicity of the contract, and making a creditor’s right of self-redress by apprehension (manus injeetio) and confinement of his debtor conditional on the observance of the prescribed formalities of the neχum. These were the weighing of the copper that was being advanced in a pair of scales held by an official libripens ; the reweighing of a single piece in the presence of five citizen witnesses, and its delivery by the lender as representing the wdιole; and the simultaneous recital of certain words of style, which had the effect of imposing on the borrower an obligation to repay the loan, usually with interest, by a certain day. The consequence of this, the earliest independent contract of the fies civile, is explained in p. 693.

Servian Amendments on the Course of Justice.— Of the course of justice in the regal period, whether in criminal or civil matters, poskrernαmque eχpendo (“I weight out to you this the first and the last pound ”). The idea is manifestly archaic, and the words, taken strictly, are quite inappropriate to the transaction in the form it had assumed long before the time of Gaius.
[9:20:678]

before the time of Servius we know little that can be relied on. Antiquity used to speak of the king as having been generally supreme in both. But this can be accepted only with considerable reservation. For the paterfamilias, aided by a council in cases of importance, was judge within the family,—his jurisdiction sometimes excluding that of the state, at other times concurring with it, and not to be stayed even by an acquittal pronounced by it. He alone was competent in any charge against a member of the family for a crime or offence against the domestic order,—adultery or unchastity of wife or daughter, immorality of his sons, unduti-ful behaviour of children or clients; while there are instances on record of his interference judicially where an offence such as murder or theft had been committed by a member of his family against a stranger, and even when his crime had been treason against the state. Death, slavery, banishment, expulsion from the family, imprisonment, chains, stripes, withdrawal of peculkurn, were all at his command as punishments; and it may readily be assumed that in imposing them he was freer to take account of moral guilt than an outside tribunal. The indications of criminal jurisdiction on the part of the gens are slight; but its organization was such that it is impossible not to believe that it must occasionally have been called on to exercise such functions. And it must not be lost sight of that, as murder seems to have been the only crime in regard to which private revenge was absolutely excluded, the judicial office of the kings must have been considerably lightened, public opinion approving and not condemning self-redress so long as it was kept within the limits set by usage and custom.

The boundary between civil and criminal jurisdiction, if it existed at all, was extremely shadowy. Theft and robbery, for example, if one may conclude from the position they held in the later jurisprudence, were regarded not as public but as private wrongs; and yet when a thief was caught plying his trade by night he might be slain, and when taken in the act by day might be sold as a slave. But in both cases it may also be assumed that a practice, afterwards formally sanctioned by the XII. Tables—that of the thief compounding for his life or freedom—was early admitted, and the right of self-redress thus made much more beneficial to the party wronged than when nothing was attained but vengeance on the wrongdoer. In assaults, non-manifest thefts, and other minor wrongs, self-interest would in like manner soon lead to the general adoption of the practice of compounding; what was originally a matter of option in time came to be regarded as a right; and with it there would be occasional difficulty in settling the amount of the composition, and consequent necessity of an appeal to a third party. Here seems to be the origin of the king’s jurisdiction in matters of this sort. He was the natural person to whom to refer such a dispute; for he alone, as supreme magistrate, had the power to use coercion to prevent the party wronged insisting on his right of selfredress, in face of a tender by the wrongdoer of what had been declared to be sufficient reparation. But that self-redress was not stayed if the reparation found due was withheld; as the party wronged was still entitled at a much later period to wreak his vengeance upon the wrongdoer by apprehending and imprisoning him, it cannot reasonably be doubted that such also was the practice of the regal period.

How the kings acquired jurisdiction in questions of quiritarian right, such as disputes about property or inheritance, is by no means so obvious. Within the family, of course, such questions were impossible, though between clansmen they may have been settled by the gens or its chief. The words of style used in the sacramental real action {infra, p. 682) suggest that there must have been a time when the spear was the arbiter, and when the contending parties, backed possibly by their clansmen or friends, were actual combatants, and victory decided the right. Such a procedure could not long survive the institution of a state. In Rome there seems to have been very early substituted for it what from its general complexion one would infer was a submission of the question of right to the pontiffs as the repositories of legal lore. Their proper functions, however, were sacred. So, to bring what was a question of purely civil right within their jurisdiction, they engrafted on it a sacral element, by requiring each of the parties to make oath to the verity of his contention; and the point that in form they decided was which of the two oaths was false and therefore to be made atonement for. In substance, however, it was a finding on the real question at issue; and the party in whose favour it was pronounced was free to make it effectual if necessary by self-redress in the ordinary way.

Of Servius, Dionysius says—using, as he often does, language more appropriate to the republican than to the regal period—that he drew a line of separation between public and private judicial

I)rocesses, and that, while he retained the former in his own hands, ιe referred the latter to private judges, and regulated the procedure to be followed in causes brought before them. Something of the sort was absolutely necessary. He was enormously increasing the number of the citizens,—that is to say, of those who were to enjoy in future the privileges of quiritarian right,—and multiplying the sources of future disputes that would have to be determined by the tribunals. The nature of the provision made by him to meet the new aspect of things is much controverted; but we are disposed to credit him alike with the establishment of the collegiate court of the centumvirs and the institution of the single judge {uηus judex).

The centumviral court and centumviral causes are often referred to by Cicero, and the .ange of their jurisdiction seems to have included every possible question of manus in the old sense of the word,—status of individuals, property and its easements and burdens, inheritance whether testate or intestate,—in other words, all questions of quiritarian right. By the time of Gaius the only matters apparently that were brought before it were questions of right to an inheritance of the j⅛is civile ; but the spear, the emblem of quiritarian right generally, was still its ensign.

That Servius should substitute for king and pontiffs a numerous court of citizens, originally, as there is reason to assume, all patricians, to try questions of quiritarian right on remit from himself, was quite in accordance with the general spirit of his reforms. It was not mere matters of personal dispute they had to decide, but they had to build up by their judgments a law which was to be of general and permanent application; and, as it was beyond the power of the king to overtake the task, what could be a more appropriate substitute than a court of his counsellors acting under pontifical guidance?

But there were many cases requiring judicial assistance in which no question of quiritarian right had to be determined, but only one of personal claim—of alleged indebtedness, whether arising out of a legal or illegal act, denied either in toto or only as to its amount. Matters of that sort were supposed to involve no general principle of law, but to be rather mere disputes or differences about facts, which could well be decided by a single judge. To meet their case the unus jτcdex was introduced; he was appointed for each case as it arose, and acted really as the king’s commissioner. This was the beginning of a system that bore wondrous fruit in after years, and that, as will be shown in the sequel, eventually displaced altogether the more imposing court of the centumvirs.

CHAPTER II.—THE JUS CIVILE.

{From the Establishment of the Republic until the Subjugation of Central and Southern Italy.)

I. Formative Agencies of the Law.

The Legislative Bodies of the Period.— The limits and scope of this article do not permit of any detailed account of the consequences of the change from kings to consuls, or of the tribulations of the plebeians during the first two centuries of the republic. Stage by stage they fought and conquered in the uphill battle for social and political equality. In 260 u.c. they got their own special protectors in their tribunes, with the aediles as their assistants, and judires decemviri to act under their instructions as arbiters in disputes amongst themselves. In 283 they obtained state sanction for their concilium, and recognition of its power to regulate purely plebeian interests. The XII. Tables of 303 were the fruit of their agitation for a revision and written embodiment of the law. It was in deference to their complaints of their practical disfranchisement through the unduly preponderating influence of the patricians in the comitia of the centuries that in 305 the comitia of the tribes was instituted. Their repeated protests against the monopolization of the public domain land by members of the higher order resulted at last in the definite recognition of their right to participate in its occupation by one of the Licinian laws of 387. The long course of cruel oppression of plebeian insolvents by their patrician creditors was put an end to by the Poetilian law of 428 abolishing nexal contract, and prohibiting the use of chains and fetters on persons incarcerated for purely civil debt. By the Hortensian law of 467 the resolutions of the plebeian council {plebiscita) were declared binding not only on the plebeians themselves but on the whole body of the citizens. And from 333, when a plebeian first reached the magistracy through the quaestorship, down to 502, when they attained to the supreme pontificate, they gradually vindicated their right as citizens to share in all the honours and dignities of the state.

The legislative bodies were thus three in number,—the comitia of the centuries, the concilvum plebis, and the [9:20:679]comitia of the tribes. The first, if not organized by Servius Tullius, at all events grew out of his distribution of the populace into classes and centuries according to the value of their freeholds as appearing on the census-list. As just the national army assembled for a peaceful purpose {exerritus civilis), it could be convened and presided over originally only by a magistrate possessing the military imperium, i.e., a consul; but, after the creation of the censorship in 311 and the praetorship in 387, the holders of those offices were entitled to convoke it,—the former for its assent to arrangements for the census, and the latter for state trials. It was the centuries that passed the XII. Tables; but for the most part their legislation was upon questions affecting public and constitutional rather than private interests. The procedure in the centuriate comitia was somewhat cumbrous. There was publication of the proposed law (promulgatio rogationis) a fortnight before the day appointed, sometimes one or more meetings (conciones) being held in the interval for its consideration and discussion. When the day arrived, the auspicia were taken by the presiding magistrate, assisted by an augur; if favourable, the citizens were summoned anew by blast of trumpet, and on their assembling, which originally they did under arms, prayer and sacrifice were offered by president, pontiffs, and augurs. A final concio might then be held if thought necessary; and, after it was over, on the order to “proceed to the comitia,” the citizens marched to the Campus Martius (the formal assembly being incompetent within the city). There the rogatio was read and, if no sign from heaven indicated the dissent of the gods and warned the assembly to disperse, was at once put to the vote—-“Is it your pleasure, Quirites, to hold this as law ?” The vote was taken by centuries, those of the knights and the freeholders of full valuation voting first; if they were unanimous it went no further, for these formed more than a majority of the whole comitia. The resolution, if adopted, was populi jussum, but not yet law. It had still to run the gauntlet of the “fathers,”—whether the senate or only its patrician members is disputed; it was in their power to refuse to authorize it (audores fieri), usually putting their dissent on the ground that the gods willed it not; but if they ratified it, then it became a lex, ordinarily getting the name of the magistrate by whom it had been proposed. The power of veto, however, was considerably qualified by a Publilian law of the year 415, which enacted that in future the “fathers” should grant (or refuse) their auctoritas before the vote was taken.

The points of difference between the enactments of the concilium plebis and the later comitia tributa are indicated by Mommsen in a paper in his Researches. ^[21. Rom. Forschungen, sq.] (1) The comitia was an assembly of the whole body of the people, voting according to tribes instead of centuries; the concilium was an assembly of plebeians only, also voting tributim. (2) The comitia was convened and presided over by a patrician magistrate, not necessarily, however, with military imperium, and therefore very frequently by the praetor; whereas the concilnιm could be convened and presided over only by a plebeian official, either a tribune or an aedile. (3) In the comitia the auspicia had to be taken before the proceedings commenced; in the concilium the will of the gods was not demanded, although listened to if communicated in a thunder-storm or the like. (4) The resolution of the comitia required to be confirmed by the “fathers”; while that of the concilium did not. (5) An enactment of the comitia was a lex, and bound the whole people; but before the Hortensian law an enactment by the concilium plebis was in the ordinary case no more than a plebiscitum, and of force only amongst the plebeians themselves. But there was an exception when, because of some constitutional change proposed by it, the senate had previously sanctioned the legislation, as in the case of the Terentilian law, which paved the way for the XII. Tables, of the Canuleian law authorizing the intermarriage of patricians and plebeians, of the Licinian laws about the occupation of the public lands, &c.; in such cases, although the final vote was that of the concilium, the enactment was binding on the citizens generally, and was spoken of as a lex rather than as a plebiscitum. The latter name seems practically to have been dropped after the Hortensian law had equalized them so far as their effects were concerned. The greater part of the legislation for amending the private law latterly fell to the concilium, owing so far, perhaps, to the greater simplicity of its procedure, but also to some extent to the fact that the praetors preferred making their amendments tentatively by edicts (which were revocable), instead of embodying them in statutes, which, as passed under divine auspices and representing the divine will, could not easily be repealed.

The XII. Tables.— We have already shown the efforts made by Servius Tullius to secure that the dispensation of justice should neither be neglected nor left to caprice or haphazard, one rule to-day and another to-morrow. With the consulate and the disregard of the “royal laws” and of Servius’s instructions to the judges all this was changed. The consuls, with their harassing military engagements, could have little time to devote to their judicial functions or properly to instruct those to whom they delegated the duty of investigating and adjudicating on the merits of a complaint; and the yearly change of magistrates must itself have been a serious obstacle to uniformity either of rule or practice so long as the law rested on nothing but unwritten custom. One can well believe too, when feeling was so embittered between the orders, that it was no rare thing for a consul to use his magisterial punitive powers (coercitio) with undue severity when a plebeian was the object of them, or to turn a deaf ear to an appeal for justice addressed to him from such a quarter. The state of matters had become so intolerable that in the year 292 the demand was made by C. Terentilius Arsa, one of the tribunes, that a commission should be appointed to define in writing the jurisdiction of the magistrates, so that a check might be put on their arbitrary, highhanded, and oppressive administration of what they were pleased to call the law. His colleagues induced him for the moment not to press his demand, which he was urging with a violence of invective that was unlikely to promote his object. But next year they made common cause with him, requiring that the whole law, public and private, should be codified, and its uncertainty thus as far as possible be removed. After a few years’ resistance the senate was induced to give its assent to a demand that in itself was too reasonable to be longer withstood.

The first practical step towards its realization was the despatch of a mission to Greece and the Greek settlements in southern Italy, to study their statute law and collect any materials that might be of service in preparing the projected code. On the return of the ambassadors in 302 all the magistracies were suspended, and a commission of ten patricians (decemviri legibus scribundis) was appointed with consular powers, under the presidency of Appius Claudius, for the express purpose of reducing the laws to writing. Before the end of the ensuing year (303) the bulk of the code was ready, and was at once passed into law by the comitia of the centuries, and engraved or perhaps painted on ten tables of wood, which were exposed in the Forum. Next year the decemvirate was renewed [9:20:680]with a slight change of personnel, but under the same presidency as before; and in the course of a few months it had completed the supplemental matter, which was passed in due form, and displayed on two other tables, thus bringing the number up to twelve and giving the code its official name of Lex XII. Tabulamm.

There were provisions in them that were almost literal renderings from the legislation of Solon; and others bore a remarkable correspondence to laws in observance in Greece, but there is no authority for saying they were directly borrowed. By far the greater proportion of them, however, were native and original,—not that they amounted to a general formularization of the hitherto floating customary law, for, notwithstanding Livy’s eulogium of them as the “fountain of the whole law, both private and public,” it seems clear that many branches of it were dealt with in the Tables only incidentally, or with reference to some point of detail. The institutions of the family, the fundamental rules of succession, the solemnities of such formal acts as mancipation, ηexum, and testaments, the main features of the order of judicial procedure, and so forth,—of all of these a general knowledge was presumed, and the decemvirs thought it unnecessary to define them. What they had to do was to make the law equal for all, to remove every chance of arbitrary dealing by distinct specification of penalties and precise declaration of the circumstances under which rights should be held to have arisen or been lost, and to make such amendments as were necessary to meet the complaints of the plebeians and prevent their oppression in the name of justice. Nothing of the customary law, therefore, or next to nothing, was introduced into the Tables that was already universally recognized, and not complained of as either unequal, indefinite, defective, or oppressive. Only one or two of the laws ascribed to the kings reappeared in them, and that in altered phraseology; yet the omission of the rest did not mean their repeal or imply denial of their validity, for some of them were still in force in the empire, and are founded on by Justinian in his Digest. Neither were any of the laws of the republic anterior to the Tables embodied in them, although for long afterwards many a man had to submit to prosecution under them and to suffer the penalties they imposed. In saying, therefore, that for the most part the provisions of the decemviral code were of native origin, all that is meant is that they were the work of the decemvirs themselves, operating upon the hitherto unwritten law in the directions already indicated.

The original Tables are said to have been destroyed when Rome was sacked and burned by the Gauls. But they were at once reproduced, and transcripts of them must have been abundant if, as Cicero says λvas still the case in his youth, the children were required to commit them to memory as an ordinary school task. This renders all the more extraordinary the fact that the remains of them are so fragmentary and their genuineness in many cases so debatable. They were embodied in the Tripertita of Sextus Aelius Paetus in the year 557; they must have formed the basis of all the writings on the jus civile down to the time of Servius Sulpicius Rufus (who first took the praetor’s edicts as a text); and they were the subjects of monographs by a number of authors of distinction, amongst them by M. Antistius Labeo in the early years of the empire and by Gaius probably in the reign of Hadrian. Yet a couple of score or so are all that can be collected of their provisions in what profess to be the ipsissima verba of the Tables,—though in a form in most cases more modern than what we encounter in other remains of archaic Latin. These are contained principally in the writings of Cicero, the Noctes Attieae of A ulus Gellius, and the treatise De verborum significations of Festus, the last two dealing with them rather as matters of antiquarian curiosity than as rules of positive law. There are many allusions to particular provisions in the pages of Cicero, Varro, Gellius, and the elder Pliny, as well as in those of Gaius, Paul, Ulpian, and other ante-Justinianian jurists; but these are not implicitly to be relied on, as we have evidence that they frequently represent the (sometimes divergent) glosses of the interpreters rather than the actual provisions of the statute. Reconstruction has therefore been a work of difficulty, and the results far from satisfactory, that of the latest editor, Voigt, departing very considerably from the versions generally current during the last half century. ^[22.]

In form the laws contained in the Tables were of remarkable brevity, terseness, and pregnancy, with something of a rhythmical cadence that must have greatly facilitated their retention in the memory. Here and there the rules they embodied were potestative; but for the most part they were peremptory, running on broad lines, surmounting instead of removing difficulties. Their application might cause hardship in individual instances, as when a man was held to the letter of what he had declared in a nexum or mancipation, even though he had done so under error or influenced by fraudulent misrepresentations; the decemvirs admitted no exceptions, preferring a hard-and-fast rule to any qualifications that might cause uncertainty. The system as a whole is one of jus as distinguished from fas. In the royal laws execration {saeratio capitis, sacer esto) was not an uncommon sanction; but in the Tables it occurs only once pure and simple, and that with reference to an offence that could be committed only by a patrician,—material loss caused by a patron to his client (patrmιus, si clienti fraudem, faxsit, sacer esto). In all other cases the idea that a crime was an offence against public order, for which the community was entitled in self-protection to inflict punishment on the criminal, is as prominent as the older one that it was a sin against the gods, to be expiated by dedication of the sinner to the divinity more especially outraged by his offence. Hanging and beheading, flogging to death, burning at the stake, throwing from the Tarpeian rock,— such are the secular penalties that are met with in the Tables; but often, though not invariably, the hanging and so forth is at the same time declared a tribute to some deity to whom the goods of the criminal are forfeited tponseerαtio bononιm).

It is not unworthy of notice that traces remained in the Tables of the old system of self-help. The rnanus injeetio of the third Table—the execution done by a creditor against his debtor—was essentially the same procedure as under the kings, but with the addition of some regulations intended to prevent its abuse. Against a thief taken in the act something of the same sort seems still to have been sanctioned; while it was still lawful to kill him on the spot if the theft was nocturnal, or even when it was committed during the day if he used arms in resisting his apprehension. According to Cicero there was a provision in these words—“si telum manu fugit magis quant jecit, arietem subicito”; this is just a re-enactment in illustrative language of the law attributed to Numa, that for homicide by misadventure—“if the weapon have sped from the hand rather than been aimed”—a ram was to be tendered as a peace-offering to the kinsmen of him who had been slain. The original purpose must have been to stay the blood revenge, and it may even have been so with Numa; but in the Tables it can only have been intended to stay the prosecution which it was incumbent on the kinsmen of a murdered man to institute. So with talionic penalties: “si membrum rupit,ni cum eo pacit, talio esto”—such, according to Gellius, were the words of one of the laws of the Tables, and they undoubtedly contain a reminiscence of a time when talion was recognized, “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”; but in the mouths of the decemvirs they were nothidg more than a clumsy mode of enabling an injured man to exact the greatest money recompense he could, and to have it measured according to the position and fortune of the individual who had done him injury.

The structure of the provisions of the Tables was not such as to enable the plain citizen to apply them to concrete cases, or know how to claim the benefit of them in the tribunals, without some sort of professional advice. Pomponius states that no sooner was the decemviral legislation published than the necessity was felt for its interpretation, and for the preparation by skilled hands of styles of actions by which its provisions might be made effectual. Both of these duties fell to the pontiffs as the oιdy persons who, in the state of civilization of the period, were well qualified to give the assistance required; and Pomponius adds that the college annually appointed one of its members to be the adviser of private parties and of thejwe‰es in those matters. The interprétatif, commenced by the pontiffs and continued by the jurists during the republic, which, Pomponius says, was regarded as part of the civile, was not confined to explanation of the words of the statute, but was in some cases their expansion, in others their limitation, and in many the deduction of new doctrines from the actual jus scrip-turn, and their development and exposition. An event that did much to diminish the influence of the pontiffs in connexion with it was the divulgement in the year 450 by Cn. Flavius, secretary of Appius Claudius Caecus, and probably at his instigation, of a formulary of actions and a calendar of lawful and unlawful days, which got the name of J r ris Flavianum. The practice adopted in the beginning of the 6th century by Tiberius Coruncanius, the

-Processes, der XII. Tafeln, nebst deren Fragmenten, Leipsic, 1883, contain an exposition of the whole of the earlier jus civile, whether embodied in the Tables or not. The history of them occupies the first hundred pages or thereby of the first volume; his reconstruction of fragments and allusions—a good deal fuller than any earlier one, and supported by an imposing array of authorities—is in the same volume, pp. 693-737.
[9:20:681]

first plebeian chief pontiff, of giving advice in law in public had a still greater effect in popularizing it; and the Jus Aelianum, some fifty years later—a collection that included the Tables, the iηter-pretatio, and the current styles of actions—made it as much the heritage of the laity as of the pontifical college.

Subsequent Legislation.— Of legislation during the fourth and fifth centuries that affected the private law we have but scanty record. The best-known enactments are the Canuleian law of 309 repealing the decemviral prohibition of marriages between patricians and plebeians; the Genu-cian, Marcian, and other laws about usury and the rate of interest; the Poetilian law of 428, abolishing the nexal contract; the Silian law, probably not long afterwards, which introduced a new form of process for actions of debt and appears to have given statutory sanction to the stipulation (in its earliest form of sponsio) ; and the Aquilian law of 467, which amended the decemviral provisions about actions of damages for culpable injury to property, and continued to regulate the law on the subject even in the books of Justinian.

II. The Actions of the Law.

The Legis Actiones generally. ^[23.] — We owe to Gaius the only connected (though, owing to the state of the Verona MS., rather fragmentary) account we possess of the legis actiones, as the system of judicial procedure was called which prevailed in Rome down to the substitution of that per formulas by the Aebutian and Julian laws,—the first early in the sixth century of the city, and the second in the age of Augustus. He tells us that as genera agendi or generic forms of process they were five in number, each taking its name from its characteristic feature, viz., (1) sacramento, (2) per judicis postulαtionem (3) per condic-tionem, (4) per manus injectionem, and (5) per pignoris capionem. The third was unknown in the decemviral period, and was introduced by the Silian law alluded to in last paragraph. The other four were all more or less regulated by the XII. Tables, but must in some form have been anterior to them. It is utterly impossible, however, to say of any one of them at what time it was introduced, or what was the statute (Zez) by which it was sanctioned; it may well be that they were not of statutory introduction at all, but were called legis actiones simply because recognized and indirectly confirmed by the Tables. In character and purpose they were very different. The first three were directly employed for determining a question of right or liability, which, if persistently disputed, inevitably resulted in a judicial inquiry. The fourth and fifth might possibly result in judicial intervention; but primarily they were proceedings in execution, in which the party moving in them worked out his own remedy. As regards their comparative antiquity there is much to be said for the opinion of Ihering and Bekker that manus injectio, as essentially nothing more than regulated self-help, must have been the earliest of the five, and that the legis actio Sacramento and the judicis postulatio must have been introduced in aid of it, and to prevent too hasty resort to it where there was room for doubt upon question either of fact or law.

In the three judicial legis actiones the first step was the in jus voeatio or procedure for bringing the respondent into court, minutely regulated by the provisions of the first of the XΠ. Tables. This duty was not committed to any officers of the law; there was no writ of summons of any sort; the party moving in the contemplated litigation had himself to do what was needed. Once before the magistrate (consul or praetor), the plaintiff stated his contention. If admitted unqualifiedly by the defendant, the magistrate at once pronounced his decree, leaving the plaintifi' to work out his remedy as the law prescribed. But, if the case presented was met either with a denial or a qualified defence, and appeared to the magistrate to be one proper for trial, he remitted it for that purpose either to the centumviral tribunal or to one or more private citizens as judges or arbiters. The act of remit was technically litis coentestatio or ordinatio judixvi, the first so named because originally the parties called upon those present to be witnesses to the issue that was being sent for trial. This was the ordinary practice under both the system of the legis actiones and that of the formulae, and prevailed until the time of Diocletian. In the first stage the proceedings were said to be in jure, and the duties of the magistrate in reference to them made up his jurisdictiο; in the second they were said to be in judirio, those presiding in it being styled judixes. All that the judge or judges had to do was to pass judgment on the question remitted to them. They were “right-declarers” only, not “right-enforcers.” If their judgment was for the plaintiff, and he failed to obtain an amicable settlement, he had himself to make it operative by subsequent proceedings by manus injeetio, and that under the eye of the magistrate, not of the judge.

From an enumeration in Cicero of a variety of causes proper to the centumviral court the conclusion seems warranted that it was its peculiar province to decide questions of quiritary right in the strictest acceptation of the word. They were all apparently real actions ipindicationes'),—claims of property in land or of servitudes over it, of right as heir under a testament or in opposition to it, of rights of tutory and succession ab intestalo as agnate or gentile, and so forth. In all these it was a numerous court of Quirites, advised in the early republic by a pontiff, that determined by its vote the question of quiritary right submitted to it. Many such questions in course of time, and possibly at first of express consent of parties, came to be referred to a single judge; but some, and notably claims of inheritance under or in opposition to a testament, were still remitted to the centumviral court in the classical period. Personal actions, however, do not appear ever to have fallen within its cognizance: they were usually sent to a single judge—a private citizen —selected by the parties, but appointed by the magistrate, and to whom the latter administered an oath of office. But, in a few cases in which an action involved not so much a disputed question of right as the exercise of skill and discretion in determining the nature and extent of a right that in the abstract was not denied, the remit was to a plurality of private judges or arbiters, usually three.

The Legis Actio Sacramento. ^[24.] — The characteristic feature of this legis actio, as described by Gaius, was that the parties, after a somewhat dramatic performance before the consul or praetor, each challenged the other to stake a certain sum, the amount of which was fixed by the Tables, and which was to abide the issue of the inquiry by the court or judge to whom the cause was eventually remitted. This stake Gaius refers to indifferently as sacramentum, summa sacramenti, and poena sacramenti. The formal question the court had to determine was,—whose stake had been justified, whose not (cujus sacramentum justum, cujus injustum) ; the first was returned to the staker, the second forfeited originally to sacred and afterwards to public uses. But the decision on this formal question necessarily involved a judgment on the matter actually in dispute, and, if it was for the plaintiff, entitled him, failing an amicable arrangement, to take ulterior steps for making it effectual. The procedure was still employed in the time of Gaius in the few cases [9:20:682]that continued to be referred to the centumviral court, but otherwise it had been long in disuse.

Gaius explains that it was resorted to both in real and personal actions. Unfortunately the MS. of his Institutes is defective in the passage in which he described its application to the latter. We possess the greater part of his account of the actio in rem as employed to raise and determine a question of ownership; but his illustration is of vindication of a slave, and not so interesting or instructive as the proceedings for vindication of land. These, however, can be reconstructed with tolerable certainty with the aid derived from Cicero, Varro, and Gellius.

The parties appeared before the magistrate, each armed with a rod (fiestuca) representing his spear {quir or hαsta), the symbol, as Gaius says, of quiritarian ownership. The first word was spoken by the raiser of the action, and addressed to his opponent: “I say that the land in question [describing it sufficiently for identification] is mine in quiritary right {meumesse ex jure quiritium); wherefore I require you to go there and join issue with me in presence of the magistrate {injure maηum eonserere}C Thereupon, according to the earliest practice, the magistrate and the parties, accompanied by their friends and backers, proceeded to the ground for the purpose: the court was transferred from the forum to the land itself. As distances increased, however, and the engagements of the consuls multiplied, this became inconvenient. Instead of it, this course was adopted: the parties went to the spot without the magistrate, but on his command, and there joined issue in the presence of their seconds, who had been ordered to accompany them, and who probably made a report of the due observance of formalities on their return. Still later the procedure was further simplified by having a turf brought from the place beforehand— probably as time advanced there would be no very particular inquiry as to where it had been obtained—and deposited a few yards from the magistrate’s chair; and, when he ordered the parties to go to the ground and join issue, they merely brought forward the turf and set it before him, and proceeded to make their formal vindications upon it, as representing the whole land in dispute.

The ritual was as follows. The raiser of the action, addressing his adversary, again affirmed his ownership, but this time with the significant addition—“As I have asserted my right by word of mouth, look you, so do I now with my viηdicta"∙, and therewith he touched the turf with his rod, which was called vindieta when employed for this purpose. The magistrate then asked the other party whether he meant to counter-vindicate. If he replied in the negative or made no response, there was instant decree {addictw) in favour of the first party, and the proceedings were at an end. If, however, he counter-vindicated, it was by repeating the same words and re-enacting the same play as his adversary :—“I say that the land is mine in quiritary right, and I too lay my vindieta upon it” The verbal and symbolical vindication and counter-vindication completed what was technically the manus consertio. The parties were now in this position: each had asserted his ownership, and had figuratively had recourse to arms in maintenance of his contention. But the matter was to be settled judicially, so the magistrate once more intervened and ordered both to withdraw from the land. The dialogue was then resumed, the vindicant demanding to know from his opponent upon what pretence {eausa) he had counter-vindicated. In the illustration in Gaius he avoided the question and pleaded the general issue, —“I have done as is my right in laying my vindieta on the land.” But there can be little doubt that in certain circumstances the counter-vindicant would deem it expedient to disclose his title. This was very necessary where he attributed his right to a conveyance upon which two years’ possession had not yet followed; in such a case he had to name his author {auctοrem laudare) if he desired to preserve recourse against the latter on the warranty implied in the mancipation. That probably entailed a suspension of the proceedings to allow of the author’s citation for his interest; and on their resumption, if he appeared and admitted his auctοritae, he was formally made a party to the action.

The proceedings had now reached the sacramental stage proper. The first challenge came from the vindicant,—“Since you have vindicated unrightfully, I challenge you with a sacrament of 500 assesto which the counter-vindicant responded,—“And I you.” This was technically the Sacramento provocatio. The magistrate thereupon remitted the matter for trial to the centumviral court, or possibly, in certain cases, to a single judge, and in the presence of witnesses called by the parties {litie cοntestαtiο) declared what exactly was the question put in issue which the court or judge was to decide. At the same time, according to Gaius’s account of the procedure, he required sureties from the parties for the eventual payment by him who was unsuccessful of the sacrament he had offered to stake, and which became a forfeit to the exchequer. (The original practice was for the stake to be deposited by both parties in the hands of the pontiffs before they were heard by the cen-tumviral court; after judgment that of the gainer was reclaimed by him, while that of the loser was retained for religious uses.) The magistrate also made arrangements for the interim possession of the land by one or other of the litigants, taking security from him that, if he was eventually unsuccessful, it should be returned to his opponent, along with all the fruits and profits drawn in the interval. At the trial, as both parties were vindicants, there must have been a certain burden of proof upon both sides. The vindicant, one may believe, must have been required to establish in the first instance that the thing he claimed had at some time been his; and then, but probably not till then, the counter-vindicant would have to prove a later title in his person sufficient to exclude that of his opponent. The judgment, as already observed, necessarily involved a finding on the main question; but in form it was a declaration as to the sacrament: that of the party who prevailed was declared to be just, and that of his unsuccessful opponent unjust.

Looking at this ritual as a whole the conviction is irresistible that it could not have been so devised by one brain. It reveals and combines three distinct stages in the history of procedure,— appeal to arms and self-help, appeal to the gods and the spiritual power, appeal to the civil magistrate and his judicial office. As Gellius says, the real and substantial fight for might, that in olden days had been maintained at the point of the spear, had given place to a civil and festucarian combat in which words were the weapons, and which was to be settled by the interposition of the praetor. But this does not explain the sacrarneηtum. Very various theories have been proposed to account for it. According to Gaius, it was nothing more than the sum of money staked by each of the parties, which was forfeited originally to sacred and afterwards to public uses by him who was unsuccessful, as a penalty for his rashly running into litigation; and substantially the same explanation is given by Festus in one of his definitions of the word. But this is far from satisfactory; for it involves the absurdity of declaring that a penalty imposed by law could be unjust {iηjustιιm) in any case, and the still greater absurdity of declaring it just in the case of the party who was in the right, and unjust in the case of him who was in the wrong. There is another definition in Festus—“a thing is said to be done Sacramento when the sanction of an oath is interposed ”—which lends support to the opinion that there was a time when parties to a question of right were required to take an oath to the verity of their respective assertions; that they were also required concurrently to deposit five bullocks or five sheep, according to the nature or value of the thing in dispute, to abide the issue of the inquiry; ^[25.] that the question for determination was whose oath was just and whose unjust; and that he who was found to have sworn unjustly forfeited his cattle or sheep as a piamentum—a peace-offering to the outraged deity— while the other party reclaimed his from the repository in which they had been detained in the interval. ^[26.]
[9:20:683]

The writers who adopt this view are far from being unanimous as to details. But there seems to be enough to render it more than probable that, at an intermediate stage between the vera solida vis of ancient times and the vis civilis et festucaria which Gellius and Gaius depict, there was a procedure by appeal to the gods through means of oaths of verity sworn by the parties, in the manner and with the consequences that have been indicated. That in time it should have dropped out of the ritual is quite in the order of things. Its tendency was to become a mere form, imposing no real restraint on reckless litigation. The restraint was rather in the dread of forfeiture of the sacramental cattle, sheep, or money that would follow a verdict that an oath had been unjust. And it must have been felt besides that it was unfair to brand a man as a false-swearer, needing to expiate his offence by an offering to the gods, whose oath had been perfectly honest. That he should suffer a penalty for his imprudence in not having taken more care to ascertain his position, and for thus causing needless annoyance to others, was reasonable, but did not justify his being dealt with as one who had knowingly outraged the deity to whom he had appealed. So the oath — the original sacramentum—disappeared, the name passing by a natural enough process to the money which had been wont to be deposited before the oath was sworn, but which now ceased to be an offering in expiation by a false-swearer, and became a mere penalty of rash litigation (poena temere litigantis).

It may be assumed that in most cases the finding of the cen-tumvirs as to the justness or unjustness of the respective sacraments of the parties was the end of the case,—that it was at once accepted and loyally given effect to. Festus, however, preserves a law of the XII. Tables which, according to Mommsen’s rendering, declared that, when it turned out that interim possession had been awarded to the wrong party, it was to be in the latter’s power to demand the appointment of three arbiters who should ascertain the value of the object of vindication and its fruits, and assess the damages due for non-restitution at double the amount. This provision seems to have been intended to afford the wrongful interim possessor, who was not in a position to make specific restitution to his successful opponent, a means of avoiding the apprehension and imprisonment which were the statutory consequences of failure to implement a judgment. It is probable that in time this duplicated money payment came to be regarded as the satisfaction to which the successful party in a vindication was entitled in every case in which, no matter for what reason, he was unable to obtain the thing itself and its fruits from their interim possessor; that consequently an arbitrium litis aestimandae, or reference to arbiters to assess their value, resulted in every such case; and that it was to assure its payment that the praetor required the party to whom the interim possession was awarded to give to his opponent the sureties (precedes litis et vindiciarum) to whom Gaius alludes.

After this explanation of the procedure in the sacramental action for vindication of land it is unnecessary to enter into any detail of what was done when it was a movable that was being vindicated, or when the action was a personal one for payment of money. The real action about a movable was of course simpler than that described; for the thing was always in prαesentia. As regards personal actions, the ordinarily received opinion, which rests, however, on slender foundations, is that from the first the parties met on equal terms; that, if it was a case of money debt, the creditor commenced the proceedings with the averment that the defendant owed him the sum in question,—“I say that you ought to pay me (dare oportere) 1000 asses”; that this was met with a denial; and that a sacramental challenge followed on either side. All are agreed that the remit was to a single judex after an interval of thirty days from the proceedings in jure; that where the claim was for a definite sum the plaintiff had to establish his case to the letter; and that his sacrament was necessarily declared unjust if he failed to prove his claim by a single penny. But there is considerable diversity of opinion as to whether by this form of process a claim of uncertain amount could be insisted on,—as, for example, for damages for breach of a warranty of acreage of lands sold, or of their freedom from burdens. If it could, then probably the question raised and dealt with Sacramento was the abstract one of liability,—Was the warranty given, and has it failed? the sum due in respect of the breach being left to be dealt with in a subsequent arbitral process (arbitrium litis aestimandae').

The Legis Actio per Judicis Postulationem. ^[27.] — The defects of the Verona MS. have deprived us of Gaius’s account of this legis actio. There is little elsewhere that can with any certainty be said to bear upon it. The most important is a note in Valerius Probus— T.PRH.A. V.P. V.D., which is generally interpreted— te, praetor, judicem arbi-trumve postulo uti des. This petition to the magistrate —king, consul, praetor—to appoint a judge, arbiter, or arbiters (as the case might be) in all probability was part of the procedure in the action, and that from which it derived its distinctive name. Beyond this all is conjecture, alike as to the nature and form of the action and the cases to which it was applicable. Gaius says of the legis actio Sacramento that it was general, and that it was the procedure that was to be resorted to where no other was prescribed by statute. The extant fragments of the XII. Tables contain no such indications as this would lead us to expect; there is not a hint in them of an express instruction that proceedings in any particular case were to be per judicis postulationem.

While it is impossible with certainty to trace the history of this procedure to its first beginnings, yet the impression is general that it must have originated in the regal period. There were three different positions in which an appeal for aid might be made to a court of justice,—(1) when it was a question of civil right that had to be decided in terms directly affirmative or directly negative of the contention of the raiser of the action, and one in which questions of both law and fact were involved; (2) when it was only a question of fact that had to be ascertained,—the legal result of the fact, if established, being known beforehand; (3) when facts had to be set against facts, and a result arrived at that in the judgment of those who had to balance them was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. In the first case, as when the contention was meum esse or dari oportere (otherwise than under an obligationary nexum), the procedure was sαcramento and the reference originally (in all probability) to the pontiffs, although afterwards to the centumviral court or to a judex; in the second, as when the question was—had or had not the defendant assaulted the plaintiff, and so incurred the invariable statutory penalty, the reference was probably to a judex without the intervention of a sacrament; in the third, as when the matter in hand was the partitioning of an inheritance amongst co-heirs, or the determining whether operations of the defendant were interfering with the natural drainage of the plaintiff’s land and how the mischief was to be abated, or the assessment of damages for injury to property, or of the sum sufficient to relieve from talion or the statutory penalty of theft, the reference was to an arbiter or arbiters. In the procedure Sacramento the pleadings opened directly with an averment of right—“I say that this is mine,” “I say that the defendant is bound to pay me so much”; but in that per judicis arbitrive postulatio there is reason to surmise that they commenced with an averment of fact, followed by the resulting demand of the plaintiff. The details, however, are quite uncertain, with the exception that in some arbitria the plaintiff expressly threw himself upon the discretion of the arbiters—quantum aeqius melius est ob cam rem mihi dari.

The Legis Actio per Condictioηem.— This the youngest “action of the law” was introduced, Gaius says, by the Silian law as a means of recovering a liquid money debt lperta pecunia), and afterwards made available by the Cal-purnian law for enforcing personal claims (as distinguished from real rights) for anything else definite and certain (pmηis res certa), and in both its forms, therefore, essentially an action of debt. The date of both enactments is matter of controversy, although there is no question that the Silian was the earlier. Gaius says of it that its purpose was far from obvious, as there was no difficulty in recovering money either by a sacramental action or one per judicis postulationem. He overlooks the fact that money due under a πexal contract was recoverable by neither of these processes, but by the much more summary one of manus injectio. By the Poetilian law of 428 this was declared unlawful. We are disposed to regard the Lex Silia and the new procedure it authorized as a result of the change. To have put off a creditor for money lent either with a sacramental action or one per judicis postulationem would have been to deprive him of the advantages of manus injectio to a greater extent than was called for. So it was provided by the Silian law that, when a man disputed his liability for what was called pecunia certa crédita, and forced his creditor to litigation, not only was the defendant bound in the first place either to deny his [9:20:684]liability under oath or else to pay the sum claimed; but if he did deny it the plaintiff was entitled to require from him an engagement to pay one-third more by way of penalty in the event of judgment being against him, while the sσi-disant creditor had to give an engagement to pay as penalty the same amount in case of judgment in favour of the alleged debtor. These engagements (sponsio et resti-ρulatiο tertiae partis) were not allowed in every case in which a definite sum of money was claimed per condic-tioηem, but only when it was technically pecunia crédita. In Cicero’s time creditum might arise either from loan, stipulation, or literal contract (expensilatio) ; but the last dated at soonest from the beginning of the 6th century, and stipulation apparently was a result of the Silian law itself, so that the pecunia crédita of this enactment can have referred only to borrowed money. The same phrase, according to Livy, was employed in the Poetilian law; it was thereby enacted, he says, that for pecunia crédita the goods, not the body of the debtor, ought to be taken in execution. A connexion, therefore, between the Poetilian law and the abolition of the nexum on the one hand, and the Silian law and the introduction of the legis actio per condictionem on the other, can hardly be ignored, and raises more than a probability that the latter statute was a consequence of the former, and must have been passed immediately or soon after the year 428. In the action for a money debt that was not technically pecunia crédita, and in the action on the Calpurnian law, it is probable that the defendant could be required to negative the claim under oath (jusjurandum in jure delatuιn) on pain of being held as confessed; but there was no penalty of a third part on either side.

Little is known of the procedure ^[28.] in this legis actio, for, in consequence of the loss of a leaf in the Verona MS., we are without part of Gaius’s account of it. It got its distinctive name, he says, from the condictio or requisition made by the plaintiff on the defendant, whom he had brought into court in the usual way, to attend again on the expiry of thirty days to have a judge appointed. It was probably only on the reappearance of the parties, and after the defendant had had time for looking into the facts, that the latter could be required to make oath as to his defence of non-indebtedness. In the action for pecunia credita it would be then also, and after the oath, if demanded, had been given, that the sponsw et restipulatio tertiae partis were exchanged; and it is probable that, if either party refused on the praetor’s command so to oblige himself towards the other, judgment was at once pronounced in favour of the latter without any remit to a judex. How the issue was adjusted when the sponsion and restipulation were duly given we are not informed; but, judging by analogy from the procedure in an action for breach of interdict under the formulai· system, and on the broader ground that there must have been machinery for a condemnation of the plaintiff on his restipulation in the event of his being found in the wrong, it may reasonably be concluded that there were in fact three concurrent issues sent to the same judex,—the first on the main question, the second on the defendant’s sponsion, and the third on the plaintiff’s restipulation. When a sum of money other than pecunia credita or a thing or quantity of things other than money was sued for, those subsidiary issues were unnecessary, as there was neither sponsion nor restipulation.

As Baron has demonstrated, it was not the usual practice to introduce any words explanatory of the ground of indebtedness when the action was either for money (other than pecunia crédita} or for a thing or quantity of things. It might be loan, or bequest, or sale, or purchase, or delict, or unjustifiable enrichment, or any of a hundred causae; it would have to be condescended on of course before the judge; but in the initial stage before the praetor and in the issue all that was necessary was the averment that the defendant was owing such a sum of money or such a thing. It was for the judge to determine whether or not the averment was established and, in certain cases, that non-delivery was due to the fault of the defendant; the plaintiff, however, was bound to make his averment good to the letter of his claim. In the event of the plaintiff being successful in an action for certapecunia, but delay was made by the defendant in satisfying the judgment, execution followed in ordinary form. How the matter was arranged in an action on the Calpurnian law for a certa res is not so obvious. What the plaintiff wanted was specific delivery or damages, and by some the opinion is entertained that he formulated his claim alternatively. Of this there is no evidence; and Gaius’s statement that under the system of the legis actiones condemnation was always in the ipsa res, ix., the specific thing sued for, leads to the assumption that a judgment for the plaintiff, on which specific implement failed, must have been followed by an arbitrium litis acstimarulae for assessment of the damages in money, and that execution proceeded thereon as if the judgment had been for a sum of money in the first instance. The general opinion, however, is that the judge to whom the issue was remitted assessed the damages himself and as a matter of course,—that the instruction to him was pιαnti res erit, tantam ρecuniam condemnαto.

The Legis Actio per Manns Injectionem. ^[29. ,] — This “action of the law” was ordinarily employed as a means of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor or one who had confessed liability in the first stage of a process. But, in certain cases in which it was thought proper that a creditor should have a more summary remedy than was afforded by a sacramental action or one per judicis postulationem, he was allowed to apprehend his debtor without any antecedent judgment; and, if the debtor disputed liability, the question could be tried only in proceedings at his instance, or sometimes at that of a third party on his behalf, for a stay of execution. It will simplify matters, however, to confine our attention to it in the meantime as a means of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor.

Gaius’s description of it is very general; for details we are indebted principally to the Noctes Attiras of Aulus Gellius, in an account which he gives (put into the mouth of Sext. Caecilius Africanus, a well-known jurist of about the same time as Gaius, and a contemporary of his own) of the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference to it. Africanus is made to say that according to his belief (opinor) the words of the statute were these :—“For admitted money debts and in causes that have been regularly determined by judgment (aeris confessi rebusque jure judicatis) there shall be thirty days’ grace. After that there may be mamus iηjectio. The apprehending creditor shall then bring his debtor before the magistrate. If he still fail to satisfy the judgment, and no vindex come forward to relieve him, his creditor may carry him home and put him in chains. He may live at his own cost; if not, his creditor must give him daily a pound of spelt, or more if he please.” Africanus continues narrative: “There was still room for the parties to come to terms; but, if they did not, the debtor was kept in chains for sixty days. Towards the end of that time he was brought before the praetor in the comitium on three consecutive market-days, and the amount of the judgment-debt proclaimed. After the third capite poenas dabat,”— what these words mean will be considered in the sequel,—“or else he was sent across the Tiber to be sold to a foreigner. And this capital penalty, sanctioned in the hope of deterring men from unfaithfulness to their engagements, was one to be dreaded because of its atrocity and of the new terrors with which the decemvirs thought proper to invest it. For, if it was to more creditors than one that the debtor had been adjudged, they might, if they pleased, cut up and divide his body. Here are the words [9:20:685]of the statute,—‘Tertiis nundinis partis secanto. Si plus minusve secuerunt, se fraude esto.’”

Such is Gellius’s account of the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference to this legis actio. But it is to be borne in mind that he does not vouch for its accuracy; the Tables were already in his time matter of antiquity, and even the jurists knew nothing of them beyond what was still in observance. That he has reproduced them only partially seems almost beyond question; for in another chapter he himself quotes a couple of sentences that are to all appearance from the same context. We have to face, therefore, the extreme probability that the record is incomplete and the possibility besides that it is not literally accurate. There is room for error, consequently, in two directions; but the nature and effect of the procedure in its main features may be gathered from the texts as they stand with reasonable certainty.

It was competent only after thirty days from the date of judgment or confession. It was apprehension of the debtor by the creditor himself,—in its first stage, at least, an act of pure self-help. The debtor had at once to be brought before the magistrate, in order that his creditor might obtain authority to carry him away and provisionally confine him in the domestic lock-up. Such a course, however, was avoided either (1) by instant payment or other implement of the judgment, or (2) by the intervention of a vindex or champion. The position taken by the latter was not exactly that either of a surety or of an attorney for the judieatus demanding a rehearing of the case: he appeared rather as a con-troverter in his own name of the right of the creditor to proceed further with his execution, on the ground that the judgment was invalid. This necessitated an action between the υiηdex and the creditor, in which the former was plaintiff, but to which the debtor was not a party. If it failed, then the vindex was liable for double the amount of the original debt, as a penalty on him for having improperly interfered with the course of justice; but on payment he had relief against the original debtor who had been liberated through his intervention. Failing a vindex and failing payment, the creditor took his debtor home and incarcerated him, dealing with him for sixty days in the manner above described. On their expiry, without any arrangement, there was a magisterial decree {αeldictio') awarding the debtor to his creditor.

What right did this addietio confer upon the creditor? The debtor, says Gellius, “capite poenas dabat,” which he interprets as meaning that his creditor might put him to death, the alternative being his sale as a slave beyond the Roman frontier. According to this view a man sentenced to twenty-five asses for a petty assault, which he could not pay, might have to suffer death instead. Manifest theft was considered a greater offence, or at least to merit a heavier punishment, than non-manifest,—slavery for the former, a pecuniary penalty for the latter; but, if it had been the case that every judieatus who failed within three months to satisfy his creditor might be put to death, then the non-manifest thief against whom a judgment had been obtained must often in the end have suffered a penalty more serious than that which overtook him whose theft had been manifest,—slavery for the graver offence, death for the lighter. Capite poenas dabat, therefore, cannot have meant death. But it is just as impossible that it can have meant slavery. And there is abundant evidence that the addirdus, even after the completion of his two months of provisional detention, was still de jure free,—that he was not capite minutus even as regarded citizenship or family rights, and that any property he had still remained his own. The only other explanation is that “he paid the penalty with his person,” in contradistinction to “his means.” Caρτd is used in opposition to bona. Under the law of the Tables, when the manus injectio was at the instance of one creditor only, the extent of the latter’s right was to detain his debtor in free bondage, making what use he could of his services, and exercising discipline over him as if he were a slave. But for the mistaken notion that a creditor was entitled after the expiry of the three months to put his debtor to death—of which there is not a single instance on record—it is unlikely that any one would have thought of imputing to the partis secanto such an inhuman meaning as that a plurality of creditors might cut the body of their addictτcs in pieces and each take a share.

The opinion is entertained by many jurists that the partis secanto of the Tables referred not to the body but to the belongings of the debtor,—that when there were concurrent creditors they shared his familia amongst them. There are two difficulties to face,—(1) that, once a debtor was in the hands of a creditor, even provisionally, rnanus injectio by a second creditor was impossible; and (2) that the debtor’s estate did not fall within the power of the incarcerating creditor. The first is removed by a suggestion of Voigt’s, that the plurality of creditors Gellius speaks of may have referred to tlιe case of co-heirs taking proceedings against a debtor of their ancestor’s. The second disappears on a slight rearrangement of the words of the Tables as Gellius records them. ^[30.] The result to which it brings us is this: where there was but one creditor concerned, and the two months of provisional detention expired without payment, or intervention of a vindex, or compromise of some sort, the debtor definitively became his creditor’s free bondman in virtue of the magisterial αMictiο; but, where co-heirs were concerned, as bondage and service to all of them would have been inconvenient if not impossible when they were not to continue to possess the inheritance in common, the debtor was sent across the Tiber and sold as a slave, and the price got for him divided among them. If one or other got more than his fair share, no harm was done; for the disproportion could eventually be redressed in an action of partition {actio familiae erciscundae').

The disgraceful cruelties and indignities to which creditors subjected both their judgment and nexal debtors led to many a commotion in the first two centuries of the republic. The latter were probably much more numerous than the judicati, and, being in great part the victims of innocent misfortune, it was the sufferings they endured at the hands of relentless creditors that so often roused the sympathies and indignation of the populace. But the judgment-debtors had suffered along with them; and some of the provisions of the Poetilian law of 428 were meant to protect them against the needless and unjustifiable severity that had characterized their treatment. The manus injectio itself was not abolished, nor the possible intervention of a vindex ; neither were the domum ductio that followed, and the provisional imprisonment with the light chains, authorized by the Tables while it lasted; nor was the formal addietio of the debtor to his creditor when the sixty days had expired without arrangement. But after addiction, if it was for nothing more than civil debt, there were to be no more dungeons and stripes, fetters and foot-blocks; the creditor was to treat his debtor and his industry as a source of profit that would in time diminish and possibly extinguish his indebtedness, rather than as an object upon which he might perpetrate any cruelty by way of punishment. Although the edict of P. Rutilius of 647 u.c. provided a creditor with machinery for attacking the estate of his debtor, he had still the alternative of incarceration. This might be avoided under the Julian law of cessio by the debtor’s making a complete surrender of his goods to his creditor; but, failing such surrender, incarceration continued to be resorted to even under the legislation of Justinian. Latterly, however, it was not by rnanus injectio that the incarceration was effected; for it went out of use with the definitive establishment of the formular system of procedure.

It was as directed against judgment and nexal debtors (see infra, p. 693) that manus injectio was of most importance and chiefly made its mark in history. But there were other cases in which it was resorted to under special statutory authority, where a remedy seemed advisable more sharp and summary than that by ordinary action. In some of these it was spoken of as manus injectio pro judicato {i.e., as if upon a judgment), in others as simple manus injectio {manus injectio pwra). In the first the arrestee was not allowed to dispute his alleged indebtedness in person; he could do so only through a vindex; and if no one intervened for him in that character he was carried off and dealt with by his arresting creditor as if a judgment had been obtained against him. In the second he was not required to find a vindex, but might himself dispute the verity of the charge made against him, under penalty, however, of a duplication of his liability if he failed in his contention. By a Lex Vallia, probably in the latter half of the 6th century of the city, this manus injectio para was substituted for that pro judicato in all cases in which the ground of arrest was neither judgment nor depensum, i.e., payment by a surety or other party on account of the true debtor, who failed to relieve the former within six months thereafter.

The Legis Actio per Pignoris Capionem. ^[31.] — In the ritual this: “Tertiis nundinis addicitor. Capite poenas dato. Si plures sunt, trans Tiherim peregre venum danto, partis secanto. Si plus minusve secuerunt, se fraude esto ”—“On the third market-day there shall be decree of addiction. The addictus shall then pay the penalty with his person. If there be several creditors to whom he is awarded, let them sell him beyond Tiber and divide the price. If any of them have got more or less than his fair share, no harm shall result.”
[9:20:686]

of the actio sacramenti the ms civilis et festucaria was a reminiscence of the vera solida vis with which men settled their disputes about property in the earliest infancy of the commonwealth. Manus ιnjectio was a survival from times when the wronged was held entitled to lay hands upon the λvrongdoer, and himself subject him to punishment; custom and legislation intervened merely to regulate the conditions and mode of exercise of what essentially was still self-help. In pignons capio self-help was likewise the dominant idea. It may be fairly enough described by the single word distress,—the taking by one man of property belonging to another in satisfaction of or in security for a debt due by the latter which he had failed to pay. The taking did not proceed upon any judgment, nor did it require the warrant of a magistrate; it might be resorted to even in the absence of the debtor; but it required to be accompanied by certain words of style, spoken probably in the presence of witnesses. It was only in a few exceptional cases that it was competent, in some by force of custom, in others by statute. What was the procedure, and what its effects, are far from certain. Ihering, founding on some expressions of Cicero’s, conjectures that, whether the debt was disputed or not, the distrainer could neither sell nor definitely appropriate his pignus without magisterial authority,—that in every case he was bound to institute proceedings in justification of his caption, and to take in them the position of plaintiff. The idea is ingenious, and puts the joignons capio in a new and interesting light. It makes it a summary means of raising a question of right for whose judicial arbitrament no other process of law was open,—with the additional advantage that it secured instant satisfaction to the raiser of it in the event of the question being determined in his favour. If against him, the inevitable result, in substance at least, must have been a judgment that he had no right to retain his pledge, with probably a finding that he was further liable to its owner in the value of it, as a punishment for his precipitancy. ^[32.]

Judicial or Quasi-Judicial Procedure outside the Legis Actirnes. —Whatever may have been the extent of the field covered by the actions of the law, they did not altogether exclude other judicial or quasi-judicial agencies. The supreme magistrate every now and then was called upon to intervene in matters brought under his cognizance by petition or complaint, in which his aid was sought not so much to protect a vested right of property or claim as to maintain public order, or to prevent the occurrence or continuance of a state of matters that might prove prejudicial to family or individual interests. The process was not an action, with its stages in jure and in judiciο, but an inquiry conducted from first to last by the magistrate himself; and his finding, unless it was a dismissal of the complaint or petition, was embodied in an order {dccretum, unterdictum) which it was for him to enforce by such means as he thought fit,—manu militari or by fine or imprisonment. Some jurists are disposed to give a very wide range to this magisterial intervention. One of its most important manifestations was in connexion with disputes about the occupancy of the public domain lands. These did not belong in property to the occupants, so that an action founded on ownership was out of the question. But, as the occupancy was not only recognized but sanctioned by the state, it was right, indeed necessary in the interest of public order, that it should be protected against disturbance. In the measures resorted to for its protection Niebuhr recognized the origin of the famous possessory interdict uti possidetis', and, although opinions differ as to whether protection of the better right or prevention of a breach of the peace was what primarily influenced the magistrate’s intervention, there is a pretty general accord in accepting this view. Another illustration of this magisterial intervention is to be found in the interdiction of a spendthrift,—a decree depriving of his power of administration a man who was squandering his family estate and reducing his children to penury; a third presents itself in the removal of a tutor from office on the ground of negligence or maladmmistration, brought under the notice of the magistrate by any third party in what was called postulatio suspeeti tutoris; and a fourth in the putting of a creditor in possession of the goods of an insolvent debtor, which must have been common enough even before the general bankruptcy regulations of the Rutilian edict. These are to be taken merely as examples of this magisterial intervention, which manifested itself in very various directions; and it is easy to see how largely such procedure might be utilized for remedying the grievances of persons who, from defect of complete legal title, want of statutory authority, or otherwise, were not in a position to avail themselves of the “actions of the law.”

In one of the Valerio-Horatian laws consequent on the second secession of the plebeians there was mention of ten judges {judices decemviri'), whose persons were declared as inviolable as those of the tribunes of the people and the plebeian aediles. These were a body of judges elected to officiate on remit from a tribune or aedile in questions arising between members of the plebeian body. We are without details as to the institution of this plebeian judicatory, the questions that fell under its cognizance, the forms of process employed, the law administered by it, and the effect of its judgments. It is not much referred to by the historians; and its decadence has been attributed to the fact that the Lex Hortensia of 468 made the nundinae lawful court days {dies fasti), and so made it possible for the country folks coming to the city to market to carry on then· processes before the praetor.

As all in a manner exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions must also be mentioned the pontiffs, the consuls, and afterwards the censors as magistri morum, the chiefs of the gentes within the gentile corporations, and heads of families within their households. While it may be the fact that with the enactment of the XII. Tables the jurisdiction of the pontiffs ^[33.] was materially narrowed, it certainly did not disappear,—witness the famous case in which Cicero made before them the oration of which he was so proud, Pro domo sua. The action of the consuls and afterwards of the censors as guardians of public morals, and the social and political disqualifications and pecuniary penalties with which they visited persons who had been guilty of perjury or gross perfidy, did not a little to foster fidelity to engagements. Through the same agency the exercise of a variety of rights whose abuse could not be made matter of action—the husband’s power over his wife, the father’s over his children—was controlled and kept within bounds. It was not on light grounds, indeed, that the majesty of the paterfamilias within the household could be called in question; it was only when he forgot that in the exercise of serious discipline within his family he was bound to act judicially. For he also was a judge —judex domesticus, as he is often called, though in all cases of gravity he was required to invoke the advice of his kinsfolk in a family council. On him lay the duty of controlling his family; if he failed to do so he was himself in danger of censorial animadversion. That his gens also, if he were a patrician, had some supervision and power of calling him to account is extremely probable; every corporation had it more or less over its members; but neither historians nor jurists give us any definite information.

Between citizens and foreigners with whom Rome was in alliance by a treaty conferring reciprocal right of action the proceedings took the form known as recuperatio. ^[34.] It was an international process, modelled to some extent upon, and deriving some of its technical terms from, the fetial elarigatio. The action was always raised in the forum contractus. The magistrate ordinarily presiding there heard what parties had to say in plaint and defence, and then put in simple shape the points of fact arising on them, authorizing the recuperators to whom the matter was remitted to find for plaintiff or defendant according to circumstances. The recuperators were sometimes three, sometimes five, sometimes still more numerous, but always in odd number; whether the nationality of both parties required to be represented we are not told. Expedition being in most cases a matter of importance, recuperators were required to give judgment within ten days. How execution proceeded upon it, if it were for the plaintiff, does not clearly appear; nica, Berlin, 1861, p. 95 sq.; Ihering, Geist d. rom. Rechts, vol. i. § 11c; Voigt, XII. Tafeln, vol. i. p. 502 sq.

Le droit pontifical chez les anciens Romains, Caen, 1869; Bouclié-Leclerq, Les pontifes de l'anc. Rome, Paris, 1871; Marquardt, Rom. Staatsverwalt., vol. iii. p. 290 sq. ∙ r∣ i [9:20:687]Voigt, founding on a few words in Festus, concludes it must have been by something like pignoris eapio. This recuperatory procedure in time came to be resorted to in some cases even where both parties were citizens. There are numerous instances of it in Cicero; and it is remarkable that in most of the praetorian actions ex delicto the remit was not to a judex but to recuperators. The explanation may be in the comparative summariness of the remedy.

III. Development of the Substantive Institutions of the Law.

The Citizen and his “Cαput"— The early law of Rome was essentially personal, not territorial. A man enjoyed the benefit of its institutions and of its protection, not because he happened to be within Roman territory, but because he was a citizen,—one of those by whom and for whom its law was established. The theory of the early jus gentium was that a man sojourning within the bounds of a foreign state was at the mercy of the latter and its citizens, that he himself might be dealt with as a slave, and all that belonged to him appropriated by the first comer; for he was outside the pale of the law. Without some sort of alliance with Rome a stranger had no right to claim protection against maltreatment of his person or attempt to deprive him of his property; and even then, unless he belonged to a state entitled by treaty to the international judicial remedy of recuperatio, it was by an appeal to the good offices of the supreme magistrate, or through the intervention of a citizen to whom he was allied by the (frequently hereditary) bond of hospitium, and not by means of any action of the jus civile set in motion by himself. A non-oitizen—originally hostis, and afterwards usually called peregrinus ^[35.] —in time came to be regarded as entitled to all the rights the jus gentium recognized as belonging to a freeman, and to take part as freely as a Roman in any transaction of the jus gentium; but that was not until Rome, through contact with other nations and the growth of trade and commerce, had found it necessary to modify her jurisprudence by the adoption of many new institutions of a more liberal and less exclusive character than those of the jus civile.

A citizen’s civil personality was technically his caput. The extent of it depended on his family status. It was only among citizens that the supremacy of the paterfamilias and the subjection of those in manu, potestate, or mαnwpio were recognized,—only among them therefore that the position of an individual in the family was of moment. While in public life a man’s supremacy or subjection in the family was immaterial, in private life it was the paterfamilias alone who enjoyed full jural capacity. Those subject to him had a more limited personality; and, so far as capacity to take part in transactions of the jus civile was concerned, it was not inherent in them but derived from their paterfamilias : they were the agents of his will, representatives of his persona in every act whereby a right was acquired by them for the family to which they belonged.

Whenever a citizen either ceased altogether to be a member of a Roman family or passed from one family into another, there was technically capitis minutio or deminutio, except in the cases of filiifamilias and filiaefamilias becoming flamens or vestals; for, though they changed their family, yet it was by passing from a human into a divine one. When a citizen forfeited his freedom, his capitis deminutio was said to be maxima ; he lost all capacity, whether under the jus civile or the jus gentium. When, retaining freedom, he went into exile or joined a Latin colony, or otherwise became a peregrin, the diminution of his capacity was only media or minor·, it was his rights and privileges under the jus civile that alone were affected. When both freedom and citizenship remained, and no more occurred than the severance of his connexion with a particular family (familiae mutatio), the diminution was said to be minima. Very simple illustrations present themselves in the case of a paterf amilias becoming filiusfamilias by adrogation, or a materfamilias passing into the hand of a husband by con-far reation or coemption; in both cases he or she who had been sui juris thereby became alieni juris. This was descent in the family scale. It almost appears as if some of the later Roman jurists assumed, as do many moderns, that such descent or degradation was essential to the idea of minutio capitis ; for Paul accounts for its presence in the case of emancipation—which converted a filiusfamilias into a paterfamilias, and thus manifestly improved his status— by the observation that in the process of release from his father’s potestas a child had to pass, for however brief a period, through a condition of quasi-slavery (mancvpium). But in reality degradation had nothing to do with it. It was immaterial whether the change was from a higher family position to a lower, or from a lower to a higher, ^[36.] or to the same position in the new family that had been held in the old,—as when a filiusfamilias was transferred by his father into the potestas of an adopter, or when the filiifamilias of a person giving himself in adrogation passed with him into the potestas of the adrogator: in every case there was capitis minutio. It was not the change of family position that caused it, but the change of family itself,— the change from one family to another. The civil personality of Titius while a Jiliusfamilias in the potestas of Sempronius,—the expectancy of succession, the agnatic relationships, the derivative capacity for being a party to a mancipation or a sponsio that resulted from the relationship,—all came to an end through the severance of the family tie. He might acquire a new and independent capacity on becoming sui juris by emancipation, or a new derivative capacity on passing into the potestas of Maevius by adoption; but his old personality quoad civilia was extinguished. This is what some of the jurists mean when they say that capitis deminutio was civil death.

The most important consequence of minima capitis deminutio was that it not only extinguished patria potestas where it existed, but severed the bond of agnation between the capite minutus and all those who had previously been related to him as agnates. There was no longer any right of succession between them on intestacy; their reciprocal prospective rights of tutory were defeated, and the minutio of either tutor or ward put an end to a subsisting guardianship, assuming always that it was a tutela légitima or agnatic cura furiosi. Very remarkable, yet quite logical, was the doctrine that the minutio extinguished the claims of creditors of the minutus ; their debtor, the person with whom they had contracted, was civilly dead, and dead without an heir, and therefore there was no one against whom an action of the jus civile could be directed in order to enforce payment. But equity eventually provided a remedy, by giving the creditors a praetorian action in which the minutio was held as rescinded, and which the new paterfamilias was bound to defend on pain of having to give up all the estate [9:20:688]he had acquired through the adrogation or in manum con-veηtio. The Law of the Family Relations.— So far as appears no serious inroad was made by the XII. Tables on the law affecting husband and wife, unless in the recognition of the legality of marriage entered into without any solemnity, and not involving that subjection of the wife to the husband (gnanus) which was a necessary consequence of the patrician confarreation and plebeian coemption. These were left untouched. But it seems to have become a practice with some of the plebeians to tie the marriage bond rather loosely in the first instance,—possibly (as became quite general at a later period) in consequence of objection by the women to renounce their independence and right to retain their own property and earnings, more probably because taking a woman to be merely the mother of their children (gnatrimoηium) had been forced upon them before coemption had been introduced as a means of making her a lawful wife, and so they had become in a manner habituated to it. But there seems also to have been an idea that, as a man might acquire the ownership of a thing to which his legal title was defective by prolonged possession of it, so he might acquire manus, with all its consequences, over the woman with whom he had thus informally united himself by prolonged cohabitation with her as his wife. This had become customary law. The Tables accepted it; all that was needed was to define the conditions under which manus should be held to have been superinduced, and the wife converted from a doubtful uxor into a lawful rnaterfamilias. Hence the provision that, if a woman, married neither by confarreation nor coemption, desired to retain her independence, she must periodically absent herself for three nights from her husband’s house {trinoctialis usutpatio),— twelve months’ uninterrupted cohabitation being required to give him that power over her which would have been created instantly had the marriage been accompanied by either of the recognized solemnities.

Amongst the fragments of the Tables so industriously collected there is none that refers to a wife’s marriage portion bdos); but it is hardly conceivable that it was as yet unknown. Justinian says that in ancient times it was regarded as a donation to the husband with his wife, rather than as a separate estate that was to be used by him while the marriage lasted but to revert to her or her representatives on its dissolution. And it is easy to see that, where there was mαηus, the wife becoming a member of her husband’s family and everything of hers becoming his, such must originally have been its character. Rut even then, when a man gave his daughter {filiafamilias)—who could have nothing of her own—in marriage, and promised her husband a portion with her, there must have been some process of law for compelling him to pay it; and Voigt’s conjecture that an actio dixtae dotis was employed for the purpose has much in its favour. As regards divorce, Cicero alludes vaguely to a provision in the Tables about a man depriving his wife of the house-keys and turning her out of doors, with some such words as “take what is thine and get thee gone.” This cannot have applied to confarreate marriages, which could be dissolved only by the religious ceremony of diffarreation. And even as regards other marriages the statement of the historians is that divorces were few and far between until the 6th century of the city, and that, until the same date, any man who turned his wife away, however serious the ground, without the cognition of the family council was liable to penalties at the hands of the censors.

Of the two or three provisions of the Tables that affected details of the ρatria potestas, which itself was assumed to be so well established by customary law as to need no statutory sanction or definition, one was in the words “si paterfamilias ter filium venum duit, a patre filius liber esto.” This came to be construed by the jurists as meaning that so powerful λvas the bond of the ρotestas that it could not definitively be loosed until the father had three times gone through the process of fictitious sale by which emancipation was effected. But the conception of the law seems to indicate that its original purpose must have been rather to confer a benefit on a son in potestate, by declaring him ipso jure free from it on a certain event, than to place difficulties in the way of his emancipation. “If a house-father have thrice sold his son, the latter shall be free from his father.” It reads as if the intention were to rescue the son from what, by its frequent repetition, was suggestive of a total absence of parental affection rather than reluctant obedience to overwhelming necessity. May not its object have been to restrain the practice, which prevailed to a late period in the empire, of men giving their children to their creditors in security for their loans,—a process that, at the time of the Tables, could be effected only by an actual transfer of the child per aes et libram as a free bondman (mancipii causa), under condition of reconveyance when the loan was repaid?

The nature of the relation between master and slave, like that of manus and patria potestas, seems also to have been too notorious to require exposition in the Tables. We find recorded only two references to it, one dealing with the case of a slave who had a conditional testamentary gift of freedom (ptalu liber), the other with noxal surrender jιoxαx deditw). The provision about noxal surrender in all probability was not limited to a slave; it was to the effect that, if a member of a man’s family (familiaris, i.e., a son or a daughter in potestate or a slave) committed a theft from or did mischief to property belonging to a third party, or a domestic animal belonging to one man did harm to another, the father of the delinquent child, or the owner of the slave or animal, should either surrender him or it to the person injured or make reparation in damages. In course of time the surrender came to be regarded as a means of avoiding the primary obligation of making reparation. But comparative jurisprudence recognizes in the enactment of the Tables a modified survival of the ancient right of an injured party to have the delinquent corpus,—man, beast, or thing,—given up to him to wreak his revenge upon it privately, the modification consisting in the alternative of reparation offered to the owner. This noxal surrender, failing reparation, had gone out of use in the case of daughters in potestate before the time of Gaius, and in the case of sons before that of Justinian; but the law remained unchanged so far as slaves and domestic animals were concerned even in that emperor’s legislation.

Guardianship and the Introduction of the Order of Agnates. —So long as Rome was patrician the gens charged itself with the guardianship of a clansman’s orphaned pupil children and his widow and unmarried daughters above pupilarity after his decease {tutela), as well as with that of male members of his family who were sui juris, but above the age of pupilarity, when they chanced to be lunatic, imbecile, prodigal, or helplessly infirm {cura, curatio, curatela). That was on the supposition, as regarded children, widow, and unmarried daughters above pupilarity, that no testamentary appointment of tutors by their deceased parent had displaced the gens, though whether testamentary nominations were then held competent it is impossible to say. The gens in council, in all probability, appointed one of its members to act as tutor or curator as the case might be, itself prescribed his duties, and itself called him to account for any failure in his administration.

But, as this gentile tutory could not be extended to the plebeians, among whom some law of guardianship was as much required as among their fellow-citizens of the higher order, the decemvirs found it expedient to devise a new one of universal application. The Tables contained no express authority for testamentary nomination of tutors to the widow of the testator, or to his pupil children and grown-up unmarried daughters; but such appointment, if unknown previously, was soon held to be justified by a liberal interpretation of the very inclusive provision, “uti legassit suae rei, ita jus esto.” In the absence of testamentary appointment the nearest male agnates of lawful age were to be tutors. This tutory of agnates was an invention of the decemvirs, just as was the agnates’ right of succession on intestacy. The plebeians had no gentes, at least until a much later period; so, to make the law equal for all, it was necessary to introduce a new order of heirs and tutors. “Tutores . . . ex lege XII. Tabularum in-troducuntur . . . agnati” is the very notable language of Ulpian. And his words are very similar in speaking of their right of succession; for, while he says of testamentary inheritances no more than that they were confirmed by the XII. Tables, he explains that the legitimae hereditates of agnates and patrons were derived from them. ^[37.] The [9:20:689]phrases légitima cognatio, légitima hxreditas, legitimi heredes, tutela légitima, iutores legitimi themselves proclaim the origin of agnation, agnatic inheritance, and agnatic tutory; for, though the word legitimus might be applied to any institution based on statute, yet in the ordinary case it indicated one introduced by the XII. Tables, the law of laws.

A man’s agnates were those of his kinsmen who were subject to the same patria potestas as himself, or would have been had the common ancestor been still alive. A man’s sons and daughters in pole state, therefore, whether the relationship was by birth or adoption, and his wife in manu (being filiae loco) were each other’s agnates. But a wife not in manu was not their agnate; nor were children who had been emancipated or otherwise capite minuti the agnates of either their brothers and sisters or their mother in manu. A man was an agnate of his brother’s children, assuming always that there had been no capitis deminutio on either side; but he was not an agnate of his sister’s children, for they were not ejusdem familiae : they were agnates of their father’s family, not of their mother’s. In like manner, and again assuming the absence of minutio capitis, the children of brothers were each other’s agnates, but not the children of a brother and a sister or of two sisters. Brothers and sisters were agnates of the second degree; ^[38.] a man and his brother’s children were of the third, the children of two brothers (consobrini) of the fourth, and so on,—it being a condition, however, that the kinship should always result either from lawful marriage or from adoption in one or other of its forms.

When, therefore, a man died leaving pupil male descendants or unmarried female descendants who by his death became swi juris, they got their brothers of lawful age as their tutors; if he was survived by his wife, and she had been in manu, her sons, or it might be stepsons, acted for her in the same capacity; in either case they took office as the nearest qualified male agnates. If the widow had no sons or stepsons of full age, and the children consequently no brothers, the tutory devolved on the agnates next in order,—ix., the brothers germane and consanguinean of the deceased husband and father; for they were agnates of the third degree. And so with agnates of the fourth and remoter degrees. Failing agnates who could demonstrate their propinquity, the tutory probably passed to the gens when the ward happened to belong to one. This is nowhere expressly stated; but Cicero gives what he represents to be an enactment of the Tables, making the fellow-gentiles of a lunatic his guardians on failure of agnates; and analogy seems to justify the extension of the same rule to the case of sane pupil and female wards.

The curatory of minors above pupilarity was of much later date than the Tables. The only curatories they sanctioned were those of lunatics and spendthrifts. A lunatic (juriosus) was committed to the care of his agnates, and, failing them, of his fellow-gentiles; and a few words in Festus seem to suggest that arrangements had to be made by them for his safe custody.

Mancipation and the Law of Property.— In the early law there was no technical word for ownership of things; it was an element of the house-father’s manus. In time, although it is impossible to say when, the word dominium came into use; but, so far as can be discovered, it did not occur in the XII. Tables, and must have been of later introduction. In those days, when a man asserted ownership of a thing, he was content to say, “It is mine,” or, “It is mine according to the law of the Quirites.” The distinction was this, that, while the first was sufficient to entitle a man de facto holding a thing as his own to protection against a thief or any one attempting forcibly to dispossess him, the second was necessary when he appealed to a court of law to declare the legality of his title and his right to oust an individual withholding the possession neither theftuously nor by force. It is said by some jurists of eminence that under the law of the Tables what afterwards came to be called “dominium ex jure Quiritium” was competent only in the case of res mancipi,— of a man’s house and farm, and the slaves and animals with which he worked them. But the usucapion (or acquisition by prolonged possession) which they confirmed and regulated undoubtedly conferred quiritarian right; and, as it applied to all things ownable without exception, it seems impossible to maintain that res nee mancipi could not then be held in quiritarian ownership as fully as res mancipi.

The modes in which these two classes of things might be acquired in property were very various. But there was this important difference,—that, while a natural mode of acquisition sufficed in the case of res nec mancipi, some civil one was necessary for the derivative acquisition, at all events, of res mancipi. The most important λvere mancipation, surrender in court, usucapion, and bequest as singular modes, and inheritance, in manum conventiο, adrogation, and purchase of a confiscated estate as universal modes. All these, with the exception of mancipation, applied equally to res nec mancipi. But the commonest of all the modes of transferring things of the latter class was simple tradition. If the transfer was by the owner, with the intention of passing the property, then the simple delivery of possession was enough, unless it was in virtue of a sale; in such a case, and because a vendor had as yet no action for the price, the Tables provided that the ownership should remain with him, notwithstanding the change of possession, until the price was paid or security given for it.

The origin of the distinction between mancipable and non-man-cipable things, and of the form of conveyance by mancipation applicable to the first, has been explained in connexion with the reforms of Servius Tullius Gupra, p. 676). ^[39.] As he introduced it, mancipation (then called mαηripiurn) was not the imaginary sale that Gaius speaks of, but as real a sale as could well be conceived, —the weighing in scales, held by an official, of the raw metal that was to be the consideration for the transfer of a res mancipi, and the handing of it by the transferee to the transferrer, with the declaration that thereby and therewith the thing in question became his in quiritary right,—and all this in words of style, and in the presence of certain witnesses who represented the people, and thus fortified the conveyance with a public sanction. As already shown, there is some reason to believe that, when large quantities of metal had to be weighed, the practice crept in of having this done before the witnesses had assembled; and in the formal act only a single pound was weighed as representing the whole amount. This paved the way for the greater change that resulted from the introduction by the decemvirs of coined money. From that moment weighing became unnecessary. The price was counted out before the ceremony, and sometimes left to be done afterwards; and, though, in that spirit of conservatism that was so marked in the adhesion to time-honoured forms after their raison d' être was gone, the scale-bearer and the scales were still retained as indispensable elements of the mancipation, yet the scales were simply touched by the purchaser with a single coin, in order that he might be able to recite the old formula—“I say that this slave is mine in quiritary right, and that by purchase (for such and such a price ?) with these scales and this bit of copper.” And that one coin, says Gaius, was then handed by the transferee to the transferrer, as if it were in fact the price of the purchase (quasi ρretii loco). Thus transformed, the mancipation was undoubtedly an imaginary sale; for the real price might have been paid weeks or months before, or might not be paid until weeks or months afterwards. The mancipation had become nothing more than a conveyance, and in this form it continued down to the end of the 3d century of the empire to be the appropriate mode of transfer of a res mancipi, or at least of conferring on the transferee of such a thing a complete legal title (dominium ex jure Quiritium). After that, however, it seems gradually to have gone into disuse, being inapplicable to lands out of Italy that did [9:20:690]not enjoy what was called jus Italicum ; and long before the time of Justinian it had entirely disappeared.

The effects of a mancipation, provided the price had been paid or security given for it, were that the property passed instantly to the purchaser, and that the transferrer was held to warrant the transferee against eviction from the moment the price was received. In the absence of either payment or sureties for it, the title still remained with the vendor, so that it was in his power, by means of a real action, to get back what had been mancipated, even though it had passed into the possession of the vendee. The vendor’s liability to the vendee in the event of eviction is usually supposed to have arisen ipso jure, that is to say, without anything expressly said about it; the acceptance by the transferrer of the coin with which the scales had been struck was held to have imposed upon him an obligation to maintain the transferee in possession, under a penalty of double the amount of the price, recoverable by the latter by what is usually called an actio auctoritatis. But this ipso jure obligation did not arise when the mancipation was either really or fictitiously gratuitous,—really, in the case of donations, &c., fictitiously, when, on purpose to exclude the warranty, the recital of the transferee was that the price was a single sesterce.

The right of a vendee to sue an actio auctoritatis arose only when eviction resulted from a decree in a regular judicial process at the instance of a third party disputing his title, and was conditional on his having done all that was necessary on his part to bring his vendor (auctor) into the field to defend his own interests. And the duration of the auctoritas was limited by statute to two years in the case of lands and houses, to one year in the case of other things. As possession for those periods was sufficient to cure any defect in the vendee’s title, it was but reasonable that with their expiry the vendor's liability on his warranty should be at an end.

By a provision of the Tables in the very inclusive terms, “cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, itajusesto,” the importance of mancipation was immensely increased; for any sort of qualification germane to the transaction might be superinduced upon it, and the range of its application thus greatly extended. Such qualifications were spoken of as leges mancipii,— self-imposed terms, conditions, or qualifications of the conveyance, which, as integral parts of the transaction per aes et libram, partook of its binding character and were law between the parties. The matter of oral declaration might be the acreage of lands, their freedom from burdens or right to easements, reservation of a usufruct, limitation of their mode of use, undertaking to reconvey on a certain event, or what not; the result was just so many obligations created per aes et libram, whose contravention or denial (Cicero tells us) was punished with a twofold penalty. Ordinarily the words spoken in the hearing of the witnesses fixed the beginning and the end of the liability; it was enough that they were literally complied with, however much the other party might be injured by something inconsistent with their spirit, or which he had not taken the precaution to require should be made matter of declaration. But there was an exception (although possibly not introduced until long after the Tables) in the case of that particular mancipatory agreement which was known by the name of Jiducia, i.e., where the mancipation was to a creditor in security or to a friend for safe custody, and the engagement was to return the thing mancipated in the one case when the debt secured by it was paid and in the other on demand. In such cases the transferee took the conveyance more in the transferrer’s interest than his own; he became a trustee, entitled to be treated with consideration, and neither mulcted in a twofold penalty when his inability to reconvey was due to no fault of his, nor forced to reconvey until relieved of charges incurred by him in reference to the property. Accordingly it became the practice to import into the mancipation a reference to fides— “fidei fiduciae meum esse aio,” with explanation of the purpose, &c., of the fiducia in the relative lex mancipii ; this had the effect of freeing alike the right of the vendor and the obligation of the vendee from the hard-and-fast lines of they ms strichim, and subordinating them to the principles of bona fides. Of the civil modes of acquiring property on singular title applicable to both res mancipi and res nee mancipi surrender in court {injure cessio) was just a rei vindicatio arrested in its initial stage. The parties, cedent and cessionary, appeared before the magistrate; the cessionary, taking the position of plaintiff, declared the thing his in quiritary right; the cedent, as defendant, was asked what he had to say in answer; and, on his admission or silence, the magistrate at once pronounced a decree (addictio) which completed the transfer, but which might be subject to a condition or other limitation, or even to a fiduciary reservation. It was probably more resorted to for the constitution of servitudes, both real and personal, and transfer of such rights as patria potestas, tutory-at-law of a woman, or an inheritance that had already vested, than for conveyance of property. For it was not only inconvenient, inasmuch as it required the parties to appear before the supreme magistrate in Rome, and could not be carried through by a slave on his owner’s behalf (as mancipation might), but it had the serious disadvantage that it did not ipso jure imply any warranty of title by the cedent or afford the cessionary any action against him in the event of eviction. The reason was that in form the right of the cessionary flowed from the magisterial decree,—“Since you say the thing is yours, and the cedent does not say it is his,, I declare it yours,”—and not from any act or word of the cedent’s, who was passive in the matter.

Adjudication was the decree of a judge in a divisory action, such as one for partition of an inheritance amongst co-heirs; it conferred upon each of them a separate and independent right in a part of what as a whole had previously been joint property.

Usucapion, ^[40. Literature Das Wesen von und in d. rom. Usucapionslehre, Die Grundidee d. Usucapion im rom. Reeht, Labeo, sq.; XII. Tafeln, Nouv. Rev. Hist., sq.] regulated by the XII. Tables, but not improbably recognized previously in a vague and uncertain way, converted uninterrupted possession (ws«s) into quiritary property by efflux of time. The provision in the Tables was to this effect—“usus auctoritas fundi biennium esto, ceterarum rerum annuus esto.” The relation in which the words usus and auctoritas stand to each other has been a subject of much discussion: the prevailing opinion amongst modern civilians is that the first alone refers to usucapion, and the second to the warranty of title incumbent on the vendor in a mancipation, and that both were limited to two years in the case of lands (and, by extensive interpretation, houses), and to one year in the case of anything else. In the later jurisprudence the possession required to be based on a sufficient title and the possessor to be in good faith. But the decemviral code, as is now generally admitted, contained no such requirements; any citizen occupying immovables or holding movables as his own, provided they were usucaptible and he had not taken them theftuously, acquired a quiritary right in two years or one, as the case might be, simply on the strength of his possession. Originally, therefore, it was simply the conversion of de facto possession, no matter how acquired so long as not by theft, into legal ownership when prolonged for the statutory period,—too often the maintenance of might at the cost of right. But in time it came to be regarded rather as a remedy for some defect of title, arising either from irregularity of conveyance or incapacity of the party from whom a transfer had been taken; and with the progress of jurisprudence it developed into the carefully regulated positive prescription which has found a place in every modern system.

The conception of the abstract notion of a real right in (or over) the property of another person (jus in re aliena) is not to be looked for at so early a period in the history of the law as that now under consideration. The rural servitudes of way and water were no doubt very early recognized, for they ranked as res mancipi, and the XII. Tables contained various regulations in reference to the former. Usufruct, too, was probably not unknown; but the urban praedial servitudes bear the impress of a somewhat later jurisprudence. Pignorate and hypothecary rights were unknown as rights protected by action at the time now being dealt with.Between private parties the only thing legally recognized of the nature of a real security was the fiducia that is described above. Approaching more nearly to the modern idea of a mortgage was the security praedibus praediisque required by the state from those indebted to it in assurance of their obligations. Here there was the double guarantee of sureties (jpraedes') and mortgaged lands of theirs (praedia subsig- 2 Hypothecary rights were certainly unknown until near the end of the republic. But Festus (s.v. “Nancitor ;” see Bruns, Fontes, p. 274) speaks of a provision in the Cassian league between Rome and the Latin states of the year 262 U.C.—“Si quid pignoris nasciscitur, sibi habeto” —which makes it difficult to believe that the Romans were altogether unacquainted with pledge or pawn of movables as a transaction of some value de facto if not dejure.

nata); but how they were dealt with when the debtor made default is by no means clear.

f Changes in the Law of Succession.— The two forms of testament of the regal period (supra, p. 674) still remained in use in the early republic; but in course of time they were displaced by the general adoption of that executed with the copper and the scales (testamentum per aes et libram). It seems to be the general opinion that it was to the first two that the words applied which stood in the forefront of the provisions of the XII. Tables about inheritance,—“uti legassit suae rei, ita jus esto.” Whether resort was to the comitia or to the army, the testator’s own will in the matter was henceforth to be supreme. There was to be no more reference to the pontiffs as to the expediency of the testament in view of the interests of the family sacra and of creditors of the testator’s; from legislators, sanctioning a departure from the ordinary rules of succession, the assembled Quirites became merely witnesses,—recipients of the oral declaration of the testator’s will in regard to his inheritance.

The testament with the copper and the scales is depicted by Gaius as a written instrument. But he presents it in what was apparently the third stage of its history. Its probable origin has been explained in describing the result of the Servian reforms upon the private law. It was then not a testament but only a makeshift for one. A plebeian was not qualified in the regal period to make a testament in the comitia; so, instead, he transferred his estate to a friend on whom he could rely with instructions how to distribute it on his death. The transferee was called familiae emptor, because the conveyance was in form a mancipation for a nominal price.

It is not at all unlikely that the same device may occasionally have been resorted to by a patrician who had neglected to make a regular testament, and was seized with mortal illness before he had an opportunity of appealing to the curies. But such a disposition was not a testament, and may not have been so called. A testament was the nomination of a person as the testator’s heir,—sometimes the substitution of an individual of the testator’s choice for the heir assigned to him by law, sometimes the acceptance of the latter but in the character of testamentary heir, so that the testator might be able to impose upon him what burdens he pleased as the tacit condition of heirship. It made the person instituted as fully the representative of the testator after his death as his heir-at-law would have been had he died intestate. The mortis causa mancipation that opened the way for the testament per aes et libram conferred upon the familiae emptor no such character. Gaius says that he stood in place of an heir ifieredis loco), inasmuch as he had such of an heir’s rights and duties as the familiae venditor had it in his power to confer and impose; but the transaction was but a conveyance of estate, -with a limitation of the right of the grantee. It has been argued that, as the law did not recognize conditional mancipation, the conveyance must have operated as a complete and immediate divestiture of the grantee. But this does not follow. For it was quite competent for a man, in transferring property by mancipation, to reserve to himself a life interest; and apparently it was equally competent for him to postpone delivery of possession, without infringing the rule that the mancipation itself could not be «c cerlo tempore. So far as one can see, therefore, there was nothing to prevent the grantee of the conveyance (or quasi-testator) bargaining that he was to retain the possession till his death; and, as the/aww'Zia was an aggregate of estate (universitas rerum) which retained its identity notwithstanding any change in its component elements, he must in such case have been as free to operate on it while he survived as if he had never conveyed it by mancipation.

Cicero incidentally remarks—what indeed the nature of the business of itself very distinctly suggests—that the true testament with the copper and the scales had its statutory warrant, not in the uti legassit suae rei of the XII. Tables, but in the provision contained in the words,—“cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto.” Reflexion on the import and comprehensiveness of these words led the interpreters to the conclusion that there was nothing in them to prevent the direct institution of an heir in the course of the verba nuncupata engrafted on a mancipation. From the moment this view was adopted and put in practice the familiae mancipatio ceased to be a transfer of the testator’s estate to the familiae emptor; the latter’s purchase was now for form’s sake only, though still an indispensable form, since it was it alone that, according to the letter of the statute, imparted efficacy to the nuncupatio. But it was the nuncupatio— the oral declaration addressed to the witnesses—that really contained the testamentary disposition, i.e., the institution of an heir, with such other provisions as the testator thought fit to embody in it. This was the second stage in the history of the testament per aes et libram. The third was marked by the introduction of tablets in which the testamentary provisions were set out in writing, and which the testator displayed to the witnesses, folded and tied up in the usual manner, declaring that they contained the record of his last will.

Gaius narrates the words spoken by the familiae emptor and addressed to the testator as follows :—“Your estate and belongings (familia pecuniaque tua), be they mine by purchase with this bit of copper and these copper scales, subject to your instructions, but in my keeping, that so you may lawfully make your testament according to the statute {quo tujure testamentum faccrepossis secundum legem publicam).” The meaning of the words “in my keeping {endo custodelam meam) ” is not quite obvious; they may have been remnants of an older style, or may be due to a clerical error of the writer of the Verona MS. Certain it is that they no more imported a real custody than a real property in the familiae emptor ; for the testator remained so entirely master of his estate that the very next day if he pleased he might mancipate it anew to a different purchaser, and nuncupate fresh testamentary writings. The nuncupation was in these terms: “As is written in these tablets so do I give, so do I legate, so do I declare my will; therefore, Quirites, grant me your testimony”; and, adds Gaius, “whatever the testator had set down in detail in his testamentary tablets he was regarded as declaring and confirming by this general statement.” To the appeal of the testator the witnesses responded by giving their testimony in words which unfortunately are not preserved; and then the testament was sealed by testator, officials, and witnesses, the seals being outside according to the early fashion.

Although this testament with the copper and the scales was justified in the first instance by the provision of the XII. Tables as to the effect of nuncupative words annexed to a mancipation, yet in course of time it came to be subordinated to that other one which dealt directly with testamentary dispositions, — uti legassit suae rei, ita jus esto. Upon the words riti legassit the widest possible meaning was put by the interpreters: not only was a testator held entitled on the strength of them to appoint tutors to wife and children, to enfranchise slaves, and make bequests to legatees, but he might even disinherit his proper heir {suus heres) in favour of a stranger, so long as he did so in express terms. Institution of a stranger without mention of the proper heir, however, was fatal, at least if the latter was a son; for without express disherison {exheredatio) his father could not deprive him of the interest he had in the family property as in a manner one of its joint owners. It can hardly be supposed that disherison was contemplated by the compilers of the Tables: it was foreign to the traditional conception of the family and the family estate. But it was a right whose concession could not be resisted when claimed as embraced in the uti legassit, although generally discountenanced, and as far as possible restrained by the strictness of the rules imposed on its exercise.

In the absence of a testament, or on its failure from any cause, the succession opened to the heirs ab intestato. So notoriously were the sui heredes entitled to the first place—and that not so much in the character of heirs as of persons now entering upon the active exercise of rights hitherto existing, though in a manner dormant—that the compilers of the XII. Tables thought it superfluous expressly to declare it. “If a man die intestate, leaving no suus heres, his nearest agnate shall have his estate. If the agnate also fail, his gentiles shall have it.” It has been pointed out, in dealing with the tutory of agnates, that the notion of agnation, as a bond distinct from that which connected the gentile members of a clan, was due to the decemvirs. They had to devise a law of intestate tutory and succession suitable alike to the patricians who had gentes and to the plebeians who had none. To put the latter in exactly the same position as the former was beyond their power ; for the fact had to be faced that the plebeians had no gentile institutions, and to create them was impossible.
[9:20:692]

The difficulty was overcome by accepting the principle of agnation upon which the patrician gens was constructed, and establishing an agnatic circle of kinsmen within the sixth degree, to which the gens as a corporation should be postponed in the case of the patricians, and which should come in place of it in the case of the plebeians. It was not perfect equalization, but the nearest approach to it that the circumstances permitted. The difference was that, when the agnates of a plebeian intestate failed, his inheritance was vacant, whereas, on failure of those of a patrician, there was devolution to his gens in its collective capacity. And this devolution was rendered all the more frequent by two “interpretations” put upon the statute,—(1) that, if the nearest agnates in existence declined the succession, those next in degree were not allowed to take it • and (2) that no female agnate could take it except a sister of the deceased intestate. The division among two or more agnates was always per capita, not per stirpes.

The order of intestate succession thus established by the XII. Tables, which prevailed until amended by the praetors probably in the 8th century of the city, was first to the sui heredes of the deceased, next to liis nearest agnate or agnates, and finally, if the deceased was a patrician, to his gens. His sui heredes included those of his descendants in his potestas when he died who by that event (or even after it, but before his intestacy became manifest) became sui juris, together with his wife in manu (who, as regarded his succession, was reckoned as a daughter); but they did not include children whom lie had emancipated or daughters who had passed in manum of a husband. Emancipated children did not even come in as agnates on failure of sui; for emancipation severed the tie of agnation as well as that of potestas. For the same reason no kinsman who had been emancipated, and so cut off from the family tree, could claim as an agnate; for those only were agnates who were subject to the same patria potestas, or would have been had the common family head been still alive.

The opening of a succession (technically dclatio hereditatis) in favour of sui heredes, whether in virtue of a testamentary institution or by operation of law on intestacy, at once invested them with the character, rights, and responsibilities of heirs. No acceptance was necessary, nor, according to the rules of the jus civile, was any declinature competent. They had been all along in a manner joint owners with their parent of the family estate, which by his death had become, nominally at least, an inheritance; and, as he had not thought fit to terminate their interest in it by emancipating or disinheriting them, they were not now allowed to disown it. Hence they were spoken of as necessary heirs {heredes sui et necessarii). A slave, too, whom his owner had instituted in his testament was a necessary heir: he could not decline, and was invested with the character of heir the moment the testator died. Not so with stranger institutes or agnates taking on intestacy: they were free to take or reject the inheritance as they saw fit; consequently an act of acceptance {aditio) was necessary on their part to make them heirs. It was not unusual for a testator, in instituting an heir, to require that he should make a formal declaration of acceptance within a limited time, failing which his right should pass to a substitute, who in turn was required to enter within a certain time; and so on with any number of substitutes, the series ending with one of his slaves, who became heir without entry, and thus saved the testator from the disgrace of post mortem bankruptcy in the event of the inheritance proving insolvent. The uli leyassit of the Tables, as already remarked, conferred upon a testator very great latitude of testamentary disposition, even to the extent of disherison of sui heredes. This was a course, however, that was rarely resorted to unless when a child had been guilty of gross ingratitude, or when the parent had reason to believe his estate was insolvent and desired to protect his children from the responsibilities of inheritance. Usually his sui, if he had any, would be his institutes, and the purpose of the testament either to apportion the estate amongst them as he thought expedient, or to give him an opportunity of appointing tutors, bequeathing legacies, or enfranchising slaves. On intestacy the sui took equally, but per stirpes; that is to say, grandchildren by a son who had predeceased or been emancipated, but who themselves had been retained in their grandfather’s potestas, took amongst them the share to which their father would otherwise have been entitled, instead of taking equal shares with their surviving uncles. It was by no means uncommon, when the whole inheritance descended to sons, for them to hold it in common for many years as partners {consortes} ; but any one of them was entitled at any moment to claim a partition, which was effected judicially, by an arbitral procedure introduced, termed a judicium (or arbitrium) familias erciscundae. Where two or more strangers were instituted testamentarily, whether to equal or unequal shares, if one of them failed either by predecease or declinature his share accrued ipso jure to the others; for it was a rule that very early became proverbial that a man could not die partly testate and partly intestate. There was the same accrual among agnates on intestacy; and both they and stranger testamentary institutes had the same action for division of the inheritance that was made use of by sui heredes.

According to Gaius it was as a stimulus to heirs to enter as soon as possible to an inheritance that had opened to them, and thus make early provision alike for satisfying the claims of creditors of the deceased and attending to his family sacra, that the law came to recognize the somewhat remarkable institution of usucapion or prescriptive acquisition of the inheritance in the character of heir { usucapió pro herede}. Such usucapion was impossible—there was no room for it—if the deceased had left sui heredes ; for the inheritance vested in them the moment he died. But, if there were no sui heredes, then any person taking possession of the property that had belonged to the deceased, and holding it for twelve months without interruption, thereby acquired it as if he were heir: in fact, according to the views then held, he acquired the inheritance itself. Gaius characterizes it as a dishonest acquisition, inasmuch as the usucapient knew that what he had taken ytossession of was not his. But, as already explained, the usucapion of the XII. Tables did not require bona fidcs on the part of the usucapient; he might acquire ownership by prolonged possession of what he knew did not belong to him so long as he did not appropriate it theftu-ously, i.e. , knowing that it belonged to another. But an inheritance unappropriated by an heir who had nothing more than a right to claim it belonged in strictness to no one; and there was no theft, therefore, when a person took possession of it with a view to usucapion in the character of heir. There can be little doubt that on the completion of his possession he was regarded as heir just as fully as if he had taken under a testament or as heir-at-law on intestacy,—that is to say, that he was held responsible to creditors of the deceased and required to charge himself with the family sacra. Gaius does not say as much; but both the Coruncanian and the Mucian edict imposed the latter burden upon him who had usucapted by possession the greater part of a deceased person’s estate; and it is but reasonable to suppose that the burden of debts must in like manner have fallen on the usucapient or usucapients in proportion to the shares they had taken of the deceased’s property.

The Lau) of Obligations.— The jurists of the classical period attribute obligation either to contract, or delict, or miscellaneous causes (variae causarum figurad) ; and those arising from contract fill a place in the later jurisprudence vastly greater than those arising from delict. In the XII. Tables it was very different. In them delicts were much more prominent than contracts,—wrongs entitling the sufferer to demand the imposition of penalties upon the wrongdoer that in most cases covered both reparation and punishment. The disproportion in the formulated provisions in reference to the two sources of obligation, however, is not surprising. For, first of all, the purpose of the decemviral code was to remove uncertainties and leave as little as possible to the arbitrariness of the magistrates. In nothing was there more scope for this than in the imposition of penalties; and, as different offences required to be differently treated, the provisions in reference to them were necessarily multiplied. In the next place, the intercourse that evokes contract was as yet very limited. Agriculture was the occupation of the great majority; trade and commerce were more backward than in the later years of the regal period; coined money was just beginning to be used as a circulating medium. Lastly, the safeguards of engagement then lay to a great extent in the sworn oath or the plighted faith, of which the law had hardly begun to take cognizance, but which found a protection quite as potent in the religious and moral sentiments that had so firm a hold on the people.

It may be asked—If a man purchased sheep or store cattle, a plough, a toga, a jar of wine or oil, had he no action to compel delivery, the vendor no action for payment of the price? Did the hire of a horse or the loan of a bullock create no obligation? "Was partnership unknown and deposit and pledge and suretyship in [9:20:693]any other form than that of vadimonium i One can have no hesitation in answering that, as transactions of daily life, they must all have been more or less familiar. It does not follow, however, that they were already regulated by law and protected by the ordinary tribunals. The historical jurists are pretty well agreed that not only the real contracts of loan (mutuum and commodatum), deposit, and pledge, but also the consensual ones of sale, location, partnership, and mandate, and the verbal one of suretyship, were as yet very barely recognized by law. Sale was the offspring of barter,—of instant exchange of one thing for another. With such instant exchange there was no room for obligation to deliver on either side, even when the ware (merx) given by one of the parties was so much rough copper weighed in the scales. The substitution of coined money for the raw metal can hardly have effected any radical change: the ordinary practice of those early times must still have been ready-money transaction,—an instant exchange of ware for price; and it can only have been when, for some reason or other, the arrangement was exceptionally for delivery or payment at a future date, say next market day, that obligation was held to have been created. Was that obligation enforcible by the civil tribunals? Some jurists hold that it was,—that at no time were the jus gentium contracts outside the protection of judicial remedies, although by a simpler procedure than that resorted to for enforcement of the contracts of the jus civile. But two provisions in the XII. Tables seem to prove very clearly that it was not so enforcible. The first is one recorded by Justinian,— that, where a thing was sold and delivered, the property, nevertheless, was not to pass until the price had been paid or sureties (nodes) for it accepted by the vendor. Far from being a recognition of the obligatory nature of the transaction, this provision is really a recognition of the inability of the law to enforce payment of the price by the vendee; it is a declaration that, on the latter’s failure to pay, the vendor, unprotected by any personal action, should be entitled to get back the thing sold as still his own, no matter in whose hands he found it. The second related to the case of a person who had bought a victim for sacrifice, but had failed to pay for it. A real action for its revindication by the seller after it had been consumed on the altar was out of the question; so he was authorized by the Tables, by the process of pignoris capio (supra, p. 686), at his own hand to appropriate in satisfaction a sufficient equivalent out of the belongings of the purchaser, against whom he had no personal action.

It was a principle of the law of Rome through the whole of its history, though in course of time subject to an increasing number of exceptions, that mere agreement between two persons did not give him in whose favour it was conceived a right to demand its enforcement. To entitle a man to claim the intervention of the civil tribunals to compel implement of an engagement undertaken by another, it was necessary (subject to those exceptions) either that it should be clothed in some form prescribed or recognized by the law, or that it should be accompanied or followed by some relative act which rendered it something more than a mere interchange of consent. Under the jurisprudence of the XII. Tables the formalities required to elevate an agreement to the rank of contract and make it civilly obligatory sometimes combined ceremonial act and words of style, sometimes did not go beyond words of style, but ill all cases took place before witnesses. Dotis dictio, the undertaking of a parent to provide a dowry with his daughter whom he was giving in marriage, and vadimonium, the guarantee of a surety for the due fulfilment of the undertaking either of a party to a contract or a party to a litigation, probably required nothing more than words of style before persons who could if necessary bear witness to them; whereas an engagement incident to a mancipation, or an undertaking to repay borrowed money, required in addition a ceremony with the copper and the scales. This undertaking to repay arose from the contract of nexum, which was older than the Tables; both it and the verbal contract by sponsio or stipulation, which was younger, merit further consideration. The Nexal Contract ^[41. Literature-.— Verm. Schriften, sq. Vom Nexum, De juris Rom. nexo et mandpio, De Lege Poetilia Papiria, Das Nexum, Ueber d. Recht des Nexum, Des Nexi ou de la condition des débiteurs chez les Romains, Die Aktionen des röm. Privatrechts, Le Nexum . . . en droit Romain, obligatio,” Zeitschr., sq.; XII. Tafeln, resumS Gesch. d. rom. Rechts,] 1— The tumults and seditions so frequent in Rome during the first two centuries of the republic are more frequently attributed by the historians to the abuses of the law of debt than to any other cause, social or political. The circumstances of the poorer plebeians were such as to make it almost impossible to avoid borrowing. Their scanty means were dependent on the regular cultivation of their little acres, and on each operation of the agricultural year being performed in proper rotation and at the proper season. But this was every now and again interfered with by wars which detained them from home at seed-time or harvest, practically rendering their farms unproductive and leaving them and their families in straits for the commonest necessaries of life. A poor peasant, in such a case, had no alternative but to apply to a capitalist for a loan. But it was not to be had without security, and rarely without interest. It was not that the lender doubted the borrower’s honesty and willingness to repay his debt; it was rather that there was every chance that next year a fresh war might again interfere with the latter’s agricultural operations, leave him again without a crop, and thus render repayment impossible. And so, while interest accumulated and was periodically added to capital, new loans had year after year to be contracted as long as any acres remained that could serve as a security; failing all things, the debtor had to impledge or hypothecate himself ^[42. (in servitium),] for, phrase it how we may, this was substantially the result of the contract of nexum.

The practice of lending per libram was doubtless of great antiquity,—indeed the intervention of the scales was a necessity when money or what passed for it had to be weighed instead of counted; and not improbably old custom conceded to a lender who had thus made an advance in the presence of witnesses some very summary and stringent remedy against a borrower who failed in repayment. How Servius subjected it to much the same formalities as he appointed for mancipation—the state scales, the official libripens, the five witnesses representing the nation—has been shown already. With the introduction of a coinage the transaction, instead of being per libram simply, became one per aes et libram ; the scales were touched with a single piece, representing the money which had already been or was about to be paid, a formula recited whereby the obligation of repayment was imposed on the borrower, and an appeal made to the witnesses for their testimony. Unfortunately this formula is nowhere preserved. Huschke and Giraud, assuming that the lender was the only speaker, formulate it thus—“quod ego tibi mille libras hoc aere aeneaque libra nexas dedi, eas tu mihi post annum jure nexi dare damrtas esto”—“whereas with this coin and these copper scales I have given thee a thousand asses, be thou therefore bound jure nexi to repay them to me a year hence.” The phrase damnas esto, like the rest of the formula, is unsupported by any conclusive authority; but, as it was that most frequently employed in the republic for imposing by a public act liability to pay a fixed and definite sum, it may not be wide of the mark.

What was the effect of this procedure? The question is one not easily answered. Brinz has expressed the opinion that the creditor was entitled in virtue of the nexum to take his debtor into custody at any time when he considered such a course necessary for his own [9:20:694]protection, even before the conventional term of repayment,—that the debtor was in bonds, virtually a pledge, from the very first, and the tightness or looseness of them a matter in the discretion of his creditor. ^[43. Zeitschr., nexus res obligata, res nexa. obligata] Voigt holds that the ncxum did not give the creditor any peculiar hold over his debtor, and that on the latter’s failure to repay an ordinary action was necessary, to be followed by the usual proceedings in execution if judgment was in favour of the former. These views may be said to be the two extremes; and between them lie a good many others, more or less divergent. The difficulty of arriving at a conclusion is caused to some extent by the ambiguity of the words nexus and ncxum. The transaction itself was called b«k»»; the money advanced was ncxum acs (hence ncxi, i.e., aeris datio); the bond was nexus (of the fourth declension); and the debtor on whom the bond was laid was also nexus (of the second). All this is simple enough. But we find the same word nexus employed by the historians as almost synonymous with vinctus, —to denote the condition of a debtor put in fetters by his creditor. That might be the condition either of a nexal borrower or of an ordinary judgment-debtor. The former in such a case was doubly nexus ; he was at once in the bonds of legal obligation and in those of physical constraint. In many passages in which Livy and others speak of the nexi it is extremely difficult, sometimes impossible, to be sure in which sense they use the word. It is therefore not surprising that there should be considerable diversity of opinion on the subject, and such frequent identification of the legal status of a nexal debtor {nexus) with that of a judgment-debtor (judicatus).

Almost all writers—Voigt ^[44. actio pecuniae nuncupatae.] is a distinguished exception—concur in opinion that the nexal contract entitled the creditor, after expiry of thirty days from the conventional date of repayment of the loan, to proceed against his debtor by manus injectio without any antecedent action or judgment, and failing settlement to detain him, and put him to servile labour and subject him to servile treatment, until the loan was repaid. The parallel of such a course is to be met with amongst all ancient nations,—Jews, Greeks, Scandinavians, Germans, &c ^[45. Zeitschr., iirl aoinan Savcifav, {Form.,] And it was not altogether unreasonable. If a borrower had already exhausted all available means of raising money, had sold or mortgaged everything he possessed of any value, what other course was open to him in his necessity except to im-pledge himself? That the creditor should have been entitled to realize the right he had thus acquired without the judgment on it of a court of law is equally intelligible: The nexal contract was a public act, carried out in the presence of the representatives of the people, who Were witnesses alike of the acknowledgment of indebtedness and of the tacit engagement of the debtor. The only valid objection that could be stated against the creditor’s apprehension of his debtor in execution was that the indebtedness no longer existed, —that the loan had been repaid. But a nexal debt could be legally discharged only by nexi liberatio, which also was a solemn procedure per acs et libram in the presence of five citizen witnesses. What need for a judicial inquiry in the presence of facts so notorious? A creditor would rarely be daring enough to proceed to manus injectio if his loan had been repaid; if he did, the testimony of the witnesses to the discharge would at once procure the release of his alleged debtor. It was probably to give opportunity for such proof, if there was room for it, that the XII. Tables required that a creditor who had apprehended a nexal debtor should bring him into court before carrying him off into detention.

But there was no room for the intervention of a vindex or champion, for there was no judgment whose regularity he could impugn. Nor was there any room for a magisterial addictio of the debtor to his creditor; for the latter’s right of detention was founded on contract, and needed no decree to strengthen it. The creditor was entitled at once, after apprehension of his debtor and production of him in court in terms of the statute, to carry him home with him, take such steps as were necessary to ensure his safe custody, and employ his services in profitable industry. But that he could kill him or sell him, as some suppose, is a proposition that is destitute of any authority to support it. Equally untenable is the notion that the nexus became a slave, or that, while retaining his freedom, his wife, children, and belongings fell with him into the hands of his creditor. He certainly was not in a worse position than an addictus, of whom Quintilian states distinctly that he still retained his position in the census and in his tribe. Many a time, when the exigencies of the state required it, were the ncxi temporarily released in order to obey a call to arms,—to fulfil the duty incumbent on them as citizens. In fact a nexal debtor suffered no capitis demin-•utio at all because of his detention. If he was a house-father he still retained his manus over his wife and potestas over his children. But they did not share his quasi-servitude. Their earnings legally belonged to him, but were no doubt retained by them with his consent for their own support. They certainly did not fall to his creditor. It was the body of his debtor that he was entitled to, and too often he wreaked his vengeance on it by way of punishment; there was as yet no machinery for attaching the debtor’s goods in substantial reparation for the loss caused by his breach of contract.

The abuses to which the system gave rise alike in the case of nexal and of judgment debtors have already been alluded to. In the year 428 a more than ordinarily flagrant outrage committed by a creditor upon one of his young nexi, who, Livy says, had given himself up as responsible for a loan contracted by his deceased father, roused the populace to such a pitch of indignation as to necessitate instant remedial legislation. The result was the Poe-tilian law {Lex Poetilia Papiria). So far as can be gathered from the meagre accounts of it we possess, it contained at least these three provisions—(1) that fetters and neck, arm, or foot blocks should in future be applied only to persons undergoing imprisonment for crime or delict; (2) that no one should ever again be the nexus of his creditor in respect of borrowed money; and (3) that all existing nexi qui bonam copiami jurarent should be released. The first was intended to prevent unnecessary restraint upon judgment-debtors formally given over to their creditors. The second did not necessarily abolish the contract of loan per acs et libram, but only what had hitherto been an ipso jure consequence of it,—the creditor’s right to incarcerate his debtor without either the judgment of a court or the warrant of a magistrate. For the future, execution was to be done against a borrower only as a judgment-debtor formally made over to his creditor by magisterial decree, and under the restrictions and limitations imposed by the Poetilian law itself. This very soon led to the disuse of nexal obligation; once it was deprived of its distinctive processual advantages it rapidly gave place to the simpler engagement by stipulation enforceable per con-dictionem. As for the release of the then existing nexi, Cicero, Livy, and Dionysius say nothing of any condition annexed to the boon the statute conferred upon them; it is only'Varrò who limits it to those qui bonam copiam jurarunt,— those apparently who were able to declare on oath that they had done their best and could do no more to meet their creditors’ claims. Such a limitation can hardly be called unreasonable, even were we to assume—as probably we ought to do—that the release spoken of was only from the bonds of physical restraint, not from those of legal obligation.

Introduction of the Stipulation ^[46. Literature Die Stipulation u. das einfache Versprechen, Krit. Jahrb., sq., sq. Die formellen Verträge d. röm. Rechts, sq. Die Lehre vom Creditum, Der sacrcde Schutz imröm. Rechte, sq. Zur Lehre von den Formalcontracten, Jus nat., die., d. Röm., Die Stipulation, Aktionen, Die Stipulation,] Few events in the history of the private law were followed by more far-reaching consequences than the introduction of the stipulation. It exercised an enormous influence on the law of contract; for by means of it there was created a unilateral obligation that in time became adaptable to almost every conceivable undertaking by one man in favour of another. By the use of certain words of style in the form of question and answer any lawful agreement could thereby be made not only morally but legally binding, so that much which previously had no other guarantee than a man’s sense of honour now passed directly under the protection of the tribunals. Stipulations became the complement of engagements which without them rested simply on good faith, as when a vendor gave his stipulatory promise to his vendee to guarantee peaceable possession of the thing sold or its freedom from faults, and the vendee in turn gave his promise for payment of the price. The question and answer in the form prescribed by law made the engagement fast and sure. Hence the generic name of the [9:20:695]contract; for Paul’s derivation of it from stipulum, “ firm,” is much to be preferred to the earlier and more fanciful ones from stips or stipula. It was round the stipulation that the jurists grouped most of their disquisitions upon the general doctrines of the law of contract,—capacity of parties, requisites of consent, consequences of fraud, error, and intimidation, effects of conditions and specifications of time, and so forth. It may well be said, therefore, that its introduction marked an epoch in the history of the law.

There is, however, no certainty either as to the time or as to the manner of its introduction. So far as appears it was unknown at the time of the compilation of the XII. Tables, at least in private life; one of the first unmistakable allusions to it is in the Aquilian law of 476 u.c. The mention of it in that enactment, however, is with regard to a phase of it which cannot have been reached for many years after it had come into use; and the probability is that it originated before the middle of the 5th century, its first statutory recognition being in the Silian law introducing the legis actio per condictionem {supra, p. 683). In its earliest days it bore the name not of stipulatio but of sponsio, for the reason that the interrogatory of the party becoming creditor was invariably formulated with the word spondes—c.g., centum dare spondes t— while the answer was simply spondeo.

There has been much speculation as to the origin of the contract. Modern criticism has three theories,—(1) that it was the verbal remnant of the nexum, after the business with the copper and the scales had gone into disuse; (2) that it was evolved out of the oath at the great altar of Hercules and the appeal to Fides {supra, p. 675); (3) that it was imported from Latium, which it had reached from some of the Greek settlements farther south. The last view is the most probable. Verrius Flaccus, as quoted by Festus, connects it with the Greek anevbeu> and airovSn ; and Gaius incidentally observes that it was said to be of Greek origin. A libation {trirovS-ti) is frequently referred to by Homer and Herodotus as an accompaniment of treaties and other solemn covenants,— a common offering by the parties to the gods which imparted sanctity to the transaction. Leist ^[47. Grseco-Ittdische Rechtsgeschichte, sponsionis vinculum] is of opinion that the practice passed into Sicily and Lower Italy, but that gradually the libation and orher religious features were dropped, although the word airouSg was retained in the sense of an engagement that bound parties just as if the old ritual had been observed, and that it travelled northward into Latium and thence to Home under the name of sponsio, being used in the first instance in public life for the conclusion of treaties, and afterwards in private life for the conclusion of contracts. The meaning of spondes as a question by a creditor to his debtor (although latterly, we may well believe, unknown to them) thus came to be—“Do you engage as solemnly as if the old ceremonial were gone through between us?” There are many examples of such simplification of terms, none more familiar than when a man says—“I give you my oath upon it,” without either himself or the individual addressed thinking it necessary to go through the form.

It is not a little remarkable that, although the idea was derived from abroad, the use of the words spondes and spondeo in contracting were, down at least to the time of Gaius, confined in Rome to Roman citizens. The sponsio as a form of contract was essentially juris civilis. So at first were the later and less solemn forms of stipulation,— promittisne? promitto, dabisne 1 dabo, and the like. Gaius speaks of these as juris gentium, i.e., binding even between Romans and peregrins. Such they became eventually, but not until towards the end of the republic. Yet, although juris civilis, both the sponsio and the later forms were from the first free from many of the impediments of the earlier actus legitimi. No witnesses were required to assist at them; and they were always susceptible of qualification by conditions and terms. It was very long, however, before parties had much latitude in their choice of language ; spondeo was so peculiarly solemn that no equivalent could be admitted; and even the later styles may be said to have remained stereotyped until well on in the empire. And it was the use of the words of style that made the contract. It was formal, not material; that is to say, action lay upon the promise the words embodied, apart from any consideration whether or not value had been given for it. In time this serious disadvantage was abated; first by introducing in certain cases words that excluded action in presence of fraud, antecedent or subsequent, on the part of the creditor, and afterwards by praetorian exceptions, such as a plea of “no value,” or by having the contract set aside on the motion of the nominal debtor before proceedings had been taken upon it by the creditor. Originally the stipulation was employed only in regard to engagements whose terms were in every respect definite and certain, and was enforced by the legis actio per condictionem. But in time it came to be employed in engagements that were from the first indefinite. This seems to have been due to the intervention of the praetors, and to have originated after the system of the legis actiones had begun to give place to that per formulas. The remedy in such a case was not spoken of as a condiction but as an actio ex stipulate.

CHAPTER III.—THE JUS GENTIUM AND JUS HONORARIUM.

{Latter half of the Republic.}

I. Influences that operated on the Law. Groivth of Commerce and Influx of Foreigners.— While it may be admitted that commerce was beginning to take root in Rome in the 5th century, yet it was not until the 6th that it really became of importance. The campaigns in which Rome was engaged until the end of the First Punic War absorbed all its energies. But after that time the influx of strangers, and their settlement in the city for purposes of trade, became very rapid,—first Latins and other allies, and afterwards Greeks, Carthaginians, and Asiatics. For them and the regulation of their affairs the jus civile— the law peculiar to Rome and its citizens— was applicable only if they were members of allied states to which commercium and recuperatio were guaranteed by treaty. But multitudes were not in this favoured position; and even those who were soon found the range of Roman modes of acquiring property and contracting obligations too narrow for their requirements. Hence a jus gentium was gradually developed ^[48. jus gentium, Das jus 'naturale, aequum et bonum, und jus gentium d. Romer, Journal of Philology, sq.] which very early in its history drove treaty covenants for recuperatio out of use; its application may for a time have been limited to transactions between non-citizens or between citizens and non-citizens, but it was eventually accepted in the dealings of citizens inter se and became part and parcel of the jus Romanorum. Gaius and Justinian speak of it as “the common law of mankind,” “the law in use among all nations”; but the language must not be taken too literally. The Roman jus gentium was not built up by the adoption of one doctrine or institution after another that was found to be generally current elsewhere. In the earliest stages of its recognition it was “an independent international private law, which, as such, regulated intercourse between peregrins or between peregrins and citizens on the basis of their common libertas.” ^[49. Jus nat., jus civile, jus gentium, jus naturale] during the republic it was purely empirical and free from the influence of scientific theory, but its extensions in the early empire were a creation of the jurists,—a combination of comparative jurisprudence and rational speculation. To say that it was de facto in observance everywhere is inaccurate; on the contrary, it was Roman law, built up by Roman jurists, though called into existence through the necessities of intercourse with and among non-Romans.

It may be a little difficult for a modern jurist to say [9:20:696]with perfect precision what were the doctrines and institutions of the jm-s gentium as distinguished from the jus civile. But the distinction must have been very familiar to the Romans; otherwise we should not have had the statement of Marcian in reference to the á7róÁiScs,—that they enjoyed all the rights competent to a man under the former, but none of those competent to him under the latter.

Institution of the Peregrin Praetorship.— The prsetorship ^[50. Histoire de la -Triture, Rüm,. Staatsrecht, sq. ¡ Röm. Rechtsgeschichte, sq.] was an outcome of the Licinian laws of the year 387 u.c. Down to the end of the 5th century the praetor then appointed superintended single-handed the administration of justice, alike between citizens and foreigners. But with the altered condition of things in the beginning of the 6th century, and the influx of strangers which has already been alluded to, the "work seems to have been found too onerous for a single magistrate, and a second praetor was appointed. The date is not absolutely certain, although generally assumed to have been about the year 512 u.c.; but Pomponius says distinctly that the creation of the new office was rendered necessary by the increase of the peregrin population of Rome, and that the new magistrate got the name of praetor peregrinus because his principal duty was to dispense justice to this foreign element. After the submission of Sicily and Sardinia the number of the praetors was increased to four and after the conquest of Spain to six; Sulla raised the number to eight, and Caesar eventually to sixteen. But all the later creations were for special purposes; the ordinary administration of justice within the city was left with the representatives for the time of the two earliest, who came to be distinguished as prraetor urbanus (qui jus inter cives dicit) and praetor peregrinus. It would be going too far to speak of the latter as the principal author of the jus gentium; for a large proportion of the actions for enforcing jus gentium rights were civil, not honorary,—a fact which proves that the rights they were meant to protect and enforce had their origin in the jus civile, although moulded to meet new requirements by tacit consuetude and the agency of the jurists. But even in this view the peregrin praetor must have had a powerful influence in giving shape and consistency to the rising jurisprudence, by means of the formulae he adjusted for giving it practical effect.

Simplification of Procedure and Introduction of New Remedies under the ¿Ebutian Laic.— The Lex Aebutia is only twice mentioned by ancient writers, and we know neither its precise date nor its specific provisions. And yet, to judge by its effects, it must have been one of the most important pieces of comitial legislation in the latter half of the republic; for Gellius speaks of it as having given the deathblow to many of the institutions of the XII. Tables, and Gaius couples it with two Julian law’s as the statutory instruments whereby the formular system of procedure was substituted for that per legis actiones. The probability is that it was enacted immediately or soon after the institution of the peregrin prsetorship. Its purpose, whatever may have been its terms, seems to have been to empower the prsetors to adapt existing remedies to altered circumstances, and to fashion new actions on the jus civile for the use of the peregrins to whom the procedure of the legis actiones was incompetent; while it may possibly at the same time have expressly authorized the insertion in the styles to be devised by them of clauses that would give protection when required against claims that in law were well founded but in fact inequitable. But, whatever may have been the actual provisions of the statute, the result was the introduction of a procedure which gradually supplanted that by the “actions of the law,” which was much more pliant than the latter, and whose characteristic was this,—that, instead of the issue being declared by w’ord of mouth by the parties, and requiring in many cases to embody with perfect accuracy the statutory provision upon which it was based, it was now formulated in writing by the praetor, in the shape of an instruction to the judge to inquire and consider, with power to condemn or acquit according to his finding (see infra, p. 707).

Provincial Conquests.— The growth of commerce and the enormous increase of wealth, which made great capitalists and enabled them through the agency of freedmen and slaves to carry on trade on a scale hitherto unknown, and which thus helped to foster the jus gentium, was no doubt due to a large extent to provincial conquests. But these operated also in other directions. The authorities who ftroceeded to the conquered provinces as governors found themselves ace to face with laws and institutions in many respects differing from those of Rome. Political considerations dictated how far these were to be respected, how far subverted. In some provinces, more especially the Eastern ones, it was thought unnecessary to do more than supplement the existing system by the importation of doctrines of the jus gentium and the procedure of the praetor’s edicts; while in others, in which it was deemed expedient to destroy as rapidly as possible all national feeling and every national rallying point, a Romanizing of all their institutions was resorted to, even to the extent of introducing some of the formal transactions which previously had been confined to citizens. But in either case there was a reflex action. The native institution had to be studied, its advantages and disadvantages balanced, the means considered of adapting it to the preetorian procedure, and the new ideas so presented as to make them harmonize as far as possible with the old. All this was a training of no small value for those who, on their return to Rome, were to exercise an influence on legislation and the administration of the law. They brought back with them not merely an experience they could not have obtained at home, but sometimes a familiarity with foreign institutions that they were very willing to acclimatize in Italy. Rome thus enriched its law from the provinces, deriving from them its emphyteutic tenure of land, its hypothec, its Rhodian law of general average, and a variety of other features that were altogether novel. Some of them were sanctioned by tacit recognition, others by edicts of the prsetors; but, in whatever way received, they were indirectly fruits of provincial conquest.

Spread of Literature and Philosophy.— The effect on Roman civilization of the addiction of educated men in the later republic to literature and philosophy is a matter for consideration in connexion with Rome’s general history. It is not proposed to consider here the question how far specific doctrines of Roman law bear the impress of the influence of the schools, especially that of the Stoics; it is a subject much too large to be disposed of in a few lines. ^[51. De exigua vi quam philosophia Grseca habuit in >ffor-manda jurisprvdentia Romana, Hat die Stoische Phil, bedeutenden Einfluss gehabt, Jus not., &c., De Tinfluence du Stoicisme svr la doctrine des jurisconsultes Remains, Gesch. u. System d. Rechts-und Staats-Philosophie,] The matter is mentioned simply for the sake of noting that the spirit of critical inquiry aroused and fostered by literary and philosophical study, seriously and conscientiously undertaken, contributed greatly to promote a new departure in jurisprudence that became very marked in the time of Cicero—the desire to subordinate form to substance, the word spoken to the will it was meant to manifest, the abstract rule to the individual case to which it was proposed to apply it. This was the first effort of what then was called equity to temper and keep within bounds the rigour of the jus strictum. The prsetors, the judges, and the jurisconsults all had their share in it. Although modern jurists are prone to speak of praetorian equity as if it were a thing apart, yet the same spirit was leavening the law in all directions and in the hands of all who had to deal with it, the difference being that the form and publicity of the edict gave to its applications by the prsetors a more prominent and enduring record than was found in the decisions of private judices or the opinions of counselling jurisconsults.

Decline of Religion and Morals.— It would be equally out of place to enlarge here on the causes and manifestations of that decline in religious sentiment and public and private virtue which was fraught with such disastrous results in the later days of the republic. The private law was influenced by it to a considerable extent, alike in those branches which regulated the domestic relations and those which dealt with property and contract.

The ever-increasing disregard of the sanctity of the marriage tie is one of those features in the history of the period which strikes even the most unobservant. While from the first the law had denounced causeless separation and visited it with penalties, in principle it maintained the perfect freedom of divorce,—that it was improper to force persons to continue in the bonds of matrimony between whom matrimonial affection no longer existed. With the simple and frugal habits of the first five centuries [9:20:697]of Rome, and the surveillance of the consilium domesticum, the recognition of this principle produced no evil results; family misunderstandings were easily smoothed over, and divorces were of rare occurrence. But from the time of the enactment of the Maenian law in 586 there seems to have been a change for the worse. It inter alia displaced the family council as a divorce court and transferred its functions in that matter to a, judicium de moribus,—a court of inquiry nominated by the praetor, and having as its duty to decide to what extent there should be forfeiture of the nuptial provisions in case of separation or repudiation. The motives of the statute may have been of the best; but its tendency was injurious, for not only did it indirectly facilitate divorce, but it rendered the idea of it familiar, and overthrew that respect for the domestic council which had hitherto been a check upon it. What wonder that with increasing luxury and licentiousness divorce became so common!

This looseness of the marriage bond, as was naturally to be expected, had its effect on the other family relations. The obligation of a father to provide for his children began to be lightly esteemed. The law—possibly only the interpretation put upon the uti legassit of the XII. Tables— had empowered him testamentarily to disinherit them, or in instituting them to limit their right to a mere fraction of the inheritance; but it was assumed that this power would be exercised with discretion and only when justified by circumstances. But in the latter days of the republic, amid the slackened ties of domestic life, paternal as well as conjugal duty seems to have often been lost sight of, and children disinherited or cut off with a nominal share of the inheritance in order that a stranger might be enriched. This led to the introduction by the centumviral court, without any legislative enactment or praetor’s edict to warrant it, of what was called the querela inofficiosi testamenti,— challenge of a testament by a child whose natural claims had been capriciously and causelessly disregarded. While the practice may for a time have been hesitating and uncertain, yet before long, through means of this querela, the rule came to be established that every child was entitled, notwithstanding the terms of his father’s testament, to at least a fourth (gportio legitima, quarta legitima, the legitim of the law of Scotland and various Continental countries) of what would have come to him had his parent died intestate, unless it appeared that the latter had had adequate grounds for excluding him or limiting him to a smaller share. A parent might in like manner challenge an undutiful testament made by his child to his prejudice; and in certain cases so might brothers and sisters inter se.

The decline of morals had an equally marked effect on the transactions of daily life, calling for precautions and remedies that had not been found requisite in the hey-day of the ttlcttus twv ' Pw/zatwr. Men no longer relied on each other’s good faith unless backed by stipulations, cautions (cautiones), and guarantees. The Rutilian bankruptcy arrangements and the actio Pauliana for setting aside alienations in fraud of creditors indicate a laxity in mercantile dealings that was perhaps an inevitable consequence of the growth of trade and commerce. But, that such remedies as, for example, the exceptio rei venditae et traditae or the exceptio non numeratae pecuniae should have been found necessary—the one an answer to a vendor (with the price in his pocket) who attempted to dispossess his vendee because some of the formalities of conveyance had been neglected, the other an answer to an action on a bond for repayment of money that by some accident had never been advanced—proves that the law had now to encounter fraud in all directions, and that Graeca fides had to a great extent displaced the old Roman probity.

II. Factors of the Law.

Legislation.— It cannot be said that during the period of nearly two centuries and a half embraced within the present chapter the private law owed much to legislation. The vast majority of the enactments of the time referred to by the historians dealt with constitutional questions, municipal and colonial government, agrarian arrangements, fiscal policy, sumptuary prohibitions, criminal and police regulations, and other matters that affected the public law rather than the private. Those of the latter class mentioned by Gaius and Ulpian in their institutional works barely exceed a score in number; and of these not above half a dozen can be said to have exercised a permanent influence on the principles (as distinguished from the details) of the law. Most of them were enactments of the concilium plebis or of the comitia of the tribes, to which ordinary legislation had passed as more readily convened and more easily worked than the comitia of the centuries.

Edicts of the Magistrates ^[52. Beiträge zur Kunde des praetorischen Edicts, Das Edictum Perpetuum, Röm. Rechtsgesch.,] 1 — The practice of propounding edicts was very ancient, and had been followed by kings and consuls long before the institution of the praetorship. It was one of the most obvious ways of exercising the imperium with which the supreme magistrate was invested,—to lay an injunction upon a citizen and enforce his obedience, or to confer upon him some advantage and maintain him in its enjoyment. It was one of the ways in which public order was protected where there had been no invasion of what the law regarded as a right, and where, consequently, there was no remedy by action. That the earlier edicts of the praetors were of this character—issued, that is to say, with reference to particular cases, and what afterwards came to be called edicta repentina or prout res incidit posita— there is little reason to doubt. In time a new class of edicts appeared which got the name of edicta perpetua (or perpetuae jurisdictionis causa proposita),— announcements by the praetor, published on his album (as the white boards displayed for the purpose in the forum were called), of the relief he would be prepared to grant on the application of any one alleging that the state of facts contemplated had arisen. The next year’s praetor was free to adopt the edicts of his predecessor or not; but it was usual for him to do so if they had been found beneficial in practice, he adding to them new provisions suggested by demands made upon past praetors for edicta repentina but which they had not generalized, or even proposing for acceptance some remedy entirely of his own devising. As each new praetor entered upon office he announced his jurisdictional programme,—his lex annua, as it was called from this particular point of view, by far the greater part of it tralaticiivm, i.e., transmitted from his predecessors, and only a few paragraphs, diminishing in number as time progressed, representing his own contribution. And so it went on in the first years of the empire, until the praetorian function was eclipsed by the imperial; and at last, after having, by instruction of Hadrian, been subjected to revision, and consolidated with the edicts of the peregrin praetors and provincial governors, it was sanctioned as statute law for the empire through the medium of a senatusconsult.

There is some reason for supposing that the edict attained considerable proportions in the time of Cicero; for he mentions that, whereas in his youth the XII. Tables had been taught to the boys in school, in his later years these were neglected, and young men directed instead to the praetor’s edicts for their first lessons in law’. Of a few of them the date and authorship are known with tolerable precision; but of the history of the majority, including some of the most important, such as those introducing restitutio in integrum on the ground of lesion through error, absence, minority, and the like, and those revolutionizing the law of succession, we are to a great extent in the dark. It is not necessary to assume either that the Julian consolidation exhibits all the provisions that from first to last appeared on the album, or that those preserved in it were originally in the shape in which they are there presented. It is much more likely that we have in it only those that had stood the test of generations, and that many of them are the result of the combined wisdom and experience of a series of praetors. It was one of the great advantages the edicts had over legislative enactments that they might be dropped, resumed, or amended by a new praetor according to his judgment of public requirements. For the edict w’as viva vox juris civilis,— intended to aid, supplement, and correct it in accordance with the ever-changing estimate of public necessities; and this would have been impossible had its provisions from the first been as stereotyped as they became by the consolidation in the time of Hadrian.

The Edict seems to have contained two parts,—the first what may be called the edict or edicts proper, and the second an appendix of styles of actions, &c., whether derived from the jus civile or from the jus praetorium. The contents of the edict proper were in detail very various, but all devoted to an exposition of the ways in which the praetor meant to exercise his jurisdiction during his year [9:20:698]of office. They were not didactic or dogmatic formulations of law, but rather announcements or advertisements of what remedy he would grant in such and such circumstances, or direct orders to do or prohibitions against doing certain things. A party claiming an action or whatever else it might be under any of them did so not of right, as he would have done had his claim had a statutory or customary foundation, but of grace,—on the strength of the praetor’s promise to grant him what he claimed and make the grant effectual. That was why originally such an action had to be raised and concluded within the particular praetor’s year of office,—a rule which in time, by abuse, was converted into the somewhat different one that a purely praetorian action (i.e., not originally of the jus civile, even though remodelled and regulated by the praetor) had to be raised within a year of the occurrence to which it referred.

As already observed, the praetors’ edicts proceeded to a greater extent than the earlier legislation of the comitia upon lines of equity; that is to say, they set themselves against the strictness and formalism of the jurisprudence of the XII. Tables. Such may be said to have been the general tendency of the edicts as a whole. But it was the tendency of the whole jurisprudence of the time, and by no means peculiar to the praetorian creation. Nowhere in the texts are the praetors spoken of as the mouthpieces of equity as distinguished from law. Such a distinction recurs frequently in Cicero; he identifies aequitas with the spirit of a law or agreement, and jus with its letter, but it is in order to sing the praises not of the praetors but of the pleaders who maintained the former as against the latter, and of the judges who were persuaded by their arguments. Much of what was contained in the Edict might quite as well have been embodied in statute, and we know that in time statute came to its aid; witness a very remarkable provision of it,—“I will give bonorum posscssio as may be enjoined by statute, whether comitial enactment or senatusconsult.”

Of the edicts of the peregrin praetor and their relation to that of his urban colleague little is known. That they differed in some respects there can be no doubt, for in the Lex Rubria (of 706 ?) for settling the government of Cisalpine Gaul the magistrates are directed, with reference to a certain action, to formulate it in the way prescribed in the edict of the peregrin praetor. The latter, therefore, must to some extent have been in advance of that of the urban praetor, probably in this respect, that, being prepared primarily for the regulation of questions affecting non-citizens, it more thoroughly than the other avoided formalities that were competent only to citizens, and thus to a greater extent simplified procedure. The edicts of the provincial governors must have varied according to circumstances, being in all cases composites of provisions, more or less numerous, borrowed from the edicts of the praetors and additions suggested by the peculiar wants of the different provinces for which they were framed (provinciate genus edicendi). As for those of the curule aediles, who amongst other duties were charged with the supervision of markets, their range was very limited, their most important provisions having reference to open sales of slaves, horses, and cattle, and containing regulations about the duties of vendors exposing them, and their responsibility for latent faults and vices.

Consuetude, Professional Jurisprudence, and Res Judicatae.— Great as may be the difficulty experienced by philosophical jurists in defining the ground of the authority of consuetudinary law, there is no room to dispute the importance of its contributions to every system of jurisprudence ancient and modern. The men who first drew, accepted, and endorsed a bill of exchange did as much for the law as any lawgiver has ever accomplished. They may or may not have acted on the advice of jurists; but, whether or not, they began a practice which grew into custom, and as such was recognized by the tribunals as a law-creating one,—one conferring rights and imposing obligations. There is much of this—far more probably than is commonly imagined—in the history of every system of law.

In Rome the process was sometimes wonderfully expeditious; witness what Justinian narrates of the introduction and recognition of testamentary trusts and of codicils to last wills, both in the time of Augustus. It can hardly be doubted that the literal contract per expensilationem originated in the same way, probably in the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century. The keeping of domestic account-books may have been enjoined and enforced by the censors; but it was custom, and neither statute nor praetor’s edict, that made an entry in them to another person’s debit creative of a claim against the latter ior certa pecunia crcdita, that might be made effectual by an action under the Silian law. It must have been in exactly the same way that mutuum, formless loan of money, came to be regarded as the third variety of certa credita pecunia, and to be held recoverable under the same action. True, this could not have been attained without the co-operation of the courts. But then those courts were composed each of a single private citizen, whose office ended with his judgment in the particular case remitted to him, and who was untrammelled by the authority of any series rerum judicalarum. ^[53.] He had simply to decide whether in his view expensilation or formless loan created such an obligation as was covered by the words pecuniam dari oportere. There may for a time have been a divergent practice, contradictory findings, as Cicero says there were in his day upon the question whether aequitas or jus strictum was to be applied to the determination of certain matters; but the gradual ascendency and eventual unanimity of judicial opinion in the affirmative was but the expression of the general sentiment of the citizens, of whom the judiccs were the representatives.

These are but examples of the way in which consuetudinary law was constructed. It required the combined action of the laity and the judiccs, both at times acting under professional advice; in some cases even that of the praetors was necessary. It would have been impossible, for instance, to have introduced the consensual contracts into the Roman system and determined what were the obligations they imposed on either side, without magisterial cooperation in framing the formulae that were to be submitted to the judges. Taking the action on sale as an illustration, the formula substantially was this :—“It being averred that the defendant sold such or such a thing to the plaintiff, whatever, judge, it shall appear that the defendant ought in good faith to give to or do for the plaintiff in respect thereof, in the money equivalent thereof condemn the defendant; otherwise, acquit him.” It is very manifest that the free hand here given to the judge must immensely have facilitated the reception of customary doctrine into the law. The judge was to a great extent the spokesman of the forum; his judgment was formed in accordance with current public opinion, which he had ample opportunity of gauging; it was the reflexion of that general sentiment of right, which, phrase it how we may, is the real basis of all customary law. And so in an action for establishing a right of property in a res nec mancipi. The formula was very simple :—“If it appear that such or such a thing belongs to the plaintiff in quiritary right, then, judge, whatever be its value for the plaintiff, in that condemn the defendant; should it appear otherwise, acquit him.” The primary duty of a judge on such a remit was to determine whether the title on which the plaintiff founded his pretensions gave him a right that came up to property; and it can hardly be disputed that it was by the decisions of a series of judges, in a series of such actions, that the long list of natural modes of acquiring property given by Justinian under technical names was gradually brought into view. Those decisions, whether upon the obligations of a vendor, direct or indirect, or upon the sufficiency of a title founded on by a party averring a right of property by natural acquisition, may in many cases have been arrived at under professional advice, and were in all cases embodied in judgments. But that does not in the least deprive the doctrine deduced from them of its character of customary law. It was not until the empire that the opinions of the jurists submitted to a judge (responsa prudentium, see p. 705) were invested with quasi-legislative authority. During the republic, if a judge deferred to them, it was simply because he regarded them as in consonance with well-qualified public opinion; and what a series of consistent judgments of this sort built up was in the strictest sense a law based on consuetude. ^[54. longa, inveterata consuetude,]

As regards the professional jurists in particular it has already been observed that, according to the testimony of the historians, the law was a monopoly of the patricians down at least to the middle of the 5th century of the city. Livy goes so far as to speak of it as penetralibus pontificum repositum,— among the secrets of the pontifical college. It was so to a very great extent in the regal period. But after the publication of the XII. Tables this could be the case only in a qualified sense, the pontiffs becoming the official interpreters of that which in the letter was patent to the world. The Jus Flavianum, with its formulary of actions, in the year 450, the practice of giving advice in law in public adopted by Tib. Coruncanius in the beginning of the 6th century, and the Jus xElianum, embodying the current interpretatio, some fifty years later, put an end not only to pontifical but to patrician monopoly. From this time onwards there was a series of jurists (prudentes), gradually increasing in number and eminence, of whom a list is given by Pomponius, and many of whom are signalized by Cicero, particularly in his Orator and Brutus. They occupied themselves in giving advice to clients (see Patron and Client, vol. xviii. p. 412), teaching, pleading at the bar, framing styles of contracts, testaments, and various other deeds of a legal character, or writing commentaries or shorter treatises on different branches of the law. ^[55.

III. Substantive Changes in the Law during the Period.

The Publician Edict.— There were necessarily many changes during the period in the law of property and of minor real rights, several of them of no mean importance. But the greatest of all was that effected by the Publician edict ^[56. Theorie de ou de la propriété prétorienne, Jus naturale, sq. Das Recht der Publicianischen Klage, Krit. Vierteljahrschrift, sq. Beiträge zur Kunde d. praetorischen Edicts: Das Public. Ed.,] indirectly recognizing the validity (1) of what Theophilus calls dominium bonitarium as an actual though inferior ownership of res mancipi, and (2) of what got the name of bonae fidci possessio as a fictitious ownership of either res mancipi or res nec mancipi, valid against all the world except the true dominus. The accounts we possess of this edict are somewhat inconsistent and even contradictory; the explanation may be that it went through a process of amendment and expansion at the hands of successive praetors, and that eventually it may have had more than one section, without our always being able to say to which of them the criticism of a particular commentator is directed. But there is no doubt of its general tendency,—of the defects it was meant to correct and of the way in which the correction was accomplished.

One of the defects was this: if a man had taken a transfer of a res mancipi from its rightful owner, but simply by tradition instead of by mancipation or cession in court, he did not acquire dominium ex jure Quiritium, and the transferrer remained undivested. The result was that the latter was in law entitled to raise a rei vindicatio and oust the transferee whose money he might have in his pocket, while if a third party had obtained possession of the thing, but in such a way as not to be amenable to an interdict, the transferee could have no effectual vindication against him, as he was not in a position to prove dominium ex jure Quiritium. The first difficulty was overcome by the exceptio rei venditae et traditae, also a praetorian remedy, and probably older than the Publician; to the transferrer’s vindication on the strength of his unextinguished quiritary right the transferee pleaded sale and delivery as an effectual praetorian defence. But, when a third party was in possession, and the transferee by simple delivery had to take the initiative, the position was more complicated. Such third party might be in perfect good faith; he might even have acquired from the original transferrer and fortified his acquisition with a formal conveyance. But that was no sufficient reason in equity why he should be allowed to defeat the prior right of the original transferee, who, if he had possessed for the requisite period of usucapion before the third party came upon the scene, would have cured the defect of the informal delivery and acquired an unassailable quiritary right. So the praetor announced in his edict that, if a man came to him and represented that he had bought a res mancipi from its owner, and had had it delivered to him, but had lost possession within the period of usucapion, he (the praetor) would allow him a vindication embodying a fiction of completed usucapion (infra, p. 708), with which he might proceed either against the transferrer or any third party withholding the thing in question.

The publication of such an edict and the formula of the action based upon it—which, though of praetorian origin, was in many respects dealt with as an actio juris civilis and just a variety of the rei vindicatio— had the same effect as if the legislature had directly enacted that in future delivery of a res mancipi in pursuance of a sale or other good cause would confer a right of ownership in it even before usucapion had been completed. Till completed, however, the transferee was not quiritary owner: the thing in question was only mi bonis, “of his belongings,” and the legal title, though a very empty one— nudum jus Quiritium— remained in the transferrer; it was only with the completion of the usucapion that it became the transferee’s pleno jure. The inevitable result of the recognition of this tenure in bonis was that mancipation came to be regarded in many cases as an unnecessary formality; and the marvel is that it continued to hold its ground at all. The explanation may be that it afforded a substratum for and gave force of law to the verba nuncupata that accompanied the negotium per aes et libram ; and, although many of these might quite well be thrown into the form of stipulations, yet there were others that it may have been thought safer to leave to take effect under the provisions of the earlier law.

The second case that was met by the Publician edict—whether - as originally published or by an amendment of it cannot be determined—was that of the bona fide transferee of a thing by purchase or other sufficient title who, having lost possession of it before usucapion, found to his cost that the transferrer had not been its owner, that no ownership therefore had been transmitted to him (the transferee), and that consequently he was not in a position to raise a vindication with its averment of dominium ex jure Quiritium. ^[57.] As against the true owner, whose property had been disposed of by a stranger behind his back, there would have been no equity in giving him an action; but as against all the world except the true owner his “better right” was recognized by the praetor, who accorded to him also a vindication proceeding on a fiction of completed usucapion, for usucapion cured the defect of his title, just as it did that of the bonitarian owner. In this way the praetors introduced that bonae fidci possessio which was worked out with much skill by the jurists of the early empire, and which assumed very large proportions in the Justinianian law when the term of prescription had been greatly extended, and the difficulty of proving property (as distinguished from bona fide possession) consequently very much increased.

Development of the Law of Contract. ^[58. Jus naturals,] It is impossible within the limits of an article such as this to indicate a tithe of the amendments that were effected on the law of obligations during the period whose distinguishing features were the rise of a jus gentium and the construction of the praetor’s edict. In every branch of it there was an advance not by steps but by strides,—in that of obligations arising from contract, of those arising from delict, and of those arising from facts and circumstances, such as unjustifiable enrichment at another person’s cost. ^[59. e.g.,] The law of suretyship, in its three forms of sponsio, fidepromissio, and fidejussio, received considerable attention, and formed the subject of a series of legislative enactments for limiting a surety’s liability; while that of agency, which was sparingly admitted in Rome, had a valuable contribution from the praetorian edict in the recognition of a man’s liability, more or less qualified, for the contractual debts of his filiifamilias and slaves, as also, and without qualification, for the debts properly contracted of persons, whether domestically subject to him or not, who were managing a business on his account, or whom he had placed in command of a ship belonging to him. The development of the law in the matter of obligations generally was greatly facilitated by the praetorian simplification of procedure and the introduction of new forms of actions,—the instruction to a judge, “Whatever in respect thereof the defendant ought to give to or do for the plaintiff, in that condemn him,” preceded by a statement of the cause of action, giving wide scope for the recognition of new sources of liability.

The origin of the verbal contract of stipulation and its actionability under the Silian and Calpurnian laws have already been explained (pp. 694, 684). It was theoretically a formal contract, i.e., creative of obligation on the strength of the formal question and answer interchanged by the parties, even though no substantial ground of debt might underlie it; but in time it became the practice to introduce words—the single word recte was enough—excluding liability in case of malpractice (clausula doli); and finally even that became unnecessary when the praetors had introduced the general exceptio doli, pleadable as an equitable defence to any personal action. And it was essentially productive only of unilateral obligation, i.e., the respondent in the interrogatory alone incurred liability; if mutual obligations were intended it was necessary that each should promise for his own part, with the result that two contracts were executed which were perfectly independent. Originally the only words that could be employed were spondesl on the one side, spondco on the other; and in this form the contract was yurts civilis and competent only to citizens (and noncitizens enjoying commercium ?). In time the words promittis I promitto, came to be used alternatively. They seem, eventually at least, to have been competent to peregrins as W’ell as to citizens, although that may not have been until the stipulation had become of daily use amongst the former in the still simpler phraseology dabis I dabo, facies I faciam. Originally competent only for the creation of an obligation to pay a definite sum of money, and afterwards one for delivery of a specific thing other than money, the contract came in time, by the simplification of the w’ords of interrogatory and response—the substitution of the condictions of the formular system for the legis actiones of the Silian and Calpurnian laws, and the introduction of the actio ex stipulatu to meet cases of indefinite promise—to be adaptable to any sort of unilateral engagement, whether initiated by it or only confirmed. It was of immense service too outside the ordinary range of contract in what were called necessary (in contradistinction to voluntary) stipulations, of which a variety of illustrations are given infra, p. 709. In all directions advantage was taken of it to bind a man by formal contract either to do or to refrain from doing what in many cases he might already be bound ipso jure to do or to abstain from doing, and that because of the simplicity of the remedy—an action on his stipulation—that would lie against him in the event of his failure.

A second form of contract that came into use to a considerable extent in the latter half of the republic is wffiat is commonly called the literal contract, or, as Gaius phrases it with greater accuracy,
[9:20:700]

the nomen transscripticium. ^[60. Literature Verm. Schriften, sq. Jahrb. f hist. u. dogm. Bearbeit, des röm. Hechts, sq.; Die formellen Verträge d. röm. Rechts, sq. Die Lehre vom Creditum, sq. De literar. obligatione, Gesch. d. röm. Rechts, sq. resume Rev. de Legislat., sq. Archivio Giuridico, Etudes sur la Novation, sq.; Die Condictionen,] Notwithstanding the prolific literature of which it has been the subject, it must be admitted that in many points our knowledge of it is incomplete and uncertain. The prevalent opinion, formed before the discovery of the Verona MS. had made known Gaius’s description of it, and almost universally adhered to ever since, is that such contracts were created by entries in the account-books which the censors insisted that all citizens of any means should keep with scrupulous regularity. They are often alluded to by the lay writers; but the text principally relied on is what remains of Cicero’s speech for the player Roscius. From the tenor of the argument in that case, and incidental remarks elsewhere, the conclusion has been formed that a citizen who made an entry in his codex— whether of the nature of a cash-book or a ledger is much disputed—to the debit of another, thereby made the latter his debtor for a sum recoverable by an actio certae crcditae pecuniae. Gaius in his description of the contract does not mention the codices ; but his account is not inconsistent with the notion that the entries {nomina) of which he speaks were made in them. He says that those entries were of two sorts, nomina arcaria and nomina transscripticia. The former were entries of cash advances; and of them lie observes that they did not create obligation, but only served as evidence of one already created by payment to and receipt of the money by the borrower. Of the latter he says that there were two varieties, the entry transcribed from thing to person and that transcribed from one person to another, and that both of them were not probative merely but creative of obligation. The first was effected by a creditor (A) entering to the debit of his debtor (B) the liquidated amount of what the latter was already owing as the price of something purchased, the rent of a house leased, the value of work done, or the like. The second was effected by A transcribing B’s debt to the debit of a third party (C), hitherto a debtor of B’s, and who consented to the transaction, —A at the same time crediting B with the sum thus booked against C, and B in his books both crediting C with it {acceptilatio) and debiting A {expensilatio).

All this at first sight seems just a series of bookkeeping operations. But it was much more than that for the Roman citizens who first had recourse to it. There was a time when sale, and lease, and the like, so long as they stood on their own merits, created no obligation enforcible at law, however much it might be binding as a duty to Fides or (as moderns would say) in the forum of conscience; to found an action it required to be clothed in some form approved by the jus civile. The nexum may have been one of those forms, the vendee or tenant being fictitiously dealt with as borrower of the price or rent due under his purchase or lease; the stipulation was another, the obligation to pay the price or rent being made legally binding by its embodiment in formal question and answer. But stipulation was competent only between persons who were face to face, whereas expensilation was competent also as between persons at a distance from each other. This of itself gave expensilation—which, originally at least, was as much a negotiant juris civilis as the sponsio— an advantage in some cases over stipulation. But it had also a further advantage, which was not affected by the subsequent recognition of the real and consensual contracts as productive of legal obligation on their own merits: it paved the way for subsequent transcription from one person to another. This last must have been of infinite convenience in commerce, not only by enabling traders to dispense with a reserve of coin, but by obviating the risks attending the transit of money over long distances. It was this that led, as Theophilus says was the case, to the conversion even of stipulatory obligations into book-debts; it was not that thereby the creditor obtained a tighter hold over his debtor, but that an obligation was obtained from him which in a sense was negotiable and therefore more valuable.

The evolution of the four purely consensual contracts—sale, location, partnership, and mandate—supplies matter for one of the most interesting chapters in the whole history of the law. But, as it is impossible in such an article as this to attempt to mark the successive stages in the progress of all of them, we shall confine ourselves to sale. The others did not and could not follow identically the same course: location ran most nearly parallel with sale; but partnership and mandate, from their nature, not only started at a different point from the other two, but reached the same goal with them—tliat of becoming productive of obligation simply on the strength of consent interchanged by the parties—by paths that were sometimes far apart. Nevertheless a sketch of the history of the origin of the contract of sale may be sufficient to indicate generally some of the milestones that were successively passed by all four. ^[61. Gesch. d. Kaufs im rom. Reeht, Nouv. Rev. Hist., sq., sq., sq.; Zeitschr. d. Savigny Stiftung, Rom. Abtheil., sq.]

Going back as far as history carries us we meet with it under the names of emptio and venditio, but meaning no more than barter; for cmcrc originally signified simply “to take” or “acquire.” Sheep and cattle {pccus, hence pccunia) may for a time have been a very usual article of exchange on one side, and then came raw metal weighed in the scales. But it was still exchange, instant delivery of goods on one side against simultaneous delivery of so many pounds weight of copper on the other. With the reforms of Servius Tullius came the distinction between res mancipi and res nec mancipi, and with it a regulated mancipation for sale and conveyance of the former. It was still barter; but along with it arose an obligation on the part of the transferrer of the res mancipi to warrant the transferee against eviction,—a warranty that was implied in the mancipation. Whether this rule obtained from the first or was the growth of custom it is impossible to say; but it is in the highest degree probable that it was the XII. Tables which fixed that the measure of the transferrer’s liability to the transferee in the event of eviction should be double the amount of the price. Equally impossible is it to say when the practice arose of embodying declarations, assurances, and so forth in the mancipation (leges mancipii), which were held binding on the strength of the negotium juris civilis in which they were clothed. They received statutory sanction in the Tables, in the words already referred to more than once—“cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, itajus esto,” substantially “whatever shall by word of mouth be declared by the parties in the course of a transaction per aes el libram in definition of its terms shall be law as between them.”

The substitution by the decemvirs of coined money, that was to be counted for rough metal that had been weighed, converted the contribution on one side into price {pretium), as distinguished from article of purchase {merx) on the other; and sale thus became distinct from barter. In contemplation of the separation of the mancipation and the price-paying, and the degeneration of the former into a merely imaginary sale, they enacted that, mancipation notwithstanding, the property of what was sold should not pass to the purchaser until the price had been paid or security by sureties {vades) given for it to the vendor; and it was probably by the interpretation of the pontiffs that this was added to the rule,— that until the price was paid no liability for eviction should attach to the transferrer (or auctor). The reason of the provision in the XII. Tables was that a vendor who had mancipated or delivered a thing sold by him before receiving the price had no action to enforce payment of the latter; and in such circumstances it was thought but right to give him the opportunity of getting back the thing itself by a real action. It might be, however, that the price had been paid, and yet the vendor refused to mancipate. It was long, apparently, before the purchaser could in such a case compel him to do so. With the introduction of the legis actio per condic-tionem he (the purchaser) had undoubtedly the power to recover the money on the ground of the vendor’s unjustifiable enrichment, —that the latter had got it for a consideration which had failed {causa data, causa non secuta) ; and it is possible that before that he liacl a similar remedy per judicis poslulationem.

Down to this point, therefore, say the beginning of the 6th century, there were several obligations consequent on sale of a res mancipi ; but not one of them arose directly out of the sale itself, or could be enforced simply on the ground that it had taken place. The vendor was bound to support the purchaser in any action by a third party disputing his right, and to repay him the price twofold in the event of that third party’s success; and he was bound, moreover, to make good to him any loss he had sustained through a deficiency of acreage he had guaranteed, non-existence of servitudes he had declared the lands enjoyed, existence of others from which he had stated they were free^[62. (De Off., per aes et libram i lingua nuncupassit, itajus esto), poena dupli] incapability of a slave for labour for which he was vouched fit, and so on. But these obligations were binding, not in virtue of the sale per se, but of the transaction per aes et libram superinduced upon it; and, if the vendor had at any time to return the price on failure to mancipate what he had sold, it was not because he had committed a breach of contract, but because he had unjustly enriched himself at the purchaser’s expense.

In sales of res nec mancipi, just as in those of res mancipi, a vendor who had been incautious enough to deliver his wares before he had been paid, or had got stipulatory security for the price, or ha I converted it into a book-debt, might recover them by a real action if payment was unduly delayed; while the purchaser who had paid in advance but failed to get delivery might also get back his money from the vendor on the plea of unwarrantable enrichment. But, as [9:20:701]mancipation was unnecessary for carrying the property (and, as some think, incompetent), some other machinery had to be resorted to than that of the copper and the scales for imposing upon the vendor an obligation of warranty against eviction, defects, and so forth. It may be that, until trade began to assume considerable proportions, and when a transaction was between citizens, a purchaser was content to rely partly on the honesty of his vendor, partly on the latter’s knowledge that he ran the risk of an action for theft if what he sold belonged to another ^[63.] and partly on the maxim common in all ages and climes, caveat emptor. When it was one between a citizen and a peregrin, a different set of rules may have come into play; for between them disputes were settled by recuperators whose decisions were arrived at very much on considerations of natural equity. It was the popularization of the stipulation that facilitated a further advance, rendered all the more necessary by the expansion of intercourse with foreigners and the cessation of recuperation.

We read of a satisdatio secundum mancipium, a stipulatio habere licere, and a stipulatio duplae. The nature of the first is obscure; it seems to have been connected with mancipatory sales, and probably to have been the guarantee of a sponsor for the liabilities imposed upon the vendor by the transaction per aes et libram and the verba nuncupata that were covered by it. The stipulation habere licere occurs in Varro, in a collection of styles of sales of sheep, cattle, &c., some of which he says were abridgments of those of M. Manilius, who was consul in the year 605. It was the guarantee of the vendor of a res nee mancipi, or even of a res mancipi sold without mancipation, that the purchaser should be maintained in possession of what he had bought; it entitled him to reparation on eviction, measured not by any fixed standard but according to the loss he had sustained. It cannot have been introduced, therefore, until after the Lex Aebutia and the formulation by the praetor of the actio ex stipulatu. The idea of the stipulatio duplae may have been borrowed from the duplurn incurred by a vendor on the eviction of a purchaser acquiring a thing by mancipation; for one of its earliest manifestations was in the edict of the curule aediles, who insisted on it from persons selling slaves, probably because the dealers were for the most part foreigners, and therefore unable to complete their sales per aes ct libram. Judging from Varro, it was a form of stipulation against eviction that in his time was used only in sales of slaves, although he adds that by agreement of parties it might be limited to a simplum.

We learn from the same writer—what is also indicated in various passages of Plautus—that the vendor at the same time and in the body of the same stipulation guaranteed that the sheep or cattle he was selling were healthy and of a heal thy stock and free from faults, and that the latter had not done any mischief for which their owner could be held liable in a noxal action; and similarly that a slave sold was healthy and not chargeable for any theft or other offence for which the purchaser might have to answer. If any of these guarantees turned out fallacious the purchaser had an actio ex stipulatu against the vendor: ‘ ‘ Whereas the plaintiff got from the defendant a stipulation that certain sheep he bought from him were healthy, &c. [repeating the words of guarantee], and that he, the plaintiff, should be free to hold them {habere licere'), whatever it shall appear that the defendant ought in respect thereof to give to or do for the plaintiff, in the value thereof, judge, condemn him; otherwise, acquit him.” It is an observation of Bekker’s ^[64. Aktionen,] ' that the actio empti in its original shape was just a simplification of the actio ex stipulatu on a vendor’s guarantees; the stipulations to which we have been alluding had become such unfailing accompaniments of a sale as to be matters of legal presumption, the result being that the words “whereas the plaintiff bought from the defendant the sheep about which this action has arisen” were substituted in the demonstratio (as the introductory clause of the formula was called) for the detailed recital of what had been stipulated. Bekker justifies this by reference to the language of Varro, who seems to include under the words emptio, venditio not merely the agreement to buy and sell but also the stipulations that usually went with it.

The introduction of an actio empti in this shape, however, was far from the recognition of sale as a purely consensual contract. If the price was not paid at once, the purchaser gave his stipulatory promise for it, or got some one on whom the vendor placed more reliance to do so for him, or else made a book-debt of it; and, if it had to be sued for, it was in all these cases by a condictio ccrti and not by an action on the sale. If the price was paid but the thing purchased not delivered, the only remedy open to the purchaser was to get back his money by the same condiction, unless, indeed, the guarantee habere licere was held to cover delivery, in which case the purchaser might obtain damages in an actio ex stipulatu, under the name of actio empti. But this actio empti, whether insisted on on the ground of non-delivery, eviction, or breach of some other warranty, was really an action on the verbal contracts that had accompanied the sale,—a strictum fus action in which the judge could not travel beyond the letter of the engagements of the purchaser. In the latter years of the republic, and probably from the time of Q. Mucius Scsevola, it was a bonae fidei action. How had the change come about? A single case of hardship may have been sufficient to induce it, such as the defeat of a claim for damages for eviction on the ground that the stipulatory guarantee had been accidentally overlooked. Ulpian says, “As the stipulatio duplae is a thing of universal observance, action on the ground of eviction will lie ex empto if perchance the vendor of a slave have failed to give his stipulatory guarantee, for everything that is of general custom and practice ought to be in view of the judge in a bonae fidei judicium.” ^[65. Dig.,]

Very little was required to convert the stricti juris actio empti, really nothing more than an actio ex stipulatu, into a bonae fidei one,—simply the addition by the prsetor of the words “on considerations of good faith” {ex fide bona) to the “whatever the defendant ought to give to or do for the plaintiff.” The effect, however, was immeasurable,—not that it did away with the practice of stipulatory guarantees, for Varro wrote after the time of Q. Mucius (who speaks of the action on sale as a bonae fidei one), and references to them are abundant in the pages of the classical jurists; but it rendered them in law unnecessary. It made sale a purely consensual contract in which, in virtue of the simple agreement to buy and sell, all the obligations on either side that usually attended it were held embodied without express formulation or (still less) stipulatory or literal engagement. And, in instructing the judges to decide in every case between buyer and seller suing ex empto or ex vendito on principles of good faith, it really empowered them to go far beyond “general custom and practice,” and to take cognizance of everything that in fairness and equity and common sense ought to influence their judgment, so as to enable them freely to do justice between the parties in any and every question that might directly or indirectly arise out of their relation as seller and buyer.

The history of the four nominate real contracts— mutuum {i.e., 1 loan of money or other things returnable generically), commo-1 date {i.e., loan of things that had to be returned specifically), deposit, and pledge—is more obscure than that of the consensual ones. ^[66. Creditum, sq., sq. Loci Plautini de rebus creditis, Zeitsehr. f. Rechtsgesch,, sq. Aktionen, sq. Zur Gesch. d, benannten Realcontraete, Lehre vom Darlehn,] Down to the time of the Pcetilian law loan of money, corn, &c., was usually contracted per aes et libram', and it is probable that after the abolition of the nexum the obligation on a borrower to repay the money or corn advanced to him was made actionable, under the Silian and Calpurnian laws respectively, by a stipulation contemporaneous with the loan. With the rise of the/its gentium loan became actionable on its own merits,—that i3 to say, the advance and receipt of money as a loan of itself laid the borrower under obligation to repay it, even though no stipulatory engagement had intervened; the res (in this case the giving and receiving mutui causa) completed the contract. The obligation that arose from it was purely unilateral, and enforcible, where the loan was of money, by the same action as stipulation and literal contract; and so strictly was it construed that interest on the loan was not claimable along with it, the res given and received being the full measure of the obligation of repayment. The other three— commodate, deposit, and pledge—became independent real contracts very much later than mutuum, possibly not all at the same time, and none of them apparently until very late in the republic. All of them, of course, had been long known as transactions of daily life; the difficulty is to say when they first became actionable, and under what guise.

It is impossible within the space at our command to criticize the various theories entertained of their vicissitudes, for they necessarily vary to some extent in regard to each. We must content ourselves, therefore, with the simple statement that eventually, and within the period with which we are now dealing, they came to be recognized as independent real contracts, the res by which they were completed being the delivery of a thing by one person to another for a particular purpose, on the understanding that it was to be returned when that purpose was served. And it is to be noted that, while mutuum transferred the property of the money lent, the borrower being bound to return not the identical coins but only an equal amount," in pledge it was only the possession that passed, while in commodate and deposit the lender or depositor retained both property and (legal) possession, the borrower or depositary having nothing more than the natural detention. In all but mutuum, therefore, there was trust; the holder was bound, to an extent varying according to circumstances, to care for what he held as if it were his own, and entitled to be reimbursed for outlay on its maintenance,—bound to return it, yet excused if his failure to do so was due to a cause for which in fairness he could not be held responsible. Consequently the actions on these three contracts, differing from that on mutuum, were all bonae fidei, the [9:20:702]judge being vested with full discretion to determine wliat was fair and equitable in each individual case.

Prsetorian Amendments on the Law of Succession.— The most important change in the law of succession during the latter half of the - republic was due to the praetors. They introduced, tinder the name of bonorum possessio ^[67. résumé honorum possessio, Geschichle d. rom. Hechts, Pandeeten-Commentar,] what was really beneficial enjoyment of the estate of a deceased person without the legal title of inheritance. There is much to lead to the conclusion that the series of provisions in regard to it which we find in the Julian consolidation of the Edici were the work of a succession of praetors, some of them probably not under the republic but under the empire; but it will be convenient to give here a general view of the subject as a whole, disregarding the consideration that some of its features may not have Deen given to it within the period now under notice.

J ustinian, speaking of the origin of bonorum possessio, observes that in promising it to a petitioner the praetors were not always actuated by the same motives; in some cases their object was to facilitate the application of the rules of the jus civile, in some to amend their application according to what they believed to be the spirit of the XII. Tables, in others, again, to set them aside as inequitable. It is not unreasonable to assume that it was with the purpose of aiding thejits civile that the first step was taken in what gradually became a momentous reform; and it is extremely probable that this first step was the announcement by some praetor that, where there was dispute as to an inheritance, and a testament was presented to him bearing not fewer seals than were required by law, lie would give possession of the goods of the defunct to the heir named in it. ^[68. In Verr. tralaticium, i.e., i.e., libripens aniestatus,] In this as it stands there is nothing but a regulation of possession of the bona of the inheritance pending the question of legal right. Just as between two parties contending about the ownership of a specific thing in a rei vindicatio the praetor first settled the question of interim possession, so did he promise to do here when a question was about to be tried about the right to an inheritance (si de hereditate ambigitur). It was a provisional arrangement merely, and very necessary in view of the state of the law which permitted a third party, apart from any pretence of title, to step in and complete a usucapio pro herede by a year’s possession of the effects of the inheritance (supra, p. 692). Even at the time when the Edict was closed it was not necessarily more than a provisional grant; for, if heirs-at-law of the deceased appeared and proved that, although the testament bore on the outside the requisite number of seals, yet in fact some solemnity of execution, such as the familiae venditio or testamenti nuncupalio, had been omitted, the grantee had to yield them up the possession that had been given him pending inquiry. It was only by a rescript of Marcus Aurelius’s that it was declared that a plea by the heir-at-law of invalidity of a testament on the ground of defect of formalities of execution might be defeated by an cxceptio doli, on the principle that it was contrary to good faith to set aside the wishes of a testator on a technical objection that was purely formal. Thus was the bonorum possessio secundum tabulas, i.e., in accordance with a testament, from being originally one in aid of thejui civile, in course of time converted into one in contradiction of it. That the motives and purposes of the series of praetors who built up the law of bonorum possessio must have varied in progress of years is obvious; and, once the machinery had been invented, nothing was easier than to apply it to new ideas. The praetor could not make a man heir,—that he always disclaimed; but he could give a man, whether heir or not, the substantial advantages of inheritance, and protect him in their enjoyment by praetorian remedies. He gave him possession of the goods of the deceased, with summary remedies for ingathering them, which, once in his hands, would become his in quiritarian right on the expiry of the period of usucapion; and, by interpolation into the formula of a fiction of heirship, he gave him effectual personal actions against debtors of the deceased, rendering him liable in the same way to the deceased’s creditors.

Another variety of the bonorum possessio was that contra tabulas, —in opposition to the terms of a testament. If a testator had neither instituted nor expressly disinherited a son who was one of his sui heredes, then his testament was a nullity, and the child passed over had no need of a praetorian remedy. Where sui heredes other than sons were passed over the jus civile allowed them to participate with the instituted heirs by a sort of accrual. But the Edict went further; for, if the institute was a stranger, i.e., not brother or sister of the child passed over, then, on the petition of the latter, the praetor gave him and any other sui concurring with him possession of the whole estate of the deceased, the institute being left with nothing more than the empty name of heir. Another application of the bonorum possessio contra tabulas was to the case of emancipated children of the testator’s. By the jus civile he was not required to institute or disinherit them; for by their emancipation they had ceased to be siri heredes, and had lost that interest in the family estate which was put forward as the reason why they had to be mentioned in the testament of their paterfamilias. The praetors—although probably not until the empire, and when the doctrines of the Jits naturalc were being more freely recognized— put them on the same footing as unemancipated children, requiring that they also should be either instituted or disinherited, and giving them bonorum possessio if they were not. It was contra tabulas in the sense that it displaced the instituted heirs either wholly or partially,—wholly when the institutes were not children of the deceased, partially when they were. In the latter case, at least when sui were affected by it, the grant of bonorum possessio was under the very equitable condition that the grantees should collate or bring into partition all their own acquisitions since their emancipation.

The third variety of bonorum possessio was that granted ab intestato. As has been shown on a previous page (p. 692), the rules of the jws civile in reference to succession on intestacy were extremely strict and artificial. They admitted neither emancipated children nor agnates who had undergone capitis deminutio ; they admitted no female agnate except a sister; if the nearest agnate or agnates declined, the right did not pass to those of the next degree; mere cognates, kinsmen of the deceased who were not agnates, e.g., grandchildren or others related to him through females and agnates capitc minuti, were not admitted at all; while a wife had no share unless she had been in manu of the deceased and therefore fliae loco. All these matters the praetors amended, and so far paved the way for the revolution in the law of intestate succession which was accomplished by Justinian.

The classes they established were four. (1) Displacing the sui heredes of the jus civile, they gave the first place to descendants (liberi), including in the term all those whom the deceased would have been bound either by the jus civile or the Edict to institute or disinherit had he made a will, i.e., his wife in manu, his natural (as distinguished from adopted) sons and daughters whether in potestate at his death or emancipated, the representatives of sons who had predeceased him, and adopted children in his potestas when he died. (2) On failure of liberi the right to petition for bonorum possessio opened to the nearest collateral agnates of the intestate, under their old name of legitimi heredes. (3) Under the jus civile, on failure of agnates (and of the gens where there was one), the succession was vacant and fell to the fisc, unless perchance it was usucapted by a stranger possessing pro herede. The frequency of such vacancies was much diminished by the recognition by the praetors of the right of cognates to claim bonorum possessio in the third place. Who they had primarily in view under the name of “cognates” it is impossible to say. The epithet is most frequently applied by modern writers to kinsmen related through females; but in its widest sense it included all kinsmen without exception, and in a more limited sense all kinsmen not entitled to claim as agnates. There were included amongst them therefore—although it is very probable that the list was not made up at once, but from time to time by the action of a series of praetors—not merely kinsmen related through females (who were not agnates), but also agnates of a remoter degree who were excluded as such because the nearest agnates in existence had declined, persons who had been agnates but by reason of capitis minutio had lost that character, female agnates more distantly related than sisters, and children of the intestate’s who at the time of his death were in an adoptive family. All these took according to proximity. (4) Finally, the claim passed to the survivor of husband and wife, assuming always that their marriage had not involved manus. This list constituted the prsetorian order of succession on intestacy.

All these bonorum possessions had to be formally petitioned for. In that ab intestato descendants were allowed a year for doing so, while other persons were limited to 100 days, the period for those entitled in the second place beginning when that of those entitled in the first had expired, and so on. The grant was always made at the risk of the petitioner; nothing was assured him by it; it might turn out real and substantial (cum re) or merely nominal (sine re), according as the grantee could or could not maintain it against the heir of the jus civile. For the latter was entitled to stand on his statutory or testamentary right, without applying for bonorum possessio, although in fact he often did so for the sake of the summary procedure it supplied him for ingathering the effects of the deceased.

The Law of Procedure.— The substitution of the formular system of procedure for that by the “actions of the law” commenced long before the end of the period now under consideration; and we have had occasion more than once to observe how greatly it facilitated the development of the institutions of property and contractual obligation. But as the change was only completed in the early empire it will be more convenient to defer explanation of the nature of the new procedure in the meantime. (See infra, p. 707 sq.)

CHAPTER IV.—THE JUS NATURALE AND MATURITY OF ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE.

{The Empire until the time of Diocletian.}

I. Characteristics and Formative Agencies of the Law during the Period. Characteristics generally and Recognition of a Jus Naturale in particular.— The first three centuries of the empire witnessed the perfection of Roman jurisprudence and the commencement of its decline. During that time the history of the law presents no such great landmarks as the enactment of the XII. Tables, the commencement of a praetor’s edict, the recognition of simple consent as creative of a contractual bond, or the introduction of a new form of judicial procedure; the establishment of a class of patented jurists speaking as the mouthpieces of the prince, and the admission of all the free subjects of the empire to the privileges of citizenship, are about the only isolated events to which one can point as productive of great and lasting results. There were, indeed, some radical changes in particular institutions, such as the caduciary legislation of Augustus, intended to raise the tone of domestic morality and increase fruitful marriages, and the legislation of the same emperor and his immediate successor for regulation of the status of enfranchised slaves; but these, although of vast importance in themselves, and the first of them influencing the current of the law for centuries, yet left upon it no permanent impression. It was by much less imposing efforts that it attained the perfection to which it reached under the sovereigns of the Severan house,—a steady advance on the lines already marked out in the latter years of the republic. The sphere of the jus Quiritium became more and more circumscribed, and one after another of the formalities of the jus civile was abandoned. The manus of the husband practically disappeared; the patria potestas of the father lost much of its significance by the recognition, notwithstanding it, of the possibility of a separate and independent estate in the child; slaves might be enfranchised by informal manumission; res mancipi constantly passed by simple tradition, the right of the transferee being secured by the Publician action; servitudes and other real rights informally constituted were maintained as effectual tuitione praetoris; an heir’s acceptance of a succession could be accomplished by any indication of his intention, without observance of the formal cretio of the earlier law; and many of the incidental bargains incident to consensual contract, but varying their natural import, that used to be embodied in words of stipulation, came to be enforcible on the strength of formless contemporaneous agreements.

The preference accorded by jurists and judges to the jus gentium, over thejws civile is insufficient to account for these and many other changes in the same direction, as well as for the ever-increasing tendency evinced to subordinate word and deed to the voluntas from which they arose. They are rather to be attributed to the striving on the part of many after a higher ideal, to which they gave the name of jus naturale. ^[69. Das Jus naturale . . . der Romer, Ancient Law,] It is sometimes said that the notion of a jus naturale as distinct from the jus gentium was peculiar to Ulpian, and that it found no acceptance with the Roman jurists generally. But this is inaccurate. Justinian, indeed, has excerpted in the Digest and put in the forefront of his Institutes a passage from an elementary work of Ulpian’s, in which he speaks of a jus naturale that is common to man and the lower animals, and which is substantially instinct. This is a law of nature of which it is quite true that we find no other jurist taking account.

But many of them refer again and again to the jus naturale-, and Gaius is the only one (Justinian following him) who occasionally makes it synonymous jus gentium. There can be no question that the latter was much more largely imbued with precepts of natural law than was the jus civile, but it is impossible to say they were identical; it is enough to cite but one illustration, pointed out again and again in the texts: while the one admitted the legality of slavery, the other denied it. While the jus civile studied the interests only of citizens, and the jus gentium those of freemen irrespective of nationality, the law of nature had theoretically a wider range and took all mankind within its purview. We have no hint that the doctrine of the jus gentium differed in this respect from the jus civile— that a slave was nothing but a chattel; yet we find the latter, -when tinctured with the jus naturale, recognizing many rights as competent to a slave, and even conceding that he might be debtor or creditor in a contract, although his obligation or claim could be given effect to only indirectly, since he could neither sue nor be sued.

Voigt thus summarizes the characteristics of this speculative Roman jus naturale :—(1) its potential universal applicability to all men, (2) among all peoples, (3) at all times, and (4) its correspondence with the innate conviction of right {innere Rechtsuber-zeugung}. ^[70. l.c.,] Its propositions, as gathered from the pages of the jurists of the period, he formulates thus :—(1) recognition of the claims of blood {sanguinis vel cognationis ratio'} ; (2) duty of faithfulness to engagements,— is natura debct . . . cujus fidem secuti sumus; (3) apportionment of advantage and disadvantage, gain and loss, according to the standard of equity; (4) supremacy of the voluntatis ratio over the words or form in which the will is manifested. ^[71.] It was regard for the first that, probably pretty early in the principate, led the prsetors to place emancipated children on a footing of perfect equality with unemancipated in the matter of succession, and to admit collateral kindred through females as well as those related through males; and that, in the reigns of Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius respectively, induced the senate to give a mother a pre ferred right of succession to her children, and vice versa. It was respect for the second that led to the recognition of the validity of what was called a natural obligation,—one that, because of some defect of form or something peculiar in the position of the parties, was ignored by the jus civile and incapable of being made the ground of an action for its enforcement, yet might be given effect to indirectly by other equitable remedies. Regard for the third was nothing new in the jurisprudence of the period; the republic had already admitted it as a principle that a man was not to be unjustifiably enriched at another’s cost; the jurists of the empire, however, gave it a wider application than before, and used it as a key to the solution of many a difficult question in the domain of the law of contract. As for the fourth, it was one that had to be applied with delicacy; for the voluntas could not in equity be preferred to its manifestation to the prejudice of other parties who in good faith had acted upon the latter. We have many evidences of the skilful way in which the matter was handled, speculative opinion being held in check by considerations of individual interest and general utility.

A remark of Voigt’s on the subject is well worthy of being kept in view, that the risk which arose from the setting up of the precepts of a speculative jus naturale, as derogating from the rules of the jus civile, was greatly diminished through the position held by the jurists of the early empire. Their jus respondendi {infra, p. 705) made them legislative organs of the state, so that, in introducing principles of the jus naturale, or of acquum et bonum, they at the same moment positivized them and gave them the force of law. They were, he says, “philosophers in the sphere of law, searchers after the ultimate truth; but, while they—usually in reference to a concrete case—sought out the truth and applied what they had found, they combined with the freedom and untrammelledness of speculation the life-freshness of practice and the power of assuring the operativeness of their abstract propositions.” ^[72.] Influence of Constitutional Changes.— The changes in the constitution aided not a little the current of the law. Men of foreign descent reached the throne and recruited the senate,—proud indeed of the history and traditions of Rome, yet in most cases free from prejudice in favour of institutions that had nothing to recommend them but their antiquity. Military life had not the same attractions as during the republic; there was no longer a tribunate to which men of ambition might aspire; the comitia soon ceased to afford an outlet for public eloquence; so that men of education and [9:20:704]position had all the more inducement to devote themselves to the conscientious study and regular practice of the law. This was fjreatly encouraged by the action of Augustus in creating a class of icensed or patented jurists, privileged to give answers to questions submitted to them by the judges, and that ex auctoritate principis, and still more so, perhaps, by Hadrian’s reorganization of the imperial privy council, wherein a large proportion of the seats were assigned to jurists of distinction. With several of the emperors lawyers were amongst their most intimate and trusted friends. Again and again the office of privtorian prefect, the highest next the throne, was filled by them; Papinian, Ulpian, and Paul all held it in the reigns of Septimius Severus and Alexander. Jurisprudence, therefore, was not merely an honourable and lucrative profession under the new arrangements, but a passport to places of eminence in the state; and till the death of Alexander the ranks of the jurists never failed to be recruited by men of position and accomplishment.

Extension of Citizenship to the Empire generally. — It must have been between the years 212 and 217 that Caracalla published his constitution conferring citizenship on all the free inhabitants of the empire. Far-reaching as were its consequences, the primary purpose was purely fiscaL Augustus had imposed a tax of five per cent, on inheritances and bequests, except where the whole succession was worth less than 100,000 sesterces or the heir or legatee was a near kinsman of the deceased. It was continued by his successors, and was very profitable, thanks to the propensity of the well-to-do classes for single blessedness, followed by testamentary distribution of their fortunes amongst their friends. But it affected only the successions of Roman citizens, so that the great mass of the provincials escaped it. Caracalla, being needy, not only increased it temporarily to ten per cent., but widened the area of its operation by elevating all his free subjects to the rank of citizens. The words of Ulpian are very inclusive,—“in urbe Romano qui sunt . . . cives Romani effecti sunt ”; but there is considerable diversity of opinion as to their meaning, caused by the fact that peregrins are still mentioned by some of Caracalla’s successors. Limit the constitution, however, as we may, there can be no question of its immense importance. By conferring citizenship on the provincial peregrins it subjected them in all their relations to the law of Rome, and qualified them for taking part in many transactions both inter vivos and mortis causa which previously had been incompetent for them. It did away with the necessity for the jus gentium as a separate positive system. Its principles and its doctrines, it is true, survived, and were expanded and elaborated as freely and successfully as ever; but they were so dealt with as part and parcel of the civil law of Rome, which had ceased to be Italian and become imperial.

Legislation of Comitia and Senate.— Augustus, clinging as much as possible to the form of republican institutions, thought it ex-

fiedient not to break with the old practice of submitting his legis-ative proposals to the vote of the comitia of the tribes. Some of them were far from insignificant. Besides various measures for the amendment of the criminal law, three groups of enactments of considerable importance owed their authorship to him, the first to improve domestic morality and encourage fruitful marriage, the second to abate the evils that had arisen from the too lavish admission of liberated slaves to the privileges of citizenship, and the third to regulate procedure in public prosecutions and private litigations.

The first group included the Lex Julia de adultcriis coercendis of

736 and the Lex Julia et Papia Poppaea,— the latter a voluminous matrimonial code, which for two or three centuries exercised such an influence as to be regarded as one of the sources of Roman law almost quite as much as the XII. Tables or Julian’s consolidated Edict. It was often spoken of as the Lex Caducaria, one of its most remarkable provisions being that unmarried persons (within certain ages and under certain qualifications) should forfeit entirely anything to which they were entitled under a testament, and that married but childless persons should forfeit one-half, the lapsed provisions (caduca') going to the other persons named in the will who were qualified in terms of the statute, and failing them to the fisc. However well intended, the language of Juvenal and others raises doubts whether the law did not really do more harm than good. By the Christian emperors many of its provisions were repealed, while others fell into disuse; and in tne Justinianian books hardly a trace is left of its distinctive features.

The second group included the zElia-Sentian law of the year 4 a.d., the Fufia-Caninian law of the year 8, and the Junia-Norban law of the year 19,—the last passed in the reign of Tiberius, but was probably planned by Augustus. The JElia-Sentian law regulated the matter of manumission, with the result that a manumittee might on that event, and according to circumstances minutely described, become (1) either a citizen, or (2) a freedman with the possibility of attaining citizenship by a process indicated in the statute, or (3) a freedman who, because of his bad character, was forbidden to reside within a hundred miles of Rome and denied the hope of ever becoming a citizen (libertus dediticius). The Junian law was passed in order to define more precisely the status in the meantime of those freedmen who had a potentiality of citizenship. It did so by assimilating them to the colonial Latins, denying to them the rights of a citizen proper so far as concerned family and succession, but conceding to them all the patrimonial rights of a citizen and the fullest power of dealing with their belongings so long as not mortis causa and to the prejudice of their patrons. This was the Junian Latinity so prominent in the pages of Gaius, but of which our limits exclude any detailed description.

The third group of enactments referred to included the two Leges Juliac judiciariae, of which we know but little. That regulating procedure in private litigations is the same that is mentioned by Gaius as having completed the work of the Aebutian law in substituting the formular system for that per legis actiones. It must have been a somewhat comprehensive statute, as a passage in the Vatican Fragments refers to a provision of its 27th section; and our ignorance of its contents therefore, beyond one or two trifling details, is the more to be regretted.

From the time of Tiberius onwards it was the senate that did the work of legislation, for the simple reason that the comitia were no longer fit for it. And very active it seems to have been. This may have been due to some extent to the fact that so many professional jurists, aware from their practice of the points in which the law required amendment, possessed seats in the imperial council, where the drafts of the senatusconsults were prepared. It was the senatusconsults that were the principal statutory factors of what was called by both emperors and jurists the jus novum,— law that departed often very widely from the principles of the old jus civile, that was much more in accordance with those of the Edict, and that to a great extent might have been introduced through its means had not the authority of the praetors been overshadowed by that of the prince. In the end of the 2d and the beginning of the 3d century the supremacy of the latter in the senate became rather too pronounced, men quoting the oratio in which he had submitted to it a project of law instead of the resolution which gave it legislative effect. No doubt it must have been carefully considered beforehand in the imperial council, and rarely stood in need of further discussion; but the ignoring of the formal act that followed it tended unduly to emphasize the share borne in it by the sovereign, and made it all the easier for the emperors after Alexander Severus to dispense altogether with the time-honoured practice.

The Consolidated Edictum Perpetuum. — The edicts of the praetors, which had attained very considerable proportions before the fall of the republic, certainly received some additions in the early empire. But those magistrates did not long enjoy the same independence as of old; there was a greater imperium than theirs in the state, before which they hesitated to lay hands on the law with the boldness of their predecessors. They continued as before to publish annually at entry on office the edicts that had been handed down to them through generations; but their own additions were soon limited to mere amendments rendered necessary by the provisions of some senatusconsult that affected the jus honorarium. They ceased to be that viva vox juris civilis which they had been in the time of Cicero; the emperor, if any one, was now entitled to the epithet; the annual edict had lost its raison d'être. Hadrian was of opinion that the time had come for writing its “explicit,” and giving it another and a more enduring and authoritative shape,— for so fashioning and so sanctioning it that it might be received as law, and not merely as edict, throughout the length and breadth of the empire. He accordingly commissioned Salvius Julianus, urban praetor at the time, to revise it, with a view to its approval by the senate as part of the statute law.

The révisai, unfortunately, like the XII. Tables, is no longer extant. It is only a very slight account we have of the revision,— a line or two in Eutropius and Aurelius Victor, and a few lines in two of Justinian’s prefaces to the Digest. We may assume, from what is said there, that there were both abridgment and rearrangement of the edicts of the urban praetor; but the question remains how far Julian consolidated with them those of the peregrin praetor and other officials who had contributed to the jus honorarium. Those of the curule aediles, we are told, were included; Justinian says that they formed the last part of Julian’s work, and may have been a sort of appendix. There is reason to believe that so much of the edicts of the provincial governors as differed from those of the praetors were also incorporated in it, and that the edicts of the peregrin praetors, in so far as they contained available matter not embodied in those of their urban colleagues or the provincial governors, were dealt with in the same way. The consolidation got the name of Edictum Perpetuum in a sense somewhat different from that formerly imputed to édicta perpétua as distinguished from edicta repentina, and, after approval by Hadrian,' seems to have been formally sanctioned by senatusconsult. It was thus a closed chapter so far as the praetors were concerned; for, though it may have continued for a time to hold its place on their album with its formularies of actions, they had no longer any power to alter or make additions to it. It liad ceased to be a mere efflux of their imperium and had become matter of statute; and its interpréta[9:20:705]tion and amendment were no longer in their hands but in those of the emperor.

The Julian Edict does not seem to have been divided into books, but only into rubricated titles; and the general impression is that the formularies of actions were split up and distributed in their appropriate places. The arrangement is not difficult to discover by comparison of the various commentaries upon it, particularly those of Ulpian and Paul, which each contained over eighty books. First came a series of titles dealing with the foundations and first steps of all legal procedure,—jurisdiction, summons, intervention of attorneys or procurators, &c.; secondly, ordinary process in virtue of the magistrate’s jurisilictio ; thirdly, extraordinary process, originally in virtue of his imperium ; fourthly, execution against judgment-debtors, bankrupts, &c.; fifthly, interdicts, exceptions, and praetorian stipulations; and lastly, the aedilian remedies. From the quotations from the Julian Edict embodied in the fragments of the writings of the commentators preserved by Justinian repeated attempts have been made to reproduce it. Most of them are nothing.more than transcripts or attempted reconstructions of passages in the Digest which are supposed to have been borrowed from it, and are of comparatively little value. The only really scientific and worthily critical efforts are those of Rudorff in 1869 and Lenel in 1883. ^[73. De jurisdictions edictum: edicti perpetwi quae reliqua sunt, Krit. Vierteljahrschrift, sq. Das Edictum Perpetuum: ein Versuch zu dessen Wiederherstellung, formulae Edict, Zeitschr. d. Sav. Stift., Röm. Abtheil., sq.] The Responses of Patented Counsel.— The right of responding under imperial authority (jms respondendi ex auctoritate principis), first granted by Augustus and continued by his successors down to the time of Alexander Severus, did not imply any curtailment of the right of unlicensed jurists to give advice to any one who chose to consult them. What it did was to give an authoritative character to a response, so that the judge who had asked for it and to whom it was presented—for the judges were but private citizens, most of them unlearned in the law—was bound to adopt it as if it had emanated from the emperor himself. It may be that Augustus was actuated by a political motive,—that he was desirous by this concession to attach lawyers of eminence to the new régime, and prevent the recurrence of the evils experienced during the republic from the too great influence of patrons. But, whatever may have prompted his action in the matter, its beneficial consequences for the law can hardly be overrated. For the quasi - legislative powers with which they were invested enabled the patented counsel to influence current doctrine not speculatively merely but positively {jura condere), and so to leaven their interpretations of the jus civile and jus honorarium with suggestions of natural law as to give a new complexion to the system.

Instead of giving his opinion like the unlicensed jurist by word of mouth, either at the request of the judge or at the instance of one of the parties, the patented counsel, who did not require to give his reasons, reduced it to writing and sent it to the court under seal. Augustus does not seem to have contemplated the possibility of conflicting responses being tendered from two or more jurists equally privileged. It was an awkward predicament for a judge to be placed in. Hadrian solved the difficulty by declaring that in such a case the judge should be entitled to use his own discretion. ^[74. Inst.,] That on receiving a response 'with which he was dissatisfied he could go on calling for others until he got one to his mind, and then pronounce judgment in accordance with it on the ground that there was difference of opinion, is extremely unlikely. The more probable explanation of Hadrian’s rescript is, that the number of patented responding counsel was very limited; that a judge, if he desired their assistance, was required by this rescript to consult them all {quorum omnium si, &c.); that, if they were unanimous, but only then, their opinion had force of statute {legis vicem optinet) ; and that when they differed the judge must decide for himself.

Constitutions of the Emperors ^[75. Dig., Röm. Staatsrecht, sq. Krit. Studien zur Theorie der Rechts-quellen im Zeitalter d. ldass. Juristen, Zeitschr. d. Sav. Stift., Röm. Abtheil., sq.; Röm. Rechtsgesch.,] Gaius and Ulpian concur in holding that every imperial constitution, whether in the shape of rescript, decree, or edict, had the force of statute. It may be that by the time of Ulpian that was the prevailing opinion; but modern criticism is disposed to regard the dictum of Gaius, written in the time of Antoninus Pius, as coloured by his Asiatic notions, and not quite accurate so far as the edicts were concerned. As supreme magistrate the emperor had the same jus cdicendi that kings, consuls, and prsetors had had before him, and used it as they did to indicate some course of action he meant to adopt and follow or some relief he proposed to grant. His range, of course, was much greater than that of the prsetors had been; for his authority endured for life, and extended over the whole empire and every department of government. But originally, and in principle, his successor on the throne was no more bound to adopt any of his edicts than a praetor was to adopt those of his predecessors. That it was not unusual for an edict to be renewed, and that it occasionally happened that the renewal was not by the immediate successor of its original author, are manifest from various passages in the texts. Very frequently, when its utility had stood the test of years, it was transmuted into a senatusconsult; this fact proves of itself that an edict per se had not the effect of statute. But their adoption by a succession of two or three sovereigns, whose reigns were of average duration, may have been held sufficient to give them the character of consuetudinary law; and, by a not unnatural process, unreflecting public opinion may have come to impute force of statute to the edict itself rather than to the longa consuetudo that followed on it, thus paving the way for the assertion by the sovereigns of the later empire of an absolute right of legislation, and for the recognition of the lex cdictalis {infra, p. 710) as the only form of statute.

The imperial rescripts and decrees {rescripta, decretal) had force of law {legis vicem habent) from the earliest days of the empire, and their operation was never limited to the lifetime of the prince from whom they had proceeded. But they were not directly acts of legislation. In both the emperor theoretically did no more than authoritatively interpret existing law, although the boundary between interpretation and new law, sometimes difficult to define, was not always strictly adhered to. The rescript was an answer by the emperor to a petition, either by an official or a private party, for an instruction as to how the law was to be applied to the facts set forth; when the answer was in a separate writing it was usually spoken of as an epistula ; when noted at the foot of the application its technical name was subscriptio or adnotatio. The decree was the emperor’s ruling in a case submitted to him judicially; it might be when it had been brought before him in the first instance extra ordinem, or when it had been removed by supplicatio from an inferior court in its earliest stage, or when it came before him by appeal. It was as a judge that the emperor pronounced his decree; but, proceeding as it did from the fountain of authoritative interpretation, it had a value far beyond that of the sentence of an inferior court (which was law only as between the parties), and formed a precedent which governed all future cases involving the same question. Those decrees and rescripts constituted one of the most important sources of the law during the first three centuries and more of the empire, and were elaborated with the assistance of the most eminent jurists of the day, the rescripts being the special charge of the magister libellorum. From the time of the Gordians to that of the abdication of Diocletian they were almost the only channel of the law that remained.

Professional Jurisprudence.— A sketch of the history of Roman law can hardly be considered complete without some account of the jurists of the first two centuries and a half of the empire, who contributed to it the great body of doctrine embalmed in the Digest of Justinian. But the exigencies of space compel us to refrain from entering upon a branch of our subject that cannot be satisfactorily treated without considerable detail, and to content ourselves with referring the reader to the recent work of Mr Roby, or the Rechts-geschichte of Professor Karlowa of Heidelberg, where all will be found that the most inquisitive could desire. ^[76. Introduction to the Study of Justinian's Digest, Rom. Rechtsgeschichte, {Stoats-recht und Rechtsquellen),] For an account of the extant remains of their writings outside the Justinianian Digest, such as the Institutes of Gaius, the Rules of Ulpian, the Sentences of Paul, and a variety of minor pieces, we must likewise refer to Karlowa’s book, ^[77. op. cit., Digest Historical Introduction to the Private Law of Rome.] which promises to be the most elaborate history of Roman law as yet given to the public.

II. Substantive Changes in the Law. Concession of Peculiar Privileges to Soldiers.— While the period with which we are dealing saw the substantial disappearance of the distinction between citizen and peregrin, it witnessed the rise of another,—that between soldiers and civilians (milites, pagani). The most remarkable effluxes [9:20:706]of the jus militare (as it is sometimes called) were the military testament and the castrense peculium. The first set at naught all the rules of the jus civile and the praetors’ edict alike as to the form and substance of last wills. It might be in writing, by word of mouth, by the unspoken signs perhaps of a dying man; all that was required was the voluntas so manifested as not to be mistaken. More extraordinary still,—it was sustained even though its provisions ran counter to the most cherished rules of the common law. Contrary to the maxim that no man could die partly testate and partly intestate, a soldier might dispose of part of his estate by testament and leave the rest to descend to his heirs ab intestato. Contrary also to the maxim semel heres semper heres, he might give his estate to A for life or for a term of years, or until the occurrence of some event, with remainder to B. Contrary to the general rule, a Latin or peregrin, or an unmarried or married but childless person, might take an inheritance or a bequest from a soldier as freely as could a citizen with children. His testament, in so far as it disposed only of bona castrensia, was not affected by capitis deminutio minima. It was not invalidated by prseterition of sui heredes, nor could they challenge it because they had less under it than their “legitim”; nor could the instituted heir claim a Fal-cidian fourth, even though nine-tenths of the succession had been assigned to legatees. Finally, a later testament did not nullify an earlier one, if it appeared to be the intention of the soldier testator that they should be read together.

All this is remarkable, manifesting a spirit very different from that which animated the common law of testaments. True, it was a principle with the jurists of the classical period that the voluntatis ratio was to be given effect to in the interpretation of testamentary writings; but that was on the condition that the requirements of law as to form and substance had been scrupulously observed. But in the military testament positive rules were made to yield to the voluntas in all respects: the will was almost absolutely unfettered. Roman law in this matter gave place to natural law. One would have expected the influence of so great a change to have manifested itself by degrees in the ordinary law of testaments; yet it is barely visible. In a few points the legislation of Constantine, Theodosius II., and Justinian relaxed the strictness of the old rules; but there was never any approach to the recognition of the complete supremacy of the voluntas. In the Corpus Juris the contrast between the testamcntum paganum and the tcstamentum militare was almost as marked as in the days of Trajan. The latter was still a privileged deed, whose use was confined to a soldier actually on service, and which had to be replaced by a testament executed according to the usual forms of law within twelve months after his retirement.

The peculium castrense had a wider influence; for it was the first of a series of amendments that vastly diminished the importance of the patria potestas on its patrimonial side. It had its origin in the concession by Augustus to filiifamilias on service of the right to dispose by testament of what they had acquired in the active exercise of their profession (quod in castris adquisierant). But it soon went much further. Confined at first to filiifamilias on actual service, the privilege was extended by Hadrian to those who had obtained honourable discharge. The same emperor allowed them not merely to test on their peculium castrense, but to manumit slaves that formed part of it; and a little step further recognized their right to dispose of it onerously or gratuitously inter vivos. By and by the range of it was extended so as to include not only the soldier’s pay and prize but all that had come to him, directly or indirectly, in connexion with his profession,—his outfit, gifts made to him during his service, legacies from comrades, and so on. All this was in a high degree subversive of the doctrines of the common law. It may almost be called revolutionary; for it involved in the first place the recognition of the right of a person alicni juris to make a testament as if he were swi juris, and in the second place the recognition of a separate estate in a filiicsfami-lias which he might deal with independently of his paterfamilias, which could not be touched by the latter’s creditors, and which he was not bound to collate (or bring into hotch-pot) on claiming a share of his father’s succession. The radical right of the parent, however, was rather suspended than extinguished; for, if the soldier son died intestate, the right of the paterfamilias revived: he took his son’s belongings, not as his heir appropriating an in heritance, but as his paterfamilias reclaiming a peculium. ^[78. Novel, infra,] The Family.— The legislative efforts of Augustus to encourage marriage, to which persons of position showed a remarkable distaste, have already been mentioned. The relation of husband and wife still in law required no more for its creation than deliberate interchange of nuptial consent, although for one or two purposes the bride’s home-coming to her husband’s house was regarded as the criterion of completed marriage. But it was rarely accompanied with manus. So repugnant was such subjection to patrician ladies that they declined to submit to confarreate nuptials; and so great consequently became the difficulty of finding persons qualified by confarreate birth to fill the higher priesthoods that early in the empire it had to be decreed that confarreation should in future be productive of manus only quoad sacra, and should not make the wife a member of her husband’s family. Manus by a year’s uninterrupted cohabitation was already out of date in the time of Gaius; and, although that by coemption was still in use in his time, it probably was quite unknown by the end of the period. Husband and wife therefore had their separate estates, the common establishment being maintained by the husband, with the assistance of the revenue of the wife’s dowry (dos),— an institution which received much attention at the hands of the jurists, and was to some extent regulated by statute. Divorce was unfortunately very common; it was lawful even without any assignable cause; when blame attached to either side, he or she suffered deprivation to some extent of the nuptial provisions, but there were no other penal consequences.

Not only in the case of a filiusfamilias who had adopted a military career, but in all directions, there was manifested a tendency to place restrictions on the exercise of the patria potestas. This was due in a great degree to the hold that the doctrines of natural law were gaining within the Roman system, partly also to the fact that the emperors, having succeeded to the censorial regimen morum, allowed it freely to influence their edicts and rescripts. Exposure of an infant was still allowed; but a parent was no longer permitted, even in the character of household judge, to put his son to death; in fact his prerogative was limited to moderate chastisement, the law requiring, in case of a grave offence that merited severer punishment, that he should hand his child over to the ordinary tribunal. His right of sale, in like manner, was restricted to young children, and permitted only when he was in great poverty and unable to maintain them, while their impignora-tion by him was prohibited under pain of banishment.

Except in the solitary case of a. son who was a soldier, a jmler-familias was still recognized as in law the owner of all the earnings and other acquisitions of his children in potestate ; but the old rule still remained that for their civil debts he was not liable beyond the amount of the fund he had advanced them to deal with as de facto their own (peculium profecticium), except when he had derived advantage from their contract or had expressly or by implication authorized them to enter into it as his agents. To the party with whom he had contracted a filiusfamilias was himself liable as fully as if he had been a paterfamilias, with one exception, namely, when his debt was for borrowed money; in that case, with some very reasonable qualifications, it was declared by the notorious Macedonian senatusconsult (of the time of Vespasian) that the lender should not be entitled to recover payment, even after his borrower had become sui juris by his father’s death. Between a father and his emancipated son there was, and always had been, perfect freedom of contract; but so was there now between a father and his soldier son in any matter relating to the peculium castrense, even though the son was in potestate. What is still more remarkable is that the new sentiment which was operating on the jus civile admitted the possibility of natural obligation between paterfamilias and filiusfamilias even in reference to the peculium profecticium, which, though incapable of direct enforcement by action, was yet to some extent recognized and given effect to indirectly.

In the matter of guardianship, while the tutory of pupils was carefully tended and the law in regard to it materially amended during the period under review (particularly by a senatusconsult generally referred to as the Oratio divi Sevcri, prohibiting alienation of the ward’s property without judicial authority), that of women above the age of pupilarity gradually disappeared. The guardianship or curatory (cura) of minors above pupilarity owed its institution to Marcus Aurelius. The Plsetorian law of the middle of the sixth century of the city had indeed imposed penalties on those taking undue advantage of the inexperience of minors, i.e., persons sui juris under the age of twenty-five; and from that time the praetors were in the habit of appointing curators to act with such persons for the protection of their interests in particular affairs. But it was Marcus Aurelius who first made curatory a general permanent office, to endure in the ordinary case until the ward attained majority. The powers, duties, and responsibilities of such curators became a matter for careful and elaborate definition and regulation by the jurists, whose exposition of the law of guardianship, whether by tutors or curators, has found wide acceptance in modern systems of jurisprudence.

The Law of Succession and particularly Testamentary Trusts.— There were far more positive changes in the law of succession than [9:20:707]in either that of property or that of obligation. The rise and progress of the military testament has already been explained. The testament of the common law was still ostensibly that per aes et libram ; but the practice of granting bonorum possessio secundum tabulas to the persons named as heirs in any testamentary instrument that bore outside the requisite number of seals led, from the time of Marcus Aurelius, to the frequent neglect of the time-honoured formalities of the familiae mandpatio and nuncupatio testamenti. It was a rescript of his, declaring that an heir-at-law should no longer be entitled to dispute the last wishes of a testator on the technical ground of non-compliance with the purely formal requirements of the law, that practically introduced what Justinian calls the praetorian testament.

One of the commonest provisions in the testaments of the period was the fideicommissum,— a request by the testator to his heir to enter to the inheritance and thereafter denude wholly or partially in favour of a third party. It was introduced in the time of Augustus by (it is said) a testator who had married a peregrin wife, and desired thus indirectly to give to his peregrin children the succession which, as not being citizens, they could neither take ab intestato nor as his direct testamentary heirs. ^[79. jus civile bonorum possessio testamenti factio] The practice soon gained ground, and became thoroughly established once the emperor, shocked at the perfidy of a trustee who had failed to comply with the request of his testator, indicated his approval of the new institution by remitting the matter to the consuls of the day, with instructions to do in the circumstances what they thought just. So quickly did it establish itself in public favour, and so numerous did the questions become as to the construction and fulfilment of testamentary trusts, that before long it was found necessary to institute a court specially charged with their determination, —that of the praetor fideicommissarius.

The employment of a trust as a means of benefiting those who were under disqualifications as heirs or legatees, as, for example, persons who had no testamenti factio, women incapacitated by the Voconian law, unmarried and married but childless persons incapacitated by the Julian and Papia-Poppsean law, and so on, was in time prohibited by statute; but that did not affect its general popularity. For, whether what was contemplated was a transfer of the universal hereditas or a part of it to the beneficiary {fideicommissum hereditatis), or only of some particular thing {fideicommissum rei singula r is), a testamentary trust had various advantages over either a direct institution or a direct bequest {legatum). In theory the imposition upon the heir of a trust in favour of a beneficiary, whether it required him to denude of the whole or only a part of the inheritance, did not deprive him of his character of heir or relieve him of the responsibilities of the position; and at common law therefore he was entitled to decline the succession, often to the great prejudice of the beneficiary. In order to avoid such a mischance, and at the same time to regulate their relations inter se and towards debtors and creditors of the testator’s, it became the practice for the parties to enter into stipulatory arrangements about the matter; but these were to some extent rendered superfluous by two senatusconsults, the Trebellian in the time of Nero and the Pegasian in that of Vespasian, which at once secured the beneficiary against the trustee’s {i.e., the heir’s) repudiation of the inheritance, protected the latter from all risk of loss where he was trustee and nothing more, and enabled the former to treat directly with debtors and creditors of the testator’s and himself ingather the corporeal items of the inheritance.

It was one of the advantages of a trust-bequest, whether universal or singular, that it might be conferred in a codicil, even though unconfirmed by any relative testament. The codicil {codiciUi), also an invention of the time of Augustus, was a deed of a very simple nature. It was inappropriate either for disherison of sui or institution of an heir; but if confirmed by testament it might contain direct bequests, manumissions, nominations of tutors, and the like, and whether confirmed or unconfirmed might, as stated, be utilized as a vehicle for trust-gifts. Latterly it was held operative even in the absence of a testament, the trusts contained in it being regarded as burdens on the heir-at-law.

The most important changes in the law of intestate succession during the period were those accomplished by the Tertullian and Orphitian senatusconsults, fruits of that respect for the precepts of natural law which in so many directions was modifying the doctrines of the pis civile. The first was passed in the reign of Hadrian, the second in the year 178, under Marcus Aurelius. Down to the time of the Tertullian senatusconsult a mother and her child by a marriage that was unaccompanied with manus stood related to each other only as cognates, being in law members of different families; consequently their chance of succession to each other was remote, being postponed to that of their respective agnates to the sixth or seventh degree. The purpose of the senatusconsult was to prefer a mother to all agnates of her deceased child except father and brother and sister; father and brother excluded her; but with a sister of the deceased, and in the absence of father or brother, she shared equally. While there can be little doubt that it was natural considerations that dictated this amendment, yet its authors were too timid to justify it on the abstract principle of common humanity, lest thereby they should seem to impugn the wisdom of thejus civile, and so they confined its application to women who had thejus liber-orum, i.e., to women of free birth who were mothers of three children and freedwomen who were mothers of four, thus making it ostensibly a reward of fertility. The Orphitian senatusconsult was the counterpart of the Tertullian. It gave children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, a right of succession to their mother in preference to all her agnates; and subsequent constitutions extended the principle, admitting children to the inheritance not only of their maternal grandparents but also to that of their paternal grandmother.

III. Judicial Procedure.

The Formular System ^[80. Gesch. d. rom. Rechts,] The ordinary procedure of the first three centuries of the empire was still two-staged; it commenced before the prsetor {in jure) and was concluded before a judex {in judicio). But the legis actiones had given place to praetorian formulae. Under the older system parties, and particularly the plaintiff, had themselves to formulate in statutory or traditional words of style the matter in controversy between them; and as they formulated, so did it go for trial to centumviral court or judex or arbiters, with the not infrequent result that it was then all too late discovered that the real point in the case had been missed. Under the formular system parties were free to represent their plaint and defence to the praetor in any words they pleased, the plaintiff asking for a formula and usually indicating the style on the album that he thought would suit his purpose, and the defendant demanding when necessary an exception, i.e., a plea in defence, either praetorian or statutory, that, without traversing the facts or law of the plaintiffs case, avoided his demand on grounds of equity or public policy. It was for the praetor to consider and determine whether the action or exception should or should not be granted, and, if granted, whether it should be according to the style exhibited on the album or according to a modification of it. The result he embodied in a written and signed appointment to a judge, whom he instructed what he had to try, and empowered to pronounce a finding either condemning or acquitting the defendant. This writing was the formula.

Although it was not until the early empire that this system of procedure attained its full development, yet it had its commencement two centuries before the fall of the republic. Gaius ascribes its introduction and definitive establishment to the Lex Aebutia (probably of the second decade of the sixth century of the city) and two judiciary laws of the time of Augustus {supra, pp. 696, 704). The JEbutian law, of which unfortunately w r e know very little, is generally supposed to have empowered the praetors (1) to devise a simpler form of procedure for causes already cognizable per legis actionem, (2) to devise forms of action to meet cases not cognizable under the older system, and (3) themselves to formulate the issue and reduce it to writing. It was by no means so radical a change as is sometimes supposed. There were formulae employed by the praetor both in the procedure per judicis postulationem and in that p>er condictionem. The difference between them and the formulae of the jEbutian system was that the former were in part mere echoes of the statutory words of style uttered by the plaintiff, and that they were not written but spoken in the hearing of witnesses.

A large proportion of the personal actions of the formular system were evolved out of the legis actio per condictionem. The sequence of operations may have been something like this. Taking the simplest form of it, the action for certa pecunia under the Silian law, the first step was to drop the formal condictio from which it derived its character of legis actio, thus avoiding a delay of thirty days; the plaintiff stated his demand in informal words, and, if the defendant denied indebtedness, the prsetor straightway formulated a written appointment of and instruction to a judge, embodying in it the issue in terms substantially the same as those he would have employed under the earlier procedure:—“Titius be judge. Should it appear that N. N. ought to pay {dare oportere) 50,000 sesterces to A. A., in that sum condemn N. N. to A. A. ^[81.] should it not so appear, acquit him.” This was no longer the legis actio per condictionem, because what had made it legis actio was gone, but the certi condictio of the formular system. The condictio triti-caria of the same system ran on the same lines: “Titius be judge. Should it appear that N. N. ought to give A. A. the slave Stichus, then, whatever be the value of the slave, in that condemn N. N. to A. A.,” and so on. In both of these examples the formula included only two of the four clauses that might find place in it ^[82. Aemonstratio, intentio, adjudicatio, condemnatio, & formula praescriptio]
[9:20:708]

tention” and a “condemnation.” The matter of claim in both cases was certain,—so much money in one, a slave in the other; but, while in the first the condemnation also was certain, in the second it was uncertain. What if the claim also was uncertain,— say a share of the profits of a joint adventure assured by stipulation? It was quite competent for the plaintiff to condescend on a definite sum, and claim that as due to him; but it was very hazardous, for unless he was able to prove the debt to the last sesterce he got nothing. To obviate the risk of such failure the pnetors devised the incerti condictio, whose formula commenced with a “demonstration” or indication of the cause of action, and whose “intention” referred to it and was conceived indefinitely: “Titius be judge. Whereas A. A. stipulated with N. N. for a share of the profits of a joint adventure, whatever in respect thereof N. N. ought to give to or do for (¿arc faxere oportef) A. A., in the money amount thereof condemn N. N.,” and so on. ^[83. actio ex stipulatu, condictio incerti. mutuum, incerti condictiones] Once this point was attained further progress was comparatively easy, the way being open for the construction of formulae upon illiquid claims arising from transactions in which the practice of stipulation gradually dropped out of use (supra, p. 701), till at last the bonae fidei judicia were reached, marked by the presence in the “intention” of the words ex fide bona,— “whatever in respect thereof N. N. ought in good faith to give to or do for A. A."

In the case of real actions the transition from the legis actiones i to the formulae followed a different course. The ALbutian law did not abolish the procedure per sacramentum when reference was to be to the centumviral court on a question of quiritarian right. In the time of Cicero that court was apparently still in full activity (p. 678), but by that of Gaius it is doubtful if it was resorted to except for trial of questions of inheritance. In his time questions of property were raised either per sponsionem or per formulam petitoriam. The procedure by sponsion must be regarded as the bridge between the sacramental process and the petitory vindicatio. In the first as in the second the question of real right was determined only indirectly. The plaintiff required the defendant to give him his stipulatory promise to pay a nominal sum of twenty-five sesterces in the event of the thing in dispute being found to belong to the former; and at the same time the defendant gave security for its transfer to the plaintiff, with all fruits and profits, in the same event. The formula that was adjusted and remitted to a judge ex facie raised only the simple question whether the twenty-five sesterces were due or not: the action was in form a personal, not a real one, and was therefore appropriately remitted to a single judex instead of to the centumviral tribunal. But judgment on it could be reached only through means of a finding (sentential on the question of real right; if it was for the plaintiff he did not claim the amount of the sponsion, but the thing which had been found to be his; and, if the defendant delayed to deliver it, with its fruits and profits, the plaintiff had recourse against the latter’s sureties. The petitory formula was undoubtedly of later introduction and much more straightforward. Like the certi condictio it contained only “intention” and “condemnation.” It ran thus: “Titius be judge. Should it appear that the slave Stichus, about whom this action has been raised, belongs to A. A. in quiritary right, then, unless the slave be restored, whatever be his value, in that you will condemn N. N. to A. A.; should it not so appear, you will acquit him.” s The formulae given above, whether applicable to real or personal actions, are so many illustrations of the class known as formulae juris dvilis or in jus conceptae. The characteristic of such a formula was that it contained in the “intention” one or other of the following phrases— ejus esse ex jure Quiritium, adjudicari oportere ^[84. i.e.,] 2 dari oportere, tiari fieri oportere, or damnum deddi oportere. ^[85.] Such a formula was employed where the right to be vindicated or the obligation to be enforced had its sanction in the jus civile, whether in the shape of statute, consuetude, or interpretation. Where, on the other hand, the right or obligation had its sanction solely from the praetor’s edict, formulae so conceived were inappropriate and incompetent. The actions employed in such cases were actiones juris honorarii, and these either actiones utiles or actiones in factum. The first were adaptations of actions of the jus dvile to cases that did not properly fall within them; the second were actions entirely of praetorian devising, for the protection of rights or redress of wrongs unknown to the jus civile. ^[86.]

Of the actiones utiles some were called actiones ficticiac. Resort. to a fiction is sometimes said to be a confession of weakness, and 1 adversely criticized accordingly. But every amendment on the law is an admission of defect in what is being amended; and it was in sympathy with the spirit of Roman jurisprudence, when it found an action too narrow in its definition, to include some new case that ought to fall within it, rather by feigning that the new case was the same as the old, to bring it within the scope of the existing and familiar action, than to cause disturbance by either altering the definition of the latter or introducing an entirely new remedy. A bonorum possessor (supra, p. 702) held a position unknown to the jus civile ; he was not an heir, and therefore not entitled offhand to employ the actions competent to an heir, either for recovering the property of the defunct or proceeding against his debtors. The praetor could have had no difficulty in devising new actions to meet his case; but he preferred the simpler expedient of adapting to it an heir’s actions, by introducing into the formula a fiction of civil heirship; so he did with the bonorum emptor or purchaser of a bankrupt’s estate at the sale of it in mass by his creditors. Emptio bonorum was a purely praetorian institution, and the praetor, if he had thought fit, could easily have fortified the purchaser’s acquisition by giving him praetorian remedies for recovering the property and suing the debtors of the bankrupt; but here again he followed the simpler course of giving him, as if he were a universal successor, the benefit of an heir’s actions by help of a fiction of heirship. ^[87. (Par. Inst., bonorum emptor ¡rpaiTiopios StaSoxos] A peregrin could not sue or be sued for theft or culpable damage to property, for the XII. Tables and the Aquilian law applied only to citizens; but he could both sue and be sued under cover of a fiction of citizenship. A man who had acquired a res mandpi on a good title, but without taking a conveyance by mancipation or surrender in court, if he was dispossessed before he had completed his usucapion, could not sue a rei vindicatio for its recovery, for he was not in a position to affirm that he was quiritarian owner; neither, for the same reason, could a man who in good faith and on a sufficient title had acquired a thing from one who was not in a position to alienate it. But in both cases the praetor granted him what was in effect a rei vindicatio proceeding on a fiction of completed usucapion,—the Publician action referred to on p. 699.

These are examples of actiones ficticiae,— actions of the jus dvile adapted by this very simple expedient to cases to which otherwise they would have been inapplicable, and forming one of the most important varieties of the actiones utiles. Quite different was the course of procedure in the actiones in factum, whose number i and varieties were practically unlimited, although for the most part granted in pursuance of the praetor’s promise in the edict that under such and such circumstances he would make a remit to a judex (judicium dabo) ^[88. (Dig., (Dig., (Dig., (Dig.,] and formulated in accordance with the relative skeleton styles also published on the album. A great number of them came to be known by special names, as, for example, the actio de dolo, actio negotiorum gestorum, actio hypothecaria, actio depecunia constituta, actio vi bonorum raptorum, actio de superficie, &c.,—the generic name actio in factum being usually confined to the innominate ones. Their formulae, unlike those in jus conceptae, submitted no question of legal right for the consideration of the judge, but only a question of fact, proof of which was to be followed by a condemnation. That of the actio de dolo, for example, ran thus: “Titius be judge. Should it appear that, through the fraud of N. N., A. A. was induced to convey and cede possession to him of his farm (describing it), then, unless on your order N. N. restores it, you will condemn him in damages to A. A.; if it shall not so appear, you will acquit him.”

Our limits do not admit of any explanation of the purpose, form, or effect of the prescriptions, exceptions, replications, &c., that were engrafted on a formula when required; or of the ways in which the “condemnation” was occasionally “taxed” by the praetor, so as to prevent the award of extravagant damages; or of the consequences of defects in the formula ; or of the procedure in jure before it was adjusted, or in judicio afterwards; or of appeal for review of the judgment by a higher tribunal; or of execution (which was against the estate of the judgment-debtor, and took the form of incarceration only when his goods could not be attached). Our main object has been to show how elastic was this procedure, and how the praetorian formulae, in conjunction with the relative announcements in the edict, supplied the vehicle for the introduction into the law of an immense amount of new doctrine. The system w'as fully developed before Julian’s consolidation of the praetorian remedy for the same wrong; for Gaius observes (iv. 45) that in commodate and deposit failure of the borrower or depositary to return the thing lent to or deposited -with him gave rise to actions that might be formulated either in jus or in factum.

Edict ; and the statutory recognition which the latter then obtained did nothing to impair its efficiency.

Procedure extra Ordinem ^[89. Gesch. d. röm. Rechts,] —The two-staged procedure, first in jure and then in judicio, constituted the ordo judicioruin priva-torum. Early in the empire, however, it became the practice in certain cases to abstain from adjusting a formula and making a remit to a judex, and to leave the cause in the hands of the magistrate from beginning to end. This course was adopted sometimes because the claim that was being made rested rather on moral than on legal right, and sometimes in order to avoid unnecessary disclosure of family misunderstandings. Thus, the earliest questions that were raised about testamentary trusts were sent for consideration and disposal to the consuls, apparently because, in the existing state of jurisprudence, it was thought incompetent for a beneficiary to maintain in reference to the heir (who had only been requested to comply with the testator’s wishes) that he was bound in law (dare oportere) to pay him his bequest. Had the difficulty arisen at an earlier period, and in the heyday of the constructive energy of the praetors, they would probably have solved it with an actio in factum. As it was, it fell to the emperors to deal with it, and they adopted the method of extraordinaria cognitio, the jurisdiction which they in the first instance conferred on the consuls being before long confided to a magistrate specially designated for it,— the praetor fideicommissarius. Questions between tutors and their pupil wards in like manner began to be dealt with extra ordinem, the cognition being entrusted by Marcus Aurelius to a praetor tute-laris ; while fiscal questions in which a private party was interested went to a. praetor fisci, whose creation was due to Nerva. Claims for aliment between parent and child or patron and freedman rested on natural duty rather than on legal right; they could not therefore well be made the subject-matter of a judicium, and consequently went for disposal to the consuls or the city prefect, and in the provinces to the governor. Questions of status, especially of freedom or slavery, at least from the time of Marcus Aurelius, were also disposed of extra ordinem ; and so were claims by physicians, advocates, and public teachers for their honoraria, and by officials for their salaries, the Romans refusing to admit that these could be recovered by an ordinary action of location. In all those extraordinary cognitions the procedure began with a complaint addressed to the magistrate, instead of an in jus vocatio of the party complained against; it was for the magistrate to require the attendance of the latter (evocatio) if he thought the complaint relevant. The decision was a judicatura or decretum according to circumstances.

Jural Remedies flowing directly from the Magistrate's Imperium. ^[90.] —Great as were the results for the law of the multiplication and simplification of judicia through the formular system, it may be questioned whether it did not benefit quite as much from the direct intervention of the praetors in certain cases in virtue of the supreme power with which they were invested. This manifested itself principally in the form of (1) interdicts; (2) praetorian stipulations; (3) missio in possessionem ; and (4) in integrum restitutio.

1. The interdicts ^[91. Das Inter-diktenverfahren d. Röm. in geschichtl. Entwickelung, Theorie des interdits en droit romain,] have already been referred to as in use under the regime of the jus civile ; but their number and scope were vastly increased under that of the jus praetorium. The characteristic of the procedure by interdict was this,—that in it the praetor reversed the ordinary course of things, and, instead of waiting for an inquiry into the facts alleged by a complainer, provisionally assumed them to be true and pronounced an order upon the respondent, which he was bound either to obey or show to be unjustified. The order pronounced might be either restitutory, exhibitory (in both cases usually spoken of in the texts as a decree), or prohibitory:—restitutory, when, for example, the respondent was ordained to restore something he was alleged to have taken possession of by violent means, to remove impediments he had placed in the channel of a river, and so on; exhibitory, when he was ordained to produce something he was unwarrantably detaining, e.g., the body of a freeman he was holding as his slave, or a will in which the complainer alleged that he had an interest; prohibitory, as, for example, that he should not disturb the status quo of possession as between the complainer and himself, that he should not interfere with a highway, a watercourse, the access to a sepulchre, and so forth. If the respondent obeyed the order pronounced in a restitutory or exhibitory decree, there was an end of the matter. But frequently, and perhaps more often than not, the interdict was only the commencement of a litigation, facilitated by sponsions and restipulations, in which the questions had to be tried (1) whether the interdict or injunction was justified, (2) -whether there had been breach of it, and, (3) if so, what damages were due in consequence. The procedure therefore was often anything but summary.

In the possessory interdicts uti possidetis and utrubi in particular it was extremely involved, due to some extent to the fact that they were double interdicts (interdicta duplicia), i.e., addressed indifferently to both parties. Gaius says, but, as most jurists think, erroneously, that they had been devised as ancillary to a litigation about ownership, and for the purpose of deciding which of the parties, as possessor, was to have the advantage of standing on the defensive in the rei vindicatio. ^[92. rei vindicatio per sacramentum] That they were so used in his time, as in that of Justinian, cannot be doubted. But it is amazing that they should have been, for they were infinitely more cumbrous than the vindicatio to which they led up. Take the interdict uti possidetis, which applied to immovables, as utrubi did to movables. Both parties being present, the prsetor addressed them to this effect: “I forbid that one of you two who does not possess the house in question to use force in order to prevent the other who is in possession, provided he is so neither by clandestine or violent exclusion of the first, nor in virtue of a grant from him during pleasure, from continuing to possess as at present.” It is manifest that this decided nothing; it was no more than a prohibition of disturbance of the status quo ; it left the question entirely open which of the parties it was that was in possession, and which that was forbidden to interfere. The manner of its explication was somewhat singular. Each of the parties was bound at once to commit what in the case of one of them must have been a breach of the interdict, by a pretence of violence offered to the other (vis ex conventu) ^[93. vis moribus facta Pro Caec.,] each of them was thus in a position to say to the other —“We have both used force; but it was you alone that did it in defiance of the interdict, for it is I that am in possession.” The interim enjoyment of the fruits was then awarded to the highest bidder, who gave his stipulatory promise to pay for them to his adversary in the event of the latter being successful in the long run; penal sponsions and restipulations were exchanged upon the question which of them had committed a breach of the interdict; and on these, four in number, formulae were adjusted and sent to a judex for trial. If the procedure could not thus be explicated, because either of the parties declined to take part in the vis ex conventu, or the bidding, or the sponsions and restipulations, he was assumed to be in the wrong, and, by what was called a secondary interdict, required to abstain from disturbing the other “in all time coming.” Whatever we may think of the action system of the Romans in the period of the classical jurisprudence, one cannot help standing aghast at a procedure so cumbrous and complex as that of their possessory interdicts.

2. A praetorian stipulation ^[94. Geber die prätorischen Judicial-Stipulationen,] was a stipulatory engagement imposed upon a man by a magistrate or judge, in order to secure a third party from the chance of loss or prejudice through some act or omission either of him from whom the engagement was exacted or of some other person for whom he was responsible. Although called praetorian, because the cases in which such stipulations were exigible were set forth in the Edict, there can be no question that they originated in the jus civile ; in fact they were just a means of assuring to a man in advance the benefit of an action of the jus civile whereby he might obtain reparation for any injury suffered by him through the occurrence of the act or omission contemplated as possible. Ulpian classifies them as cautionary (cauti anales), judicial, and common. The first were purely precautionary, and quite independent of any action already in dependence between the party moving the magistrate to exact the stipulation and him on whom it was desired to impose it. There were many varieties of them, connected with all branches of the law,— for example, the cautio damni infecti, security against damage to a man’s property in consequence, say, of the ruinous condition of his neighbour’s house, the cautio usufructuaria that property usufructed should revert unimpaired to the owner on the expiry of the usufructuary’s life interest, the sedilian stipulation against faults in a thing sold, and so forth. In all these cases the stipulation or cautio was a guarantee against future loss or injury, usually corroborated by sureties, and made effectual by an action on the stipulation in the event of loss or injury resulting. J udicial stipulations, according to Ulpian’s classification, were those imposed by a judge in the course of and with reference to an action in dependence before him, as, for example, the cautio judicatum solvi (that the defendant would satisfy the judgment), the cautio de dolo (that a thing claimed in the action would not be fraudulently impaired in the meantime), and many others. Common were such as might either be imposed by a magistrate apart from any depending action or by a judge in the course of one, such as that taken from a guardian for the faithful administration of his office, or from a procurator that his principal would ratify what he did.

3. Missio in possessionem was the putting of a person in possession [9:20:710]either of the whole estate of another (missio in bona) or of some particular thing belonging to him (missio in rem). The former was by far the more important. It was resorted to as a means of execution not only against a judgment-debtor but also against a man who fraudulently kept out of the way and thus avoided summons in an action, or who, having been duly summoned, would not do what was expected on the part of a defendant ', against the estate of a person deceased to which no heir would enter, thus leaving creditors without a debtor from whom they could enforce payment of their claims; and also against the estate that had belonged to a person who had undergone capitis deminutio, if the family head to whom he had subjected himself refused to be responsible for his debts. Missio in rem was granted, e.g., where a man refused to give eautio damni infecti ; the applicant was then put in possession of the ruinous property for his own protection.

4. In integrum restitutio ^[95. System d. rom. Hechts,] reinstatement of an individual, on grounds of equity, in the position he had occupied before some occurrence which had resulted to his prejudice, was one of the most remarkable manifestations of the exercise of the imperium. It was not that the individual in question, either directly by action or indirectly by exception, obtained a judgment that either rendered what had happened comparatively harmless or gave him compensation in damages for the loss he had sustained from it, but that the magistrate—and it could only be the praetor, the urban or praetorian prefect, a provincial governor, or the emperor himself—at his own hand pronounced a decree that as far as possible restored the status quo ante. It was not enough, however, to entitle a man to this extraordinary relief, that he was able to show that he had been taken advantage of to his hurt, and that no other adequate means of redress was open to him; he required in addition to be able to found on some subjective ground of restitution, such as minority, or, if he was of full age, intimidation which could not be resisted, mistake of fact, fraud, absence, or the like. What should be held to amount to a sufficient ground of restitution, either objective or subjective, was at first left very much to the discretion of the magistrate; but even here practice and jurisprudence in time fixed the lines within which he. ought to confine himself, and made the principles of in integrum restitutio as well settled almost as those of the actio quod metus cattsa or the actio de dolo.

CHAPTER V.—THE PERIOD OF CODIFICATION.

(Diocletian to Justinian.}

I. Historical Events that influenced the Law. Supremacy of the Emperors as Sole Legislators.— From the time of Diocletian downwards the making of the law was exclusively in the hands of the emperors. The senate still existed, but shorn of all its old functions alike of government and legislation. The responses of patented jurists were a thing of the past. It was to the imperial consistory alone that men looked for interpretation of old law or promulgation of new.

In the reign of Diocletian rescripts were still abundant; but the constitutions in the Theodosian and Justinianian Codes from the time of Constantine downwards are mostly of a wider scope, and of the class known as general or edictal laws (leges generates edictales). It would be wrong, however, to infer that rescripts had ceased; for Justinian’s Code contains various regulations as to their form, and the matter is dealt with again in one of his Novels. The reason why so few are preserved is that they were no longer authoritative except for the parties to whom they were addressed. This was expressly declared by the emperors Arcadius and Honorius in 398 in reference to those in answer to applications for advice from officials; and it is not unreasonable to assume that a limitation of the same sort had been put at an earlier date on the authority of those addressed to private parties. Puchta is of opinion that the enactment of Honorius and Arcadius applied equally to decreta, for the reason that during this period matters of litigation did not come under the cognizance of the emperors except on appeal, and that under the new arrangements of Constantine the judgment of affirmance or reversal was embodied in a rescript addressed to the magistrate from whom the appeal had been taken. The rule of Arcadius and Honorius was renewed in 425 by Theodosius and Valentinian, who qualified it, however, to this extent,— that, if it contained any distinct indication that the doctrine it laid down was meant to be of general application, then it was to be received as an edict or lex generalis. To this Justinian adhered in so far as rescripts in the old sense of the word were concerned; but he declared that his judgments (decreta) should be received everywhere as laws of general application, and so should any interpretation given by him of a lex generalis, even though elicited by the petition of a private party. The imperial edicts, adjusted in the consistory, were usually addressed to the people, the senate, or some official, civil, military, or ecclesiastical, according to the nature of their subject-matter.

Establishment of Christianity as the State Religion ^[96. De l'influence du christianisme sur le droit civil des Romains, The Conversion of the Roman Empire] 2 — A disposition has sometimes been manifested to credit nascent Christianity with the humaner spirit which began to operate on some of the institutions of the law in the first century of the empire, but which in a previous section we have ascribed to the infiltration into the jus civile of doctrines of thejwa naturale, the product of the philosophy of the Stoa. The teaching of Seneca did quite as much— nay far more—to influence it then than the lessons that were taught in the little assemblies of the early converts. It would be a bold thing to say that, had Christianity never gained its predominance, that spirit of natural right would not have continued to animate the course of legislation, and to evoke, as years progressed, most of those amendments in the law of the family and the law of succession that were amongst the most valuable contributions of the imperial constitutions to the private law. It may well be that that spirit was intensified and rendered more active with the growth of Christian belief; but not until the latter had been publicly sanctioned by Constantine, and by Theodosius declared to be the religion of the state, do we meet with incontestable records of its influence. We find them in enactments in favour of the church and its property, and of its privileges as a legatee; in those conferring or imposing on the bishops a supervision of charities and charitable institutions, and a power of interfering in matters of guardianship; in the recognition of the efficacy of certain acts done in presence of two or three of the clergy and thereafter recorded in the church registers; in the disabilities as to marriage and succession with which heretics and apostates were visited, and in a variety of minor matters. Of greater importance were three features for which it was directly responsible,—the repeal of the caduciary provisions of the Papia-Poppsean law, the penalties imposed upon divorce, and the institution of the episcopalis audientia.

The purpose of the caduciary law was to discourage celibacy and encourage fruitful marriages; but legislation in such a spirit could not possibly be maintained when celibacy had come to be inculcated as a virtue, and as the peculiar characteristic of a holy life. The penalties alike of orbitas and coelibatus were abolished by Constantine in the year 320. The legislation about divorce, from the first of Constantine’s enactments on the subject down to those of Justinian, forms a miserable chapter in the history of the law. Not one of the emperors who busied himself with the matter, undoing the work of his predecessors and substituting legislation of his own quite as complicated and futile, thought of interfering with the old principle that divorce ought to be as free as marriage and independent of the sanction or decree of a judicial tribunal. Justinian was the first who, by one of his Novels, imposed a condition on parties to a divorce of common accord (communi consensu), namely, that they should both enter a convent, otherwise it should be null; but, so distasteful was this to popular feeling, and so little conducive to improvement of the tone of morals within the conventual precincts, that it was repealed by his successor. The legislation of Justinian’s predecessors and the bulk of his own were levelled at one-sided repudiations, imposing penalties, personal and patrimonial (1) upon the author of a repudiation on some ground the law did not recognize as sufficient—and the lawful grounds varied from reign to reign —and (2) upon the party whose misconduct gave rise to a repudiation that was justifiable. The bishop’s court (episcopate judicium, episcopalis audientia) had its origin in the practice of the primitive Christians, in accordance with the apostolic precept, of submitting their differences to one or two of their brethren in the faith, usually a presbyter or bishop, who acted as arbiter. On the establishment of Christianity the practice obtained legislative sanction, Constantine giving the bishop’s court concurrent jurisdiction with the ordinary civil courts where both parties preferred the former, and by a later enactment going so far as to empower one of the parties to a suit to remove it to the ecclesiastical tribunal against the will of the other. For various reasons, advantage was taken of this power of resorting to the bishop to an extent which seriously interfered with the proper discharge of his spiritual functions, so that Honorius judged it expedient to revert to the original rule, and, at least as regarded laymen, to limit the right of resort to the episcopal judicatory to cases in which both parties consented. It is impossible to say with any approach to exactitude what effect this intervention of the clergy as judges in ordinary civil causes— for they had no criminal jurisdiction—had on the development of the law. But it can hardly have been without some influence in still further promoting the tendency to subordinate act and word to will and animus, to deal leniently with technicalities, and to temper the rules of the jus civile with equity and considerations of natural right.
[9:20:711]

Abandonment of the Formular System, of Procedure ^[97. Der Justinianeische Libellprocess, Vierteljahrschrift, sq., sq. sq. Gesch. d. röm. Rechts, sq.] 1 — The formular system, with its remit from the praetor to a sworn judex who was to try the cause, was of infinite advantage to the law; for the judgment was that of a free and independent citizen, untrammelled by officialism, fresh from some centre of business, and in full sympathy with the parties between whom he had to decide. Such a system was incompatible with the political arrangements of Diocletian and Constantine; and it is with no surprise that we find the former of these sovereigns instructing the provincial governors that in future, unless when prevented by pressure of business (or, according to a later constitution of Julian’s, when the matter was of trifling importance), they were themselves to hear the causes brought before them from first to last, as had previously been the practice in the extraordinariae cognitiones. The remit in such cases was not, as formerly, to a private citizen, but to what was called a judex pcdancus, probably a matriculated member of the local bar; and for a time his delegated authority was embodied in a formula after the old fashion. But even this exceptional use of it did not long survive, for an enactment by the two sons of Constantine, conceived in terms the most comprehensive, declared fixed styles to be but traps for the unwary, and forbade their use in any legal act whatever, whether contentious or voluntary. The result was, not only the formal disappearance of the distinction between the proceedings in jure and in judicio, but the practical disappearance also of the distinctions between actions in jus and in factum, and between actiones directae and actiones utiles, the conversion of the interdict into an actio ex inter-dicto, admission of the power of amendment of the pleadings, condemnation in the specific thing claimed, if in existence, instead of its pecuniary equivalent, and execution accordingly by the aid of officers of the law.

Under the new system a process was full from first to last of intervention by officials. The in jus vocatio of the XII. Tables —the procedure by which a plaintiff himself brought his adversary into court—was a thing of the past. In the earlier part of the period the proceedings commenced with the litis denuntiatio introduced in the time of Marcus Aurelius and remodelled by Constantine; but under Justinian (though probably begun before his reign) the initial step was what was called the libellus convenlionis. This wa3 a short and precise written statement addressed by the plaintiff to the court, explaining (but without detail) the nature of the action he proposed to raise and the claim he had to prefer; this was accompanied with a formal undertaking to proceed with the cause and follow it out to judgment, under penalty of having to pay double costs to the defendant. If the judge was satisfied of the relevancy of the libel, he pronounced an interlocutor (inter-locutio) ordaining its service on the respondent; this was done by an officer of the court, who cited him to appear on a day named, usually at a distance of two or three months. The defendant, through the officer, put in an answer (libellus contradictionis), at the same time giving security for the proper maintenance of the defence and eventual satisfaction of the judgment. On the day appointed the parties were first heard on any dilatory pleas, such as defect of jurisdiction; if none were offered, or those stated repelled, they then proceeded to expound their respective grounds of action and defence, each finally making oath of his good faith in the matter (juramentum calumniae), and their counsel doing the same.

From this point, which marked the litis contcstatio or joinder of issue, the procedure was much the same as that in judicio under the formular system. But in all cases in which the demand was that a particular thing should be given or restored, and the plaintiff desired to have the thing itself rather than damages, execution was specific and effected through officers of the law (manic militari). Where, on the other hand, the condemnation was pecuniary, the usual course was for the judge, through his officers, to take possession of such things belonging to the defendant as were thought sufficient to satisfy the judgment (pignus in causa judicati captum), and they were eventually sold judicially if the defendant still refused to pay; the missio in bona of the classical period was rarely resorted to except in the case of insolvency.

The Falentinianian Law of Citations ^[98. heod. Cod., Rhein. Museum f. Jurisprud., sq., Verm. Schriften, sq. Rechtshist. Abhandl. u. Studien, sq.; Röm. Rechtsgesch., sq.] 2— This famous enactment, the production of Theodosius (II.), tutor of the youthful Valentinian III., was issued from Ravenna in the year 426, and was addressed to the Roman senate. It ran thus:—

“We accord our approval to all the writings of Tapinian, Paul, Gaius, Ulpian, and Modestine, conceding to Gaius the same authority that is enjoyed by Paul, Ulpian, and the rest, and sanctioning the citation of all his works. We ratify also the jurisprudence (scicn- tia) of those earlier writers whose treatises and statements of the law the aforesaid five have imported into their own works,— Scaevola, for example, and Sabinus, and Julian, and Marcellus,—and of all others whom they have been in the habit of quoting as authorities (omniumque quos illi eelebrarunt), provided always, as their antiquity makes them uncertain, that the texts of those earlier jurists are verified by collation of manuscripts. If divergent dicta be adduced, that party shall prevail who has the greatest number of authorities on his side; if the number on each side be the same, that one shall prevail which has the support of Papinian; but, whilst he, most excellent of them all, is to be preferred to any other single authority, he must yield to any two. [Paul’s and Ulpian’s notes on his writings, however, as already enacted, are to be disregarded.] Where opinions are equal, and none entitled to preference, we leave it to the discretion of the judge which he shall adopt.”

This constitution has always been regarded as a signal proof of the lamentable condition into which jurisprudence had sunk in the beginning of the 5th century. Constantine, a hundred years earlier, had condemned the notes of Ulpian and Paul upon Papinian. There were no longer any living jurists to lay down the law (jura condere) ; and, if it was to be gathered from the writings of those who were dead, it was well that the use of them should be regulated. The Valentiniauiau law proceeded so far in the same direction. It made a selection of the jurisconsults of the past whose works alone were to be allowed to be cited,—Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and Modestine, the four latest patented counsel of any distinction; Gaius, of authority previously only in the schools, but whose writings were now approved universally, notwithstanding that he had never possessed the jus respondendi ; and all the earlier jurists to whom those five had accorded their imprimator. But it went yet a step further, for it declared all of them, with the sole exception of Papinian, to be of the same authority, and degraded the function of the judge in most cases, so far at least as a question of law was concerned, to the purely arithmetical task of counting up the names which the industry of the advocates on either side had succeeded in adducing in support of their respective contentions. It is probable that, from the days of Hadrian down to Alexander Severus, when the emperor in his council had to frame a rescript or a decree, its tenor would be decided by the vote of the majority; but that was after argument and counter-argument, which must in many cases have modified first impressions. Taking the votes of dead men, who had not heard each other’s reasons for their opinions, was a very different process. It may have been necessary; but it can have been so only because a living jurisprudence had no existence,—because the constructive talent of the earlier empire had entirely disappeared.

II. Axtejustinianian Collections of Statute and Jurisprudence.

The Gregorian and Hcrmogenian Codes.— The first of these Codes I was a collection of imperial rescripts (with a few edicts, &c.) made i by one Gregorianus in the very end of the 3d century, and probably: at the instigation of Diocletian, though whether in the East or the j West critics are unable to decide. The collection of Hermogenianus, i also of rescripts, seems to have been a supplement to the earlier one. As the latest enactment in it belongs to the year 365, the probability is that the collection was published about that time. Both Codes, although the work of private parties, received statutory recognition from Theodosius and Valentinian in their commission for the preparation of a collection of edictal law; and from the language of Justinian in reference to them there is reason to believe that in the courts they were regarded as authoritative, even to the ignoring of all rescripts not embodied in them.

The Theodosian Code and Post-Theodosian Novels.— Three years': after the publication of the “law of citations” Theodosius nomis nated a commission to initiate the preparation of a body of law which, if his scheme had been carried into execution, would have rendered that of Justinian unnecessary. In a constitution some ten years later he explains the motives that had actuated him,—that he saw with much concern the poverty-stricken condition of jurisprudence and how very few men there were who, notwithstanding the prizes that awaited them, were able to make themselves familiar with the whole range of law; and that he attributed it very much to the multitude of books and the large mass of statutes through which it was dispersed, and which it was next to impossible for any ordinary mortal to master. His scheme was eventually to compile one single code from materials derived alike from the writings of the jurists, the Gregorian and Hermogenian collections of rescripts, and the edictal laws from the time of Constantine downwards. His language leaves no doubt that it was his intention to have this general code very carefully prepared, so as to make it a complete exponent of the law in force, which should take the place of everything, statutory or jurisprudential, of an earlier date. The collection of edicts which he directed his commissioners to prepare, and which was to contain all that had not been displaced by later legislation, even though some of them might be obsolete by disuse, was to be [9:20:712]the first step in the execution of his project. For some reason or other nothing followed upon this enactment; and in 435 a new and stronger commission was nominated to collect the edicts, but nothing was said in then-instructions about anything ulterior. The work was completed in three years, and published at Constantinople early in the year 438, with the declaration that it should take effect from 1st January following; and a copy was communicated to Valentinian, who ordained that it should come into force in the West from 12th January 439. The arrangement is in sixteen books, subdivided into titles, in which the constitutions are placed in chronological order. They cover the whole field of law, private and public, civil and criminal, fiscal and municipal, military and ecclesiastical. The private law is contained in the first five, which unfortunately are very defective. The imperial edicts subsequent to the publication of the Code got the name of Novels (novellae constitutiones). The Collatio, the Vatican Fragments, and the Consultatio.— These were unofficial collections. The first— Collatio Legum Mosaica-rum et Romanarum, otherwise Lex Dei quam Dominus praecepit ad Moysen— is a parallel of divine and human law, the former drawn from the Pentateuch and the latter from the writings of Gaius, Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and Modestine, rescripts from the Gregorian and Hermogenian Codes, and one or two later general enactments. Its date is probably about the year 390, but its authorship is unknown. The Vatican Fragments were discovered by Mai in a palimpsest in the Vatican in 1820,—evidently part of a book of practice compiled in the Westem empire, and of very considerable dimensions. The extant fragments deal with the law of sale, usufruct, dowries, donations, tutories, and processual agency, and are drawn from the writings of Papinian, Ulpian, and Paul, the two collections of rescripts, and a few general enactments, the latest dating from the year 372. The compilation, therefore, may be of about the same antiquity as the Collatio. The Consultatio (Veteris cujusdam Jurisconsulti Consultatio') was first published by Cujas in 1577. It seems to be part of a collection of answers upon questions of law submitted for the opinion of counsel, and is of value, for the fragments it contains from Paul’s Sentences and the three Codes. It is thought to have been written in France in the end of the 5th or beginning of the 6th century.

The Romano-Barbarian Codes.— This title is usually applied to three collections compiled in western Europe after it had thrown off the sovereignty of Rome.

1. The Edictum Theodorici was compiled at the instance of Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, in or very soon after the year 500. Its materials were drawn from the writings of the jurists— principally the Sentences of Paul—the Gregorian, Hermogenian, and Theodosian Codes, and the later Novels, all reduced into 154 sections, with no systematic arrangement, but touching upon all branches of the law public and private, especially criminal law and procedure. It was professedly intended to apply to all Theodoric’s subjects, both Goths and Romans.

2. The Lex Romana Visigothorum or Breviarium Alaricianum was a much more ambitious and important collection. It was compiled by a commission appointed by Alaric II., king of the Western Goths, with approval of the bishops and nobles, and published at Aire in Gascony in the year 506. The compilers selected their material partly from leges (statute law) and partly from jus (jurisprudential law), taking what they considered appropriate, without altering the text except in the way of excision of passages that were obsolete or purely historical. For the leges they utilized some 400 of the 3400 enactments (according to Haenel’s estimate) of the Theodosian Code, and about 30 of the known 104 post-Theodosian Novels; for the jus,— the Institutes of Gaius, Paul’s Sentences, the Gregorian and Hermogenian rescripts, and the first book of Papinian’s Responses (a single sentence). All of these, except Gaius, were accompanied with an “interpretation,” which resembles the interpretatio of the XII. Tables in that it is often not so much explanatory of the text as qualificative or corrective. Gaius is contained in an epitome in two books, believed to have been only a reproduction of an abridgment already current, and dating from about the beginning of the 5th century. The Breviary exercised very considerable influence in Europe generally; and there is no question that, until the rise of the Bologna school in the 12th century, it was from it, rather than from the books of Justinian, that western Europe acquired its scanty knowledge of Roman law’.

3. The Lex Romana Burgundionum, formerly, owing to a mistake of a transcriber, called Papianus, is the collection which King Gundobald, wdien publishing his code of native law (Lex Burgundionum or Gundobada), had promised should be prepared for the use of his Roman subjects. It deals with private law, criminal law, and judicial procedure, distributed through 47 titles, and is arranged very much after the order of the Gundobada, from which it has a few extracts. Its statutory Roman sources are the same as those of the Breviary ; the jurisprudential authorities referred to are Gaius and Paul, the latter in his Sentences, and the former (only three times altogether) in some other book than his Institutes.

III. The Justinianian Legislation. Justinian’s Collections and his own Legislation.— It is unnecessary to revert to the history of Justinian outside his legislative achievements, or even to speak of his collections in detail, for both have already been described in the article Justinian I. (vol. xiii. p. 792 sq.). Ambitious to carry out a reform more complete even than that which Theodosius had planned but failed to execute, he took the first step towards it little more than six months after the death of his uncle Justin, in the appointment of a commission to prepare a collection of statute law (leges), among which he included the rescripts of the Gregorian and Hermogenian Codes. It was published in April 529; and in rapid succession there followed his Fifty Decisions (529-532), his Institutes (21st November 533), his Digest of excerpts from the writings of the jurists (16th December

533) , and the revised edition of his Code, in which he incorporated his own legislation down to date (16th November

534) . From that time down to his death in 565 there followed a series of Novels (novellae constitutiones), mostly in Greek, which were never officially collected, and of which probably many have been lost.

Taking his enactments in the Code and his Novels together we have of Justinian’s own legislation about 400 constitutions. Diocletian’s contributions to the Code are about three times as numerous; but most of them professed to be nothing more than short declaratory statements of pre-existing law, whereas Justinian’s, apart from his Fifty Decisions, were all reformatory enactments, many of them as long as an average Act of Parliament, and dealing with diverse matters under the same rubric. They cover the whole field of law, public and private, civil and criminal, secular and ecclesiastical. It cannot be said that they afford pleasant reading: they are so disfigured by redundancy of language, involved periods, and nauseous self-glorification. But it cannot be denied that many of those which deal with the private law embody reforms of the highest importance and of most salutary tendency. He sometimes loved to pose as the champion of the simplicity and evenhandedness of the early law, at others to denounce it for its subtleties; sometimes he allowed himself to be influenced by his own extreme asceticism, and now and again we detect traces of subservience to the imperious will of his consort; but in the main his legislation was dictated by what he was pleased to call humanitas so far as the law of persons was concerned, and by naturalis ratio and public utility so far as concerned that of things. The result was the eradication of almost every trace of the old jus Quiritium, and the substitution for it, under the name of jus Romanum, of that cosmopolitan body of law which has contributed so largely to almost every modern system.

Amendments on the Law of the Family.— With the Christian emperors the last traces disappeared of the old conception of the familia as an aggregate of persons and estate subject absolutely to the power and dominion of its head. Manus, the power in a husband over his wife and her belongings, was a thing of the past; both stood now on a footing of equality before the law; perhaps it might be more accurate to say, at least with reference to the Justinianian legislation, that the wife was the more privileged of the two in respect both of the protection and the indulgence the law accorded her. With manus the old confarreation and coemption had ceased, marriage needing nothing more than simple interchange of consent, except as between persons of rank or when the intention was to legitimate previous issue; in the latter case a written marriage settlement was required, and in the former either such a settlement or a marriage in church before the bishop and at least three clerical witnesses, who granted and signed a certificate of the completed union. The legislation of the Christian emperors on the subject of divorce, largely contributed to by Justinian in his Novels, has already been referred to. In regard to dowries many new provisions were introduced, principally for curtailing the husband’s power of dealing with the dowry while the marriage lasted, enlarging the right of the wife and her heirs in respect of it, and simplifying [9:20:713]the means of recovering it from the husband or his heirs when the marriage was dissolved. Between the time of Constantine and that of Theodosius and Valentinian it had become the practice for a man to make a settlement on his intended wife of a provision which was to remain his property (but without the power of alienation) during the marriage, but to pass to her on his predecease; it got the name of donatio ante nuptias or sometimes, as being a sort of return for the dos, antiphema. The earliest legislation about it was by the last - mentioned emperors; Zeno and Justin followed suit; and Justinian, in Code and Novels, published five or six enactments for its regulation. The general result was that, wherever a dos was given or promised on the part of the wife, there a donatio was to be constituted on the part of the husband; that, if one was increased during the marriage, a corresponding increase was to be made to the other; that it might be constituted after the marriage without infringing the rule prohibiting donations between husband and wife, which caused Justinian to change its name to donatio propter nuptias ; that the wife might demand its transfer to her (as she could that of the dos) on her husband’s insolvency, but under obligation to apply its income to the maintenance of the family; and that on the dissolution of the marriage by her husband’s death or by a divorce for which he was in fault she had ample remedies for reducing it into possession.

The change in the complexion of the relations between husband and wife under the Christian emperors, however, was insignificant when compared with that which had overtaken the relation between parent and child. Justinian in his Institutes reproduces the boast of Gaius that nowhere else had a father such power over his children as was exercised by a Roman paterfamilias. True it is that the patria potestas in name still held a prominent place in the Justinianian collections; but it had been shorn of most of the prerogatives that had characterized it in the republic. To expose a new-born child was forbidden under penalties. To take the life of a grownup one—unless it was a daughter slain with her paramour in the act of adultery—was murder; for the domestic tribunal, with the judicial power of life and death in the paterfamilias as its head, had long disappeared. For the same reason a parent could no longer sell his child as a slave, at least he could do so only when the child was an infant and he in such extreme poverty as to be unable to support it. Even the right to make a noxal surrender of his son to a party who had suffered from the latter’s delict had silently become obsolete; so greatly had altered sentiment, in sympathy with legislation, curtailed the power of the paterfamilias over those in his potestas. All that remained of it in the latest Justinianian law was no more than is sanctioned in most modern systems as natural emanations of the paternal relationship,—the rights of moderate chastisement for offence, of testamentary nomination of guardians, of pupilary substitution (enlarged by Justinian), and of withholding consent from the marriage of a child, but subject to magisterial intervention if used unreasonably.

How the right of the paterfamilias over the earnings and acquisitions of his children was modified by the recognition of the, peculium castrense has been shown in a previous page (p. 706). But the modification was carried to such an extent by the Christian emperors as finally to negative the father’s ownership altogether, except as regarded acquisitions that were the outcome of funds advanced by him to his child for his separate use (peculium profecticium). Of some of the child’s acquisitions his father had, down to the time of Justinian, the life interest and right of administration; but by his legislation even these might be excluded at the pleasure of the parties from whom the acquisitions had been derived. By the classical law the father’s radical right in his son’s peculium castrense revived on the latter’s death; for if he died intestate the former appropriated it not as his son’s heir, but as an owner whose powers as such had been merely temporarily suspended. But by one of the chapters in the famous Novel on the law of intestate succession even this prerogative of the paterfamilias was abolished, and all a child’s belongings except his peculium profecticium were recognized as his own in death as well as in life, so that if any of them should pass to his parent on his intestacy it should only be by title of inheritance and in the absence of descendants.

In every other branch of the law of the family the same reforming spirit was manifested. Adoption was no longer followed in all cases by a change of family for the adoptee, but only when the adopter was in fact one of his parents, such as a paternal or maternal grandfather,—when there was a natural potestas to underlie and justify the civil one. The modes of legitimation of children born out of wedlock, especially that by subsequent marriage of the parents, first introduced by Constantine, were regulated, and the extent of the rights of the legitimated issue carefully defined. Emancipation was simplified, and the old procedure by sales and manumissions, which degraded the child too much to the level of a slave, dispensed with. Tutory at law was opened to the pupil’s nearest kinsman, whether on the father’s side or the mother’s; and the mother herself, or the child’s grandmother, might be allowed, under certain conditions, to act as its guardian. Slavery was often converted into the milder condition of colonate; but, even where this did not happen, the rights of owners were not allowed to be abused; for slaves were permitted to claim the protection of the magistrate, and cruelty by a master might result in his being deprived of his human property. Kinship that had arisen between two persons when one or both were slaves (servilis cognatio) was recognized as creative not only of disabilities but of rights. The modes of manumission were multiplied, and the restrictions of the legislation of the early empire abolished; and a freedman invariably became a citizen, Junian Latinity and dediticiancy being no longer recognized.

Amendments on the Law of Property and Obligation.— In the law of property the principal changes of the Christian empire were the simplification of the forms of conveyance, the extension of the colonate, the introduction and regulation of emphyteusis, and the remodelling of the law of prescription. Simplification of the forms of conveyance was necessary only in the case of res mancipi, for res nec mancipi had always passed by delivery. From the Theodosian Code it is apparent that movable res mancipi usually passed in the same way from very early in the period, and that for the mancipation of lands and houses (for in jure cessio had disappeared with the formular system) a solemnis traditio, a written instrument and delivery following thereon, and both before witnesses, was gradually substituted. Of this there is no trace in the Justinianian Code. For Justinian abolished all remains of the distinction between res mancipi and res nec mancipi, between full ownership, bonitarian ownership, and nudum jus Quiritium, placing movables and immovables on a footing of perfect equality so far as their direct conveyance was concerned. But, as regarded the possession required of an alienee to cure any defect in the conveyance, he made a marked difference between them. For, amalgamating the old positive usucapion of the jus civile with .the negative “prolonged possession” (longi temporis posscssio) that had been introduced in the provinces (probably by the provincial edict), he declared that possession on a sufficient title and in good faith should in future make the possessor legal owner of the thing possessed by him, provided that the possession of himself and his author had endured uninterruptedly for three years in the case of a movable, and in the case of an immovable for ten years if the party against whom he possessed was resident in the same province, or for twenty if he resided in another one.

The same causes that led to the colonate induced the introduction of emphyteusis ^[99. Studi storici sopra il Contratto d’Enfiteusi nelle sue relazioni col Colonato, De VEmphytéose,] —an institution which had already existed in some of the Eastern provinces when independent, and which came to be utilized first by the emperors, then by the church, and afterwards by municipalities and private landowners, for bringing into cultivation the large tracts of provincial land belonging to them which were unproductive and unprofitable through want of supervision on the spot. Its nature and conditions were carefully defined by Zeno and amended by Justinian. The emphyteuta, as the grantee of the right was called, did not become owner; the granter still remained dominus, all that the grantee enjoyed being &jus in re aliena, but de facto so extensive as hardly to be distinguishable from ownership. It conferred upon him and his heirs a perpetual right in the lands included in the grant, in consideration of a fixed annual payment to the lord (canon) and due observance of conventional and statutory conditions; but he was not entitled to abandon it, nor able to free himself of the obligations he had undertaken, without the lord’s consent. The latter was entitled to hold the grant forfeited if the canon fell into arrear for three years (in church lands for two), or if the land-tax was in arrear for the same period, or if the emphyteuta allowed the lands to deteriorate, or if he attempted to alienate them (alienare meliorationes, as the text says) without observance of statutory requirements. These were that he should intimate an intended alienation and the name of the intended alienee to the lord, so that the latter, before giving his assent, might satisfy himself that he would not be a loser by the transaction; and, if the alienation was to be by sale, he had to state the price fixed, so as to give the lord the opportunity of exercising his statutory right of pre-emption at the same figure. If those requirements were complied with, and the lord had no reasonable objection to the proposed alienee, he was not entitled to resist the alienation, provided a payment (laudemium) was made to him of two per cent, of the sale-price in consideration of his enforced consent.

The changes in the law of obligation were more superficial than those in the law of property, and consisted principally in the simplification of formalities and in some cases in their entire abolition. To describe them, however, would cany us into details which would here be out of place.

Amendments on the Law of Succession.— The changes made in the law of succession by Justinian’s Christian predecessors, especially Theodosius II. and Anastasius, were far from insignificant; but his own were in some directions positively revolutionary. The testament per aes et libram of the jus civile probably never obtained any firm footing in the East; for it was only by Caracalla’s con[9:20:714]stitution conferring citizenship on all his free subjects that provincials generally acquired tcstamenti factio ; and by that time a testament bearing externally the requisite number of seals had been recognized as sufficient for a grant of bonorum possessio, unchallengeable by the heirs-at-law, even though they were able to prove that neither familiae mancipatio nor tcstamenti nuncupatio had intervened. Hence the universal adoption of what Justinian calls the preetorian testament, which, however, underwent considerable reform at the hands of the emperors, notably in the requirement (in the ordinary case) of signature by the testator and subscription by the witnesses. There was much hesitating legislation on the subject before the law was finally established as it stands in the Justinianian books; and even at the last we find it encumbered with many exceptions and reservations in favour of testaments that were merely deeds of division by a parent among his children, testaments made in time of plague, testaments recorded in books of court, testaments entrusted to the safe-keeping of the emperor, and so forth. Codicils had become deeds of such importance as, in the absence of a testament, to be dealt with as imposing a trust on the heir-at-law; it was therefore thought expedient to deny effect to them unless attested by at least five witnesses. And a most important step in advance was taken by Justinian in the recognition of the validity of an oral mortis causa trust; for he declared that, if it should be represented to a competent judge that a person on his deathbed had by word of mouth directed his heir-at-law to give something to the complainant, the heir should be required either on his oath to deny the averment or to give or pay what was claimed.

In the matter of intestacy there was long a halting between two opinions,—a desire still further to amend the law in the direction taken by the prsetors and by the legislature in the Tertullian and Orphitian senatusconsults, and yet a hesitancy about breaking altogether from the time-hallowed principle of agnation. Justinian in his Code went far beyond his predecessors, making a mother’s right of succession independent altogether of the jus liberorum; extending that of a daughter or sister to her descendants, without any deduction in favour of agnates thus excluded; admitting emancipated collaterals and their descendants as freely as if there had been no capitis deminutio minima ; applying to agnates the same successio graduum that the prsetors had allowed to cognates, and so forth. But it was by his Novels, especially the 118th and 127th, that he revolutionized the system, by eradicating agnation altogether and settling the canons of descent—which were the same for real and personal estate—solely on the basis of blood kinship, whether through males or females, and whether crossed or not by a capitis deminutio. First came descendants of the intestate, male and female alike, taking per capita if all were of the same degree, per stirpes if of different degrees. Failing descendants, the succession passed to the nearest ascendants, and, concurrently with them, to brothers and sisters of full blood and (by Nov. 127) the children of any that had predeceased. Where there were ascendants alone, one-half of the succession went to the paternal line and one-half to the maternal; where there were ascendants and brothers and sisters, or only brothers and sisters, the division was made equally per capita ; when children of a deceased brother or sister participated it was per stirpes. In the third class came brothers and sisters of half-blood or by adoption and their children; the division here was on the same principle as in the second class. The fourth class included all other collaterals according to propinquity, and without distinction between full and half blood; the primary division was per stirpes, but all of the same degree took per capita.

A reform effected by Justinian by his 115th Novel ought not to pass unnoticed; for it rendered superfluous all the old rules about disherison and praeterition of a testator’s children, practically abolished bonorum possessio contra tabulas, and established the principle that a child had, as a general rule, an inherent and indefeasible right to be one of his father’s heirs in a certain share at all events of his succession, and that a parent had the same right in the succession of his child if the latter had died without issue. The enactment enumerated certain grounds upon which alone it should be lawful for a parent to disinherit his child or a child his parent, declaring that in eveiy case of disherison the reason of it should be stated in the testament, but giving leave to the person disinherited to dispute and disprove the facts when the testament was opened. If a child who had not been disinherited—and one improperly disinherited was eventually in the same position—was not instituted to at least his “legitim” {legitima or debita portio), he was entitled to have the testament declared null in so far as the institutions in it were concerned, thus opening the succession to himself and the other heirs-at-law, but without affecting the minor provisions, such as bequests, nominations of tutors, &c. The legitim, which under the practice of the centumviral court had been one-fourth of the share to which the child would have been entitled ab intestato, was raised by Justinian to one-third at least, and one-half where there were five or more entitled to participate. He did not allow challenge of the will to be excluded, as in the earlier querela inofficiosi tcstamenti, because the testator had made advances to his child during his life or left him a legacy which quantitatively equalled the legitim; his idea was that a child was entitled to recognition by his parent as one of his heirs, and that to deny him that position was to put upon him an indignity which the law would not permit.

Amongst the other beneficial changes effected by Justinian may be mentioned the assimilation so far as possible of hcreditas and bonorum possessio, so that the latter might be taken like the former without formal petition for a grant of it; the equiparation of legacies and singular trust-gifts, and the application of some of their rules to mortis causa donations; the extension of the rule of “transmission” to every heir without exception, so that, if he died within the time allowed him for considering whether or not he would accept {tempos deliberandi), his power of acceptance or declinature passed to his heirs, to be exercised by them within what remained of the period; the introduction of entry under inventory {cum beneficio inventarii), which limited the heir’s responsibilities and rendered unnecessary the nine or twelve months of deliberation; and the application of the principle of collation to descendants generally, so that they were bound to throw into the mass of the succession before its partition every advance they had received from their parent in anticipation of their shares.

IV. The Justinianian Law-Books.

Their Use in the Courts and in the Schools.— Although the Institutes were primarily intended to serve as a text-book in the schools, it was expressly declared that they and the Digest and the Code should be regarded as just so many parts of one great piece of legislation and all of equal authority, and that, although Digest and Code were but collections of legislation and doctrine that had proceeded originally from many different hands, yet they were to be treated with the same respect as if they had been the work of Justinian himself. But, while everything within them was to be held as law, nothing outside them was to be looked at, not even the volumes from which they had been collected; and so far did this go that, after the publication of the revised Code, neither the first edition of it nor the Fifty Decisions were allowed to be referred to. If a case arose for which no precedent was to be found, the emperor was to be resorted to for its decision, as being outside his collections the only fountain of the law. To preserve the purity of the texts Justinian forbade the use of conventional abbreviations {sigla) in making transcripts, visiting an offender with the penalties of falsification {crimen falsi). Literal translations into Greek were authorized, and indeed were very necessary for many of his subjects; so were 7rapaTtrXa or summaries of the contents of individual titles (although the jurists read the word less strictly). Commentaries and general summaries were forbidden under heavy penalties, as an interference with the imperial prerogative of interpretation; but the prohibition does not seem to have been enforced, as we have accounts and remains not only of translations but of commentaries, notes, abridgments, excerpts, and general summaries even in Justinian’s lifetime. These, it is true, were mostly by professors {antecessores), and their productions may have been intended primarily for educational purposes; but there can be little doubt that they soon passed into the hands of the practitioners and were used without scruple in the courts. A Greek Paraphrase of the Institutes, usually attributed to Theophilus, a professor in Constantinople and one of Justinian’s commissioners, is commonly supposed to have been used by him in his prelections. It embodies much more historical matter than is to be found in the Institutes ; but its value has been very differently rated by different critics. Its latest editor, Ferrini, who puts a high estimate on it, is of opinion that the original of it was a paraphrase of Gaius, which was remodelled after the plan of Justinian’s Institutes, and had their new matter incorporated in order to adapt it to the altered conditions; but he doubts if there be any sufficient authority for ascribing it to Theophilus. If he be right in assuming that it was really a redaction of Gaius, the historical explanations will bejeceived with all the more confidence.

Fate of the Justinianian Books in the East.— The literary work indicated in the preceding section was continued throughout the 6th century. But the next three were comparatively barren, the only thing worth noting being the ’EKÁ0777 tGiv vbyuv év crvvT¿fj.ifi yevopévy of Leo the Isaurian in 740, professedly an abstract of the whole Justinianian law amended and rearranged; but it was repealed by Basil the Macedonian on account of its imperfections and its audacious departure from the law it pretended to summarize. The last-named emperor, with his son Leo the Philosopher, set themselves in the end of the 9th and beginning ©f the 10th centuries to the production of an authoritative Greek version of the whole of the Justinianian collections and legislation, omitting what had become obsolete, excising redundancies, and introducing such of the post-Justinianian legislation as merited preservation. The result was the Basilica (Tá BcnrtXtKá, i.e., vb/uapa), which was completed in the reign of Leo, though probably issued in a preparatory stage in the reign of Basil, who also published a sort of institutional work, the Ilpó^eípor, which was revised and republished by Leo under [9:20:715]the name of ’ETay ayuyg tov vbyov. The Basilica consists of sixty books, subdivided into titles, following generally the plan of the Justinianian Code, but with the whole law on any particular subject arranged consecutively, whether from Digest, Code, or Novels (see Basilica, vol. iii. p. 419). Leo’s son, Constantinus Porphyro-genitus, made an addition to it in the shape of an official commentary collected from the writings of the 6th-century jurists, the so-called lAapdypafpai tuv iraXaiuv, which is now spoken of as the scholia to the Basilica, and has done good exegetical service for modern civilians. The Basilica retained its statutory authority until the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1453. But long before that it had practically been abandoned; and not a single complete copy of it exists. Its place was taken by epitomes and compendia, the last being the E$d/3t/3\os of Constantinus Harmenopulus of 1345, “a miserable epitome of the epitomes of epitomes,” as Bruns calls it, which survived the vicissitudes of the centuries, and finally received statutory authority in the modern kingdom of Greece in the year 1835, in place of the Basilica, which had been sanctioned thirteen years before, in 1822.

Their Fate in the West. — Before the rise of the Bologna school it was to a much greater extent from the Romano-barbarian codes than from the books of Justinian that central and western Europe derived their acquaintance with Roman law. Theodoric’s Edict can have had little influence after Justinian’s recovery of Italy, and the Romano-Burgundian law was no doubt gradually displaced by the Breviary {Lex Rom. Fisigothorum} after Burgundy had fallen into the hands of the Franks; but the Breviary itself found its way in all directions in France and Germany, penetrating even into England, to a great extent through the agency of the church. There must, however, have been other repertories of Roman law in circulation, as witness a testament made in Paris in the end of the 7th century, preserved by Mabillon, in which the testator uses the old formula of theyiis civile,— “ita do, ita lego, ita testor, ita vos Quirites testimonium mihi perhibetote,”—words that are not to be found either in the Visigothic or the Justinianian collections.

In his pragmatic sanction of the year 554 Justinian anew accorded his imperial sanction to the jura and leges, i.e., the Digest and Code, which he says he had long before transmitted to Italy, at the same time declaring that his Novels were to be of the same authority there as in the East. Two years after this came Julian’s Latin epitome of them, not improbably prepared by command of the emperor himself. That they all came at once to some extent into use is beyond question; for there is preserved in Marini’s collection the testament of one Mannanes, executed at Ravenna in the reign of Justinian’s immediate successor Justin II., in which the requirements of both Code and Novels are scrupulously observed. Of other monuments of the same period that prove the currency of the Justinianian law in Italy several are referred to by Savigny in the second volume of his History of the Roman Law in the Middle Ages, among which may be mentioned the Turin gloss of the Institutes, which Fitting ascribes to about the year 545, and two little pieces known as the Dictatum de consiliariis and the Collectio de tutoribus, which form an appendix to some manuscripts of Julian’s epitome of the Novels, and may possibly have been from his pen. The invasion of the Lombards, the disturbance they caused in Italy for two centuries, and the barrier they formed between it and the rest of Europe militated against the spread of the Justinianian law northwards; but it was taught without much interruption in Ravenna, the seat of the exarchs; to which (but this is doubtful) the school {studium} of Rome, revived by Justinian, is said to have been transferred. By the Lombards, as their savagery toned down, the Roman law was so far recognized that they allowed it to be applied to the Romans living within their territory; and it is said to have even been taught in Pavia, which they had established as their capital. Their overthrow by Charlemagne opened an outlet for it beyond Italy; and in the 9th century there is evidence that the Justinianian books or some of them were already circulating in the hands of the clergy in various parts of Europe. Yet there are very few remains of any literature indicating much acquaintance with them. Almost the only pieces worth mentioning are the so-called Summa Perusina, an abridgment of the first eight books of the Code, ascribed to the 9th century; the Quaestiones ac monita, to the Lombardic laws, drawn mostly from the Institutes, but with a few texts from the Digest, the Code, and Julian’s Epitome, and supposed to have been written early in the 11th century; the Brachylogus, an abbreviated revision of Justinian’s Institutes, with references to his other books, which is thought to have been written in France (Orleans?), according to Fitting between 999 and 1002, but according to other authorities nearer the end of the 11th century; and the Petri exceptiones legum Romanarum, a systematic exposition of the law in four books, written in-the south of France early in the latter half of the 11th century, and mostly compiled from Justinianian sources.

It was in the very end of the 11th century or the beginning of the 12th that at Bologna, and under one Irnerius, who appears not to have been a professional jurist but originally a teacher of letters, the study of Roman law began somewhat suddenly to attract students from all parts of the world. Through the action of the clergy the only parts of the Justinianian legislation that had hitherto been in ordinary use were the Institutes, the Code, and the Novels. The first, from its elementary character, had naturally commended itself; the Code, with its opening title on the Trinity and its second on Holy Church, and the Novels, with their abundant legislation on matters ecclesiastical, were in many respects charters of the church’s privileges, and were prized accordingly; but the Digest, as being the work of pagan jurists, had been practically ignored. The Code and the Novels, however, with their modicum of wheat concealed in such a quantity of chaff, offered little attraction to laymen of intelligence; and, when a copy of a portion of the Digest, with its infinitely purer diction and its clear and incisive reasoning, came into the hands of Irnerius, it must have been for him as a new revelation. The text of it seems to have reached him by instalments; at least this is the only reasonable explanation of its division by the glossarists (as Irnerius and his successors of the Bologna school were called, the name being derived from the glossae, notes marginal and interlinear, with which they furnished it) into three parts, Digestum Fetus (books 1 to 24, tit. 2), Infortiatum, and Digestum Novum (book 39 to the end), the general idea being that, after first the old and then the new Digest had come to light, the connecting link unexpectedly turned up, and got in consequence the somewhat singular name by which it continued to be known for centuries. The whole collection was by the glossarists distributed in five volumes, the fourth containing the first nine books of the Code, and the fifth, called Folumen parvum legum, containing the Institutes, a Latin translation of 134 of the Novels known as the Authenticum, and the last three books of the Code which had been recovered subsequently to the others. With these five volumes, the teaching that accompanied them, and the glossae, summae, casus, brocarda, &c., with which they were enriched from the rise of the school with Irnerius till its close with Franciscus Accursius in 1260, Roman jurisprudence began a new career, which it would carry us beyond the limits of this article to attempt to trace even in meagrest outline.^[100.
