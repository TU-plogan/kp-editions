RÉNAUDOT Eusèbe (1646-1720), theologian and Orientalist, was born in Paris in 1646, and was educated for the church. Notwithstanding his taste for theology and his title of abbé, he never took orders, and much of his life was spent at the French court, where he attracted the notice of Colbert and was often employed in confidential affairs. The unusual learning in Eastern tongues which he had acquired in his youth and continued to maintain amidst the distractions of court life did not bear fruit till he was sixty-two years old. His best-known books, which are still valuable, are the Jlistoria Patri-archarum Alexandrinorum (Paris, 1713), and the collection of Eastern liturgies (2 vols., 1715-16). The latter ·work was designed to supply proofs of the “perpetuity of the faith” of the church on the subject of the sacraments, the topic about which most of his theological writings turned, and which was then, in consequence of the controversies attaching to Arnauld’s Perpétuité de la Foi, a burning one between French Catholics and Protestants. Rénaudot was not a very fair controversialist, but his learning and industry are unquestionable, and his piety shone the more brightly that it did not withdraw itself from contact with the world. He died in 1720.
