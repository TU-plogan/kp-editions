ROSAMOND Fair. Rosamond Clifford, mistress of Henry IL, was the daughter of Sir Walter Clifford, a Berkshire knight (Dugdale, Monasticon, iv. 366). She appears to have died in or about the year 1177, and was buried in the nunnery at Godstow. At the command of St Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, her body was removed from the church in which it had been buried, and was interred again outside the church. Such are all the facts that are known about Fair Rosamond. She is said to have been the mother of William Longsword, and of Geoffrey, archbishop of York. But this is impossible, for both William and Geoffrey -were born before 1155, and Rosamond was still a girl at the time of her death. The story of the labyrinth or maze built by Henry to conceal her from Queen Eleanor occurs first in Brompton (end of 12th century). The legend of her death at Queen Eleanor’s hand is variously related, but does not appear to be traceable beyond the first half of the 14th century. It can hardly be true in any form, for Eleanor was in confinement during the last fifteen years of Henry’s reign.
