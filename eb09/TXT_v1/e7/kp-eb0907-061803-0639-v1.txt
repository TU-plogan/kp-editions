EBIONITES, a Christian sect which was separated from the general Christian church about the end of the 2d century. The origin of the name has been much disputed, some deriving it from Ebion as the founder of the sect, and others from the Hebrew word (∏'2⅛) meaning poor. For the former opinion the authority of Tertullian is quoted, who makes references to the existence of such a person as Ebion; but as counterbalancing these references there has to be considered—1st, that Tertullian being careless and inaccurate, and having no knowledge of Hebrew, may have merely fallen into the error of assuming that the sect took its name from that of a person; 2d, that no mention is made of the existence of such a person either by Irenaeus or by Origen, and that any references to him by Epiphanius and later writers are probably borrowed from Tertullian; and 3d, that the name Ebionites had a very general signification, and represented a natural Judaizing tendency which must have had a more comprehensive beginning than that originating in an individual influence. Those who derive the name from the Hebrew word explain it in two ways— as applicable either to the poverty of the doctrines of the Ebionites, or to the poverty of their circumstances. Undoubtedly the name was applied to them with the former significance by their enemies, but it is more probable that they employed in a bad sense a name already existing, than that they coined it to suit their purpose. That the term was originally applied to the circumstances of the Ebionites seems the only probable supposition; and the argument in support of it may be stated thus :—That the early Christians, both Jewish and heathen, were designated the poor; that the poverty of the Jewish Christians continued longer than that of the heathen Christians, and Origen states that they in particular were named the poor (EjSιωvαcoι γjrηgατlζοvσLV οl <χ∙7ro Ιουδαίων τov Iηaδυv ως Χρίστον πaρaδeξapev(κ) ; and that, as the Judaizing Christians came gradually to be the only Jewish Christians who required to be distinguished from the heathen Christians, they retained the name. The fathers show a very imperfect knowledge of the origin, history, and doctrines of the Ebionites, but there cannot be any doubt that at first all Judaizing Christians went under that name. In the New Testament there is evidence of the existence of such a party, though it had not then developed into a recognized sect. This apparently did not happen till after the second destruction of Jerusalem and the founding of the heathen colony of Aelia Capitolina, when the emperor Hadrian banished from the neighbourhood all Jews who still retained their national peculiarities. As to the particular opinions of the Ebionites the statements of the fathers are somewhat contradictory, and this for the threefold reason—that by the isolation of the Ebionites from the general church the information obtainable regarding them could only be imperfect; that undeι [9:7:619] the general name Ebionites a good many varieties of opinion are included; and that their opinions varied at different periods of their history. The term Ebionites is used by some writers to include the Nazarenes, who, while recognizing the binding obligation of the Mosaic law on all Jews, did not regard it as binding on heathen Christians (see Nazarenes); but at an early period the stricter Ebionites must have separated themselves from the Nazarenes, who soon became merged in the general church. Of Ebionites proper Origen distinguishes two classes—those who affirm and those who deny the miraculous birth of Jesus: and in this he is followed by Eusebius. The extreme Ebionites, according to Origen, were only distinguishable from common Jews by the acceptance of the moral teaching of Christ; while those Ebionites who admitted the miraculous birth of Christ did not recognize His divinity proper, but believed that with His human nature the spirit of an angel or archangel, or even of Adam, was incorporated. Both classes of Ebionites seem to have had these points in common :—1st, They emphasized the unity of God; 2d, they affirmed the universal obligation of the Mosaic economy; 3d, of the books of the New Testament they received as genuine only the gospel of St Matthew; 4th, they denounced St Paul as a separatist; and 5th, they believed that Jerusalem was yet to be the city of God, and some of them at least believed in Christ’s millennial reign. In the time of Eusebius the Ebionites inhabited chiefly the coasts of the Dead Sea, but they dwelt also in Rome and Cyprus. They vanished from history in the end of the 4th or beginning of the 5th century.

The ancient authorities on the Ebionites are Irenaeus, Hyp-polytus, Eusebius, Tertullian, Origen, and Theodoret. In modern literature there are—Gieseler, in Stäudlin und Tzschirner's Archiv für ältere und neuere Kirchengeschichte, vol. ii. Leipsic, 1820; Credner in Winer’s Zeitschrift für wissenschaftl. Theologie, Sulzbach, 1829; Baur, De Ebionitarum origine et doctrina ab Essaeis repetenda {Tübinger Osterprogramm von 1831); Hilgenfeld, Die Clementinischen Recognitionen, Jena, 1848; the article “Ebjoniten” in Herzog's Real Encyclopädie; and ManseΓs Gnostic Heresies of the First and Second Centuries, London, 1875.
