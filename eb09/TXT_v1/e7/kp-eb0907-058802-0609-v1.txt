EACHARD, John (1636-1697), an English divine, was born in Suffolk in 1636, and was educated at Catherine Hall, Cambridge, of which he became master in 1675 in succession to Lightfoot. He was created a doctor of divinity in 1676 by royal mandate, and was twice (in 1679 and 1695) vice-chancellor of the university. He died on the 7th July 1697. In 1670 he had published anonymously a humorous satire entitled The Ground and Occasions of the Contempt of the Clergy enquired into in a letter to P. L., which excited much attention and provoked several replies, one of them being from John Owen. These were met by Some Observations, etc., in a second letter to P. L. (1671), written in the same bantering tone as the original work. Eachard attributed the contempt into which the clergy had fallen to their imperfect education, their insufficient incomes, and the want of a true vocation. He gave amusing illustrations of the absurdity and poverty of the current pulpit oratory of his day, some of them being taken from the sermons of his own father. He attacked the philosophy of Hobbes in his Mr Hobbs's State of Nature considered; in a dialogue between Philautus and Timothy (1672), and in his Some Opinions of Mr Hobbs considered in a second dialogue (1673). These were written in their author’s chosen vein of light satire, and Dryden praised them as highly effective within their own range. It is noteworthy that Eachard’s own sermons were not superior to those he satirized. Swift alludes to him as a signal instance of a successful humorist who entirely failed as a serious writer. A collected edition of his works in three volumes, with a notice of hie life, was published in 1774.
