ELBA, the Αμαλία of the Greeks, and Ilvaof the Romans, is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, forming part of the Italian province of Livorno, and lying about 6 miles from the mainland of Italy, from which it is separated by the channel of Piombino, and about 34 miles E. of Corsica. It has a very irregular coast outline, is 18 miles long and 2∣ to 10⅜ miles broad, and has a total area of nearly 90 square miles. It is throughout mountainous, and the highest point, Monte Capanne, is 2925 feet above sea-level. The western portion of the island is granitic, the eastern consists mainly of the sandstone locally known as verrucano, which in some places passes into a talc slate. In the vicinity of Porto Ferrajo the hills are cretaceous. The climate is mild, and, except at some spots on the coast, healthy. Springs are numerous, and the soil is not infertile; but agriculture and cattle-rearing are neglected, and there are no manufactures. Wine, wheat, aloes, dyer’s lichen, and olives and other fruits are produced. The sardine and tunny fisheries, and the manufacture of sea-salt are of some importance; but the principal industry is mining. The iron mines are mostly in the vicinity of Rio Inferiore, and yield abundance of ore, chiefly hematite, of excellent quality. On account of the lack of fuel the ore is not smelted on the island, but is shipped direct to Follonica on the neighbouring coast of Italy, and to the ports of France and England. Marble, alabaster, sulphur, and ores of tin, lead, and silver are among the other mineral products. The principal places in Elba are the chief town Porto Ferrajo, with about 5000 inhabitants, the residence of Napoleon from May 4, 1814, to February 26, 1815, Rio Ferrajo, San Pietro, Porto Longone, and the village of Capoliveri. The population of the island in 1871 was 21,755.

The Argonauts, in quest of Clrcr⅜ are said to have loaded at Portus Argous (Αργώο? ∖ ιμi↑v), now Porto Ferrajo, in Elba. The island was early famous for the richness of its mines, alluded to by v irgil {Aen. x. 173). It was attacked by Phayllus with a Syτacusan fleet, 453 B.c., and subsequently by Apelles, who is stated to have subjugated it. In the 10th century it became a possession of the Pisans, from whom it was taken by the Genoese in 1290. It fell eventually into Spanish hands, came in 1736 under the jurisdiction of Naples, and in 1801 was ceded to the king of Etruria by the treaty of Lunéville. It was united to France in 1803, made over to Napoleon by the Treaty of Paris in 1814, restored to Tuscany in the following year, and in 1860 annexed to Italy.
