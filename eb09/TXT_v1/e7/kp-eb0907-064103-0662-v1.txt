ECKERMANN, John Peter (1792-1854), friend of Goethe, and editor of his works, was born at Winsen in Hanover, in 1792. After serving as a volunteer in the War of Liberation (1813-1814), he obtained an appointment in the war office at Hanover. At the age of twenty-five he became a student at the gymnasium of Hanover and afterwards at the university of Göttingen, returning to Hanover in 1822. His acquaintance with Goethe began in the following year, when he sent to him the manuscript of his Beitrage zur Poesie. Soon afterwards he went to Weimar, and was appointed private secretary to the poet. For several years he was also engaged as tutor to the son of the grand duke. In 1830 he travelled in Italy with Goethe’s son. In 1838 he was named councillor of the grand duchy, and appointed librarian to the grand duchess. Eckermann is chiefly remembered for the important contributions to our knowledge of the great poet contained in his Gespräche mit Goethe, the first and second parts of which appeared in 1836, and the third in 1848. This work was first translated into English by Margaret Fuller, and published at Boston, U.S., in 1839. Another English translation, by John Oxenford, appeared in London in 1850. It has been translated into almost all the European languages, not excepting Turkish. To Eckermann Goethe intrusted the publication of his posthumous works (1832-1833). He was also joint-editor with Riemer of the complete edition of Goethe’s works in 40 vols. (1839-1840). Eckermann died at Weimar, December 3, 1854.
