WINTHROP, John (1587-1649), was born at Groton, Suffolk, England, January 12, 1587. He graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge, about 1605, and was bred to the law. He became a Puritan, and in 1629 was made governor of the Massachusetts Bay Company. The next year he headed the great emigration to Massachusetts, landing at Salem and settling at Boston. The remainder of his life was closely identified with the history of his colony. He was re-elected governor until 1634, and afterwards in 1637-40, 1641-43, and 1646-49. He died at Boston, March 26, 1649.

The tenderness and gentleness of Winthrop’s nature are beyond dispute; even such political opponents as Vane retained their personal friendship for him. These qualities, however, were supplemented by a decided antipathy to democracy in every form, which made him the best of civil leaders for the supporters of the ecclesiastical system of early Massachusetts. A vigorous, perhaps captious, statement of this side of his influence will be found in Brooks Adams’s Emancipation of Massachusetts. His Life and Letters have been edited by his descendant, R. C. Winthrop. His Journal has been edited by James Savage, who has given it the more appropriate and exact title of The History of New England, 1630-1649. The Winthrop Papers are in the Collections of the Massachusetts Historical Society. Winthrop’s descendants have been numerous, and have included an unusual number of men and women of marked ability; see Whitmore’s Notes on the Winthrop Family. One of them, Theodore Winthrop (1828-1861), of New Haven, was one of the earliest victims of the civil war.
