WANSTEAD, a village of Essex, England, now really a London suburb, is situated on a branch of the Great Eastern Railway (Snaresbrook station), 8 miles by rail north-east of Liverpool Street station. It possesses the usual characteristics of the better-class eastern suburbs of London. Wanstead Park, 184 acres in extent, was opened in 1882. A feature of Wanstead is Eagle Pond or Lake, 10½ acres in extent. At Lake House Hood wrote Tylney Hall. The population of the urban sanitary district (area about 1072 acres) is estimated to have been 4311 in 1871; in 1881 it was 5362.

Wanstead is supposed to have been a Roman station. It belonged to the monks of St Peter’s, Westminster, and afterwards to the bishop of London, of whom it was held at Domesday by Ralph Fitz Brien. In the reign of Henry VIII. it came into the possession of the crown, and in 1549 it was bestowed by Edward VI. on Lord Rich, whose son sold it in 1577 to Robert, earl of Leicester. The original manor house was rebuilt by Lord Chancellor Rich, who was here visited by Queen Elizabeth in 1561, and for her entertainment Sir Philip Sidney wrote a dramatic interlude which was played before the queen at Wanstead garden, and is printed at the end of the Arcadia. Sir Richard Child, afterwards earl of Tylney, built the splendid mansion of Wanstead House in 1715 (demolished in 1822), in which the prince of Condé and others of the Bourbon family resided during the reign of the first Napoleon.
