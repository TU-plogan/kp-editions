WENCESLAUS (1361-1419), German king, was the eldest son of the emperor Charles IV., of the house of Luxemburg. He was born in 1361, and when three years of age was crowned as his father’s successor in Bohemia. In 1376 he was elected king of the Romans, and in 1378, on the death of Charles IV., he mounted the Bohemian and German thrones. He repeatedly thought of going to Rome to receive the imperial crown, but this intention was never fulfilled. During his reign there was great confusion both in church and state, and he was wholly powerless to cope with the forces of disorder. Although not without a rude sense of justice, he was of a rough and violent temper, and too fond of pleasure to devote much attention to serious duty. The cities of Germany, in which were some of the best elements of the national life, had been gradually learning how to defend themselves by combining with one another against princes and robber knights; and a wise king or emperor might with their aid have succeeded in re-establishing the authority of the crown. Wenceslaus, however, never understood the importance of the cities, and missed every opportunity of winning their friendship. At a diet in Nuremberg in 1383 an attempt was made to secure the public peace, but the cities, knowing that their liberties were threatened, gave no heed to the measures adopted by the diet. In 1381 the Rhenish cities had formed a confederation, and notwithstanding the threats of Wenceslaus had united with the Swabian League, which was regarded with fear and hatred by most of the southern princes. The battle of Sempach, in which the Swiss confederates gained a decisive victory over the house of Hapsburg, greatly encouraged the cities, but in 1388 a powerful coalition was formed against them, and at the battle of Döffingen their troops suffered so crushing a defeat that they were rendered incapable of further resistance. At a diet held in Eger in 1389 public peace was therefore proclaimed, and the cities of Swabia, the Rhine country, Alsace, the Wetterau, Franconia, and Bavaria were ordered, on pain of the king’s displeasure, to dissolve their alliances. This really meant that the princes had both the king and the towns at their mercy. Wenceslaus was not more successful in his native kingdom Bohemia than in Germany. In 1393, in the course of a struggle with the archbishop of Prague, he shocked both friends and enemies by the murder of the vicargeneral John of Pomuk, who, after being subjected to torture, was bound and thrown into the river Moldau. With all his faults, Wenceslaus was sincerely anxious to check the violence of the Bohemian nobles. They accordingly[9:24:501] plotted against him, and in Jobst of Moravia, to whom Brandenburg had been given in pledge by Sigismund, the brother of Wenceslaus, they found a powerful friend and leader. Wenceslaus was taken prisoner in 1394, and kept for some months in close confinement, and he was set free only when the German princes threatened that if he were detained the conspirators would be treated as enemies of the empire. He was unable to recover more than the appearance of power, and in 1395 he made himself an object of general contempt by selling to John Galeazzo Visconti, of Milan, the dignity of a duke of Lombardy. After the defeat of his brother Sigismund, king of Hungary, at Nicopolis, Wenceslaus came to an understanding with Jobst, to whom he gave Brandenburg in fief; and he afterwards tried to assert authority in Germany by summoning a diet at Frankfort, where, early in 1398, public peace was once more proclaimed. But Wenceslaus could not now undo the results of his indolence and incapacity, and when, in association with the king of France, he supported a plan for the deposition of Popes Boniface IX. and Benedict XIII., and for the assembling of a general council, the spiritual electors and Rupert, elector of the Palatinate, resolved that he himself should be deposed. These electors met at Oberlahnstein, and on the 20th August 1400 a decree depriving Wenceslaus of the German crown was read by the elector of Mainz as chancellor of the empire. The decree was informal, but Wenceslaus was not in a position to set it aside, and Rupert of the Palatinate was elected king in his stead. Fresh troubles had overtaken him in Bohemia, and in 1402 he was made prisoner by his brother Sigismund, who kept him in confinement for nineteen months. After his release he was not less arbitrary than before, and he caused much discontent by encouraging the disciples of Huss, whom he supported, not apparently because he cared for their doctrines, but because he found it convenient to use them as an instrument against the clergy. On the death of Rupert in 1410 Wenceslaus, while retaining the title of king of the Romans, resigned his claims to the imperial dignity in favour of Sigismund, who was elected to the German throne. Wenceslaus died of a stroke of apoplexy on the 16th August 1419.
