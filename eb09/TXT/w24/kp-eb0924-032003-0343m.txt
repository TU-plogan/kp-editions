WALAFRID^[1. In the oldest MSS. this is always spelt “Walahfrid." ] STRABO (or Strabus, i.e., “squint-eyed”) was born in Germany (808-9), but the exact place is unknown. His taste for literature early displayed itself, and by the age of eighteen he had already achieved a reputation among the learned men of his age. He was educated at the monastery of Reichenau, near Constance, where he had for his teachers Tatto and Wettin, to whose visions he devotes one of his poems. Later on in life (c. 826-829) he passed to Fulda, where he studied for some time under Hrabanus Maurus before returning to Reichenau, of which monastery he was made abbot in 838. There is a story, based, however, on no good evidence, that Walafrid devoted himself so closely to letters as to neglect the duties of his office, owing to which he was expelled from his house; but, from his own verses, it seems that the real cause of his flight to Spires was that, notwithstanding the fact that he had been tutor to Charles the Bald, he espoused the side of his elder brother Lothair on the death of Louis the Pious in 840. He was, however, restored to his monastery in 842, and died August 16, 849, on an embassy to his former pupil. His epitaph was written by Hrabanus Maurus, whose elegiacs praise him for being the faithful guardian of his monastery.

Walafrid Strabo’s works may be divided into three classes,— theological, historical, and poetical.

1. The first class includes the Glossa Ordinaria, ^[2. This commentary was the one in general use during the Middle Ages, when it went by the name of Glοssa simply. ] a large commentary on the Bible and part of the Apocrypha. This is of course to a great extent a compilation from St Jerome, St Augustine, St Isidore, Bede, Hrabanus Maurus, &c. Under the same heading come the exposition of the first twenty Psalms, published by Pez (Anecdota Nova, iv.), and an epitome of Hrabanus Maurus’s commentary on Leviticus. An Expositio Quatuor Eνangeliorum is also ascribed to Walafrid. The treatise De Rebus Ecclesiasticis, dedicated to Regenbert the librarian, gives not only explanations and directions for the erection and embellishment of churches, but also instructions as regards such questions as the method of taking the holy communion and the payment of tithes. Walafrid approves of the use of images and pictures in churches, “quia pictura est quaedam literatura illiterata.” He had himself seen “simple folk and idiots,” whom words could hardly bring to a realization of what they were told, so touched by representations of our Lord’s passion that the tears ran down their faces. Last among Walafrid’s theological treatises must be mentioned the De Subversione Jerusalem Tractatus.

2. Walafrid’s chief historical works are—(a ) the Vita Sancti Galli, which, though written nearly two centuries after this saint’s death, is still the primary authority for his life, and (b ) a much shorter life of St Othmar, abbot of St Gall (d. 759). Both these lives were based on previous ones written by Abbot Gotzbert of St Gall (from 816-837).^[3. Walafrid also edited Thetmar’s Life of Louis the Pious, prefixing a preface and making a few additions, and divided Einhard’s Vita Caroli into chapters, adding an introduction. ]

3. Walafrid’s poetical works include a short life of St Blaithmaic, a high-born monk of Iona, murdered by the Danes in the first half of the 9th century; a life of St Mammes; and a Liber de Visionibus Wettin. This last poem, like the two preceding ones written in hexameters, was composed at the command of “Father” Adalgisus, and based upon the prose narrative of Heto, abbot of Reichenau from 806 to 822. It is dedicated to Wettin’s brother Grimald. At the time he sent it to Grimald Walafrid had, as he himself tells us, hardly passed his eighteenth year, and he begs his correspondent to revise his verses, because, “as it is not lawful for a monk to hide anything from his abbot,” he fears he may be beaten with deserved stripes. In this curious vision Wettin saw Charles the Great suffering purgatorial tortures because of his incontinence. The name of the ruler alluded to is not indeed introduced into the actual text, but " Carolus Imperator” form the initial letters of the passage dealing with this subject. Many of Walafrid’s other poems are, or include, short addresses to kings and queens (Lothair, Charles, Louis, Pippin, Judith, &c.) and to friends (Einhard, Grimald, Hrabanus Maurus, Tatto, Ebbo, archbishop of Rheims, Drogo, bishop of Metz, &c.). His most famous poem is the Hortulus, dedicated to Grimald. It is an account of a little garden that he used to tend with his own hands, and is largely made up of [9:24:321] descriptions of the various herbs he grows there and their medicinal and other uses. Sage holds the place of honour; then comes rue, the antidote of poisons; and so on through melons, fennel, lilies, poppies, and many other plants, to wind up with the rose, “which in virtue and scent surpasses all other herbs, and may rightly be called the flower of flowers.” The curious poem De Imagine Tetrici takes the form of a dialogue.
