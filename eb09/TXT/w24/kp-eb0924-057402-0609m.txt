WILLESDEN, a suburb and parish of London, about 4 miles north-west from Hyde Park Corner, is situated on a number of railway lines affording very convenient access to the City. It consists of a number of houses grouped round the parish church of St Mary, Queenstown, a district inhabited chiefly by the working classes; Willesden Green and the outlying hamlets of Brondesbury, Harlesden, Neasdon, Dollis Hill, Stroud Green, and Stonebridge Park are now largely occupied by villas. The church of St Mary, dating probably from the early part of the 14th century, contains some remains of Early English, with a Perpendicular chancel and tower. It was enlarged in 1851 and again in 1872. At Queenstown there are a workingmen’s institute, a workmen’s hall, and a Good Templars’ orphanage. In Willesden Lane there is a Jewish cemetery. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 4383 acres) was 15,869 in 1871 and 27,453 in 1881.

At Domesday the manor of Willesden and Harlesden was held by the canons of St Paul’s. In the 12th century it was formed into eight distinct manors, seven of which are held by the same number of prebendaries. The district is associated with the exploits of Jack Sheppard.
