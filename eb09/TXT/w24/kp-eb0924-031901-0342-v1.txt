WAKEFIELD, Gilbert (1756-1801), classical scholar, theologian, and politician, was born at Nottingham, February 22, 1756, and was the son of the Rev. George Wakefield, rector of St Nicholas. After being educated at various private schools, he proceeded at the age of sixteen to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he cultivated his classical studies diligently, but imbibed a thorough distaste for logic and mathematics. He became, however, fellow of his college in 1776, and in 1778 was ordained by the bishop of Peterborough, in a frame of mind which led him afterwards to declare that he regarded his subscription to the Articles as the most disingenuous action of his life. He held, however, curacies for a short time at Stockport and Liverpool, but in 1779, the year of his marriage, quitted the church, and accepted the post of classical tutor at the Nonconformist academy at Warrington. The institution was already on the decline, and Wakefield’s pugnacious temper was not likely to contribute to restore it. “It survived my arrival,” he says, “four years.” During this short period he published translations of Matthew and the first epistle to the Thessalonians, and treatises on inspiration and baptism, [9:24:320] the latter of which was entirely written in nine days. He apologizes for this precipitancy as the result of “a constitutional ardour which will not suffer me to dwell long on the same subject.” However inevitable, this was the source of most of his failures and mistakes. After the dissolution of the academy, he resided successively at Bramcote in Nottinghamshire, at Richmond, and at Nottingham, taking pupils and persevering in his theological and classical studies, which were considerably retarded by ill health. His most important production at this time was the Silva Critica, “illustrating the Scriptures by light borrowed from the philology of Greece and Rome.” Three parts of this work were printed at the Cambridge university press, but, the authorities declining to proceed further with it, the author was obliged to complete it himself. In 1790 he was appointed professor of classics at the newly-founded Unitarian college at Hackney. Here he speedily became uncomfortable; his proposals for reform in the course of instruction were unacceptable to his colleagues, and his dislike to the religious services, which he carried to the length of objecting to all social worship, occasioned his resignation in June 1791. The publication of his views on public worship deprived him of all his private pupils, and his time was henceforth devoted to authorship and the education of his children. His next important work was a new translation of the New Testament, retaining as much of the language of the Authorized Version as he deemed consistent with accuracy. This soon reached a second edition. He commenced an edition of Pope, which he was prevented from completing by the competition of Warton, but the notes were published separately. His edition of Lucretius, a work of high pretensions and little solid performance, appeared in 1796. It gained for the editor a very exaggerated reputation, but Wakefield suffered himself to be allured from the paths of literature into those of political and religious controversy. After assailing with equal acerbity writers so diverse in their principles as Wilberforce and Thomas Paine, he in January 1798 “employed a few hours” in drawing up a reply to Bishop Watson’s Address to the People of Great Britain. These few hours procured him two years’ imprisonment in Dorchester jail. He was convicted in February 1799 of having published a seditious libel, an offence which he had assuredly no intention of committing, and his eloquent defence was naturally thrown away upon the same jurymen who had already convicted the printer. The sympathy excited for him, however, led to a subscription, amounting to no less than £5000, and forming a sufficient provision for his family upon his death, which occurred September 9, 1801, shortly after his liberation, from an attack of typhus fever. He had occupied himself while in prison with the preparation of classical lectures and an English-Greek lexicon, and had corresponded on classical subjects with Charles James Fox. The letters were subsequently published.

Wakefield was one of the most honest of men, but also one of the most precipitate, narrow-minded, and presumptuous. His extreme ardour and his consciousness of integrity produced an uncharitableness verging on offensiveness, little in harmony with the many magnanimous and amiable features of his character. Rashness, opinionativeness, and contentiousness grievously marred in him the character of patriot and scholar, though they could not destroy his claim to be numbered among both.

The principal authority for his life is the second edition of his Memoirs, in two volumes (London, 1804). The first volume is autobiographical; the second, compiled by the editors, Rutt and Wainwright, includes several estimates of his character and performances from various sources, the most remarkable being one by Dr Parr.
