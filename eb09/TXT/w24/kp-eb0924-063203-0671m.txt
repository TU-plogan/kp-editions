WOLLASTON, William (1659-1724), English philosophical writer, w as born at Coton-Clanford in Staffordshire, March 1659. He was educated under disadvantages both at school and at the university, but left his college (Sidney, Cambridge) with a high reputation for his acquirements, in September 1681. He then became assistant-master of the Birmingham grammar school, and in that position took holy orders. In 1688 an uncle unexpectedly left him an ample fortune, on which he retired, moving to London, where he married a lady of fortune, and devoted himself to his domestic duties and the pursuit of learning and philosophy. In his studies he occupied himself more especially with the foundation of the common doctrines of “natural religion,” which were [9:24:633] in those years so universally discussed. The substance of his thinking on these doctrines he embodied, towards the end of his life, in the one book by which he is now remembered, The Religion of Nature Delineated, the first edition of which was privately printed in 1722, and the second, revised, in 1724. He died in October of the same year.

Wollaston’s Religion of Nature, which falls between Clarke’s Discourse of the Unchangeable Obligations of Natural Religion and. Butler’s Sermons, was one of the popular philosophical books of its day. More than 10,000 copies of it were sold in a few years. It was highly valued by Bishop Butler and a favourite book of Queen Caroline, the wife of George IL, and she ordered the numerous quotations from Latin, Greek, and Hebrew in the notes to be translated into English for her use. To the 8th edition (1750) was added a life of the author. Though the book is now remembered chiefly for the theory of the nature of moral good and evil advocated in it, it was rather its defence of natural religion, and its bold, sometimes original, penetrating, and often eloquent discussion of great ethical religious problems which secured for it “deserved reputation.” It was designed to be an answer to the two questions—Is there such a thing as natural religion? and If there is, what is it? Wollaston starts with the assumption that religion and morality are identical, and labours to show that ι ’ eligion is “the pursuit of happiness by the practice of truth and reason.” The moral theory on which he values himself as propounding a view met with nowhere else is that moral evil is the practical denial of a true proposition and moral good the affirmation of it. To steal is wrong because it is to deny that the thing stolen is what it is—the property of another. In Wollaston’s view “happiness” occupies a large place. He makes pain an evil and pleasure a good. Happiness is a duty and an end to be aimed at by every intelligent being. He makes the production of happiness also the test of the lightness or wrongness of all social regulations. But he admits that in this world happiness and virtue only tend to coincide, and derives from their defective coincidence his argument for a state of future rewards and punishments.

In addition to this work Wollaston published anonymously a small book on the Design of the Book of Ecclesiastes, or the Unreasonableness of Mens Restless Contention for the Present Enjoyments, represented in an English Poem, London, 1691. The subject of the book is sufficiently indicated in its title, and was in form and argument so worthless that its author consulted his reputation by immediately suppressing it. It is now very scarce. The university library of Cambridge possesses a copy.
