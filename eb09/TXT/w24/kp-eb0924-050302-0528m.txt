WESER (O. Germ. Visuracha, Wisura; Lat. Visurgis), one of the chief rivers of Germany, formed by the union of the Werra and the Fulda at Münden, in the Prussian province of Hanover, flows to the north and north-northwest, and entere the North Sea below Bremerhafen, to the east of the Jade Bay. The mouth is 170 miles from Münden, but the winding course of the river is 279 miles long; if the measurement be made from the source of the Werra, in Thuringia, the total length of the stream is 439 miles. At Münden the river surface is 380 feet above sea-level; the most rapid fall in its course is between Carlshafen and Minden in Westphalia, where it descends 70 feet in 20 miles. Nearly the entire course of the Weser lies in Prussia, but it also touches part of Brunswick and Lippe, and after flowing through Bremen expands into an estuary separating the duchy of Oldenburg from the Prussian province of Hanover. Between Münden and Minden its course lies through a series of picturesque valleys flanked by the irregular and disjointed mountain system known as the Weser Hills; but after it emerges from these mountains by the narrow pass called the “Porta Westphalica,” to the north of Minden, its banks become flat and uninteresting. The breadth of the river varies from 110 yards at Münden to 220 yards at Minden, 250 yards at Bremen, 1¼ miles at Elsfleth, and 7½ miles at its entrance into the sea. The Weser on the whole is shallow; and navigation on the upper Weser, i.e., above Bremen, is sometimes interrupted for months by drought. Sea-going ships may ascend to Elsfleth, though Bremerhafen is the chief port for large vessels; smaller craft may reach Vegesack, and barges of 200 tons make their way to Münden. The stream discharges itself into the sea amid sandbanks, which leave only a single narrow fairway, 19-22 feet deep at high water and 12 feet at low water; on the upper Weser the navigation of the only available narrow channel, which is interrupted by occasional rapids, is assisted by locks and weirs. The Weser drains a basin estimated at 18,360 square miles. Its principal tributaries on the right are the Aller, Wümme, Drepte, Lune, and Geeste, and on the left the Diemel, Nethe, Emmer, Werre, Aue, and Hunte. The Werra and Fulda are both navigable when they unite to form the Weser; the Aller, Wümme, Geeste, and Hunte are also navigable. Beyond the junction of the Hunte the Weser, hitherto a single stream, is divided into several channels by islands.

The navigation of the Weser was long hampered by the various and vexatious claims and rights of the different states through whose territories it ran. Before 1866 the joint stream, including the Werra and the Fulda, changed its ruler no less than thirty-five times on its way to the sea. In 1823, however, a treaty was made establishing a fixed toll and a uniform system of management; this was further improved in 1856 and 1865; and when Prussia took possession of Hanover and Hesse-Nassau in 1866 the chief difficulties in the way of organizing the river-trade disappeared. The principal town on the Weser is Bremen (population in 1885, 118,043). Other towns past which it flows betwixt Münden and the sea are Carlshafen, Höxter, Holzminden, Bodenwerder, Hameln, Rinteln, Vlotho, Minden, Nienburg, Vegesack, Elsfleth, Braake, Blexen, Geestemünde, and Bremerhafen. The Weser gave name to a department in the short-lived kingdom of Westphalia; the chief town was Osnabrück. A canal between the Wümme and the Oste, and another between the Geeste and the mouth of the Elbe, connect the Weser system with that of the Elbe. A canal is also being constructed from the Hunte to a tributary of the Ems.
