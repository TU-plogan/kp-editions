WELLINGTON, a town of Shropshire, England, on the Great Western and London and North-Western railway lines, and on the Shropshire Union Canal, 151 ¼ miles north-west of London, 11 east of Shrewsbury, and 31 north-west of Birmingham. The neighbourhood is picturesque, the Wrekin, about 1½ miles from the town, rising to a height of 1320 feet. The church of All Saints, built in 1790, was restored in 1876, and again in 1883. There are a number of charities. The manufacture of agricultural implements, iron and brass founding, and malting are carried on. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 352 acres) in 1871 was 5926, and in 1881 it was 6217.

Wellington, which is situated near the old Roman Watling Street, is referred to in Domesday as held by Earl Roger. It was granted by King John to Thomas de Erdinton for services rendered at Rome at the time of the interdict. It was held by Earl Edwin, but by the rebellion of Robert de Belesme was forfeited to the king. The church of Wellington was given by Earl Roger to Shrewsbury abbey. Wellington was the first rendezvous of Charles I., who on 19th September 1642 mustered his forces near the town.
