WOBURN, a town of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, United States, lies about 10 miles somewhat west of north from Boston; it comprises within its limits four villages of greater or less size, besides a small rural population. The town contains 75 miles of streets. The population in 1885 was 11,750, about three-tenths of foreign birth. The [9:24:626] industries, which are largely manufacturing, are connected chiefly with the tanning of leather and the making of boots and shoes.

Woburn is one of the older towns of Massachusetts, having been settled in 1642. Its growth, however, was slow, and it is only in recent years that it has attained to importance.
