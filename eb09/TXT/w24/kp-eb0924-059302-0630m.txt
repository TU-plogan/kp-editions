WILTS, a south-western county of England, is bounded N.W. and N. by Gloucestershire, E. by Berks and Hants, S. by Hants and Dorset, and W. by Somerset. It is of an irregular oval form, its greatest length from north to south being 54 miles and its greatest breadth from east to west 37. The area is 866,677 acres, or about 1354 square miles.

About two-thirds of the surface of Wilts is occupied by a great Chalk upland, embracing the greater part of the wild wooded tract of Cranborne Chase, the undulating elevation of Salisbury Plain, and the hilly district of the Marlborough Downs, with Savernake Forest. In some cases the Chalk rises into steep escarpments; and the scenery of the north-western region, bordering on the lower ground, is varied and picturesque. A large portion of the Chalk region is over 600 feet above sea-level, and several summits have an elevation of over 900 feet, the highest being Inkpen Beacon (1011 feet) at the junction of Wilts, Hants, and Berks. Scattered over the surface of the northern downs are huge blocks of silicious Tertiary grits, called sarsen stones or grey wethers, which have been used in the formation of the Druidical circles of Stonehenge and Avebury. The underlying Greensand is exposed in the deep valleys of the Chalk, especially in the broad vale of Pewsey, separating the Marlborough Downs from Salisbury Plain. It also appears as a narrow fringe between the Chalk and Oolite formations on the north and west, and in Alfred’s Tower near Stourton on the Somersetshire border reaches an elevation of 800 feet. Outliers of the London Clay cap some of the hills in the neighbourhood of Great and Little Bedwin and Savernake Forest; and the clays and sands of the Woolwich and Reading beds appear in the south-eastern extremity of the county. About a third of the surface of the county, to the north-west of the Chalk, including a portion of the White Horse Vale, consists mainly of Oolite limestones and clays resting chiefly on the Greensand. The Lower, Middle, and Upper varieties are all represented. At one time the fuller’s earth of the Lower Oolite was dug for use in the cloth-mills. In the Coral Rag of the Middle Oolite a useful bed of iron is wrought near Westbury, the annual output of ore varying in value from £12,000 to £20,000. The valuable Portland stone of the Upper Oolite is quarried for building purposes at Chilmark, Tisbury, and Swindon, and the famous Bath stone of the Great Oolite is obtained at Corsham and Box on the Somersetshire border. The Oolite yields a variety of interesting fossils: the pear encrinite (Apwcrinites rotundus) is found in the Bradford clay; many fine corals are obtained in the Coral Rag; and Isastraea oblonga is very plentiful at Tisbury.

One of the most charming features of Wilts is its rich and finely wooded valleys. The three principal rivers are the Kennet, the Lower or Bristol Avon, and the Southern or Christchurch Avon. The Kennet, rising in the Marlborough Downs, winds eastwards past Marlborough and Hungerford into Berkshire, to join the Thames at Reading. The Lower Avon, which rises in Gloucestershire, flows southwards by Malmesbury, Chippenham, Melksham, and Bradford, where it bends north-westwards into Somersetshire. Besides several smaller streams, it receives from the south the Frome, which forms for a short distance the boundary between Wilts and Somersetshire. The Southern Avon, which rises near Bishop’s Cannings in the centre of the county, flows southwards by Amesbury and Salisbury into Hants. At Salisbury it receives from the west the Nadder, after its junction with the Wily at Wilton, and from the north-east the Bourne. The Thames skirts the north-eastern border of the county.

Agriculture.— According to returns made on 4th June 1887, the total area of land occupied was 759,538 acres, of which 646,653 were rented and 112,885 owned and occupied; 759,412 acres, or about seven-eighths of the whole area, were under cultivation. Of this area 395,010 acres were permanent pasture, a great portion consisting of sheep-runs on the Chalk downs. In some places, especially in Salisbury Plain, tillage was in former years extensively introduced in the Chalk districts, but much of this has again reverted to pasture. There were 174,876 acres under corn crops, 99,388 under green crops, 79,049 under rotation grasses, and 11,086 under fallow. In north-west Wilts the prevailing soil is a reddish chalky clay resting on a subsoil of broken stones, whilst on the Chalk formation the arable land is of a lighter character. There are also extensive tracts of richer soil well adapted for wheat and beans. In 1887 wheat occupied 67,357 acres, barley 50,928, oats 44,047, rye 1728, beans 7274, and pease 3542. The bulk of the green crops are grown for the feeding of cattle and sheep, potatoes occupying only 3339 acres and carrots 237, while 54,869 acres were under turnips and swedes, 5673 mangold, 10,473 cabbage, rape, &c., and 24,527 vetches, &c. The total area under nursery grounds in 1887 was 91 acres, while market gardens occupied 3525, and orchards 3346. Woods in 1881 occupied 45,270 acres, a great part being comprised in the ancient forests, including Cranborne Chase and Savernake Forest, which contain some remarkable old oaks and beeches. The number of horses in 1887 was 23,616, of which 18,980 were used solely for purposes of agriculture. Cattle numbered 106,020, 60,113 being cows and heifers in milk or in calf. Dairy farming is the leading industry in the north-western districts, Wiltshire being famous for its cheese. Of the cattle 15,505 were two years and above, and 30,402 under two years, an indication that comparatively few cattle are kept for purposes of feeding. Sheep in 1887 numbered 643,125, and pigs 66,422.

According to the latest landowners’ Return, Wiltshire was divided among 14,013 owners, possessing 828,949 acres at an annual valuation of £1,599,239, or about £1, 18s. 7d. per acre. There were 9635 owners possessing less than one acre each, 1519 acres being divided amongst them. The estimated extent of commons or waste lands was 1931 acres. The following proprietors owned over 7000 acres each :—earl of Pembroke, 39,601 acres; marquis of Ailesbury, 37,994; marquis of Bath, 19,978; earl of Radnor, 17,173; Simon W. Taylor, 14,960; R. P. Long, 13,618; Sir John Neeld, 13,113; trustees of Sir H. Meux, 11,896; marquis of Lansdowne, 11,146; earl of Suffolk, 11,098; earl of Normanton, 9812; Lord Ashburton, 9592; Sir E. Antrobus, 8374; Sir Francis D. Astley, 7888; Sir Μ. E. Hicks Beach, 7200; and T. Fraser Grove, 7179.

Communication.—k considerable amount of traffic is carried on in the northern districts by means of canals. The Thames and Severn Canal crosses the north-west comer of the county. Between Cricklade and Swindon it is joined by a branch canal to the Wilts and Berks Canal. This last has a semicircular course southwestwards by Swindon, Wootton Basset, and Melksham, 2 miles beyond which it is joined by the Rennet and Avon Canal, which crosses the centre of the county by Hungerford, Devizes, and Bradford. The railway communication is supplied chiefly by the Great Western and the London and South Western lines.

Manufactures and Trade.— Wiltshire has long been celebrated for its cloths, the chief seats of the industry being Bradford and Trowbridge, while among other places Melksham and Chippenham are perhaps the most important. Wilton is still celebrated for its carpets.. Haircloth weaving and the manufacture of cocoa-nut fibres are carried on at Melksham, and there are silk works at Chippenham, Malmesbury, Mere, and Warminster. Iron-smelting from the mines of the neighbourhood is carried on at Westbury; portable engines are made at Devizes; and at Swindon are the enginee rin g works of the Great·Western Railway. Various towns are associated with different branches of the agricultural trade: Salisbury and Devizes have important corn markets; Chippenham, besides a trade in cheese, has a condensed milk manufactory; Wilton has a large sheep fair; and Caine is the centre of the Wiltshire bacon trade.

Administration and Population.— Wiltshire comprises 29 hundreds, the city of Salisbury or New Sarum (population 14,792 in 1881), and the municipal boroughs of Caine (2474), Chippenham (1352), Devizes (6645), and Marlborough (3343). The county has one court of quarter sessions and is divided into fifteen petty sessional divisions. The city of Salisbury and the borough of Devizes have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions, and the borough of Marlborough has a commission of the peace. Previous to the Act of 1885 the county was divided for parliamentary purposes into North and South Wilts, each returning two members, and included the following parliamentary boroughs—Caine, Chippenham, part of Cricklade, Devizes, Malmesbury, Marlborough, Salisbury city, part of Shaftesbury, Westbury, and Wilton. All these returned one member each, with the exception of Salisbury, which returned two; by the Act of 1885 they were all merged in the county divisions, with the exception of Salisbury, which was deprived of one member. The county was reformed into five parliamentary divisions, each returning one member,—north (Cricklade), into which the Wiltshire portion of Cricklade is merged; north-west (Chippenham), into which Chippenham and Malmesbury are merged; south (Wilton), into which Wilton is merged; east (Devizes), into which Devizes and Marlborough are merged; and west (Westbury), into which Westbury is merged. The county contains 340 civil parishes, with parts of seven others. It is mostly in the diocese of Salisbury. From 183,820 in 1801 the population by 1821 had increased to 219,574, and by 1841 to 256,280, and, although by 1861 it had diminished to 249,311, by 1871 it had again increased to 257,177; in 1881 it was 258,965, of whom 128,114 were males and 130,851 females. The number of persons to an acre is 0 - 30 and of acres to a person 3 - 35.

History and Antiquities. — In the importance of its early archaeo- 1ogical remains Wilts takes a foremost place among the counties of England. In the river gravel-beds near Salisbury and elsewhere several specimens of flint implements of the Palaeolithic age have been dug up, and the numerous barrows of the Chalk downs have yielded a great variety of stone implements of the Neolithic age, as well as of a later period. The ancient British boundary, the Wans Dyke, passed westwards across the county from Great Bedwin; west of Marlborough it still remains for many miles in a perfect condition. Traces of several other boundaries of a somewhat similar character are met with in other parts of the county. The British “ridgeway” runs north-eastwards from Avebury, near the tumulus of Silbury Hill, to the ancient forts of Barbury and Bad bury; other ancient British trackways have been converted into Roman roads. Among the principal ancient defensive works are Battlesbury and Scratchbury near Warminster; the entrenchments of Barbury and Badbury; Bratton, near Westbury, defended by double ramparts, in some places 36 feet in height, to which Guthrum the Dane is said to have retreated after his defeat by King Alfred; Casterly, on a ridgeway about 7 miles south-east of Devizes, described by Sir R. C. Hoare as “one of the most original and unaltered works of the British era which our country can produce”; Figbury Ring, 3 miles north-east of Salisbury, sometimes called Chlorus’s camp, from the tradition that it was made by the British general Constantine Chlorus; Sidbury, 3 miles south-west of Collingbourne, probably an ancient British town; Vespasian’s camp, between Amesbury and Stonehenge; and Yarnbury camp, in very perfect preservation, to the north of Wily. Ogbury camp, 6 miles north of Salisbury, is an undoubted British entrenchment, but probably a sheep-fold. The stone circles of Avebury and Stonehenge are the most remarkable megalithic structures in the kingdom; but their origin and date are the subject of much dispute. Durrington “walls,” north of Amesbury, are probably the remains of a British village; there are also traces of others at several places on the slopes of the Marlborough Downs and Salisbury Plain.

There are no records of the Roman invasion, though many evi-detíces of Roman occupation remain. The ancient Fosse Way crossed the north-west corner of the county from Bath to Cirencester. From this last town another road passed southwards to Cunetro (Folly Farm near Marlborough), joining the Via Julia, which crossed the county from Bath to Silchester. From Salisbury one went north-east to Silchester, another east to Winchester, and another north-west to Bath. On the line of these roads remains of Roman villages have been found at different places.

After the departure of the Romans Wilts was the scene of frequent contests, first between the Britons and the Saxons and afterwards between the Saxons and the Danes. Badbury is the reputed Mons Badonieus where King Arthur defeated Cerdic in 520. In 552 Cynric inflicted a severe defeat on a large army of Britons at Old Sarum, and in 556, after a great victory over them at Barbury Hill, he incorporated the country of the Wilsaetas in the kingdom [9:24:595] of Wessex. In 823 Egbert, king of the West Saxons, gained a victory over Beornwulf, king of Mercia, at Ellandune near Wilton. Wilton itself was the scene of Alfred’s defeat by the Danes in 871. In 878 the Danes plundered Chippenham, where Alfred had one of his residences, and made the town their headquarters; but afterwards Alfred inflicted on Guthrum such a severe defeat at Ethan-dune (supposed to be Edington near Westbury) that the Danes came to terms with him, the south-western part of Mercia being henceforth held by the Saxons and the north-eastern by the Danes. During the Danish invasions at the close of the 10th and the beginning of the 11th century the district was overrun by Sweyn, who pillaged and burned Wilton, as well as Old Sarum. At the latter town Canute died in 1036. During the conflict between Stephen and Matilda the strongholds of Sarum, Devizes, and Malmesbury were held by Bishop Roger for Matilda, until he was compelled to surrender them. During the Civil War Wiltshire sided chiefly with the Parliament. In 1643 Wardour Castle near Tisbury was bravely defended by Lady Blanche Arundell against Sir Edward Hungerford, and, although she was forced to capitulate, the castle was again taken by her son in 1645. In 1643 Essex was routed by Charles I. and Rupert at Aidbourn, and the same year Waller was defeated by Wilmot at Roundaway near Devizes. After the storming of Devizes Castle by Cromwell in September 1645 the Cavaliers were wholly driven from the county.

The church of St Lawrence, Bradford, converted at one time into cottages, is one of the most perfect specimens of ancient Saxon architecture existing; and there is also Saxon work in the churches of Britford (north and south door), Burcombe (east end of the chancel), Manningford Bruce, and a few other places. There is a large amount of Roman work in the church of Malmesbury abbey, much of it, however, being Transition; the church of St John’s, Devizes, retains its original Norman tower and exhibits Norman vaulting in the chancel; the chancel of St Mary’s in the same town is also Norman, and its porch has characteristic Norman mouldings; the churches of Preshute and Corsham contain interesting examples of the same style. Salisbury cathedral is the finest and most perfect example of Early English existing; and there is much good architecture of the same style in the churches of Amesbury, Bishop’s Cannings, Cricklade, Collingbourne-Kingston, Downton, Edington, and Purton. The prevailing architecture is, however, Perpendicular, of which there are numerous fine examples, especially in the districts where good building stone is found; but in the Chalk districts, where the churches are constructed of flint, the architecture is generally inferior. There are numerous interesting examples of domestic architecture of the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries. The only monastic remains of importance within the county are the abbey church of Malmesbury; the picturesque ruins of Lacock or Laycock abbey (3 miles south of Chippenham), founded in 1232 by Ella, countess of Salisbury; the walls of Bradenstoke priory (northeast of Chippenham), founded in 1142 by Walter d’Evreux for Augustinian canons, now converted into a farmhouse; and slight remains of the Cluniae priory of Monkton-Farleigh, founded in 1125. The fortress of Old Sarum is almost completely demolished, but tho outlines of the defences remain; Devizes retains a few fragments, “built up again,” according to Freeman, as “meaningless ornaments in the midst of the most fearful piece of modern gim-crack that human eyes ever beheld”; and the mound of Marlborough has been made into a “hill of pleasure.” Trowbridge Castle, which was held for Matilda by Humphrey de Bohun, has completely disappeared, its site being occupied by modern buildings; and only a few small fragments remain of Ludgershall, which Matilda occupied on her escape from Winchester.

Wilts has an unusually long roll of illustrious persons. Among divines, Hugh Latimer was rector of West Kington; Richard Hooker was rector of Boscombe; George Crabbe was for eighteen years rector of Trowbridge, and was buried in the chancel of the church; Dr Henry Sacheverell was the son of a Marlborough clergyman; George Herbert and Archdeacon William Coxe were both rectors of Bemerton (near Salisbury); and Dr Joshua Marshman, the Indian missionary, was born at Westbury. Of persons who have distinguished themselves in some form of literature we may mention Thomas Chubb, the Deist, who was a native of Harnham; Hobbes of Malmesbury; Philip Massinger, who was born at Salisbury; Joseph Addison, the son of the rector of Milston; Bryan Edwards, the historian; Aubrey and Britton, the antiquaries; Edmund Ludlow, author of the Memoirs of the Restoration period; and Sir R. Colt Hoare, the historian of Wilts. Statesmen are represented by “Orator” Hunt, Sir John Davies, Bolingbroke, Hyde first earl of Clarendon, Harris first earl of Malmesbury, Fox first Lord Holland, Protector Somerset, and Henry Fawcett. Other persons of special distinction are Sir Christopher Wren, Sir B. Collins Brodie, and Thomas Willis, one of the founders of the Royal Society.
