WEST BROMWICH, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Staffordshire, England, is situated near the river Tame, and on the Great Western Railway, 6 miles north-west of Birmingham, and 133¾ miles from London. It consists chiefly of one main street, the High Street, upwards of 1½ miles in length. The parish church (All Saints, formerly St Clement’s) is of very early origin, and was given by Henry I. to the convent of Worcester, which subsequently gave it to the priory of Sandwell. The present church, a handsome structure in the Decorated style, was built in 1871-72. The principal other public buildings are the West Bromwich district hospital (erected in 1867 at a cost of £9000, and enlarged in 1882 at a cost of £4000), the town-hall and municipal offices (1875), the market-hall, the free library (1874), and the Liberal club (1884). There are two public charities—the Stanley (1613) and the Whorwood (1614). Since 1880 the town has manufactured its own gas, but the water is supplied by the South Staffordshire Waterworks Company. There are several large foundries, smelting-furnaces, and forges, but the staple manufactures are the various kinds of implements of wrought-iron used for household, agricultural, or mechanical purposes. The town also possesses brass foundries, maltings, limekilns, aud brickyards. There are large collieries in the neighbourhood. The area of the municipal and parliamentary borough and urban sanitary district is 5719 acres, with a population in 1871 of 47,918 and in 1881 of 56,295.

In 1230 the manor of West Bromwich was vested in the barons of Dudley, and in 1293 it descended to Walter de Evereus; in 1448 it passed to the Stanleys, from whom it was purchased by Sir Richard Skelton, solicitor-general to Charles I.; and in 1626 it came into the possession of Sir Samuel Clarke, by whose descendants, who subsequently assumed the name of Clarke-Jervoise, it was sold in 1823 to the earl of Dartmouth. West Bromwich was incorporated 13th September 1882. By the Act of 1885 its parliamentary representation was separated from that of Wednesbury, and it was erected into a parliamentary borough returning one member.
