WALTHAMSTOW, a town of Essex, England, now practically a suburb of London, is situated a short distance east of the river Lea, on a branch of the Great Eastern Railway, 6 miles north of Liverpool Street station. The original village grouped round the church is of comparatively small dimensions, but a large number of houses and villas have been built along the high road, from which diverge a number of streets and “ends.” The church of St Mary existed at a very early period, but the present building, chiefly of brick, was erected in 1535 by Sir George Monoux, lord mayor of London, and has undergone frequent alteration and improvement. Besides other old brasses it contains in the north aisle the effigies in brass of Sir George Monoux and Anne his wife. Among the other public buildings are the town hall, erected in 1876 at a cost of £4500, the literary institute, founded in 1882, and the working men’s club and institute. There are a number of educational institutions, including a school of art connected with the science and art department of South Kensington, the Monoux grammar school, the Forest school, founded in 1834 in connexion with King’s College, and the home for orphan boys. The benevolent and charitable institutions include the public dispensary (1873), the Leyton and Walthamstow hospital home for children (1877), Sir George Monoux’s almshouses for thirteen poor men (1527), the Collard almshouses for ten married couples (1851), and the Squire almshouses for widows of decayed tradesmen. In the vicinity are the reservoirs of the East London Waterworks Company. On the banks of the Lea there are flour-mills and an oil-mill. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 4374 acres) in 1871 was 10,692, and in 1881 it was 21,715.

In Domesday the name occurs as Welamestun. In the reign of Edward the Confessor it belonged to Waltheof, son of Siward, earl of Northumberland, who married Judith, niece of the Conqueror, who betrayed him to his death in 1075. The estate subsequently passed to Guy de Beauchamp, earl of Warwick, and on the attainder of Earl Thomas in 1396 reverted to the crown. Afterwards it came into the possession of Edmund Beaufort, duke of Somerset; from the Somersets it passed to Sir George Rodney, and subsequently it came to the Maynard family. It is supposed to have been the birthplace of George Gascoigne the poet (d. 1577). Sir William Patten, commissioner of the navy, the friend of Pepys, had his seat at Walthamstow, and was frequently visited there by Pepys.
