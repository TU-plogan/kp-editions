WÚN, a British district in the chief commissionership of Berar, lying between 19° 46' and 20° 42' N. lat. and between 77° 26' and 79° 10' E. long., and containing an area of 3907 square miles. It is bounded on the N. and W. by Amraoti and Basim districts, on the S. by the Nizam’s Dominions, and on the E. by Wardhá and Chándá districts of the Central Provinces. Wún is a wild hilly country intersected by offshoots from the Ajanta chain of mountains. For the most part the hills in the district are bare, or clothed only with dwarf teak or small jungle; but on the heights near Wún town the bamboo grows abundantly, and elsewhere small bamboos are found in the ravines. The Wardhá and Paingangá, which bound the district on the east and south, unite at its south-east corner. The Paingangá carries off nearly all the drainage of the district. Wún is rich in coal and iron ores. Of wild animals the tiger, leopard, and hyaena abound; bears, wolves, and jackals are also numerous; while small game is plentiful in all parts. There is a great want of means of communication; during the rains cart traffic is entirely suspended, the only means of transit at this time of the year being that afforded by water from the Wardhá for a short distance. The climate is enervating and unhealthy, and the average annual rainfall is about 41 inches.

Wúu district forms part of the territory assigned by the nizam to the British. Government under the treaties of 1853 and 1860. It was undisturbed during the mutiny of 1857. In 1886-87 the gross revenue amounted to £86,174, of which the land contributed £57,391. The population in 1881 was 392,102 (males 201,491, females 190,611); Hindus numbered 335,787, Mohammedans 17,031, Christians 127, and aboriginals 37,252. Wún, the chief town of the district (population 4207), has some fine temples.
