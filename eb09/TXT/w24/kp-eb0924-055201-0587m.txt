WHITEFISH is a collective name applied in different countries to very different kinds of freshwater fishes, which, however, have this in common, that their body is covered with regularly arranged silvery scales, without spots or ornamental colours. Thus the numerous European species of the Cyprinoid genus Leuciscus are frequently comprised under the name of “Whitefish,” whilst in North America this term is in general use for the various species of the Salmonoid genus Coregonus, which abound in every lake and river of Canada and the northern parts of the United States.
