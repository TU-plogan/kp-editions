WORTHING, a watering-place of Sussex, is situated on the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, 61 miles south of London and 10∣ west of Brighton. On account of its sheltered situation at the foot of the South Downs it has some reputation as a health-resort for pulmonary complaints. As a general sea-side resort it is increasing in favour, especially with the wealthier classes. There is a marine parade 1∣ mile in length, a long range of firm sands, and an iron promenade pier, 960 feet in length, constructed in 1882. A public park, 21 acres in extent, was opened in 1881. The churches and chapels are all modern. The other principal buildings are the town-hall (1834), a quadrangular structure with square clock tower, Montague hall, the literary institute, the workmen’s institute, the infirmary and dispensary (1882), the Thomas Banting memorial convalescent home, the public baths, erected in 1886, Humphrey’s almshouses, and Queen Elizabeth’s almshouses. The mother parish of Worthing is Broadwater, the church of which, three-quarters of a mile north of Worthing, a cruciform building in the Transition style, has some old monuments and brasses. The population of the urban sanitary district (979 acres) was 7401 in 1871, and 10,976 in 1881.

Pottery and other Roman remains have been found at Worthing. In Domesday the manor appears under the name of Ordinges, and consisted of eleven hides, or about 110 acres. In the reign of Edward I. it was valued at 100 shillings. It formed part of the endowment of the priory of Easebourne, near Midhurst, and at the Reformation was granted with other possessions to Henry Fitzwilliam, earl of Southampton. It afterwards passed through several hands to the earl of Warwick. It was of some importance in the reign of Edward III., who granted it the privilege of a market, but it declined to a poor fishing hamlet. Its rise as a watering place began about 1760, and after a visit of the Princess Amelia in 1797 it made rapid progress.
