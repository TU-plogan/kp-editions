WITTEN, a rapidly growing town of Westphalia, Prussia, is favourably situated among the coalfields of the Ruhr, 14 miles east of Essen and 15 miles northeast of Elberfeld. The coal-mines in the neighbourhood provide abundant fuel for large cast-steel works, iron-foundries, railway workshops, machinery and boiler works, glass-works, distilleries, and other industrial establishments. In 1843 the population was 3444; in 1885 it was 23,903.
