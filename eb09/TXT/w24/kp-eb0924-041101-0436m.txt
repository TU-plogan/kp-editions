WATERTOWN, a city in Jefferson and Dodge counties, Wisconsin, United States, is situated upon both sides of Rock river, in a rich farming region. Its population in 1880 was 7883, 3072 of them of foreign birth. The river furnishes a valuable water-power for extensive manufactures. Watertown contains the North-Western University, a Lutheran institution, and a Roman Catholic seminary. About two-thirds of the present population are Germans or their direct descendants.
