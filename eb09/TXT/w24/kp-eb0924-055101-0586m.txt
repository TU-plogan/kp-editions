WHITEFIELD, or Stand, a large manufacturing village of Lancashire, England, in the township of Pilkington, is situated a short distance from the Radcliffe Bridge station on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 5âˆ£ miles north of Manchester and 196 from London. It possesses a number of fine villas inhabited by Manchester merchants. The church of All Saints, commonly called Stand church, was erected in 1826 from the designs of Sir Charles Barry. There is a school founded and endowed by Henry Siddal in 1688. Whitefield has risen into importance since 1829. There are coal mines in the neighbourhood, and cottonspinning and hand and power loom weaving are carried on. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 2048 acres) was 9054 in 1871 and 9516 in 1881.

A family of the name of Pilkington was settled at Pilkington Tower or Stand soon after the Conquest, Leonard Pilkington being mentioned as lord of the manor in the tenth year of Henry I. The manor of Pilkington was granted to the earl of Derby by Henry VII. after the battle of Bosworth. The old hall of the Pilkington family, called Stand Hall, existed as recently as 1848. On the foundation stone was the date 1580.
