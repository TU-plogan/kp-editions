WISMAR, the second commercial town and seaport of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Germany, is situated on the Bay of Wismar, one of the best harbours on the Baltic, 18 miles almost due north of Schwerin. The town is well and regularly built, with broad and straight streets, and contains numerous handsome and quaint buildings in the northern Gothic style. The church of St Mary, a Gothic edifice of 1353, with a tower 260 feet high, and the church of St Nicholas (1381-1460), with very lofty vaulting, are regarded as good examples of the influence exercised in these northern provinces by the large church of St Mary in Lübeck. The elegant cruciform church of St George dates from the 14th and 15th centuries. The Fürstenhof, at one time a ducal residence but now occupied by the municipal authorities, is a richly decorated specimen of German Renaissance. Built in 1554, it was restored in 1877-79. The “Old School,” dating from about 1300, has been restored, and is now occupied as a museum. The chief manufactures of Wismar are iron, chicory, cigars, roofing-felt, asphalt, &c. Fishing and agriculture are carried on by the inhabitants, but their main industry is connected with shipping and trade. The leading exports are grain, oil-seeds, butter, and cattle; the imports are coal, timber, iron, stoneware, and lime. The harbour is deep enough to admit vessels of 16-feet draught. In

1886 the port owned 35 ships (2 steamers), of 8302 tons burden; in 1875, however, it had 46 ships, with a total burden of 10,447 tons. The population, 6009 in 1810 and 14,462 in 1875, was 16,011 in 1885.

Wismar is said to have received town-rights in 1229. In the 13th and 14th centuries it was a flourishing Hanse town, with important woollen factories. Though a plague carried off 10,000 of the inhabitants in 1376, the town seems to have remained tolerably prosperous until the 16th century. By the peace of Westphalia in 1649 it passed to Sweden, along with a barony to which it gives name. In 1803 Sweden pledged both town and barony to Mecklenburg for a sum of money, reserving, however, the right of redemption after 100 years. In view of this contingent right of Sweden, Wismar is not represented in the diet of Mecklenburg; but it still enjoys some of its ancient rights and privileges as a free town.
