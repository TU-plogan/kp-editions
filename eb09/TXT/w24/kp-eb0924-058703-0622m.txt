WILLIMANTIC, a borough in the town of Windham, Windham county, Connecticut, United States, is situated in a broken hilly country, on the Westfield river and on three railway lines,â€”the New York and New England, the New York, New Haven, and Hartford, and the Central Vermont. The population in 1880 was 6608. The industries consist chiefly of cotton manufactures, in which the town has acquired great prominence, owing to the fine water power afforded by the Westfield river.
