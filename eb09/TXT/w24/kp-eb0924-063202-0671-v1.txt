WOLFRAM VON ESCHENBACH, mediaeval German poet, lived in the latter part of the 12th and the early part of the 13th century. Little is known about the facts of his life, and such knowledge as we possess is derived wholly from his own writings. He belonged to a poor but noble family. He speaks of himself as a Bavarian, and refers to the count of Wertheim as his feudal lord. His home was the castle of Eschenbach (near Ansbach), and in the churchyard at Eschenbach what was said to be his grave was shown as late as the beginning of the 17th century. He spent some time at the court of Hermann, landgrave of Thuringia, where he met Walther von der Vogel weide, to whom he makes two references in his works. Wolfram survived Hermann, who died in 1216. His residence at the Thuringian court led to his being included among the poets who were afterwards said to have taken part in a great competition for poetic supremacy at the Wartburg. Wolfram seems to have been happily married, and to have had children. In politics he was a supporter of the emperor Otho IV. He understood French, but could neither read nor write.

His greatest work is Parzival, an epic poem completed between 1205 and 1215. It combines the story of the Holy Grail with incidents from the legends of southern France about the old princes of Anjou and from the legendary history of Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. To Wolfram’s contemporary, Gottfried of Strasburg, the style of this poem seemed abstract and obscure; aud Parzival certainly lacks the lightness and grace of Gottfried’s masterpiece Tristan. It has, however, high imaginative qualities, and, regarded as a whole, is the most splendid achievement in the literature of Germany during the period of Middle High German. Even in Wolfram’s day the poem produced a profound impression, and in the 15th century it was still so warmly appreciated that it was one of the earliest works made accessible to the public through the invention of printing. The principal authority used by Wolfram seems to have been the Conte del Gral of Chrestien de Troyes. He mentions, besides this work, a poem by Kiot, a Provençal poet; but nothing is known of Kiot, and it may be that he never really existed. Whatever may have been the sources of Parzival, Wolfram gave to everything he borrowed from others a wholly new character, impressing upon it strongly the mark of his own great ideal spirit. Besides his chief work and various lyrics he composed two epic fragments, Titurel and Willehalm, the former before Parzival, the latter after. Titurel, a love-tale, belongs to the same cycle of legends as the story of Parzival, and, so far as form is concerned, it is the brightest and most artistic of Wolfram’s works. Willehalm presents the legendary history of St William of Orange, a contemporary of Charlemagne. The so-called third part of this poem was continued by Ulrich von Tiir-heim about 1250, the first part by Ulrich von dem Tiirlin between 1252 and 1278.

A complete edition of wolfram’s works was issued by Lachmann in 1833. Bartsch afterwards published, with notes, an edition of Ραrzirαl and Titurel. There are renderings into modern German by San-Marte and Simrock. See San-Marte’s Parziυal-Studieη, and essays by Bartsch, Pfeiffer, Rochat, and Zingerle in Pfeiffer’s Germania.
