WICK, a royal and parliamentary burgh and seaport of Scotland, the county town of Caithness, is situated on the German Ocean at the head of Wick Bay and at the eastern terminus of the Sutherland and Caithness section of the Highland Railway, 374 miles north of Edinburgh by rail and 18∣ south of John O’Groat’s House. It consists of the old burgh of Wick on the north bank of the river, Louisburgh, a northern continuation of Wick, and Pultney-town, the chief seat of commerce and trade, on the south side of the river. Pultneytown, laid out in 1805 by the British Fishery Society, is built on a regular plan; and Wick proper consists chiefly of the narrow and irregular High Street, off which is the temperance hall, with Bridge Street, somewhat more regularly built, and containing the town-hall and the county buildings. In Pultneytown there are an academy, a chamber of commerce, a naval reserve station, and a fish exchange. The port consists of two harbours of fair size; but the entrance is dangerous in stormy weather. Several expensive schemes for constructing a breakwater have resulted in disastrous failure. In 1886 the number of vessels that entered the port was 1128 of 109,142 tons, the number that cleared 1094 of 103,162 tons. The average value of the exports for the five years ending 1887 was about £150,000; but in 1886 it was only £89,641. The chief exports are fish, cattle, and agricultural produce, and the imports include coal, wood, and provisions. Steamers from Granton and Aberdeen to Thurso, the Orkneys, and the Shetlands call at Wick going and returning. It is, however, chiefly to its fisheries that the town owes its prosperity. For many years it was the chief seat of the herring-fishing on the east coast of Scotland; but its insufficient harbour accommodation has greatly hampered its progress, and both Peterhead and Fraserburgh more than rival it as fishing ports. The number of boats belonging to the port in 1885 was 807; the value of the herrings cured was £117,754 and of cod, ling, and skate, £61,928. Shipbuilding, formerly prosecuted, has now been discontinued; but boat-building and net-making are extensively carried on. There are also cooperages, flour-mills, steam saw-mills, a rope and a woollen manufactory, and a distillery. Wick forms one of a group of parliamentary burghs called the Wick burghs. The population of the parliamentary burgh, which includes the royal burgh of Wick, Pultneytown, and Louisburgh, was 8145 in 1871 and 8053 in 1881. In the last year the population of the royal burgh was only 1420. In 1883 the royal burgh was extended by the inclusion of Louisburgh. The population of this extended area in 1881 was 2954.

Wick (Vik or “bay”) is mentioned as early as 1140. It was constituted a royal burgh by James VI. in 1589, its superior being [9:24:557] then George, earl of Caithness. By a parliamentary boιιnty in 1768 some impetus was given to the herring-fishery, but its real importance dates from the construction of a harbour in 1808. It has sent one member to parliament since 1832.
