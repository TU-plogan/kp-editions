WHITING, a marine fish (Gadus merlangus), abundant on the shores of the German Ocean and all round the coasts of the British Islands. It is distinguished from the other species of the genus Gadus or Cod-fish by having from thirty-three to thirty-five rays in the first anal fin, and by lacking the barbel on the chin (which is so well developed in the common cod-fish, whiting-pout, &c.) entirely, or possessing only a minute rudiment of it. The snout is long, and the upper jaw longer than the lower. A black spot at the root of the pectoral fin is also very characteristic of this species, and but rarely absent. The whiting is one of the most valuable food fishes of northern Europe, and is caught throughout the year by hook and line and by the trawl. It is in better condition at the beginning of winter than after the spawning season, which falls in the months of February and March. Its usual size is from 1 to 1J pound, but it may attain to twice that weight. In the south of Europe it is replaced by an allied species, Gadus euxini, which, however, seems to be limited to the cold waters of the Adriatic and Black Seas.
