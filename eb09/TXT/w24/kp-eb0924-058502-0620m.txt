WILLIAM of Newburgh, born about 1136, was a canon of Newburgh in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and author of a valuable chronicle of English affairs from the Norman Conquest to 1197. He calls himself Gulielmus Parvus, and is frequently referred to as William Petyt or Little. His work (Gulielmi Neubrigensis Rerum A nglicarum Libri V.) was edited by Silvius at Antwerp in 1567 and by Hearne at Oxford in 1719 (3 vols. 8vo); the latest edition is that by H. C. Hamilton for the English Historical Society (Historia Rerum A nglicarum Willelmi Parvi, S. T.D., Ordinis Sancti Augustini Canonici Regularis in Coenobio B. Mariae de Novoburgo in Agro Eboracensi, 2 vols., 1856).
