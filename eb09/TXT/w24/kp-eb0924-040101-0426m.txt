WATERFORD, a city, county of a city, municipal and parliamentary borough, and the chief town of the above county, is finely situated on the south bank of the Suir 4 miles above its junction with the Barrow, at the head of the tidal estuary called Waterford Harbour, and on several railway lines, which afford it convenient communication with all parts of Ireland. It is 32 miles west of Wexford, 76 north-east of Cork, and 97 south-south-west of Dublin. The Suir is crossed by a wooden bridge of thirty-nine arches, and 832 feet long, connecting Waterford with the suburb of Ferrybank. The town is built chiefly along the banks of the river, occupying for the most part low and level ground except at its western extremity. The modern Protestant cathedral of the Holy Trinity, generally called Christ Church, a plain structure with a lofty spire, occupies the site of the church built by the Danes in 1096. Near it are the episcopal palace and deanery. There is a handsome Catholic cathedral, erected at a cost of <£20,000; and the training seminary for priests called St John’s College deserves notice. The principal secular buildings are the town-hall, the county and city courts and prisons, the new custom-house, erected in 1876, at a cost of £9000, the barracks, and the union workhouse. At the extremity of the quay is a large circular tower, called Reginald’s Tower, forming at one time a portion of the city walls, and occupying the site of the tower built by Reginald the Dane in 1003. Near the summit one of the balls shot from the cannon of Cromwell while besieging the city is still embedded in the wall. There are a number of hospitals and similar benevolent institutions, including the leper house founded in the reign of King John, now possessing an income of £1000 a year, and made use of practically as an infirmary. The town possesses breweries, salt-houses, foundries, and flour-mills; and there is a large export trade in cattle, sheep, and pigs, and in agricultural produce. The population of the city (area 10,059 acres) in 1871 was 29,979, and in 1881 it was 29,181.

Waterford Harbour is a winding and well-sheltered bay, formed by the estuary of the river Suir, and afterwards by the joint estuary of the Nore and Barrow. Its length to the sea is about 15 miles. Its entrance is about 2½ miles wide, and is well lighted by a fixed bright light on the ancient donjon of Hook Tower (139 feet in height), by a red light on Dunmore pier, and by two leading lights at Duncannon. The quay, at which vessels of 2000 tons burden can discharge, was enlarged in 1705 by the removal of the city walls, and is about 1¼ miles in length. At Ferrybank, on the Kilkenny side of the river, there is a shipbuilding yard with patent slip and graving dock. By the Suir there is navigation for barges to Clonmel, by the Barrow for sailing vessels to New Ross and thence for barges to Athy, and by the Nore for barges to Inistiogue. The total number of vessels connected with the port in 1885 was 33, of 5246 tons. The number of British and foreign vessels that entered the port in the same year was 1784 of 530,092 tons, while 1255 of 412,326 tons cleared.

Anciently Waterford was called Cuan-na-groith, the haven of the sun. By early writers it was named Menapia. It is supposed to have existed in very early times, but first acquired importance under the Danes, of whom it remained one of the principal strongholds until its capture by Strongbow in 1171. On 18th October 1172 Henry II. landed near Waterford, and he here received the hostages of the people of Munster. It became a cathedral city in 1096. Prince John, afterwards king of England, who had been declared lord of Ireland in 1177, landed at Waterford in 1185. After ascending the English throne he in 1204 granted it a fair, and in 1206 a charter of incorporation. He landed at Waterford in 1210, in order to establish within his nominal territories in Ireland a more distinct form of government. The city received a new [9:24:402] charter from Henry III. in 1232. Richard II. landed at Waterford in October 1394 and again in 1399. In 1447 it was granted by Henry VI. to John Talbot, earl of Shrewsbury, who was created earl of Waterford. In 1497 it successfully resisted an attempt of Perkin Warbeck to capture it, in recognition of which it received various privileges from Henry VII., who gave it the title of urbs intacta. In 1603, after the accession of James I. to the English crown, the city, along with Cork, took a prominent part in opposition to the Government and to the Protestant religion, but on the approach of Mountjoy it formally submitted. From this time, however, the magistrates whom it elected refused to take the oath of supremacy, and, as by its charter it possessed the right to refuse admission to the king’s judges, and therefore to dispense with the right of holding assizes, a rule was obtained in the Irish chancery for the seizure of its charter, which was carried iuto effect in 1618. In 1619 an attempt was made to induce Bristol merchants to settle in the city and undertake its government, but no one would respond to the invitation, and in 1626 the charter was restored. The city was unsuccessfully attacked by Cromwell in 1649, but surrendered to Ireton 10th August 1650. After the battle of the Boyne James II. embarked at it for France (July 1690). Shortly afterwards it surrendered to William, who sailed from it to England. It sent two members to parliament from 1374 to 1885, when the number was reduced to one.
