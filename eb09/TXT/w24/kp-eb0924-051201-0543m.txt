WESTMACOTT, Sir Richard (1775-1856), one of the principal English sculptors of the classical revival, was born in London in 1775, and while yet a boy learned the rudiments of the plastic art in the studio of his father, who was then a sculptor of some reputation. In 1793, at the age of eighteen, he went to Rome and became a pupil of the Venetian Canova, who was then at the height of his fame. Under the prevailing influences of Italy, at that time Westmacott devoted all his energies to the study of classical sculpture, and throughout his life his real sympathies were with pagan rather than Christian art. Within a year of his arrival in Rome he won the first prize for sculpture offered by the Florentine academy of arts, and in the following year (1795) he gained the papal gold medal awarded by the Roman Academy of St Luke. On his return to London Westmacott began to exhibit his works yearly at the Royal Academy, and soon became the most popular of English sculptors. In 1805 he was elected an associate, and in 1811 a full member of the Royal Academy; in 1827 he was appointed to succeed Flaxman as Royal Academy professor of sculpture, and in 1837 he was knighted. A very large number of important public monuments were executed by him, including many portrait statues; but, like most sculptors of the pseudoclassic revival, he was not successful with this class of draped figure. Little can be said in praise of such works as the statue on the duke of York’s column, the portrait of Fox in Bloomsbury Square, or that of the duke of Bedford in Russell Square. Much admiration was expressed at the time for Westmacott’s monuments to Collingwood and Sir Ralph Abercromby in St Paul’s Cathedral, and that of Mrs Warren in Westminster Abbey; but subjects like these were far less congenial to him than sculpture of a more classical type, such as the pedimental figures over the portico of the British Museum, and his colossal nude statue of Achilles in bronze, set up in Hyde Park in honour of the duke of Wellington; this last statue, though possessing little originality of design, is not without grandeur, and shows a skilful treatment of the nude. Originality was not Westmacott’s strong point, but he was highly trained, and, in spite of his artistically degraded time, possessed a strong natural good taste, which preserved him from reproducing the meretricious feebleness of his master Canova. Westmacott wrote the article Sculpture for the 8th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. He died September 1, 1856, after about fifteen years of retirement from active work.
