WISBECH, or Wisbeach, a municipal borough, markettown, and seaport of Cambridge, England, in the Isle of Ely, is situated on the river Nene, on the Wisbech Canal, by which there is connexion by the Ouse with Hertford, and on branches of the Great Eastern and Midland Railways, 40 miles north of Cambridge, 21 east-north-east of Peterborough, and about 90 from London. It possesses a spacious market-place, a handsome crescent, and several good streets. There is a public park, 18 acres in extent. The greater part of the town is situated on the south side the river, which is crossed by an iron bridge. The church of St Peter and St Paul is very singularly constructed, having two parallel naves, two aisles, and two chancels, with a large square tower at the west end, originally dating from the 12th century, but almost entirely reconstructed about the close of the 15th century. The church contains some semicircular Saxon arches as well as some traces of Early Norman. Among the other public buildings are the corn exchange (re-erected 1811), the public hall, the custom-house, the new cattle market, the working men’s club and institute, and the museum and literary institute, with a library of 12,000 volumes and a fine collection of Roman remains and other antiquities. Besides the Cambridgeshire Hospital (1873) and the twelve corporation almshouses there are a large number of other charities. A grammar-school was established in the middle of the 16th century, and provision was made in the charter of Edward VI. for its continuance. A Gothic monument was erected here to Thomas Clarkson, the anti-slavery orator, in 1881. Vessels of 500 tons burden can enter the port, and extensive wharfage has been erected at a cost of £60,000. The number of vessels that entered the port in 1886 was 294, of 50,721 tons, and the number that cleared 286, of 50,812 tons. The chief imports are corn, potatoes, wool, timber, and iron, and the exports agricultural produce and salt. In the neighbourhood immense quantities of fruit are grown, including apples, pears, plums, gooseberries, and strawberries. Potatoes, asparagus, and other vegetables are also largely grown for the London market. The town possesses agricultural implement works, coach-building works, breweries, ropeworks, planing and sawing mills, and corn and oil-cake mills, many of them driven by water, and others by steam. The town is divided into two wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aidermen, and eighteen councillors. It has a separate commission of the peace. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority. Water is obtained from chalk springs near Norfolk. The population of the municipal borough in 1871 was 9362 and in 1881 it was 9249.

Wisbech was most probably a fort of the Romans, who it is supposed constructed the river banks in the neighbourhood. It takes its name from the river Ouse (Wyse). It is first noticed in 664, in a charter of Wulfhere, son of Penda. In the early part of the [9:24:616] 11th century it was given by Oswy and Leoflede to the convent of Ely, on the admission of their son Alwyn into that monastery. After the subjugation of the Isle of Ely William erected a strong castle at Wisbech to hold the district in subjection. At Domesday the manor was held by the abbot of Ely, and possessed extensive fisheries, especially of eels. In 1190 Richard I. granted to the tenants of the manor exemption from tolls at all fairs and markets in England, a privilege confirmed by King John, who in 1216 visited the town. In 1236 the town and a great part of the castle was destroyed by an inundation, and the castle lay in ruins till the 15th century, when Morton, bishop of Ely, erected a new building of brick for an episcopal residence. In the reign of Elizabeth it was appropriated to the confinement of state prisoners, among others of Robert Catesby. During the Protectorate it was purchased by Thurloe, afterwards secretary of state, who in 1660 erected an entirely new one from designs of Inigo Jones, when some Roman bricks were discovered. On the Restoration it again came into the possession of the bishops of Ely, who sold it in 1793, and all remains of it have now disappeared. Anciently the town possessed eight guilds in addition to that of the Holy Trinity, to which they were subordinate. This guild received royal sanction from Richard II. in 1393, and held its last meeting in 1557. The town received a charter of incorporation from Edward VI. in 1549, which was renewed by James I. in 1611, and confirmed by Charles II. in 1669, remaining in force till the passing of the Municipal Act.
