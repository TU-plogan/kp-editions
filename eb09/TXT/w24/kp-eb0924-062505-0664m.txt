WEOCEAWEK, or Vlotslavsk, a district town of the government of Warsaw, on the left bank of the Vistula, which is crossed by an iron bridge, 118 miles by rail to the N.W. of Warsaw. It was founded about 1139, and became known under the name of Vladislavia, or Old Ladislaus, as a centre for trade of some importance. Later on it fell into decay; but, owing to its position on the great water highway of Poland and on the railway connecting Warsaw with Berlin and Dantzic, its population has rapidly increased of late, and now amounts to 22,600. Its merchants carry on an active trade in grain. It has a fine cathedral, dating from the 14th century.
