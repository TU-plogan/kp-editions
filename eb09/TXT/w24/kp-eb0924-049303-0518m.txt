WELLINGTON, the chief town of Hutt county, New Zealand, and the seat of the colonial Government, is situated in the south-west of North Island, on the shores of Port Nicholson, in 41° 16' 25" S. lat. and 174° 47' 25" E. long., 80 miles east of Nelson, 160 south of New Plymouth, and 1200 south-east of Sydney. The immediate surroundings of Wellington were originally very uninviting, as it is walled in by high ranges unsuitable for tillage, but great enterprise has been shown in the construction of roads to the more fertile regions. Railways are being gradually extended towards both the north and the north-east. Owing to the prevalence of earthquakes the city is built chiefly of wood, but within recent years there has been an increasing tendency to make use of concrete and brick. Among the principal public buildings are the Government house, the houses of legislature, the Government buildings, the new postal and telegraph office, Wellington college, St Patrick’s Catholic college, the oddfellows’ hall, the freemasons’ hall, the hospital, and the lunatic asylum. The city also possesses a colonial museum, an athenaeum and mechanics’ institute, a lyceum, and three theatres. The botanical gardens have an area of 100 acres. There is also a public park called the Town Belt. To supplement the water supply from two large reservoirs at Polhill’s Gully, an aqueduct has lately been constructed from the Wainuiomata river, 16 miles distant, at an expense of £130,000.

Wellington was the first settlement of the New Zealand colonists. It owes its commercial prosperity and its selection as the capital to its convenient and central position. It is the seat of both a Protestant and a Catholic see. The harbour, which has lately been extended and improved, is one of the best and safest in New Zealand. There is a lighthouse at the eastern entrance, on Pincarrow Head, opposite which is the pilot station. There are two large wharves, and in Evans Bay there is a patent slip capable of receiving vessels of 2000 tons. As a shipping port Wellington ranks next to Auckland and Lyttelton. It possesses foundries, shipbuilding yards, boot factories, soap and candle works, tanneries, woollen, coffee, flour, and saw mills, breweries, aerated water works, coach factories, brick and tile works, and a very extensive meatpreserving establishment, which exports large supplies to Europe. The area of the municipal borough is 1100 acres, and from 4176 in 1861 the population increased to 13,488 in 1871 and 20,563 in 1881, while in 1886 the city and suburbs had 27,833 inhabitants.
