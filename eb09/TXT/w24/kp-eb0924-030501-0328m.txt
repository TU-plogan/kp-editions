WAFERS, as articles of stationery, consist of thin, brittle, adhesive disks, used for securing papers together, and for forming a basis for impressed official seals. Wafers are made of a thin paste of very fine flour, baked between “wafer irons” over a charcoal fire till the thin stratum of paste becomes dry and brittle, and the flour starch is partly transformed into glutinous adhesive dextrin. The cake is cut into round disks with suitable steel punches. Bright non-poisonous colouring matter is added to the paste for making coloured wafers. Wafers of gelatin are also made.
