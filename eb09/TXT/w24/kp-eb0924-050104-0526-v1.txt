+=====================================================================+


WENZEL, Karl Friedrich (1740-1793), German metallurgist, was born at Dresden in 1740. His father was a bookbinder, and Wenzel began to learn the same trade; but finding it monotonous he quietly left home and went to Holland at the age of fifteen. In Amsterdam he took lessons in surgery and chemistry, and then entered the Dutch navy as a surgeon. After some years a sea life lost its charm for him, and he resigned, returning to his native land in 1766 to complete his chemical studies at Leipsic. Wenzel now devoted his attention to metallurgy and assaying, working for a time with great success in the town of his birth. He received a prize for the best solution of a problem in workingmetals from the Copenhagen Society of Sciences. He also made some very careful chemical experiments, particularly on the mixture of solutions of various salts, and wrote several books on chemical subjects; his claim for remembrance rests on one of these, Vorlesungen über die chemische Verwandtschaft der Körper. It was published in 1777; a second edition appeared in 1782, and a third with additions in 1800. In 1780 Wenzel received the appointment of director of mines at Freiberg from the elector of Saxony, and in 1786 that of chemist in the porcelain works at Meissen. He died at Freiberg on February 26, 1793.

The discovery of the law of reciprocal proportions in chemistry (see Chemistry, vol. v. p. 463) has been claimed for Wenzel as the result of his researches on the affinities of bodies; and, on the ground of his work being prior to that of Richter, and much more accurate than the earlier experiments of Bergmann on the same subject, he has been regarded as Dalton’s precursor in laying the foundation of the atomic theory. It was pointed out by Hess in 1840 that this was a mistake, since Wenzel’s researches led him to no definite conclusions as to invariable and reciprocal proportions in the combination of acids and bases, but rather pointed in the opposite direction. Kopp overlooked this criticism in writing his great Geschichte der Chemie (1844-1847), which has deservedly taken the highest place as an authority on chemical history; and, although in the supplementary work published in 1873 he acknowledges his mistake as to Wenzel and confirms Hess’s statement, the writers of text-books continue in many cases to give currency to the erroneous view.
