WINTER, Peter (1754-1825), dramatic composer, was born at Mannheim in 1754 (or, according to other accounts, in 1758). He received some instruction from the abbé Vogler, but so little that he may be almost considered as self-taught. After playing in the “kapelle” of the elector Karl Theodor, at Munich, he became in 1776 director of the court theatre. When Mozart produced his Idomeneo at Munich in 1781, Winter, annoyed at his success, conceived a violent hatred towards him; yet his own popularity was both brilliant and lasting, and of more than thirty operas written by him between 1778 and 1820 very few were unsuccessful, though, through lack of dramatic power, none have survived him. His most popular work, Das unterbrochene Opferfest, was produced in 1796 at Vienna, where in 1797-98 he composed Die Pyramiden von Babylon and Das Labyrinth, both written for him by Schickaneder in continuation of the story of Mozart’s Zauberflöte. While in Vienna Winter gratified his spite against Mozart by propagating scandalous and utterly baseless reports concerning his private life. He returned to Munich in 1798. Five years later he visited London, where he produced Calypso in 1803, Proserpina in 1804, and Zaira in 1805, with great success. His last opera, Sänger und Schneider, was produced in 1820 at Munich, where he died October 17, 1825. Besides his dramatic works he composed some effective sacred music, including twenty-six masses.
