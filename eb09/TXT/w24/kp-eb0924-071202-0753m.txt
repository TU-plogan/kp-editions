WYNTOUN, Andrew of, a Scottish monk who flourished at the beginning of the 15th century, was the author of the Orygynale Cronylcil of Scotland. The chronicle, which is in verse and has some historical value from the use made in it of the St Andrews registers, is called “original” because it begins with the beginning of the world, the second chapter giving an account of the creation of man. The history of Scotland is brought down to the death of Robert III. in 1406. Of the chronicler himself nothing is known except what he tells us in his prologue, namely, that he was a canon regular of St Andrews, and prior of Serf’s Inch in Lochleven. The chronicle has been twice carefully edited and annotated,—by Macpherson in 1795, and by David Laing in 1872-79.
