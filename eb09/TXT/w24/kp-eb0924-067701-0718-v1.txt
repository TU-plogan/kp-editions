WORKSOP, a market-town of Nottinghamshire, England, is situated on the Chesterfield Canal, and on the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincoln Railway and the Midland Railway, 16 miles east-south-east of Sheffield and 146∣ from London. It is a well-built and pleasant country town, with considerable traces of antiquity. The church of St Mary and St Cuthbert is an old priory church, once divided internally into two buildings, the eastern dedicated to St Mary being for the use of the canons, and the western dedicated to St Cuthbert for the parishioners. When the priory was demolished at the Reformation only the western portion of the church was spared, and for many years it was in a dilapidated condition until it was restored with Perpendicular additions. Behind it are the ruins of the lady chapel, containing some fine Early English work. The priory gatehouse, chiefly in the Decorated style, now forms the entrance to the precincts of the church. It is supposed to have been built early in the 14th century by the third Lord Furnival, when the market was established. Of the priory itself the only remains are a wall at the northwest corner of the church which includes the cloister gateway. There was a Norman keep on the castle hill, but no remains of the building are now left. The magnificent manor-lιouse, built by Gilbert, first earl of Shrewsbury, and occasionally occupied by Mary queen of Scots during her captivity under the sixth earl, was in great part destroyed by fire in 1761, while being restored at great expense by the duke of Norfolk, and when the estate came into the possession of the duke of Newcastle in 1840 the ruined portion of the mansion remaining was removed and a smaller mansion built near it. The ecclesiastical parish of St John’s was formed in 1867. There is a corn exchange, erected in 1854, in the Venetian style, and a mechanics’ institute, erected in 1852. Formerly liquorice was extensively grown, but malting is now the principal industry. A large corn market and a cattle and horse fair are held. The town also possesses brass and iron foundries, agricultural implement works, saw-mills, and chemical works. The population of the urban sanitary district (18,220 acres) was 10,409 in 1871, and 11,625 in 1881.

Worksop occurs in Domesday as Withercope. By William the Conqueror the manor was bestowed on Roger de Busli. It subsequently passed to William de Lovitot, who in 1103 founded a priory for Augustinian canons dedicated to St Mary. From the De Lovitots it passed successively to the Furni vais, the Nevilles, the Talbots, earls of Shrewsbury, and the Howards, earls of Arundel and afterwards dukes of Norfolk. By the duke of Norfolk it was sold in 1840 to the duke of Newcastle, whoso country mansion, Clumber, is in the parish. In December 1460 an engagement took place at Worksop between the forces of the duke of York and those of the duke of Somerset.
