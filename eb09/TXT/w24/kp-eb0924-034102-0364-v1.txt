WALTON, or Walton-on-the-Hill, a township of Lancashire, England, now practically a suburb of Liverpool, 3 miles north-east of the central station. It consists largely of villas and the better class residences, but a considerable portion of the Parish Church district is occupied by labourers and artisans. The parish church, dedicated to St Mary, was originally founded in 1326, but has all been rebuilt within recent times, the nave in 1742, the chancel in 1810, and the embattled western tower in 1831-32. There are also situated within the township the West Derby union workhouse, erected in 1868 at a cost of £10,000; the borough prison, 1855, £180,000 (which, however, is by a special Act of Parliament included within the borough of Liverpool); and the county police station, 1885, £8000. One of the attractions of Walton is Stanley Park, 100 acres in extent, opened in 1870 at a cost of £200,000. In the neighbourhood are also the Liverpool parochial cemetery, the Anfield Park cemetery, and the Kirkdale cemetery. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1907 acres) in 1871 was 6449, and in 1881 it was 18,536.

The parish of Walton originally included Liverpool, which was separated from the mother church in 1699. At Domesday it was held by a Saxon named Winestan, and subsequently it was for some centuries in the possession of a family who took from it their name. The earl of Sefton is now lord of the manor.
