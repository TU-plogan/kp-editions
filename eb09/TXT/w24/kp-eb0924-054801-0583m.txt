WHISTON, William (1667-1752), English divine and mathematician, was born on 9th December 1667 at Norton in Leicestershire, of which village his father was rector. He was educated privately, partly on account of the delicacy of his health and partly that he might act as amanuensis to his father, who had lost his sight. He afterwards entered at Clare College, Cambridge, where he applied himself with extraordinary diligence to mathematical study, and obtained a fellowship in 1693. He next became chaplain to Moore, the learned bishop of Norwich, from whom he received the living of Lowestoft in 1698. He had already given several proofs of his noble but over-scrupulous conscientiousness, and at the same time of the propensity to paradox and the pragmatical and wayward temper which almost destroyed the usefulness of the fine example of disinterestedness which he gave to a lax and lukewarm age. His Theory of the Earth (1696), although destitute of sound scientific foundation, obtained the praise of both Newton and Locke, the latter of whom justly classed the author among those who, if not adding much to our knowledge, “at least bring some new things to our thoughts.” In 1701 he resigned his living, where his conduct had been most exemplary, to become deputy at Cambridge to Sir Isaac Newton, whom he shortly afterwards succeeded as Lucasian professor of mathematics. For several years Whiston continued to write and preach both on mathematical and theological subjects with considerable success; but his study of the Apostolical Constitutions had convinced him that Arianism was the creed of the primitive church; and with him to form an opinion and to publish it were things almost simultaneous. His heterodoxy soon became notorious, and in 1710 he was deprived of his professorship and expelled the university. The rest of his life was spent in incessant controversy,— theological, mathematical, chronological, and miscellaneous. He vindicated his estimate of the Apostolical Constitutions and the Arian views he had derived from them in his Primitive Christianity, published in 1711. In 1713 he produced a reformed liturgy, and in 1730 one of the most valuable of his books, the Life of Samuel Clarke. While heretical on so many points, he was a firm believer in supernatural Christianity, and frequently took the field in defence of prophecy and miracle, including anointing the sick and touching for the king’s evil. His dislike to rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents of Hoadly’s Plain Account of the Lords Supper. He proved to his own satisfaction that Canticles was apocryphal and that Baruch was not. He was ever pressing his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline, derived from the Apostolical Constitutions, on the rulers of the church, and was lost in sincere astonishment that they could not see the matter in the same light as himself. He assailed the memory of Athanasius with a virulence at least equal to that with which orthodox divines had treated Arius. He attacked Sir Isaac Newton’s chronological system with success; but he himself lost not only time but money in an endeavour to discover the longitude. Of all his singular opinions the best known is his advocacy of clerical monogamy, immortalized in the Vicar of Wakefield. Of all his labours the most useful is his translation of Josephus, with valuable notes and dissertations, which continues to be reprinted to this day. This appeared in 1736. His last “famous discovery, or rather revival of Dr Giles Fletcher’s,” which he mentions in his autobiography with infinite complacency, was the identification of the Tartars with the lost tribes of Israel. About the same time (1747) he finally left the communion of the Church of England for the Baptist, leaving the church literally as well as figuratively by quitting it as the clergyman began to read the Athanasian creed. He died in London, at the house of his son-in-law, on 22d August 1752, leaving an autobiography, which deserves more attention than it has received, both for its characteristic individuality and as a storehouse of curious anecdotes and illustrations of the religious and moral tendencies of the age. It does not, however, contain any account of the proceedings taken against him at Cambridge, these having been published separately at the time.

Whiston is a striking example of a not unfrequent phenomenon, the association of an entirely paradoxical bent of mind with proficiency in the exact sciences. He is still more interesting as exemplifying a less ordinary observation, the possibility of arriving at rationalistic conclusions in theology without the slightest tincture of the rationalistic temper. His conclusions were in many respects those of the latitudinarian divines of his day; but anything more unlike the processes by which they attained these, or the spirit in which they supported them, would be difficult to imagine. He was not only paradoxical to the verge of craziness, but intolerant to the verge of bigotry. “I had a mind,” he says, “to hear Dr Gill preach. But, being informed that he ]ιad written a folio book on the Canticles, I declined to go to hear him.” This moral and intellectual unreason effectually destroyed the weight otherwise due to his erudition and acuteness, and left nothing recommendable for imitation in his conduct as a whole, except his passion for truth and his heroic disinterestedness,—virtues in which few have rivalled him, though some may have exhibited them less ostentatiously. When not engaged in controversy he was not devoid of good sense. He often saw men and things very clearly, and some of his bon-mots are admirable.
