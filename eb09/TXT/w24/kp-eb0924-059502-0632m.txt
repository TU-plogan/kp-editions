WIMBORNE MINSTER, a market town of Dorset, England, is situated on a gentle slope above the river Allen, near its confluence with the Stour, and on the Great Western Railway, 6 miles north of Poole ajιd 114 westsouth-west of London. The feature of the town is the ancient minster. As it now stands, it is a fine cruciform structure of various styles from Early Norman to Perpendicular, and consists of a central lantern tower, nave and choir with aisles, transepts without aisles, western or bell tower, north and south porches, crypt, and vestry or sacristy, with the library over it. Its maximum length is 182 feet, and its maximum breadth 102. The interior was restored in 1856-57. It contains a large number of interesting monuments, including a brass with the date 873 (supposed to mark the resting-place of Ethelred, third son of Ethelwulf), an orrery of the 14 th century, and an octagonal Norman font of Purbeck marble. A new church, dedicated to St John the Evangelist, was built and partly endowed in 1876. The free grammar-school, established in 1497, was refounded by Elizabeth, a portion of the revenues of the monastery being devoted to this purpose. New school buildings in the Elizabethan style were erected in 1851. There are two hospitals, St Margaret’s and Courtenay’s. Near Wimborne is Canford Hall, the seat of Lord Wimborne, a mansion in the Tudor style, built by [9:24:596] Blore in 1826, and improved from designs of Sir Charles Barry. The town depends chiefly on agriculture; but the manufacture of hose is carried on to a small extent, and there are also coachbuilding works. The population of the parish of Wimborne Minster (area 11,966 acres) was 5019 in 1871 and 5390 in 1881.

Wimborne (Saxon Vinburnan) is supposed to have been the Viηdogladia or Ventaglαdiα of the Romans. A nunnery was founded here in 712 by St Cuthberga, sister of Ina, king of the West Saxons. It was destroyed by the Danes about 900, and subsequently became a house of secular canons, when the church became collegiate. The establishment existed till 1547. Wimborne is supposed to have been the scene of a battle between the earl of Devon and the Danes in 851, in which the latter were defeated. It was taken possession of by Ethelwold in 901. The duke of Monmouth was apprehended neaτ Wimborne after his escape from Sedgemoor. The town claims to have been the birthplace of Matthew Prior, the poet.
