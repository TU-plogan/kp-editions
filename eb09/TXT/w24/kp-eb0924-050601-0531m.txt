WESTALL, Richard (1765-1836), subject painter, was born in Hertford in 1765, of a Norwich family. In 1779 he went to London, and was apprenticed to an engraver on silver, and in 1785 he began to study in the schools of the Royal Academy. He painted Esau Seeking Jacobâ€™s Blessing, Mary Queen of Scots Going to Execution, and other historical subjects in water-colour, and some good portraits in the same medium, but he is mainly known as a book-illustrator. He produced five subjects for the Shakespeare Gallery, illustrated an edition of Milton, executed a very popular series of illustrations to the Bible and the prayer-book, and designed plates for numerous other works. In 1808 he published a poem, A Day in Spring, illustrated by his own pencil. His designs are rather tame, mannered, and effeminate. He became an associate of the Royal Academy in 1792, and a full member in 1794; and during his later years he was a pensioner of the Academy. His last employment was to give art instruction to the Princess Victoria. He died on December 4, 1836. His brother, William Westall, A.R.A. (1781-1850), landscape painter, is mainly known by his illustrations to works of travel.
