WINTHROP, John (1606-1676), son of the preceding, was born at Groton, England, February 12, 1606. He graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, studied law at the Inner Temple, London, and then travelled on the Continent, seeing some military and diplomatic service. In 1631 he followed his father to Massachusetts, being made a magistrate in 1633. Returning to England, he obtained a commission as governor of Connecticut under the Say and Sele patent, and sent out the party which put up the fort at Saybrook, at the mouth of the Connecticut river. In 1645 he obtained a title to lands in south-eastern Connecticut, and founded there the present city of New London. Connecticut made him a magistrate in 1651, and elected him governor annually from 1657 until his death. He was the agent who obtained for the colony the charter of 1662. He died at Boston, April 5, 1676.

All of the father’s fine qualities, and more, came out in the son. The father has had a few unfavourable critics; the son has always been looked upon as the flower of American Puritanism. Even the son, however, was only the representative, in obtaining the charter, of a knot of able and determined men, who had clearer notions of the commonwealth life at which they were aiming; and the governor does not seem to have approved all of their somewhat vigorous proceedings in putting it into effect. Physical science had strong attractions for Winthrop. He was one of the first members of the Royal Society, and was constantly interested in mines and mining in New England. The authorities for his life are those given in the preceding sketch. ·
