WIDDIN, or Widin, a fortified town of Bulgaria, within 20 miles of the Servian frontier and about 130 miles south-east of Belgrade, in 44° N. lat. and 22° 50' E. long. It occupies a strong position on the right bank of the Danube over against the Roumanian town of Kalafat, with which it is connected by a bridge of boats over a mile long. Owing to its low situation, the soil is marshy and the city is liable to inundation (six floods having occurred since 1839). Its population in 1888 amounted to 13,435, including 6929 Bulgarians, 3387 Turks, and 1304 Jews. The citadel, always a formidable stronghold, has recently been strengthened and enlarged with a double line of ramparts reaching to the water’s edge, while on the land side the approaches are naturally protected by the extensive marshy tracts formed here by a sharp bend of the Danube from the east to the south. The old town within these lines was formerly inhabited exclusively by Mohammedans, and still presents an Oriental aspect, with its mosques, minarets, and over 1700 stalls lining the bazaar or main thoroughfare of Plevna Ulica. There are a few local industries, such as the making of gold and silver filigree work, saddlery, beer, flour, and cutlery, besides a brisk riverine trade, mainly in the hands of the Jews and Bulgarians. The fisheries in the Danube are of some importance (£20,000 annually).

Widdin stands on the site of the Roman town of Bononia in Maesia Superior, not to be confounded with the Pannonian Bononia, which stood higher up the Danube to the north of Sirmium. Its name figures conspicuously in the military annals of mediaeval and recent times; and it is specially memorable for the overthrow of the Turks by the imperial forces in 1689 and for the crushing defeat of the hospodar Michael Sustos by Pasvan Oglu in 1801. It was again the scene of stirring events during the Russo-Turkish wars of 1854-55 and 1877-78, and successfully resisted the assaults of the Servians in the Servo-Bulgarian War of 1886-87.
