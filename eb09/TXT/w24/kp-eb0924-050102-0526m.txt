WENLOCK, or Much Wenlock, a market-town and municipal borough of Shropshire, England, is situated on a branch of the Great Western Railway, 163Â½ miles northwest of London, 11 south of Wellington, and 12 south-east of Shrewsbury. There are some beautiful remains of the old priory church, including the southern half of the west front, three bays of the south aisle, and three sides of the south transept. The priory was originally founded as a nunnery by St Milburg, granddaughter of Penda, about 680, and after being destroyed by the Danes was refounded by Leofric in 1017. Afterwards it was remodelled by Roger de Montgomery as a house for Cluniac monks, and rose to great magnificence. The church of Holy Trinity is Norman and Early English, with portions of Decorated and Perpendicular. The other principal public buildings are the guild-hall, a quaint old timbered structure, the market-hall adjoining (erected in 1879 to harmonize with the old building), the corn exchange (1852), and the museum, occupying the site of the hospital of St John. The town is chiefly dependent on its agricultural trade. There are limestone quarries in the neigbourhood. The population of the municipal borough (the area of which is about 33,000 acres and embraces 17 parishes) in 1871 was 19,401 and in 1881 it was 18,442. In addition to the municipal authority the town itself is under the government of a local board. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 9737 acres) in 1871 was 2531 and in 1881 it was 2321.

Wenlock is said to date from the pre-Roman period, but owed its rise to importance to the religious foundation of St Milburg. It received the grant of a market from Henry III. in 1224. It was incorporated by Edward IV. in 1448, when it also received the privilege of returning members to parliament, but in 1885 it ceased to have separate representation.
