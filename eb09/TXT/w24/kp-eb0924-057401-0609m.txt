WILLENHALL, a township of Staffordshire, England, in the parish of Wolverhampton, is situated on a branch of the Birmingham Canal and on the Midland and the London and North Western Railways, 3 miles east of Wolverhampton, 12 north-west of Birmingham, and 124 north-west of London. The township includes seven hamlets. The church of St Giles, originally erected in 1350, was rebuilt in 1867 in the Decorated style. There are three other churches in connexion with the Established Church, all of modern origin, and a Roman Catholic church. Willenhall possesses a literary institute, a free library, and a higher grade board school, erected in 1883. The waterworks became in 1868 the property of the Wolverhampton corporation. Willenhall is situated in the neighbourhood of extensive coal and iron mines, and possesses brass and iron foundries, and manufactories of various kinds of ironware, including door locks and padlocks, ironmongery for doors and gates, ferules, files, gridirons, steel traps, screws, and currycombs. There are also varnishing works and maltings. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1368 acres) was 15,902 in 1871 and 16,067 in 1881.

The village began to be of importance in the reign of Elizabeth, when the coal and iron were first wrought.
