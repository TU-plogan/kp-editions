WOLFE, Charles (1791-1823), author of The Burial of Sir John Moore, born in Dublin in 1791, was an Irish clergyman, curate of Ballyclog, in Tyrone, and afterwards of Donoughmore. The poem seems to have been written when Wolfe was still a student in Trinity College, Dublin, and it originally appeared in an Irish newspaper (the Newry Telegraph) in 1817. The initials C. W. were affixed to it at first, but as it was quoted from newspaper to newspaper these were dropped, and, eventually finding its way into the Edinburgh Annual Register, it was claimed for and by as many people as Punch’s famous advice to those about to marry. Wolfe’s Trinity College friends came to the rescue, and one of them (Archdeacon Russell) wrote a memoir which, in spite of its being one of the dullest memoirs ever written, went through at least eight editions—a curious testimony to the popularity of the poem. Wolfe died of consumption at Cork in 1823, at the early age of thirty-two.
