BOTTLE. The first bottles were probably made of the skins of animals. In the Iliad (iii. 247) the attendants are represented as bearing wine for use in a bottle made of goat’s skin, άσκω ⅛ αlγ∈tω. The ancient Egyptians used skins for this purpose, and from the language employed by Herodotus (ii. 121), it appears that a bottle was formed by sewing up the skin and leaving the projection of the leg and foot to serve as a vent, which was hence termed τroδeωμ. The aperture was closed with a plug or a string.

Skin bottles of various forms occur on Egyptian monuments. The Greeks and Romans also were accustomed to use bottles made of skins; and in the southern parts of Europe they are still used for the transport of wine. The accompanying illustration is from specimens at Pompeii and Herculaneum. The first explicit reference to bottles of skin iu Scripture occurs in Joshua (ix. 4), where it is said that the Gibeonites took “old sacks upon their asses, and wine-bottles old and rent and bound up." Skins are still most extensively used throughout Western Asia for the conveyance and storage of water. It is an error to represent the bottles of these ancient Hebrews as being made exclusively of skins. In Jer. xix. 1, the prophet speaks of “a potter’s earthen vessel.” The Egyptians possessed vases, bottles, <fcc., of hard stone, alabaster, glass, ivory, bone, porcelain, bronze, silver, and gold, and also, for the use of the people generally, of glazed pottery or common earthenware. As early as Thothmes III., assumed to be the Pharaoh of the Exodus (1490, B.c.), vases existed of a shape so elegant, and of workmanship so superior, as to show that the art was not, even then, iu its infancy. Iu the annexed cut various specimens of these are represented.

The British Museum contains a fine collection of these articles. The process of making glass bottles is described under the heading Glass.
