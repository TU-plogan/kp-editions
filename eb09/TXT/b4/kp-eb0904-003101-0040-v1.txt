BONDU, a kingdom of Western Africa lying to the W. of Bambouk, from which it is separated by the River Falerne, between 14° and 15° N. lat., and 12° and 13° W. long. The country is an elevated plateau, with hills in the southern and central parts. These are generally unproduc tive, and covered with stunted wood; but the lower country is fertile, and finely clothed with the baobab, the tamarind, and various valuable fruit-trees. It is traversed by beds of torrents, which flow rapidly during the rains, but are empty in the dry season. Cultivation, though it extends over only a comparatively small proportion of the whole surface, is carried on with a measure of activity. The products consist of grain (four species), rice, cotton, indigo, water-melons, cucumbers, tobacco, and fruits. The workmen in the different parts display considerable dexterity, though they employ very rude and defective tools. The people consist chiefly of Foulahs, though the country is much frequented by Mandingoes and Sera woollies for purposes of trade. The exports consist of provisions and cotton cloth manufactured in the country, and slaves and salt are imported. The caravans, bringing the former from the interior to the coast, pass usually through Bondu. The religion and laws of this country are Mahometan, though the precepts of that faith are not very rigorously observed. There are schools, however, in every town, where the Koran and the reading and writing of Arabic are taught; but the scholar is treated as the menial servant of the teacher. The king is nearly absolute, and commands a considerable body of troops, who are much employed in predatory expeditions, chiefly for the purpose of collecting slaves. His revenues are derived from a tenth part of the produce of the land, and of the salt imported, as also from duties on goods passing through his territories, with numerous presents expected or extorted. Park, who was the first European traveller to visit the country, experienced to his cost the rapacity of the reigning prince, being obliged to give up even the coat which he wore. The royal residence was then at Fatteconda; but when Major Gray visited Bondu it had been removed to Bulibani, a small town, with about 3000 of a population, surrounded by a strong clay wall. The population of the whole country is estimated at 1,500,000.
