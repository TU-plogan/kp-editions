BURNOUF, Jean Louts (1775-1844), the father of Eugène Burnouf, was born in 1775. During the intervals of leisure left him by his commercial employment he prosecuted his studies in classical literature, and in 1808 was appointed assistant-professor at the Lycée Charlemagne. He soon afterwards obtained the chair of rhetoric at the Lycée Imperial, which he held till 1826, when he was made the inspector of the Academy. In 1817 he had been appointed professor of Latin eloquence at the Collège de France, and from 1811 to 1822 he acted as president of the École Normale. In 1830 Burnouf was named inspectorgeneral of studies, and on his resignation of this post in 1836 was made librarian of the university. He died in 1844. His most important work was the Méthode pour étudier la Langue Grecque, 1814, which marks an epoch in the study of Greek in France. He also published a valuable edition of Sallust and some excellent translations of Tacitus, and of parts of Sallust and Cicero.
