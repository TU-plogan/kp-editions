BROWN, Dr Thomas, one of the most original and subtle of Scottish psychologists, was born on the 9th January 1778, at Kirkmabreck, Kirkcudbright, of which parish his father was the clergyman. In 1780 the family removed to Edinburgh, but he was not placed at any of the schools in that city. At the age of seven he was sent to London, and began his regular education at a school in Camberwell, from which he was soon afterwards removed to Chiswick. At Chiswick he was thoroughly grounded in classics, and began to give promise of great ability, particularly in the department of verse composition, one of his school poems being deemed worthy of insertion in a magazine. He was a boy of a refined, gentle nature, intensely studious, a devourer of literature of all kinds, and much loved by his companions. After attending two other schools at Bromley and Kensington, he returned to Edinburgh, and in 1792 began his course at the university by joining the logic class, then conducted by Professor Finlayson. During the summer of 1793 he made acquaintance with Dugald Stewart’s Philosophy of the Human Mind, and found himself irresistibly attracted towards metaphysical speculation. He joined Stewart’s class, that of moral philosophy, in the following session, and quickly introduced himself to the professor’s notice by reading to him a paper of objections to one of his theories, marked by great acuteness and ability. His attendance on the classes at the university seems to have been somewhat desultory; it does not appear that he ever passed through the regular curriculum of arts studies. But he carried on his reading with great vigour, and while still a student made his first appearance in the arena of philosophical disputation. His attention had been drawn towards Darwin’s Zoonomia, which was then exciting a lively sensation in the literary world. His remarks on this book were published in 1798, and were received with great approval as one of the best and most mature examinations of the theory. His next contribution to literature was an article in the second number of the Edinburgh Review on the philosophy of Kant. It is acute, like all that Brown ever wrote, but it shows neither sufficient knowledge nor adequate appreciation of the philosopher it handled. Meantime he had been devoting himself to the study of medicine, having relinquished that of law, to which for a while he had applied. His graduation thesis, De Somno, which was thought worthy of being published, is a fine piece of psychologico-medical analysis. A few months later appeared two volumes of his poems, which were not received with much favour. Nor did his later poetical efforts attain much popularity, with the partial exception of the Paradise of Coquettes. They all show refined feeling and sweetness of diction, but they are wanting in the elements of true poetry. They are faint echoes of Akenside and Beattie, neither of whom can stand much dilution. Brown’s real strength lay altogether in metaphysical analysis, and a favourable opportunity for calling it forth soon presented itself. Some captious objections had been raised against the appointment of the celebrated Leslie to the professorship of mathematics, on the ground that he had approved of Hume’s doctrine of causality. The Humian theory was believed to lead inevitably to scepticism and infidelity, and these consequences were, of course, charged upon Leslie. Brown undertook the defence not of Leslie but of Hume, and in his examination of Hume’s doctrine showed that in reality the theory was in no way inimical to the interests of true religion or theology. This examination, at first but a pamphlet, swelled out in its third edition (1818) into a bulky treatise, Inquiry into the Relation of Cause and Effect, containing not merely a criticism of Hume, but an elaborate theory of the causal relation. This relation Brown regards as nothing but constancy of antecedence and sequence, while at the same time he admits an intuitive belief in the permanency or universality of the causal connection. The work is a fine specimen of Brown’s faculty of analysis, which it exhibits in its very best aspect.

As early as 1806 Dr Brown had engaged in practice as a physician, having been received into partnership with Dr Gregory; but though very successful in his profession, he was by nature more strongly attracted towards a literary life. He had twice failed in his application for a professorship in the university of Edinburgh, when in the session 1808-9 he was called upon to deliver a few lectures to the class of moral philosophy, in consequence of the temporary illness of Dugald Stewart. In the following year, Stewart’s health still incapacitating him from active exertion, Dr Brown delivered the lectures for the greater part of the session. His success in conducting the class was unequivocal; the enthusiasm of the students was such as one reflects on with a little wonder. They were fascinated not more by the splendid rhetoric of the lecturer than by the novelty and ingenuity of the views presented. In the summer of 1810 it was resolved to appoint Brown as colleague to Dugald Stewart, and in the ensuing session he began his course as professor of moral philosophy. During the few remaining years of his life he published only his poems, but he was busily engaged in preparing an abstract of his lectures to serve as a handbook for the class. His health, never strong, gave way completely under the pressure of his work. A voyage to London, which had been recommended, proved of no avail, and he died on the 2d April 1820, at the early age of forty-two. After his death were published the first part of his proposed text-book, Physiology of the Human Mind, and the Lectures on the Philosophy [9:4:388] of the Human Mind, 4 vols., of which the Physiology is an abstract. The fame achieved by the Lectures when published surpassed even what they had attained when delivered. It is no exaggeration to say that never before or since has a work of metaphysics been so popular. In 1851 the book had reached its 19th edition in England, and in America its success was perhaps greater. Since that time, however, its popularity has declined with almost equal rapidity; judgments on its merits are now as severe as they were formerly favourable, and the name of Brown may be said to be a dead letter in the annals of philosophy. It is interesting to inquire how far this extravagant laudation and neglect are justifiable; and it is of importance to know exactly what were Brown’s contributions to mental science, and how far his system is consistent and true.

Some part of Brown’s popularity is no doubt to be accounted for from the fact that he was the leader of a revolt against the established system of philosophical thought in Scotland. It had come to be looked upon as established that in the common sense philosophy of Reid alone were metaphysical truth and soundness to be found. Brown not only showed that in many points of detail the earlier Scottish psychology was in fault, above all in their crucial doctrine of perception, but changed the whole aspect of the science by treating itfrom a thoroughly new and original standpoint. Still more of his fame was due to the lively impression made by his brilliant rhetorical powers. It was a novelty to find the most subtle analysis expounded in the most richly poetical language. Philosophical diction had been dry enough in Reid, and though Dugald Stewart was a master of literary exposition, his eloquence was of a chaste and elegant kind. Brown’s, on the other hand, is florid and ornamental to excess, and one soon wearies of the copious quotations from poets like Akenside, Beattie, or Young. Yet the style had, and still has, a certain fascination. But in addition to these extraneous causes, one cannot help acknowledging as the main reason for Brown’s quick accession to fame, his undeniable acuteness and originality. His mind was extraordinarily quick and active; there is not one of his lectures which does not contain either some addition to the older doctrine, or some new and striking application of it. What a mind of such fertility and subtility might have achieved had the thinker been spared a little longer, it would be hard to say. But it must not be forgotten in estimating his merits, that we possess only part of his system, and that he had not brought his psychology to bear upon the deeper problems of metaphysics.

Of positive contributions made by him to mental science, the following are perhaps the most important:—(1.) General conception of the object and method of psychology. According to him mental phenomena are to be treated by the recognized methods of physical science. Complex mental facts are to be resolved into their simple elements; and sequences of such facts are to be analyzed so as to bring out the general laws of their connection. Analysis is thus the one instrument to be employed. (2.) View of mental processes and rejection of the ordinary doctrine of faculties. Just as physical science has to analyze and trace the connections of the various phenomena or modes of appearance of matter, without ever reaching the essence which lies behind them, so psychology treats all mental facts as states or modes or modifications of the mind. Perceptions, abstractions, emotions, or desires are simply the mind in the several states of perceiving, abstracting, feeling, or desiring. The so-called faculties are nothing but the various modes in which mental activity manifests itself. Consciousness is not to be distinguished from the several mental states. Mental modifications may be classified according to what gives rise to them; they spring up either after some internal cause, or after some other mental mode. In the first case they may be called external states, in the second, internal. The internal may be again divided into intellectual and emotional. (3. ) Analysis of touch into touch proper and the muscular sense. This is perhaps the most valuable of Brown’s contributions. There are no doubt anticipations of the division, particularly in De Tracy, whom Brown had studied, but his originality is, we think, beyond question. The analysis has since been carried out much more perfectly than by Brown. (4.) Theory of extension. Brown was one of the first to attempt the resolution of our knowledge of extension into a series of muscular feelings, successive in time. His analysis is exceedingly acute, though in many points it must now be looked upon as erroneous. (5.) Doctrine of perception. According to him, all that we know of the external world consists of the feelings of resistance, outness, and extension, which are combined into one complex state; but our intuitive belief in the causal principle compels us to postulate a real existence as Tying behind and giving rise to these feelings. (6.) Prominence given to the doctrine of suggestion or association. All internal intellectual states may be reduced to simple suggestions, i.e., where one state arises in consequence of another, and to relative suggestion, where the relation between two states gives rise to a third state. Brown analyzes with great skill the powers of suggestion or association, and illustrates very fully the primary and secondary states. Undeι∙ the head of relative suggestion, he discusses at great length the perception of resemblance or similarity, and draws out an elaborate theory of generalization, intended to supplement the defective view of the Nominalist and to reduce to its proper sphere the supposed abstract idea of the Conceptualist. The analysis was highly popular in its time, but has little of real novelty in it. (7.) Ethical doctrine. To this Brown added little; indeed, the weakest part of his psychology is that bearing upon the will, which he identifies with desire. With regard to conscience, he postulates the existence of a primitive susceptibility to moral emotion; i.e., a certain ethical feeling is infallibly excited by those actions of agents which are right or wrong.

On the whole, it will be seen from this brief statement of what was new in Brown’s philosophy, that it occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later analytical or associational psychology. . To the latter Brown really belonged, but he had preserved certain doctι⅛es of the older school which were out of harmony with his fundamental view. He still retained a small quantum of intuitive beliefs, and did not appear to see that the very existence of these could not be explained by his theory of mental action. This intermediate or wavering position accounts for the comparative neglect into which his works have now fallen. They did much to excite thinking, and advanced many problems by more than one step, but they did not furnish a coherent system, and the doctrines which were then new have since been worked out with greater consistency and clearness.

For a severe criticism of Brown, see Sir W. Hamilton’s Discussions and Lectures on Metaphysics; and for a high estimate of his merits, see J. S. Mill's Examination of Hamilton. The only German writer who seems to have known anything of Brown is Beneke, who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines. See Die Neue Psychologie, pp. 320-330. (R. AD.)
