BUSHNELL, Horace, D.D. (1802-1876), an American theologian, was born at Litchfield in Connecticut, in April 1802, and died on the 17th of February 187G. He studied at Yale College, where he graduated in 1827, after which he was for eleven months editor of the Journal of Commerce, and then teacher in a school in Norwich (Connecticut). In 1829 he became tutor in Yale College. His first study was law, but in 1831 he resolved to devote himself to theology, and in 1833 he was chosen pastor of the North Congregational Church in Hartford (Connecticut), where he remained twenty-four years. During the remainder of his life he had no settled charge, but he continued to be diligently employed both as a preacher and as an author. He took an active part in the establishment of the university of California, and was asked to become its president. Having determined to value truth more highly than peace or consistency, Bushnell thought, and expressed his conclusions, with such freedom as to bring on himself a charge of false doctrine. In 1849 he published God in Christ, with an introductory Dissertation on Language as related to Thought, in which, it was said, he expressed heretical views as to the Trinity. He was acquitted by seventeen votes to three, but his influence with his church was such that it withdrew from the “Consociation” by which he had been tried, and thenceforward stood alone, a true “congregational” church, whose minister was amenable to no external authority. Bushnell formally replied by writing Christ in Theology, in which he employs the important argument that spiritual facts can only be expressed in approximative and poetical language, and concludes that an adequate dogmatic theology cannot exist. That he did not deny the divinity of Christ he proved in The. Character of Jesus, forbidding his possible classification with Men. He has also published Christian Nurture, (1847); Seιmons for the New Life, (1858); Nature and the Supernatural, (1858); Christ and his Salvation, (1864); Work and Play, (1864); The Vicarious Sacrifice, grounded on Principles of Universal Obligation, (1865); Moral Uses of Dark Things, (1868); Sermon on Living Subjects; Women's Suffrage, the lieform against Nature, (1869); and Forgiveness and Law, (1874).
