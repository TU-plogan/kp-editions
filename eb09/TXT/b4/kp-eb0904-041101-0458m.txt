BUCCARI, a royal free town of the Hungarian crown, situated in the comitat of Fiume, on a small bay of the Adriatic, in 45° 18' 46" N. lat. and 14° 32' 11" E. long. Its harbour is of rather limited dimensions, but the roadstead is excellent, though the approach is not unattended with danger. The staple industry is the weaving of linen; shipbuilding is also carried on, and there is an active coasting trade in fish, wine, wood, and coal. The tunnyfishery is of some importance. In the neighbourhood of the town is the old castle of Buccaricza, and further south the flourishing little port of Porto Ré or Kraljevicza. The population of Buccari in 1869 was 2116.
