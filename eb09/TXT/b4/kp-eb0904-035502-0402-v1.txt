+=====================================================================+


BRITTON, John, a topographical and antiquarian writer, was born at Kingston-St-Michael, near Chippenham, July 7, 1771. His birthplace, an old-world village of the dullest and sleepiest kind, had also the distinction of being the home of the antiquary John Aubrey. His parents were in humble circumstances, and he was left an orphan at an early age. He grew up with no better education than was to be had in the poor schools of his native Wiltshire village and neighbouring places, the last to which he was sent being at Chippenham. At the age of fourteen he became possessed of a small lot of books, and among them were Robinson Crusoe, the Pilgrim's Progress, and The Life of Peter, Czar of Muscovy. At sixteen he went to London, [9:4:356] and through the influence of a relative was apprenticed to a wine merchant. Prevented by failing health from serving his full six years, he found himself adrift in the world, without money, without friends, and without education. In his hand-to-hand fight with poverty he was put to strange shifts, becoming cellarman at a tavern and clerk to a lawyer, reciting and singing at a small theatre, and compiling a collection of common songs. During his apprenticeship he had read much in a loose, aimless manner; and gradually by successive small ventures he found his way into the broad paths of literature. A Salisbury publisher having projected a work on Wiltshire, invited Britton to undertake its preparation. The proposal was accepted; and in conjunction with his friend Edward Wedlake Brayley, Britton set himself to the task. Such was the small beginning of the voluminous work entitled The Beq,uties of England and Wales. The Beauties of Wiltshire appeared in two volumes in 1801, a third volume being added in 1825. The authors proceeded with other counties, and nine volumes of the entire series were their work. In the course of these early labours Britton’s attention was especially drawn to antiquarian subjects; and thenceforth his proper field was before him, and in it he worked honourably. In 1805 appeared the first portion of his Architectural Antiquities of Great Britain, which extended to five volumes quarto, and was nine years in publication. On its completion Britton commenced his great work on the Cathedral Antiquities of England, the section on Salisbury Cathedral being the first published. It was completed in 1835, having been more than twenty years in progress, and forming altogether fourteen folio volumes. It is profusely illustrated by copperplate engravings.

As sole or joint author or editor Britton’s name is attached to a large number of works of a like character. Among these may be mentioned the Historical Account of Redcliffe Church, Bristol (1813); Illustrations of FonthillAbbey (1823); Architectural Antiquities of Normandy, with illustrations by Pugin, published in 1825-1827; Picturesque Antiquities of English Cities (1830); and the splendid History of the Palace and Houses of Parliament at Westminster, the joint work of Britton and Brayley, published in 1834-36. Mr Britton was a frequent contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine and other periodicals; he wrote the article “Shakespeare” for Rees’s Cyclopaedia, and the articles “Stonehenge,” “Avebury,” and “Tumulus” for the Penny Cyclopaedia. In his later years he began to write his Autobiography, but did not carry the personal narrative far. The portion published is rich in literary anecdote of the times. Britton died in London, Januaryl,ιl857, and his remains were inteιτed in Norwood Cemetery. A Descriptive Account of his Literary Works was published by his assistant T. E. Jones. Britton was the originator of a hew class of literary works. “Before his time,” says Mr Digby Wyatt, “popular topography was unknown.” He first combined antiquarian with topographical description. He effected a great improvement in the style and character of the illustrations of ancient monuments; and the general admiration excited by the engravings in his works gave rise to a novel interest in his subject, and became one of the incitements to deeper studies and investigations.
