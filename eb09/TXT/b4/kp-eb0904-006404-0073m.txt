BORROMEAN ISLANDS, a group of four small islands on the western side of Lago Maggiore, in Northern Italy, beautifully surrounded by lake and mountain. Naturally mere barren rocks, they were in 1671 converted by Vitaliano Borromeo into pleasure gardens of great [9:4:65] beauty, the soil being transported from the neighbouring shores of the lake. The two most celebrated are the Isola Bella and the Isola Madre. The former rises 130 feet above the level of the water, in ten successive terraces, the highest of which is paved and surrounded by a balustrade, while all are environed by gigantic marble statues of various figures, and the walls are clothed with the finest fruit-trees and evergreens. There is, besides, towards the western end of the islaud, and close to the lake, a magnificent palace, built on arches, which are formed into grottos, with floors of mosaic and decorations of shell-work and marble. Isola Madre, which is the largest of the group, lies between one and two miles from Isola Bella, and consists of a superstructure of seven terraces, not less beautiful than the other. Here also there is a palace, now dilapidated, with similar decorations. A richly-coloured description of the place is given in his “Titan,” by Jean Paul Richter.
