BROME, Richard, a dramatic writer in the reign of Charles I., and a contemporary of Dekker, Ford, Shirley, and others. He was originally a servant of Ben Jonson; but he soon acquired a high Hterary reputation, and was addressed in some lines by his quondam master on account of his comedy entitled The Northern Lass. Brome’s genius lay entirely in comedy. His plots are original and well managed, and his characters, which for the most part are strongly marked, were drawn from his own experience. He has left fifteen comedies. See Ward’s English Dramatic Literature, 1875, vol. ii., for a good notice of Brome.
