BOURGAS, Burghaz, or Borgas, called in the Middle Ages Pyrgos, a seaport town of Turkey in the province of Rumelia, situated on a bay of the Black Sea, to which it gives its name, about 70 miles N.E. of Adrianople, in 42° 30' N. lat. and 27° 30' E. It is neatly built, and has a large public square surrounded with stalls for the accommodation of 5000*horses. Pottery and pipes are manufactured with great 'taste from clay obtained in the neighbourhood, and there is a considerable trade in grain, woollen stuffs, tallow, butter, cheese, rosewater, and other productions of the surrounding country. Not far distant is Litzin, a favourite summer watering-place. In 1825 the Russians besieged the town. The population is estimated at 5000.
