BRECHIN, a parliamentary burgh of Scotland in the county of Forfar, 7⅜ miles W. of Montrose, and connected by a branch-line with the Caledonian Railway. It is situated on an abrupt declivity on the north bank of the River South Esk, here crossed by a stone bridge of very early date. The principal buildings comprise the parish church (with steeple and spire 128 feet high)—forming part of an ancient and uncompleted cathedral, of Gothic architecture, which has been injured by modern alterations, several other churches, a town-house, the public and Smith’s school, a mechanics’ institute, and an infirmary. The diocesan library hall of the Episcopal church contains an extensive and valuable collection of books, many of them presented by Bishop Abernethy-Drummond, and about 2000 by the late Bishop Forbes, who erected the building. Some ruins remain in the “vennel” of the Maison Dieu, or hospitium, founded by William of Brechin in 1256. The most remarkable edifice, however, is the round tower, situated in the churchyard near the cathedral. This tower is similar to those so common in Ireland, but in Scotland is only rivalled by the tower at Abernethy. Like similar buildings, it contains no stair, and the only access to the top is by means of ladders placed on wooden floors, which rest on circular stone projections within the tower. The height from the ground to the roof is 86f-feet, the inner diameter within a few feet of the bottom is 8 feet, and the thickness of the wall at that part about 4 feet; the circumference[9:4:243] is very near 50 feet; the inner diameter at top is 6 feet 7 inches, the thickness of the wall 2 feet 10 inches, and the circumference 38 feet 8 inches. These proportions give the building a high degree of elegance. The top is roofed with an octagonal spire 18 feet high, which makes the whole height of the building 101 feet 9 inches. Brechin Castle, which was a place of some strength during the Wars of the Independence, now a seat of Lord Dalhousie, lies a little to the south of the town. There is a public park near the town, and two large nurseries. There are three extensive power-loom linen factories (one of them a building of much taste), two bleach-fields, two distilleries, a brewery, and a paper-work; and extensive freestone quarries exist in the neighbourhood. The town is lighted with gas, and an ample supply of water has been introduced at great expense. Weekly markets are held on Tuesdays; and statutory fairs for horses, cattle, and sheep are held at Trinity Muir, about a mile north of the town. Brechin unites with Montrose, Arbroath, Forfar, and Bervie in returning one member to parliament. The population of the parliamentary burgh was in 1871, 7959; and of the royal burgh, 5083.

Brechin is a place of great antiquity, and was chosen by the Culdees as the site of one of their convents. It is said to have been burned by the Danes in 1012. In 1150 it was erected into a bishopric by David I. In 1572 James VI. gave a grant for founding a hospital in the burgh, which still supplies the magistrates with funds for charity. In 1645 the town and castle were harried by the marquis of Montrose. Maitland the topographer and Gillies the historian of Greece were natives of Brechin.
