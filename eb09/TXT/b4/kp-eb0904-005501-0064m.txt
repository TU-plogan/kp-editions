BORN, Ignatius, Bakon von, an eminent mineralogist aud metallurgist, was born of a noble family, at Karlsburg in Transylvania, in 1742 He was educated in a Jesuit college at Vienna, and entered that order, which, however, after sixteen months, he quitted. After studying law at Prague he travelled into Germany, Holland, and France. On his return to Prague he engaged in the Study of mineralogy. Austria produces various metals in considerable abundance, and the administration of the revenue arising to Government from this source is conducted by local boards, under the control of the chamber of mines at Vienna. This administration offers a field of some preferment; and Von Born was received into the department of the mines and mint at Prague in 1770. About this time he met with an accident which nearly proved fatal, in the course of a journey through Transylvania Having entered a mine at Felso-Banya, whilst the air was charged with arsenical vapour, he was stupified for fifteen hours, and long afterwards suffered from a cough and general pain. Some time after this accident he was affected with violent colics, and in the latter part of his life was deprived of the use of both legs. These calamities, however, did not repress the activity of his mind. He had to give up his assessorship of the mining council, but continued to produce works on mineralogy which won him a European reputation. He met with much opposition in attempting to introduce amalgamation in Hungary, in place of smelting and cupellation, for extracting silver from the ores. His opponents endeavoured to prove his process inferior to that already in use; and, after it had been tried successfully, pronounced it to be merely the old Spanish process of amalgamation. The emperor, however, ordered that his method should be employed in mines belonging to Government, and that he should receive a third part of the savings arising from the improvement during the first ten years, and 4 per cent, of this third part for the next twenty years. In 1766 he was appointed by Maria Theresa to arrange the imperial museum at Vienna, where he was made councillor of state, and continued to reside until his death. Von Born attempted satire with no great success. The Staats Perücke, a tale published without his knowledge in 1772, and an attack on Father Hell, the Jesuit, and king’s astronomer at Vienna, are two of his satirical works. Part of a satire, entitled Monachologia, in which the monks are described in the technical language of natural history, is also ascribed to him. Von Born was well acquainted with Latin and the principal modern, languages of Europe, and with many branches of science not immediately connected with metallurgy and mineralogy. He took an active part in the political changes in Hungary. After the death of Joseph, the diet of the states of Hungary rescinded many innovations of that scheming ruler, and conferred the rights of denizen on several persons who had been favourable to the cause of the Hungarians, and, amongst others, on Von Born At the time of his death in 1791, he was employed in writing a work entitled Fasti Leopoldini, probably relating to the prudent conduct of Leopold II., the successor of Joseph, towards the Hungarians.
