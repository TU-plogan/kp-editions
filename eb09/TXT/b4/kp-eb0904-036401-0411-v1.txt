BRÖNDSTED, Peter Oluf, archaeologist, was the son of a Danish clergyman, and was born at Horsens in Jutland on 17th November 1781. He received his academical education at the university of Copenhagen; and in 1802 he visited Paris in company with his friend Koes. After remaining there two years, they went together to Italy. Both were zealously attached to the study of antiquities; and congeniality of tastes and pursuits induced them both, in 1810, to join Baron Stackelberg, Von Haller, and Linckh of Stuttgart, in an expedition to Greece, where they examined with attention the interesting remains of ancient art, and engaged with ardour in excavations among the ruins, which were carried on, especially by Bröndsted and Stackelberg, with very interesting results. The discoveries Bröndsted made were made public in several works, which show learning and sagacity such as have seldom been applied to the elucidation of antiquity with happier results. After three years of active researches in Greece, Bröndsted returned to Copenhagen, where, as a reward for his labours, he was appointed professor of Greek in the university. He now began to arrange and prepare for publication the vast materials he had collected during his travels; but finding that Copenhagen did not afford him the desired facilities, he exchanged his professorship for the office of Danish envoy at the papal court in 1818, and took up his abode at Rome. He also, in 1820 and 1821, went to Sicily and the Ionian Isles to collect additional materials for his great work; and when the artistic illustrations were completed, he obtained leave to visit Paris to superintend the publication. In 1826, he came over to London, chiefly with a view to study the Elgin marbles and other remains of antiquity in the British Museum, and became acquainted with the principal archaeologists of England.

He returned to Copenhagen in 1832, when he immediately received the appointment of director of the royal museum of antiquities, and the professorship of archaeology and philology. His merits were ten years afterwards further rewarded with the honourable office of rector of the university; but an unlucky fall from his horse caused the death of this eminent man on the 26th June 1842. His principal work was the Travels and Archaeological Researches in Greece, published in German and French, 1826-30. His dissertations on points of ancient art are very numerous.
