BROWN, John, author of the Self-Interpreting Bible, was born at Carpow, in Perthshire, in 1722. He was almost entirely self-educated, having acquired a knowledge of Latin, Greek, and Hebrew while employed as a shepherd. He was, for a great part of his life, minister of the Burgher branch of the Secession Church in Haddington, and also discharged the duties of professor of divinity. Though ho had not enjoyed the advantages of a regular education, he mastered the classical tongues, as well as several modern and Oriental languages, and gained a just reputation for learning and piety. He died in 1787. The best of his works, which are very numerous, are his Self Interpreting Bible and Dictionary of the Bible, works that were long very popular in Scotland. He also wrote a valuable Body of Divinity.
