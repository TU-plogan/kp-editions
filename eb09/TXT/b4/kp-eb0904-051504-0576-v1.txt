Towards the end of the last century, the district passed into the hands of Perron, a French common sailor, who had won his way up to the rank of a general in the Marhattá. service. Its annexation formed one of the leading points in the Marquis Wellesley’s policy, and it was ceded to us by the Scindia treaty of 1803. Bulandshahr enjoyed a bad conspicuousness in the mutiny of 1857, when the Gujar peasantry plundered the towns.
