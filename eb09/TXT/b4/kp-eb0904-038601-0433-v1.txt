BROWN, Samuel, chemist, poet, and essayist, was born at Haddington on the 23d February 1817, and died 26th September 1856. He was the son of Dr Samuel Brown, the founder of itinerating libraries, and grandson of the author of the Self-Interpreting Bible. In 1832 he entered the university of Edinburgh, and almost from the first devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to the study of chemistry. The ultimate problems of the science spe [9:4:387] cially attracted his attention, and he came to be persuaded that elements usually regarded as chemically simple and primary were transmutable into each other. Believing that he could demonstrate this in the case of carbon and silicon, he became a candidate for the chair of chemistry in Edinburgh university in 1843; but he withdrew his application on finding his proof inconclusive. In 1849 he delivered in Edinburgh a series of lectures of great value on the history of chemistry from the earliest times to Lavoisier. In 1850 he published the tragedy of Galileo, which had considerable merit. He was also an occasional contributor of articles on general literature as well as on subjects connected with his favourite science to the leading reviews. His time, however, was chiefly spent in his laboratory; and at the date of his death in 1856 he believed that he was within a very little of demonstrating the great fundamental theory in which his own faith had never wavered. Though his work was thus left incomplete, he did enough to entitle him to a place in the foremost rank of those who have cultivated the higher chemistry. An interesting collection of his essays and papers, which display general literary power of a very high order, was published in two volumes in 1858.
