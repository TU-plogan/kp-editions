BRIDPORT, a parliamentary and municipal borough and market-town of England, in the county of Dorset, 18 miles by rail N.W. from Dorchester between two branches of the River Brit, from which it takes its name. The main part of the town is about a mile from the sea, with which it is connected by a single winding street, terminating in a quay surrounded by a fishing village. The principal buildings comprise a townhall, a market-house, a jail, a customhouse, a mechanics’ institute with reading and lecture rooms; there are also a school of art, alms-houses, and several charities. The parish church of St Mary, a cruciform edifice in the Perpendicular style, was restored in 1865. The harbour, which had become choked with sand, was rendered available and secure for vessels of 250 tons by extensive improvements undertaken in 1742 and 1823. The total value of the imports, which consist mainly of timber, coal, and flax, was in 1874 £89,616; and the exports amounted to £18,021. Its principal articles of manufacture have long been sailcloth, cordage, linen, and fishing-nets. Bridport formerly returned two members to parliament, but since 1868 it returns only one. The population was 7670 in 1871. Though a place of considerable antiquity, it has very little historical importance. Its mint is mentioned in Domesday Book. In the reign of Henry VIII. the town and district had a monopoly of the supply of cordage for the Royal Navy.
