BUKOWINA., a duchy and crown-land of the Austrian empire, bounded on the N. and N.W. by Galicia, W. by Hungary and Transylvania, S. by Moldavia, and E. by Moldavia and Russia. It has an area of 4036 English square miles, and the population in 1869 amounted to 511,964, of whom 255,919 were males and 256,045 females. The country, especially in its southern parts, is largely occupied by offshoots of the Carpathian mountains. Its northern border is skirted by the Dniester, and a considerable section is drained by the Pruth, but by far the larger portion belongs to the system of the Danube, and is watered by the head streams of the Sereth, the Moldava, and the Bistritza. The climate is healthy but severe, especially in winter; and the soil, particularly in the north, is of great fertility. A large part of the surface, —according to official statistics in 1870, no less than 1,050,849 acres, or nearly one-half of the whole,—is occupied by woodland; and the very name of the country is derived from the abundance of beech-trees. Wheat, rye, oats, maize, barley, beans, potatoes, flax, and hemp are all more or less cultivated; and about 643,319 acres of arable land are under tillage. Gardens and meadows occupy 301,706 acres, vineyards 11, and pasture 290,531. In 1870 the number of horses in the duchy was 42,649, cattle 224,424, sheep 217,913, goats 18,786, and swine 133,385, while the bee stocks amounted to no fewer than 27,091. The mineral productions comprise copper, iron, lead, silver, coal, salt, sulphur, and alabaster, some of which, however, are only yielded in very moderate quantities. In 1870 the iron ore obtained amounted to 5808 tons, the copper to 945, and the salt 2590. The principal mineral springs are at Dorna-Watra, Jakobeny, and Lopuszna, but none of them as yet are much frequented. The country is divided into the eight districts of Czernowitz, Kimpolung, Kotzmann, Radautz, Sereth, Storozynec, Suczawa, and Wisznitz, the capital Czernowitz forming a separate and ninth division. There are seven towns in all, eight market-villages, and 456 hamlets, the most populous places being Czernowitz with 33,884 of a population, Radautz 9429, Suczawa 7450, Sereth 6486, Kuszusmare 6419, and Kimpolung 5561. Industrial activity is still comparatively slight, the most important establishments being the breweries, of which there were fifteen in 1870, and the distilleries, which numbered forty-nine. The population is of various origin,— about 180,000 being Roumanians, 200,000 Ruthenians, and the rest Germans, Poles, Jews, Hungarians, & c . The German language alone is used in twenty-one of the village schools, and Roumanian in forty-nine, while in many both are in use. In 1869 there were 376,946 adherents of the Greek church, 74,347 Catholics, 11,393 Protestants, and 47,772 Jews, the total population amounting to 511,964, while in 1857 it was only 456,920. The Bukowina diet consists by the law of 1861 of thirty members, including, besides the bishop, ten appointed by the landed proprietors, seven by the towns, and twelve by the rural communes. Five members are sent to the imperial diet. Originally a part of Transylvania, Bukowina, passed in 1482 to Moldavia, and in 1775 to Austria, who united it in 1786 as the Czernowitz circle with Galicia, but in 1849 raised it to its present independence.
