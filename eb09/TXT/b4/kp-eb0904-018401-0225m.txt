BOYLE, Richard, earl of Burlington and Cork, son of the subject of last notice, was born in 1612. He greatly distinguished himself by his loyalty to Charles I., whom during his troubles he supplied with both money and troops; but at last he was obliged to compound for his estate. He contributed all in his power to the Restoration, and by Charles II. was created earl of Burlington (Bridlington) in 1663. He died in January 1697-8, aged eighty-six.
