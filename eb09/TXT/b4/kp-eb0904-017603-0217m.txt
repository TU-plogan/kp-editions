BOURGES, a city of France, formerly the capital of the province of Berry, and now the chief town of the department of Cher, is situated about 100 miles S. of Paris, at the confluence of the Auron and Yevre, in 47° 4' 59" N. lat. and 2° 32' E. long. The sixty watch-towers by which it was formerly defended have been removed, but it is still surrounded by ramparts laid out as promenades, and its streets are remarkable for the numerous specimens which they preserve of mediaeval architecture. The cathedral, which dates in its earlier portions from the 13th century, is regarded as one of the finest in France, and the Hôtel de Ville, originally the house of Jacques Coeur, the famous jeweller under Charles VIL, is a splendid example of the florid style of the 15th century. The house of the Lallemant family, built about 1520, that of Cujas, the famous jurist, dating from the 16th century, and now used as barracks for the gendarmerie, and the gate of Saint Ours, are also worthy of notice. The archiépiscopal palace, the great prison, and the grand séminaire, new converted into cavalry barracks, are the most important of the other buildings. There are also in the town a museum, a large public library, and a number of colleges. A certain amount of trade is carried on in grain, hemp, wood, skins, wool, and cattle; and cloth, leather, and cutlery are manufactured. There are also several breweries, and the nurseries in the neighbourhood are famous. In 1861 the city became the seat of a military arsenal, which is now of considerable importance. The population, stated at 22,465 in 1851, amounted in 1872 to 27,377. Bourges occupies the site of the Gallic town of Avaricum, mentioned by Caesar as one of the most important of all Gaul. In 52 b.c., during the war of Vercingetorix, it was completely destroyed by the Roman conqueror, but under Augustus it rose again into importance, and was made the capital of Aquitania Prima. In 252 A.D. it became the seat of a bishop, the first occupant of the see being Ursinus. Captured by the Goths in 475, it continued in their possession till about 507. During the English occupation of France in the 15th century it became the residence of Charles VII., who thus acquired the popular title of king of Bourges. In 1463 a university was founded in the city by Louis XI., which continued for centuries to be one of the most famous in France, especially in the department of jurisprudence. On seven different occasions Bourges was the seat of ecclesiastical councils,—the most important being the council of 1438, in which the Pragmatic Sanction of the Gallican Church was established, and that of 1528 in which the Lutheran doctrines were condemned.
