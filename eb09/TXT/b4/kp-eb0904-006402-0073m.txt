BOROVICHI, a town of Russia, in the government of Novgorod, situated in 58° 23' N. lat. and 23° 54' E. long., on both banks of the River Msta. On the site of the present town there existed, from an early date, a settlement famous for the skill of its pilots; and for their encouragement in that occupation the inhabitants were freed from taxation by Peter I. In 1770 the village was raised to the rank of a town, and in 1776 was made the head of a department in the Novgorod government. It contains seven or eight churches and a monastery, an almshouse, and a hospital. Flour, malt, beer, tallow, earthenware, and bricks are all manufactured, but none of them to any great extent. The principal articles of trade are linen, leather, and wood. There are two annual fairs, and a weekly market. Population in 1867, 9108.
