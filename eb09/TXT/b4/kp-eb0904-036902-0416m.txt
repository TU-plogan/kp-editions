BROOKE, Frances, a clever novelist and dramatic writer, whose maiden name was Moore, was born in the earlier part of the 18th century. Of her novels, some of which enjoyed considerable popularity in their day, the most important were The History of Lady Julia Mandeville, Emily Montague, and The Excursion. Her dramatic pieces and translations from the French are now wholly forgotten. She died in Jannary 1789, two days after her husband.
