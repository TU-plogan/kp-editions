BOURCHIER, John, Lord Berners, born about 1474, was grandson and heir of a lord of the same name, who was descended from Thomas of Woodstock, duke of Gloucester, and had been knight of the Garter and constable of Windsor Castle. He was educated at Oxford, and was created a Knight of the Bath on the marriage of the duke of York, second son of Edward IV. He was first known by quelling an insurrection in Cornwall and Devonshire, raised by Michael Joseph, a blacksmith, in 1495, which service recommended him to the favour of Henry VII. He was a captain of the pioneers at the siege of Therouanne under Henry VIII., by whom he was made chancellor of the exchequer for life, and lieutenant of Calais and the Marches. He was appointed to conduct Mary, the king’s sister, into France on her marriage with Louis XII., and had the extraordinary fortune of continuing in favour with Henry VIII. for the space of eighteen years. He died at Calais in 1532, aged 65. By king Henry’s command he translated Froissart’s Chronicle, which was printed in 1523 and 1525 by Pynson, the scholar of Caxton. His other works consisted of translations from French, Spanish, and Italian novels. These were, the History of the most Noble Valyaunt Knyght, Arthur of Lytell Brytayne; the Famous Exploits of Sir Hugh of Bourdeaux; the Golden Boke of Marcus Aurelius; and the Castle of Loue. He composed also a book on the duties of the inhabitants of Calais, and a comedy entitled Ite in Vineam, which used to be acted at Calais after vespers.
