BURGUNDIO, an illustrious jurist of the university of Pisa, sometimes erroneously styled Burgundius. He assisted at the Lateran Council in 1179 and died at a very advanced age in 1194. He was a distinguished Greek scholar, and is considered on the authority of Odofredus to have translated into Latin the various Greek fragments which occur in the Pandects, soon after the Pandects were brought to Bologna, with the exception of those in the 27 th book, the translation of which has been attributed to Modestinus. The Latin translations which have been ascribed to Burgundio were received at Bologna as an integral part of the text of the Pandects, and form part of that known as The Vulgate in distinction from the Florentine text.
