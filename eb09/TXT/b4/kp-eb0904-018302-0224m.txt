BOYER, Jean Pierre, a mulatto general, and for some time the President of Hayti, was born at Port-au-Prince in 1776. He joined the negroes in their war of independence, but after the secession of Toussaint ΓOuverture with his party, was compelled to retire to France. He was well received by Napoleon, and obtained a commission in Leclerc’s expedition. After the death of Dessalines, the king of Hayti, Boyer joined Pêtion in proclaiming a republic and resisting Christophe, Dessalines’s successor. He gallantly and successfully defended Port-au-Prince against the negro troops of Christophe,, and on the death of Pétion was named president of the Haytian republic. Two years later the death of Christophe removed his only rival, and he gained almost undisputed possession of the whole island, Absolute power, however, produced its usual effects; Boyer became arbitrary, capricious, and cruel. In 1825 the French compelled the Hay tian senate to acknowledge their supremacy, and to guarantee a payment of 150 millions of francs in return for certain liberties granted. The weight of this enormous debt excited the greatest discontent in Hayti. Boyer was able to carry on his government for some years longer, but in 1842 a violent insurrection overthrew his power, and compelled him to take refuge in Jamaica. He resided there till 1848, when he removed to Paris, where he died in 1850.
