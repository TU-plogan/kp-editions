BROWN, Robert, the founder of the Brownists, a numerous sect of dissenters in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was born in 1550. He was the son of Anthony Brown of Tolthorp in Rutlandshire, whose father obtained, by a charter of Henry VIII., the singular privilege of wearing his cap in the king’s presence. Robert was educated at Cambridge, and was afterwards a schoolmaster in Southwark. About the year 1580 he began to promulgate his principles of dissent from the Established Church; and the following year he preached at Norwich, where he soon attracted a numerous congregation. His unmeasured assaults upon the Church of England form of government gained for him many followers. His sect daily increasing, Dr Freake, bishop of Norwich, with other ecclesiastical commissioners, called him before them. Being insolent to the court, he was committed to the custody of the sheriff’s officer, but was released at the intercession of his relative the Lord Treasurer Burghley. Brown now left the kingdom, and with permission of the States, settled at Middleburg in Zealand, where he formed a church after his own plan, and preached without molestation. The removal of persecution, however, broke up the unity of the party; numerous sects appeared, and Brown soon returned to England. He fixed his residence at Northampton, where, for his indiscreet attempts to gain proselytes, he was cited by the bishop of Peterborough, and, refusing to appear, was finally excommunicated for contempt. The solemnity of this censure, we are told, immediately effected his reformation. He moved for absolution, which he obtained, and from that time became a dutiful member of the Church of England. T hishappened about the year 1590; and, in a short time afterwards, Brown was preferred to a rectory in Northamptonshire, where he kept a curate, and where he might probably have died in peace; but having some dispute with the constable of his parish relative to the payment of rates, he proceeded to blows, and was afterwards so insolent to the justice, that he was committed to Northampton jail, where he died in 1630, aged eighty. Brown boasted on his death-bed that he had been confined in thirty-two different prisons. He wrote a Treatise of Reformation without tarrying for any, and two other pieces, making together a thin quarto, published at Middleburg in 1582. See Brownists.
