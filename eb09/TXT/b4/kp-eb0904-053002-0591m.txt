BUNZLAU (2.), the chief town of a circle in Bohemia, on the left bank of the Iser, in 50° 25' N. lat. and 14° 54' E. long. It has a town-house and castle, supposed to have been built in the 10th century—which is now used as barracks,—a military hospital, a Piaristic college, and a gymnasium. Its manufactures include cotton, woollen, and linen cloth, leather, and soap. Bunzlau is frequently called Jung Bunzlau to distinguish it from Alt Bunzlau, a village on the Elbe. Population (1869), 8695.
