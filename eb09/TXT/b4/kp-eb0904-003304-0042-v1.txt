BONN, the chief town of a circle of Rhenish Prussia, situated on the left bank of the Rhine, about 16 miles by rail S.S.E. of Cologne. The central part is mostly composed of very narrow streets, but the outskirts contain numerous fine buildings, and the general appearance from the river is rather attractive. There are five Roman Catholic and two Protestant churches, the most important of which is the Minster or St Cassius, an old building in [9:4:34] the Transition style, surmounted by five towers. The town also possesses a “Rathhaus,” of modern erection, a courthouse, a hospital, a gymnasium, and a theatre. By the far the fiuest of its buildings, however, is its famous university, which occupies the larger part of the southern frontage of the town. The present establishment only dates from 1818, and owes its existence to the king of Prussia; but as early as 1786 the academy which had been founded about nine years before was raised by Archbishop Maximilian Frederick of Cologne to the rank of a university, and continued to exercise its functions till 1794, when it was dissolved by the last elector. The building now occupied was originally the electoral palace, constructed about 1717 out of the materials of the old fortifications. It was remodelled after the town came into Prussian possession. There are five faculties in the university—a legal, a medical, and a philosophic, and one of Catholic and another of Protestant theology; in 1873 it was attended by 752 students, ranking as eighth among the German universities. The library numbers upwards of 200,000 volumes; and the antiquarian museum contains a valuable collection of Roman relics discovered in the neighbourhood. A separate building for anatomical operations is situated in the extensive garden to the south of the university; and an academy of agriculture, with a natural history museum and botanic garden attached, is established in the palace of Clemensruhe at Poppelsdorf, which is reached by a fine avenue about a mile long, bordered on both sides by a double row of chestnut trees. A splendid observatory, long under the charge of Argelander, stands on the south side of the road. Among the numerous men of learning who have taught or teach in Bonn are the theologians Bleek and Lange, Hermes and Achterfeldt; the jurists Walter and Booking; Harless, Mayer, and Rindfleisch in the medical faculty; and Niebuhr, Weicker, Ritschl, Brandis, Lassen, Simrock, Diez, and Sybel, in various branches of literature and history. Beethoven was born in the town, and a statue was erected to him in the Miinsterplatz in 1845. Niebuhr is buried in the cemetery outside of the Sternthor, where a monument was placed to his memory by Frederick William IV. But for its university Bonn would be a place of comparatively little importance, its industry and commerce being of moderate dimensions. Its principal manufactures are cotton and silk, earthenware, soap, vitriol, and tobacco; and its trade, chiefly carried on by the Rhine, consists largely of corn and wine. Population in 1871, 26,030. Bonn (Bonna or Castra Bonnensia), originally a town of the Ubii, became at an early period the site of a Roman military settlement, and as such is frequently mentioned by Tacitus. It was the scene, in 70 A.D., of a battle, in which the Romans were defeated by Claudius Civilis, the valiant leader of the Batavians. Greatly reduced by successive barbarian inroads it was restored about 359 by the Emperor Julian, but its importance only dates from 1268, when it became the residence of the electors of Cologne. During the various wars that devastated Germany in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, the town was frequently besieged and occupied by the several belligerents, but continued to belong to the electors till 1794, when the French took possession of it. At the peace of Lunéville they were formally recognized in their occupation; but by the Vienna Congress o f 1814 the town was made over to Prussia. The fortifications had been dismantled in 1717.
