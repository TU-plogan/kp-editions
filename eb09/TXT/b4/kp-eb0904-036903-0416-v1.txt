BROOKE, Henry, novelist and poet, was born at Ranta van, county Cavan, in 1708. His father was rector of Killinkere; his mother was a daughter of the bishop of Elphin. At an early age he entered Dublin University, where he was noticed by Swift, who predicted great things of him. About 1724 he proceeded to London, where he managed to gain the affection and esteem of Pope. He studied law in the Temple, and in 1728 married his ward and cousin, Catherine Meares, a girl of fifteen. His first literary venture appears to have been the poem Universal Beauty (1730), in which there is exceedingly little that can be admired or even tolerated. A much more successful venture was the drama Gustavus Vasa. The prohibition of this play induced the author to publish it, and the sale of the printed copies was enormous. Brooke is said to have cleared 1000 guineas by it. In 1740 his health gave way; he retired to Rantavan, and never returned to his life in London. In 1745 he was made barrack-master at Mullingar, and his well-meant pamphlet, Secret History and Memoirs of the Barracks of Ireland, excited much ill-feeling against him. He spent the remaining years of his life in literary work. His dramas were numerous, and some of them kept the stage for a considerable length of time. The work by which he is best known, The Fool of Quality, began to appear in 1768. It is the product of the matured experience of the author, and though deficient in many of the qualities that go to form the excellence of a work of fiction, it is forcibly and clearly written, and contains much sound and advanced thinking on social problems. Brooke died in 1783. An edition of the Fool of Quality was published in 1859 by the Rev. Charles Kingsley, in whose extravagantly eulogistic preface will be found all the information we have with regard to the author’s life and character.
