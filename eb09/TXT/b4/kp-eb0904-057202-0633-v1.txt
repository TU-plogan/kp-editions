BURU, Boero, or Bouro, an island of the East Indian Archipelago, belonging to the residency of Amboyna, and [9:4:573] situated about 250 miles E. of Celebes. According to Melvill von Carnbée it has an area of 3487 square miles, aud extends from 3° 18' to 3° 50' S. lat. Its surface is for the most part very mountainous, though the seaboard district is frequently alluvial and marshy from the deposits of the numerous rivers by which the island is traversed. Of these, estimated at no less than 125, comparatively few are navigable except the Kayeli or Wai Apoe, which is the largest of all. The principal peaks are the Tomahoe (Kapâla-Lemadang, Saniane or Buru-dome), 8529 feet in height, the Filehet, and the Palamatta. In the middle of the westeru portion of the island lies the large lake of Wakaholo, with a circumference of 37 miles, and a depth of about 100 feet. By far the larger part of the country is covered with natural forest and prairie land, but such portions as have been brought into cultivation are highly fertile. Coffee, rice, and a variety of fruits, such as the lemon, orange, banana, pine-apple, and cocoa-nut are readily grown, as well as sago, red-pepper, tobacco, and cotton. The only important export, however, is cajeput oil, a sudorific distilled from the leaves of the Melaleuca Cajuputi, or white-wood tree, of which about 8000 bottles are manufactured annually and sent to Java and other parts of the archipelago. The native flora is very rich, and the teak, ebony, and canari trees are especially abundant. Among the animals are buffaloes, hogs, deer, crocodiles, lizards, and snakes; and ducks, doves, cockatoos, and birds of paradise are the chief representatives of the feathered species. According to Mr Wallace, the inhabitants are mainly of two partially amalgamated races—Malays on the sea-coast like those of Celebes, and Alfuros in the interior akin to those in Ceram. The latter are still completely pagan, live in scattered hamlets, and have come very little in contact with any civilization. Among the maritime population a small number of Chinese, Arabs, and other races are also to be found. The island is divided by the Dutch into the regencies of Kayeli, Hat, Lumaëteh, Waaisama, Massareteh, Foggi, B.ιra, Licella, Talisa, Ma-rulat, and Leliali. The village of Kayeli is inhabited by eleven Mahometan tribes, who were compelled by Arnold de Vlaming in 1657 to gather together from the different parts of the island, while all the clove-trees were mercilessly exterminated. Before the arrival of the Dutch the islanders were under the dominion of the sultan of Ternate; and it was their rebellion against him that gave the Europeans the opportunity of effecting. their subjugation. In 1854 the port of Kayeli was declared free to all nations without customs on either ship or cargo.
