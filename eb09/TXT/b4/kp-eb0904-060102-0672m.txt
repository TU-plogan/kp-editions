BUXTON, Sir Thomas Fowell (1786-1845), a distinguished philanthropist, whose name is inseparably associated with that of Wilberforce in the abolition of slavery, was born in Essex, April 1,1786. He was not educated at any of the public schools, and at about the age of eighteen he entered Trinity College, Dublin, with a very slender stock of acquirements. But he was aware of his defects, and laboured so earnestly that he came out one of the first meu of his time, and with an extraordinarily high reputation as a speaker. In 1809 he married Harriet Gurney, sister of the celebrated Mrs Fry. A3 his own means were not of themselves sufficient to support his family, he entered in 1808 the brewery establishment of Truman, Hanbury, and Co., of which his uncles, the Hanburys, were partners. He devoted himself to business with characteristic enthusiasm, became a partner in 1811, and soon had the whole concern in his hands. In 1816 he brought himself into notice by his speech in behalf of the Spitalfields weavers, and in 1818 he published his able Inquiry into Prison Discipline. The same year he was elected member for Weymouth, a borough for which he continued to sit till 1837. Iu the House of Commons he had a high reputation as an able and straightforward speaker, devoted to philanthropic schemes. Of these plans the most important was that for the abolition of slavery in the British colonies. Buxton devoted his life to this object, and through defeat and opposition, despite the attacks of enemies and the remonstrances of faint-hearted friends, he remained true to it. Not till 1833 was he successful, and even then only partially, for he was compelled to admit some clauses against which his better judgment had decided. In 1837 he ceased to sit in the House of Commons. He travelled on the Continent in 1839 to recruit his health, which had given way, and took the opportunity of inspecting Continental prisons. He was made a baronet in 1840, and then devoted himself to a plan for ameliorating the condition of the African negroes, The failure of the Niger expedition was a blow from which he never recovered. He died on the 19th February 1845. (See Memoir and Correspondence of Sir T. F. Buxton, edited by his son, Charles Buxton, 1848.)
