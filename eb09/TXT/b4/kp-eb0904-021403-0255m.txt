BRANDE, William Thomas, chemist, was born at London in 1788. After leaving Westminster school he spent some time on the Continent, and acquired a knowledge of French and German. On his return he began the study of medicine, and in 1806 a communication of his to the Royal Society was printed in their Transactions. In 1809 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society, and became assistant to Sir Humphrey Davy at the Royal Institution. He succeeded Davy in the chair of chemistry in 1813, and in the same year received the Copley medal of the Royal Society. From 1816 to 1836 he was joint editor with Faraday of the Quarterly Journal of Science and Art. In 1825 he was made superintendent of the die department in the Mint, and in 1853 he received the honorary degree of D.C.L. of Oxford. He died on the 11th February 1866. Besides numerous papers, which marked him out as one of the most vigorous and able chemists of the day, Brande was the author of several important works. The Manual of Chemistry, 1819, and Elements of Chemistry, 1831, were the best works of the time, and soon became popular. He also published a Dictionary of Materia Medica in 1839, and a Dictionary of Science, Literature, and Art in 1842. The latter is an exceedingly able and valuable work of reference; a new edition of it has recently appeared under the editorship of Mr G. W. Cox, 1875. Brande was the author of the third of the Dissertations (that on the progress of Chemical philosophy) prefixed to the supplement of the fourth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.
