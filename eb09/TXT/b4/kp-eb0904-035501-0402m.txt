BRITTON ", the title of the earliest summary of the law of England in the French tongue, which purports to have been written by command of King Edward I. The origin and authorship of the work have been much disputed. It has been attributed to John le Breton, bishop of Hereford, on the authority of a passage foαnd in some MSS. of the history of Matthew of Westminster; there are difficulties, however, involved in this theory, inasmuch as the bishop of Hereford died in 1275 (3 Edward I.), whereas allusions are made in Britton to several statutes passed after that time, and more particularly to the well-known statute “Quia emptores terrarum,” which was passed in 18 Edward I. It was the opinion of Selden that the book derived its title from Henry de Bracton, the last of the chief justiciaries, whose name is sometimes spelled in the Fine Rolls Bratton and Bretton, and that it was a independence. The 9th and 10th centuries are mainly remarkable for the wars that were continually breaking out between Brittany and the rising duchy of Normandy. Though Alan V. of Brittany had been intrusted with the guardianship of the youthful William of Normandy, and had fulfilled his trust to the full, yet under his successors Conan II., Hoel V., and Alan Fergent, the old enmity between the two countries broke out again and again. On the death in 1148 of Conan III., who had been defeated in a contest with his rebellious nobles, the succession was disputed by Hoel VI. andlis brother-in-law, the count of Porhoet. The partizans of the former on their defeat submitted to Henry II. of England, who bestowed the royal abridgment of Bracton’s great work on the customs and laws of England, with the addition of certain subsequent statutes. The arrangement, however, of the two works is different, and but a small proportion of Bracton’s work is incorporated in Britton. The work is entitled in an early MS. of the 14th century, which was once in the possession of Selden, and is now in the Cambridge University Library, “Summa de legibus Anglie que vocatur Bretone and it is described as “a book called Bretoun” in the will of Andrew Horn, the learned chamberlain of the city of London, who bequeathed it to the chamber of the Guildhall in 3 Edward III., together with another book called the Mirroir des Justices. Britton was first printed in London by Robert Redman, without a date, probably about the year 1530. Another edition of it was printed in 1640, corrected by Edmund Wingate. A third edition of it, with an English translation, has been lately published at the University Press, Oxford, 1865, by F. Μ. Nicholls, Μ. A. An English translation of the work without the Latin text had been previously published by R. Kelham in 1762.
