BROWN, William Laurence, born at Utrecht, January 7, 1755, was the son of the Rev. William Brown, minister of the English church in that city. The father, having been appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at St Andrews, returned to Scotland in 1757, and his son was in due time sent to the grammar school of that city. At the age of twelve he entered the university, and after passing through the classes of divinity, removed in 1774 to the university of Utrecht, where he combined with the study of theology that of the civil law. In 1777 he was appointed to the charge of the English church in Utrecht, which had been previously held by his father and uncle. About 1788 he was appointed to the professorship of moral philosophy and ecclesiastical history in the university of Utrecht, to which was soon added the professorship of the law of nature. The war which followed the French Revolution finally drove Dr Brown from the place of his nativity. In January 1795 he made his escape to England. In London he experienced such a reception as was due to his literary talents and moral worth; and in 1795 the magistrates of Aberdeen appointed him to the chair of divinity on the retirement of Dr George Campbell, and soon after he [9:4:389] was made principal of Maπschal College. In the year 1800 he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, and in 1804 dean of the chapel royal, and of the Order of the Thistle. He died on the 11th of May 1830, in the seventy-sixth year of his age.

II is most widely known works were an Essaτj on the Natural Equality of Men, 1793, which gained the Teyler Society’s prize; a treatise On the Existence of the Supreme Creator, 1816, to which was awarded the first Burnet prize of £1250; and Λ Comparative View of Christianity, and of the other Forms of Religion which have existed and still exist in the World, particularly with regard to their Moral Tendency, 1826.
