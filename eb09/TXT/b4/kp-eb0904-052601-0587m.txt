BUNTING, Jabez, D.D., a distinguished Wesleyan minister, who exerted an influence in his denomination second only to that of John Wesley himself, was born at Manchester 13th May 1779, and died on the 16th June 1858. He was educated at the grammar school of his native town. At the age of nineteen he began to preach, and a year later (1799) he became a member of the Conference. He continued in the active discharge of his ministerial duties for upwards of fifty-seven years—his successive spheres of labour being Manchester, Liverpool, and London. In 1834 he was appointed president of the newly-founded Wesleyan theological college, and in this position, which he held till his death, he succeeded in materially raising the standard of education among Wesleyan ministers. He was four times chosen to be president of the Conference, was repeatedly secretary of the “Legal Hundred,” and for eighteen years was secretary to the Wesleyan Missionary Society. In these and other offices he found ample scope for that great natural sagacity and power of administration which did so much for the consolidation and extension of the Wesleyan denomination. Dr Bunting was a popular preacher, and an effective platform speaker. Two volumes of his sermons were published posthumously in 1862. The first volume of a memoir, by his son, appeared in 1860.
