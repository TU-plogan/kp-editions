BONI, a kingdom or confederation in the island of Celebes, stretching along a part of the western shores of a great bay of the same name, which indents the south side of the island to the depth of nearly 180 miles. It has an area of 450 square miles at most, and its present population is estimated about 200,000. It was at one time the most powerful state of Celebes, all the other princes being regarded as vassals of its king, but has latterly been practically reduced to a Dutch dependency, though this has not been brought about without trouble. An expedition in 1825, under General van Geen, was not very successful; but the war of 1859 was brought to a more satisfactory termination for the invaders. The inhabitants, called Bugis, are one of the most remarkable of the peoples of the Eastern Archipelago. They speak a language allied to that of the Macassars, and write it with similar characters. It has been studied and its letters reproduced in type by Dr B. F. Matthes of the Netherlands Bible Society. The Bugis are industrious and ingenious; they practise agriculture more extensively than the neighbouring tribes, and manufacture cotton cloth, not only for their own use. but also [9:4:33] for export. They likewise carry on a considerable traffic in the mineral and vegetable productions of their country, such as gold dust, tortoise-shell, pearlβ, nutmegs, camphor, and various medicinal preparations. Their towns are regularly built, and they have schools of their own. The king is elected generally for life, and always from their own number, by the chiefs of the eight petty states that compose the confederation, and he cannot decide upon any public measure without their consent. In some of the states the office of chief is hereditary; in others any member of the privileged classes may aspire to the dignity, and it not unfrequently happens that the state comes to be governed by a woman. The capital, also called Boni, is situated on the coast in 4° 37' S. lat. and 120° 30' E. long., and is the residence of the king. Various Dutch settlements have been formed round the bay. Of the history of Boni not much is known. According to Temminck, it first acquired importance in the year 1666, when the rajah Palakkah, whose father and grandfather had been murdered by the family of Hassan, the tyrant of Sumatra, made common cause with the Dutch against that despot. From that date till the beginning of the present century the Dutch influence in the kingdom remained undisputed. In 1814, however, Boni fell into the hands of the British, who retained it for two years; but by the European treaties concluded on the downfall of Napoleon it reverted to its original colonizers. See Celebes.
