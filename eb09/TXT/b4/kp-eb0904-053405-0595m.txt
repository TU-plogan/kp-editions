BURGOS, the capital formerly of the kingdom of Old Castile, and now of a separate province, stands on the slope of a hill, the base of which is skirted by the River Arlanzon, 75 miles from Madrid, in lat. 42° 21' N., long. 3° 43' W. It is a considerable town, consisting of about 1400 houses, originally girt into the form of a segment of a circle by a wall, some portions of which still remain. On the opposite bank of the river, and connected with the more ancient part of the town by three stone bridges, are the suburbs (Barrio de la Vega), tastefully laid out in pleasure-grounds, while lower down in the midst of the stream is an island furnished with seats and walks as a public promenade. The streets and squares are exceedingly irregular, although spacious and well built. The principal square is the Plaza Mayor, or Plaza de la Constitucion, in the centre of which is a bronze statue of Charles II. The most important public building is the cathedral, begun by Bishop Maurice, traditionally an Englishman, in 1221, but not completed till 1567. It is built in an irregular florid Gothic style, and contains eight chapels, the most famous of which is the Capilla del Condes table, containing the tombs of several of the Velasco family, the hereditary constables of Castile. (See View and Plan in Street’s Gothic Architecture of Spain, and history by Orcajo, Historia de la Catedral de Burgos.) Besides the cathedral there is the Hotel de Ville, or Casa de Ayuntamiento (where the bones ®f the Cid and his wife are preserved in a walnut case),the Palace of Velasco, the church of St Paul, and a beautiful Doric arch, erected in honour of Fernando Gonzalez. There is a fine approach to the city through the massive gate of Santa Maria, surmounted by a statue of the Virgin and Child, and with figures of Fernando Gonzalez, Charles I., the Cid, and Diego Porcelos in the niches. The hospitals of Burgos are seven in number, and well supported; they are the Hospital San Juan (founded in 1479), the Hospital de la Conception, San Julian, San Quirce, Del Rey, Militär, and the Hospicio y Casa de Epositos. The educational wants of the district are supplied by four primary schools, which are liberally endowed from the municipal funds, and give -gratuitous instruction to a considerable number of pupils. There is also a normal school and [9:4:535] a Seminario Conciliar, in which tho higher branches arc taught. But the most important educational establishment is the Instituto Superior which has a staff of 21 professors, and annually enrols about 250 students. The university, founded in 1550 and restored in 1776, has been long defunct. Burgos is the see of an archbishop, who has for his suffragans the bishops of Pamplona, Palencia, Santander, and Tudela. It has several monasteries, amongst which may be mentioned San Pablo, built about 1415 and now occupied as a store; La Merced, converted into a hospital; the Monasterio de Fredesval, and others. About two miles distant from the town stands the Carthusian convent of Miraflores, built in room of an earlier erection about 1480-7; whilst a little below the promenade of the Isla stands the Santa Maria la Real de las Huelgas, founded by Alphonso VIII., the abbess of which was invested with almost royal prerogatives, and held an unlimited sway over more than fifty villages. Burgos is the official residence of a military staff, and is well provided with barracks and storehouses. The jurisdiction of its courts extends over the whole audienda, including Alava, Guipuzcoa, Logrono, Santander, Soria, and Biscay.

Besides furnishing a mart for the agricultural produce of the neighbouring districts, Burgos carries on a considerable export trade in linen and woollen stuffs, made in imitation of English goods. The principal articles of manufacture are paper, hats, stockings, and leather goods. Its population, which is said at one time to have numbered 80,000, amounted to 25,721 at the census of 1860, which was an increase of 10,931 since 1845.

The history of Burgos cannot be carried back beyond the end of the 9th century. There is no trace of its existence during the occupation of Spain by the Romans. We find the nucleus of it existing in 884, when Diego Porcelos, at the command of Alphonso the Great, built a castle on the right bank of the Arlanzon to check the progress of the Moors. From that time forward it steadily increased in importance, reaching the height of its prosperity in the 15 th century, when, alternately with Toledo, it was occupied as a royal residence, but rapidly declining when the court was finally removed to Madrid. Being on one of the principal military roads of the kingdom, it suffered severely during the Peninsular War. In 1808 it was the scene of the defeat of the Spanish army by the French under Marshal Soult. It was unsuccessfully besieged by Wellington in 1812, but was surrendered to him at the opening of the campaign of the following year. (See Waring, Architectural Studies in Burgos.}
