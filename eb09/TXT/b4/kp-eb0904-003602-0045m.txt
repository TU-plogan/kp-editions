BONNIVARD, François de, the “prisoner of Chillon,” was born at Seyssel in 1496. Educated at Turin, he succeeded, in 1510, to the priory of St Victor, just outside the walls of Geneva, his uncle having resigned in his favour. Of ardent republican principles he espoused the cause of the Genevese against the duke of Savoy, who was seeking to assert the seignorial rights that had just been ceded to him by the prince bishop. In 1519, on the entrance of the duke into Geneva, Bonnivard was arrested and imprisoned for two years at Grolée. On his liberation he returned to his priory. In 1530, when travelling in the service of the republic, he was unfortunate enough to fall into the hands of robbers, who delivered him over once more to the duke of Savoy. His imprisonment in the castle of Chillon, which has been celebrated in Byron’s poem, lasted till 1536, when he was liberated by the combined force of the Bernese and Genevese. On his return to Geneva, which had now completely emancipated itself, he received the honours and rewards that were due to his patriotism, being made a member of the Council of Two Hundred, and endowed with a pension. He died about 1570, the precise date being uncertain. Bonnivard was the author of a history of Geneva, and left his books and manuscripts to the town.
