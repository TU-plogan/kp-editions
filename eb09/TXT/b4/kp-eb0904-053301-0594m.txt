BURGERSDYK, or Burgersdicius, Francis, a celebrated Dutch logician, was born at Lier, near Delft, in 1590, and died at Leyden in 1629, in the thirty-ninth year of his age. He studied at the university of Leyden, and after completing his academical career there with great distinction, travelled through Germany and France. On arriving at Saumur in the latter country he began to study theology, and was so successful, that, while still a very young man, he was appointed professor of philosophy in that town. This office he held for five years, at the end of which period he returned to Leyden, where he accepted the chair of logic and moral philosophy, and afterwards that of natural philosophy. His Logic was at one time widely used, and is still a very valuable compendium. His treatise on ethics, entitled Idea Phdosophi oe Moralis, was published posthumously in 1644.
