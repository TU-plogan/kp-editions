BRAINTREE, the Raines of Domesday Book, a markettown of Essex, eleven miles N. by E. of Chelmsford. It is one of the polling-places for North Essex, and is the seat of the Braintree Poor Law Union. The parish church, St Michael’s, is a fine Gothic edifice of early date. A corn exchange and a mechanics’ institute may also be mentioned. The bishops of London had at one time a palace in the town, but there are no remains of the building. The manufactures of silk and crape, which employ about 1000 persons, have quite superseded that of woollen cloth, which was introduced by the Flemings who fled to England to escape the persecution of the duke of Alva. Straw-plaiting is also carried on. There is a free school in the town, besides several charities. Two annual fairs of three days each are held here, commencing May 7 and October 2. Population of the parish in 1871, 4790.
