BUSBECQ, Augier Ghislen de (1522-1592), a Flemish diplomatist and traveller, was born at Commines in 1522, and was educated at the universities of Louvain, Paris, Venice, Bologna, and Padua. He was engaged in several important employments and negotiations, and in particular was twice sent as ambassador by the Emperor Ferdinand I. to the court of Soliman II. He made a collection of curious inscriptions and manuscripts; and in his second journey to Constantinople he carried with him an artist to make drawings of the rarest plants and animals. In 1562 he returned to Vienna, and was appointed tutor to the sons of the Emperor Maximilian II. Busbecq died at St Germain, near Rouen, October 28, 1592. He wrote a Discourse of the State of the Ottoman Kmpire, and a Relation of his Two Journeys to Turkey. A translation of the Travels in Turkey was published in Glasgow by Robert Urie in 1761.
