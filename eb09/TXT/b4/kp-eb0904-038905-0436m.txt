BROWNE, Sir Thomas, a distinguished English writer, was born in London on the 19th October, 1605. He was educated at Winchester School, and afterwards at Broadgate Hall (Pembroke College), Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in January 1626. He took the further degree of Μ. A. in 1629, studied medicine, and practised for some time in Oxfordshire. Between 1630 and 1633 he left England, travelled through Ireland, France, and Italy, and on his way home received the degree of M.D. at the university of Leyden. He returned to London in 1634, and two years later, after a short residence in Yorkshire, settled in practice at Norwich. In 1642 a copy of his Religio Medici was printed from one of his MSS. without his knowledge, and he was compelled to put forth a correct edition of the work, which appears to have been composed as early as 1634. Its success was very great, and the author at once became celebrated as a man of letters. In 1646 appeared his Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into Vulgar and Common Errors, which added to his fame. In 1658, on the occasion of the discovery of some ancient urns in Norfolk, he wrote his Hydriotaphia or Umburial, to which was appended The Garden of Cyrus. These four works were all that he published, though several tracts, [9:4:390] notably the Christian Morals and Antiquities of Norwich, were prepared for publication, and appeared after his death. In 1671 he received the honour of knighthood from Charles II. on his visit to Norwich; and in 1682 he died on his seventy-seventh birthday.

Browne is in every way a remarkable and peculiar writer. His writings are among the few specimens of purely literary work produced during a period of great political excitement and discord. England was passing through, its greatest convulsion; events of mighty moment were being transacted round him, and he remained placidly indifferent. While the grandest minds of his country were busied with the important affairs of state, he was revising his Religio Medici, and his book was published in the very year in which the civil war broke out. While England was torn with civil discord, and the liberty of her children was being bought with their blood, Browne serenely pursued his studies at Norwich, to all appearance as indifferent to contemporary events as if he had belonged to another planet. Just when there came a lull in the conflict, when the royal power was broken, and the air was filled with doubts, anxieties, and negotiations, Browne published his Pseudodoxia Epidemica. The death of the king, the expulsion of the parliament, the establishment of the protectorate, passed by him like a breath which he heeded not. But the unearthing of some sepulchral urns at once roused his attention, and furnished occasion for a train of most magnificent and majestic reflections on the short space of human life, on the signs and symbols of mortality. A mind like this is a psychological curiosity, and its peculiarities are faithfully reflected in the form and matter of his - works. In some respects, of course, he resembles his contemporaries; in his, as in all other writings of the 17th century, there is a plentiful display of erudition, copious citation of authorities, and lavish quotation from older writers. Some part also of the peculiarity of his style may be ascribed to the general tendency of the language at that period. It was a time of unusual richness of diction; great writers did not hesitate to coin words and phrases as occasion required them, and ample raw material was supplied by the great mass of literature, which had been but recently opened up, and which was then being assimilated. But Browne stands apart from his contemporaries by reason of the peculiar and unique cast of his mind. Deeply speculative, imbued with the Platonic mysticism which taught him to look upon this world as only the image, the shadow of an invisible system, he regarded the whole of experience but as food for contemplation. Nothing is too great or too small, too far removed or too near at hand for him; all finds a place in the universe of being, which he seems to regard almost from the position of an outsider. His general mood may be characterized as the metaphysical; not that he speculated systematically on the problems 'of existence, but because lie dwells repeatedly, and with evident delight, upon what transcends the little sphere of our life, and, like Shakespeare, is fond of meditating on the outward and visible signs of mortality, and on what lies beyond the grave.

Of Browne, however, as of our greatest writers, it is true that the style is the man. The form of his thought is as peculiar and remarkable as the matter; the two, indeed, react upon one another. It is a style altogether unique,— rich, with a lavish use of metaphor and analogy—majestic and swelling, and with a fine antique flavour about it. Much of its quaintness, no doubt, depends on the excessive employment of Latinized words, great part of which have never succeeded in making their way into the standard language; but the peculiarities of the vocabulary do not entirely exhaust those of the style. Of his four masterpieces the Religio Medici is that in which we are most in contact with the writer himself. The book was a puzzle to contemporaries, and is still hard to understand. It is the confession of faith of a mind keen and sceptical in some aspects, but on the whole deeply imbued with the sense of the mysteriousness of true religion, and willing to yield itself up without reserve to the requirements of faith. “I love/’ he says, “to lose myself in a mystery, to pursue my reason to an 0, Altitudo !” The Vulgar Errors is a wonderful storehouse of out-of-the-way facts and scraps of erudition, exhibiting a singular mixture of credulity and shrewdness. The style is more direct and simple than in the other works. The Garden of Cyrus is a continued illustration of one quaint conceit. The whole universe is ransacked for examples of the Quincunx, and he discovers, as Coleridge says, “quincunxes in heaven above, quincunxes in earth below, quincunxes in the mind of man, quincunxes in tones, in optic nerves, in roots of trees, in leaves, in everything !” But the whole strength of his genius and the wonderful charm of his style are to be sought in the Vmburial, the concluding chapter of which, for richness of imagery and majestic pomp of diction, can hardly be paralleled in the English language. For anything at all resembling it we must turn to the finest passages of Jeremy Taylor or of Milton’s prose writings.

The best edition of Sir T. Browne is that by Simon Wilkin, 4 vols., 1836,—3 vols. (Bohn), 1851, where full biographical and bibliographical information will be found. Prefixed to it is Johnson’s celebrated Life.
