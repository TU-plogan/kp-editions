BRAZZA, the ancient Brattia, an island in the Adriatic, off the coast of Dalmatia, in the circle of Spalatro, and eight miles from that city. It has an area of 170 square miles, and a population of 15,500. The surface is rugged and mountainous, but is industriously cultivated, and its wine is accounted the best in Dalmatia. It produces also oil, figs, almonds, and saffron; but the corn crop scarcely supplies the wants of the inhabitants for three months. There are about twelve or thirteen hamlets in the island, the most important being San Pietro, Neresi, Bol, and Miln√§.
