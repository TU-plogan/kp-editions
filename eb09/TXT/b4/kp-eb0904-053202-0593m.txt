BURG, a town of Prussian Saxony, on the River Ihle, and on the railway from Berlin to Magdeburg, 14 miles N.E. of the latter. It has long been noted for its woollen manufactures, which afford employment to a great part of its population. The town formerly belonged to the Querfurt principality, but was ceded to Brandenburg in 1687. It owes its prosperity to the large influx of industrious French, Palatinate, and Walloon refugees, which took place in the end of the 17 th century. Population in 1871, 15,184.
