BREST, a strongly fortified seaport town of France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Finistère, in 48° 22' N. lat. and 4° 32' W. long. It is situated to the north of a magnificent land-locked bay, and occupies the slopes of two hills divided by the River Penfeld,—the part of the town on the left bank being regarded as Brest proper, while the part on the right is known as Recouvrance, from the chapel of the Virgin, to whom the shipwrecked sailors used to address their prayers for the recovery of their property. The hill-sides are in some places so steep that the ascent from the lower to the upper town has to be effected by flights of stairs; and the second or third story of one house is often on a level with the ground story of the next. The town proper has three long parallel streets, of which the chief bears the name of Rue de Siam, in honour of the Siamese embassy sent to Louis XIV., and terminates at the remarkable swingbridge, or Pont Impérial, constructed in 1861, which crosses the mouth of the Penfeld. Running along the shore to the south of the town is the Cours d’Ajot, one of the finest promenades of its kind in France, named after the engineer who constructed it. It is planted with trees and [9:4:260] adorned with two marble statues presented by the “Gouvernement Consulaire, Le XIIII e . Germinal, An IX.” Brest possesses comparatively few buildings of importance, with the exception of those connected with the great naval establishment. The church of the priory of the Seven Saints, the church of St Louis, the old castle with its seven massive towers (dating in part from the 13th century), the exchange, the town-house, the civil hospital, and the theatre are the chief. The great convict establishment, which formerly held some 3000 prisoners, was vacated in 1860, and is now used as a store-house. The Government dockyard is very extensive, and contains a sail-loft, a slopshop, a ropery, a foundry and steam-factory, seamen’s barracks (known as La Cayenne), and three dry-docks partly excavated in the hill-side. The Hôpital de la Marine, built between 1824 and 1835, contains 26 wards, each with 53 beds, and is under the management of a large band of sisters of mercy. Among the minor establishments are a lyceum, a school of navigation, a medico-chirurgical school, an observatory, a botanical garden, a public library of 25,000 volumes, and two others of 18,000 and 10,000. The manufactures are few, and the trade is of small extent considering the excellence of the ports. The former are chiefly leather, wax-cloth, paper, and rope; and the latter deals mainly in grain, beer, brandy, and fish. Napoleon III. did much for the development of the commerce of Brest, though his extensive plans for a new port, on which £600,000 were expended during his reign, have been only partially carried out. It lies at the foot of the Cours d’Ajot, and has thus much greater scope for any necessary development than the old port, which was formed by the mouth of the Penfeld. The roadstead of Brest, which is in some places three miles broad, and has an area of 15 square leagues, is formed by the promontory of Finistère on the N. and that of Kélernn on the S. It breaks up into numerous smaller bays or arms, formed by the embouchures of streams, the most important being the Anse de Kélernn, the Anse de Poulmie, and the months of the Châteaulin, the Dolas, the Lauberlach, and the Landerneau. It is defended on every side by batteries and forts, the first system of which was erected in 1680 under the personal superintendence of Vauban. The only entrance, the Goulet, is about a mile wide; but the Mingant or Mingam rock in the middle compels vessels to pass under the batteries of either the one side or the other. In 1851 the population of the town was 36,500; in 1871 it was 66,272.

Nothing definite is known of Brest till about 1040, when it was ceded by the Count of Léon to the first duke of Brittany. In 1372 duke John IV. gave it up to the English on condition that they should restore it when peace was proclaimed. So important did he consider the place that he declared, “He is not duke of Brittany who is not lord of Brest.” On the death of Edward III. the castle was made over to the dukes; but when war was once more declared between France and England, an English garrison took possession again, and repelled every effort to dislodge it; nor was the place surrendered till 1397, and then only in consideration of a heavy ransom. In the next century it was again captured by the English, and retaken by the French; and by the marriage of Louis XII. with Anne of Brittany, it passed to the French crown. The advantages of the situation for a seaport town were first recognized by Richelieu, who, in 1631, constructed a harbour with wooden wharves, which soon became a station of the French navy. Colbert changed the wooden wharves for masonry, and otherwise improved the port, and Vauban’s fortifications followed in 1680-88. In 1694 an English squadron, under Berkeley, was miserably defeated in attempting a landing; but in 1794, during the revolutionary war, the French fleet, under Villaret de Joyeuse, was as thoroughly beaten in the same place by the English admiral Howe.
