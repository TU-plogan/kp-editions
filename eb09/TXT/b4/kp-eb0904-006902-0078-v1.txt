BOSSI, Giuseppe Carlo Aurelio, Baron de, an Italian poet and diplomatist, was born at Turin, November 15, 1758. He made his first appearance as poet at the age of eighteen by the publication of two tragedies, Lea Silvia and I C ir cassi ; and four years later he took the degree of doctor of laws. In 1781, in consequence of his ode in praise of the edict of toleration promulgated by the Emperor Joseph IL, he was banished the kingdom; but having rendered during his exile an important service to his countrymen he was recalled and appointed undersecretary of state for foreign affairs. In 1792, on occasion of the French invasion, he was sent to the court of Prussia to negotiate an alliance, and thence went as ambassador to St Petersburg. Dismissed by the emperor in consequence of the treaty of alliance between Sardinia and France (1797), he was named ambassador to Venice, which he reached only in time to witness the fall of the republic. He was next appointed envoy to General Bonaparte in Italy. After the conquest of Sardinia Bossi was a member of the Provisional Government, and one of the three deputies sent to Paris to petition for annexation to France. The Russian invasion of 1799 drove him to take refuge in the Vaudois valleys. He was afterwards a member of the Provisional. Government, but retired in 1802. Three years later he was made prefect of the Ain; he was created baron by Napoleon I. in 1810, and was afterwards transferred to the prefecture of La Manche. Deprived on the second return of the Bourbons, he came to England, but returned to France the following year. He spent his remaining years in retirement. Besides the works above mentioned Bossi was author of a long poem entitled Oromasia, on the events of the French revolution; Monaca, a poem on the secularization of convents (1787); and various lyrical pieces, among which are Independenza Americana (1785), 0landa Pacificata (1788), Vision (1799), &c. He died at Paris, January 20, 1823.
