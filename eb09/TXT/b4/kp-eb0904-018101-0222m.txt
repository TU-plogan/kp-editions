BOWRING, Sir John, an eminent English linguist, translator, political economist, and miscellaneous writer, was born at Exeter, October 17, 1792. He was a descendant of an old Puritan family; and he became in early life an ardent disciple in the school of utilitarianism and philosophical radicalism, whose prophet was Jeremy Bentham. He did not, however, share his master’s contempt for poetry and the belles lettres, but was a diligent student of literature and foreign languages, especially those of Eastern Europe. His attainments as a linguist were of remarkable extent. He stated that he knew two hundred languages and could speak one hundred. This, of course, does not mean more than that he had some slight acquaintance with them; but it is certain that he had a pretty good knowledge of forty, and these were languages of various classes. This gives him a place, with Mezzofanti and Von Gabelentz, among the greatest linguists of the world. The first fruits of his study of foreign literature appeared in Specimens of the Russian Poets, published in two volumes in 1821-23. These were speedily followed by Batavian Anthology (1824), Ancient Poetry and Romances of Spain (1824), Specimens of the Polish Poets, and Servian Popular Poetry, both in 1827. During this period he began to contribute to the newly-founded Westminster Review, of which he was appointed editor in 1825. By his contributions to the Review he obtained considerable reputation as political economist and parliamentary reformer. He advocated in its pages the cause of free trade long before it was popularized by the eloquence of Richard Cobden and John Bright. He pleaded earnestly in behalf of parliamentary reform, Catholic emancipation, and popular education. In 1828 he visited Holland, and during his stay there the university of Groningen conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws. In the following year he was in Denmark, occupying himself with preparations for the publication of a collection of Scandinavian poetry. Bowring, who had been the trusted friend of Bentham during his life, was appointed his literary executor, and was charged with the task of preparing a collected edition of his works. This appeared in eleven volumes in the years 1838 aud 1839. Meanwhile Bowring had entered Parliament in 1835 as member for Kilmarnock; and in the following year he was appointed head of a Government commission to be sent to France to inquire into the actual state of commerce between the two countries. He was engaged in similar investigations in Switzerland, Italy, Syria, and some of the German States. The results of these missions appeared in a series of reports laid before the House of Commons. After a retirement of four years he sat in Parliament from 1841 till 1849 as member for Bolton. During this busy period he found leisure for literature, and published in 1843 a translation of the Manuscript of the Queen's Court, a collection of old Bohemian lyrics, &c. In 1849 he was appointed British consul at Hong-Kong, and superintendent of trade iu China, a post which ho held for four years. After his return he distinguished himself as an advocate of the decimal system, and published a work entitled, The Decimal System in Numbers, Coins, and Accounts (1854). The introduction of the florin as a preparatory step was chiefly due to his efforts. Knighted in 1854, he was again sent the same year to Hong-kong as governor, invested with the supreme military and naval power. It was during his governorship that a dispute broke out with the Chinese; and the irritation caused by his “spirited” or high-handed policy led to the second war with China. In 1855 he visited Siam, and negotiated with the king a treaty of commerce. After the usual five years of service he retired and received a pension. His last employment by the English Government was as a commissioner to Italy in 1861, to report on our commercial relations with the new kingdom. Sir John Bowring subsequently accepted the appointment of minister plenipotentiary and envoy extraordinary from the Hawaiian Government to the courts of Europe, and in this capacity negotiated treaties with Belgium, Holland, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland. In addition to the works already named he published— Poetry of the Magyars (1830); Cheskian Anthology (1832); The Kingdom and People of Siam (1859); a translation of Peter Schlemihl; translations from the Hungarian poet·, Alexander Petöfi (1866); and various pamphlets. He was elected F.R.S. and F.R.G.S., and received the decorations of several foreign orders of knighthood. Bowring was twice married; his second wife survived him, with several sons, who have attained distinction in various fields. He died at Claremont, near Exeter, November 23, 1872.
