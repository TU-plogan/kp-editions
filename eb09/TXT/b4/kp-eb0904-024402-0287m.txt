BREDA, Jan Van, a Dutch painter, was the son cf Alexander Van Breda, an artist of considerable merit, and was born at Antwerp in 1683. He imitated the style of Wouvermans and Breughel with such dexterity, that even connoisseurs are often unable to distinguish his copies of their pictures from the originals. He visited England, where he was so well employed, that in a few years he was able to retire to his native country with a competency. The earl of Derwentwater was one of his chief patrons. He died at Antwerp in 1750.
