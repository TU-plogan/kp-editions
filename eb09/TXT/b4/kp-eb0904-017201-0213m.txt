BOULTON, Matthew, manufacturer and practical engineer, was born at Birmingham on the 14th of September 1728. He was called early into active life upon the death of his father in 1745, and soon found ample scope for the exercise of his inventive faculties in improving the manufactures of his native place. His first attempt was a new mode of inlaying steel; and he succeeded in obtaining a considerable demand for the products of his manufactory, which were principally exported to the Continent, and not uncommonly re-imported for domestic use as of foreign manufacture.

In 1762, his fortune being already considerable, he purchased a tract of barren heath in the neighbourhood of Birmingham, with a single house on it, and there founded, at the expense of £9000, the manufactory which flourished so long and was so well known under the name of Soho. His workmen were at first principally employed in the imitation of ormolu, ard in copying oil paintings with great accuracy, by means of a mechanical process which was invented by a Mr Eggington, who afterwards distinguished himself by various works in stained glass. Boulton finding the horse-power inadequate to the various purposes of his machinery erected, in 1767, a steam-engine, upon the original construction of Savary, which, notwithstanding the inconvenience of a great loss of steam from condensation, by its immediate contact with the water raised, has still some advantages from the simplicity of the apparatus it requires, and has been found to succeed well upon a small scale. But Boulton’s objects required a still more powerful machine, and he had the discernment to perceive that they might be very completely attained by the adoption of the various improvements made in the steam-engine by James Watt of Glasgow, who had obtained a patent for them in 1769, the privileges of which were extended in 1775, by an Act of Parliament, to a term of twenty-five years. Boulton induced the great inventor to remove to Birmingham. They commenced a partnership in business, and established a manufactory of steam-engines, in which accurate execution kept pace so well with judicious design, that its productions continued to be equally in request with the public after the expiration of [9:4:173] the term of that legal privilege which at first gave the proprietors the exclusive right of supplying them, and which had been confirmed in 1792 by a decision of the Court of King’s Bench against some encroachment on the right of the patentee. It was principally for the purpose of carrying on this manufactory with greater convenience, that the proprietors established an iron-foundry of their own at Smethwick, in the neighbourhood of Soho.

In 1785 Boulton was made a fellow of the Royal Society, about the same time with Withering, and several others of his scientific neighbours. In 1788 he turned his attention to the subject of coining, and erected machinery for the purpose, so extensive and complete, that the operation was performed with equal economy and precision, and the coins could not be imitated by any single artist for their nominal value,—each of the stamps coining, with the attendance of a little boy only, about eighty pieces in a minute. The preparatory operation of laminating and cutting out the metal was performed in an adjoining room; and all personal communication between the workmen was rendered unnecessary by the mechanical conveyance of the work from one part of the machinery to another. A coinage of silver was executed at this mint for the Sierra Leone Company, and another of copper for the East Indiee, besides the pence and half-pence at one time in circulation throughout England, and a large quantity of money of all kinds for Russia. In acknowledgment of Boulton’s services, and in return for some specimens of his different manufactures, the Emperor Paul made him a present of a valuable collection of medals and minerals.

In 1797 he obtained a patent for a mode of raising water by impulse, the specification of which is published in the ninth volume of the Repertory of Arts, p. 145. It had been demonstrated by Daniel Bernouilli, in the beginning of the century, that water flowing through a pipe, and arriving at a part in which the pipe is suddenly contracted, would have its velocity at first very greatly increased; but no practical application of the principle appears to have been attempted, until an apparatus was set up in 1792 by Mr Whitehurst for Mr Egerton of Oult∩n, in Cheshire, consisting of an air-vessel communicating with a water-pipe by a valve, which was forced open by the pressure or rather impulse of the water, when its passage through the pipe was suddenly stopped by turning the cock in the ordinary course of domestic economy; and although the pipe through which the water was forced up was of moderate height, the air-vessel, which was at first made of lead, was soon burst by the “momentous force,” as Whitehurst termed it. The apparatus had excited much attention in France, under the name of Montgolfier’s hydraulic ram; and Boulton added to it a number of ingenious modifications, some of which, however, are more calculated to display the vivid imagination of a projector than the sound judgment of a practical engineer, which had in general so strongly characterized all his productions.

He died, August 17,1809, after a long illness, in possession of considerable affluence and of universal esteem. (See Smiles’s Lives of Boulton and Watt, 1865.)
