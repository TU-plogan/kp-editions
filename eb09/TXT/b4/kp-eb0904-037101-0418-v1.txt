BROOKS, Charles Shirley, an English novelist, and dramatic and miscellaneous writer, was born in 1815. He was the son of an eminent London architect, and received his education at a public school in the city. Applying himself to the study of law, he passed the usual examination for admission; but instead of pursuing further the professional path, he turned aside and began to feeFhis way towards the broader field of literature. He wrote, sometimes alone, sometimes in conjunction with others, slight dramatic pieces of the burlesque kind, and became a newspaper reporter. In this capacity he was for many years engaged on the Morning Chronicle. For the same paper he afterwards undertook to write the parliamentary summary, and was appointed special commissioner to carry out investigations on the subject of labour and the poor. For this purpose he travelled in Southern Russia, Egypt, and Syria; the results of his inquiries appearing first in the form of letters to the editor, and afterwards in a separate volume, under the title of The Russians of the South (1856). Brooks was for many years on the staff of the Illustrated London News, contributing the weekly article on the politics of the day, and the two series entitled “Nothing in the Papers” and “By the Way,” besides other occasional pieces. In 1854 he joined the staff of [9:4:372] Punch, aud noteworthy among his numerous contributions were the weekly satirical summaries of the parliamentary debates, entitled “The Essence of Parliament.” His long service as newspaper reporter gave him special aptitude for this playful parody. In 1870, on the death of Mark Lemon, “dear old Shirley,” as his friends used to call him, was chosen to succeed to the editorial chair. He added to his reputation by several good novels, the first of which, -dspβ7⅛ Court, was published in 1855. It was followed by The, Gordian Knot (1860), The Silver Cord (1861), and Sooner or Later (1868). Brooks was a great letterwriter, deliberately cultivating the practice as an art, and imitating the style in vogue before newspapers and telegraphs suppressed private letters. He had an astonishing memory, was brilliant as an epigrammatist, and was a great reader, and a most genial and admirable companion. Though he nearly reached his sixtieth year, he retained all the charm of youthful freshness and brightness. He was in his element with a group of children, reading to them, sharing their fun, and always remembering the birthdays. He died in London, February 23, 1874. His remains were interred, near those of his friends Leech and Thackeray, in Kensal Green cemetery. As a novelist Shirley Brooks holds a high rank, but not the highest. His novels probably suffered in some respects from the manner of their production, the slow piece-meal writing for periodical literature. But they possess qualities of an order which will save them from the swift oblivion that overtakes so many books of their class. He shows in them a large knowledge of men, especially of Londoners, a fair acquaintance with the world of books and the world of art, a fertile imagination, and much critical acumen. And these qualities are set off to the best advantage by the charm of an admirably vigorous and polished style. In this respect, and in the force of his refined satire, he bears some likeness to his greater friend, the author of Vanity Fair.
