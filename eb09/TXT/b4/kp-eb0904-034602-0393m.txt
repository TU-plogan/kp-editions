BRIL, Paul, a Flemish painter, born at Antwerp in 1554. The success of his elder brother Matthew in the Vatican induced him to repair to Rome. On the death of Matthew, Paul, who far surpassed him as an artist, succeeded to his pensions and employments. He painted landscapes with a depth of chiaroscuro then little practised in Italy, and introduced into them figures well drawn and finely-coloured. Many of his pictures are extant in Italy. One of his best compositions is the martyrdom of St Clement, in the Sala Clementina of the Vatican. He died at Rome in 1G26. (See Lanzi, History of Painting.)
