BREDOW, Gabriel Gottfried, a German historian and professor in the university of Breslau, was born at Berlin in 1773. He is known in England by his Manual of Ancient History, which was translated into English in 1827; Researches on History, Geography, and Chronology; and his valuable Historical Tables, which come down to 1811. This last work was translated into English by Major J. Bell, who continued the tables down to 1820, and produced a popular and very useful work. Bredow died in 1814.
