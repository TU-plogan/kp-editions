BORNE, Ludwig, German political writer and satirist, of Jewish family, was born 18th May 1786, at Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where his father, Jakob Baruch, carried on the business of a banker. He studied first at Berlin, where he became acquainted with Schleiermacher and the famous Henrietta Herz, and afterwards at Halle, intending to enter the medical profession. His inclinations for pure literature proved too powerful to allow him to carry out this design, and in 1806 he removed to Heidelberg in order to study financial and political economy. Two years later he took his degree at Giessen, and in 1811 he received an appointment in the bureau of police in his native town. The reconstitution of Frankfurt as a free city after the fall of Napoleon’s power in -Germany soon deprived him of a situation which was but little suited to his tastes or abilities. He then devoted himself to literature, and for a time edited a newspaper entitled Staats-Ristretto, which was quickly suppressed by the Government on account of its liberal tone and the boldness of its criticisms. The same fate attended his next venture, Die Zeitschwingen, which appeared for only four months. In 1817 he renounced hi3 Jewish faith and took the name of Börne, by which he is always known. From 1818 to 1821 he edited Die Wage, a paper particularly distinguished by its lively political articles, and by its powerful but sarcastic theatrical criticisms. For some years after the suppression of his paper, Börne resided principally in Paris, Hamburg, and Frankfurt. After the July revolution (1830) he hurried to Paris, expecting to find the newly constituted state of society somewhat in accordance with his own philosophic views; but in this hope he was completely disappointed, and the bitterness of his anger lent additional force to the satirical letters he began to publish in his last literary venture, La Balance. While advocating his favourite scheme of a closer union between France and Germany, he assailed with unsparing sarcasm and polished wit the German dynasties, whom he looked upon as the great opponents of liberalism. He died at Paris in 1837. Börne’s works are remarkable for brilliancy of style and for a thoroughly French vein of satire. His most elevated piece of criticism is the Denkrede auf Jean Paul, in which he shows himself fully able to appreciate the great German humourist. The Menzel der Tranzosenfresser may be taken as a specimen of his unrivalled powers of sarcasm. There have been several complete editions of his writings, the latest being that of 1862, 12 vols., Leipsic; his life has been written by Gutzkow, 1840.
