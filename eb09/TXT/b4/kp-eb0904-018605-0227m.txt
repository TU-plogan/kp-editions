BRABANT, an extensive district in the Netherlands, which formerly constituted a separate duchy, but is now divided between Belgium and Holland. The Belgian portion includes the provinces of Brabant and Antwerp, while the whole of the Dutch portion is still known by its ancient name. Godfrey the Bearded, count of Louvain, who lived in the beginning of the 12th century, was the first to assume the title of count of Brabant, which his great-grandson, Henry I. the Warrior (1190-1235) exchanged for that of duke. The duchy passed in regular succession to Henry II. the Magnanimous (1235-1248), and Henry III. the Debonnair (d. 1261); but on the death of the latter the natural heir was supplanted by his younger brother John I. the Victorious, who added the district of Limburg to his possessions by the battle of Woeringen in 1288, in which he killed his competitor Henry of Luxembourg with his own hand. The next duke, John II., is memorable for the privileges he bestowed on his subjects by the statute of the Common Weal and the charter of Cortemberg. His successor, John III. the Triumphant, had to contend against a rebellion of Brussels and Louvain, and an offensive alliance of his neighbours, but managed to make himself not only secure but formidable. His three sons having died before him without issue, he was succeeded by his daughter, who had married Wenceslas of Luxembourg. The count of Flanders laid claim to the duchy, and, after a considerable struggle, was only bought off by the surrender of Antwerp. In 1404 the whole of Brabant was handed over to the countess of Flanders, and in 1406 her son took the title of duke. On his death at the battle of Agincourt, in which he fought on the side of the French, he was succeeded by John IV., whose marriage and divorce created much excitement in his day. In 1430, on the decease of Philip, second son of John IV., the duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, was also recognized as duke of Brabant; and in 1440 the country passed to the house of Austria by the marriage of Mary of Burgundy his granddaughter to Maximilian the emperor, who transmitted it to Charles V. and thus to the crown of Spain. In 1648 the northern portion of the duchy succeeded in freeing itself from the Spanish tyranny, while southern Brabant continued under the yoke till 1714. Brabant possessed a liberal constitution known as the Joyeuse Entrée, Blyde Inkomst, or Joyous Entrance, which, inter alia, prevented the duke from raising the clergy above the other states of the realm, from prosecuting his subjects except in the regular courts, and from appointing foreigners to political office. A consent of the three states—the clergy, the nobles, and the representatives of the chief cities—was necessary for the passing of a law; and the towns had the right of refusing assistance [9:4:187] in any military expedition with the object of which they had not been previously made acquainted. The states usually met every two years, and a permanent committee of tho three orders held its session in Brussels. The Brabantine court, under the native dynasty, was famous for the encouragement which it afforded to learning and literature; and more than one of the dukes have left proof of personal culture in the shape of songs. (See Dinaux, Trouvères Brabançons, IIainuyers, <fcc., 1863.)

Brabant, North, the modern Dutch province, has an area of 231 square miles, and in 1870 the population was 4,832,612. The surface is flat and the soil alluvial. The principal rivers are the Maas, the Aa, and the Dommel. The capital is ’s Hertogenbosch, a city of 24,395 inhabitants, and the other chief towns are Breda (14,721), Bergen-op-Zoom (8352), Helmond (5301), and Tilburg (5262).

Brabant, South, the modern Belgian province, has an area of 1262 square miles, and in 1870 the population was 879,814. Its general features are much the same as those of the Dutch province, though the surface is rather more varied in its elevation. The principal rivers are the Senne, the Dyle, and the Demer. The capital is Brussels with 177,954 inhabitants; and the other cities of importance are Louvain (32,976), Tirlemont (12,354), Nivelles (8800), Diest (7561), and Vilvorde (6844).
