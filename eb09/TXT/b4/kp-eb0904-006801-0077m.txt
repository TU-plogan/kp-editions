BOSNA SERAI, Seraievo, or in Italian Seraglio, a city of European Turkey, and capital of the province of Bosnia, is situated on the Migliazza near its junction with the Bosna, 246 miles south of Buda in 43° 54' N. lat. and 18° 24' E. long. It occupies the declivities of several small hills, and its numerous turrets give it a rather imposing aspect. It is defended by a strong citadel, and retains portions of its ancient walls. The houses are in general rather meagre, but of late there has been an improvement in the style of architecture, owing to the employment of Austrian and Italian workmen. The old Government buildings have been replaced by a handsome and spacious structure. There are upwards of 100 mosques, several Greek churches, and a few Roman Catholic convents. Educational establishments owe any merit they possess to foreign influence, and notably to the stimulus given by Miss Irby and Miss Mackenzie (afterwards Lady Sebright). Bosna Serai is one of the chief industrial and commercial cities in European Turkey. It manufactures tin, iron, and copper wares, fire-arms, cotton and woollen cloths, and leather, and is the centre of the Bosnian trade. In the neighbourhood are iron mines, and works of considerable extent. The city is the centre of a telegraphic system of some importance, and is well situated for railway communication with both north and south. Bosna Serai, originally called Bosnavar, was founded in 1263 by the Hungarian general Cotroman, and derives its present name from the Serai or palace bujlt by Mahomet II. The population is very variously stated; the Prussian consul gives it as about 50,000 in 1865, and in 1867 as not more than 35,000, while Salaheddin Bey, in La Turquie à l'exposition universale de 1867, states it as high as 70,000.
