BYRON, Hon. John (1723-1786), admiral and circumnavigator, second son of the fourth Lord Byron, and grandfather of the poet, was born November 8, 1723. While still very young accompanied Anson in his voyage of discovery round the world. During many successive years he saw a great deal of hard service, and so constantly had he to contend, on his various expeditions, with adverse gales and dangerous storms, that he was aptly nicknamed by the sailors “Foul-weather Jack.” It is to this that Lord Byron alludes in his famous Epistle to Augusta :—

“A strange doom is thy father’s son’s, and past Recalling as it lies beyond redress,

Reversed for him our grandsire’s fate of yore, He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore.

In 1769 he was appointed governor of Newfoundland. In 1775 he attained his flag rank, and in the following year became a vice-admiral. In 1778 he was despatched with a fleet to watch the movements of the Count d’Estaing, and in July 1779 fought an indecisive engagement with him off Grenada. He soon after returned to England, retiring into private life, and died April 10, 1786.
