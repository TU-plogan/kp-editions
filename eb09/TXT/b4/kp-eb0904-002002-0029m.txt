BOLTON, or Boltonle Moors, a municipal and parliamentary borough of England, in the county of Lancashire, 11 miles N.W. of Manchester, in 53° 35' N. lat. and 2° 37' W. long. It is divided by the Croal, a small tributary of the Jewell, into Great and Little Bolton, the former of which is situated on the south side of the stream. The town is on the whole well arranged and well built, and great improvements and extensions have been effected since 1860. An abundant supply of water is obtained from the neighbouring hills and stored in reservoirs at Belmont, Sharpies, and Heaton. The waterworks, formerly in the hands of a company founded in 1824, have been the property of the corporation since 1847. The water rises by natural pressure to a height of 80 feet. Bolton possesses a large number of churches, but few are remarkable for either antiquity or architecture. The parish church of St Peter’s, a building of somewhat early date, was restored in an elaborate style about 1868. Among the educational establishments may be mentioned Lever’s Grammar School, founded in 1641, where Dr Ainsworth, the Latin lexicographer, and Lemprière, of the Classical Dictionary, were formerly masters. A new town-hall, two clothhalls, a fish-market, an exchange, a theatre, and assembly rooms, are among the chief buildings. There are several public libraries and a mechani<s ’ institute; and in 1855 a large Church of England institute was erected. During the great cotton famine the unemployed operatives were set to work on a large public park, which was opened in 1866. The cotton manufacture m various departments is still the most important in the town; in 1871 it gave employment to 8708 men and 11,353 women of twenty years of age and upwards. Various other industries, however, are extensively carried on. In 1871, 1030 adult workmen were employed in the manufacture of machinery, and 2524 in the iron manufacture; while silk-weaving was the occupation of 881, linen-weaving of 289, and paper-making of 306. Bleaching is also extensively carried on, and there are chemical works, dye-works, and calico-printing establishments. The coal mines in the neighbourhood give employment to nearly 4000 miners. Bolton is a place of some antiquity, but had little importance till the introduction of the woollen manufacture by Flemish immigrants about 1337. Several centuries afterwards its industries received a further development from a body of French refugees, driven from their own country by the Edict of Nantes. During the civil war of the 17th century the inhabitants espoused the popular side, and their town was taken by storm in 1644 by the royalists under Prince Rupert and the earl of Derby. The 18th century saw a great stimulus given not only to Bolton but to all England by the inventions of Arkwright and Crompton, who were both natives of the parish. It was here that cotton velvets were made for the first time (in 1756) and muslins (1782) by means of machinery. In 1791 a canal was constructed from Manchester to Bolton, and in the following year an Act of Parliament was passed for enclosing Bolton Moor. This measure was soon succeeded by a large extension of the town, which has since continued to increase from year to year. The municipal borough, with an area of 1748 acres, contained in 1851 10,394 inhabited houses for a population of 61,171; and in 1861, 13,129 houses for a population of 70,395. In 1871 the borough, with an increased area of 1822 acres, included 16,286 houses, and the population was 82,853. The parliamentary borough, which owes its existence to the Reform Bill of 1832, returns two members to parliament.
