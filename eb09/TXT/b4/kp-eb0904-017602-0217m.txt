BOURGELAT, Claude, who may be called the father of veterinary science, was born at Lyons in 1712, and died in 1799. He entered the profession of law, but abandoned it in disgust at having gained an unjust suit for a client. Embracing the military profession he served in the cavalry, and thus had ample opportunity of studying the diseases of animals. In 1772 he opened at Lyons a veterinary school, which soon became celebrated over Europe. His great success induced the Government to establish several similar institutions; and Bourgelat was appointed to superintend the school established at Alfort, which became, and continues to be, the chief seat of veterinary science in France. Bourgelat was a member of the Academies of Sciences of Paris and of Berlin, and corresponded with some of the most eminent men of science of his time. His works on veterinary subjects »re numerous and valuable; perhaps the most important is the Traité de la conformation extérieure du cheval, de sa beauté et de ses défautes, 1776.
