BROUWER, Adrian, a Dutch painter, was born at Haarlem in 1608, of very humble parents, who bound him apprentice to the painter Frank Hals. Brouwer had an admirable eye for colour, and much spirit in design; and these gifts his master appears to have turned to his own profit, while his pupil was half starved. As the result of this ungenerous treatment, Brouwer was frequently brought into low company and dissipated scenes, which he delineated with great spirit and vivid colouring in his pictures. The unfortunate artist died in a hospital at Antwerp in 1640, at the early age of thirty-two, consequently his works are few and rarely met with. The largest collection of his masterpieces is in the picture gallery at Munich.
