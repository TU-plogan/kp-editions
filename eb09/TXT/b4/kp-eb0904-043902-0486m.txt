BUDWEIS (in Bohemian, Ceske Budegovice) the capital of a circle in the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, is situated on the right bank of the Moldau, at its junction with the Maltsch, in 48° 59' N. lat. and 14° 30' E. long. It is well built and partially fortified. Chief among its public buildings are the council house—a handsome structure, and the cathedral, with a great detached tower, built in 1500; it has also an episcopal palace, two gymnasiums, a theological seminary, a training college, a deaf and dumb institution, a theatre, a hospital, and a poorhouse; and a short distance to the north stands the castle of Frauenburg, belonging to Prince Schwarzenberg. Its manufactures are very various, and comprise pottery, nails, wire, parquetry, musical instruments, black-lead pencils, sugar, beer, vinegar, and liqueurs. There are silver and gold mines in the mountains to the east of the town, which are still worked with considerable profit. The railway from Budweis to Linz, laid in 1827 for horse-cars, was the first line constructed in Germany. Budweis was founded by Ottocar II. in 1256, and was received into the number of privileged cities by Frederick II. In 1611 the town was captured by the·people of Passau, but was retaken by the imperial general Bouquoi. In 1742, it was besieged by the Bavarians. Population in 1869, 17,413.
