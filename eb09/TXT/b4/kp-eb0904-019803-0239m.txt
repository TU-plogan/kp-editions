BRADSHAW, Henry, an English poet, born at Chester about the middle of the 15 th century. Early displaying a taste for religion and literature, he was received while a boy into the Benedictine monastery of St Werberg in that city; and he was afterwards sent to Gloucester (now Worcester) College, Oxford. After studying there for a time with the novices of his order he returned to his convent, where, in the latter part of his life, he applied himself chiefly to the study of history. He died in 1513. His poetry in some respects is not inferior to that of any of his contemporaries. His works are,â€”(1), De antiquitate et magnificentia Urbis Cestrioe; (2), Chronicon; (3), The Life of the Glorious Virgin St Werberg, printed at London, 1521, 4to, in verse, and now extremely rare. The life of St Werberg forms only part of this work, which contains also a description of the kingdom of Mercia, a life of St Etheldred, a life of St Sexburg, the foundation and history of Chester, and the chronicles of some kings.
