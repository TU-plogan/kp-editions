BOURG, the chief town of the department of Ain in France, and formerly the capital of the province of Bresse, is situated 27 miles N.E. of Lyons, on the banks of the Reyssouze, a tributary of the Saône. Its streets are narrow and crooked, and the whole town is very irregularly laid out. Among its public buildings are a new prefecture, a tneatre, a library (with upwards of 22,000 volumes), an asylum, a foundling hospital, a lyceum, and a theological seminary. In the suburb of St Nicholas is the famous church of Nôtre Dame de Brou, which was built in the first half of the 6th century by Margaret of Austria, and is remarkable [9:4:176] for the richness of its sculpture and carving. Two of the squares of the town are ornamented, one with a statue of Bichat by David d’Angers, and the other by an obelisk to the memory of General Joubert. The manufactures of the place consist of cloth, linen, hats, hosiery, horn combs, and pottery; and there is an active trade in grain, cattle, horses, and wine. The early history of Bourg and its identification with any of the places recorded by the Roman writers have been matters of considerable dispute. In the earlier part of the Middle Ages it seems to have been called Tanuni. Raised to the rank of a free town in the end of the 13th century, it was afterwards chosen by Amadeus IV. of Savoy as the chief city of the province. In 1535 it passed to France, but was restored to Duke Philibert Emanuel, who in 1590 built a strong citadel, which afterwards withstood a six months’ siege by the soldiers of Henry IV. The town was finally ceded to France in 1G01. In 1814 the inhabitants, in spite of the defenceless condition of their town, offered resistance to the Austrians, who put the place to pillage. Vaugelas the grammarian and Lalande the astronomer were both born at Bourg-en-Bresse. Population in 1872, 12,912.
