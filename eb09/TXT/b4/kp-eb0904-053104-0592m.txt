BURDER, George, one of the founders of the London Missionary Society, was born in London, June 5, 1752, [9:4:532] and died there May 29, 1832. He was pastor of the Independent church at Lancaster from 1778 to 1783. Afterwards, he was for twenty years minister of the West Orchard chapel at Coventry. At the end of this period he removed to London, where for twenty-nine years he officiated at the Fetter Lane chapel. For many years he performed gratuitously the duties of secretary to the London Missionary Society, and edited, with much success, the Evangelical Magazine. He is chiefly remembered now as the author of the Village Sermons, which appeared at intervals from 1799 to 1812, and were at last completed in six volumes. They have had an extraordinarily wide circulation, and have passed through numerous editions. He edited many works,—among others the Pilgrim's Progress, Collings’s Weaver's Pocket-book, or Weaving Spiritualized, and Henry’s Bible with Improvements.
