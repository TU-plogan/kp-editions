BURNEY, Charles, Doctor of Music (1726-1814), was born in the ancient city of Shrewsbury, the capital of Shropshire, on the 7th of April 1726. He received his earlier education at the excellent free school of that city, and was afterwards sent to the public school at Chester. His first music master was Mr Baker, organist of Chester Cathedral, and a pupil of Dr John Blow. Returning to Shrewsbury when about fifteen years old, he continued his musical studies for three years under his half-brother, Mr James Burney, organist of St Mary’s Church, and was then sent to London as a pupil of the celebrated Dr Arne, with whom he remained three years. In 1749 he was appointed organist of a church in the city, with a salary of £30 a year; and he was also engaged as conductor of a concert established at the King’s Arms, Cornhill. In that year and the next he composed the music of three dramas for Drury Lane theatre— Alfred, Robin Hood, and Queen Mab. Being threatened with a pulmonary affection he went, on the advice of his physician, in 1751 to Lynn, in Norfolk, where he was elected organist, with an annual salary of £100, and where he resided for the next nine years. During that time he began to entertain the idea of writing a general history of music. In 1760 he returned to London in good health, and with a young family; the eldest of whom, a girl of eight years of age, surprised the public by her attainments as a harpsichord player. In 1766 he produced, at Drury lane, a free English version and adaptation of J. J. Rousseau’s operetta Le Devin du Village, under the title of The Cunning Man, which was favourably received. The university of Oxford conferred [9:4:565] upon him, on 23d June 1769, the degrees of bachelor and doctor of music, on which occasion he presided at the performance of his exercise for these degrees. This consisted of an anthem, with an overture, solos, recitatives, and choruses, accompanied by instruments, besides a vocal anthem in eight parts, which was not performed. His friend, C. P. E. Bach, requested a copy of this exercise, and had it performed in St Catharine’s Church at Hamburg, under his own direction, in 1773. It was repeatedly performed at Oxford, “after it had fufilled its original destination,” as Burney tells us (Hist. of Music, vol. iii. p. 329); and he apologizes as follows for saying so much about it :—“It is hoped that the reader will pardon this egotism, which has been extorted from me by occasional and sinister assertions, ‘that I neither liked nor had studied church music.’” (Ibid). In 1769 he published An Essay towards a History of Comets. Amidst his various professional avocations, Burney never lost sight of his favourite object,—his History of Music,— and therefore resolved to travel abroad for the purpose of collecting materials that could not be found in Great Britain. Accordingly, he left London in June 1770, furnished with numerous letters of introduction, and proceeded to Paris, and thence to Geneva, Turin, and the principal cities of Italy. The results of his observations he published in The Present State of Music in France and Italy (1 vol. 8vo, London, 1771). Dr Johnson thought so well of this work, that, alluding to his own Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland, he said, “I had that clever dog Burney’s Musical Tour in my eye.” In July 1772 Burney again visited the Continent, to collect further materials, and, after his return to London, published his tour under the title of The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands, and United Provinces (2 vols. 8vo, London, 1773). In 1773 he was chosen a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1776 appeared the first volume (in 4to) of his long-projected History of Music; in 1782 the second volume; and in 1789 the third and fourth. Though severely criticised by Forkel in Germany and by the Spanish ex-Jesuit, Requeno, who, in his Italian work Saggj sul Ristabilimento dell' Arte Armonica de' Greci e Romani Cantori, Parma, 1798 (2 vols. 8vo), attacks Burney’s account of the ancient Greek music, and calls him lo scompigliato Burney, the History of Music was generally recognized as possessing great merit. The least satisfactory volume is the fourth, the treatment of Handel and Bach being quite inadequate. Burney’s first Tour was translated into German by Ebeling, and printed at Hamburg in 1772; and his second Tour, translated into German by Bode, was published at Hamburg in 1773. A Dutch translation of his second Tour, with notes by J. W. Lustig, organist at Groningen, was published there in 1786 The Dissertation on the Music of the Ancients, in the first volume of Burney’s History, was translated into German by J. J. Eschenburg, and printed at Leipsic, 1781. Burney derived much aid from the first two volumes of Padre Martini’s very learned Storia della Musica, Bologna, 1757-1770. One cannot but admire his persevering industry, and his sacrifices of time, money and personal comfort, in collecting and preparing materials for his History; and few will be disposed to condemn severely errors and oversights in a work of such extent and difficulty. In 1779 he wrote for the Royal Society an account of the infant Crotch, whose remarkable musical talent excited so much attention at that time In 1784 he published, with an Italian titlepage, the music annually performed in the Pope’s chapel at Rome during Passion Week. In 1785 he published, for the benefit of the Musical Fund, an account of the first commemoration of Handel in Westminster Abbey in the preceding year, with an excellent life of Handel. In 1796 he published Memoirs and Letters of Metastasio, 3 vols. 8vo. Towards the close of his life, Burney contributed to the Rev. Dr Rees’s Cyclopaedia all the musical articles not belonging to the department of Natural Philosophy and Mathematics. For these articles he received £1000, which seems a remarkable remuneration, considering that most of his materials were merely transcribed from his own History of Music. In 1789, through the treasury influence of his friend Edmund Burke, he was appointed organist to the chapel of Chelsea Hospital, and he resided in the hospital for the remainder of his life. He was made a member of the Institute of France, and nominated a correspondent in the class of the Fine Arts, in the year 1810. He died at Chelsea College on the 12th of April 1814, and was interred in the burying-ground of the college on the 20th of the same month.

Burney had a wide circle of acquaintance among the distinguished artists and literary men of his day. At one time he thought of writing a life of his friend Dr Samuel Johnson; but he retired before the crowd of biographers who rushed into that field. His character in private as well as public life appears to have been very amiable and exemplary. Dr Burney’s eldest son, James, was a distinguished officer in the royal navy, and died a rear-admiral in 1821. He published several works of merit. A notice of his second son, the Rev. Charles Burney, D.D., an eminent Greek scholar, will be found below, and of his second daughter Frances (Madame D’Arblay) under the heading D’Arblay. The Diary and Letters of Madame D’Arblay contain many minute and interesting particulars of her father’s public and private life, and of his friends and contemporaries. A life of her father, by Madame D’Arblay, appeared in 1832.

Besides the operatic music above mentioned, Burney’s known compositions consist of—1. Six Sonatas for the harpsichord; 2. Two Sonatas for the harp or piano, with accompaniments for violin and violoncello; 3. Sonatas for two violins and a bass: two sets; 4. Six Lessons for the harpsichord; 5. Six Duets for two German flutes; 6. Three Concertos for the harpsichord; 7. Six concert pieces with an in-trodτuΛιon and fugue for the organ; 8. Six Concertos for the violin, & c., in eight parts; 9. Two Sonatas for pianoforte, violin, and violoncello; 10. A Cantata, Ac.; 11. Anthems, Ac.; 12. XII. Canzonetti a due voci in Canone, poesia dell' Abate Metastasio.
