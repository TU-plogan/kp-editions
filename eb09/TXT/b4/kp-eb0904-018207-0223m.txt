+====================================================================+


BOYER, Alexis, a distinguished French surgeon, was born on the 1st of March 1757, at Uzerches in Limousin. His father was in the humble station of a tailor, and the son received the elements of a medical education in the shop of a barber-surgeon in a provincial town. His evident talent induced his friends to procure his removal to Paris, where he had the good fortune to attract the notice of his two distinguished masters, Louis and Dessault; and his unwearied perseverance, his anatomical skill, and finally his dexterity as an operator, became so conspicuous, that at the age of thirty-seven he obtained the appointment of second surgeon to the Hôtel Dieu of Faris, and was elected professor of operative surgery in the École de Santé. This latter appointment he soon exchanged for the chair of clinical surgery,—a department in which his manual dexterity and his admirable lectures on surgical subjects gained him the highest reputation, and introduced him to extensive practice. Perhaps no French surgeon of his time thought or wrote with greater clearness and good sense than Boyer; and while his natural modesty made him distrustful of innovation, and somewhat tenacious of established modes of treatment, he was as judicious in his diagnosis, as cool and skilful in manipulating, as he was cautious in forming his judgment on individual cases. In 1805 Napoleon nominated him imperial family surgeon, and, after the brilliant campaigns of 1806-7, conferred on him the legion of honour, with the title of Baron of the Empire, and a salary of 25,000 francs. On the fall of Napoleon the merits of Boyer secured him the favour of the succeeding sovereigns of France, and he was consultingsurgeon to Louis XVIII., Charles X., and Louis Philippe.

In 1835 he succeeded Deschan1p3 as surgeon-in-chief to the Hôpital de la Charité, and was chosen a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences of the Institute of France. From the period of his wife’s death, which he took much to heart, his health declined, and lie died November 23, 1833, at the age of seventy-six.

His two great works are— Traité complet de Γ anatomie, in 4 vols. 8vo, 1797-99, of which a fourth edition appeared in 1815, and Traité des maladies chirurgicales et des operations qui leur conviennent, 11 vols. 8vo, 1814-26. Of this work a new edition (the 5th), with additions by Μ. Ph. Boyer, in 7 vols., was published in 1844-53.
