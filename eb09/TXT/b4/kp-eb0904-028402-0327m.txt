BRIDGENORTH, a parliamentary and municipal borough and market town of England, in the county of Shropshire, on both sides of the Severn, 18 miles S.E. by E. of Shrewsbury. The river, which is here crossed by a handsome stone bridge of six arches, separates the upper from the lower town. The former is built on the acclivities and summit of a rock which rises abruptly from the river to the height of 180 feet, and gives the town a very picturesque appearance. The railway passes under by a long tunnel. On the summit is the tower of the old castle, leaning about 17 degrees from the perpendicular; two parish churches, one of which, St Leonard’s, was rebuilt in 1862; and a large public reservoir. There are in the town a mechanics’ institute, a public library—founded by the Rev. Mr Stackhouse, an infirmary, a jail, a theatre (1824), a market hall (1855), and a considerable number of schools and charities. It has manufactures of carpets, worsted, and tobacco-pipes, and some trade in agricultural produce. It returns one member to parliament. The population of the parliamentary borough amounted in 1871 to 7317; that of the municipal borough to 5876.

Bridgenorth, or Brigge, is said to have been founded by Ethelileda, the daughter of Alfred, and it was fortified with a castle and walls by Robert de Belesme, earl of Shrewsbury. On the earl’s rebellion the town was besieged and taken by Henry I. in 1102; and in the reign of Henry II. the castle was dismantled. In 1646 the town, being held by a Royal garrison, sustained a remarkable siege by the Parliamentary forces, who at last obtained possession.
