BORROWSTOUNNESS (usually abbreviated to Bo’ness), one of the oldest seaports of Scotland, is situated on the Firth of Forth, in Linlithgowshire, about four miles from the county town, in 56° 2' N. lat. and 3° 35' W. long. The town is very irregularly built, contrasting unfavourably with the beauty of its situation. It was formerly a place of considerable traffic, ranking in the 18th century immediately after Leith; but it has been for a long time left far behind by the neighbouring seaport of Grangemouth. Its harbour, with an area of 2⅜ acres, being too small for the trade of the port, a bill has been passed in Parliament for a large extension. The commerce is now for the most part confined to the Baltic, and the principal import consists of wooden props for use id mines. The value of the total imports in 1873 was £150,059, and of the total exports in the same year £223,539. There are extensive manufactories of salt, distilleries, a pottery, ropeworks, and vitriol and soap-works; but the collieries and iron-stone pits in the immediate neighbourhood are much more important. Some of the former have been worked for [9:4:66] centuries, and extend under the firth to the distance of a mile. The smelting of the iron-ore is carried on in two or three blast-furnaces in the neighbourhood of Kinniel House, which was for many years the residence of Dugald Stewart. A part of Graham’s Dyke, the Roman wall of Antoninus, runs through the parish. Population in 1871, 4256
