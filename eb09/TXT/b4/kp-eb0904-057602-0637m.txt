BUSIRIS, the name of a mythical king of Egypt not found either on the monuments or in the chronological lists, but mentioned by the later Greek writers and mythologists. By Apollodorus he was made the son of Aegyptus, and an Egyptian king, or else the son of Poseidon and Lyssianassa. After Egypt had been afflicted for nine years with famine Phrasius, a seer of Cyprus, arrived in Egypt and announced that the cessation of the famine would not take place until a foreigner was yearly sacrificed to Zeus or Jupiter. Busiris commenced by sacrificing the prophet, and continued the custom by offering a foreigner on the altar of the god. It is here that Busiris enters into the circle of the myths and parerga of Heracles, who had arrived in Egypt from Libya, and was seized and bound ready to be killed and offered at the altar of Zeus. Heracles burst the bonds which bound him, and, seizing his club, slew Busiris with his son Amphidamas, and his herald Chalbes. This exploit is often represented on vase paintings, the Egyptian monarch and his companions being represented as negroes. Although some of the Greek writers made Busiris an Egyptian king and a successor of Menes, about the sixtieth of the series, and the builder of Thebes, those better informed by the Egyptians rejected him altogether; they do not even admit that lie was the lieutenant of Osiris set over the lands opposite Phoenicia and the Mediterranean, nor do they recognize him as living two centuries after Perseus and later than Heracles. Various esoterical explanations were given of the myth, and the name not found as a king is recognized in that of one or more cities of the same name in Northern Egypt. The legend was unknown both to Homer and to Hesiod, and appears after the Greeks were more intimately acquainted with Egypt, and had seen the wall-paintings, or imperfectly understood the popular tales and traditions of the people, for there is no solid reason to believe that human sacrifices were ever offered in the country.
