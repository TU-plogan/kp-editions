BOSTON, Thomas, a popular and learned Scottish divine, born at Dunse, May 17, 1676. He was educated at Edinburgh, and in 1699 became minister of the parish of Simprin, from which he was translated in 1707 to Ettrick. It was by his recommendation that Hog of Carnock reprinted in 1718 the famous Marrow of Modern Divinity, which excited such a fierce controversy in the Scottish church. He also distinguished himself by being the only member of Assembly who entered a protest against the sentence passed on Professor Simson as being too slight a censure. He died May 20, 1732. His writings were numerous; but he is best known by his Fourfold State, the Crook in the Lot, and his Body of Divinity, works much esteemed by Presbyterians, and which long exercised a powerful influence over the minds of the Scottish peasantry. He left Memoirs cf his own Life and Times, published in 1776. An edition of his works in 12 volumes appeared in 1849,/;
