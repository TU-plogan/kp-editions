BUOY, a floating body used as a means of denoting any desired spot in a river, channel, or other place frequented by shipping. Buoys are made of various shapes and material, such as a small log of wood 6 or 8 inches diameter and about twice that length, an ordinary cask, or a special structure either of iron or wood, varying in strength, shape, and size according to the duty it is required to perform. Before an anchor is let go, a buoy is generally attached to it, the length of the buoy-rope being slightly greater than the depth of water at high tide. This is done that if for any reason it should become necessary to slip the cable, both anchor and cable may be afterwards recovered [9:4:531] the more readily, their position being denoted by the buoy, and also because it is of service to know the position of the anchor before attempting to weigh it. The buoys most commonly used for this purpose are of the shape of two cones brought together at their bases, and are made of sheet iron, usually galvanized; they are called Nun-buoys. Mooring-buoys are placed in convenient positions so that ships may make fast to them instead of dropping their anchors, and are generally provided with large ring and eye bolts for this purpose. Such buoys are usually of a cylindrical shape, and are made either of iron or wood. They must have sufficient buoyancy to support the weight of a cable of the required strength for the size of ship it is intended to moor, and at the same time be high enough out of the water to make themselves conspicuous. One of the largest and most approved mooring buoys recently made consisted of a cylinder 9 feet long and 6 feet 9 inches diameter, the edges of the ends being rounded off; it was made of iron plates -∣ inch thick, and was divided into two water-tight compartments by an iron flat passing through the axis of the cylinder; a watertight iron trunk was fitted, passing through the buoy at the centre, at right angles to the flat, for the cable to go through, so that it might be secured on the upper surface of the buoy.

Buoys are also used to mark the positions of sands and shoals. A usual shape given to them in rivers and sheltered places is that of a frustum of a cone, the smaller end being placed downwards, and the name of the buoy—a name which indicates the shoal it marks—being painted in large letters on the upper end. In more exposed positions the buoys have to be larger and stronger, and are usually made of an egg-shape flattened at the bottom. The largest and most approved are made of iron plates ⅜ inch and ⅜ inch thick, with a smaller buoy of similar shape, built within the larger one, so as to divide it into two watertight compartments. The advantage of the division in this case, and in the case of the mooring buoy described above, is, that the buoy is less liable to be sunk by collision with passing vessels, since if one compartment is damaged the other has sufficient buoyancy to float the whole. The largest of these buoys are about 15 feet 6 inches high, and 10 feet diameter at the widest part, the inner buoy being 9 feet high and 8 feet diameter.

A bell which is frequently placed on a buoy is of great service at night or in foggy weather, the motion of the buoy as it is tossed about by the waves causing the bell to ring.
