BULL, George (1634-1710), bishop of St David’s, was born at Wells, and educated at Tiverton school, Devonshire. He entered Exeter College, Oxford, but had to leave in consequence of his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the Commonwealth. He was ordained privately by Bishop Skinner in 1655. The first benefice he enjoyed was that of St George’s near Bristol, from which he rose successively to be rector of Suddington in Gloucestershire, prebendary of Gloucester, archdeacon of Llandaff, and in 1705 bishop of St David’s. He died February 17, 1710. During the time of the Commonwealth he adhered steadily, though with great prudence, to the forms of the Church of England, and in the reign of James II. preached very strenuously against the errors of Romanism. His works are among the most solid contributions made to theological learning by the Church of England. They uniformly display great erudition and powerful thinking. The Harmonia Apostolica, published in 1670, is an attempt to show the fundamental agreement between the doctrines of Paul and James with regard to justification. The Defensio Fidei Nicenoe, his greatest work, published in 1685, tries to show that the doctrine of the Trinity was an article of faith in the Christian church before the Council of Nicaea. It still retains value as a thoroughgoing examination of all the pertinent passages in early church literature. The Judicium Ecclesioe Catholicae obtained for him the thanks of the French clergy. His last treatise, Primitive and Apostolical Tradition, was published shortly before his death. The best edition of his works is that in 7 vols., published at Oxford by the Clarendon Press, under the superintendence of the Rev. E. Burton. This edition contains the Life by Nelson. The Harmonia, Defensio, and Judicium are translated in the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology.
