BORLASE, William, a learned antiquary and naturalist, was born at Pendeen in Cornwall, of an ancient family, February 2, 1696. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford, where he took his degree as master of arts. In 1720 he was ordained as priest; he was institutedin 1722 to the rectory of Ludgvan, andin 1732 was presented to the vicarage of St Just, his native parish. In the parish of Ludgvan are rich copper works, abounding with mineral and metallic fossils, of which he made a collection, and thus was led to study somewhat minutely the natural history of the county. In 1750 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society; and in 1753 he published, in folio, at Oxford, his Antiquities of Cornwall, a second edition of which was published at London, 1769, with the title of Antiquities, Historical and Monumental, of the County of Cornwall; consisting of several Essays on the Ancient Inhabitants, Druid Superstition, Customs, and Remains of the most remote Antiquity in Britain and the British Isles, exemplified and proved by Monuments now extant in Cornwall and the Scilly Islands; with a Vocabulary of the Comu-British Language. His next publication was Observations on the Ancient and Present State of the Islands of Scilly, and their importance to the trade of Great Britain, Oxford, 1756, 4to, which had previously been printed in the Phil. Trans. In 1758 appeared his Natural History of Cornwall, Oxford, folio. He presented to the Ashmolean Museum a variety of fossils and antiquities, which he had described in his works, and for his benefactions received the thanks of the university, and the degree of LL.D. He died August 31, 1772. Borlase was well acquainted with [9:4:55] most of the leading literary men of the time, more particularly with Pope, with whom he kept up a long correspondence, and for whose grotto at Twickenham he furnished the greater proportion of the fossils and minerals. His letters to Pope, St Aubyn, and others, with answers, fill several volumes of MS. There are also MS. notes on Cornwall, and a complete unpublished treatise Concerning the Creation and Deluge. Some account of these MSS., with extracts from them, will be found in the Quarterly Review, October, 1875. Borlase’s memoirs of his own life were published in Nichol’s Literary Anecdotes, vol. v.
