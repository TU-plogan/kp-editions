BUTLER, Alban (1710-1773), a hagiologist, was born in Northampton in 1710. After completing his education at the Roman Catholic college at Douay, he was appointed professor of philosophy, and afterwards professor of divinity. In 1745 he travelled through France and Italy in company with the earl of Shrewsbury and some other gentlemen. On his return he was sent as member of a mission to Staffordshire, but was soon afterwards appointed chaplain to the duke of Norfolk, whose nephew he educated and accompanied on a Continental tour. After returning to England he was made president of the English college at St Omerâ€™s, where he remained till his death in 1773. His great work, the Lives of the Saints, was first published in 5 vols. 4to, 1745, and has passed through many editions. It exhibits great industry and research, with considerable power of expression, and is in all respects the best work of its kind in English literature.
