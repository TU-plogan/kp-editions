BUHLE, Johann Gottlieb (1763-1821), distinguished as a scholar and an historian of philosophy, was born at Brunswick, and graduated at the university of Gottingen, where he obtained a chair at a very early age. Thence he was called to the professorship of ancient languages at Moscow. After his return to Brunswick he was appointed to the chair of natural law, which he held till his death in 1821. Buhleâ€™s activity was great, and the productions of his pen are numerous. He edited Aratus and part of Aristotle (the Bipontine edition, 5 vols.), the first volume of which is a masterly survey of Aristotelian literature. His fame, however, is principally derived from his labours on the history of philosophy. The Geschichte der philos. Vernunft, 1793, was suspended after the first volume, but the Handbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie, 8 vols. 1796-1804, is a very complete and valuable work. More important than either of these is the Geschichte der neuern Philosophie, forming one of the great series of histories of the sciences from the Renaissance. It is a work of much learning, and is well written; its faults are general weakness in critical appreciation and want of due sense of proportion. The History of Modern Philosophy has been translated into French, 6 vols. 1806.
