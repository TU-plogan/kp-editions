BONE, Henry, R.A., the most eminent enamel painter of his time in Great Britain, was born at Truro in 1755. He was much employed by London jewellers for small designs in enamel, before his merits as an artist were well known to the public. In 1800 the beauty of his pieces attracted the notice of the Royal Academy, of which he was then admitted as an associate; in 1811 he was made an academician. From the beginning of the century to 1831, he executed many beautiful pieces of much larger size than had been attempted before in England; among these his eighty-five portraits of the time of Queen Elizabeth, of different sizes, from 5 by 4 to 13 by 8 inches, are most admired. They were disposed of by public sale after his death, which took place in 1834. His Bacchus and Ariadne, after Titian, painted on a plate, brought the great price of 2200 guineas.
