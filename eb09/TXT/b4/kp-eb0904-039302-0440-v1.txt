BRUCE, Michael, a minor Scottish poet, was born at Kinnesswood, Kinross-shire, 27th March 1746, and was the son of a weaver. He was early sent to school, but his attendance was often interrupted. He had frequently to herd cattle on the hills in summer, and this early companionship with nature greatly influenced his mind and awoke the latent poetry of his genius. Delicate from birth he grew up contemplative, devotional, and humorous, the pet of his family and his friends. His parents gave him an education superior to their position; at fifteen, when his school education was completed, his father was enabled to send Michael to Edinburgh University, which he attended during the four winter sessions 1762-5. In 1765 he got employment as a teacher during the summer months at Gairney Bridge, receiving about £11 a year in fees. He became a divinity student of a dissenting Scotttish sect known as the Burghers, and in the first summer of his divinity course accepted the charge of a new school at Forrest Mill, where “he lead a melancholy kind of life.” Poverty, disease, and want of companions depressed his spirits, but in that solitariness he wrote “Lochleven,” a poem inspired by the memories of his childhood. In consequence of advanced consumption he had to give up the school, and returned to his father’s house, where he wrote his last and finest poem, “Elegy written in Spring,” and died on 5th July 1767. aged twenty-one years and three months. As a poet his reputation has been increased, first, through sympathy for his early death, and secondly, from the alleged theft by Logan of several of his poems. The Rev. John Logan, minister of Leith, a fellow-student of Bruce, edited in 1770 the Poems on several occasions, ^by Michael Bruce, in which the “Ode to the Cuckoo” appeared. In the preface he stated, “To make up a miscellany, some poems written by different authors are inserted.” In a collection of his own poems in 1781, Logan printed the “Ode to the Cuckoo” as his own; of this the friends of Bruce were aware, but did not challenge it. Dr M*Kelvie, in his Life and Works of Bruce (1837), was the first to claim for him the authorship of the Ode, and of other verses of which Logan had hitherto been the reputed author. This claim rests on the oral tradition of his birthplace and the evidence of a few of his friends; it was made nearly fifty years after Logan’s death, and no explanation can be given of this great lapse of time. Of direct testimony there is none, and irrelevant matter is brought in affecting Logan’s character, while Logan’s authorship rests on such ground as publication under his own name, and his reputation as author during his lifetime. By reiteration of Bruce’s claims in many forms popular opinion has been gained for him, though Isaac D’Israeli, Thomas Campbell, Robert Chambers, and David Laing have strenuously supported Logan. The dispute cannot now, perhaps, be satisfactorily settled, owing to tho conflict of evidence and lapse of time; but on the whole it may be doubted whether M ’ Kelvie has proved ⅛s case. All Bruce’s poems breathe the thoughts of a shepherd lad, as Bloomfield’s retained the fresh observations of a farmer’s boy. With two exceptions they are immature and lack strength]; his imagery is in great measure borrowed; his rhymes evince a paucity of poetical skill. His early attempts are weak imitations of Milton, Thomson, and Young, his [9:4:394] favourite poets. His “Lochleven” and “Elegy written in Spring” are alone worthy of preservation, and both were composed in his last year. The former abounds in happy word-painting and moral reflections. The tale of Levina, which forms about the half of the poem, and is by far the prettiest flower in the bouquet, bears distinct marks of the same hand that wrote “Runnimede.” The “Elegy” is most affecting, when read in the knowledge of the circumstance of its having been written by a dying youth of twenty-one :—

“Led by pale ghosts I enter death’s dark gate, And bid the realms of light and life adieu.”

It is a death song, remarkable for exquisite beauty and chaste simplicity. Bruce is not to be compared with another young Scottish poet, Robert Nicoll. His life wanted the fulness and strength, his poems the wide and vivid sympathies of his later compeer.
