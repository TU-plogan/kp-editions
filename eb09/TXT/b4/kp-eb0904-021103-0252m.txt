BRAINERD, David, one of the most zealous and successful of modern Christian missionaries, was born at Haddam, in the state of Connecticut, in 1718, and died October 9, 1747, in the house of his friend President Edwards. His heroic and self-denying labours among the American Indians wore out in the course of a few years a naturally feeble constitution, but left behind them important frqjts. The narrative of his mission is contained in his journal published in 1746. His life, compiled chiefly from his own diary, was written by President Edwards, and has gone through many editions. Brainerd was a man of strong mental powers, extensive knowledge, and great sagacity; and as a preacher he was forcible and pathetic.
