BOURNEMOUTH, a watering-place in the south of England, situated on the Hampshire coast about five milee from Christchurch. Its sheltered situation and desirable winter climate began to attract notice about 1840; and now it possesses five or six hotels, several churches, a library and reading-room, assembly-rooms, baths, and the usual accompaniments of a frequented watering-place. In 1855 a sanatorium for consumptive patients was erected by subscription, and various establishments of a similar nature have since been founded. A pier 800 feet long was opened in 1861, and in 1870 railway communication was afforded by a branch of the South-Western from Ringwood. The climate is remarkable for the equability of its temperature. According to observations from 1862 to 1872 the average maximum by day in July is 71 o, 9, and the average minimum by night in January 35° ∙6. The rainfall is about 30 inches in the course of the year, and the subsoil carries off water with great readiness. The surrounding country is extremely beautiful; and the buildings of Bournemouth itself are picturesquely disposed on the slope of a richly wooded hill. Population in 1871, 5906.
