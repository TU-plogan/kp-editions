BRÃœX, a city in the circle of Saatz, in the Austrian kingdom of Bohemia, on the River Bila. It consists of an old town, surrounded with walls, and three suburbs, and contains, besides the courts and public offices of the circle, nine churches, three monasteries, a gymnasium, barracks, a military college, and an educational establishment of Piarists. Its inhabitants are partly engaged in the coalmines, and in the preparation of salts from the Seidlitz waters in the vicinity. A battle was fought here in 1421 between the Hussites and Saxons; and in 1646 the Swedes captured the fort of Laudswert, now dismantled. Population in 1869 (including Taschenberg), 6102.
