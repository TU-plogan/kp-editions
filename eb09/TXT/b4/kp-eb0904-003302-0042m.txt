BONIFACE, the name of nine popes.

Boniface I., bishop of Rome from 418 to 422, was a contemporary of St Augustine, who dedicated to him some of his works.

Boniface II., 530-532, was by birth a Goth, and owed his election to the influence of the Gothic king. He had for some time an anti-pope, Dioscurus.

Boniface III., 15th February to 12th November 606, obtained from Phocas recognition of the headship of the Church at Rome.

Boniface IV., 608-615, received from Phocas the Pantheon at Rome, which was converted into a Christian church.

Boniface V., 619-625, did much for the Christianizing of England.

Boniface VI. was elected in April 897, and died fifteen days afterwards.

Boniface VII., who attained the Papal chair in 974, is sometimes styled an anti-pope. He is supposed to have put his predecessor, Benedict VI., to death. A popular tumult compelled him to flee to Constantinople; but he carried with him vast treasure, and in 984 he returned and removed, by murder, John XIV., who had been elected in his room. He died in 985 or 986.

Boniface VIII., Benedict Cajetan, a man of great ability, was elected in 1294, Celestine V. having been persuaded to resign. He meddled incessantly in foreign affairs, and put forward the strongest claims to temporal as well as spiritual supremacy. His bitterest quarrels were with the emperor, with the powerful family of the Colonnas, and with Philip the Fair of France, whom he excommunicated in 1303. He was about to lay all France under an interdict when he was seized at Agnani by a party of horsemen under Nogaret, an agent of Philip, and Sciarra Colonna. After three days’ captivity he was rescued by the town’s people, but the agitation he had undergone caused his death soon after, on the 11th October 1303. In 1300 Boniface instituted the jubilees, which afterwards became such a source of profit and of scandal to the church.

Boniface IX. was elected in 1390 and died in 1404. During his time the so-called Clement V. continued to hold state as pope in Aviguon.
