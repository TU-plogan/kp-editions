BUXTON, Jedediaπ, a prodigy of skill in numbers, was born in 1704, at Elιnton, near Chesterfield in Derbyshire. Although his father was schoolmaster of the parish, and his grandfather had been the vicar, his education had been so neglected that he could not write; aud his knowledge, except of numbers, was extremely limited. How he came first to know the relative proportions of numbers, and their progressive denominations, he did not remember; but on such matters his attention was so constantly rivetted, that he frequently took no cognizance of external objects, and when he did, it was only with reference to their numbers. He worked out every question after his own method, without any external aid, and without understanding the common rules of arithmetic. He would stride over a piece of land or a field, and tell the contents of it almost as exactly as if it had been measured by the chain. In this manner he measured the whole lordship of Elmton, consisting of some thousand acres, and gave the contents not only in acres, roods, and perches, but even in square inches. After this, for his own amusement, he reduced them into square hairs’-breadths, reckoning forty-eight to each side of the inch. His memory was so great, that in resolving a question he could leave off and resume the operation again at the same point after the lapse of a week, or even of several months. His perpetual application to figures prevented the smallest acquisition of any other knowledge. On his return from church it never appeared that he had brought away one sentence, his mind having been busied in his favourite occupation. His wonderful faculty was tested in 1754 by the Royal Society of London, who acknowledged their satisfaction by presenting him with a handsome gratuity. During his visit to the metropolis he was taken to see the tragedy of Richard III. performed at Drury Lane theatre, but his whole mind was given to the counting of the words uttered by Garrick. Similarly, he set himself to count the steps of the dancers; and he declared that the innumerable sounds produced by the musical instruments had perplexed him beyond measure. He lived till about the age of seventy, and died at the place of his birth.
