BURTSCHEID, or Bokcette, a town of Prussia, in the government of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen), and immediately to the S.E. of that city, with which it is connected by lines of houses. It occupies the slopes of a hill on the Wormfluss, and, like Aix-la-Chapelle, is famous for its mineral springs. One of these, known as the Mill-bath spring, is the hottest of Central Europe, having a temperature of 155° Fahr. The water is employed both externally and internally, and the establishments for its use are extensive and convenient. The town carries on the manufacture of woollen yarn and cloth, cast-iron goods, and machinery, and possesses an important trade. Burtscheid grew up round a Benedictine monastery, founded probably in the 10th century by Gregory, son of the Greek emperor Nicephorus Phocas, and brother-in-law of Otto II. of Germany, and is said to have taken its name of Poτcehιm from the number of wild swine in the neighbourhood. In the 13th century the Benedictiues became defunct, and a number of nuns from the convent of St Salvatorberg, near Aix-la-Chapelle, entered into possession. Their establishment continued till 1802, when it was broken up by the French. Population in 1872, 10,081.
