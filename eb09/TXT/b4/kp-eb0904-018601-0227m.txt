BOYSE, or Bois, John, one of the translators of the English Bible, was born in Suffolk in 1560. He was educated by his father, the rector of West Stowe, and at an early age exhibited great intellectual powers, being able to read Hebrew when only five years old. He completed his studies at Cambridge, particularly devoted himself to Creek, and for ten years was lecturer on that language in St Johnâ€™s College. At the age of thirty-six he married, and became rector of Boxworth, in Cambridgeshire. He was selected as one of the translators of the Bible, and is said to have completed not only his own share, the Apocrypha, but that of another clergyman. He received a prebendal stall in Ely cathedral from Bishop Andrews in 1615, but had no other preferment. He died in 1643, leaving behind him an immense mass of MSS.
