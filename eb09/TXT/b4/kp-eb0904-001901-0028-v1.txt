BOLOGNA, a province of northern Italy, having an area of 1385 square miles. It consists in the north of a fertile plain, well watered by several tributaries of the Po, while the southern portion is occupied by the Apennines, which separate it from Tuscany. It is in a highly flourishing condition. The soil produces abundant crops of rice, barley, wheat, and pulse, besides hemp, flax, olives, grapes, figs, almonds, chestnuts, and other fruits. The culture of silk is largely prosecuted; and considerable numbers of cattle and swine are reared in the province.

Bologna, the chief city of the above province and the see of an archbishop, is situated between the rivers Reno (Rhenus) and Savena, at the foot of the lower slopes of the Apennines, 399 feet above the level of the Adriatic, and 23 miles S.E. of Modena, on the main line of railway that runs across the north of Italy, in 44° 30' N. lat. and ll 0 2Γ E. long The city is about 2 miles in length and 1∣ in breadth, and is surrounded by a high brick wall with twelve gates. The streets are clean and well paved, but are generally narrow and crooked; the houses are mostly three stories high with projecting roofs, and are very often surrounded with arcades. All the public as well as private buildings are constructed of brick. The Piazza Vittorio Emmanuele, formerly called Piazza Maggiore or del Gigante, is the principal square and has many fine edifices. In the centre is a fountain adorned with a colossal statue of Neptune by Giovanni da Bologna. The city contains no fewer than 130 churches, twenty convents, and six hospitals. Of the churches the largest is San Petronio, an unfinished but splendid structure dating from 1390, and dedicated to the patron saint of the city. The cathedral or S. Pietro, begun in 1605, is surpassed not only by it but by S. Dominico, S. Giacomo Maggiore, and various others. San Stefano is a curious collection of seven churches, with a good deal of antiquarian interest. ( Vide Street’s Brick and Marble in the Middle Ages, 1874.) Of the secular buildings the most important are the Palazzo Pubblico, founded in 1290, the Palazzo del Podestà, of slightly earlier date, the Palazzo della Mercanzia, or Chamber of Commerce, and a few of the residences of the great mediaeval families. At the head of the educational institutions stands the university, which was once the most celebrated in Italy, but is now attended by only 400 or 500 students. The university library, which was at one time in the keeping of Cardinal Mezzofanti, numbers upwards of 140,000 volumes and 9000 MSS. The Accademia delle Belle Arte, situated in what was formerly the Jesuit’s College, has a rich gallery of paintings, chiefly by native artists. There is a museum of antiquities in connection with the university, as well as a botanical garden, and an observatory; and the city possesses besides a scientific institute, a philharmonic lyceum, and various intellectual institutions, many of which are due to the liberality of Count Ferdinand Marsigli, in the 17th century. There are five theatres (the Teatro del Commune, erected iu 1756 by Bibiena, on the site of the Palazzo Bentivoglio, being one of the largest in Italy), a casino, and a hall for playing the favourite game of ball. The leaning towers of Asinelli and Garisende are worthy of mention. They are situated quite near each other; the former, which is 272 feet in height, deviates 5 feet from the perpendicular, while the latter has a height of 138 feet and a divergence of 9. Bologna has long been famous for its Mortadelle sausages, its soap, and a kind of confection called terra catu; its manufactures also include crape, silk, glass, wax candles, paper, and musical instruments. The people have a very peculiar dialect. The city is the birthplace of Domenichino, Guido Reni, the Carraccis, Righini, Benedict XIV., and other famous men, and gave rise and name to the Bolognese school of painting. Population in 1871, 115,957.

Bologna is said to have been founded by an Etruscan king, and was originally called Felsina after his name. It was held for some time by the Boian Gauls, and on their expulsion became, in 189 B.c., a Roman colony under the name of Bononia. Its importance rapidly increased, but it does not appear much in history till the time of the civil wars. The terms of the second triumvirate were settled in 43 B.c. in an interview held between Octavius Antony and Lepidus on a neighbouring island. During the later empire the city was frequently an imperial residence, and in 410 A.D. it was still strong enough to resist the forces of Alaric. It afterwards passed under the p⅛wer of the Lombards, and on their subjugation by Charlemagne it was united to his empire and made a free imperial city. In 962 it became an independent republic, which soon acquired an extensive commerce and a powerful military force. The Middle Ages form the period of its greatest celebrity and importance. In the Crusades the Bolognese took an active share; and after a long neutrality in the contest between the Ghibellines and the Guelfs, they sided with the latter and became deeply involved in struggles both foreign and intestine. In 1240 they defended themselves successfully against Frederick IL, and in 1247 expelled from their city the Lampertazzi and Geremei with 1500 adherents. During the rest of the 13th century and the whole of the 14th and 15 th they passed from the domination of one powerful family to another—from the Pepoli to the Bentivogli, from the Bentivogli to the Visconti, and back again to the Bentivogli—till at last, in 1512, they were incorporated by Julius II. with the Papal States. The French Revolution made Bologna part of the Cisalpine Republic, but on the fall of Napoleon it reverted to the popes. In 1821 it was the centre of the republican insurrection, but had to yield in the following year before the Austrian arms. The revolution of 1831 was equally short-lived; and in 1849 the city was forced, after repeated bombardment, to receive an Austrian garrison, which continued in possession till the formation of the Italian kingdom in 1859.
