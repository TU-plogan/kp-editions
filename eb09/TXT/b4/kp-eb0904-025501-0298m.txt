BREISLAK, Scipione, an eminent geologist, was born at Rome in 1748. He early distinguished himself as professor of mathematical and mechanical philosophy in the college of Ragusa; but after residing there for several years he returned to his native city, where he soon became a professor in the Collegio Nazareno, and began to form the fine mineralogical cabinet in that institution. His leisure was dedicated to geological researches in the Papal States. His account of the aluminous district of Tolfa and adjacent hills, published in 1786, gained for him the notice of the king of Naples, who invited him to inspect the mines and similar works in that kingdom, and appointed him professor of mineralogy to the Royal Artillery. The vast works for the refining of sulphur in the volcanic district of Solfatara were erected under his direction. He afterwards made many journeys through the ancient Campania to illustrate its geology, and published in 1798 his Topografia Fisica della Campania, which contains the interesting results of much accurate observation. Breislak also published an essay on the physical condition of the seven hills of Rome, which he regarded as the remains of a local volcano,—an opinion which more recent investigations appear to disprove. The political convulsions of Italy in 1799 brought Breislak to Paris, where he remained until 1802, when, being appointed inspector of the saltpetre and powder manufactories near Milan he removed to that city. He died on the 18th of February 1826.

During the latter part of his career he published the following works:— Del Salnitro e dell' Arte del Salnitraio; Memoria sulla Fabbricazione e Raffi,nazionc de? Nitri ; Instruzione pratica per le piccole Fabbricazione di Nitro, da farsi dalle persone di Campagna. His valuable Introduzione alia Geologia appeared in 1811; a French edition with additions was published in 1819. Finally, the Austrian Government, in 1822, took on itself the expense of publishing his Descrizione Geologica della Provincia di Milano.
