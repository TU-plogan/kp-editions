BRAY, a seaport town and fashionable watering-place of Ireland, 12 miles S.S.E. of Dublin on the railway to Wexford. It is situated on both sides of the River Bray, which separates the two counties of Wicklow and Dublin, the portion in the latter county being known as Little Bray. The town is neatly built, and has a new parish church, a large Roman Catholic chapel, an old castle, a hospital, a court-house, several hotels, and Turkish baths. An esplanade runs along the shore for about a mile. The harbour admits small vessels only, and the trade is of little importance. There is a large brewery, which has been in existence for a considerable time. In the 12th century Bray was bestowed by Strongbow on Walter de Reddesford, who took the title of Baron of Bray, and built a castle in the town. It has since passed into the hands of various families. Its progress during the present century may be estimated by the gradual increase of the populationâ€”1841, 3185; 1851, 3156; 1861, 5363; 1871, 6077.
