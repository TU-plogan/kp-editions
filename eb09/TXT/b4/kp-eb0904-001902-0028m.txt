BOLOGNE, Jean (or Giovanni Bologna, as he was [9:4:20] styled in Italy), a celebrated sculptor, Î»vas born at Douay in 1524, and died at Florence in 1608. He went early to Italy, aud studied at Florence, where his best works still remain. His two most celebrated productions are the single bronze figure of Mercury, poised on one foot, resting on the head of a zephyr, as if in the act of springing into the air (in the Florentine gallery), and the famous marble group of the Rape of the Sabines, which received this name, Lanzi informs us, after it was finished. It is now in the Loggia de Lanzi of the ducal piazza. Giovanni was also employed at Genoa, where he executed various excellent works, chiefly in bronze. All his pieces are characterized by great spirit aud elegance.
