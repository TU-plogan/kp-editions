BRUNSWICK, a town of the United States of America, in Cumberland County, Maine, 27 miles N.N.E. of Portland, on the right bank of the Androscoggin River, which, with a fall of about 50 feet in half-a-mile, supplies a large amount of water-power. Numerous industrial establishments have been erected, the most important being a cotton factory, flour-mills, and bleach-works. The lumber-trade, which was formerly of great extent, has been in great measure replaced by the building and owning of ships. Besides possessing an excellent system of graduated schools, Brunswick is the seat of Bowdoin College, founded in 1802, and of the Maine Medical School, which dates from 1820. The river is crossed by two bridges, one of which unites the town with Topsham, and the other belongs to the Kennebec and Portland railway. Population in 1850, 4927; in 1870, 4687, or including the neighbouring village, 6136.
