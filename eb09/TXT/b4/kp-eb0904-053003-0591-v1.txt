BUONAFEDE, Appiano (1716-1793), an Italian writer on philosophy and social economy, was born at Comachio, in Ferrara, in 1716. He became professor of theology at Naples in 1740, and entering the religious body of the Celestines in 1734, rose gradually to be general of the order. He died at Rome in 1793. His principal works, generally published under the assumed title of Agatopisto Cromaziano, are on the history of philosophy, Della Istoria e delle Indole di ogni Filosofia, 7 vols., 1772, seq.; and Della Restaurazione di ogni FUosofia ne' Secol·i xvi., xvii., xviii., 3 vols., 1789 (which has been translated into German by Heydenreich). The second of these is of great importance for the estimation of the Italian philosophers of the 16th century. His other works are Istoria critica e filosofica del suicidio, 1761; Delie conquiste celebri esaminate col naturale diritto delle genti, 1763; Storia critica del moderno diritto di natura e delle genti, 1789; and a few poems and dramas.
