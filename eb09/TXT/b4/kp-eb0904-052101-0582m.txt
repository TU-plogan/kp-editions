BUNDI, a Râjput state of India, under the political superintendence of the Government of India through its agent in Râjputânâ, situated between 24° 58' and 25° 55' N. lat., and 75° 23' and 76° 36' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the native states of Jaipur and Tonk; on the E. by the state of Kotal; on the S. by Sindhiâ’s territories and on the W. by the state of Udaipur. Many parts o<, the state are wild and hilly, inhabited by a large Minâ population, a race of robbers. Two rivers, the Chambiâ and the Nij, water the state; the former is navigable by country boats. Area, 2291 square miles; population in 1871—72, 224,000, or 97 to the square mile. The chieftain and the greater part of his followers are Râjputs. Principal crops—Indian corn,jb<fr, wheat, pulses, and oil-seeds. Iron is found. The chief’s annual income amounts to £50,000, derived from land-tax levied both in kind and money, and from customs. Thefts and petty robberies are still of frequent occurrence. Our political relations with Bundi commenced in 1804 during the Marhattâ war, and in 1818 its chief accepted our protection. The present ruler has managed the state for the last fifty years, and done much to improve the condition of the people. Bundi pays an annual tribute of £4000 to the British Government.
