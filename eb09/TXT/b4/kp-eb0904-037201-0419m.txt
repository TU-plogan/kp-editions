+====================================================================+


BROOME, William, the coadjutor of Pope in translating the Odyssey, was born at Haslington in Cheshire, in 1689. He was educated upon the foundation at Eton, and was captain of the school a whole year, without any vacancy occurring by which he might have obtained a scholarship at King’s College. Being by this delay superannuated, he was sent to St John’s College by the contributions of his friends, and obtained a small exhibition there. His fondness for metrical composition was then such that his companions familiarly called him “Poet.” He appeared early in the world as a translator of the Iliad into prose, in conjunction with Ozell and Oldisworth, the translation being superior, in Toland’s opinion, to that of Pope. Broome was introduced to Pope, who was then visiting Sir John Cotton at Madingley, near Cambridge, and gained so much of his esteem that he was employed to make extracts from Eustathius for the notes to the translation of the Iliad, and in the volumes of poetry published by Lintot, commonly called Pope’s Miscellanies, many of his early pieces were insetted.

When the success of the Iliad gave encouragement to a version of the Odyssey, Pope, weary of the toil, called Fenton and Broome to his assistance; and taking only half the work upon himself, divided the other half between his partners, giving four books to Fenton and eight to Broome. To the lot of Broome fell the second, sixth, eighth, eleventh, twelfth, sixteenth, eighteenth, and twenty-third, together with the burden of writing all the notes. The price at which Pope purchased this assistance was £300 paid to Fenton and £500 to Broome, with as many copies as he wanted for his friends, which amounted to £100 more. The payment made to Fenton is known only by hearsay; Broome’s is very distinctly told by Pope in the notes to the Dunciad. It is evident that, according to Pope’s own estimate, Broome was unfairly treated. If four books could merit £300, eight, aud all the notes, equivalent at least to four more, had certainly a right to more than £600. Broome probably considered himself as injured, for he always spoke of Pope as too much a lover of money, and Pope pursued him with avowed hostility. He not only named Broome disrespectfully in the Dunciad, but quoted him more than once in the Bathos, as a proficient in the art of sinking. It has been said that they were afterwards reconciled, but their peace was probably without friendship. Broome afterwards published a Miscellany of Poems. He never rose to very high dignity in the church; he became rector of Sturston in Suffolk, where he married a wealthy widow; and afterwards, when the king visited Cambridge, in 1728, he was made doctor of laws. In the same year he was presented to the rectory of Pulham. Towards the close of his life he amused himself with translating some of the Odes of Anacreon, which he published in the Gentleman’s Magazine, under the name of Chester. He died at Bath in 1745.
