BROUSSONET, Pierre Marie Auguste, a distinguished French naturalist, was the son of a schoolmaster, and was born at Montpellier in 1761. He was educated for the medical profession, and at the age of eighteen was appointed to fill a professor’s chair. Botany seems to have been the science to which he was at first chiefly devoted; and he laboured with much zeal to establish the system of Linnaeus in France. With this view, as well as for his own improvement, he went to Paris, and visited the various museums and collections. He next came to England, and was admitted in 1782 an honorary member of the Royal Society. He published at London the first part of his work on fishes, Ichthyologioe Decas I. On his return to Paris he was appointed perpetual secretary to the’ Society of Agriculture, an office which the intendant Berthier de Sauvigny resigned in his favour. In 1789 he was nominated a member of the Electoral College of Paris, and for some time had the charge of superintending the supply of provisions for the capital. Under the Convention he had to leave Paris, and after some dangers he made his way to Madrid. The enmity of the French emigrants, however, drove him from Spain, and afterwards from Lisbon, where he had sought an asylum. At last he went out as physician to an embassy which the United States sent to the emperor of Marocco; and on this occasion his friend Sir Joseph Banks, informed of his distresses, remitted him £1000. After residing for some time at Marocco, he obtained from the French Directory permission to return to France, and was appointed by them consul at Teneriffe, where he resided for two years. On his return in 1797 he was chosen member of the Institute, and was reinstated in his botanical professorship at Montpellier, with the direction of the botanical garden. He was afterwards elected a member of the legislative body, but died of apoplexy on the 27th July 1807. France is indebted to him for the introduction of the Merino sheep and the Angora goat. None of his works are now of importance.
