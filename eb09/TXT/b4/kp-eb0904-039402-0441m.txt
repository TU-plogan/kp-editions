BRUCHSAL, a town of the Grand Duchy of Baden, in the circle of Carlsruhe, 14 miles from the city of that name, on the Salzbach. From 1056 to 1801 it was the seat of the bishop of Spires, whose magnificent palace is still extant; and it has an old castle of the 12th century (now used as a prison), a town-house, a gymnasium, a hospital, barracks, and a considerable trade in wine. Population in 1872, 9762. The town was originally the seat of an imperial palace, and its name is said to be derived from bruch a marsh, and sala, royal possession. The Peasantsâ€™ War first broke out at Bruchsal, which has been several times reduced to ashes in subsequent conflicts. In 1849 it was the scene of an engagement between the Prussian troops and Baden insurgents.
