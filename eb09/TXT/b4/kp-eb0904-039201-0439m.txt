BROWNISTS, a religious sect, which sprang up towards the close of the 16th century, and which received its name from the first promulgator of the doctrines, Robert Brown. Their numbers increased rapidly, and Sir Walter Raleigh, in a speech in 1592, estimated them at no less than twenty thousand. The harsh measures that were taken against them, and the disgust generally excited by the tone of their attacks upon the Established church, for a time stamped out the sect in England. But the remnant found a refuge in Holland, and the church established there between 1593 and 1608 included many eminent men, such as Ainsworth, Johnson, Smyth, Jacob, Clifton, and Robin son, and gradually increasd in numbers. Soon, however, differences of opinion began to arise; some, with Smyth, carried out the principles of Brownism to their full extent, and became absolute Separatists; others, with Robinson, adopted a milder form of opposition to the church, which ultimately resulted in Independency. The stronger stream of tendency set in towards this latter form of doctrine, and the Brownists soon faded out of view and gave place to the Independents. The occasion of the Brownists’ separation was not any fault they found with the faith, but only with the discipline and form of government of the other churches in England. They charged corruption equally on the Episcopal form and on that of the Fresbyterians by consistories, classes, and synods; nor would they join with any other Reformed church, because they were not assured of the sanctity and regeneration of the members who composed it, on account of the toleration of sinners, with whom they maintained it. an impiety to communicate. They condemned the solemn celebration of marriages in the church, maintaining that, as matrimony was a political contract, the confirmation of it ought to come from the civil magistrate. They would not administer baptism to the children of such as were not members of the church, or of such as did not take sufficient care of their children already baptized. They rejected all forms of prayer, and held that the Lord’s Prayer was not to be recited as a prayer, having been given only for a rule or model whereon all our prayers are to be formed. The form of church government which they established was democratical. When a church was to be gathered, such as desired to be members of it made a confession and signed a covenant, by which they obliged themselves to walk together in the order of the gospel. The whole power of admitting and excluding members, with the decision of all controversies, was lodged in the brotherhood. The church officers were chosen from among themselves, for preaching the word and taking caro of the poor, and were separated to their several offices by fasting, prayer, and imposition of hands by some of the brethren. But they did not erect the priesthood into a [9:4:393] distinet order. As the vote of the brotherhood made a man a minister, and gave him authority to preach the word and administer the sacraments among them, so the same power could discharge him from his office, and reduce him to the condition of a mere layman again. And as they maintained that the bounds of a church were defined by the number of those who could meet together in one place, and join in one communion, so the power of these officers was confined within the same limits. The minister or pastor of one church could not administer the Lord’s Supper to another, nor baptize the children of any but those of his own society. Any lay brother was allowed the liberty of prophesying, or of giving a word of exhortation to the people; and it was usual for some of them, after sermon, to ask questions, and reason upon the doctrines which had been preached. In a word, every church on the Brownists’ model is a body corporate, having full power to do everything which the good of the society requires, without being accountable to any presbytery, synod, assembly, convocation, or other jurisdiction whatever.
