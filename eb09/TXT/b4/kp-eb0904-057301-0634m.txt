BURY, a manufacturing town and parliamentary borough of England, in the county of Lancaster, on the Irwell, 8 miles N.N.W. of Manchester. The woollen-trade, introduced in the 14th century, and of such importance in the reign of Elizabeth that she appointed an officer to stamp the cloth, still gives employment to 1000 of the population, but it has been greatly surpassed in extent by the cotton manufacture, which with its various branches gave employment in 1872 to 16,256 men and women of the age of twenty years or upwards. The auxiliary and supplemental trades of engine-making, spindle-making, calico-printing, bleaching, and dyeing are also largely carried on; the paper manufacture employs about 600 people; upwards of 1000 miners find work in the neighbouring coal-pits; 1200 workmen are engaged in the iron manufacture, and nearly 200 in the stone quarries. The town has been not only greatly extended but also greatly improved since the middle of the century; it is well drained, and has a good supply of water. It contains a town-hall, an athen∞um (including a museum), a free grammar school, founded by the Rev. Roger Kay, a mechanics’ institute, and several public libraries. The parish church of St Mary’s was rebuilt in 1776. The government, which was at one time in the hands of three constables, appointed by the earl of Derby, the lord of the manor, was afterwards entrusted to a board of commissioners under a local Act; but the town has applied for municipal incorporation. Bury is a place of considerable antiquity, and w as formerly the seat of a baronial castle, which was destroyed by the Parliamentary forces in 1644. Sir Robert Peel was born at Chamber Hall in the neighbourhood, and his father did much for the prosperity of the town by the establishment of extensive printworks. A monument to the statesman now adorns the market-place. The parliamentary borough, which comprises the townships of Bury and Elton, has returned one member to Parliament since the Reform Bill of 1832. Its population in 1871 was 41,344, of whom 19,849 were males, and 21,495 females; the inhabited houses numbered 8279, and the registered electors 5518.
