BROWN, John, D.D., an English divine and author, was born at Rothbury, Northumberland, in November 1715. He was the son of John Brown, a descendant of the Browns of Coalstown near Haddington, who at the time of his son’s birth was curate of Rothbury. He was educated at St John’s, Cambridge; and after graduating as B.A. with great distinction, he returned to his father’s house at Wigton, received deacon’s and priest’s orders from Sir George Fleming, bishop of Carlisle, and in 1739 went to Cambridge to take his Μ. A. degree. In 1745 he distinguished himself as a volunteer, and was soon afterwards appointed one of his chaplains by Dr Osbaldeston, on his admission to the bishopric of Carlisle. It was probably during his residence at Carlisle that Brown wrote his poem entitled Honour, inscribed to Lord Lonsdale. His next poetical production was his Essay on Satire, addressed to Dr Warburton, to whom it was so acceptable, that he took Brown into his friendship. He also introduced him to Ralph Allen, of Prior Park, near Bath, to whom in 1751 Brown dedicated his Essay on the Characteristics of Lord Shaftesbury. In 1754 he was promoted by the earl of Hardwicke to the living of Great Horkesley in Essex, and in the following year he took the degree of doctor of divinity at Cambridge. In this year also he published his tragedy of Barbarossa, which, under the management of Garrick, was acted with considerable applause, though it was sharply censured when published. This tragedy was followed by a second, entitled Athelstane, which was represented at Drury Lane theatre. This was also well received by the public, but did not become so popular as Barbarossa. Among the most remarkable of his other productions are the Estimate of the Manners and Principles of the Times, a bitter satire; the Additional Dialogue of the Dead, which was a vindication of Chatham’s policy; and the Dissertation on the Rise, Union, and Power, <kc., of Poetry and Music. Dr Brown, who had an hereditary tendency to insanity, and from early life had been subject at times to fits of excessive melancholy, committted suicide on the 23rd of September 1766.
