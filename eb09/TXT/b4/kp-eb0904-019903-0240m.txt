BRAGA, a city of Portugal, capital of a district in the province of Minho, is situated on an elevated plain near the River Cavado (Noebiri), in 41° 43' N. lat. and 8° 16' W. long. The city proper, which has extensive suburbs, is surrounded by walls and towers, and has broad and well-built streets. The cathedral, which dates from the 12th century, is an imposing structure, and contains a large number of interesting objects of art. Among the other churches Santa Cruz is pre-eminent. There are also several convents in the city, an archiépiscopal palace, a lyceum, a library, an orphan asylum, and a large hospital; also the ruins of a theatre, a temple, and an aqueduct of Roman workmanship, and a great variety of minor antiquities of different ages. The principal manufactures are fire-arms, jewellery, and cutlery; and weaving and wax-bleaching are also carried on. A large cattle market is held in June and September. About two and a half miles distant is the celebrated sanctuary of Jesus de Monte, to which pilgrimages are frequently made. Population, 18,467.

Braga is identified with the Bracara Augusta of the Romans, the capital of the Callaici Bracarii. About the 5th century it became the chief city of the Suevi; it passed successively into the hands of the Goths and the Moors, and was captured from the latter by Alphonso of Castile. It has for a long time been the seat of the primate of Portugal, who also claimed to be head of the Spanish church, and before the conquest of Coimbra and Lisbon it was the residence of the Portuguese court.
