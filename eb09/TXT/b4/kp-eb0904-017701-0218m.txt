BOURNE, Vincent, one of the most able modern writers of Latin verse, was born at Westminster towards the close of the 17 th century. In 1710 he became a scholar at Westminster school, and in 1714 entered Trinity College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1717, and obtained a fellowship three years later. Of his after life exceedingly little is known. It is certain that he passed the greater portion of it as usher in Westminster school. He died on 2d December 1747. During his lifetime he published several small collections of his Latin poems, and in 1772 there appeared a very handsome 4to volume containing all Bourne’s pieces, but also some that did not belong to him. The Latin poems are remarkable not only for perfect mastery of all linguistic niceties, but for graceful expression and genuine poetic feeling. A number of them are translations of English poems, and it is not too much to say that the Latin versions almost invariably surpass the originals. Cowper, an old pupil of Bourne’s, Beattie, and Lamb have combined in praise of his wonderful power of Latin versification.
