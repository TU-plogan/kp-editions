BOYLE, Roger, earl of Orrery, fifth son of the Great Earl of Cork, was born in April 1G21, and was made Baron Broghill when only five years old. He distinguished himself while a student at Dublin College, and afterwards made the tour of France and Italy. Soon after his return he married Margaret Howard, sister to the earl of Suffolk; and passing over to Ireland with his bride he found the country in a state of rebellion, and assisted his father in opposing the insurgents. Upon the execution of the king, he retired to his seat at Marston in Somersetshire; but his spirit could ill brook this state of inactivity, and he therefore resolved to cross the seas, and apply to Charles II. for a commission to raise forces to restore the monarchy and recover his own estate. Under the pretence of visiting Spa for his health, he proceeded as far as London, where he received a message from Cromwell, then general of the parliamentary forces and a member of the committee of state, intimating his intention to wait upon him. During the interview Cromwell told him that the committee were apprised of his design; aud when Broghill assured him that the intelligence was false, Cromwell produced copies of several of his confidential letters, which reduced him to the necessity of asking Cromwell’s pardon, and requesting his advice in such a conjuncture. Cromwell told him, that though he had hitherto been a stranger to his person, he was not bo to his merit and character; that he had heard how gallantly he had behaved in the Irish wars; and he concluded by offering him a command as general officer, exempt from all oaths and engagements,—adding that he should not be obliged to draw his sword against any but the Irish rebels. Lord Broghill, greatly surprised at so unexpected an offer, requested some time for deliberation. But Cromwell brusquely told him that he must determine instantly, that he himself was about to return to the committee, who were still sitting, and that if he rejected their offer, they had determined to send him to the Tower. Broghill, finding that his liberty and life were in the utmost danger, pledged his honour that he would faithfully serve against the Irish rebels; and accordingly, by Cromwell’s instructions, he passed over into Ireland, where by many important services he fully justified the opinion which had been formed of him. A troop of horse which he had raised was soon increased to a regiment of 1500 men, and these he led into the field against the rebels. He was speedily joined by Cromwell, who placed the highest confidence in his new ally, and found him of the greatest value to the interests of the commonwealth.

When Cromwell became Protector, Lord Broghill was made one of his privy council, and admitted to great intimacy and confidence. He continued for some time to assist Richard Cromwell with his counsels, till, seeing that the weak nature of that amiable man would infallibly bring on his fall, he deemed it imprudent still to cling to one whom he could not save, and accordingly retired to his command in Ireland, where affairs shortly after took a turn extremely favourable to the design of the king’s restoration. Lord Broghill was not a little instrumental in bringing about that event; and, in consideration of his eminent services, Charles created him earl of Orrery, September 5, 1660. He was soon after made one of the lords justices of Ireland; and his conduct, whilst at the head of affairs in that kingdom, was such as to add greatly to the general esteem in which his character was previously held.

His active and toilsome course of life at length brought on disease and infirmity; but, notwithstanding, he went over to England in 1665, at the king’s desire, and mediated with success in a serious misunderstanding which existed between Charles and the duke of York.

On his return Lord Orrery, by his prudent and skilful measures, rendered abortive the scheme of a descent upon Ireland by the Dutch and French, planned by the duke de Beaufort, admiral of France.

About this time a quarrel with his old friend the duke of Ormond, arising from mutual jealousies, became so serious that the disputants resorted to England to defend their respective interests. This quarrel, though of a private beginning, became at last of a public nature. Lord Orrery was impeached, but defended himself so well that the prosecution failed. He lost, however, his public employments; but, retaining the king’s favour, he still came frequently· to court, and was often consulted on affairs of importance. His last voyage to England was for the purpose of obtaining medical advice; but his disease, which was gout, proved mortal, and he expired on the 16th of October 1679, in the fifty-ninth year of his age. Lord Orrery was the author of several works, chiefly dramas and poems now forgotten. Walpole remarks “that ho never made a bad figure, but as a poet.” As a soldier he was distinguished by his personal bravery and his skill in handling troops; as a statesman he was upright and manly; and his credit ever stood high for integrity, and for generous fidelity as a friend.
