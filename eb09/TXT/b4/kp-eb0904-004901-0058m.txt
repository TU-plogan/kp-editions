BOOTHIA FELIX, a peninsula of British North America, between lat. 69° and 72° N., and long. 92° and 97° W. It was discovered by Captain (afterwards Sir James) Ross, in 1830, and was named after Sir Felix Booth, who had fitted out the expedition. It forms the western side of the gulf of the same name into which Prince Regent’s Inlet leads from Baffin’s Bay. From the American shore it is almost separated by lakes and inlets; and a narrow channel known as Bellot Strait intervenes between it and North Somerset Island, which was discovered by Sir E. Parry in 1819. The peninsula is not only interesting for its connection with the Franklin expedition and the Franklin search, but is of scientific importance from the north magnetic pole having been first distinctly localized there by Ross.
