BORDEAUX, one of the finest and wealthiest commercial cities of France, formerly the capital of Guienne and Bordelais, and now the chief town of the department of Gironde. It is situated 370 miles S.E. of Paris, in 44° 50' N. lat. and 0° 25 ’ W. long., on the left bank of the Garonne, about 60 or 70 miles from its mouth, and in the midst of an extensive plain which comprises the district of Médoc, well-known for its red wines. Opposite the town the river makes a semicircular curve, and widens out into an extensive basin, which serves as a harbour, and is lined with quays on both sides for a distance of three miles. Vessels of 800 tons can come up to the town, and ships of the greatest ordinary tonnage have depth enough as far as Pauillac, about 35 miles from the mouth of the river. The basin is crossed by a magnificent stone bridge of 17 arches, 1534 feet long, which was built in 1821, and remained in the hands of a company till 1861 when it was declared free. A short distance further up the river is spanned by a railway bridge. Few cities in Europe can show such a striking water-front as Bordeaux; and though the streets of the older part are narrow and mean, those of the newer portions are wide and well paved, and contain handsome houses and public buildings. The principal square is the Place des Quinconces, which is adorned with statues of Montaigne and Montesquieu. Among the ecclesiastical buildings the most important are the cathedral of Saint André, a fine Gothic structure with two spires 160 feet high; the church of Saint Michel, founded in 1160, and formerly remarkable for a spire 319 feet in height, destroyed by a storm in 1768; Saint Croix, probably in existence before the 7th century, restored in 1864-5; Saint Paul, built by the Jesuits in 1676; and the church of the Collège Royal, in which is the tomb of Montaigne. The great intellectual activity of the city may be seen from the fact that it possesses an academy (with faculties of theology, law, science, and literature), a medico-pharmaceutical school, a lyceum, a school for deaf-mutes, a normal school, and a school of navigation; numbers among its societies an academy of sciences, arts, and belles lettres, a medical society (founded in 1798), an agricultural society, a philomathic, a Linnaean, a horticultural, and an archaeological society; and maintains nine daily papers, about as many weeklies, and two or three monthly periodicals, besides the official publications of several of the above-mentioned societies. Its communal library, which dates from 1566, contains about 200,000 volumes; and it has also an antiquarian museum, a museum of natural history, and a picture gallery. Among its benevolent institutions are the hospital of Saint André, founded in 1825 to replace an older building of the same name, which dated from 1390, a children’s hospital, originated in 1619, a hospital for incurables, a maternity and a military hospital, the lock hospital of Saint Jean, and a magnificent deaf and dumb asylum. Of theatres there are five,—the Grand Théâtre, finished in 1780 and seated for 1300; the Théâtre Louit, opened in 1868, for 2500; the Théâtre Français, dating from 1857, for 1300; the Théâtre National, opened in 1866, for 1000; and the Théâtre des Folies Bordelaises built in 1872. A few buildings are of merely antiquarian interest, the most important being the Palais Gallien, which is really an old Roman amphitheatre of the 3d century, and the tower of Pey Berland. Bordeaux is the seat of an archbishop, and has a court of appeal, a court of assize, and tribunals of primary instance and commerce. It has also a mint, the coinage of which is marked by the letter K. Its commercial institutions are necessarily numerous and varied; comprising an exchange, banks, insurance-offices, custom [9:4:52] houses, public warehouses, and consulships of some forty different countries. The trade is very extensive, particularly in wines, and has undergone a remarkable development since the introduction of railways and steamships. For a long time Bordeaux was greatly indebted to the Languedoc canal, but this means of communication is now of minor importance. The toial value of the export and import trade is annually about £16,500,000, about a third belonging to Britain. In 1872 the value of Bordeaux wines exported from France was upwards of £5,600,000, and the brandy and liqueurs from Bordeaux itself annually produce about £1,000,000. The other articles exported comprise corn, fruits, sugar, wood, resin, rags, madder, tartar, gums, indigo, and native manufactures. Shipbuilding is a leading industry, the number of firms in that department being about twenty in 1875. In the same year 220 vessels belonged to the port, with a total tonnage of upwards of 92,000 English tons.

Bordeaux, or Burdigala, was originally the chief town of the Bituriges Vivisci. Under the Roman empire it became a flourishing commercial city, and in the 3d century it was made the capital of Aquitania Secunda. Ausonius, a writer of the 4th century, who was a native of the place, describes it as four-square and surrounded with walls and lofty towers, and celebrates its importance as one of the greatest educational centres of Gaul. In the evils that resulted from the disintegration of the empire Bordeaux had its full share, and did not recover its prosperity till the beginning of the 10th century. Along with Guienne it belonged to the English kings for nearly three hundred years (1154-1452), and was for a time the seat of the brilliant court of the Black Prince, whose son Richard was born in the city. An extensive commerce was gradually developed between the Bordeaux merchants and their fellowsubjects in England,—London, Hull, Exeter, Dartmouth, Bristol, and Chester being the principal ports with which they traded. For full details regarding the character of the traffic and its influence on the destinies of the city the reader may consult Francisque Michel’s Histoire du Commerce et de la Navigation de Bordeaux, 1867. In 1548 the inhabitants resisted the imposition of the salt-tax by force of arms, a pardonable rebellion for which they were punished by Montmorency with merciless severity. At a later period they held out for the Frondeurs against the royal army under Louis XIV. and Richelieu, with an obstinacy that brought the monarch and his minister to a humbler mood. During the Reign of Terror the city suffered almost as severely as Lyons and Marseilles, and its commerce was greatly reduced under Napoleon I. In 1814 it declared for the House of Bourbon; and Louis XVIII. afterwards gave the title of duke of Bordeaux to his grandnephew, better known as the Count de [9:4:53] Chambord. In 1870 the French Government was transferred to Bordeaux from Tours on the approach of the Germans to the latter city.
