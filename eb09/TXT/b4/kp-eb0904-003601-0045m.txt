BONNE VAL, Claude Alexandre, Comte de, a celebrated French adventurer, known also as Achιnet Pasha, was the descendant of au old family of Limousin. He was born on the 14th July 1675 at Coussac, and at the age of thirteen joined the Royal Marine Corps. After three years he entered the Guards, whence he was transferred to the infantry regiment of Latour He served in the Italian campaigns under Catinat, Villeroi, and Vendome, and in the Netherlands under Luxembourg, giving proofs of iudomitable courage and great military ability. His insolent bearing towards Chamillard, minister of war, was made matter for a court-martial. He was condemned to death, but haviug foreseen this sentence, he saved himself by flight to Germany. Through the influence of Prince Eugene he obtained a command in the Austrian army, and fought with great bravery and distinction against France, and afterwards against Turkey. He was severely wounded at Peterwardein, and after his recovery paid a visit to Paris. The proceedings against him in France had been allowed to drop, and he married a daughter of Marshal de Biron, whom, however, he deserted after a week or two. He returned again to the Austrian army, and fought with distinction at Belgrade. He might now have risen to the highest rank, had he not made himself disagreeable to Prince Eugene, who sent him as master of the ordnance to the Low Countries There his ungovernable temper led him into a quarrel with the Marquis de Prié, governor of the Netherlands, who answered his challenge by placing him in confinement. A court-martial was again held upon him, and he was condemned to death; but the emperor commuted the sentence to one year’s imprisonment and banishment from the imperial domains. Bonueval, soon after his release, offered his services to the Turkish Government, professed the Mahometan faith, and took the name of Achmet. He was made a pasha of three tails, and appointed to the command of the artillery. He rendered valuable sevices to the sultan in his war with Russia, and with the famous Kouli Khan. As a reward he received the governorship of Chios, but soon fell under the suspicion of the Porte, and was banished for a time to the shores of the Black Sea. He was meditating a return to Europe and Christianity when he died at Constantinople, 27th March 1747. The Memoirs published under his name are spurious.
