BRIDGET, St, one of the patron saints of Ireland, who lived during the 6th century, was a daughter of one of the princes of Ulster, and took the monastic vow at a very early age. Her cell, the first in Ireland, was erected under a large oak tree, whence the place was called Kil-dara, the cell of the oak. The city of Kildare is supposed to derive its name from St Bridgetâ€™s cell. A whole collection of miraculous stories have clustered round her name, and her reputation was not confined to Ireland, for St Bride was a favourite saint in England and in Scotland.
