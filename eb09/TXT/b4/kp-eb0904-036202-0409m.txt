BROMSGROVE, a market-town of England, in the county of Worcester, 13 miles S. by W. of Birmingham, with a station on the Birmingham and Worcester Railway, at the distance of a mile and a half. The church of St John is a fine old building, restored in 1858, with a tower and spire 189 feet in height. The free grammar school, founded by Edward VL, has been recently enlarged; and a literary institute and a school of art have been established. The principal manufactures of the town are nails, buttons, needles, and coarse linen stuffs; and there are also waggonworks and malt-kilns. The population of the Improvement District in 1871 was 6967.
