BUDGELL, Eustace (1685-1736), a literary man of some eminence in lιis time, the son of Dr Gilbert Budgell, was born at St Thomas, near Exeter. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford, from which he removed to the Inner Temple, London; but instead of studying law, he devoted his whole attention to literature. He was befriended by Addison, who was first cousin to his mother, and who, on being appointed secretary to Lord Wharton, lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1710, took Budgell with him as one of the clerks of his office. Budgell, who had read the classics and the best English, French, and Italian authors, took part with Steele and Addison in writing the Toiler. He was also a contributor to the Spectator and the Guardian,— his papers being marked with an X in the former, and with an asterisk in the latter. He was subsequently made under-secretary to Addison, chief secretary to the lords justices of Ireland, and deputy-clerk of the council, and was afterwards chosen a member of the Irish parliament. In 1717, when Addison became principal secretary of state in England, he procured for Budgell the place of accountant and comptroller-general of the revenue in Ireland. But the next year, the duke of Bolton being appointed lord-lieutenant, Budgell wrote a lampoon against Mr Webster, his secretary, in which the duke himself was not spared. This led to his removed from his post of accountant-general, upon which he returned to England, and, contrary to the advice of Addison, published his case in a pamphlet. In the year 1720 he lost <£20,000 by the South Sea scheme, and afterwards spent £5000 more in unsuccessful attempts to get into parliament. This completed his ruin. He at length employed himself in writing pamphlets against the ministry, and published many papers in the Craftsman. In 1733 he began a weekly periodical called the Bee, which he continued for above a hundred numbers. By the will of Dr Matthew Tindal, who died in 1733, a legacy of 2000 guineas was left to Budgell; but the bequest (which had, it was alleged, been inserted in the will by Budgell himself) was successfully disputed by [9:4:439] TindaΓs nephew and nearest heir, the continuator of Rapin’s History of England. Hence the satirist—

“Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on my quill, And write whate’er he please—except my wfll.”

It was thought that he had some hand in publishing Dr Tindal’s Christianity as Old as the Creation; for he often talked of an additional volume on the subject, but never published it. After the cessation of the Bee, he became so involved in lawsuits that he was reduced to very distressing straits. He then studied law, and was called to the bar, attending the courts for some time; but being unable to make any progress, and finding his prospects utterly ruined, he determined to put an end to his life. Accordingly, in 1736, he took a boat at Somerset-stairs, after filling his pockets with stones, ordered the waterman to shoot the bridge, and while the boat was passing under it threw himself into the river. On his desk was found a slip of paper with the words—“What Cato did, and Addison approved, cannot be wrong.”

Besides the works mentioned above, he wrote a translation of the Characters of Theophrastus He never married, but left one natural daughter, who afterwards assumed his name, and became an actress at Drury Lane.
