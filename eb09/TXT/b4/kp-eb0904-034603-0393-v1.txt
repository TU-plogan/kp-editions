BRINDISI, a fortified city and seaport of Italy, in the province of Otranto, is situated at the head of a bay of the Adriatic in 40° 39' 27" N. lat. and 17° 28' 44" E. long. The streets are for the most part narrow and crooked, and the town in general is in a somewhat ruinous condition. Since the restoration of its maritime importance, which is mainly due to the fact that it forms the great transit station in the overland route to Asia by the Mont Cenis Railway and the Suez Canal, some improvement has taken place, and it bids fair to become one of the most flourishing cities in the country. The progress, however, has hitherto been comparatively slow, and the only extensive addition which has been effected is a new street leading from the railway station to the harbour. A cathedral in rather a dilapidated state, a citadel with huge round towers (founded by Frederick II. and completed by Charles V.), and a seminary (containing a library bequeathed to the town by archbishop Leo), are the only public buildings worthy of notice. The ruins of the circular church of St Giovanni, which was destroyed by earthquake, are not without interest; an ancient building of uncertain date is popularly regarded as the house where Virgil died; and there is a remarkable column supposed by some to have marked the termination of the Appian Way, but more probably belonging to an ancient temple. There are ten public schools in the town. The trade was represented in 1873 by imports to the value of £344,000, and exports to £325,000. The former consist mainly of raw silk, wheat and flour, coals, manufactured cottons, and petroleum; and the latter of manufactured coral, corn, dried fruits, and olive oil. The number of vessels that arrived at the port in 1873 was 709, of which 422 were steamships. The harbour consists of an outer and an inner portion, and the inner is divided into two basins, extending right and left. The outer port is about 6400 feet long by 3200 wide, the western arm of the inner portion 4800 by 800, and the eastern arm 3520 by 640. An extensive system of dredging has been in operation since 1866, and long lines of quays are being gradually constructed. Graving-docks are also in course of construction; and a lagoon, called Fiume Piccolo, close to the outer harbour, which has been a constant source of malaria, is being filled up. The population of the town, which was only 8000 in 1861, had increased to 13,755 in 1871.

Brindisi, Brundisium, or ^Bρtvτeσιov, was originally, it would appear, a city of the Sallentines, from whom it was captured by the Romans in 267 B.c. Colonized by its conquerors in 244. B.c., it soon rose into importance, and became their chief naval station in the Adriatic. Hannibal vainly attempted to surprise the city, which remained faithful to Rome through the darkest days of the Punic straggle. During the war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the former endeavoured to shut up his rival’s fleet in the inner harbour, by closing the entrance with wooden piles, which are frequently but erroneously supposed to have been the cause of the destraction of that part of the port. On the fall of the Western Empire Brundisium seems to have been outstripped by the neighbouring city of Hydruntum (Otranto). In the 10th century it was destroyed by the Saracens, but was rebuilt by Spathalupus the Byzantine governor, whose name still stands graven on the marble column above mentioned. After passing through various vicissitudes in common with the rest of Southern Italy, it fell into the hands of the Normans, and in the 11th century it was the scene of the chivalrous pageantry of Tancred’s court. It was plundered in 1348 by Louis, king of Hungary, and in 1458 suffered severely from an earthquake. Some time before this last disaster a more serious injury had been inflicted by Prince Giovanni Antonio Orsini, who completely choked the entrance to the inner port by sinking a number of vessels laden with stone. The commercial importance of the city rapidly declined, and it was of no interest save to the classical scholar as the birthplace of Pacuvius, and from its association with the mirthful journey of Horace and the death of Virgil.
