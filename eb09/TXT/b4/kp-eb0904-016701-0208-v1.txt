BÖTTIGER, Karl August, a distinguished German archaeologist, was born at Reichenbach in 1760. He was educated at the famous school of Pforta, and at the University of Leipsic. In 1784, after having passed a few years as private tutor in Dresden, he was made rector of the school at Guben, where he remained for six years. He was then transferred to a similar post at Bautzen, and in 1791, through the influence of Herder, obtained the appointment of rector of the gymnasium at Weimar. In that town he entered into a circle ' of literary men of the highest powers, including Wieland, Schiller, and Goethe, and distinguished himself by the great versatility of his talents. He published in 1803 a lively and learned work, Sabina, oder Morgenscenen einer reichen Römerin, giving a description of a wealthy Roman lady’s toilette, and a work on ancient art, Griechische Vasengemälde. At the same time he assisted in editing the Journal des Luxus und der Mode, the Deutsche Mercur, and the London and Paris. In 1804 he was called to Dresden as superintendent of the studies of the court pages, and received the rank of privy councillor. In 1814 he was made director of studies at the court academy, and inspector of the Museum of Antiquities. He died at Dresden in 1835.

Of his numerous works, most of which are devoted to ancient art, the following seem most worthy of notice :— Ideen zur Archäologie der Malerei, 1811; Kunstmythologie , 1811; Vorlesungen und Aufsätze zur Altherthumskunde, 1817; Amalthea, 3 vols., 1821-25; Ideen zur Kunstmythologie, 2 vols., 1826-36. The Opuscula et Carmina Latina were published separately in 1837, with a collection of his smaller pieces, Kleine Schriften, 3 vols., 1837-8. A sketch of his biography has been written by his son, Karl Wilhelm Böttiger (1790-1862), for some time professor of history at Erlangen, who is well known as the author of several valuable histories {History of Germany, History of Saxony, History of Bavaria, Universal History in biographies.)
