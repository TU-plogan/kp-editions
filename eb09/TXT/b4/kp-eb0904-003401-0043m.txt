BONNER, or Boner, Edmund, an English prelate, notorious for his persecutions of the Protestants during the reign of Queen Mary, was born at Hanley in Worcestershire, about the end of the 15th century, and generally passed for the natural son of George Savage, a∙ priest who was the natural son of Sir John Savage of Clifton in tho same county. Strype in his Memorials of Cranmer, however, says he was positively assured that Bonner was the legitimate offspring of a poor man, who lived in a cottage long afterwards known as Boner’s place. About 1512 he entered as a student of Broadgate Hall (now Pembroke College), Oxford; and in 1519 he was admitted as bachelor of the canon and of the civil law. Having been admitted into orders, he obtained some preferment in the diocese of Worcester. In 1525 he took his degree as doctor, and attracted the notice and patronage of Wolsey. Bonner was with the cardinal at Cawood when he was arrested on charge of high treason. After the death of Wolsey he adopted Lutheran sentiments, and insinuated himself into the favour of Henry VIII., who made him one of his chaplains, and employed him in several embassies abroad. In 1532 he was sent to Rome with Sir Edward Carne, to answer for the king, who had been cited to appear in person or by proxy in regard to the divorce of Queen Catharine. In 1533, being again despatched to Pope Clement VII., then at Marseilles, to intimate Henry’s appeal to a future general council from the sentence pronounced against his divorce, he threatened the Pope with so much resolution, that his holiness talked of having him burned alive or thrown into a cauldron of melted lead. Clement did not foresee that the man whom he had thus menaced with the flames was destined to burn heretics in England in support of the very faith which, under Henry, he had lent his aid to overthrow. In 1538, being then ambassador at the court of France, he was nominated bishop of Hereford; but before consecration, he was translated to the see of London, and was enthroned in April 1540. When Henry VIII. died in 1547, Bonner was ambassador at the court of the Emperor Charles V. During Henry’s reign he was constantly zealous in his opposition to the Pope, and favoured the Reformation in obedience to the king, who exacted rigid compliance with all his caprices. On the accession of Edward, however, Bonner refused to take the oath of supremacy, and was committed to the Fleet, where he remained until he promised obedience to the laws. After his release he assented to the Reformation, but with such manifest reluctance, that he was twice reprimanded by the Privy Council, and in 1549 was, after a long trial, committed to the Marshalsea, and deprived of his bishopric, to which, however, he was restored on the accession of Mary; and soon afterwards he was appointed, in place of Cranmer, vicegerent and president of the Convocation. From this time he became the chief instrument of persecution, and is said to have condemned no less than 200 Protestants to the flames in the space of three years. On the accession of Elizabeth he appeared with the rest of the bishops at Highgate, to congratulate her; but the queen refused to permit him to kiss her hand. Having, in the second year of her reign, refused to take the oath of supremacy, he was again committed to the Marshalsea, where he died, September 5, 1569, after a confinement of ten years. The character of Bonner was remarkable for obstinacy and inflexibility in everything save principle; yet even in this respect it exhibits some striking contrasts. In his early career he accommodated his principles to his convenience and ambition; after his return to Catholicism, he remained steadfast to the church, and, when disgraced, bore his deprivation and imprisonment with apparent resignation. The charge of atheism brought against one so defiled with blood was superfluous. He was constitutionally merciless and austere, fitted by nature for a persecutor, and equally capable of employing the same ardent zeal either against or in favour of any cause that he espoused. Among his works oxe, Responsum et Exhortatio in LaudemSacerdotii, [9:4:35] a préfaça in Gardeuer’s treatise De Vera Obedιentia, and several homilies.
