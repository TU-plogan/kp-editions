BRASIDAS, one of the most famous of the Spartan leaders in the early part of the Peloponnesian War, first distinguished himself by the relief of Methone, which was besieged by the Athenians (431 b.c. ) For this service he was publicly commended at Sparta. In 429 he was sent to assist Cnemus, and appears to have taken part in the unsuccessful attack on the Piraeeus. Two years later he accompanied the admiral Aleidas to Corcyra, but did not succeed in inducing his superior to make an attack on the city. He was severely wounded in the assault on Pylos (425), and lost his shield, which was picked up and carried in their triumph by the Athenians. When it was resolved by Sparta to carry the war into Thrace, Brasidas was selected as leader. He relieved Megara in 424, and in the same year succeeded in passing through Thessaly and in effecting a junction with Perdiccas of Macedon. He assisted Perdiccas to put down a revolted vassal, Arrliibaeus, and then, in an extremely short time, partly by his skilful policy, partly by the rapidity and boldness of his movements, succeeded in gaining possession of Acanthus, Stagira, Amphipolis, and Torone. In the spring of 423 a truce was agreed upon; but Brasidas insisted upon retaining Scione, which had capitulated a day or two after the truce began; this was denied, however, by the Spartan general. The revolt of Mende gave him another opportunity, and he seized that town. Later in the same year he again accompanied Perdiccas against Arrhibaeus, and made a most skilful retreat. He received no reinforcements from Sparta, where the leaders seemed jealous of his success, his conciliatory manners, and his dexterous policy. The Athenians, on the other hand, sent out a new armament, retook Mende, and repelled an assault on Potidaea. In 422 Cleon with the fresh Athenian troops besieged Amphipolis. A swift sally, directed by the skilful generalship of the Spartan leader, was crowned with success. The Athenians were routed, and Cleon slain, but Brasidas himself was mortally wounded. He was interred at Amphipolis, the inhabitants making him the founder of their city, and instituting yearly sacrifices and games to his memory. Brasideia were also celebrated to his honour in his native city, none but pure Spartans being allowed to join in the games. Brasidas is the only Spartan general whose character displays nobility or grandeur. He had to some extent thrown off the mental stiffness produced by the rigid oligarchical institutions of his native city. He could make himself popular with the allies, and the charm of his personal character secured for Lacedaemon many a city which would not otherwise have joined the league. Thucydides gives him great praise, describes him as being eloquent for a Spartan, and mentions his reputation for justice, liberality, and wisdom. Brasidas was indeed the [9:4:217] saviour of Sparta in the early period of the war, and had he lived the contest might have come more quickly to an end.
