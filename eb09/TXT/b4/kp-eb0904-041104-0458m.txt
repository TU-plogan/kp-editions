BUCH, Leopold von (1774-1853), an eminent German geologist and geographer, was born at Stolpe in Pomerania, April 25, 1774. In 1790 he studied at the mining school of Freiberg under the celebrated Werner, one of his [9:4:412] fellow-students there being the illustrious Alexander Von Humboldt. At the age of twenty-three he published his Attempt at a Mineralogical Description of Landeck, and also an Attempt at a Geognostic Description of Silesia. He was at this time a zealous upholder of the Neptunian theory of his illustrious master. In 1797 he met his old school-fellow Von Humboldt at Salzburg, and with him explored the geological formations of Styria and the adjoining Alps. In the spring of the following year. Von Buch extended his excursions into Italy, where his faith in the Neptunian theory was for the first time shaken. In his previous works he had advocated the aqueous origin of basaltic and other formations; he was now not less clearly convinced that these owed their existence to volcanic action. In 1799 he paid his first visit to Vesuvius, which he did not again see till 1805, when he was accompanied by Humboldt and Gay-Lussac. They had the good fortune to witness a remarkable eruption, which supplied Buch with data for refuting many erroneous ideas then entertained regarding the activity of volcanoes. Three years before he had explored the south of France, and directed special attention to the extinct volcanoes of Auvergne. The aspect of the Puy de Dome, with its cone of trachyte and its strata of basaltic lava, induced him to abandon as untenable the doctrines of Werner on the formation of these rocks. The scientific results of his investigations he embodied in his Geognostical Observations during Travels through Germany and Italy, Berlin, 1802-9, 2 vols. 8vo. From the south of Europe Von Buch repaired to the north, and spent two years among the Scandinavian islands, making many important observations on the geography of plants, on climatology, and on geology. He also established the fact that the whole of Sweden is slowly but continuously rising above the level of the sea from Frederickshall to Abo. The details of these discoveries are given in his Travels through Norway and Lapland, Berlin, 1810. In 1815 he visited the Canary Islands in company with Christian Smith, the Norwegian botanist. His observations here convinced him that these and other islands of the Atlantic owed their existence to volcanic action of the most intense kind, and that the groups of islands in the South Sea are the remains of a pre-existing continent. The physical description of the Canary Islands was published at Berlin in 1825. After leaving the Canaries Von Buch proceeded to the Hebrides and the coasts of Scotland and Ireland. His geological excursions even into countries already repeatedly visited were continued without interruption till his 78th year. Eight months before his death, he visited the mountains of Auvergne; and on returning home he read a paper on the Jurassic Formation before the Academy of Berlin. The circumstances of Von Buchâ€™s life were singularly favourable to scientific pursuits. He inherited from his father a fortune more than sufficient for all his wants. He was never married, and was completely unembarrassed by family ties. His excursions he always undertook on foot, with a staff in his hand, and the large pockets of his over-coat filled with papers and geological instruments. Under this guise, the passer-by would not easily have recognized the man whom Humboldt pronounced the greatest geologist of his time. He died at Berlin on the 4th of March 1853. In addition to the works already mentioned Von Buch published others, of which we may specify the magnificent Geological Map of Germany, in 42 sheets, Berlin, 1832.
