BULLS AND BRIEFS, Papal, are the two kinds of authoritative letters issued by the popes in their official capacity as head of the church, the bulls being the more important. They are distinguished from each other by several marks.

A bull is written on thick polished parchment, commonly in angular Gothic characters, and in Latin; it is always open; it commonly begins with the name of the Pope, but without adding any number (e.g., Pius, not Pius IX.), then follows the term episcopus, then servus servorum Dei, then either the phrase ad perpetuam rei memoriam, or the greeting in Domino salutem et apostolicam benedictionem. It closes with the place and the date, which is commonly given according to the kalends, nones, or ides of the month and the year of the pope. The chief mark, however, of a bull is the seal. The popes use three kinds of seals—1, the signet-ring; 2, since the end of the 5th century, the bulla; 3, from the 13th century, the annulus piscatoris. A bull is sealed with the second, the bulla, and from this it derives its name. The bulla is a globular seal of lead; on the one side there is, in modern times, the heads of St Peter and St Paul, with the letters S. PE, and S. PA.; on the other side is the name of the Pope, Formerly the bulla often bore other impressions; the name of the Pope was always given, but sometimes the title Papa was impressed on the opposite side; sometimes a Scriptural image, such as the Good Shepherd. The popes evidently began to use this particular seal when, from the growing weakness of the empire, the temporal authority of the bishop of Rome began to be a real thing, and the popes assumed the consular dress and insignia; for the bτdla had been used by the emperor of Constantinople, and its use was permitted to many of the great officers of state who were accustomed to act for the emperor. The bulla was the common imperial seal, and was used not merely by the emperors of the East, but also by the early German emperors, and even by some of the minor European sovereigns. It was sometimes made of gold, sometimes of silver, often of lead, and it was not until the earlier part of the Middle Ages that the leaden bulla became the distinctive mark of a Papal charter.

“Non auro, non argento, sacra Bulla refulget, Insignit chartas plumbea forma sacras.”

The word bulla— meaning first a bubble, then any kind of small ornament “quasi inflata,” then a seal of a globular shape—came to be applied to a charter sealed with such a globular seal, and since the 15th century, exclusively to Papal letters of the first rank. If the bull is in forma gratiosa the seal is attached by threads of red and yellow silk; if in forma rigorosa, hemp is used. If the Pope issues a bull before he is enthroned, nothing is put on the seal, and the bull is commonly called bulla blanca. Before the time of Nicholas IV. such bulls were only valid if confirmed after enthroning. Since then they have been valid without confirmation. Consistorial bulls are issued after consultation with the consistory of cardinals, and are signed by all the cardinals consulted. Ducange (Gloss. Med. et Inf. Lat.) says that consistorial bulls are often sealed with the signet-ring.

A brief is not so important as a bull. It is written upon white paper, or thin parchment, in modern cursive characters, and is sometimes sent open, sometimes closed. It begins with the name of the Pope, then the title Papa, then the number of the Pope, then the phrase ad perpetuam rei memoriam, or in Domino salutem et apostolicam benedictionem ; it ends with the name of the place, and the date (the day of the month, the year a.d., and the year of the Pope), and, finally, the words sub annulo piscatoris. The principal mark of the brief is its seal. It is sealed with red wax, with the signet called “the fisherman’s ring,” which dates from the 13th century, and bears a representation of St Peter fishing in a boat, and the name and the number of the Pope. The distinction between briefs and bulls is not much older than the 15th century. In the early Middle Ages the word breve was used to denote all sorts of short charters, and Ducange in his Glossary gives over a hundred different kinds of these. Papal bulls and briefs, like all other important legal instruments, are liable to be forged, and hence Roman Catholic jurists have made a special study of the various marks by which they are able to tell the age of a charter. The bulls and briefs of greatest importance have been published in Bullaria collections which have been put forth at different times under the authority of the church. The most important of those collections is the Bullarium Magnum Romanum, a Leone Magno usque ad Benedictum XIV., Luxembourg , 1727-1758, 19 vols. fol., and its continuations.
