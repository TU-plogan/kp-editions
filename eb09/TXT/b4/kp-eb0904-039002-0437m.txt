BROWNE, William George, an eminent traveller, was born at Great-Tower-Hill, London, July 25, 1768. At seventeen he was sent to Oriel College, Oxford. Having had a moderate competence left him by his father, on leaving the university he applied himself entirely to literary pursuits. But the fame of Bruce’s travels, and of the first discoveries made by the African Association, determined him to become an explorer of Central Africa. Accordingly, he left England at the close of 1791 and arrived at Alexandria in January 1792. He spent a few months in visiting Siwah, the supposed site of the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and employed the remainder of the year in examining the whole of Egypt. In the spring of 1793 he visited Suez and Sinai, and in May set out for Darfûr. This was his most important journey, in which he acquired a great variety of original information. He endured much hardship, and was unable to effect his purpose of returning by Abyssinia. He did not reach Egypt till 1796; after this he spent a year in Syria, and did not arrive in London till September 1798. In 1800 he published his travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria, from the year 1792 to 1798, in one volume 4to. The work was highly esteemed, and is classed by Major Rennell [9:4:391] among the first performances of the kind; but, from the abruptness and dryness of the style, it never became very popular. In 1800 Browne again left England, and spent three years in visiting Greece, some parts of Asia Minor, and Sicily. In 1812 he set out on amore extensive journey, proposing to penetrate to Samarkand, and survey the most interesting regions of Central Asia. He spent the winter in Smyrna, and in the spring of 1813 proceeded through Asia Minor and Armenia, made a short stay at Erzeroum, and arrived on the 1st of June at Tabriz, where he met Sir Gore Ouseley. About the end of the summer of 1813 he left Tabriz for Teheran, intending to proceed thence into Tartary; but unhappily he never reached that destination. Near the banks of the Kizil-Ouzen his party were attacked by banditti, and, according to the report of the survivors, Browne was plundered and murdered. Suspicion attached to his companions, and even to the Persian Government, but nothing occurred to confirm these surmises. Some bones, believed to be his, were afterwards found and interred near the grave of Thevenot, the celebrated French traveller. His volume of travels in Africa has already been mentioned. Robert Walpole published in the second volume of his Mémoire relating to European and Asiatic Turkey (4to, 1820), from papers left by Browne, the account of his journey in 1802 through Asia Minor to Antioch and Cyprus; also “Remarks written at Constantinople.”
