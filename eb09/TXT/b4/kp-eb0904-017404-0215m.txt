BOURBONNE-LES-BAINS, a town of France, in the department of Haute-Marne, in the arrondissement of Langres, and 21 miles E.N.E. of that town. It is much frequented on account of its hot saline springs, which are found on the site of the old Roman baths. The heat of these springs varies from 120° to 156° Fahr. The number of visitors is upwards of 800 annually. The principal buildings are a church of the 13th century, the town-house, and the hospital; there are also the remains of a castle and a priory. The manufacture of beet-root sugar is carried on in the town, and gypsum and alabaster are quarried in the neighbourhood. Population in 1872, 4038.
