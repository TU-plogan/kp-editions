BORGHESE, a noble Sienese family, one of whom, on being elected pope in 1605, assumed the name of Paul V., after which the family became among the most powerful of the Romau nobility by their union with the Aldobrandini. Camillo Filippo Ludovico, Prince Borghese (born 1775), married in 1803 Pauline, sister of the Emperor Napoleon, and widow of General Leclerc. In 1806 he was made duke of Guastalla, and for some years acted as governor of the Piedmontese and Genoese provinces. After the fall of Napoleon he fixed his residence at Florence, where he died in 1832. The Borghese palace at Rome is one of the most magnificent buildings in the city, and contains a splendid gallery of pictures.
