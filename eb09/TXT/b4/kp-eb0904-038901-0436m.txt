BROWNE, Charles Farrar, an American humorous writer, best known under his nom, de plume of Artemus Ward, was born at Waterford, Maine, in 1834. He began life as a compositor and occasional contributor to the daily and weekly journals. In 1858 he published in the Cleveland Plaindealer the first of the “Artemus Ward” series, which in a collected form attained great popularity both in America and England. In 1860 he became editor of Vanity Fair, a humorous New York weekly, which proved a failure. About the same time he began to appear as a lecturer, and by his droll and eccentric humour attracted large audiences. In 1866 he visited England, where he became exceedingly popular both as a lecturer and as a contributor to Punch. In the spring of the following year his health gave way, and he died of consumption at Southampton on the 6th March 1867. For a critical estimate of his works see the article American Literature, vol. i. p. 728.
