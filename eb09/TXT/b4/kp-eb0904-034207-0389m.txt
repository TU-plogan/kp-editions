BRIDLINGTON, Brellington, or Burlington, a market-town of England, in the East Riding of Yorkshire, on the North-Eastern Railway, 23 miles from Scarborough. It lies about a mile from the coast on a gentle acclivity. The streets are narrow and the houses irregularly built. A large chamber over the old priory gateway (of the time of Richard II.) is used as a town-hall. The town has also a corn exchange, a temperance hall, a mechanics’ institute, and two subscription libraries. The parish church of St Mary’s preserves a considerable part of the Augustinian priory which was erected in the 12th century, by Walter de Gaunt, a relative of the Conqueror, and continued to flourish till 1537, when its last prior was executed for taking part in the “Pilgrimage of Grace.” On the coast is situated the pleasant watering-place of Bridlington Quay, which has recently increased in reputation. The harbour is enclosed by two stone piers, and there is good anchorage in the bay. The beach consists of a fine firm sand, and is bordered by a parade with ornamental gardens. Besides hot and cold baths, there is a chalybeate spring esteemed for its medicinal properties; and the town is supplied with drinking-water from an intermittent fountain discovered below high water mark in 1811. The most important public building is the Victoria Rooms, which comprise a ball-room, a reading-room, a news-room, &c. The united population of Bridlington and Bridlington Quay, which in 1851 was 2432, amounted in 1871 to 6203. Bridlington was placed by Henry I. under the civil jurisdiction of'the priors, and by John was allowed to hold a market and an annual fair. In 1643 the town was cannonaded by Admiral Batten, on account of the presence of Queen Henrietta, who had landed with a supply of arms. Sir George Ripley and John de Bridlington were connected with the priory; Kent the landscape-gardener was a native of the town: and his patron, Robert Boyle, bore the title [9:4:343] of earl of Burlington, from which the name of Burlington House in London is derived.
