GUARINO, also known as Varinus, and surnamed from his birthplace Favorinus, Phavorinus, or Camers (c. 1450-1537), lexicographer and scholar, was born at Favora near Camerino about 1450, studied Greek and Latin at Florence under Politian, and afterwards became for a time the pupil of Lascaris. Having entered the Benedictine order, he now gave himself with great zeal to Greek lexicography; and in 1496 published his Thesaurus cornucopiae et horti Adonidis, a collection of thirty-four grammatical tracts in Greek. He for some time acted as tutor to Giovanni dei Medici (afterwards Leo X.), and also held the appointment of keeper of the Medicean library at Florence. In 1514 Leo appointed him bishop of Nocera. In 1517 he published a translation of the Apopldhegmata of Joannes Stobaeus, and in 1523 appeared his Etymologicum Magnum, sive Thesaurus universae linguae Graecae ex multis variisque αutoribus collectus, ο, compilation which has been frequently reprinted, and which has laid subsequent scholars under great though not always acknowledged obligations. Guarino died in 1537.
