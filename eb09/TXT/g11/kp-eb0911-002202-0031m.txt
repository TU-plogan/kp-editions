GOYANNA, a city of Brazil, in the province of Pernambuco, on a river of its own name, about 10 miles from the sea. It is a well-built place, and carries on a trade in cotton, sugar, rum, hides, timber, dye-stuffs, oils, and other products of the fertile region in which it lies. Most of its exports are sent to Recife for shipment, its own port being only deep enough for the larger class of coasting vessels. The population is about 12,000.
