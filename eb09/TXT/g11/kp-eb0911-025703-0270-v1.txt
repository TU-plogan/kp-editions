GUIDO of Arezzo, an Italian monk of the 11th century, has by many been called the father of modern music, and a portrait of him in the refectory of the monastery of Avellana bears the inscription “Beatus Guido, inventor musicae.” Although these statements are manifestly exaggerated, it is none the less true that Guido’s reforms mark an enormous progress in the notation as well as in the teaching of music. Of his life little is known, and that little is chiefly derived from the dedicatory letters prefixed to two of h’s treatises and addressed respectively to Bishop Theodald (not Theobald, as Burney writes the name) of Arezzo, and Michael, a monk of Pomposa and Guido’s pupil and friend. Occasional references to the celebrated musician in the works of his contemporaries are, however, by no means rare, and from these it may be conjectured with all but absolute certainty that Guido was born in the last decade of the 10th century. The place of his birth is, beyond a doubt, Arezzo; for on the title-page of all his works he is styled Guido Aretiιvιιs, or simply Aretinus. At his first appearance in history Guido was a monk in the Benedictine monastery of Pomposa, and it was there that he invented his educational method, by means of which, according to his own statement, a pupil might learn within five months what formerly it would have taken him ten years to acquire. Envy and jealousy, however, were his only reward, and by these he was compelled to leave his monastery—“inde est, quod me vides prolixis finibus exulatum,” as he says himself in the second of the letters above referred to. According to one account, he travelled as far as Bremen, called there by Archbishop Hermann in order to reform the musical service. But this statement has been doubted, for chronological and other reasons.
[9:11:258]

Certain it is that not long after his flight from Pomposa Guido was living at Arezzo, and it was here that, about 1030, he received an invitation to Rome from Pope John XIX. He obeyed the summons, and the pope himself became his first and apparently one of his most proficient pupils. But in spite of his success Guido could not be induced to remain in Rome, the insalubrious air of which seems to have affected his health. In Rome he met agιin his former superior, the abbot of Pomposa, who seems to have repented of his conduct towards Guido, and to have induced him to return to Pomposa; and here all authentic records of Guido’s life cease. We only know that he died, on May 17, 1050, as prior of Avellana, a monastery of the Camaldulians; such at least is the statement of the chroniclers of that order. It ought, however, to be added that the 0amaldulian3 claim the celebrated musician as wholly their own, and altogether deny his connexion with the Benedictines. It is quite in accordance with the semi-mythical character of Guido’s life that a great many inventions belonging to earlier as well as to later times have been attributed to him, in the same way as Charlemagne, Arthur, and Roland have been mιde responsible for the dee de and exploits of other kings and heroes. His eulogists declare that before him church music was in a state of utter barbarism, wholly ignoring the achievements of Gregory the Great, Hucbald, and others. The notation of music by means of the neumce also, although very imperfect for practical purposes, at any rate served to give permanence to the composer’s thoughts. There is, however, no doubt that in the latter respect Guido’s method shows an enormous progress. It was he who invented, or at least for the first time systematically used, the lines of the staff, and the intervals or spatia between them, and thus fixed the principle of modern notation; and the value of thiβ innovation for educational and general artistic purposes cannot be overrated. There is also little doubt that the names of the first six notes of the scale, ut, re, mi, fa, sol, lα, still in use among Romance nations, were introduced by Guido, although he seems to have used them in a relative rather than in an absolute sense. It is well known that these words are the first syllables of six Hues of a hyrnιι addressed to St John the Baptist, which may be given here :—

Ut queant laxis resonare fibris

3/ïra gestorum ∕αmuli tuorum, Solve polluti Zabii reatum,

Sancte Joannes.

In addition to this Guido is generally credited with the introduction of the F clef. But perhaps more important than all this is the thoroughly practical tone which Guido assumes in his theoretical writings, aud which differs greatly from the clumsy scholasticism of his contemporaries and predecessors.

The most important of Guido’s treatises, and those which are generally acknowledged to be authentic, are Micrologus Guidonis de disciplina artis musicae, dedicated to Bishop Theodald of Arezzo, and comprising a complete theory of music, in 20 chapters; Musicae G tιi<ionis régulas rhythmicae in antiphonarii sui prologum prolatae, written in trochaic decasyllabics of anything but classical structure; Aliae Guidonis rcgulae de ignoto cantu, identidem in antiphonarii sui prologum prolatce∙, and the Epistola Guidonis Michaeli monacho de ignoto can' u, already referred to. These are published in the second volume of Gerbert’s Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra. A very important manuscript unknown to Gerbert (the Codex Bibliothecae Uticensis, in the Paris library) contains, besides minor treatises, an antij>ħonarium and gradual undoubtedly belonging to Guido. A comprehensive but very uncritical life of Guido has been written by Luigi Angeloni (Sopra la vita, d∙c., di Guido d ’ Arezzo). Of infinitely greater importance are the studies on the subject by Herr Kiesewetter and by Μ. Bottée de Toulmoιι. Burney’s General History of Music, and Fétis’s Biographie des Musiciens should also be consulted. A comprehensive and admirable account of Guido’s life and work by Dr W. Langhans may be found in the fourth volume of Mendel’s Musikalisches Conversations-Lexikon.
