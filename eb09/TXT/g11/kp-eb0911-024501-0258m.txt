GUELPH, the chief town of Wellington county, Ontario, Canada, is situated in a fine agricultural district on an elevation on the river Speed, a branch of the Grand River, and on the Grand Trunk Railway and the Wellington, Grey, and Bruce division of the Great Western Railway, 45 miles west by south of Toronto. The river is navigable at this point, and there is a considerable shipping trade in wheat. Abundant water power is obtained for flour-mills, saw-mills, and woollen-mills, and there are also breweries, tanneries, and manufactories for agricultural instruments and sewing machines. The population in 1871 was 687 8.
