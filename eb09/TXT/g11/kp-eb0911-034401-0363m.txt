GUZERAT or Gujarat, the name given to the northern seaboard of the Bombay Presidency, extending from 20° to 24° 45' N. lat., and from 69° to 74° 20' E. long. It is to the northern part of the presidency what the Konkan is to the south, and is bounded on the N. by Râjputânâ, on the E. by the spurs of the Vindhya and Sâtpurâ ranges, on the S. by the Konkan, and on the W. by the sea. On the mainland it comprises the British districts of Surat, Broach, Kâira, Pânch Mahâls, and Ahmedâbâd, with a total area of 10,082 square miles, and a population (1872) of 2,810,522; together with the great but scattered territories of the Gaikwar of Baroda, and also the native states of the Mahi Kânta and RewâKânta agencies, Palanpur, Radhanpur, Balasinor, Cambay, Dang, Chaurar, Bansda, Peint, Dharampur, Tharad, Sachin, Wasravi, <fcc. The term Guzerat is sometimes employed to include the peninsula of Kâthiâwâr, with its 180 petty states. The total area, inclusive of the peninsula of Kâthiâwâr, is 41,536 square miles. For an account of the history, geography, &c., of Guzerat, see the articles on the various states and districts. Guzerat gives its name to the vernacular of northern Bombay, viz., Gujarâthi, one of the three great languages of that presidency.
