GOYAZ, or, as it was formerly called, Villa Bôa de Goyaz, the chief town of the province of Goyaz in Brazil, in the valley of the auriferous Velmelho, a right-hand tributary of the Araguaia. It lies about 650 miles N.W. of Rio de Janeiro, and 700 miles S.W. of San Salvador. Asa bishop’s see, the seat of the provincial assembly, and the residence of a civil president and a military governor, it is a place of considerable importance; and with its broad streets, wide squares, and well-built houses it ranks as oιιe of the most attractive towns of Brazil. The public buildings comprise the legislative chambers, a court-house, a hospital, a prison, an institution for the assaying of gold, and a municipal slaughter-house. Goyaz was founded in 1736 under the name of Santa Anna, and it received its present designation about three years later when it was raised to the rink of a city. The population is about 8000.
