GUDGEON(Cobio), a small fish of the family Cypri- nidae (see Ichthyology), with narrow, cylindrical body, and with a small barbel at each corner of the mouth. These fishes are generally distributed over Europe, the most common being Cobio fluviatilis, called “goujon” in France, “grässling” or “gründling” in Germany, and “gobione” in Italy. They thrive in streams as well as lakes, always keeping to the bottom, and scarcely exceeding a length of 8 inches. Gudgeons differing but little from the European are equally common in China and Japan.
