GUÉRIN, Georges Maurice de (1810-1839), a French poet, whose few compositions in prose and verse, published posthumously, show him to have possessed a true and rare genius, was descended from a noble but poor family, and was born at the chateau of Le Cayla in Languedoc, 4th August 1810. He was educated with a view to the church at a religious seminary at Toulouse, and then at the Collège Stanislas, Paris, after which he procured entrance to the society at La Chesnaye in Brittany, founded by Lamennais, bishop of Rennes. Here his most intimate companions were persons whose tastes were literary rather than ecclesiastical; and his dreamy and meditative temperament found its solace and happiness more in intercourse with nature than in theological study or the exercises of piety. It was therefore only after great hesitation, and without being satisfied as to his religious vocation, that under the influence of Lamennais he joined the new religious order in August 1833; and when, in September of the same year, Lamennais, who had come under the displeasure of Rome, severed connexion with the society, Guérin’s doubts as to his vocation returned in full force, and on the 7th October he renounced his novitiate. Early in the following year he went to Paris, where he obtained an engagement on the periodical press, but finding it impossible to submit to the mental drudgery of continuous literary work he became a teacher at the Collège Stanislas. In November 1838 he married a Creole lady of some fortune; but a few months afterwards he was attacked by a malady which proved to be consumption, and which terminated by death his short period of leisure and happiness, 19th July 1839. In the Revue des Deux Mondes for May 15, 1840, there appeared a notice of Guérin by George Sand, to which she added two fragments of his writings—one a composition in prose entitled the Centaur, and the other a short poem. His Reliquiae, including the Centaur, his journal, a number of his letters, and several poems edited by G. S. Trébutien, and accompanied with a biographical and critical notice by Sainte-Beuve, appeared in 1860 in two volumes; and a translation of it was published at New York in 1867. Though Guérin was essentially a poet, his prose is more striking and original than his poetry. Its peculiar and unique charm arises from his strong and absorbing passion for nature, a passion whose intensity reached almost to adoration and worship, but in which the pagan was more prominent than the moral element. According to Sainte-Beuve, “no French poet or painter has rendered so well the feeling for nature—the feeling not so much for details as for the ensemble and the divine universality, the feeling for the origin of things and the sovereign principle of life.”

The name of Eugénie de Guérin (1805-1848), the sister of Maurice, cannot be omitted from any notice of him, if only on account of the ties of love that united them; but her Journals, published in 1861, English translation 1865, and her Lettres, published in 1864, English traυsla tion 1865, indicated the possession of gifts of as rare an order as those of her brother, though of a somewhat different kind. In her case mysticism assumed a form more strictly religious, and she continued to mourn her brother’s loss of his early Catholic faith. Five years older than he, she cherished a love for him which was blended with a somewhat motherly anxiety. In him she centred her chief earthly hopes, and after his death her only remaining earthly purpose was to rescue his name from oblivion by the collection and publication of the scattered fragments of his writings. She died, however, on the 31st May 1848, before her task was completed.
