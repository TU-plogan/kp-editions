GYÖNGYÖSF, Istvân or Stephen (1620-1704), one of the most talented Hungarian poets of the 17th century, was born of poor but noble parents in 1620. The county of his birth is variously given as Gömör or Bons, tho date as August 5 or November 3. His abilities early attracted the notice of Count Ferencz Wesselényi, who in 1640 appointed him to a post of confidence in Fülek βastle. Here he remained till 1653, when he married, and commenced his public career as an assessor of the judicial board. In 1681 he was elected as a representative of his county at the diet held at Soprony (Oedenburg). From 1686 to 1693, and again from 1700 to his death in 1701, he was deputy lord-lieutenant of the county of Gömör. Of his literary works the most famous .is the epic poem Murdnyi Venus (Caschau, 1664), which hymns the praises of his benefactor’s wife Maria Szécsi, the heroine of Murâny. Among his later productions the best known are —Ro2sa-Koszoru, or Rose-Wreath (1690), Kemeny-Jdnos (1693), Cupidô (1695), Palinodia (1695), and Chariklia (1700). His poems are chiefly remarkable for energy, feeling, and popular sentiment. The earliest edition of his collected poetical works is by Dugonics (Pressburg and Pesth, 1796); the best modern selection is that of Toldy, entitled Cfongfôsi Istvdη νdlogαtott poetai munkdi (Select poetical works of Stephen Gyöngyösi), 2 vols., 1864-65.
