GUJRÂNWÂLA, a British district in the Punjab, lying between 31° 32' and 32° 33' N. lat., and between 73° 11' 30" and 74° 28' 15" E. long., with an area (1877) of 2563 square miles, and population (1868) of 550,576. It is bounded on the N.W. by the river Chenâb, on the S. and S.E. by the districts of Jhang and Lahore, and on the E. by the district of Siâlkot. This district forms the central portion of the Rechna Doâb, intermediate between the fertile submontane plains of Siâlkot and the desert expanses of Jhang. On the northern frontier, a belt of alluvial land, some 2 to 6 miles in breadth, fringes the Chenâb throughout its course.. The southern portion of the plateau has a rich soil, with accessible water; the villages here lie close together, while the people are careful and industrious cultivators. But further south the ground becomes harder and drier until in the extreme south the bar, a flat expanse of barren land, passes slowly into the desert of Jhang. In the south-east corner of the district, the little river Degh irrigates and fertilizes a tiny valley of its own. Two or three minor watercourses are used for the purposes of irrigation in the villages through which they pass. The country is very bare of trees, and the scenery throughout is tame and in the central plateau becomes very monotonous.

The district of Gujrânwâla is essentially a modern one; yet it can claim considerable relics of the past, constructed during an early period of prosperity. It seems likely that the district once contained the capital of the Punjab, at an epoch when Lahore had not begun to exist. We learn from the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim, Hiouen Thsang, that about the year 630 he visited a town known as Tse-kia (or Tâki), the metropolis of the whole country of the five rivers. A mound near the modern village of Asazur has been identified as the site of the ancient capital. Until the Mahometan invasions little is known of Gujrânwâla except that Tâki had fallen into oblivion and Lahore had become the chief city. Under Mahometan rule the district flourished for a time; but a mysterious depopulation fell upon the tract, and the whole region seems to have been almost entirely abandoned. At the first beginning of the Sikh war, the waste plains of Gujrânwâla were seized by various military adventurers. Charat Sinh took possession of the village of Gujrânwâla, and here his grandson the great mahârâjâ Ranjit Sinh was born. The Sikh rule, which was elsewhere so disastrous, appears to have been an unmitigated benefit to this district. Ranjit Sinh settled large colonies in the various villages, and encouraged cultivation throughout the depopulated plain. In 1847 the district came under British influence, in connexion with the regency at Lahore; and in 1849 it was included in the territory annexed after the second Sikh war. Since that time Gujrânwâla has enjoyed an immunity from the catastrophes of history, with the exception of the events of 1857, which belong to the general annals of India.

The population in 1868 numbered550,576 persons,—306,296males and 244,280 females. In religion, the district is mainly Mahometan. There were five towns, namely, Gujrânwâla, Wazirâbad, Râmnagar, Eminâbâd, and Akalgarh, with a population aggregating 54,458 persons. The total cultivated area of the district amounts to 567,849 acres, while the cultivable margin reaches the high figure of 7θl,761 acres. The staple crop is wheat, which occupies one-third of the cultivated area. The other products are—barley, gram, tobacco, oil-seeds, vegetables, rice, Indian corn, pulses, cotton, and sugarcane. Irrigation is very general, 327,832 acres being artificially watered. The trade of the district is unimportant. The chief exports are agricultural produce, brass vessels, leathern bottles, and timber. The imports consist of salt, iron, cattle, spices, and English piece-goods. A great religious fair is held at Dhonkal. The principal channel of communication is the Northern State Railway from Lahore to Peshawar. The Grand Trunk road, connecting the same two places, traverses the district for 42 miles. There are 1055 miles of unmetalled road in Gujrânwâla, besides a number of local by-ways. The Chenâb is navigable throughout for the boats of the country. The revenue in 1871 was £53,560. In 1872-73 the district contained 12 civil and 19 magisterial courts. The total police force numbered 523 men, supplemented by 1092 village watchmen. Education is still very backward; the pupils in 1873 numbered in all 5818, maintained at a cost of £2469. The mean monthly temperature in 1867 ranged from 53° in January to 95° in June. The average rainfall for the eleven years ending 1867 was 24 inches. The prevalent diseases are intermittent fever and small-pox. The death-rate in 1872 amounted to 12,592, or 23 per thousand of the population.

Gujranwala, the chief town and administrative headquarters of the above district, in 32° 9' 30" N. 1at. and 74° 14' E. long., with a population in 1868 of 19,381. The town is situated on the Grand Trunk road and Northern State Railway, 40 miles north of Lahore. It is of modern creation, and owes its importance to the father and grandfather of Mahârâjâ Ranjit Sinh, whose capital it formed during the early period of the Sikh power. There is a mausoleum to Mâhan Sinh, father of Ranjit Sinh, and a lofty cupola covers a portion of the ashes of the mahârâjâ himself. The civil station lies a mile south-east of the native town. It contains the court-house, treasury, jail, dispensary, post-office, staging bungalow, and church.
