GRIMSBY, Great, a municipal and parliamentary borough and seaport town of England, county of Lincoln, is situated on the south side of the estuary of the Humber nearly opposite Spurn Head, and 17 miles E.S.E. of Hull. Since the opening in 1852, under the auspices of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company, of extensive docks occupying a space of 140 acres reclaimed from the sea, the shipping trade of Grimsby has largely increased. A new dock connecting the royal dock with the old dock was opened by the Prince of Wales July 22, 1879. A dock of 26 acres in extent for the accommodation of the coal and timber trade is in course of construction; and it is proposed still to supply additional dock accommodation by reclaiming 200 more acres from the Humber. In 1877 the number of British vessels that entered the port was 2837, with a tonnage of 355,218; of foreign vessels 847, with a tonnage of 258,243; the number of British vessels that cleared 2642, with a tonnage of 342,727; of foreign vessels 743, with a tonnage of 235,486. Steamers ply regularly between Grimsby and the more important Baltic ports. Until 1858 no fishing trawlers had their headquarters at Grimsby, but since that period they have so increased that in 1877 the fishing craft numbered 505, with a tonnage of 29,924; and Grimsby has now become one of the largest fishing ports in the kingdom. For the use of the fishing vessels a special dock of 12 acres in extent was constructed; and another of 11 acres has lately been finished, as well as a graving dock capable of holding ten smacks at a time. Ice companies have also been established, with steamers of their own for conveying ice from Norway for the use of the fisheries. Further particulars regarding the fishing trade of Grimsby will be found under the article Fisheries, vol. ix. pp. 249, 250. The principal other industries are shipbuilding, iron and brass founding, brewing, and tanning. The chief buildings, besides the large warehouses extending along the docks, are the fine old parish church restored in 1859, the free grammar school, the custom-house, the mechanicsâ€™ institute, the hospital, the corn exchange, and the townhall. A statue of the Prince Consort was unveiled 22d July 1879. The population of the municipal borough in 1861 was 11,067, and of the parliamentary borough 15,060; in 1871 the numbers were 20,244 and 26,982. The area of the former is 1737, and of the latter 16,330 acres.

Grimsby is supposed to have been the spot where the Danes landed on their first invasion of Britain. It is a borough by prescription, and one of the most ancient in the kingdom. In the reign of Edward III. it was a considerable seaport, and in 1346 it furnished that monarch with 11 ships and 170 mariners for the siege of Calais. After that period its trade fell into decay through the gradual blocking up of the harbour by the accumulation of mud and sand, until the erection of new docks about the beginning of the present century. By the Act of 23d Edward I. the town obtained the privilege of returning two members to parliament, but since the Reform Act of 1832 it has returned only one.
