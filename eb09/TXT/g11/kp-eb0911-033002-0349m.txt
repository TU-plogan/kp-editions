GÜNS (Hungarian, Koszef), the second town iu importance of the Hungarian rnegye or county of Vas (Eisenburg), near the Styrian frontier, is favourably situated on the Gyöngyös, 47° 23 , N. lat., 16° 3Γ E. long. It is the see of a bishop, and from 1648 until the recent administrative changes of 1876 was a royal free town. Among the more noteworthy buildings are the cathedral, episcopal palace, a seminary for priests, a gymnasium, the county-hall, a hospital, three monastic houses, a museum of Roman antiquities, a house of correction, and several manufactories of cloth and of earthenware. The agricultural products of the neighbourhood consist principally of fruit and wine; the trade in the latter especially is considerable. In 1870 the number of inhabitants was 6916, mostly of German extraction. The heroic defence of the fortress of Giins by Nicolas Jurisics against the army of Sultan Soliman, in August 1532, has given the town a special historical interest. In 1621 it suffered from the attacks of Gabriel Bethlen’s troops, and in 1705 the suburbs were plundered and burnt by the forces of Francis Râkôczy. In 1729 and 1777 the town suffered much from fire, and in 1813,1814, and’1821 from floods. The Eszterliâzy family long held valuable possessions in the neighbourhood, and one of their castles still stands at the northern end of the town.
