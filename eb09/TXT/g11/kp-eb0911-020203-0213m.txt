GRINDAL, Edmund (c. 1519-1583), archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Hensingham in the parish of St Bees, Cumberland, about 1519. He was educated at Cambridge, where he became fellow of Pembroke Hall in 1538, and president in 1549. In the following year he was appointed chaplain to Bishop Ridley, in August 1551 precentor of St Paul’s, in November chaplain to Edward VI., and in July 1552 prebendary of Westminster. On the accession of Mary in 1553 he took refuge on the Continent, staying chiefly at Strasburg, where he acquired a competent knowledge of German, and occupied himself also in collecting the “writings and stories of the learned and pious sufferers in England,”—the result of his inquiries being afterwards communicated to John Foxe, and incorporated by him in his Book of Martyrs. Returning to England under the new regime in 1558, he assisted in the preparation of the new liturgy, and was also one of the eight Protestant divines chosen to hold public disputes with the popish prelates. In 1559 he was appointed to the mastership of Pembroke Hall, and in the same year he succeeded Bonner as bishop of London, in which capacity he, along with Archbishop Parker, shared in 1565 in the responsibility of suspending those of the London clergy who refused to submit to the Act of Uniformity, on which account an indignant mob of clergymen’s wives appeared before his house at St Paul’s, and were with difficulty persuaded by one of the suspended clergymen to go away quietly. In 1570 Grindal was appointed to the see of York, from which he was translated to Canterbury in February 1576. Having in the same year incurred the royal displeasure by refusing to suppress the meetings held among the clergy for “the exercise of prophesying,” he was ultimately, in June 1577, by order of the Star Chamber confined to his house and sequestered for six months. As in November he refused to make a formal submission to the queen, his suspension was continued for several years; but though a petition for his restoration, which was drawn up by convocation in 1580, was not immediately granted, it would appear that in 1582 he had resumed, at least partially, the exercise of his ecclesiastical functions. About the end of this year the queen, on account of his blindness, requested him to retire on a pension, but the negotiations connected with his resignation were not completed till April 1583, and it was only after his death at Croydon, July 6th of the same year, that Whitgift, who had been nominated his successor, entered upon the see. Though [9:11:203] Grindal yielded to the peremptory orders of Elizabeth in regard to the clergy who refused to sign the Act of Uniformity, he seems on all other occasions, while conducting himself with great moderation and manifesting unvarying courtesy and an earnest desire to avoid every cause of offence, to have strenuously upheld the spiritual independence of his office. His aims were on the whole noble and unselfish, and he was zealous in his endeavours to reform the abuses of his predecessor, to improve the moral and intellectual status of the clergy, and as far as possible to conciliate and reclaim the Puritans. He was sincerely attached to Protestantism, and laid much stress on the function of preaching, a “gift” in which he himself is said to have excelled. Grindal is alluded to (as Algrind) in the seventh “aeglogue” of Spenser’s Shepheards Calender.

His literary remains, which are unimportant, have been published by the Parker society, with a biographical notice by the Rev. Wm. Nicholson, 1853. See also Strype’s Life of Grindal, London, 1710, Oxford, 1821; A Brief and True Account of Edmund Grindal, 1710; Memorials regarding his Suspension, &c., supposed by some to have been written by Sacheverel, 1710; Fuller’s Worthies ; and Hook’s Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, vol. viii.
