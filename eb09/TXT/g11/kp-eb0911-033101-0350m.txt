GÜNTHER, Johann Christian (1695-1723), German poet, was born at Striegau in Lower Silesia, on the 8th April 1695. After attending the academy at Schweidnitz, where he composed a number of verses of more than usual promise, he entered in 1715 the university of Wittenberg with the view of studying medicine; but he became idle and dissipated, contracted heavy debts, and came to a complete rupture with his father. In 1717 he went to Leipsic, where he obtained the friendship of Menck, and published a poem on the peace of Passarowitz, which acquired him an immediate reputation. Menck recommended him to the king of Poland, but unhappily the first time he appeared at court he was in a state of intoxication. From that time he led an unsettled and dissipated life, depending for an uncertain subsistence partly on money obtained for occasional poems and partly on the charity of his friends. He died at Jena, 15th March 1723, when only in his 28th year. Goethe pronounces Günther to have been a poet in the fullest sense of the term. As a lyrical poet he stands alone among his contemporaries for freedom, spontaneity, and sincerity of utterance; and his works as a whole give evidence of deep and lively sensibility, fine imagination, clever wit, and a true ear for melody and rhythm. An air of cynicism, however, which was the necessary consequence of his aimless life, is more or less present in most of his poems, and dull, vulgar, or impure witticisms are not unfrequently found side by side with the purest inspirations of his genius.

His collected poems were published in four volumes, Breslau, 1723-1735. They are also included in Tittmann’s Deutsche Dichter des 17 ten Jahrh., Leipsic, 1874. A pretended autobiography of Günther appeared at Schweidnitz in 1732, and a life of him by Siebran l at Leipsic in 1738. See also Hoffman, J. Ch. Günther, ein literarisch-historischer Versuch, Breslau, 1833; and Roquette, Leben und Dichten J. Ch. Günthers, Stuttgart, 1860.
