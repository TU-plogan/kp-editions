GUADALAJARA, a province of Spain, in New Castile, bounded on the N. by the provinces of Segovia, Soria, and Saragossa, on the E. by Saragossa and Teruel, on the S. by Cuenca, and on the W. by Madrid. In the north are some of the loftiest summits of the Guadarrama range, having their culminating point in the Pena de la Bodera; the rest of the province, forming the upper basin of the Tagus, and watered by its affluents the Alblanqueja, Tajuna, Henares, and Jarama, is comparatively level. The soil varies considerably, but is generally of a good character. Pasture occupies the larger part of the surface on the higher tracts; and the mountains, though unduly denuded, still bear considerable forests of oak and cork. The plain around Tamajon is specially adapted for cereals; and the neighbourhood of Alcarria matures all kinds of crops proper to the latitude. Iron and lead are the only minerals; the former is very abundant and has been worked from the remotest periods; the latter occurs but in small quantities. The principal productions are wheat, barley, oil, wine, silk, saffron, and flax; but the chief wealth of the province consists in sheep and wool. Manufactures and trade have been declining for many years. The province is divided into nine administrative districts; but besides Guadalajara, the capital, it has no town of importance except the episcopal see of Siguenza. The area is 4869 English square miles; andin 1870 the estimated population was 208,638. t .

Guadalajara, a city of Spain, capital of the province of the same name, is situated on an elevation not far from the eastern bank of the river Henares, which is here spanned by a stone bridge built on Roman foundations in 1758. It is a station on the Madrid and Saragossa Railway, 38 miles N.E. from Madrid, and 2395 feet above the level of the sea. It has ten churches, several convents, including that of San Francisco, founded originally by Dona Berenguela for the Templars in 1200, handsome town and county buildings (casas consistoriales) built in 1585, and a college of engineers; besides the usual hospitals, barracks, and schools. There is also a fine palace of the ducal house del Infantado, built in 1451; and the Panteon or burying-place of the dukes of Mendoza, begun in 1696 and finished in 1720 at a cost of Â£180,000, rivals in its richness the tombs of the Escorial. An extensive Roman aqueduct supplies public fountains; and there are four alamedas or promenades. The principal manufactures are soap, earthenware, and woollens. The cloth manufacture, which was [9:11:229] formerly carried on in behalf of the Government, is now in private hands. The trade of the place is chiefly in grain, flax, fruit, cloth, and silk. Population, 7900. Guadalajara is the Arriaca or Caraca of the Romans; when taken by the invading Moors it was called Wada-l-hajarah (the river of stones), of which its present name (sometimes in the mediaeval chronicles spelt Godelfare) is a corruption. It was recaptured in the days of the Cid.
