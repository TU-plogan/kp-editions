GRIMMA, a town in the circle of Leipsic, Saxony, is situated on the left bank of the Mulde, 19 miles S.E. of Leipsic. In the Middle Ages it was an important commercial town, but agriculture is now its principal industry, although its manufactures have for some time been increasing. Besides large flour-mills there are yarn-bleaching and dyeing works, and outside the town are the Golzermiihle, which include an iron foundry and manufactories of paper and machinery. The principal buildings are the old castle, founded in the 12 th century, in which the margraves of Meissen and the electors of Saxony often held court; the town-house, dating from 1442; the two normal seminaries; the real school of the second order; and the famous Purstenschule (fllustre Moldanum) erected by the elector Maurice on the site of the former Augustine monastery and consecrated in 1550, having provision for 104 free scholars and 22 boarders, and a library now numbering 10,000 volumes. In the immediate neighbourhood are the Cistercian monastery in which Catherine von Bora lived, and the village of DÃ¶ben, with an old castle in which Albert the Proud kept his father Otto i the Rich prisoner. Grimma is of Sorbian origin, and came into the possession of Germany through the emperor Henry I. The population in 1875 was 7273.
