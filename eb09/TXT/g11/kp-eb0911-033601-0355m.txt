GÜSTROW, the chief town of the Wendian circle of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Northern Germany, is situated on the Nebel and on the railway from Lübeck to Stettin, 20 miles south of Rostock. The principal buildings are the castle, erected in the middle of the 16th century, now used as a workhouse; the cathedral, dating from the 13th century, and lately renovated, containing many fine monuments and possessing a square tower 100 feet high; the town-hall, dating from the 16th century; the court-houses, the music hall, and the theatre. Among the educational establishments are the ducal gymnasium, which possesses a library of 15,000 volumes, the town real-school, the city school, the trade school, and four female schools. The town is one of the most prosperous in the dukedom, and has breweries, foundries, tanneries, sawmills, brandy distilleries, and manufactories of tobacco, glue, candles, and soap. There is also a considerable trade in wool, corn, wood, butter, and cattle, and an annual cattle show and horse races are held. Population (1875), 10,923.

Güstrow was a place of some importance as early as the 12th ^en-ι∏ι∙y, and in 1219 it became the residence of Prince Henry Burewin 11., from whom it received Schwerin privileges. From 1556 to 1695 it was the resilience of the dukes of Mecklenburg-Güstrow. In 1628 it was occupied by the imperial troops; and Wallenstein resided in it during part of the years 1628 and 1629.
