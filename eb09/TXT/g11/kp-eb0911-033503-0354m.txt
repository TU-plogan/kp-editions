GUSTAVUS ADOLPHUS UNION (Gustav-Adolf-Stiftung, Gustav-Adolf-Verein, Evangelischer Verein der Gustav-Adolf-Stiftung), a society formed of members of the Evangelical Protestant churches of Germany, which has for its object the aid of feeble sister churches, especially in Roman Catholic countries. The project of forming such a society was first broached, in connexion with the bicentennial celebration of the battle of Liitzen, on the 6th of November 1832; a proposal to collect funds fora monument to Gustavus Adolphus having been agreed to, it was suggested by Superintendent Grossmann that the best memorial to the great champion of Protestantism would be the formation of a union for propagating his ideas. For some years the society was somewhat limited in its area and operations, being practically confined to Leipsic and Dresden, but at the Reformation festival in 1841 it received a new impulse through the energy and eloquence of the Hofprediger Zimmermann of Darmstadt, and in 1843 a general meeting was held at Frankfort-onthe-Main where no fewer than twenty-nine branch associations, belonging to all parts of Germany except Bavaria and Austria, were represented. The want of a positive creed on the part of the Union tended from the first, however, to make many of the stricter Protestant churchmen doubtful of its probable usefulness; though on the other hand its purely negative attitude in relation to Roman Catholicism secured for it the sympathy of the masses. At a general convention held in Berlin in September 1846 a keen dispute arose about the admission of the Königsberg delegate Rupp, the founder of the “Free Congregations”; his exclusion, which was carried by a majority, called forth many energetic protests, and at one time it seemed likely that the society would be completely broken up. A peaceful solution of the difficulty, however, was reached at Darmstadt in 1847. Amid the complications of the Revolution of 1848 the whole movement fell into stagnation; but in 1849 another general convention (the seventh), held at Breslau, showed that, although the society had lost both in membership and income, it still was possessed of considerable vitality. From that date the Gustav-Adolf-Verein has been more definitely “evangelical” in its tone than formerly; and under the direction of Zimmermann of Darmstadt it has greatly increased both in numbers and in wealth. In 1853 the income was .£13,500; in 1858 it had risen to £21,000; while in 1876 there was divided among 1406 congregations a sum of nearly £35,000. The total number of congregations assisted up to that date was 2558, and the sums distributed amounted to an aggregate of nearly £637,000. Apart from any influence it may have had in advancing the cause of Protestantism in places where it was struggling or weak, there can be no doubt that the Union has had a very great effect in helping the various separate Evangelical churches of Germany to [9:11:336] realize the number and importance of their common interests. It ought to be added that the stricter Lutherans still continue to hold aloof from it.

The Verein has numerous special organs, of which the most important are the Darmstädter Bote des Evangelischen Vereins der Gustav-A lolf-Stiftung and Fliegende Blätter. See Zimmermann’s Geschichte des Gustav- Adolf-Vereins, Darmstadt, 1858.
