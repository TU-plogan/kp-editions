GUBEN, a town of Brandenburg, Prussia, capital of a circle in the government district of Frankfort, is situated at the confluence of the Lubist with the Neisse and at the junction of three different railways, 28 miles S.S.E. of Frankfort. It is the seat of a circle court and of a district office, and possesses three evangelical churches, an Old Lutheran church, a Catholic church, a synagogue, a gymnasium, a real-school of the first order, two higher female schools, an infirmary, and a theatre. The principal industries are the spinning and weaving of wool, dyeing, tanning, and the manufacture of pottery ware, hats, and machinery. The vine is cultivated in the neighbourhood to some extent, and there is also some trade in fruit and vegetables. The population in 1875 was 23,704.

Guben is of Wendish origin. It is mentioned in the time of the emperor Henry II., and received town rights in 1235. It was surrounded by walls in 1311, about which time it came into the possession, of the margrave of Brandenburg, from whom it passed to Bohemia in 1367. It was twice devastated by the Hussites, and in 1631 and 1635 it was occupied by the Swedes. In the latter year it came into the possession of the electorate of Saxony, and in 1815 it was, along with the rest of Lower Lausatia, united to Prussia.
