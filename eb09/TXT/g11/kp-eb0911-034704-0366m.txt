GYMNASIUM was the name applied by the Greeks to a building designed for the practice of physical exercises. From the earliest times we hear of athletic sports in honour of heroes and gods. Sometimes they are celebrated among the funeral rites of a deceased chief, sometimes they form part of a periodic festival. At first competitors exercised stript of their outer garments (γυμνοί) ; hence arose the name gymnasium. Afterwards the habit of exercising naked became universal. In the continuance of their history the Greeks grew more attached to such sports; their free active life, spent to a great extent in the open air, fostered the liking almost into a passion. The victor in any athletic contest, though he gained no money prize, was rewarded with the honour and respect of his fellowcitizens; and a victory in the great religious festivals was counted an, honour for the whole state. In these circumstances the training of competitors for the greater games became a public concern; special buildings and officials were provided for the purpose by the state. But, as gymnastics became more and more an institution of social life, the gymnasia were applied to other uses even more important. The most interesting points are the connexion with education on the one hand, with medicine on the other. Due training of the body and maintenance of the health and strength of children were the chief part of earlier education. Except the time devoted to letters and music, the education of boys was conducted in the gymnasia, where their moral training was as carefully attended to by special officers as their physical exercises. As they grew older conversation and social intercourse took the place of the more systematic discipline. Philosophers and sophists assembled to talk and to lecture in the gymnasia, which became places of general resort for the purpose of all less systematic intellectual pursuits, as well as for physical exercises. Plato, when treating of education, devotes much consideration to gymnastics (see especially Rep. iii. and various parts of Leges). Gymnastic exercises proper were designed, not merely as in Sparta, to foster the taste for war and the activity and strength needed for using weapons, but also to [9:11:348] produce graceful carriage and healthy tone of the body. According to Plato, the sophist Prodicus first pointed out the connexion between gymnastics and health. Having found such exercises beneficial to his own weak health, he formulated a method which was adopted generally, and which Hippocrates improved on. Galen lays the greatest stress on the proper use of gymnastics, and throughout ancient medical writers we find that special exercises are prescribed as the cure for special diseases. The regulation of the gymnasium at Athens is attributed by Pausanias (i. 39, 3) to Theseus; Solon made several laws on the subject; but, according to Galen, it was reduced to a system in the time of Clisthenes. Ten gymnasiarchs, one from each tribe, were appointed annually. These performed in rotation the duties of their office, which were to maintain and pay the persons that were training for public contests, to conduct the games at the great Athenian festivals, to exercise general supervision over the morals of the youths (they could, for example, remove any philosopher whose teaching they thought injurious), and to adorn and keep up the gymnasium. This office was one of the ordinary λειτουργία!., and great expense was entailed on the holders. Under them were ten sophronistae, with a salary of a drachma per day. Their duty was to watch the conduct of the youths at all times, and especially to be present at all their game3. The practical teaching and selecting of the suitable exercises for each youth were in the hands of the paedotribae and gymnastae. The latter also superintended the effect on the constitution of the pupils, and prescribed for them when they were unwell. Aliptae oiled and rubbed dust on the bodies of the youths, acted as surgeons, and administered the drugs prescribed.

The gymnasia built to suit these various purposes were large buildings which contained, not merely places for each kind of exercise, but also a stadium, baths, covered porticos for practice in bad weather, and outer porticos where the philosophers and men of letters read public lectures and held disputations. In Athens there were three great public gymnasia,—Academy, Lyceum, and Cynosarges,—and every Greek city of consequence seems to have possessed one. Ruins of them exist at Pergamus, Ephesus, Alexandria in Troas, &c., from which, and from the accounts ofVitruvius (v. 11), it would appear that all were constructed on much the same plan. The details will be found most clearly given in Rich’s Dictionary of Greek and Homan Antiquities.

Much of the healthy buoyant elasticity of mind for which the Greek race is remarkable, as well as the active and beautiful physical development which no other race has ever equalled, is due to the love of gymnastics. The plastic art also owes its perfection in the treatment of the human form to the constant opportunity which artists had of observing the nude body in various attitudes. But abuses were liable to occur. The careful provisions made by Solon and later legislators to keep up the moral character of the gymnasia did not prevent them from fostering the vice which appears so much in Greek life. Though introduced in Rome, where Nero built the first public gymnasium, gymnastics did not suit Italian habits, and never became popular.

Gymnasium, in its modern use, generally signifies a school for gymnastic exercises, but it is sometimes used also to denote a higher school intended to give immediate preparation for the universities. The latter application of the term is specially prevalent in Germany.
