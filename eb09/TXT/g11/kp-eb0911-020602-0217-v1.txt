GROEN VAN PRINSTERER, Wilhelm (1801-1876), Dutch statesman, historian, and publicist, was born at Voorburg, on August 21, 1801, received his grammar school education at the Hague, and studied law, philosophy, and history at the university of Leyden. At the age of twenty-five he published a volume of miscellaneous essays (Vers-preide Geschriften, 1826), and in 1827 he was appointed private secretary to King William I. From this post he retired in 1833, in order that he might devote himself with less interruption to the historical researches which resulted in the gradual publication of his Archives ou Correspondance inedite de la Maison T Orange-Nassau, in fifteen volumes (Leyden, 1835-64). An ardent conservative en all the ecclesiastical and political questions of the day, he entered the chamber of representatives in 1840, and took part with both tongue and pen in all the more important discussions of the years that followed, especially in those of 1848 and 1849. Between 1849 and 1865 he frequently sat in the second chamber, and from 1850 to 1855 the anti-liberal newspaper Nederlander was managed by him. The mortification which European events in 1864 and 1866 had caused him found expression in the occasional writings entitled La Prusse et les Pays-Bas, A mes amis à Berlin, and H Empire Prussien et H Apocalypse (1867). »Shortly afterwards he withdrew entirely from public affairs, but continued his literary pursuits, his latest production Maurice et Barnevelt, an able vindication of the Calvinistic prince as against the Arminian statesman, having been completed (1875) only a short time before his death, which occurred 19th May 1876. Among other works of this author may be mentioned a Handboek der Geschiedeηisvan het Vaterland (1835), and an essay entitled Ongeloof en Bevolutie (1847); but his sole claim to European celebrity rests upon the Archives, with their able if one-sided Prolegomena. The letters and documents comprised in the series are of extraordinary interest and value for the whole of the important period which elapsed between the outbreak of the revolution in the Netherlands and the establishment of the commercial oligarchy upon the death of William II.
