GURGÄON, or Goorgaon, a British district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, between 27 β 39'and 28° 30' 45" N. lat., and 76° 20' 45" and 77° 35' E. long. Bounded on the N. by Rohtak, on the W. and S.W. by portions of the Ulwar, Nâbha, and Jind native states, on the [9:11:332] S. by the Muttra district of the North-Western Provinces, on the E. by the river Jumna, and on the N.E. by Delhi, the district of Gurgâon comprises the southernmost corner of the Punjab province, and stretches away from the level plain towards the hills of Râjputânâ. Two low rocky ranges enter its borders from the south and run northward in a bare and unshaded mass toward the plain country. East of the western ridge the valley is wide and open, and essentially extends to the banks of the Jumna. To the west lies the subdivision of Rewâri, consisting of a sandy plain dotted with isolated hills. Numerous torrents carry off the drainage from the upland ranges, and the most important among them empty themselves at last into the Najafgarh y∕ri∕. This swampy lake lies to the east of the civil station of Gurgâon, and stretches long arms into the neighbouring districts of Delhi and Rohtak. Salt is manufactured from lime in wells at several villages. The mineral products are iron ore, copper ore, plumbago, and ochre. Wolves, leopards, deer, jackals, hares, and foxes are found in the district. In 1803 Gurgâon district passed into the hands of the British after Lord Lake’s conquests, and under their influence improvements made steady and rapid progress. On the outbreak of the mutiny at Delhi in May 1857, the nawâb of Farrukhnagar, the principal feudatory of the district, rose in rebellion. The Meos and many Rajput families followed his example. A faithful native officer preserved the public buildings and records at Rewâri from destruction; but with this exception, British authority became extinguished for a time throughout all Gurgâon. After the fall of the rebel capital, a force marched into the district and either captured or dispersed the leaders of rebellion. The territory of the nawâb was confiscated on account of his participation in the mutiny. Civil administration was resumed under orders from the Punjab Government, to which province the district was formally annexed on the final pacification of the country.

The census of 1868 was taken over an area of 2015 square miles, and it disclosed a population of 696,646 persons—males, 370,251; females, 326,395. The Hindus number 480,307; Mahometans, 216,147; Sikhs, 130; and “others,” 62. In 1875-76 there were four municipal towns, with populations as follows :—Rewâri, 25,237; Ferozepore (Firozpur), 10,580; Palwal, 13,542; Farrukhnagar, 10,611. Gurgâon, the administrative headquarters, had in 1868 a population of 3539. Out of a total area of 1,267,335 acres, as many as 967,440 were returned in 1875-76 as under cultivation. The principal products are wheat, barley, joAr, bâfra, gram, oil-seeds, pulses, cotton, and tobacco. Owing to the deficiency of artificial irrigation, Gurgâon must always be exposed to drought. Seven periods of dearth have occurred since the disastrous year of 1783. In 1833 and 1837 many villages, according to report, lost their whole population through death and emigration. The traffic of Gurgâon district centres entirely upon the town of Rewâri, which ranks as one of the chief trading emporiums in the Punjab. Its merchants transact a large part of the commerce between the states of Râjputânâ and the northern provinces of British India. Salt from the Sambhar Lake, together with iron, forms the principal import; sugar and English piece-goods form the chief items of the return trade. In 1871-72 the imports of Rewâri were valued at £208,892, and the exports at £99,028. The means of communication are not of the highest order. One good metalled road traverses the district, from Delhi to Muttra, but the lines of greatest mercantile importance are unmetalled. The Râjputânâ State Railway now passes through the district, with stations at Gurgâon, Jhârsa, Jataoli, Kalipur, and Rewâri. The total revenue in 1875-76 was £111,885. In the same year 13 civil and revenue judges had jurisdiction, and the police force numbered 605 men, supplemented by a body of village watchmen. The number of schools was 66, with a joint roll of 3560 pupils. The summer heat of Gurgâon reaches a great intensity; no record of temperature, however, exists. The average annual rainfall for the eight years ending 1873-4 was 23‘52 inches. The district contained 4 charitable dispensaries, affording relief (1875) to 18,034 persons.
