GRIQUALAND WEST, a province in South Africa, comprising the territory formerly belonging to the western division of the Griqua people, which was annexed to the British empire October 27, 1871. The extent of the province is 17,800 square miles. It is bounded on the S. by the Orange River (which separates it from the Cape Colony), on the N. and N.E. by territory occupied by the Bechuana tribes and the Transvaal settlement, and on the E. by the Orange Free State. The general elevation of the country is about 3000 feet above sea-level; its characteristic features are undulating grassy plains, alternating with low ranges of rocky hills and sandy downs. The Vaal river flows through the principal districts, receiving in its course the Hart River and Modder River, with its affluent the Riet River, before its junction with the Orange River. A portion of the territory is adapted for sheep-farming, and the river basins contain fertile lands suitable for agricultural purposes. But the great wealth of the country is in its diamond mines. Since the first discovery of diamonds, in 1867, the total value of the gems exported from the province up to the close of the year 1878 is estimated at £20,000,000. Digging operations were at first confined to the alluvial deposits on the banks of the Vaal River, but in 1871 mines were opened in the locality known as the “dry diggings,” which have since received the names of Kimberley, De Beer’s, Du Toit’s Pan, and Bultfontein, all situated within a radius of a few mile3. The area of the diamond-producing ground at each of these places is distinctly defined. At Kimberley the mine covers only 9 acres, at De Beer’s 14 acres, at Du Toit’s Pan 41 acres, and at Bultfontein 22 acres. These circular areas appear to be “throats” or “pipes” through which the volcanic and serpentinous matter containing the sparkling gems have been erupted; the surrounding rock consists of sandstones and shales entirely barren of diamonds. Kimberley, the chief centre of the mining industry, is the capital of the province and the seat of government. There is a resident lieutenant-governor or administrator, who is assisted by an executive council, and a legislative council composed of members partly elective and partly nominated by the crown. There is also a high court of justice presided over by a resident recorder. The other towns are Du Toit’s Pan (including Bultfontein), Barkly, and Griqua Town. The villages and native locations are Hebron, Likatlong, Boetsap, Campbell, and Douglas. Among the river diggings or encampments are Pniel, Waldek’s Plant, Sifonell, and Setlacomie’s. A census taken in 1877 showed the total population of Griqualand West at that time to be 45,277, of whom 12,347 were Europeans.
