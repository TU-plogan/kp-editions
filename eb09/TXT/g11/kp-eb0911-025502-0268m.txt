GUIBERT, or Wibert(c. 1030-1100), of Ravenna, better known as the antipope Clement III., was born of noble parents in the 11th century at Parma, where, on attaining the canonical age, he entered the priesthood. During the minority of Henry, Guibert was appointed by the empress Agnes to the chancellorship of the kingdom of Italy; and in this capacity he steadfastly resisted, in the interests of the crown, the innovations of Hildebrand in relation to papal elections. For his services in this he was rewarded with the archbishopric of Ravenna, to which he was consecrated in 1073; his fidelity to Henry during the struggles which followed Hildebrand’s accession to the papal throne as Gregory VII. led to his being ecclesiastically suspended in 1075. By thirty bishops of the imperialist party he was elected pope at Brixen in 1080, an election which was confirmed by the synod which Henry had convened in Rome in 1084, Guibert assuming the title of Clement III. Although it was from his hands that Henry received his coronation, Clement III. met with scant recognition from the clergy and exercised few papal functions; and his name is not enrolled in any list of popes. He died in September 1100, and was buried at Ravenna; by the order of Paschalis II. his ashes were afterwards disinterred and scattered to the winds. See Giesebrecht’s Kaisergeschichte, vol. iii.
