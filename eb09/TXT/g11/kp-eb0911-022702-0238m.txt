GUACO, Huaco, or Guao, also Vejuco and Bejuco, terms applied to various Central and South American and West Indian plants, in repute for alexipharmic and curative virtues. The Indians and negroes of New Granada believe the plants known to them as guaco to have been so named after a species of kite, thus designated in imitation of its cry, which they say attracts to it the snakes that serve it principally for food; they further hold the tradition that their antidotal qualities were discovered through the observation[9:11:228] that the bird eats of their leaves, and even spreads the juice of the same on its wings, during contests with its prey. The disputes that have arisen as to what is “the true guaco” are to be attributed mainly to the fact that the name3 of the American Indians for all natural objects are generic, and their genera not always in coincidence with those of naturalists. Thus any twining plant with a heartshaped leaf, white and green above and purple beneath, is called by them guaco (R. Spruce, in Howard’s Heτιeva Quinologiα, “Cinchona succirubra,” p. 22, note). "What is most commonly recognized in New Granada as guaco, or Vejucο del guaco, would appear to be the Mikania Guaco of Humboldt and Bonpland (Pl. Equinox., ii. 86, pl. 105, 1809; D. C., Prodr., v. 193), a climbing Composite plant of the tribe E upatoriacece, affecting moist and shady situations, and having a much-branched and deep-growing root, variegated, serrate, opposite leaves, and dull-white flowers, in axillary corymbs. The whole plant emits a disagreeable odour. J. Fauré (Joum. de Pharm., xxii. 291, 1836) obtained from leaves of a Mexican guaco, besides a waxlike matter, a substance analogous to tannin, and other bodies, a light-brown bitter resin, guacin, soluble in alcohol and partly so in water, and stated by Pettenkofer to possess emetic properties, and to give off an intoxicating odour when triturated with sulphuric acid (Watts, Diet, of Chern., ii. 945). Guaco has been highly recommended for the treatment of bites of venomous reptiles and insects, and in cholera, chronic dysentery, gonorrhoeal and syphilitic affections, atonic deafness, abscess, sciatica, sprains, gout, and other complaints. Its efficacy against poisoning by snakes, first carefully experimented on by Mutis^[1. Mutis’s plant is believed by N. Pascal to have probably been the above mentioned Mikania Guaco, and not, as supposed by Guillemin, the Spilanthes ciliata of Kunth, called guaco in Central America. ] about 1787, has been frequently since attested; and in parts of New Granada much infested by those pests, a kind of inoculation with it is practised by some persons, the juice of the leaves being applied, at intervals of a fortnight during several months, to incisione in the hands, feet, and sides of the chest, two large teaspoonfuls of the same juice having beforehand been administered internally.^[2. According to J. Hancock (Observations on Brit. Guiana, p. 24, 1835), the operation is not of Indian origin. ] It is stated that the Indians of Central America, after having “guaconized” themselves, i.e., taken guaco, catch with impunity the most dangerous snakes, which writhe in their hands as though touched by a hot iron (B. Seemann, Hooker's Joum. of Dot., v. 76, 1853). The odour alone of guaco has been said to cause in snιkes a state of stupor and torpidity; and Humboldt, who Observed that the near approach of a rod steeped in guaco-juice was obnoxious to the venomous Coluber corallinus, was of opinion that inoculation with it imparts to the perspiration an odour which makes reptiles unwilling to bite.

The huαco hembra and huaco macho of Mexico are the species Mikania angulata and Μ. repanda, La Ll., respectively. Among the best remedies for snake-bites, according to Martins (Reise, i. 279, 1823; Syst. Mat. Med. Brasil., p. 44, 1843), is the recently expressed juice of Eupatoriam Ayapana, Ventenat (D. C., Prodr., v. 169), a native of the Amazons. On the Orinoco the most esteemed guaco is an Aristolochia, distinguished often as guaco del monte from the Mikaniae, or guaco del rastrojo, so called from their trailing about stubble and deserted “chacras.” A similar plant, with highly aromatic root and stem, is known in the Andes as MachΛcin∙hwisca, or snake-vine. The guaco denominated in the Peruvian Andes bcjuco (climber) de la estrella, and contrayerba (counter-herb, or antidote) de bejuco, is the Aristolochia fragran∙ tissiιna of Ruiz (Howard, loc. c⅛., p. 9; D. C., Prodr., xv., pt. i., 463). The tincture of the root and stem of a Mexican guaco (Pharm. Society’s Coll., 497α), also an Aristolochia, is administered in hydrophobia. Among allied species accredited with the properties of guaco are A. anguicida, L., a native of Cartagena in Colombia; A. cymbifera, Mart.; A. macroura, Gomez; A. trilo∙ bata, L.; A. sempervirens, L., supposed t® be the plant with which the Egyptian jugglers stupefy snakes; A. Serpentaria, L., or Virginian snake-root; Asarum canadense, L., the Canada snake-root, or “wild ginger”; and Asarum virginicum, Willd. The guaco or arbol of Panama is the species Crcιtceva tapioides, D. C., called tc.tlaihian by the Mexican Indians. In the West Indies and Mexico Comocladia dentata, Juss,, is employed as guaco; C. integrifolia, L., the brésillet of some authors, resembles it in properties. According to E. Otto (Reiseervinernngen an Cuba, &c., pp. 75, 76, 1843), C. ilicifolia, Swartz, a small tree with excessively noxious sap, is the guaco of Trinidad in Cuba, where it is used in cholera and yellow fever.
