GRYNAeUS, or Gryner, Johann Jakob (1540-1617), a learned theologian of the period immediately succeeding the Reformation, was born, October 1, 1540, at Bern, where his father Thomas, nephew of Simon Grynaeus, was at that time a teacher of theology, was educated at Basel, and in 1559 received an appointment as curate to his father who had become pastor of Röteln in Baden. In 1563 he proceeded to Tübingen for the purpose of completing his theological studies, and in 1565 he returned to Röteln as successor to his father. Here, as the result of much reading and reflexion, he felt compelled to abjure the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord’s Supper, and to renounce the Formula Concordias. Called in 1575 to the chair of Old Testament exegesis at Basel, he became involved in unpleasant controversy with Simon Sulzer and other champions of Lutheran orthodoxy; and in 1584 he was glad to accept an invitation to Heidelberg, where two years were spent. Returning to Basel in 1586 as antistes or superintendent of the church there, he exerted for upwards of twenty-five years a very considerable influence upon both the church and the state affairs of that community, and acquired a wide reputation as a skilful theologian of the school of Zwingli. Five years before his death, which occurred August 13, 1617, he had the misfortune to become totally blind, but he continued to preach and lecture to the last.

His numerous works include commentaries on various books of the Old and New Testament, Theologica theoremata et problemata (1588), and a collection of patristic literature entitled Monumenta S. Patrum Orthodoxographa (2 vols, fol., 1569).
