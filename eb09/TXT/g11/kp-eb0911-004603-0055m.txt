GRANADILLA, the name applied to Passiflora quadrangularis, Linn., a plant of the natural order Passifloreoe, a native of tropical America, having smooth, cordate, ovate, or acuminate leaves; petioles bearing from 4 to 6 glands; an emetic and narcotic root; scented flowers; and a large, oblong fruit, containing numerous seeds, imbedded in a subacid edible pulp. The granadilla is sometimes grown in British hothouses. The fruits of several other species of Passiflora are eaten. P. laurifolia is the “water lemon,” and P. maliformis the “sweet calabash” of the West Indies.
