GUIBERT (1053-1124), of Nogent, a theological and historical writer, who flourished at the close of the 11th and the beginning of the 12th century, was born of rich and noble parents at Clerrnont-en-Beauvoisis on Easter Eve 1053. Dedicated from infancy to the service of God and the Virgin, he received his early education at the Benedictine abbey of Fley (Flaviacum) or St Germer, in the diocese of Beauvais; there he gave himself with great zeal to study, but chiefly of the secular poets, until a severe illness brought about a crisis in his spiritual life, in consequence of which he began to fix his attention almost exclusively upon the Holy Scriptures and the writings of the fathers, especially of Augustine and Gregory the Great. About this period he was largely influenced by personal intercourse with Anselm, afterwards of Canterbury, who at that time was head of the priory of Bee in the neighbourhood of St Germer’s. Encouraged by his friend he now devoted his energies to Old Testament exegesis, and wrote a commentary upon the narrative of the creation; this was followed by other literary works both in verse and in prose. In 1104, when he had completed his fiftieth year, he was chosen to be head of the abbey of Notre Dame de Nogent, and there the remainder of his life was spent in a high degree of theological and ecclesiastical activity. He died in 1124.

His works, edited by D’Achery, were first published in 1651, in one volume folio, at Paris (Venerabilis Guiberti Abbatis B. Maria, de Novigento Opera Omnia) ; they include, besides minor works, a treatise on homiletics (Liber quo ordine sermo fieri debeat) ; ten books of Moralia on Genesis, begun in 1084, but not completed until 1116, composed on the model of Gregory the Great’s Moralia vn Jobum; five books of Tropologia on Hosea, Amos, and the Lamentations; a treatise on the Incarnation, against the Jews; four books De Pignoribus Sanctorum, a remarkably free criticism on the abuses of saint and relic worship; eight books of the Historia qua dicitur Gesta Dei per Francos, sive Historia Hierosolymitana, a history of the first crusade, which constitutes one of our best authorities on the events with which it deals; and three books De Vita Sua, sive Monodiarum. See Migne’s Patrologie Latine, vols. clvi. and clxxxiv.
