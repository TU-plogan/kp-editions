GUIDICCIONI, Giovanni, one of the best Italian poets of the first half of the 16th century, was born at Lucca in 1480, and died at Macerata in 1541. He occupied a high position, being bishop of Fossombrone and president of Romagna. The latter office nearly cost him his life; a murderer attempted to kill him, and had already touched his breast with his dagger when, conquered by the resolute calmness of the prelate, he threw away the weapon and fell at his feet, asking forgiveness. The Rime and Letters of Guidiccioni are models of elegant and natural Italiau style. The best editions are those of Genoa (1749), Bergamo (1753), and that recently published at Florence.
