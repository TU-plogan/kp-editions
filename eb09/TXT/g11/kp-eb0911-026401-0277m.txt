GUIMARÃES, a fortified city of Portugal, province of Minho, government district of Braga, is beautifully situated on the Ave, 12 miles south-east of Braga. It stands on an acclivity, and with its Moorish towers has a very picturesque appearance. An old castle which was the birthplace of Alphonso, the first king of Portugal, is still in a state of good preservation. Among the four churches may be mentioned the Coilegiata, founded in 1385, and although modernized still retaining intact its beautiful choir. The principal manufactures are knives and other steel wares, leather, paper, and table linen. In the neighbourhood there are sulphurous springs, with a temperature of 164° Fahr., frequented since the origin of the city in the 4th century. Guimaraes was made the chief town of the countship of Portugal in the 11th century by Henry of Burgundy, and retained that honour till 1511, when it was conferred by King Emanuel on Lisbon. The population is about 10,000.
