GREGORY X., pope from 1271 to 1276, succeeded Clement IV. after the papal chair had been three years vacant; his election occurred while he was engaged in a pilgrimage to Saint Jean-dâ€™Acre. On his arrival at Rome his first act was to summon the council which met at Lyons in 1274 for the purpose of considering the Eastern schism, the condition of the Holy Land, and the abuses of the Catholic Church. It was while returning from that council that he died at Arezzo on the 10th of January 1276. To him is due the bull which, subsequently incorporated into the code of canon law, continues to regulate all conclaves for papal elections. He was succeeded by Innocent V.
