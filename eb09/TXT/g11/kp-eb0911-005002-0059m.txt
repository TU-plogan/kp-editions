GRANSON, Grandson, or Grandsee, a small town in Switzerland, canton of Vaud, is situated near the southwestern extremity of the Lake of Neufch√¢tel. It possesses the ruins of an old castle, containing a collection of antiquities, and has a very ancient church, once connected with a Benedictine abbey, with a number of pre-Christian images. The town is of Roman origin. It was captured in 1475 by the Eidgenossen, and retaken in the following year by Charles the Bold; but in March of that year the Eidgenossen again defeated him near Granson with great slaughter. From that time till 1803 it was one of their lordships. The site of the battle is marked by three great blocks of marble. The population of the town in 1870 was 1587.
