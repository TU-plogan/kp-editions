GUADALAJARA, or in the older spelling Guadal-axara, a city of Mexico, the capital of the state of Jalisco, is situated in the Atemarac valley not far from the Rio Grande de Santiago, about 280 miles W.N.W. of the city of Mexico, in 20° 4Γ 10" N. lat. and 103° 21' 15" W. long. Owing to its considerable elevation above the sealevel (according to the Boletin del Ministerio de Fomentos, 1876, 1552 metres, but according to older authorities 1580 metres), Guadalajara enjoys an excellent climate. On the whole it is well laid out, and its streets are kept in tolerably good condition. All the houses, whether built of stone, brick, or adobe, are plastered and whitewashed, and hardly a dozen of them attain the height of three stories. In the outskirts of the town the buildings are of an inferior type. The Plaza Mayor is a square about 300 feet in each direction, one side of which is occupied by the cathedral, another side by the casa de gobierno del estado or state buildings, and the remaining sides by portales or arches in the shelter of which are some of the main shops of the city. The cathedral, commenced in 1571 and finished in 1618, is a rather fine structure with two steeples and a large dome between them covered with figures in coloured tiles. The interior is gloomy but impressive. No small interest attaches to the Hospital de San Miguel de Belen, which comprises, not only a hospital proper with male and female wards, but a lunatic asylum and a school for little children. Contiguous to it is the principal cemetery of the city, which is arranged in rather an unusual fashion: three sides of the area are bounded by walls and colonnades, and the inner surface of the walls is divided into six tiers of niches or gavetas in which the dead are deposited. Another remarkable institution is the hospicio, occupying twenty-four large blocks of building, and not only affording an asylum for foundlings and orphans, for the blind, the deaf and dumb, and the infirm of all ages, for old people unable to secure a livelihood, but also serving as a reformatory and training school. It presents a fine appearance with its dome and pillared portico. Its inmates number upwards of 1000, 700 being children, and 200 old men and women. Among the other public buildings and institutions of Guadalajara are the university (formerly the Jesuit college), eleven conventual establishments, a theological seminary, an academy for the fine arts, a mint, a theatre, and a bull-ring. The favourite promenade is the paseo which runs for a mile and a quarter through the city, and terminates northward in the alameda or public garden. Guadalajara is a fairly busy town, with paper-mills and woollen and cotton factories; but all the principal establishments are in the handsof Frenchmen, Germans, or Englishmen. The confectionery of the town is held in high repute, and the Indians of the neighbourhood are remarkable for the artistic ability with which they mould figures in clay or rags. The silk embroidery produced in the hospicio is also worthy of mention. Guadalajara was founded in 1531 by Nunez Guzman, and was made a bishop’s see in 1549. The population, which was only 19,500 in 1800, had increased to 46,804 by 1841, and to 70,947 by 1870. At Puente Grande in the neighbourhood, the Rio Grande forms a magnificent waterfall; and the bridge of Calderon is famous for the defeat of the insurgents under Hidalgo in June 1811. Several excellent views of Guadalajara will be found in Geiger, A Peep at Mexico. On the 11th of March 1875 Guadalajara was visited by a severe earthquake, which did damage to nearly every large building in the town. An account of the mint of Guadalajara, founded in 1811, is given in Bol. Soc. de geogτ. de la rep. Mexicaηa for 1871. In 1877 the value of the new coin was 1,467,660 piastres or dollars, 5000 piastres being in copper and the rest iu silver. New machinery driven by steam was imported from France in 1878. The total import trade of the town was reckoned at 3,280,000 piastres in 1878,—Great Britain having about 40 per cent, of the amount, France 25 per cent., the United States 10, and Germany 8. Full details on the money transactions of the city will be found in the Preussisches Handelsarchiv, 1879.
