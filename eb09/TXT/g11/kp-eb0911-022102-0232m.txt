GROTTAGLIE, a small city of Italy, in the province of Lecce and circondario of Taranto, about 14 miles N.E. of Taranto. It probably occupies the site of Rudiae, the birthplace of the Latin poet Ennius, afterwards known as Castel Rodelle. The name Grottaglie is due to the number of caves in the vicinity. In modern times the place is worthy of note mainly because it has given birth to several men of considerable national eminence, as is set forth in detail in Pignatelliâ€™s history of the town. An excellent red clay for the manufacture of earthenware is found at .Grottaglie. The inhabitants numbered 8747 in 1871.
