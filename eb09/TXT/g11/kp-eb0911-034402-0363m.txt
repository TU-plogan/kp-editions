GUZMICS, Izidôr (1786-1839), Hungarian theologian and scholar, was born 7th April 1786 at Vâmos-Csalâd, in the county of Sopron. His early education was conducted at Köszeg (Giins), Szombathely (Stein-am-Anger), and Sopron (Oedenburg); in the last-mentioned town he was instructed in the art of poetry by Paul Horvath. On the 28th October 1805 he entered the Benedictine order, but left it on the 30th August of the following year. Having almost immediately repented this step, he again assumed the monastic garb on the 10th November 1806. At the monastery of Pannonhegy he applied himself to the study of Greek under Farkas T<5th. In 1808 we find him 1 Various French biographical works attribute to De Morveau, in 1773, the discovery of the efficacy of acid vapours in destroying contagious miasma. W. Boraston, however, had already in 1630 remarked—“All acetosus and sower things doe so close the powers, and passages of the humours, that no venemous ayre can enter therein as by experience I have often found” (A Necessarie and Briefe Treatise of the Contagious Disease of the Pestilence, pp. 11, 12); and Dr George Thomson had in 1666 described how, preparing for the “dissection of a pestilent body,” he got in readiness “a porringer containing Sulphur to burn under the Corps,” and how, suspecting the entry into his hand during the operation of “slie, insinuating, venemous Atoms,” or, in modern phrase, septic germs, he sought to nullify their effects by holding the hand in the gas of burning brimstone (Λoimotomia or the Pest Anatomized, pp. 71 and 77-79).

at Györ (Raab), in the middle school of which town he was teaching during the two following years. In 1811 he was again at Pannonhegy, whence in 1812 he was sent to Pesth to study theology. Here he became acquainted with the works of the best German and Hungarian authors, and also took part in the editorship of the Nemzeti (National) Plutarkus, and in the translation of Hübner’s Lexicon. After about four years’ stay at Pesth, he obtained the degree of doctor of divinity, and returned to Pannonhegy, where he devoted himself to dogmatic theology and literature. So great was his activity that it is said that there was hardly an Hungarian periodical to which Guzmics was not a contributor. The most important of his theological works are— A hath, aηyaszentegyhdzηak hitbeli tanitdsa (The doctrinal teaching of the Holy Catholic Church), and A keresztényeknek vallasbeli egyesiilesokrol (On Religious Unity among Christians), both published at Pesth in 1822; also a Latin treatise entitled Theologia Christiana fundamentalis et theologia dogmatica (Györ, 1828-29, 4 vols.). Of the other literary labours of Guzmics the most meritorious is a translation of Theocritus in hexameters published in 1824. His versions of the Oe dipus of Sophocles and of the Iphigenia of Euripides were rewarded by the Hungarian Academy, of which in 1838 he was elected honorary member. From 1832 to the date of his death he was editor of the Egyhazi Tar (Ecclesiastical Treasury). In 1832 he was appointed abbot of the wealthy Benedictine house at Bikonybél, a village in the county of Veszprém. While there he built an asylum for 150 children, and founded a school of harmony and singing. He died at Bakonybél on the 1st September 1839.
