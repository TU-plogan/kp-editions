GRUTER, or Gruytère, Jan (1560-1627), a critic and scholar of Dutch parentage by his father’s side and English by his mother’s, was born at Antwerp, December 3, 1560. To avoid religious persecution his parents while he was still young came to England; and for some years he prosecuted his studies at Cambridge, after which he went to Leyden, where he graduated M.A. In 1586 he was appointed professor of history at Wittenberg, but as he refused to subscribe the formula concordioe he was unable to retain his office. From 1589 to 1592 he taught at Rostock, after which he went to Heidelberg, where in 1602 he was appointed librarian to the university. He died at Heidelberg, September 20, 1627. The chief service rendered by Gruter to classical learning was in the department of inscriptions, his principal work on which is Inscriptiones antiquoe totizιs orbis Romani, in 2 vols., Heidelberg, 1603. He also published editions of most of the Latin classics, but as his critical faculty bore little proportion to his erudition these are of small value.
