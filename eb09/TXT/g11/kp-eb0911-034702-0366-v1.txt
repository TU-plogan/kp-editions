GYGES, founder of the third dynasty, called Mermnad, of Lydian kings, reigned about 687-654 b.c. (v. Gelzer in Rhein. Mus., xxx.). The kindred name Gygaea, applied by Homer (Z∕., ii. 684) to the Maconian lake, mother of the Maconian leaders, supports the statement of ancient historians that he belonged to an old Lydian family. In the reign of Candaules, Gyges, perhaps after banishment, attempted during the troubles caused by the Cimmerian invasions into Asia Minor, to gain the royal power. He was aided by foreign, especially Carian, mercenaries, but was strenuously resisted by the native population. At last it was agreed to refer the decision between the old Heraclid dynasty and the new claimant to the national god Heracles; but, to ensure impartiality, they appealed to him under his Greek form of Apollo. The Delphic oracle gave its answer in favour of Gyges, and the presents with which his gratitude enriched the shrine were seen and described by Herodotus. This story points to familiar and friendly intercourse between Lydia and the Greek states; and that the circumstance impressed itself on the Hellenic mind is shown by many romantic tales current about the fortunes of Gyges (Plato, Rep., ii. p. 369; Herod., i. 8). The contemporary poet Archilochus speaks of the riches of Gyges. Under the Heraclid dynasty Ionian settlers had occupied the whole coast of Lydia, and in friendly relation with the country had rapidly prospered. But the warrior king who now began to rule was not content to leave the sea-coast in the undisturbed possession of foreigners. He and his successors maintained almost constant war with the Ionian cities. Gyges captured Magnesia and the lower city of Colophon; but the inroads of the Cimmerians diverted his attention from conquest to the defence of his own capital. At one time he was so hard pressed that he applied to Assyria for help (about 660 B.c.), and paid tribute to Assurbanipal in return for protection against these barbarians. But he afterwards threw off allegiance and assisted Psammetichus, who had revolted in Egypt against the Assyrian rule. It is mentioned in an inscription of Assurbanipal that Gyges was slain in battle by the Cimmerians, and that his son Ardys renewed the tribute.
