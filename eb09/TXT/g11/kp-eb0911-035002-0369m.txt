GYNAeCOLOGY (from the Greek γvvη, γυναικός, a woman, and λόγος), that branch of medicine which concerns the pathology and treatment of affections peculiar to the female sex. See Medicine.

G YOM A, an old market-town in the Trans-Tibiscan county of Békés, Hungary, is situated on the banks of the Körös main stream, 46° 57' N. lat., 20° 50' E. long. It has a fine town-hall, Roman Catholic, Calvinist, and Lutheran churches, a Jews’ synagogue, tax, post, and telegraph offices, a brewery, several elegant private residences, and a large station on the Szolnok·Arad Railway. The soil of the surrounding country, though in some places clayey, is in others of a rich and productive character, and the inhabitants succeed in raising plentiful crops of wheat, mangcorn, barley, millet, and maize, besides cultivating several kinds of orchard fruit and grapes. The more considerable landholders rear great numbers of sheep, pigs, and horned cattle. An abundant supply of fish and waterfowl is yielded by the Körös, which is here spanned over by a wooden bridge and by the railway. Enormous quantities of firewood are floated down the stream on rafts. The fields are protected from floods by a large dike, whilst a similar service is rendered by the Nagy-Ivân, Csergetyii, Jokai, and Német trenches, which usually become dry during summer. In 1870 the population of Gyoma was 9907, by nationality Magyars. Before 1682 three other communes, viz., Ege, Pô, and Nyârszeg, stood on the wide-spreading tract belonging to Gyoma. In that year they were, however, completely destroyed, and now only traces of their former existence remain.
