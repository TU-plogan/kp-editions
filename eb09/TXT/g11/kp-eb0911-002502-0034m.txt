GRABE, Johann Ernst (1666-1711), a learned divine of the Anglican Church, was born July 10, 1666, at Königsberg, where his father, the author of some treatises now forgotten, was professor of theology and history. In the course of his theological studies Grabe succeeded in persuading himself of the schismatical character of the Reformation of the 16th century, and accordingly presented to the consistory at Samland a memorial in which he compared the position of the evangelical Protestant churches with that of the Simonians, Novatians, and other ancient schismatics. Hardly, however, had he resolved to join the Church of Rome, when his peace was again disturbed by Spener and others, who had pointed out some flaws in his written argument, and called his attention to the English Church as apparently possessing that apostolic succession, and manifesting that fidelity to ancient institutions, which he desired. In 1697, accordingly, he removed to London, and received priest’s orders, attaching himself to the nonjuring party. The learned labours to which the remainder of his life was devoted were rewarded with an Oxford degree and a royal pension. He died on the 3d of November 1711, and in 1726 a monument was erected to him byLord Oxford in Westminster Abbey.

Some account of Grabe’s life is given by Dr Hickes in a discourse prefixed to the pamphlet against Whiston’s Collection of Testimonies against the True Deity of the Son and of the Holy Ghost. His works, which show him to have been learned and laborious but somewhat deficient in critical acumen, include a Spicilegium SS. Patrum el Haereticorum (1698-99), which was designed to cover the first three centuries of the Christian church, but never was continued beyond the close of the second; editions of Justin’s Apologia Prima (1700), of Irenams, Adversus omnes Hoereses (1702), and of the Septuagint {Vet. Test, juxta LXX. interpretes, 4 vols, fol., 1707-1720); also some polemical pieces now of little importance.
