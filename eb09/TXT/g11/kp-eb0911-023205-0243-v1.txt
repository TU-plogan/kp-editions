GUAN, a word apparently first introduced into the ornithologist’s vocabulary about 1743 by Edwards,^[1. Edwards also gives “Quan” as an alternative spelling, and this may be nearer the original form, since we find Dampier in 1676 writing ( Voy., ii. pt. 2, p. 66) of what was doubtless an allied if not the same bird as the “Quam.” The species represented by Edwards does not seem to have been identified by the latest authorities.] who said that a bird he figured {Nat. Hist. Uncommon Birds, pl. xiii.) was “so called in the West Indies,” and the name has hence been generally applied to all the members of the Subfamily Penelopinoe, which are distinguished from the kindred Subfamily Cracinoe or Curassows by the broad postacetabular area of the pelvie, as pointed out by Prof. Huxley {Proc. Zool. Society, 1868, p. 297), as well as by their mιxillι being wider than it is high, with its culmen depressed, the crown feathered, and the nostrils bare—the last two characters separating the Penelop>ince from the Oreophasinoe, which form the third Subfamily of the Cracidoe ^[2. See the excellent Synopsis, extensively laid under contribution for this article, by Messrs Sclater and Salvin in the Proceedings of the Zoological Society for 1870 (pp. 504-544), while further information ou the Cracinx has since been given by the former of those gentlemen in the Transactions of the same society (ix. pp. 273-288, pls. xl.-liii. ). Some additions have since been made to the knowledge of the family, but none of very great importance.] f a Family belonging to that taxonomer’s division Peristeroρodes ^[3. It would be here out of place to dwell upon the important bearings on the question of geographical distribution which the establishment of this division has tended to shew. For this reference must be made to Prof. Huxley’s original paper {ut supra), or to the epitome of it given in the Zoological Record (v. pp. 34 and 99)] i of the Order Callinοe.

The Penelopinoe have been separated into seven genera, of which Pendope and Ortalida (properly Ortalis), containing respectively about sixteen and nineteen species, are the largest, the others numbering from one to three only. Into their minute differences it would be useless to enter: nearly all have the throat bare of feathers, and from that of many of them hangs a wattle; but one form, Chamoe- petes, has neither of these features, and Sfegnoloema, though wattled, has the throat clothed. With few exceptions the Guans are confined to the South-American continent; one species of Penelope is however found in Mexico and at Mazatlan, Pipile cumanensis inhabits Trinidad as well as the mainland, while three species of Ortalis occur in Mexico or Texas, and one, which is also common to Venezuela, in Tobago. Like Curassows, Guans are in great measure of arboreal habit. They also readily become tame, but all attempts to domesticate them in the full sense of the word have wholly failed, and the cases in which they have even been induced to breed and the young have been reared in confinement are very few.^[4. Cf. Dixon {The Dovecote and the Aviary, pp. 223-273, London, 1857), who argues that the reported success of the Dutch towards the end of the last century in domesticating these birds was an exaggeration or altogether a mistake. His two chapters are well worth reading.] Yet it would seem that Guans and Curassows will interbreed with poultry {Ibis, 1866, p. 24; Bull. Soc. Imp. d ’ Acclimatation, 1868, p. 559; 1869, p. 357), and what is more extraordinary is that in Texas the hybrids between the Chiacalacca {Ortalis vetula) and the domestic Fowl are asserted to be far superior to ordinary Game-cocks for fighting purposes. More information on this subject is very desirable. (a. n.)
