GRAND HAVEN, a city of the United States, capital of Ottawa county, Michigan, is situated on Lake Michigan, at the mouth of Grand River, opposite Milwaukee, to which, as well as to the principal other towns on the lake, several steamers ply daily. It is a station of the Grand Haven Railway, and the terminus of the Detroit, Grand Haven, and Milwaukee line. On account of its fine situation and its medicinal springs, Grand Haven is becoming a favourite summer resort. It has saw and shingle mills, and manufactories of agricultural implements, of sashes and blinds, and of windmills. Shipbuilding is also carried on. In the neighbourhood there are extensive peach forests. Lumber and fruit are the principal shipments. Grand Haven was laid out in 1836, and became a city in 1867. Population (1870) 3147, now about 5000.
