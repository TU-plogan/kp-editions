GUNDULITSCH, Ivan (1588-1638), called Giovanni Gondola, one of the most celebrated Dalmatian poets, was born August 8, 1588, at Ragusa. His early education was superintended by two Jesuits, S. Muzzi and R. Ricasoli, the latter of whom instructed him in philosophy. At the age of twenty Gundulitsch applied himself to the study of jurisprudence; and three years afterwards he was entrusted with a high official post in the Ragusan republic. Farther particulars of his life are not known; he died December 8, 1638. Among his numerous poems the greatest is an epic entitled Osman u dvadeset pievanjah (Osman in twenty cantos), printed for the first time at Ragusa in 1826, and reprinted at Agram in 1854, with a biographical sketch of the author by A. T. It was written to celebrate the victory of the Poles over the Turks and Tartars in the campaign of 1621. Cantos 14 and 15 are lost, having been suppressed by the Government of Ragusa on account of their writer’s animosity against the Turks; but in their place others have been added by P. Sargo. An Italian version of this poem appeared in 1827. Of Gundulitsch’s other poems, the Hymn on the Greatness of God and the Tears of the Afflicted Son, and his dramas the Pape of Proserpine and the Sacrifice of Love, deserve notice. He also made several metrical translations from the Italian poets. Gundulitsch’s poems, besides their literary value, are specially interesting to a student of history, as they give a faithful picture of the time in which they were composed. A complete edition of his works, edited by V. Babukich, was published by the Illyrian university in 2 vols., Agram, 1847.
