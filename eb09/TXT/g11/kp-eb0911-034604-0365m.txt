GYARMATHA, a market-town in the county of Ternes, Hungary, situated in a level but productive agricultural district to the north-east of Temesvar, 45Â° 50' N. lat., 21* 17' E. long. For some distance round the town the cultivation of wheat, barley, oats, maize, and the vine is largely carried on. Horse-breeding is another source of employment to many of the inhabitants. Gyarmatha has few buildings of special interest with the exception of a Roman Catholic church and the ruins of a fort. In 1870 the population amounted to 5125, consisting of Germans, Magyars, and Wallachs.
