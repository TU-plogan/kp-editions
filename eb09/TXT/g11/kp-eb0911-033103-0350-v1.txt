GURDÂSPUR, a British district in the lieutenantgovernorship of the Punjab, lying between 32° 30' and 31° 36' N. lat., and between 74° 56' and 75° 45' E. long. Bounded on the N. by the native Himalayan states of Kashmir and Chamba, on the E. by Kângrâ district and the river Bias, on the S.W. by Amritsar district, and on the W. by Sialkot, the district of Gurdâspur occupies the submontane portion of the Bâri Doâb or tract between the Bias and the Ravi. An intrusive spur of the British dominions runs northward into the lower Himalayan ranges, to include the mountain sanatarium of Dalhousie. This station crowns the most westerly shoulder of a magnificent snowy range, the Dhâola Dhâr, between which and the plain two minor ranges intervene. Below the hills stretches a picturesque and undulating plateau covered with abundant timber and made green by a copious rainfall, and watered by the streams of the Bâri Doâb, which, diverted by dams and embankments, now empty their waters into the Bias directly, in order that their channels may not interfere with the Bâri Doâb canal. The district contains several large and important jhils or swampy lakes. Few facts can now be recovered with regard to the early annals of Gurdâspur. Our first distinct historical knowledge begins with the rise of the Sikh confederacy. The whole of the Punjab then was distributed to the chiefs who triumphed over the imperial governors. In the course of a few years, however, the famous Ranjit Sinh acquired all the territory which those chiefs had held. Pathânkot and the neighbouring villages in the plain, together with the whole hill portion of the district, formed part of the area ceded by the Sikhs to the East India Company after the first Sikh war in 1846. In 1861-62, after receiving one or two additions, the district was brought into its present shape, having its headquarters at Gurdâspur.

Owing to the numerous transfers of territory which took place between the census of 1855 anil 1868, it is impossible to give a detailed comparison of their results. The enumeration of 1868 was taken over an area of 1822 square miles, and it disclosed a total population of 906,126 persons,—males, 501,247; females, 404,879. Classified according to religion there are—Hindus, 303,107; Mahometans, 422,196; Sikhs, 79,387; anti “others,” 101,436. Only six towns have a population exceeding 5000, namely, Batâla, 26,897; Deni Manak, 7199; Dinânagar, 6626; Sujanpur, 6556; Kalanaur, 6030; and Srigovindpur, 5531. Gurdâspur, the chief town and administrative headquarters of the district, had only 4137 inhabitants in 1875. The sanatarium of Dalhousie, 7687 feet above sea-lével, though only returned as containing 2019 inhabitants, has a large fluctuating population during the warmer months. The district possesses throughout an excellent soil, except in some small patches on the Bias side, where sand covers the surface. The chief agricultural staples comprise wheat, barley, and gram for the spring harvest, with rice, pulses, cotton, and sugar-cane for the autumn crop. Abundant means of irrigation exist where required, either from canals, wells, or mountain streams; but in no part of the Punjab province can better crops be produced without such artificial aid. In 1875-76 the total cultivated area amounted to 855,675 acres, of which 140,639 acres were protected by irrigation against the effects of drought. The trade of the district consists mainly in the export of its agricultural produce. The imports are insignificant,—English piece-goods, salt, and fancy articles forming the main items. The local traffic centres on Batala. The principal road of the district connects Amritsar with Pathânkot, at the foot of the hills, and passes through Batâla, Gurdâspur, and Dinânagar. The total mileage of highways in 1875-76 showed 54 miles of metalled and 507 miles of unmetalled road. The total revenue in 1876 was £123,608. In 1875-76 the district contained 12 civil and revenue judges; and 14 officers exercised magisterial powers. In the same year the police force numbered 596 men, supplemented by a large body of rural watchmen. In 1875-76 there were 112 schools, having an aggregate roll of 5708 pupils. The climate of Gurdâspur is not unhealthy, but large swamps and excessive irrigation expose some neighbourhoods to malarious fevers and ague. The mean temperature for 1871 was 86 - 85° in May and 53’8° in December at Gurdâspur, and 67 ’ 8° in May and 46 ’ 96° in December at Dalhousie. The average annual rainfall for eight years ending 1873-74 was 30 - 96 inches. Seven charitable dispensaries afforded relief (1875—76) to 80,614 persons.
