GREIFENHAGEN, the chief town of a circle in the Prussian province of Pomerania and government of Stettin, is situated on the Reglitz, 12 miles S.S.W. of Stettin. Its prosperity depends chiefly on agriculture, and it has a considerable cattle trade. There are also linen manufactories and saw-mills. Greifenhagen was built in 1230, and was raised to the rank of a town and fortified in 1262. In the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War it was taken both by the imperialists and the Swedes, and in 1675 it was captured by the Brandenburgers, into whose possession it came finally in 1679. The population in 1875 was 6759.
