KALINGA, or Calinga, one of the nine kingdoms of southern India in ancient times. Its exact limits varied, but included the eastern Madras coast, from Pulicat to Chicacole, running inland from the Bay of Bengal to the Eastern Ghâts. The name at one time had a wider and vaguer meaning, comprehending Orissa, and possibly extending to the Ganges valley The Kalinga of Pliny certainly included Orissa, but latterly it seems to have been confined to the Telugu speaking country; and in the time of Hwen Tsang (630 a.d.) it was distinguished on the south and west from Andhra, and on the north from Odra or Orissa. The language of the country is Telugu. Taranatha, the Tibetan historian, speaks of Kalinga as one division of the country of Telinga. Hwen Tsang speaks of Kalinga (“Kie·ling-kia ”) having its capital at what may now be identified with the site either of Râjâmahendri (Rajahmundry) or Coringa. Both these towns, as well as Sinhapur, Kalingapatam, and Chicacole, share the honour of having been the chief cities of Kalinga at different periods.
