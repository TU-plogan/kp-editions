KÄNARA, or Canaea, South, a district on the western coast of the Madras presidency, India, bounded on the north by North Kânara (Bombay), E. by Mysore and Coorg, S. by Malabar, and W. by the Indian Ocean, with an area of 3902 square miles. The chief town is Mangalore. The district is intersected with rivers, none of which exceed 100 miles in length. They all take their rise in the Western Ghâts, and many of them are navigable for boat traffic during the fair weather for from 15 to 25 miles from the coast. The chief of these streams are the Netravati, Gιirpur, and Chendragiri. The general scenery of the district is varied and picturesque. Abundant vegetation, extensive forests, and numerous groves of cocoa-nut palms extend along the coast, and green rice-fields are seen in every valley. The Western Ghats, rising to a height of from 3000 to 6000 feet, fringe the eastern boundary of the district. Forest land of great extent and value exists, but most of it is private property. Jungle products (besides timber) consist of bamboo, cardamoms, wild arrowroot, gall-nuts, gamboge, catechu, fibrous bark, cinnamon, gums, resin, dyes, honey, and beeswax. The forests formerly abounded in game, which, however, is now rapidly decreasing under incessant shooting.

The census of 1871 returned a population of 919,513 (235 to the square mile), of whom 787,183 were Hindus, 82,803 Mahometans, 49,517 Christians, and 10 “others.” The only towns with a population exceeding 2000 are Mulki, Udipi, Kärikal, Bantwal, and Mangalore. The staple crop is rice. Cocoa-nut gardens are numerous along the coast, and areca plantations in the interior. Gram, beans, hemp, rdgi, sugar-cane, tobacco, and cotton are also grown, but not to any great extent. The chief articles of import consist of piece goods, cotton twist, yam, oils, and salt. The total value of imports in 1875-76 was £183,250, and the value of the exports £781,672, of which £400,000 represented coffee and£175,OOO rice. The total revenue of the district in 1870-71 was £233,776, of which £116,189 was made up by land tax. Education was afforded in 1871 by 103 Government and inspected schools, attended by 4007 pupils.
