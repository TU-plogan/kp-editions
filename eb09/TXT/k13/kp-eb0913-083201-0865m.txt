KAMENETS (Polish, Kamieniecj, usually distinguished as Podolian Karnenets to distinguish it from Lithuanian Kamenets in Grodno, is the chief town of the government of Podolia, Russia. It is situated in 48° 40' N. lat. and 26° 25' E. long., 982 miles south of St Petersburg, and occupies a high and rocky peninsula formed by the liver Smotritch, a left-hand tributary of the Dniester. Round about the town lie quite a cluster of suburban villages, the Polish Folwark, the Russian Folwark, Zinkovtsui, Karvasarui, <fcc.; and on the opposite side of the river, and accessible by a wooden bridge, stands the fine old castle which so long frowned defiance across the Dniester to Khotin. Among the ecclesiastical buildings may be mentioned the Roman Catholic cathedral of St Peter and St Paul, built in 1361, and distinguished by a minaret, which recalls the time when it was used as a mosque by the Turks; the Greek cathedral of John the Baptist, dating from the 16th century, but up to 1798 belonging to the Basilian monastery; the Orthodox monastery of the Trinity; the Catholic Armenian church, founded in 1398, and possessing among its treasures a missal of slightly earlier date and an image of the Virgin Mary that saw the Tartar invasion. The town contains further a Government gymnasium, Orthodox and Roman Catholic seminaries, Jewish colleges, and an infirmary. The population was 20,699 (11,091 males) in 1863, comprising 9965 Jews, 4987 Catholics, 69 Armenians, and 56 Protestants. In 1870 the total was 22,611.

Kamenets appears to be first mentioned in the Russian chroniclers in the end of the 12th century, though there is some doubt whether it be the Podolian town that is meant. Laid waste in 1240 by the forces of Baty, the leader of the Golden Horde, it passes out of view for nearly a century. It afterwards appears frequently in the general history of the Podolian region; and in 1434 it was made the chief town of the province of Podolia, instituteβ by Ladislaus III., king of Poland. In the course of the 15th and 16th centuries it suffered frequently from the invasions of Tartars, Moldavians, and Turks; and in 1672 the hetman Doroshenko, assisted by Mahomet 1V., made himself master of the place. Restored to Poland by the peace of Carlowitz (1699), it passed with Podolia to Russia in 1795, and on the constitution of the Podolian government in the following year obtained the rank of government town.
