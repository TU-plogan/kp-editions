KANAUJ, an ancient city in Farrukhabad district, North-Western Provinces, India, 27° 2' 30" N. lat., 79° 58' E. long., with a population in 1872 of 17,093, viz., 10,864 Hindus and 6229 Mahometans. Kanauj in early times formed the capital of a great Aryan kingdom, and the Gupta dynasty extended their sway over a large portion of Upper India. The prosperity of the city dates from a prehistoric period, and seems to have culminated about the 6th century. In 1018 it fell before Mahmιid of Ghazni, and again in 1194 before Muhammad Ghori. The existing ruins extend over the lands of five villages, and occupy a semicircle fully 4 miles in diameter. Among the antiquities the shrine of Râjâ Jaipâl ranks first in interest The great mosque, which bears the name of Site’s Kitchen, also dates back to Hindu times. Hinduism in Lower Bengal dates its legendary origin from a Brâhman migration southwards from this city, about 800 or 900. To this day all Brâhmans in the lower provinces trace their descent from one or other of the five Brâhman emigrants from Kanauj.
