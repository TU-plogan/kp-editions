KALAMAZOO, the county seat of Kalamazoo county, Michigan, U.S., 40 miles east of Lake Michigan, and equidistant from Chicago and Detroit, at the intersection of four railways, in the centre of one of the finest agricultural districts in the country. The public institutions include Kalamazoo College, the Michigan Female Seminary, and an asylum for the insane. About one-third of all the windmills in the United States are made here. Agricultural implements, carriages, steel springs, paper and milling machinery are among the chief manufactures; and there are also extensive planing mills and flour mills. The population of the township in 1880 was 13,552, including the village population of 12,012.
