KAMPEN, a town of Holland, in the province of Overyssel, stretches for nearly a mile along the left bank of the Yssel, about 3∣ miles above the mouth of the river. It is connected by railway with Zwolle. The town is traversed in its whole length by a canal, and the old walls have been transformed into promenades and drives. Three of the town gates are good examples of the style of such architecture in the 16th and 17th centuries. Of the seven churches the most noteworthy is St Nicholas, which ranks with the cathedral of Utrecht and St John’s of Bois-le-Due as one of the three great mediaeval churches in the Netherlands. The town-hall, dating partly from the 16th century and partly from the 18th, is of interest both from its architecture and decorations and for the value of the archives. There are a theological seminary, a gymnasium, an upper burgher school, and a municipal school of design; among the beneficent foundations the most notable is the Great Orphanage. The pasture land of the vicinity fosters a considerable trade in dairy produce; and there are shipyards, rope-walks, a tool factory, cigar factories, paper mills, &c. The inhabitants numbered 7760 in 1840, 11,903 in 1870, and 16,454 in 1876.

Kampen (variously Latinized as Campae, Campi, and Campania ad Isalam} appears as early as 1172, and soon acquired municipal rights. In the 14th century it was the seat of a nourishing cloth manufacture, and as a member of the Hanseatic League it developed a large trade with Denmark and various parts of the Low Countries and Germany. The town was vainly besieged by Duke John of Bavaria in 1400 and by Jan van Ens in 1493. During the great wars of the 16th century it was occupied by the forces of the States in August 1572, a little later captured by Don Frederick, recovered for the States by Rennenberg in 1578, and attacked without success by Verdugo in 1584. The Minister party obtained possession of Kämpen in 1672, but were expelled by the French in 1673.

Kämpen is to the Dutch what Gotham is traditionally to the English, or Schilda and Schöppenstadt to the Germans. See E. Moulin, Histor. Hamper Kronijk ; Havard, Cities of the Zuyder Zee, 1876.
