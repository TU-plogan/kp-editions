KAADEN, chief town of a department in the circle of Eger, Bohemia, is situated on the Eger, about 60 miles north-west of Prague. The town lies about 2 miles E. of the station of Kaaden-Brunnersdorf, on the railway between Eger and Carlsbad, and consists of an old town, surrounded by a wall, and two suburbs. It contains two convents, a commercial school, and a school of agriculture. The chief buildings are the Late Gothic Franciscan church, and the town-house with a noteworthy tower. The manufactures include gloves and beet-root sugar: there is some trade in wood and grain; and mining for anthracite and a mineral colouring material, yielding Kaaden~green, is carried on in the neighbourhood. Kaaden was founded about 820: in 1277 it became a free city; and in 1534 it saw the conclusion of a peace between Ferdinand I., king of the Romans, and Ulrich I., duke of WÃ¼rtemberg. The population in 1869 was 5057.
