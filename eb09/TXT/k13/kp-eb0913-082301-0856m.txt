KAHLÚR, also called Bilâspur, one of the petty hill states in the Punjab, India, lying between 31° 12' 30" and 31° 35' 45" N. lat., and between 76° 26' and 76° 58' E. long. The area is 448 square miles, and the estimated population 60,000. The principal products are opium and grain; woollen goods are manufactured. The estimated revenue is about .£10,000. The Gurkhâs overran the country in the early part of the century, and expelled the râjâ, who was, however, reinstated by the British in 1815.
