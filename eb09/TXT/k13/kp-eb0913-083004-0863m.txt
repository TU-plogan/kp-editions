KALW, or Calw, chief town of a circle in the government district of Schwarzwald, Würtemberg, is situated on the Nagold, about 34 miles south-west of Stuttgart by rail. It is the seat of local, civil, and criminal courts, and of a chamber of commerce; and it contains a high school, a commercial gymnasium, and a missionary institution. The industries include a large variety of spinning and weaving operations in wool and cotton. Carpets, cigars, and woolcombs are also manufactured. The timber trade, chiefly carried on with the Netherlands, is important. The prevalence of malaria renders the valley of the Nagold unhealthy. The population in 1875 was 4642.

The name of Kalw emerges as early as 1037. In the Middle Ages the town was under the dominion of an ancient and powerful family of counts, whose possessions finally passed to Würtemberg in 1345. In 1634 the town was taken by the Bavarians, and in 1692 by the French.
