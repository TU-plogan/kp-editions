KÁNARA, or Canara, North, the most southerly of the coast districts of Bombay, India, lying between 13° 52' and 15° 31' N. lat., and between 74° 10' and 75° 7' E. long., bounded on the N. by Belgaum, E. by Dhârwâr and Mysore, S. by South Kânara, W. by the Arabian sea and N. W. by the Portuguese territory of Goa, with an area of 4235 square miles. The chief town is Kârwâr. The main feature in the physical geography of the district is the Sahyâdri range of the Western Ghâts, which, running from north to south, divides it into two parts, a lowland or coast strip (Payanghât), and an upland plateau (Bâlâghât). The coast-line is only broken by the Kârwâr headland in the north, and by the estuaries of four rivers and the mouths of many smaller streams, through which the salt water finds an entrance into numerous lagoons winding several miles inland. The breadth of the lowlands varies from 5 to 15 miles. From this narrow belt rise a few smooth, flat-backed hills, from 200 to 300 feet high; and at places it is crossed by lofty, rugged, densely wooded spurs, which, starting from the main range of the Sahyâdri hills, maintain almost to the coast a height of not less than 1000 feet. Among these hills lie well-tilled valleys of garden and rice land. The plateau of the Bâlâghât is irregular, varying from 1500 to 2000 feet in height. In some parts the country rises into well-wooded knolls, in others it is studded by small, isolated, steep hills. Except on the banks of streams and in the more open glades, the whole is one broad waste of woodland and forest. The open spaces are dotted with hamlets or parcelled out into rice clearings.

Of the rivers flowing eastward from the watershed of the Sahyâdri hills the only one of importance is the Wardha, a tributary of the Tungabhadra. Of those that flow westwards, the four principal ones, proceeding from north to south, are the Kâli, Gungawâli, Tadri, and Sharavati. The last of these, plunging over a cliff 825 feet in height, about 35 miles from Honâwar town, forms the famous Gersoppa falls. The mineral products of the district consist of iron, limestone, and building stone. Extensive forests clothe the Sahyâdri hills, and are conserved under the rules of the forest department. During the ten years 1866-76 they yielded an average annual revenue of £39,307 to the state. Tigers, leopards, bears, deer, and wild hogs are numerous, and small game is plentiful. North Kânara formed part of Madras till 1861, when it was transferred to Bombay presidency.

The census of 1872 returned a population of 398,406 (206,417 males and 191,989 females), 94 to the square mile. The Hindus numbered 364,402; Mahometans, 21,755; Pârsis, 25; Christians, 12,189; and Jews, 34. The most noteworthy class among the Hindus are the Havik Brahmans, who make their livelihood from spice and areca nut gardens. Besides the regular Mahometan population (de-scenιlants[9:13:835] from Hindu converts to Islam), there are two special classes of foreign Mahometans,—the Navâyâtas or seamen, representatives of early colonies of Arab merchants, and the Sidis or descendants of African slaves formerly owned by the Portuguese. The Christians are nearly all Roman Catholics, a few families of whom are of Portuguese extraction, though much mixed by intermarriage with the natives; the remainder consist of local converts or their descendants.

The area under cultivation is returned at 333,175 acres, or about 12 per cent, of the total area. Rice forms the staple crop, but rdgi, sugar-cane, and safflower are also grown to a considerable extent; and cocoa-nuts, areca-nuts, cardamoms, and pepper are produced in gardens in large quantities for home consumption and for export. Cochineal is largely exported. Coffee is grown only to a small extent. Kârwâr, Kumpta, Ankola, Bhatkal, and Honâwar are the most important seaports. The total value of the trade at these in 1876 was £1,841,173, viz., £1,199,077 exports and £642,096 imports. Carving in sandal wood and ebony forms an important industrial art. Salt is largely manufactured under Government supervision. The total revenue of the district in 1876-77 was £165,597, of which the land tax yielded £82,862, and forests £34,281. There were, in 1875-76, 83 schools, attended by 4425 pupils. Fever of a severe type is the prevalent disease, and occasionally rages in an epidemic form. The average annual rainfall on the coast varies from 100 inches at Kârwâr to 163 at Kumpta ;. in the uplands it averages about 72 inches.
