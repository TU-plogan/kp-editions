KÁLABÁGH, or Kulabagh, a town in Bannu district, Punjab, India, in 32° 57' 57" N. lat., 71° 35' 37" E. long., picturesquely situated at the foot of the Salt Range, on the right bank of the Indus, where the river debouches from the hills, 105 miles below Attock. The houses nestle against the side of a precipitous hill of solid rock-salt, piled one upon another in successive· tiers, the roof of each tier forming the street which passes in front of the row immediately above, and a cliff, also of pure rock-salt, towers above the town. The salt is quarried (about 2700 tons in 1871-72) at Mâri, opposite the town, where it stands out in huge cliffs, practically inexhaustible. The similar outcrop at Kâlabâgh itself is not quarried. Alum also occurs in the neighbouring hills, and forms a considerable item of local trade. Iron implements are manufactured. Population in 1868, 6419.

K AL AMATA, chief town of the modern Greek nomarchy of Messenia in the Morea, is situated on the left bank of the Nedon, about a mile from the sea. There is a suburb on the right bank of the stream. On a hill behind the town are the ruins of a mediaeval castle; but no ancient Greek remains have been discovered, although modern travellers have identified the site with that of the classical Pharae or Pherae. It is the seat of a court of justice and of an archbishop. Kalamata is situated in a very fruitful district, of which it is the emporium. The roadsteads are safe in summer only; in the winter months the fishing craft take shelter in the haven of Armyro. The value of the chief exports in 1879 and 1880 was as follows :— currants, £111,750 and £109,200; figs, £112,730 and £87,186; olive oil, £21,340 and £12,789; silk, £34,230 and £31,215. The population in 1870 was 6327,

Pharae, Phene, or Pherβ was founded, according to Pau⅛anias, by Pharis, son of Hermes; and the antiquity of its origin is still further assured by its mention in the Iliad (v. 543, ix. 151), and the Odyssey (iii. 490, xvii. 186). When Messene was captured (182 b.c. ) by the Achaeans, Pharae became a distinct member of the Achaean league. During the Middle Ages it was for a time a fief of the Ville-hardouins. In 1685 Kalamata was captured by the Venetians; in 1770, and again in 1821, it was the revolutionary headquarters in the Morea. In 1825 it was sacked by Ibrahim Pasha.
