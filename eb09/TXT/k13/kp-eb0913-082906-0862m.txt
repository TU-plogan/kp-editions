KALOCSA, a town of Hungary, and capital of the former county of Soit (now included in the county of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kis-Kun), is situated in a marshy but highly productive district, 3 miles distant from a steam-packet station on the left bank of the Danube, and about 69 miles south of Budapest, 46° 31' N. lat., 18° 58' E. lung Kalocsa is the see of the second of the four Roman Catholio archbishops of Hungary, and has a fine cathedral, a seminary for priests, a Roman Catholic (Jesuit) gymnasium, an observatory, and an archiépiscopal palace (formerly a fortress) containing a library of 80,000 volumes and a botanical [9:13:830] collection. The inhabitants of Kalocsa and its wide-spreading communal lands are for the most part employed in the cultivation of the vine, fruit, flax, hemp, and cereals, in the capture of water-fowl, and in fishing. The population in 1880 amounted to 15,770, chiefly Magyars by nationality and Roman Catholics by creed.

Kalocsa is one of the oldest towns in Hungary. The present archbishopric is a development of a bishopric said to have been founded in the year 1000 by King Stephen the Saint. The town was once well fortified, and of far greater relative importance than at present. It suffered much during the 16th century from the desolating hordes of Ottomans who then ravaged the country. Kalocsa is much resorted to as an ecclesiastical centre.
