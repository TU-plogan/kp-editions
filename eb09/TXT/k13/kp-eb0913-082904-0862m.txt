KALITVENSKAYA, a stanitsa or camp-village in the country of the Don Cossacks, on the left bank of the Donetz, 81 miles east of Novotcherkassk. The name is well known in southern Russia through the excellent building material obtained from the sandstone quarries of the neighbourhood. The population increased from about 1500 in 1860 to 12,700 in 1872.
