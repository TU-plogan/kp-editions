KÁDÚR, or Cadoor, a district of Mysore state, southern India, lying between 13° 12' and 13° 58' N. lat., and between 75° 8' and 76° 25' E. long., with an area of 2294 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by Shimoga, on the E. by Chitaidrug, on the S. of Hassan,—all Mysore districts; on the W. the Western Ghâts separate it from the Bombay district of South Kânara.

The larger portion of the district consists of the Malnâd or hill country, which contains some of the wildest mountain scenery in southern India. The western frontier is formed by the chain of the Ghâts, of which the highest peaks are the Kuduremukh (6215 feet) and the Meruti Gudda (5451 feet). The centre of the district is occupied by the horseshoe range of the Bâba Budans, containing the loftiest mountain in Mysore, Mulaingiri, 6317 feet. The Maidân or plain country lying beneath the amphitheatre formed by the Bâba Budan hills is the most fertile portion of the district, well watered, and with the famous “black cotton soil.” The principal rivers are the Tunga and Bhadra, which rise near each other in the Ghâts, and unite to form the Tungabhadra, a tributary of the Kistna. The eastern portion of the district is watered by the Vedavati. At the point where this river leaves the Bâba Budan hills, it is embanked to form two extensive tanks, which irrigate the lower valley. From all the rivers water is drawn off into irrigation channels by means of anicuts or weirs. The chief natural wealth of Kâdur is in its forests, which contain inexhaustible supplies of the finest timber, especially teak, and also furnish shelter for the coffee plantations. Iron is found and smelted at the foot of the hills, and corundum exists in certain localities. Wild beasts and game are numerous, and fish are abundant.

The census of 1871 returned the population of the district at 332,381 (Hindus, 318,480; Mahometans, 12,017; Jains, 1316; Christians, 568). Only one town, Tarikere, contains over 5000 inhabitants, the population in 1871 being 5302. Chikmâgalûr, the headquarters of the district, has only 2027 inhabitants, and Kâdûr, the old civil station, only 2733. The staple crop of the district is rice, chiefly grown on the hill slopes, where the natural rainfall is sufficient, or in the river valleys, where the fields -can be irrigated from tanks and artificial canals. The principal unirrigated crop is rdgi (Cynosurus coracanus), which is preferred as food by the natives to rice, as affording more sustenance. The principal agricultural industry, however, is coffee cultivation. The berry is stated to have been first introduced by a Mahometan saint, Baba Budan, about two centuries ago, on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. European capital was not attracted to the enterprise till about 1840, but there are now 60,000 acres under coffee. The cocoa-nut and areca-nut palms flourish in the moist and sheltered valleys in the west. A Government cinchona plantation has also been established on the Baba Budan hills. The local manufactures include the production of cotton cloth, rough blankets, and sugar, as well as oil-pressing, spirit-distilling, and iron-smelting. The annual value of the district exportsis estimated at £297,000, and the imports at £217,000. The revenue of the district in 1873-74, excluding forests, education, and public works, was £94,316. Government aided and inspected schools numbered 176 in 1874, attended by 3027 pupils; unaided schools, 121, with 1235 pupils. The mean annual temperature at Chikmâgalûr, is about 78° F. During 1873 and 1874 the maximum recorded was 93°, and the lowest 69°. In the Malnâd the temperature falls much lower, and the cold at night in December and January is very sharp. The average rainfall at Chikmâgalûr during the four years ending 1874 was only 36 inches; while on certain coffee plantations on the Malnâd from 100 to 170 inches have been registered. Jungle or malarious fevers are prevalent in the Malnâd at certain seasons of the year, from which neither natives nor Europeans are exempt.

History.— As containing the hallowed sources of the Tungabhadra, Kâdûr district abounds with scenes associated with the legends of the Ràmdyana. Sringeri or Rishya-sringa-giri, on the Tunga river, takes precedence of all other places in its claims to mythical antiquity. Here, in historical times, was the home of Sankara Acharya, the great Sivaite reformer of the 8th century; and here at the present day resides the jagat-gunι or supreme high priest of the Smarfa'Brâhmans. The most ancient sites connected with local history* are the ruins of Ratnâpuri and of Sak-rây-patnâ, both of which are described as the capitals of powerful kings before the rise of the Ballâla dynasty. On the overthrow of the Ballâlas by the Mahometans, the Vijayanagar empire established itself over southern India; but the feudatory chiefs were practically independent. Subsequently the greater part of the district was overrun by the Ikkeri or Bednur pdlegdr from the neighbouring district of Hassan, who was in his turn defeated in 1694 by the conquering Hindu râjâs of Mysore. It was not until 1763 that Hyder Ali finally incorporated the whole country in the Mysore dominions. In 1799, after the death of Tipû, Kâdûr was restored to the Hindu kingdom then set up by the marquis of Wellesley. But in 1831 a general insurrection broke out, which overpowered the Mysore [9:13:816] Government, and necessitated the use of British troops before it was suppressed. The inquiry that followed led to the assumption of the direct administration of the entire state of Mysore by the British. This administration was continued till March 1881, when the state was again handed over to its native rulers, on the representative of the ruling family attaining his majority.
