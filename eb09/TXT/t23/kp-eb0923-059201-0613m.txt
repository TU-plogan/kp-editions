TRUMBULL, the surname of more than one individual of note in the literature, art, and politics of America.

1. Benjamin Trumbull was born at Hebron, Connecticut, on 19th December 1735, and died at North Haven, Connecticut, on 2d February 1820. He graduated at Yale in 1759, and entered the ministry. His literary work was considerable, the most important being the standard History of Connecticut to 1764.

2. John Trumbull was born at Waterbury, Connecticut, on 24th April 1750, and died at Detroit, Michigan, on 12th May 1831. He graduated at Yale in 1767, and became a lawyer and author of high reputation. His best work is M'Fingal, a Hudibrastic poem, intended to serve the Whig side in the American Revolution.

3. John Trumbull, son of the following, was born at Lebanon, Connecticut, on 6th June 1756, and died at New York City, on 10th November 1843. He graduated at Harvard in 1773, studied painting with Benjamin West in London, and left at his death a number of historical works. The earlier of these are the better; the later and larger were painted for the capitol at Washington.

4. Jonathan Trumbull was born at Lebanon, Connecticut, on 10th June 1710, and died at the same place on 17th August 1785. He graduated at Harvard in 1727, and became a lawyer and colonial politician. His place in American history was gained as governor of Connecticut from 1769 until 1783, through the whole period of the American Revolution. He was a trusted supporter and confidential adviser of Washington, who was accustomed to speak of him as “brother Jonathan,” and the term has since passed into popular use as equivalent to the people of the United States.

5. Jonathan Trumbull, son of the preceding, was born at Lebanon, Connecticut, on 26th March 1740, and died at the same place on 7th August 1809. He graduated at Harvard in 1759, and served as member of congress, 1789-95 (being speaker of the house of representatives during the last two years of his term), as United States senator, 1795-96, and as governor of Connecticut, 1798-1809.
