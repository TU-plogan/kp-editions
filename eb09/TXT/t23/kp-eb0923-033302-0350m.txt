THYME. The genus Thymus (nat. ord. Labiatae) comprises a number of fragrant aromatic undershrubs, with very small leaves and whorls of small lilac flowers in the axils of the leaves or at the ends of the branches. The common garden thyme, a native of the Mediterranean region, is Thymus vulgaris ; the wild thyme of our banks is T. Serpyllum. Marjoram {Origanum) is also closely allied. All these plants are remarkable for their essential oil, to which their fragrance is due. From this oil is produced by distillation a substance known as thymol, analogous to camphor. It is homologous with phenol or carbolic acid, and may be used as a disinfectant and germicide.
