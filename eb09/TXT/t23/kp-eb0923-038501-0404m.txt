TIFFIN, a city of the United States, in Seneca county (of which it is the county seat), Ohio, stands upon the Sandusky river, in 41° 7' N. lat., 83° 1Γ W. long., 42 miles south-east of Toledo. The city is situated in the midst of an agricultural region, for which it serves as a shipping and supply point, and has three railroads—the Baltimore and Ohio, the Indiana, Bloomington, and Western, and the North-Western Ohio. It is the seat of Heidelberg College, one of the minor educational institutions of the State. Tiffin had in 1880 a population of 7879, an increase of 2231 over that in 1870.
