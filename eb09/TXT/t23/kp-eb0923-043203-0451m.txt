TOKAT, a decayed provincial town of Turkey, in the vilayet of Sivas, and capital of the upper basin of the Iris (Yeschil Irmak), is a poorly-built place of about 10,000 inhabitants, in a hot, narrow valley, dominated by the ruins of a Byzantine castle, and surrounded by gardens watered by the Iris. It was once an important commercial station, and has still copper foundries. Six miles up the valley are the ruins of the Pontic Comana (q.v.).
