TULLE, a term restricted in England to a fine bobbin-net of silk, used for veils, scarves, millinery purposes, and trimmings of ladiesâ€™ dresses, &c. The French used the word to mean all machine-made lace the basis of which is the intertwisted net-work made on the bobbin-net machine. The word is derived from the town of Tulle in F rance (see above).
