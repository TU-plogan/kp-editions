TYPHON, or Typhoeus, son, according to Hesiod (Theog., 820 sq.), of the Earth and Tartarus, is described as a grisly monster with a hundred dragonsâ€™ heads who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus. According to Iliad ii. 282, he lies in the land of the Arimi (Cilicia). Other legends place his prison under Aetna or in other volcanic regions and make him the cause of eruptions. The myth, therefore, as we have it, rests on a personification of volcanic forces. He is the father of dangerous winds (typhoons), and by later writers is identified with the Egyptian Set (see vol. vii. p. 717).
