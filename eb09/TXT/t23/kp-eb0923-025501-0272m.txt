THEODORE, â€™ the name of two popes. Theodore I., pope from November 642 till May 649, succeeded John IV. He was the son of a bishop, and was born in Jerusalem. A zealous opponent of monothelitism, in the course of the protracted controversy he in a Roman synod excommunicated Pyrrhus, patriarch of Constantinople, and signed the document with ink mingled with consecrated wine. Theodore II. had a pontificate of only twenty days (Nov.-Dec. 897).
