TYLDESLEY with SHAKERLEY, a town of Lancashire, England, is situated on a considerable eminence, 11 miles west-north-west of Manchester and 199 north-west of London (by the London and North-Western Railway). The church of St George, a handsome building in the Early Pointed style, erected in 1827, has lately undergone restoration. Public baths were built in 1876. A public cemetery was formed in 1878. The town is the growth of the 19th century and depends upon its cotton-mills and the large collieries in the neighbourhood. It is governed by a local board of health of sixteen members. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 2490 acres) in 1871 was 6408 and in 1881 it was 9954.

At Domesday Tyldesley formed part of the manor of Warrington. One of its proprietors, Sir Thomas Tyldesley, was a distinguished Royalist. His son Edward in 1672 sold the manor to Ralph Astley, and from the Astleys it passed in 1728 to Thomas Johnson of Bolton. In 1823 it became the property of George Ormerod, author of the History of Cheshire.
