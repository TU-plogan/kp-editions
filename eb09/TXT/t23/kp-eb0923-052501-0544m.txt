TRAS-OS-MONTES (i.e. , “Behind the Mountains”) is the north-east frontier province of Portugal, situated on the other side of the Serra de Marão from Oporto. On the W. it is bounded by Entre Minho e Douro, and on the S. by Beira. The area is 4260 square miles, and the population increased from 393,279 in 1878 to 396,676 in 1881. Physically the province is a mountainous plateau, the most elevated in Portugal, and characterized by the picturesqueness and wildness of its scenery. Monte Zinho reaches a height of 7445 feet. Vast tracts are covered with heath; but in certain parts the soil is fertile, and the rich winegrowing district on the upper Douro (Alto Douro) is the native country of port. Silk-growing is also carried on; and wheat, rye, hemp, and flax appear among the exports. The province is divided into the two administrative districts of Villa Real and Braganza. Besides the two towns thus named, two only, Chaves and Miranda do Douro, are of any considerable size.
