TAMBOFF, capital of the above government, 300 miles distant from Moscow, is situated on the Tsna river, and on the railway from Kozloff to Saratoff. It is almost entirely built of wood, with broad unpaved streets, lined with low houses surrounded by gardens. It has a small public library, a theatre, and the few educational institutions which are usual in the chief towns of Russian provinces. Its manufactures are insignificant; and its trade, in local grain and in cattle purchased in the south and sent to Moscow, is far less important than that of Morshansk or Kozloff. The population in 1884 was 34,000.
