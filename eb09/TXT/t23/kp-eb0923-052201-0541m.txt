TRAPANI, a seaport of Italy, capital of the province of Trapani, and an episcopal see, lies on the extreme north-west coast of Sicily, 19 miles to the north-north-east of Marsala and 4 miles to the west-south-west of Monte St Giuliano. It lies on a sandy peninsula resembling a sickle (whence the name, from δρέπανον), projecting westward and concave towards the north. It is a place of considerable enterprise; the streets are,* comparatively speaking, regularly built and well kept; and the population are above the average in industry and intelligence. The town is still surrounded by a wall with bastions. Some of the mediaeval houses are interesting architecturally, but none of the public buildings require special notice. Among the institutions of Trapani may be mentioned the lyceum (with natural history collection and picture gallery), the gymnasium, the technical and navigation schools, and the library. Some of the churches contain choice works of art. The industries of the place include linen manufacture and works in coral, wood, iron, marble, alabaster, mother-of-pearl; there are also extensive salt lagoons in the immediate neighbourhood, and there is considerable traffic in salt, soda, sulphur, and grain. The harbour, on the south-west side of the sickle, is sheltered by a mole and protected by a fort in the islet of Colum-bara; it has a lighthouse at the entrance, and is accessible to vessels of about 400 tons. The population in 1881 was 32,020.

Trapani, the ancient Drepanum or Drepana, was the seaport of Eryx (see Eryx and Monte San Giuliano), and is represented by Virgil as the scene of the death of Anchises, and of the funeral games celebrated in his honour. Towards the beginning of the First Punic War (c . 260 B.C.) it was made a fortress by Hamilcar Barca, who removed hither the greater number of the inhabitants of Eryx, the remainder being transferred in 249. It fell into the hands of the Romans at the end of the war, and does not figure again in ancient history. It appears, however, to have continued to flourish as a commercial town, being mentioned both by Cicero and by Pliny. In the Middle Ages it became a royal residence.
