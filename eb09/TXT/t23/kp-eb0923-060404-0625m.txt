TUDELA, a city of Spain, in the province of Navarre, is situated on the right bank of the Ebro where it is joined by the Queyles, and on the railway from Zaragoza to Pamplona, about 50 miles to the north-west of the former city. The Ebro is here crossed by a fine old bridge, 400 yards in length, consisting of seventeen arches. The only building within the town of any interest is the fine church of Santa Maria, founded in 1135 and consecrated in 1188, the doorways and cloisters being specially rich in sculptural ornamentation. The manufactures of the place (cloth, silk, pottery) are unimportant. There is some trade in wine and oil. The population within the municipal boundaries in 1877 was 10,086.

Tudela, anciently Tutela, was the birthplace of the celebrated mediaeval traveller Benjamin ( q.v.) of Tudela. It was made an episcopal see in 1783, which was suppressed in 1851.
