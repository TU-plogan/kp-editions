TRINIDAD, a West Indian island, lying north-east of Venezuela, between 10° 3' and 10° 50' N. lat. and 61° 39' and 62°

W. long., being the most southern of the chain of islands separating the Atlantic from the Caribbean Sea. Its area is 1754 square miles, or nearly 1,123,000 acres. In shape the island is almost rectangular, but from its north-west and south-west corners project two long horns towards Venezuela, enclosing the Gulf of Paria. The north-west horn terminates in several islands, in one of the channels between which (the Boca Grande) lies the small British island of Patos. The general aspect of Trinidad is level. But three parallel ranges, varying from 600 to 3100 feet in height and clothed with forests, run from

The integral may also be obtained in the form yz - √l - y 2 √l - z 2 =√l - u 2 .

By means of the addition theorems and the values sin 1, cos =0 we can prove that sin (π / 2 + x) = cos x, cos (π/2 = - sin x ; and thence by another use of the addition theorems that sin (π + x ) = - sin x cos (π + x )= -cos x, from which the periodicity of the functions sin x, cos x follows.

We have also [ -ι log e (Vl - y 2 + ιf); J Vl- y 2 whence log e ( Vl - y 2 + if) + log e ( Vl - z 2 + tz)=a constant.

Therefore ( Vl - y 2 + q∕)(Vl -z 2 + tz) = Vl -u 2 + ιu, since u=y when z=0; whence we have the equation

east to west. The plains are watered by numerous streams, and the mountains are deeply furrowed by innumerable ravines. The rivers falling into the gulf are somewhat obstructed by shallows, especially the Caroni and the Couva. Geologically, as well as botanically and zoologically, Trinidad differs little from the adjacent mainland, with which at one time it probably was connected. The soil, which is fertile, consists of clay, loam, and alluvial deposits. The Moriche palm and mountain cabbage, as well as the cedar and the balata, are prominent objects. Poisonous and medicinal plants grow everywhere, and the woods contain an inexhaustible supply of timber. There are two mineral springs. The most curious natural feature of the island is the pitch lake^[1. This is vividly described by Charles Kingsley in At Last. ] in La Brea, 90 acres in extent, which furnishes an important export. The climate is healthy, the mean temperature being in January 76° Fahr. and in September 79°; it occasionally reaches 90°.

The population, which numbered 109,638 in 1871, was returned in 1881 at 153,128 (83,716 males and 69,412 females), and in 1885 at 171,914. Of these about 100,000 are natives of the island, principally of African race, 50,000 are coolies introduced from India (an industrious and prosperous element of the population), while the remainder includes the English and other European settlers. About 2000 coolies are introduced annually. Many French families from other parts of the West Indies settled in Trinidad many years ago, and traces of this and of the Spanish occupation are obvious in laws, municipal arrangements, language, and population. The two principal towns are Port of Spain and San Fernando. The former (34,000 inhabitants), the capital of the island, is built on a gently inclined plain near the north-east angle of the Gulf of Paria, [9:23:574] and is a fine and safe port. In the town there are two cathedrals (the Roman Catholic and the Anglican), and outside it a botanical garden. San Fernando, about 30 miles southward, with a population of 7000, is an important shipping place.

Of the total area about 300,000 acres are cultivated. The principal productions of the island are sugar and cocoa; coffee is also becoming important. Trinidad has suffered much from the effect of foreign state bounties, especially the export premiums of Germany and France. The sugar production in 1871 was 53,000 tons, in 1881 44,000 tons, and in 1885 64,000 tons. The principal exports in 1885 were—sugar, 64,000 tons (value £684,675); rum, 72,525 galls. (£7878); molasses, 2,416,761 galls. (£45,835); cocoa, 14,904,840 lbs. (£421,974); coffee, 20,270 lbs.; asphalt, 28,505 tons raw and 6731 tons boiled; cocoa-nuts, 9,645,700; bitters (Angostura and others) and liquors, 32,240 galls.; the total value was £2,246,664, including £707,421 specie and bullion. The imports in 1885 (including bullion and specie) were £2,241,478. Among the principal items are cottons, linens, woollens, and textiles generally (largely from the United Kingdom), £235,895; fish, flour, and provisions (principally from the United States), £270,000; lumber (from Canada), £43,075; rice (half from India), £113,940; hardware and machinery (principally from the United Kingdom), £116,894; gold (principally from Venezuela in transit), £651,398. The sailing vessels entering Trinidad ports in 1885 had a burden of 150,219 tons, the steamers a burden of 385,950 tons. The total public revenue in 1885 was £429,307, of which £240,444 was for customs and excise. The total expenditure was £443,920. There are 145 public schools, of which 61 are Government and 61 assisted, with a total attendance of 13,282 scholars. The principal towns are connected by railway lines.

Trinidad was discovered by Columbus on 31st July 1496. It remained in Spanish possession (although its principal town, San José de Oruña, was burnt by Sir Walter Raleigh in 1595) until 1797, when a British expedition from Martinique caused its capitulation, and it was finally ceded to Great Britain in 1802 by the treaty of Amiens. Its real starting-point as a productive country was in 1781, when the Madrid Government began to attract foreign immigrants. Trinidad is still strictly a crown colony of Great Britain. The legislative council includes the governor as president, and six official and eight unofficial members, all appointed by the crown. During the labour crisis caused by emancipation and the subsequent equalization of the British duties on free and slave-grown sugar, the colony was greatly assisted by the skilful administration of Lord Harris, governor from 1846 to 1851.
