TOUNG-NGÚ ), a district in the extreme north of the Tenasserim division of Burmah, with an area of 6354 square miles, and lying between 17° 37' and 19° 28' N. lat., and between 95° 53' and 96° 53' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Upper Burmah, on the E. by a high mountain range known as the “Great Watershed,” on the S. by Shwe-gyeng district, and on the W. by the Pegu Yomas. Three mountain ranges traverse the district—the Pegu Yomas, the Poung-loung, and the Nat-toung or “Great Watershed,”—all of which have a north and south direction, and are covered for the most part with dense forest. The Pegu Yomas have a general elevation of from 800 to 1200 feet, while the central range averages from 2000 to 3000 feet. The rest of Toung-ngú forms the upper portion of the valley of the Tsit-toung (Sittang) river, the only large river in the district, the chief tributaries of which are the Tshwa, Khaboung, Hpyu, Thouk-re-gat, and Rouk-thwa-wa, all being navigable for a great portion of their course. Limestone appears in various places, and in the north-east a light grey marble is quarried for lime. The rivers form the chief means of communication during the rainy season. Of late years some good roads have been constructed, and the Burmah State Railway, when completed, will intersect the district from south to north.

In 1881 the population numbered 128,848 (males 68,484, females 60,364), of whom 93,997 were Buddhists, 17,448 Christians, 2086 Hindus, 1962 Mohammedans, and 12,612 aborigines. The only town in the district is Toung-ngú on the Tsit-toung river in 18° 55' 24" N. lat. and 96° 31' 4" E. long., with a population of 17,199 in 1881. Of the total area only 59 square miles are actually under cultivation, owing mainly to the hilly nature of the country. Rice is the chief product; other crops include oil-seeds, sugarcane, cotton, fruit, and vegetables. The principal manufactures are silk, saltpetre, and gunpowder. In 1885-86 the gross value of the district was £15,098, of which the land produced £5880.
