TCHISTOPOL, a district town of Russia, in the government of Kazan, 90 miles to the south-east of that town, on the left bank of the Kama. Before 1781 it was a mere village (Tchistoye Pole), founded by runaway serfs; at present it is extending rapidly and becoming an industrial town, with flour-mills, distilleries, and a few cotton-mills. The merchants carry on a brisk trade in corn brought in from the fertile tracts of Ufa, and shipped down the Kama; manufactured wares are imported. The population in 1883 was 18,200.
