THEODOSIUS II. (401-450) succeeded his father Arcadius as emperor of the East in 408. During his minority the empire was ruled by the praetorian prefect Anthemius and Pulcheria, who became her brother’s guardian in 414. Under his sister’s care the young emperor was brought up rather as a virtuoso than a prince. The chief events of Theodosius’s reign are the wars with Persia in 421 and 441, the council of Ephesus (434), and the invasion of the Huns under Attila (441-448). In 450 Theodosius was thrown from his horse while hunting, and received injuries from which he died. He married Athenais, who on being baptized took the name of Eudocia. It was during his reign that the Codex Theodosianus, or collection of the constitutions of the Roman emperors, was formed. The idea took birth as early as 425, but was only put into execution between 435 and 438; in the latter year the Code was published.
