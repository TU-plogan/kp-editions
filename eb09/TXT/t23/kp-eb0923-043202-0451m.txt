TOGO-LAND, one of the portions of the African continent under the protection of the German empire. It forms part of the territory on the west coast formerly distinguished as the Slave Coast, and is bounded on the E. by Little Popo, on the S.W. by the British Gold Coast Colony, and on the N.W. by the still independent territory of the Anio tribes. The coast-line is only 22 miles in length, and with an area of about 500 square miles Togo-land is estimated to have a population of 40,000 souls. The great physical feature of the country is the Togo, Hakko, or Avon lagoon, which is cut off from the ocean by the narrow belt of sandy soil on which are situated Bagida, Porto Seguro, and Bay. The town of Togo lies on the east side of the Togo lagoon, where it extends eastward to Little Popo Lake. The lagoon is fed by a stream from the north, the Haho or Hakko, first discovered by John Duncan in 1846.

See Hugo Zoller, Tοgοland; Petermann , s Μittheilungen (1886); and Scott. Geogr. Mag. (1886), all of which give maps.
