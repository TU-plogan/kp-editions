TIPPERARY, a market town in the above county, is beautifully situated near the base of the Slieve-na-muck or Tipperary Hills, a branch of the Galtee range, on the Waterford and Limerick Railway, 3 miles south-east of Limerick junction and 110 south-west of Dublin. It contains a handsome Protestant church, a Catholic chapel, an endowed grammar-school, a town-hall, and a new com and butter market. Owing to its situation in the centre of a fine agricultural district, it enjoys considerable prosperity, and its butter market ranks next to that of Cork. The town is of great antiquity, but first acquired importance by the erection of a castle by King John, of which there are now no remains. A monastery founded for Augustinians by Henry III., which has also disappeared, gave a second impulse to its growth. Formerly it was a corporation from a grant made in 1310 by Edward IL, but is now governed by commissioners under provision of the Town Improvement Act of 1854. The population in 1871 was 6638, and in 1881 it was 7274.
