TIPPERAH, a district of British India, in the Chittagong division of the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, situated between 23° 0' and 24° 16' N. lat. and 90° 36' and 91° 39' E. long., with an area of 2491 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by Maimansinh and Sylhet, on the S. by Noákhálí, on the W. by the river Meghna, separating it from Maimansinh, Dacca, and Bákarganj, and on the E. by the state of Hill Tipperah. The district presents a continuous flat and open surface, with the exception of the isolated Lálmái range (100 feet), and is for the most part laid out in well-cultivated fields, intersected in all directions by rivers and lchals (creeks), which are partially affected by the tides. In the lowlands the soil is uniformly light and sandy; but in the higher parts a deep alluvial soil alternates with bands of clay and sand. The principal rivers are the Meghna, which is navigable throughout the year for boats of 4 tons burden, and the Gumti, Dákátiá, and Titás, which are also navigable for craft of 4 tons for a considerable portion of their course. There are many marshes or bhils. The principal road is the grand trunk (63 miles), which traverses the district from east to west. The wild animals include elephants, tigers, leopards, wild boars, jackals, and buffaloes. The climate is mild, agreeable, and healthy.

The population of the district in 1881 was 1,519,338 (males 770,893, females 748,445); of these Hindus numbered 511,025, Mohammedans 1,007,740, and Christians 199. There are only two towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants each, viz., Comillah (13,372) and Bráhmánbária (17,438). Comillah is the chief town of the district and is situated on the south bank of the Gumti, in 23° 28' N. lat. and 91° 14' E. long. Rice is the staple crop of the district; wheat and barley, Indian corn and millet, pease, gram, and several other pulses are also cultivated, as well as betel-leaf and betel-nut, sugar-cane, tobacco, &c. The chief exports are rice, jute, and betelnuts; and the principal imports sugar, timber, cotton goods, cocoa-nut oil, bamboos, spices, salt, tobacco, &c. In 1885-86 the net revenue of the district amounted to £181,481, the land-tax contributing £102,866. Tipperah came under the East India Company in 1765; but more than a fifth of its present area was under the immediate rule of the raja of Hill Tipperah, who paid a tribute of ivory and elephants. At that time Tipperah formed part of Jalál-pur; but in 1822 it was separated, and since then great changes have been made in its boundaries. With the exception of a serious raid in 1860 by the Kukís or Lusháis, nothing has disturbed the peace of the district.
