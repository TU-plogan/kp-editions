TELLICHERRI, a seaport town of India, in Malabar district of Madras, situated in 11° 44' 53" N. lat. and 75° 3Γ 38" E. long. It is a healthy and picturesque town, built upon a group of wooded hills running down to the sea, and is protected by a natural breakwater of rock. The town with its suburbs occupies about 5 square miles, and was at one time defended by a strong mud wall. The citadel or castle still stands to the north of the town. The East India Company established a factory here in 1683 for the pepper and cardamom trade. For two years (1780-82) the town withstood a siege by Hyder’s general Sardâr Khàn, and in the subsequent wars with Mysore Tellicherri was the base of operations for the ascent of the Ghâts from the west coast. In 1881 the population was 26,410.
