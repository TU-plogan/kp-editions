TRIPOLITZA, officially Tripolis, a town of Greece, capital of the nomarchy of Arcadia, is situated in a plain 3000 feet above sea-level, 22 miles south-west of Argos. The name has reference to the three ancient cities of Mantinea, Pallantium, and Tegea, of which Tripolitza is the modern representative. Before the war of independence it was the capital of the Morea and the seat of a pasha, with about 20,000 inhabitants; but in 1821 it was taken and sacked by the insurgents, and in 1825 its ruin was completed by Ibrahim Pasha. The town has since been rebuilt, and now (1887) contains about 10,000 inhabitants.
