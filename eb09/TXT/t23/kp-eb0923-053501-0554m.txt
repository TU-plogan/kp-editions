TREGELLES, Samuel Prideaux (1813—1875), New Testament scholar, was born at Wodehouse Place, near Falmouth, on January 30, 1813. His parents were Quakers, and he himself for many years was in communion with the (Darbyite) Plymouth Brethren, but latterly he became a member of the Church of England. He was educated at Falmouth grammar school, and afterwards, without having attended any university, held various modest educational appointments, but finally devoted himself entirely to a laborious student life, until he was incapacitated for literary work by paralysis in 1870. He died at Plymouth on April 24, 1875.

Most of his numerous publications had reference to his great critical edition of the New Testament (see Bible, vol. iii. p. 648). They include an Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament (1854), a new edition of Horne’s Introduction (1860), and Canon Muratorianus: Earliest Catalogue of Books of the New Testament (186S). As early as 1844 he published an edition of the Apocalypse, with the Greek text so revised as to rest almost entirely upon ancient evidence. Tregelles wrote Heads of Hebrew Grammar (1852), translated Gesenius’s Hebrew Lexicon, and was the author of a little work on the Jansenists (1851) and of various works in exposition of his special eschatological views (Remarks on the Prophetic Visions of Daniel, 1852, new ed. 1864).
