TUCUMAN, or, more fully, San Miguel de Tucuman, capital of the province of Tucuman, in the Argentine Republic, is a straggling town, on the right bank of the Tala (a subtributary of the Rio Salado), at the eastern base of the Sierra de Aconquija, in 26° 50' S. lat. and 64° 35' W. long. It is connected by rail with Cordova and Rosario. The surrounding district is fertile, and also produces excellent timber. Leather and sugar are the principal objects of industry. The population was recently estimated at 17,000.
