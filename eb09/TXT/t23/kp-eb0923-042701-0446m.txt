TOBAGO, the most southerly of the Windward group of British West Indian Islands (11° 9' N. lat., 60° 12' W. long.), 20 miles north-east from Trinidad, is 26 miles in length and 7^ at its greatest breadth, with an area of 114 square miles (73,313 acres). Its formation is volcanic, and the physical aspect irregular and picturesque, with conical hills and ridges; the main ridge is 1800 feet high and 18 miles long. There are several excellent harbours. The products are sugar, rum, molasses, and fruits of various kinds, only the low ground being cultivated; production is not increasing. In 1885 the revenue was £10,826 and the expenditure £12,031, while the imports were £30,758 and the exports £26,414. The population in 1885 was 19,363 (9368 males and 9995 females), principally of African race, the whites being very few. Tobago has a small legislative council and an administrator under the Government of the Windward Islands. Its capital is Scarborough (1200 inhabitants), on the south-east coast.

Tobago was discovered by Columbus in 1498, and the British flag was first planted iu 1580, the island being then occupied by Caribs. It has subsequently been held by the Dutch and the French, but ultimately was ceded to the British crown in 1814.
