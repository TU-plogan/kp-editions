TIDOR, or Tidore, an island (0° 39' N. lat. and 127° 23' E. long.) of the East Indian Archipelago, off the west coast of Jilolo (<7.v.) and south of Ternate, is nearly circular in form, and has an area of about 58 square miles. A volcano (5900 feet), now quiescent, rises in the centre and occupies nearly the whole of the island; its sides are densely covered with forests. The principal productions are sago, rice, cocoa-nuts, and bananas. The capital, Tidor, on the east coast, is a walled town and the seat of a sultan tributary to the Dutch. The population is estimated at 7500. Tidor, which is included in the residency of Ternate, is administered by a “controleur.”
