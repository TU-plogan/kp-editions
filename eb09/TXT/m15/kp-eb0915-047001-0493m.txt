MANDALAY, the capital of Independent Burmah, is situated about 2 miles from the left bank of the Irawadi river, in 21° 59' N. lat. and 96° 8' E. long. It was founded by the king of Burmah, who transferred to it the seat of government from Amarapura in 1860. The city proper is laid out in a square, each side of which is a little over a mile in length. It is enclosed by a crenel- [9:15:471] ’ lated brick wall 26 feet high and 3 feet thick; the twelve .gates (three on each side) are surmounted with wooden watch-towers. A deep wet moat, 100 feet broad, with its escarp 60 feet from the walls, extends along all four sides; it is crossed by five bridges. The palace of the king occupies the central space of the city; the walls of its enclosure are laid symmetrically with those of the city, and each face is about 370 yards in length. The outer fence consists of a stockade of teak-wood posts 20 feet high, and within it are three successive enclosures, bounded by brick walls. The palace is built within the inner enclosure; and its front, which faces the east, contains the great hall of audience, 260 feet long, composed of teak timber, elaborately carved and gilded, erected on a terrace of brickwork 10 feet high. It is in the form of a colonnade, the central part running back, forming a nave with two side aisles. At the extremity of this nave is a space like a chancel (said to be the exact centre of the city) where stands the throne, over which rises a graceful gilded spire, visible from all parts of the city and surrounding country. Another feature of the complex palace buildings is the lofty campanile. Around the palace walls a wide space has been laid out as an esplanade, on the further margin of which are situated most of the houses of the princes, ministers of state, and court officials. The city may be said to consist of two parts, intramural and extramural; the streets in the former run parallel with the walls, dividing the building sites into rectangular blocks. The majority of the houses are constructed of bamboos and bamboo matting, slightly raised from the ground on posts, with here and there a few brick and wooden buildings. The streets inside the city are very wide, the principal ones being lined with tamarind trees. In the suburbs the roads are laid out with something of the same regularity as in the city, but are of less width, with the exception of the principal road, the Kuladan or foreign quarter, inhabited chiefly by Armenians, Mughals, and the few European residents. The number of houses in the city and suburbs is said to be, in round numbers, 12,000; and the population is roughly estimated at 65,000. Monasteries and pagodas are dotted about in open spaces, both within and without the walls. Silkweaving is the principal manufacture.
