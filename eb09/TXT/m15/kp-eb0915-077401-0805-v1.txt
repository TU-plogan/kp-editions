MECHITHARISTS, a congregation of Armenian monks, in communion with the church of Rome, which has enjoyed papal recognition since 1712. Its founder Mechithar, or Mechitar da Pietro, a native of Sebaste (Sivas) in Armenia, was born on February 7, 1676; his original name was Manuk, which he exchanged for that by which he was subsequently known (“Comforter ”) when he entered the cloister of the Holy Cross in his native town. In the pursuit of knowledge he visited various seats of learning in Armenia, and in the years 1691, 1696, and 1699 respectively he attained the office of deacon, priest, and vartabed or doctor in theology. Having removed to Constantinople, he founded there in 1701 a religious institute for the intellectual, moral, and spiritual elevation of his countrymen, and for the cultivation of their language and literature. In 1703 sectarian jealousy obliged him to retire to the Morea, where he ultimately found a settlement at Modon, and built a cloister and church (1706-8). The outbreak of hostilities between the Turks and Venetians in 1715 compelled him to take refuge in Venice, where in 1717 he received from the senate the island of San Lazzaro, which ever since has been the home of his order. Mechithar, who died on April 27,1749, was the author of a Grammatica Armena, printed in 1770, of an Armenian Lexicon, printed in 1744, of an Armenian translation of the Bible, printed in 1734, and of several commentaries on Biblical books. The order of Mechitharists, which, as already mentioned, received formal recognition (from Clement XI.) in 1712, uses the Armenian language and the Syrian rite'; its rule resembles the Benedictine, prominent among the duties of its members being the proclamation of the gospel and the diffusion of good literature. They have accumulated at San Lazzaro a large library, specially rich in Armenian MSS.; and their linguistic attainments are considerable. Among their services to the cause of learning may be mentioned, in addition to the preparation of critical texts of the Armenian classics and of the Armenian version of the Bible, the publication in old translations of various works of Ephraem Syrus, Philo, and Eusebius, of which the originals have been lost. There are establishments belonging to the order elsewhere in Italy (Padua), as well as in Russia and Turkey, in Paris, in Austria-Hungary, and in Germany. Of these the most important is that of Vienna, which has existed since 1810, and has become a sort of learned “academy,” receiving honorary members even from beyond the pale of the Roman Catholic Church.
