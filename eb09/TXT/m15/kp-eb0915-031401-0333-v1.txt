MALACHITE, an ore of copper, presenting in its finer varieties a beautiful green colour which has led to its use as an ornamental stone. It is chemically a hydrated basic carbonate of copper, and appears to have been formed in most cases by the action of meteoric agencies on native copper, red oxide of copper, copper pyrites, and other ores. Upon these minerals the malachite frequently forms an incrustation. Although occasionally found in crystals belonging to the monoclinic system, its usual mode of occurrence is in stalactiticand stalagmitic forms,—frequently with a globular, botryoidal, or mammillated surface; while in other cases it forms compact and even earthy masses. The stalagmitic varieties display, when fractured, a beautiful internal structure, being made up of concentric zones of light and dark tints; and it is upon this structure that much of the beauty of polished malachite depends. The colours include various shades of apple-green, emeraldgreen[9:15:315], and verdigris-green. Certain varieties of the mineral exhibit, when fractured, a finely fibrous texture and soft silky lustre. The name malachite is derived from μαλαχή (the mallow), in allusion to the resemblance of the colour of the mineral to that of mallow leaves. Malachite was probably one of the green minerals described by Theophrastus under the general name of σ∕χαpαγδos, or emerald. It is believed to have been the smaragdτιs medicus of Pliny, while the molochitis of that author does not appear to have represented our modern malachite. Malachite is a mineral of very wide geographical distribution, being found more or less abundantly in the upper part of most deposits of copper ore. The finer varieties, such as lend themselves to purposes of ornament, are, however, found only in »Siberia, in Australia, and at Bembe on the west coast of Africa. Probably the finest deposits in the world were those discovered some years ago in Prince Demidoff’s mines at Nijni Tagilsk, in the government of Ekaterinburg, on the Siberian side of the Ural mountains. The mineral is highly prized in Russia for use in mosaic work, and for the manufacture of vases, snuff-boxes, and other small ornaments. Magnificent examples of malachite work, in the shape of mantelpieces, folding doors, tables, chairs, and other articles of furniture, have occasionally been executed. Such objects are veneered with thin slabs of malachite ingeniously fitted together so as to preserve the pattern, and having the interspaces between the component pieces filled up with a cement formed of small fragments of the malachite itself. The mineral is sawn into slabs, ground smooth with emery, and finally polished with tripoli. Although its degree of hardness is only from 3 ’ 5 to 4, it takes an excellent polish. It is rather denser than marble, its specific gravity being 3 , 7 to 4; but it is much more difficult to work, in consequence of its tendency to break along the planes of deposition. Malachite is occasionally used for cameo-work, but not with great success; some fine antique cameos in malachite are, however, known. The mineral has also been ground to powder, and used as a pigment under the name of mountaingreen. The coarser masses are extensively used as ores of copper, malachite containing about 57 per cent, of metal. The mineral called azurite or chessylite, a hydrated basic carbonate of copper closely resembling malachite, save in colour, is occasionally known as blue malachite.
