MAXIMUS, the name of four Roman emperors. In chronological order the first was Μ. Clodius Pupienus Maximus, who was associated with Balbinus in the imperial dignity by the senate for a short time in 238, before and after the death of the hated Maximin. Tho second was Magnus Clemens Maximus, a native of Spain, who shared the imperial dignity with Valentinian and Theodosius from 383 to 388. He had accompanied Theodosius on several expeditions, and from 368 held high military rank in Britain. The disaffection of the Roman troops towards the emperor Gratian found expression in 383 in the proclamation of Maximus as emperor, —whether with or without his complicity in the act is uncertain. Voluntarily or under compulsion Maximus forthwith attacked Gratian in Gaul, and drove him from Paris to Lyons, where the fugitive was murdered. Circumstances made it difficult for Theodosius at the time to avenge the death of his colleague by war, and an agreement was therefore come to by which Maximus was recognized as Augustus and sole emperor in Gaul, Spain, and Britain, while Valentinian was to remain unmolested in Italy and Illyricum, Theodosius retaining his sovereignty in the East. A prosperous reign of four years having tempted Maximus, in 387, to pass the Alps, Valentinian was speedily put to flight, while the invader established himself in Milan, and for the time became master of Italy. Theodosius now took vigorous measures: advancing a powerful army by land, he utterly defeated the western, troops at Siscia (Sciszek) in Pannonia, and, passing the Julian Alps with great rapidity, came upon Maximus, who had fled to Aquileia, seized him, and caused him to be beheaded (August 388). The third, Maximus Tyrannus, was made emperor in Spain by the Roman general Gerontius, [9:15:646] who had rebelled against Constantine in 408. Alter the defeat of Gerontius at Arles, and his subsequent death in 411, Maximus renounced the imperial title and was permitted by Constantine to retire into private life. About 418 he rebelled again, but, failing in his attempt, was seized, carried into Italy, and put to death at Ravenna in 422. Lastly, Petronius Maximus was a member of the higher Roman nobility, and had held a large number of public offices, including those of praefectus Romae (420) and of praefectus Italiae (439-441 and 445). He was one of the intimate associates of Valentinian, who received his assistance in the palace intrigues which led to the death of Aetius in 454; but a brutal outrage committed on the wife of Maximus by the emperor turned his friendship into the bitterest hatred. Maximus was proclaimed emperor immediately after Valentinian’s murder in March 455, but reigned for less than three months, having been murdered by some Burgundian mercenaries as he was flying before the Vandals, who, invited by Eudoxia, the widow of Valentinian, had landed at the mouth of the Tiber (May or June 455).
