MADDALONI, a city of Italy, in the province of Caserta (Terra di Lavoro), about 3∣ miles south-east of Caserta, with a station both on the railway from Caserta to Benevento and on that from Caserta to Avellino. It is prettily situated at the base of one of the Tiffata hills, the towers of its mediaeval castle and the church of San Michele crowning the heights above. The fine old palace of the Caraffas, once dukes of Maddaloni, the old college now named after Giordano Bruno, and the institute for the sons of soldiers (dating from 1859, and accommodating 500 pupils) are the chief points of interest. In 1871 the population was 18,767. About 2∣ miles to the east, at Valle di Maddaloni, the Caroline aqueduct (so called after Charles IV. of Naples), conveying the water of the Tiburno to Caserta (a distance of 19 miles), is carried across the valley between Monte Longano and Monte Gargano by a threefold series of noble arches rising to a height of 178 feet. The work was designed by Lodovico Vanvitelli, and constructed between 1753 and 1759.

Maddaloni (in mediaeval documents Matalonum, Madalonum, and Magdalonum') lies on the Appian Way, and is doubtfully identified with Sessuela. Its castle and walls are probably of Lombard origin. The first count of Maddaloni was invested with the fief in 1465, the first duke in 1558. In 1860 General Bixio’s volunteers beat the royal Neapolitan forces at Maddaloni. See A. de Reumont, The Carafas of Maddaloni, Bohn’s series, 1854.
