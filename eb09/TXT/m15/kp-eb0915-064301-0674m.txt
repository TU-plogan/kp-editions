MAUSOLUS, or according to his coins Maussolus (Mαυσσωλos), a king of Caria, whose reign probably began in 377 and terminated with his death in 353 b.c. The part he took in the revolt against Artaxerxes Memnon, his conquest of Lydia, Ionia, and several of the Greek islands along the coast, his co operation with the Rhodians and their allies in the war against Athens, and the removal of his capital from Mylasa, the ancient seat of the Carian kings, to the city of Halicarnassus are the leading facts of his history. He is best known, however, from the tomb erected for him by his widow Artemisia with such cultured magnificence that the name of mausoleum has become the generic title of all similar’ monuments. One of the most curious of the inscriptions discovered at Mylasa details the punishment of certain conspirators who had attempted the life of Mausolus when he was attending a festival in a temple at Lab ran da. See Halicarnassus.
