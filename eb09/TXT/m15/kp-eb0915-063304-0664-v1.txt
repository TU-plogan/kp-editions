MATTHEW (Mα00ouos or Ματθαίο?, i.e., 'ΦP, a shortened form of Mattaniah or Mattithiah, equivalent to Theodorus; comp. vol. xi. p. 370), one of the twelve apostles of Jesus Christ, and, according to tradition, the author of the First Gospel. In its full Hebrew form the name occurs several times in the Old Testament, being borne by more than one person of priestly or Levitical family. Matthew, in the Gospel which bears his name, is described as having been a tax gatherer (τελώνες, Matt. x. 3), and the circumstances of his call to become a follower of Jesus, which he received as he sat at the “receipt of custom” or “tax office” in one of the towns by the Sea of Galilee, are briefly related in chap. ix. 9. It has sometimes been doubted, but without any good reason, whether the precisely parallel narrative relating to “Levi the son of Alphaeus” (Mark. ii. 14; Luke v. 27, 28) has reference to the same person (compare the double names Simon and Peter, Joses and Barnabas, and others). In the lists of the names of the apostles given in the synoptical Gospels and in the Acts, Matthew ranks third or fourth in the second group of four. Little is recorded of him except the feast which he gave in his house at the beginning of his discipleship; the way in which this is related seems to indicate that he was (comparatively at least) a wealthy man. He was also present in “the upper room” at Jerusalem after the ascension, when Matthias was elected to be the successor of Judas. Tradition has nothing trustworthy to tell about his subsequent career, but there is nothing inherently improbable in the allegation of Eusebius (77. E., iii. 24) that he spent several years in Jerusalem preaching to the Hebrews (and writing the Gospel which bears his name), or that he afterwards extended his missionary activities in other directions. Socrates (7/. E., i. 19) speaks of him as having carried the gospel to Ethiopia; the earlier legends, however, embodied in the apocryphal Acta Andreae et Matthaei and Acta et Martyrium Matthaei, unanimously point to the regions bordering on the Black Sea (“Pontus” and the land of the Anthropophagi) as having been the scene of his labours^ (see the article of Lipsius on the “Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles” in Smith’s Diet, of Christ. Biog.; also his Aρokr. Apostel g e$ch., 1883). According to the Gnostic Heracleon, whose statement is quoted and apparently homologated by Clement of Alexandria (Strom. iv. 9), Matthew died a natural death. He is commemorated as a martyr by the Greek Church on November 16, and by the Roman on September 21, the scene of his martyrdom being placed by the Breviary in “Ethiopia”; the same authority affirms that his body was afterwards translated to Salerno, where it now lies in the church built by Robert Guiscard. In Christian art (following Jerome) he is generally regarded as symbolized by the “man” in Ezek. i. 10, Rev. iv. 7.
