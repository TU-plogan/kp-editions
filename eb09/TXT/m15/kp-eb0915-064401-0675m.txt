MAXIMIANUS, Marcus Aurelius Valerius, surnamed Πerculius, Roman emperor from 286 to 305, and again in a doubtful manner for some time prior to 308, was by birth a Pannonian peasant, but achieved great distinction in the course of long service in the army in almost every quarter of the empire, and, having been made Caesar by Diocletian in 285, received the title of Augustus in the following year (April 1, 286) with the honorary appellation of Herculius. In 287 he suppressed the rising of the peasants (Bagaudae) in Gaul, but in 289, after a three years’ struggle, his colleague and he were compelled to acquiesce in the assumption by his lieutenant Carausius of the title of Augustus in Britain. After 292, Maximian left the care of the Rhine frontier to Constantius Chlorus, who had been designated Caesar in that year, but in 297 ids arms achieved a rapid and decisive victory over the barbarians of Mauretania, and in November 303 he shared at Rome the triumph of Diocletian, the last pageant of the kind ever witnessed by that city. On May 1, 305, the day of Diocletian’s abdication, he also, but without his colleague’s sincerity, divested himself of the imperial dignity at Milan, which had been his capital, and retired to a villa in Lucania; in the following year, however, he was induced by his son Maxentius to reassume the purple. In 307 he brought the emperor Severus a captive to Rome, and also compelled the retreat of Galerius, but in 308 he was himself driven by Maxentius from Italy into Illyricum, whence again he was compelled to seek refuge at Arles, the court of his son-in-law Constantine. Here a false report was received, or invented, of the death of Constantine, at that time absent on the Rhine, and Maximian at once grasped at the succession, but was soon driven to Marseilles, where, having been delivered up to his pursuers, he strangled himself in 310 (February).
