MARMONTEL, Jean François (1723-1799), one of the most distinguished men of letters in Paris during the latter half of the 18th century, was born of poor parents in Limousin, on the 11th July 1723. After studying with the Jesuits at Mauriac, he taught in their colleges at Clermont and Toulouse; and in 1745, acting on the advice of Voltaire, he set out for Paris to try for literary honours. From 1748 to 1753 he wrote a succession of tragedies which,^[1. Denys le Tyran, 1748; Aristomène, 1749 ; Cléopâtre, 1750; Héraclides, 1752; Egyptus, 1753. ] though for the most part considered prolix and artificial by modern readers, had great success on the stage, and secured to Voltaire’s new disciple a good position in literary and fashionable circles. Being now associated with Diderot and D’Alembert, he wrote for the great Encyclopédie a series of articles evincing considerable critical power and insight, which in their collected form, under the title Éléments de Littérature, still rank among the higher French classics. He also wrote several comic operas, the two best of which probably are Sylvain and Zémire et Azore. In 1758 he gained the patronage of Madame Pompadour, and was soon after appointed manager of thθ official journal Le Mercure, in which he had already commenced a series of elegant and attractive tales. These were the Contes Moraux, on which, according to some critics, Marmontel’s literary reputation mainly rests. Their merit lies partly in the literary style, which in delicate finish frequently rivals that of his master Voltaire, but mainly in their graphic and charming pictures of

French society under Louis XV. After being elected to the French Academy, in 1763, he appears to have been ambitious to create a new literary style, exemplified notably in his dull prose-epic romance Bélisaire, now remarkable only on account of a chapter on religious toleration which incurred the censure of the Sorbonne and the archbishop of Paris. Marmontel retorted in Les Incas, by tracing the cruelties in Spanish America to the religious fanaticism of the Roman Catholic invaders.

After being appointed historiographer of France, secretary to the Academy (1783), and professor of history in the Lycée (1786), Marmontel in 1788 wrote a history of the regency, which is of little value. To compensate for this, however, he in 1795 began his Mémoires, the most interesting and valuable if not the greatest of his works, being a picturesque review of his whole life, a literary history of two important reigns, a great gallery of portraits extending from the venerable Massillon, whom more than half a century previously he had seen at Clermont, to the fiery Mirabeau amidst the tempestuous first years of the French Revolution. Reduced to. poverty by the Revolution, Marmontel in 1792 retired from the Reign of Terror to Evreux, and soon after to a cottage near Gaillon, in the department of Eure. To that retreat we owe the Mémoires, and there, after a short stay in Paris when elected in 1797 to the Conseil des Anciens, he died on the 31st December 1799.
