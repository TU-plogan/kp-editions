+====================================================================+


MAITLAND, Sir Richard (1496-1586), an early Scottish lawyer and poet, was born in 1496. His father, William Maitland of Lethington and Thirlstane, fell at Flodden; his mother was a daughter of George, Lord Seton. He studied law at the university of St Andrews, and afterwards in France. He was in 1552 one of the commissioners to settle matters with the English about the debatable lands on the borders, and about that time had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him. In 1554 he was made an extraordinary lord of session. About 1561 he seems to have lost his sight, but this did not render him incapable of attending to public business, as he was the same year admitted an ordinary lord of session by the title of Lethington, and in 1562 was nominated lord privy seal. He resigned this latter office in 1567, in favour of John, prior of Coldingham, his second son, but he sat on the bench till he attained his eighty-eighth year. He was an amiable and accomplished man, and died in 1586, aged ninety, after having been employed in public offices for upwards of seventy years. His eldest son, William, forms the subject of next article. His second son, John, was a lord of session, and was made a lord of parliament in 1590, by the title. of Lord Maitland of Thirlstane, in which he was succeeded by his son John, also for some time a lord of session, who was created earl of Lauderdale in 1624. The latter was the father of John Maitland, duke of Lauderdale, noticed above. One of Sir Richard’s daughters, Mary, assisted her father in his studies, and also wrote verses.

The poems of Sir Richard Maitland, none of them lengthy, are somewhat satirical, and are principally directed against the abuses of his time. He must, however, be regarded as the industrious collector and preserver of many pieces of ancient Scottish poetry. These were copied into two large volumes, one in folio and another in quarto, the former written by himself, and the latter by his daughter. After being in the possession of his descendant the duke of Lauderdale, these volumes were purchased at the sale of the duke’s library by the celebrated Samuel Pepys, who was one of the first collectors of rare books in England. They have since been preserved in the Pepysian Library, Magdalene College, Cambridge. They lay there unnoticed for many years till Bishop Percy published one of the poems in his Reliques of English, Poetry. Several of the pieces were then transcribed by John Pinkerton, who afterwards published them under the title of Ancient Scottish Poems, comprising Pieces written from about 1420 till 1586, with Notesand a Glossary, 2 vols. 8vo, London, 1786. Sir ⅛ichard left in manuscript a history of the family of Seton, and a volume of legal decisions collected by him between the years 1550 and 1565. Both are preserved in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh, and the latter work is still unpublished. The Poems of Sir Richard Maitland were printed in 1830 by the Maitland Club, a literary society, founded in Glasgow in 1828, which took its name from him. The MS. used for the purpose was one preserved in the Drummond collection in the library of the university of Edinburgh. It seems to have been written shortly before the year 1627, when it was presented by Drummond to the library. In 1829 there was also printed for the club The History of the House of Seytoun to the year 1559, with a continuation to 1687 by Alexander, Viscount Kingston.
