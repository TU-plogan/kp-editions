MELVILL VAN CARNBEE, Pieter, Baron, an eminent Dutch geographer, was born at the Hague 20th May 1816, and died October 24, 1856. He traced his descent from an old Scotch family, originally it is said of Hungarian extraction. Destined for the navy, in which his grandfather had won distinction, Melvill imbibed a taste for hydrography and cartography as a student under Pilaar in the college of Medemblik, and he showed his capacity as a surveyor on his very first voyage to the Dutch Indies (1835). In,1839 he wasagainin the East, and was now attached to the hydrographical bureau at Batavia. With the assistance of the long-neglected documents collected by the old company, he completed in wonderfully short time his first great hydrographical work—a map of Java in five sheets, accompanied by sailing directions (Amsterdam, 1842; 2d revised edition, 1849),—which was received with great applause. Melvill remained in India till 1845 collecting materials for his second great hydrographical work, the chart of the waters between Sumatra and Borneo (two sheets, 1845 and 1846, revised edition of first sheet 1847; compare the descriptive memoir in Tindal and [9:15:845] Swart’s Journal, 1846∖ On his return to Holland Melvill was attached to the naval department with the special charge of studying the history of the hydrography of the Dutch Indies. He also undertook, in connexion with Von Siebold, the publication of the Moniteur des Indes, a valuable series of scientific papers, mainly from his own pen, on the foreign possessions of Holland, which was continued for three years. In 1850 Melvill returned to India as lieutenant of the first class and adjutant to Vice-Admiral Van den Bosch; and after the premature death of this commander he was again appointed keeper of the charts at Batavia. He was one of the founders and for a time the president of the new society for natural science (1850). In 1853 he obtained exemption from active naval service that he might devote himself to a general atlas of the Dutch Indies; and under the most unfavourable circumstances he prosecuted the task with incredible energy. But he was not to see its completion. Just after he had lost his young wife and new-born son he was called in 185G to be director of the marine establishment of Onrust; 'and there he soon fell a victim to climate, dying after much suffering in the hospital of Weltevreden, only forty years of age. In spite of delays caused by the engraving of the maps in Holland, no fewer than twenty-five sheets were already finished, but it was not till 1862 that the whole plan, embracing sixty sheets, was ably brought to a close by Lieutenant-Colonel W. F. Versteeg. The premature loss of Melvill was severely felt not only in Holland but in foreign countries, where, as shown by his connexion with the geographical societies of Paris, London, Berlin, and Bergen, his labours were highly esteemed. His industry and energy were equalled only by the benevolence and warmth of his heart. In 1843 he received the decoration of the Netherlands Lion, in 1849 that of the Legion of Honour.
