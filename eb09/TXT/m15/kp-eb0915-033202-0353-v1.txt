MALEBRANCHE, Nicolas (1638-1715), a well-known 4isciple of Descartes, was the youngest child of Nicolas Malebranche, secretary to Louis XIII., and Catherine de Lauzon, sister of a viceroy of Canada, and was born at Paris on August 6, 1638. Of an extremely feeble constitution mid somewhat deformed habit of body, he received his elementary education in Latin and Greek from a domestic tutor, and only left home when sufficiently advanced to enter upon a course of philosophy at the Collège de la Marche, and subsequently to study theology at the Sorbonne. He had resolved to enter the church, but his retiring and studious disposition led him to decline a stall in Notre Dame, and in 1660 he joined the Congregation of the Oratory. Both his ecclesiastical superiors and himself appear to have experienced considerable difficulty for some time in ascertaining what his special talents were, if they existed at all. He was first advised by Père Lecomte to devote himself to ecclesiastical history, and he accordingly set about a laborious perusal of the works of Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, but it was found that “the facts refused to arrange themselves in his mind, and mutually effaced one another.” Afterwards Richard Simon undertook to teach him Hebrew and Biblical criticism, but with no better success. At last having accidentally, in 1664, fallen upon one of the works of Descartes (the Traité de ΓHomme), Malebranche was forthwith alive to his true vocation. So overpowered was he by the novelty and luminousness of the ideas, and by the solidity and coherence of the principles of his author, that (it is said) he was repeatedly compelled by violent palpitations of the heart to lay aside his reading. Malebranche was from that hour consecrated to philosophy, and especially to that of Descartes; and after ten years’ study of the works of his master he produced, in 167 4, the famous Recherche de la Vérité, which was followed at intervals by other works, both speculative and controversial, the titles of which are given below. Like most of the great metaphysicians of the 17th century, Malebranche interested himself also in questions of mathematics and natural philosophy, and in 1699 he was admitted an honorary member of the Academy of Sciences. During his later years his society was much courted, and he received many visits from foreigners of distinction. His death took place on October 13, 1715; according to Stock, the biographer of Berkeley, it was hastened by an excited metaphysical argument into which he had been drawn in the course of an interview sought by that philosopher. For a critical account of Malebranche’s place in the history of philosophy, see Cartesianism (vol. v. p. 148 sq.).

The following is a list of his principal works :— De la Recherche de la Vérité, ou l'on traite de la nature de l'esprit de l'homme, et de l’usage qu'il en doit faire pour éviter l'erreur dans les sciences (1674, 6th ed. 1712; Latin translation by J. Lenfant at Geneva in 1685; two English translations, the second by Taylor in 1712; translations also into German, Dutch, and modern Greek); Conversations Chrétiennes, dans lesquelles on justifie la Vérité de la Religion et de la Morale de Jesus Christ (1676, and frequently); Traité de la Nature et de la Grace, 1680; Méditations Chrétiennes et Métaphysiques, 1683; Traité de la Morale, 1684; several polemical works against Arnauld from 1684 to 1688; Entretiens sur la Métaphysique et la Religion, 1688; Traité de l' Amour de Dieu, 1697; Entretien d'un Philosophe Chrétien et d’un Philosophe Chinois sur ΐ existence et la nature de Dieu, 1708; Réflexions sur la Prémotion Physique, 1715. A convenient edition of the Oeuvres choisies de Malebranche, in two volumes, with an introduction, was published by Jules Simon in 1846.
