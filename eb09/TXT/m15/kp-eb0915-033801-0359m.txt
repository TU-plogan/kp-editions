MALSTATT-BURBACH, a town in the district of Treves, Prussia, is situated on the right bank of the Saar (Sarre), almost contiguous with the town of St Johann, and separated from Saarbrücken by the river. It lies in the midst of an important coal-mining and industrial district, and is itself little more than a long and narrow row of manufactories and workmen’s houses. The largest factories are engaged in the production of iron, steel, and cement, one iron-work employing nearly 2000 men, and producing 285,000 tons of raw and manufactured metal annually. There is a large wharf on the river for the export of coal. At the census of 1880 Malstatt-Burbach contained 13,158 inhabitants.

Malstatt is of very ancient origin, and received municipal rights in 1321. These, however, were afterwards resigned to the newer town of Saarbrücken, and in 1818 Malstatt and Burbach were two small villages with a joint population of only 822. About the· middle of the century the population began to increase rapidly, in consequence of the development of the mining industry of the district and the extension of the railway system, and in 1875 the two villages were united to form a town. In 1870 Malstatt-Burbach was cannonaded by French troops under the command of Napoleon III.
