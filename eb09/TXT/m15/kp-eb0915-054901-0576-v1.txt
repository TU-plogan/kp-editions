MARIUPOL, a seaport of Russia, on the northern shore of the Sea of Azoff, at the mouth of the Kalmius, in the government of Ekaterinoslav, 55 miles west of Taganrog. It is connected by a branch railway with the line between Kharkoff and Taganrog, and is situated on the highway between the latter town and the Crimea. The place is said to have been inhabited in remote times under the name of Adamakha; but the present town was built only in 1779 by Greek emigrants from the Crimea who settled on the shores of the Sea of Azoff and on the left bank of the lower Kalmius. Mariupol is the chief town of this district, the 40,000 inhabitants of which are engaged in agriculture, cattle-breeding, and fishing, and sell their produce in the town. In export trade Mariupol ranks next to Taganrog among the ports of the Sea of Azoff; but its harbour is open to the south-east and shallow, the line of 14 feet being 1∣ miles from the shore, with a narrow strip, 12 to 22 feet deep, which allows larger flat-bottomed ships to approach the town, especially during south-east winds. Like all ports on this sea it is becoming more and more •shallow. Mariupol is visited every year by about 150 foreign ships (about 30,000 tons) and by 700 to 8G0 coasting vessels (65,000 tons), mainly carrying wheat and linseed, as also skins and tallow, from the Greek district, and from the provinces of Don and Ekaterinoslav. The importance of the port may increase when the mineral riches of the district (coal close to the sea-shore, kaolin, a,nd quartz sand) are exploited. Population, with two suburbs, Marinsk and Karasou, 9800
