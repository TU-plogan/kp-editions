MATTER, Properties of. If we knew thoroughly the nature of any piece of matter, the deduction of its properties would be a question of mere reasoning, just as (for instance) the definition of a circle really involves all the properties which mathematical methods have deduced from it. But, as we do not even know what matter is, in the abstract, the converse operation is (at least for the present) the natural and necessary one. We must endeavour from the experimentally ascertained properties of matter to discover what it is. The reader will find the limits of our present knowledge in the article Atom. The properties of matter may be arranged in several classes, thus :—

1. Properties of matter in itself; such as Inertia, Hardness, Brittleness, Elasticity (7.v.), Density, Compressibility, Viscosity, <fcc. These depend upon its ultimate structure and upon the law and intensity of the so-called molecular forces. See Atom, Constitution of Bodies, Attraction.

2. Relative properties of different kinds of matter, chemical, catalytic, <fcc. See Capillary Action, Chemistry, Diffusion, &c.

3. Properties relative to different forms of energy :— Conductivity (Thermal and Electric), Specific Gravity, Specific and Latent Heat, Transparency, Colour, Specific Inductive Capacity, Radiating and Absorbing Power, Magnetic Retentiveness, &c., Thermo-electric Position, Refractive Index, Reflective Power, Double Refraction, Rotatory Polarization, &c. These will be found mainly under the heads Electricity, Heat, Light, Magnetism, <tc.
