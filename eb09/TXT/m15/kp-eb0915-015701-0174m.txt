MACKENZIE, Sir Alexander (1755-1820), a Canadian explorer, was a native of Inverness. Having emigrated at an early age to Canada, he was for a number of years engaged in the fur trade at Fort Chipewyan, on the north side of the Lake of the Hills, and it was there that his schemes of travel were formed. His first journey (3d July to 27th September 1789)—for which he had prepared himself by a year’s study in England of astronomy and navigation—was from Fort Chipewyan along the Great Slave Lake and down the river which now bears his name to the Frozen Ocean; and his second (October 1792 to July 1793) from Fort Chipewyan up the Peace river across to the Columbia river, and thence westward to the coast of the Pacific at Cape Menzies, opposite Queen Charlotte Islands. The narrative of these expeditions ( Voyages through North America to the Frozen and Pacific Oceans, London, 1801) is of considerable interest from the information it contains about the native tribes; and it is prefaced by an historical dissertation on the Canadian fur trade. Mackenzie was rewarded for his discoveries by the honour of knighthood in 1801.
