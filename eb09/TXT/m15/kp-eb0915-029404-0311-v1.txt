MAIMANSINH, or Mymensing⅛ a district in the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, India, lying between 23° 56' and 25° 25' N. lat., and 89° 43' and 91° 18' E. long., with an area of 6287 square miles, is bounded on the N. by the Gâro Hills, on the E. by Sylhet, on the S.E. by Tipperah, on the S. by Dacca, and on the W. by the river Jamunâ, which separates it from Pabna, Bogra, and Rangpur districts. It is, for the most part, level and open, covered with well-cultivated fields, and intersected by numerous rivers. The Madhupur jungle is a slightly elevated tract, extending from the north of Dacca district into the heart of Maimansinh, almost as far as the Brahmaputra; its average height is about 60 feet above the level of the surrounding country, and it nowhere exceeds 100 feet. The jungle contains abundance of sdl, valuable both as timber and for charcoal. During the cold season the open parts of the jungle afford grazing grounds for cattle. The only other elevated tract in the district is on the southern border, where the Susang hills rise. They are for the most part covered with thick thorny jungle, but in parts are barren and rocky. The Jamunà forms the western boundary of Maimansinh for a course of 94 miles. It is [9:15:295] navigable for large boats throughout the year; and during the rainy season it expands in many places to 5 or 6 miles in breadth, overflowing a considerable portion of low-lying land. The Brahmaputra enters Maimansinh at its north-western corner near Karâibari, and flows south-east and south till it joins the Meghnâ a little below Bhairab Bâzâr. The gradual formation of chars and bars of sand in the upper part of its course has diverted the main volume of water into the present channel of the Jamunâ, which has in consequence become of much more importance than the Brahmaputra proper. The Meghnà only flows through the south-east portion of the district for a short distance. The eastern and south-eastern parts of the district abound in marshes. The wild animals include tigers, leopards, deer, bears, elephants, and an occasional rhinoceros. Small game is abundant.

The census of 1872 returned the population of Maimansinh at 2,349,917 (males, 1,187,962; and females, 1,161,955),—Mohammedans numbering 1,519,635; Hindus, 817,963; Christians, 124. Of aboriginal tribes the most numerous are the Hajongs (24,936) and Gâros (10,997). The semi-Hinduized aborigines number in all 205,592, of whom more than one-half are Chandäls (123,262), the most numerous caste in the district, employed as cultivators, fishermen, labourers, and menial servants. Among high-caste Hindus, Brahmans number 33,414. Five towns contain upwards of 5000 inhabitants:—Maimansinh or Nasirabâd, 10,068; Jamalpur, 14,302; Kisoriganj, 13,637; Sherpùr, 8015; and Dhanikhola, 6730. Ulakandi or Bhairab Bazar, although with only a population of 1500, is the most important commercial mart, with a large trade in jute and a well-supplied cattle-market. Rice, of which three crops are raised annually, forms the staple food crop of the district. Other agricultural products are wheat, oats, maize, pulses, linseed, mustard, til, indigo, tobacco, sugarcane, pdn, and jute. The last constitutes the chief commercial staple. Maimansinh suffers occasionally from blights and floods, but never to any serious extent. The chief imports are piece goods, raw cotton, wheat, betel nuts, chillies, sugar, and cattle; the exports consist of rice, jute, indigo, reed-mats, hides, brass and copper utensils, cheese, ghi, &c. Tobacco and muslins are also exported to a small extent. Besides a little muslin, the only manufactures are coarse silk cloth, sitalpati mats, cheese, and ghi. Apart from the rivers, means of communication are afforded by about 146 miles of good and 124 miles of inferior roads. Although the general revenue (£166,938 in 1880-81) has more than doubled in seventy-five years, the land revenue has remained almost stationary; in 1880-81 it was only £75,226, excise amounting to £23,652, and stamps to £48,680. Education in 1872-73 was afforded by 173 state-supported schools attended by 6372 pupils, besides 71 unaided schools, with 2425 pupils. Except towards the close of the rainy season, the climate is fairly healthy. The average annual rainfall is 105 inches.
