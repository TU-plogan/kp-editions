MACERATA, a city of Italy, the chief town of a province, a bishop’s see, and the seat of a court of appeal, lies 22 miles south of Ancona, and 17 miles by road west of Civita Nova, the nearest station on the East Coast Railway. Crowning the top of a hill about 1300 feet in height with a picturesque mass of buildings enclosed by walls and towers, Macerata looks out over the Adriatic and the valleys of the Potenza and the Clιienti. The cathedral·is a modern structure of but little interest; but some of the churches, and especially some of the palaces, —Palazzo dei Torri, Palazzo Bonaccor⅞j, <kc.,—are fine pieces of architecture; and at a short distance from the town stands the beautiful S. Maria delle Vergini, designed by Galasso da Carpi, but often attributed to Bramante. Besides the university, Macerata contains a communal library founded by Leo XII., and, in the municipal buildings, a collection of antiquities from Helvia Ricina. Its infant schools were the first established in the papal states. Glass and pottery are among the manufactures, and three fairs are held yearly. The population of the commune has increased from 19,283 in 1861 to 20,219 in 1881; that of the town was 10,065 at the former date.

Macerata, as well as Recanati, was founded by the inhabitants of Ricina after the destruction of their city by Alaric in 408. During the Lombard period it was a flourishing town; but it was from comparative insignificance that it was raised by Nicholas IV. to be the seatx>f the governors of the March. By the viceroy of Frederick II. it was enclosed in the 13th century by a new line of walls more than 2⅛ miles in circuit; and in the troubles of the next two hundred years it had frequent occasion to learn their value. For the most part it remained faithful to the popes, and in return it was rewarded by a multitude of privileges. Though in 1797 the inhabitants opened their gates to the French, two years afterwards, when the country people took refuge within the walls, the city was taken by storm and delivered to pillage. The bishopric of Macerata dates from the suppression of the see of Becanati (1320). Crescimbeni, the poet of the 13th century, his namesake the founder of the Arcadian Academy at Bome, and Matteo Ricci, the Chinese missionary and scholar, were natives pf the city.
