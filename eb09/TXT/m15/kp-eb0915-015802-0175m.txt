+====================================================================+


MACKENZIE, Henry (1745-1831), was born at Edinburgh in August 1745. His father was Dr Joshua or Josiah Mackenzie, a successful physician, who also cultivated letters in a small way. Mackenzie got the ordinary education of a youth in his position at the high school and university of Edinburgh, and was afterwards articled to Mr Inglis, who was then attorney for the crown in the management of exchequer affairs. To this comfortable post the author in due time succeeded, and perhaps knew as little as any of that tribe ever did about the struggles and sorrows of a literary career. For his work’s sake it would have been better if he had travelled some of life’s rougher paths, or else been content to write about what he had actually seen in the Scottish world of that day. There was plenty of material there if he had had the open eye to see it, as "Walter Scott showed by and by; and it is a pity that Mackenzie did not try his hand at it, having been more in the heart of it than Scott could ever have been. As it is, his stories are clearly not the fruit of his experience, but rather the echo of his reading. He could write graceful enough sentences, somewhat artificial, yet smooth and pointed; but the men he describes are mere shadows, and the life altogether unreal. His first and best-known work, The Man of Feeling, was published anonymously when he was only twenty-six years of age, and soon became highly popular. It was a droughty season in Scottish literature, and therefore any little blossom, however sickly, was welcome for its rarity. Hume and Robertson and Smith had left the scene; Burns was just learning to think of the daisy he turned up with his ploughshare, and Fergusson had lately closed his brief and troubled career. Mackenzie had the field all to himself, and got the attention which is given to a solitary figure. He had read the Sentimental Journey, as one can see from expressions here and there, as well as from the affectation of writing his story in a fragmentary form; but he had not a gleam of Sterne’s humour to relieve the sentimentality. He had read Richardson too, but he had none of that writer’s subtle insight into character. Perhaps Goldsmith was his real model, but the likeness was as that between a firefly and a star. The “man of feeling” is a weak foolish creature, possessed with a futile benevolence, who goes up to London, where his friends should never have let him go, and meets a variety of sharpers, and comes out of their hands pretty much as Goldsmith makes the vicar’s son do, only without the fun that clings to poor Moses. For this book is all in one key, sentimental and lachrymose, and the hero dies at last, from no particular cause, in a highly tragic fashion beside his fainting mistress. His next work, The Man of the World, is the picture of a born villain, a rogue in grain, who begins his rascality at school, perhaps earlier, and carries it through with entire consistency to the end. The man is unnaturally bad, and the incidents are badly unnatural; and such a book at present would only find a place in some third-rate penny paper, if even there. Julia de Roubigηe, his only other novelette, was meant to depict the misfortunes of a number of quite blameless people—to be, in short, a tragedy without a villain, an Othello without an Iago. But, as it has no insight, and does not even try to have any insight, into the mystery of such’ calamities, the result is insipid and tedious. All these works had great popularity in their day; but that day is long past, and what life they now have is only a tradition.

Mackenzie also wrote several dramas, mostly of the tragic sort, for in that tone he had won his successes, such [9:15:159] as they were. But one who had no conception of distinct character, of human individuality, was not likely to succeed in the drama, which depends more on that than on anything; and hence it was not our author’s good fortune to deliver his country from the stigma of never having produced a genuine tragedy. Of The Spanish Father, The Prince of Tunis, and The Shipwreck, the second was brought on the stage, and managed to live for six nights; the other two were stillborn, and probably no man living·has ever read them, unless for purely critical purposes.

But Mackenzie, if nowise a great writer, but quite otherwise essentially a small writer, with a knack of making sentences indeed, but having nothing particular of his own to say, was not therefore altogether a useless man in his day. That he did well for himself, and perhaps for the exchequer too, is quite likely, even though he toiled in the high-Tory service of Dundas, and wrote tracts meant to “broom” out of the country the tide of French Revolutionary notions. At any rate he became in his old age a kind of literary centre and social power in Edinburgh, when that was really needed and useful. He had known John Home and blind Dr Blacklock, and wrote lives of them; but, what is of more consequence, he was among the first to recognize the genius of Robert Burns, as editor of The Lounger, which he and a group of young men with some literary tastes wrote and printed for some years. Yet, though he once breakfasted with Johnson, and certainly met Burns more than once, he has told us nothing about either of them, though a page of Burns’s talk would have been worth all The Man of Feeling twice told. It was so far good, however, that he hailed the peasant poet cordially, which we could hardly have hoped so artificial a writer would do, and even better that he noticed the dawn of German literature when Lessing and Schiller rose above the horizon, and not only wrote some account of them, taken from French sources, but boldly set to the study of German that he might really know them at first hand. How far he went in that study we do not know, only he set young Walter Scott on the scent, with results such as he himself could never have imagined. So he lived on, a kind of small king in the Edinburgh literary world, till 1831, dying in his eighty-sixth year, with a wonderful new world around him, which had not yet begun to criticize, but only to admire and honour him.
