MARSHAL (from Old High German maralι, horse, and scale, care-taker), in its original signification a servant of the royal manege^ was afterwards a title given in different countries to the holder of various high offices, military and civil. In the time of Philip Augustus the commander of the French forces was called the marshal of France. Under Francis I. the marshals of France became two in number, under Henry III. four, and in the time of Louis XIV. their number was raised to twenty. In England the marshal was a high officer of state as far back as the 12th century. In the end of the 12th and first half of the 13th century the office was conferred on the earls of Pembroke, from whom it passed by female descent to the family of Bigod, earl of Norfolk. The dignity of earlmarshal was afterwards held successively by the Mowbrays, dukes of Norfolk, the Howards, dukes of Norfolk, and the earls of Arundel and Norwich. Under a grant by Charles II. to.Henry Howard, earl of Norwich, it has descended to and continues in the line of the existing dukes of Norfolk. The marshal was in feudal times (in conjunction with the constable, a still higher officer) the judge in the court of chivalry, which had cognizance of questions of honour and dignity; and, when the king headed his army in person, it was the marshal who selected the proper spot for the encampment of each noble. The constable’s powers and duties were superseded in the reign of Henry VIII.; but the earl-marshal is still the head of the Heralds’ College, and appoints the officers of arms. In Scotland (an orthography resembling the French maréchal being adopted) the office of marischal, probably introduced under David I., became from the 14th century hereditary in the family of Keith. The Scottish marischal became an earl under the designation of “earl-marischal” in 1458. Marischal College in Aberdeen was founded and endowed by the munificence of George, 5th earl-marischal. The dignity came to an end by the attainder of George, 10th earl-marischal, in 1716. The military title of field-marshal was at first borrowed by the Germans from the French maréchal de champs·, and in the Thirty Years’ War it meant much what quartermaster-general does now. It was not till last century that the word rose in dignity so as to signify the highest military dignity except that of commander-in-chief. It was adopted into the British military system from Germany,—the first field-marshals being John, duke of Argyll, and George, earl of Orkney, made so by George II. in 1736.
