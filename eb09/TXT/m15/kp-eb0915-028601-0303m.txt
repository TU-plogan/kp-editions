MAHI KANTHÁ, The, a group of native states forming a political agency under the Government of Bombay, India, lying between 23° 14 ’ and 24° 28’ N. lat. and 72° 40 , and 74° 5' E. long.; with an area of about 4000 square miles, and an estimated population of 447,056. It is bounded on the N.E. by the Râjput states of Udâipur and Dunyarpur, on the S.E. by Rewa Kanthâ, on the S. by Kaira district, and on the W. by the native states of Baroda and the Pâlanpur agency. The Mahi Kanthâ territory is divided among a number of chiefs, of whom the râjâ of Edar is by far the most important. In May 1877 these chiefs were classified in seven divisions, according to their importance and the extent of their jurisdiction. There are two states of the second class, three of the third, nine of the fourth, nine of the fifth, fourteen of the sixth, and fourteen of the seventh class. The entire revenues amount to about £110,000.
