MAXIMUS, St, abbot of Chrysopolis, known as “the Confessor” from his orthodox zeal in the Monothelite controversy, or as “the monk,” was born of noble parentage at Constantinople about the year 580. Educated with great care, he early became distinguished by his talents and,acquirements, and some time after the accession of the emperor Heraclius in 610 was made his private secretary. In 630 he abandoned the secular life and entered the monastery of Chrysopolis (Scutari), actuated, it was believed, less by any longing for the life of a recluse than by the dissatisfaction he felt with the Monothelite leanings of his master. The date of his promotion to the abbacy is uncertain. In 633 he was one of the party of Sophronius at the council of Alexandria; and in 645 he was again in Africa, when he held in presence of the governor and a number of bishops the disputation with Pyrrhus, the deposed and banished patriarch of Constantinople, which resulted in the (temporary) conversion of his interlocutor to the Dyothelite view. In the following year several African synods, held under the influence of Maximus, declared for orthodoxy. In 649, after the accession of Martin I., he went to Rome, and did much to fan the zeal of the new pope, who in October of that year held the (first) Lateran synod, by which not only the Monothelite doctrine but also the moderating ecthesis of Heraclius and typus of Constans II. were anathematized. About 653 Maximus, for the part he had taken against the latter document especially, was apprehended by order of Constans and carried a prisoner to Constantinople, and in 655, after repeated examinations, in which he maintained his theological opinions with memorable constancy, was banished to Byzia in Thrace, and afterwards to Perberis. In 662 he was again brought to Constantinople and was condemned by a synod there to be scourged, to have his tongue cut out by the root, and to have his right hand chopped off. After this sentence had been carried out he was again banished to Lazica, where he died on August 13, 662. He is venerated as a saint both in the Greek and in the Latin Church,—in the former on January and on August 12th and 13th, in the latter on August 13th.

Λ collection of his works, which are of importance for the history of the Monothelite controversy, was undertaken by Combefis, who published two volumes in 1675 (<S ’. Maximi Confessoris, Graecorum Theologi, eximiique Philosophi Opera), but did not live to complete his labours. A list of the more important of the writings of Maximus, with bibliographical details, will be found in Smith’s Dictionary of Biography and Mythology, an exhaustive “Catalogue raisonné,” by Wagenmann, occurs in vol. ix. (1881) of the new edition of Herzog’s Real·Encyklopadie. The details of the disputation with Pyrrhus and of the martyrdom are given very fully and clearly in Hefele’s Conc.-gesch., vol. iii.
