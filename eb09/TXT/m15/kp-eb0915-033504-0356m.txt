MALMESBURY, a parliamentary borough and markettown of Wilts, England, is finely situated on an eminence [9:15:336] almost surrounded by the Lower Avon, and on a branch of the Great Western Railway, 92 miles west of London. Of the Benedictine house which was founded in the 7th century, and in the reign of Edward III. rose to the dignity of a mitred abbey, little more than the nave and side aisles of the conventual church now remain; this at the dissolution was changed into a parish church, instead of the old church of St Paulâ€™s. There are a townhall, national and endowed schools, and several almshouses. In the market-place there is a richly ornamented octagonal cross supposed to date from the reign of Henry VIII. The industries include the manufacture of ribbons and pillow lace, brewing, and tanning. The population of the town in 1871 was 3142, and of the parliamentary borough (which comprises an area of 21,772 acres, mostly rural) 6879. In 1881 the numbers were 3133 and 6866.

Malmesbury is supposed to have been a British town, and also a Roman settlement. A castle is known to have existed there as early as the 7th century, at which time the monastery was also founded. It received its first charter from Edward the Elder, which was confirmed by Athelstan. The charter granted to it by Charles I. has undergone various modifications, and at present it is governed by a high steward, an aiderman, and twelve capital burgesses. From the reign of Edward I. the town sent two members to parliament; since the Reform Act of 1832 it has returned only one. During the civil war it was twice captured by the parliamentarians and once by the royalists. Malmesbury is the birthplace of the philosopher Hobbes. Athelstan was buried at Malmesbury, but the Gothic canopy in the church called his tomb dates from the 16th century.
