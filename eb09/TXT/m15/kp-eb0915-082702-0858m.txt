MEGAPODE, the name given generally to a-small but remarkable Family of birds, highly characteristic of some parts of the Australian Region, to which it is almost peculiar. The Megapodiidae with the Cracidae form that division of the Order Gallinae named by Professor Huxley Peristeropodes (Proc. Zool. Society, 1868, p. 296), and norρhologically seem to be the lowest of the Order, with which apparent fact may perhaps be correlated their singular habit of leaving their eggs to be hatched without incubation, burying them in the ground (as many Reptiles do) or heaping over them a mound of earth, leaves, and rotten wood. This habit attracted attention more than three hundred years ago,^[1. Antonio Pigafetta, one of the survivors of Magellan's glorious but disastrous voyage, records in his journal, under date of April 1521, among the peculiarities of the Philippine Islands, then first discovered by Europeans, the existence of a bird there, about the size of a Fowl, which laid its eggs, as big as a Duck’s, in the sand, and left them to be hatched by the heat of the sun (Premier Voyage autour du Monde, ed. Aτnoretti, Paris, A.R. ix. p. 88). More than a hundred years later the Jesuit Nieremberg, in his Historia Naturae, published at Antwerp in 1635, described (p. 207) a bird called “Daie,” and by the natives named “Tapun,” not larger than a Dove, which, with its tail (!) and feet, excavated a nest in sandy places and laid therein eggs bigger than those of a Goose. The publication at Rome in 1651 of Hernandez’s Hist. Avium Novae Hispaniae shews that his papers must have been accessible to Nieremberg, who took from them the passage just mentioned, but, as not unusual with him, misprinted the names which stand in Hernandez’s work (p. 56, cap. 220) “Daic” and “Tapum” respectively, and omitted his predecessor’s important addition “Viuit in Philippicis.” Not long after, the Dominican Navarrete, a missionary to China, made a considerable stay in the Philippines, and returning to Europe in 1673 wrote an account of the Chinese empire, of which Churchill (Collection of Voyages and Travels, vol. i.) gave an English translation in 1704. It is therein stated (p. 45) that in many of the islands of the Malay Archipelago “there is a very singular bird call’d Tdbon," and that “What I and many more admire is, that it being no biggei' in Body than an ordinary Chicken, tho’ long legg’d, yet it lays an Egg larger than a Gooses, so that the Egg is bigger than the bird itself. . . . In order to lay its Eggs, it digs ill the Sand above a yard in depth; after laying, it fills up the hole and makes it even with the rest; there the Eggs hatch with the heat of the Sun and Sand.” He adds further information which need not be quoted here. Gemelli Careri, who travelled from 1663 to 1699, and in the latter year published an account of his voyage round the world, gives similar evidence respecting this remarkable bird, which he calls “Tavon,” in the Philippine Islands ( I ay. du tour du Monde, ed. Paris, 1727, v. pp. 15/, 158). The Megapode of Luzon is fairly described by Camel or Camelli in his observations on the Birds of the Philippines communicated by Petiver to the Royal Society in 1703 (Phil. Trans., xxiii. p. 1398). In 1726 Valentyn published his elaborate work on the East Indies, wherein (deel iii. bk. v. p. 320) he very correctly describes the Megapode of Amboina under the name of “Malleloe,” and also a larger kin<l found in Celebes, so as to shew he had in the course of his long residence in the Dutch settlements become personally acquainted with both. ] but the accounts given of it by various travellers were generally discredited by naturalists,^[2. Thus Willughby (Ornilhologia, p. 297), or Ray for him, who ha<l, however, only Nieremberg’s evidence to cite, ami they can scarcely be blamed for their hesitation, considering the number of other marvels narrated by the same worthy father. Buffon also (Oiseaux, ix. p. 436) was just as sceptical in regard’to the relation of Careri. ] and as examples of the birds, probably from their unattractive plumage, appear not to have been brought to Europe, no one of them was seen by any ornithologist or scientifically described until near the end of the first quarter of the present century. The first member of the Family to receive authoritative recognition was one of the largest, inhabiting the continent of Australia, where it is known as the Brush-Turkey, and was originally described by Latham in 1821 under the name of the New-Holland Vulture, a misleading designation which he subsequently tried to correct on perceiving its Galline character. It is the Talegallus lathami of modern ornithologists, and is nezrly the size of a hen Turkey. Six smaller species of the same genus have since been described, all from New Guinea or the neighbouring islands, but two of them, T. pyrrhopygius and T. bruyni, have been separated to form a group Aepypodcus The Australian bird is of a sooty-brown colour, relieved beneath by the lighter edging of some of the feathers, but the head and neck are nearly bare, beset with fine bristles, the skin being of a deep pinkish-red, passing above the breast into a large wattle of bright yellow. The tail is commonly carried upright and partly folded, something like that of a domestic Fowl.

The next form of which we may speak is another inhabitant of Australia, commonly known in England as the Mallee-bird, but to the colonists as the “Native Pheasant”—the Lipoa ocellata, described by Gould in the zoological Proceedings for 1840 (p. 126), which has much shorter tarsi and toes, the head entirely clothed, and the tail expanded. Its plumage presents a pleasing combination of greys and browns of various tints, interspersed with black, white, and buff, the wing-coverts and feathers [9:15:828] of the back bearing each near the tip an oval or subcircular patch, whence the trivial scientific name of the bird is given, while a stripe of black feathers with a median line of white extends down the front of the throat, from the chin to the breast. There is but one species of this genus known, as is also the case with the next to be mentioned, which is a singular bird long known to inhabit Celebes, but not fully described until 1846,^[3. As we have seen, it was mentioned in 1726 by Valentyn, and a young example was in 1830 described and figured by Quoy and Gaimard (Voy. de VAstrolabe: Oiseaux, p. 239, pl. 25) as the Mega· podius rubripes of Temminck, a wholly different bird. ] when it received from Salomon Miiller (Arch. f. Naturgeschichte, xii. pt. 1, p. 116) the name of Macrocephal<yn maleo, but, being shortly afterwards figured by Gray and Mitchell (Gen. Birds, iii. pl. 123) under the generic term of Megacephalon, has since commonly borne the latter appellation. This is a very remarkable form, bearing a helmet-like protuberance on the back of its head, all of which as well as the neck is bare and of a bright red colour; the plumage of the body is glossy black above, and beneath roseate-white.

Of the Megapodes proper, constituting the genus Megapodius, many species have been described, but authorities are greatly at variance as to the validity of several, and here it would be impossible to name all that have been supposed to exist. Some are only known from very young examples—mere chickens; and some have even been described from their eggs alone. In 1870 Mr G. R. Gray enumerated twenty species, of which sixteen were represented in the British Museum, and several have been described since; but ten years later Professor Schlegel recognized only seventeen species, of which examples of twelve were contained in the Leyden Museum (Mus. des Pays-Bas, viii., Monogr. 41, pp. 56-86), while Μ. Oustalet, in his elaborate monograph of the Family (Ann. Sc. Nat., Zoologie, ser. 6, vols. x. and xi.), admits nineteen species. The birds of this genus range from the Samoa Islands in the east, through the Tonga group, to the New Hebrides, the northern part of Australia, New Guinea and its neighbouring islands, Celebes, the Pelew Islands, and the Ladrones, and have also outliers in detached portions of the Indian Region, as the Philippines (where indeed they were first discovered by Europeans), Labuan, and even the Nicobars—though none are known from the intervening islands of Borneo, Java, or Sumatra. Within what may be deemed their proper area they are found, says Mr Wallace (Geogr. Distr. Animals, ii. p. 341) “on the smallest islands and sand-banks, and can evidently pass over a few miles of sea with ease.” Indeed proof of their roaming disposition is afforded by the fact that the bird described by Lesson (Voy. Coquille: Zoologie, p. 703) as Alecthelia urvillii, but now considered to be the young of Megapodius freycineti, flew on board his ship when more than 2 miles from the nearest land (Guebé), in an exhausted state, it is true, but that may be attributed to its extreme youth. The species of Megapodius are about the size of small Fowls, the head generally crested, the tail very short, the feet enormously large, and, with the exception of Μ. wallacii (Proc. Zool. Society, 1860, Aves, pl. 171), from the Moluccas, all have a sombre plumage.

The extraordinary habit possessed by the Megapodes generally of relieving themselves of the duty of incubation, as before mentioned,—a habit which originally attracted the attention of travellers, whose stories were on that very account discredited,—as well as the highly developed condition of the young at birth, has been so fully described by Gould (Handb. B. Australia, ii. pp. 152- 175), G. R. Gray (Proc. Zool. Society, 1861, pp. 292-296), and Mr Wallace (Malay Archipelago, i. pp. 415-419; ii. pp. 147-149), and so often repeated by other writers, as to be very commonly known, and here there seems no necessity to enter into further details concerning it.
