MANFRED (c. 1231-1266), regent and king of the Two Sicilies, a natural son of the emperor Frederick II. by Bianca Lanzia, the daughter of a Lombard earl, was born in Sicily about 1231, and received from his father the title of prince of Tarentum in 1248. Frederick II. at his death appointed him regent of the Two Sicilies during the absence of his brother Conrad IV., and notwithstanding the hostility of Innocent IV., and the revolt of many nobles and towns in Apulia at the instigation of that pontiff, he was able in 1252 to hand over to Conrad an undivided sovereignty. On the death of the latter in 1254, Manfred was once more called to the regency in the interests of his infant nephew Conradin, and by his victory over the forces of Innocent IV. at Foggia on December 2d of that year was able to establish his authority over the entire kingdom. When in 1258 rumours had reached Sicily of the death of Conradin, Manfred, yielding to the solicitations of his prelates, barons, and people, allowed himself to be crowned at Palermo on August 11. Shortly afterwards envoys arrived from the mother of Conradin to say that he was still alive, and to demand the crown for him; but this the king, strong in the popularity which he had acquired by his brave defence of his country, by his pleasing person, and by his many accomplishments, declined to give, promising only to preserve the crown for his nephew, [9:15:479] and faithfully to bequeath it to him on his own death. Excommunicated in 1259 by Alexander IV., Manfred again resorted to arms, and overrunning the papal states, was made master of Tuscany by the battle of Monte Aperto (September 4, 1260). Now at the height of his power, he was anew excommunicated by Urban IV. in 1261, and in 1263 his forfeited crown was offered to Charles, count of Anjou, and brother of Louis IX. of France. Towards the end of summer in 1265, giving effect to a crusade proclaimed by Urban, Charles with his army entered Piedmont, but the encounter with the Sicilians did not take place until February 1266 at Benevento, where Manfred, filled with despair by the cowardly flight of his Apulians, spurred into the thickest of the battle and fell covered with wounds. His mangled body was hastily buried under a heap of stones near the bridge, but afterwards, at the instance of Pope Clement IV., was dragged out and laid in unconsecrated ground on the frontier of the kingdom.
