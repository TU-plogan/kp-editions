MAISTRE, Xavier de, the younger brother of Joseph, was born at Chambéry in October 1763, and died at St Petersburg on the 12th June 1852. He served when young in the Piedmontese army, and wrote his Voyage autour de ma Chambre when he was in garrison at Turin. This, a delightful fantasy piece which may have owed something to the example of Sterne in its conception, but which is quite original in execution, he showed to his brother Joseph, and on his approval it was published at Turin in 1794. Xavier, however, shared the politics and the loyalty of his brother, and the annexation of Savoy, followed as it was at no long date by the extinction of Piedmontese independence, made him quit his country. He served in the victorious Austro-Russian campaign in which Suwaroff performed such wonders, and accompanied the marshal to Russia. For a time he was in very reduced circumstances, and is said to have supported himself by painting. But on his brother’s arrival in St Petersburg he was introduced to the minister of marine. He was appointed to several posts in the capital, but also saw active service, was wounded in the Caucasus, and attained the rank of major-general. He married a Russian lady and established himself in his adopted country, even after the overthrow of Napoleon, and the consequent restoration of the Piedmontese dynasty. For a time, however, he lived at Naples, but he returned to St Petersburg and died there. He was only once at Paris (in 1839), when Sainte-Beuve, who has left some pleasant reminiscences of him, met him. Besides the Voyage already mentioned, Xavier de Maistre’s works (all of which are of very modest dimensions) are Le Lépreux de la Cité d’Aoste, a touching little story of human misfortune, Les Prisonniers du Caucase, a powerful sketch of Russian character, La Jeune Sibérienne, and the Expédition Nocturne, a sequel to the Voyage autour de ma Chambre. But his Voyage is, with the Lépreux, his title to fame. Both have a certain resemblance to Sterne, the first in its quaintness and desultory arrangement, the second in its sentiment. Xavier de Maistre is, however, much less artificial than his forerunner, especially in his pathos, and he is also much better bred. His style is of remarkable ease and purity. The works of Xavier de Maistre, with the exception of some brief chemical tractates, are usually printed in a single volume, which figures in the collections of Charpentier, Garnier, &c.
