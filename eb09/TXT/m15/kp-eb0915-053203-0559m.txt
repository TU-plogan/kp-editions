MARCELLUS, Marcus Claudius, Roman warrior, was born about 268 b,c., and served first in Sicily against Hamilcar. In his first consulship (222) he was engaged in the war against the Insubres, and won the spolia opima by slaying their chief Viridomarus. In 216 he was to have gone as praetor to Sicily with a fleet, but was detained on the news of the defeat at Cannae. He went to Canusium and took command of the fragments of the army. He tried without success to prevent Capua going over to Hannibal, but saved Nola. In 214 he was in Sicily as consul at the time of the revolt of Syracuse; he stormed Leontini and besieged Syracuse, but the engineering skill of Archimedes repelled his attacks and compelled him to content himself with a blockade. Himilco landed with a Carthaginian army, and Marcellus failed to prevent their occupying Agrigentum. Taking the opportunity of a feast of Artemis, Marcellus stormed Epipolae; but the old town and the island remained untaken, as also the fort of Euryalus, which was, however, cut off and soon fell. Meanwhile pestilence raged among the Carthaginian army encamped outside. After several months, during which disorder reigned in the town, he gained a lodgment by the aid of a Spanish officer, and Syracuse was surrendered (212). Marcellus spared the lives of the Syracusans, but carried off their art treasures to Rome. Consul again in 210, he took Salapia by help of the Roman party there, and put to death the Numidian garrison. Proconsul in 209, he attacked Hannibal near Venusia, and after a desperate battle retired to that town; he was accused of bad generalship, and had to leave the army to defend himself in Rome. In his last consulship (208), while both consuls were reconnoitring near Venusia, they were unexpectedly attacked, and Marcellus was killed. His successes have probably been exaggerated, but he was a brave soldier, and the name often given to him, the “sword of Rome,” was well deserved. Though plebeians, the Marcelli henceforth took a high position; they were hereditary patrons of Sicily.
