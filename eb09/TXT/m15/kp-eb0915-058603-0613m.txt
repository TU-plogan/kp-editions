MARTOS, a town of Spain, in the province of Jaen, is situated on the slope of a steep hill, which is surmounted by a ruined castle, 16 miles west-south-west of Jaen. The streets are steep, narrow, crooked, and ill-paved; the public buildings are of the usual order, and present no feature calling for special remark. The surrounding district is specially productive of oil, and in the neighbourhood of the town are two sulphurous springs much resorted to in cases of cutaneous disease. Population in 1877, 14,654.

Martos perhaps stands on or near the site of the Tucci of Ptolemy. By Ferdinand III. it was taken from the Moors in 1225, and given to the knights of Calatrava; it was there that the brothers Carvajal, commanders of the order, were in 1410 executed by command of Ferdinand IV. after he had been “summoned” by them to a meeting at the Divine judgment seat. O’Donnell here gained a victory over the royalist troops in 1854.
