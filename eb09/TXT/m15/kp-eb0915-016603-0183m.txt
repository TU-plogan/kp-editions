MACPHERSON, James (1738-1796), the “translator” of the Ossianic poems, was born at Ruthven, Inverness, Scotland, in 1738, was educated in his native village and at King’s College, Aberdeen, and from 1756 taught the school of Ruthven for some time. In 1758 he published a poem entitled the Highlander, and about the same period contributed several minor pieces to the Scots Magazine. In 1759, while residing with a pupil at Moffat, he became accidentally known to Dr Carlyle of Inveresk and Mr Home, the author of Douglas, both of them already interested in the subject of ancient Highland poetry; some fragmentary “translations” from the Gaelic, which in the course of a few days he supplied to Home, were much appreciated in the literary circles of Edinburgh, and in 1760 a volume was published by Macpherson, entitled Fragments of Ancient Poetry collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic or Erse Language, with a preface by Dr Blair. A sum of money was now subscribed by the faculty of advocates for the purpose of enabling Macpherson to go to the Scottish Highlands in search of other fragments, and the result of his labours was the publication at London in 1762 of Fingal, an Epic Poem, in six books, with other lesser Poems, dedicated to Lord Bute; this was followed in 1763 by Temora, in eight books, with several other poems. For the real character of these publications see Celtic Literature, vol. v. p. 313-4. At the time of their appearance they greatly advanced the translator both in fame and fortune; in 1764 he was appointed surveyor-general of the Floridas, and on his return to England two years afterwards he was permitted to retain for life the salary of the office. In 1771 he published An Introduction to the History of Great Britain and Ireland, and in 1775 A History of Great Britain from the Restoration to the Accession of the House of Hanover (2 vois. 4to) and Original Papers containing the Secret History of Great Britain for the same period (also in 2 vols. 4to). His translation of the Iliad, published in 1773, was greatly praised by Robertson and others in Scotland, but met with a severe reception in England, and has not stood the test of time. About 1779 he was appointed to the lucrative post of agent for the nabob of Arcot, and from 1780 onwards he sat in parliament for the borough of Camelford. He died at Belleville, an estate which he had recently purchased in Inverness, on February 17, 1796, and was buried in the Poets’ Corner at Westminster Abbey. His will had provided for the publication of the Ossianic poems in the original Gaelic, which he is understood to have been preparing for the press at the time of his death; and the work accordingly appeared in 3 vols. 8vo, in 1807, with a literal translation into Latin, by Robert Macfarlane, and a dissertation on the authenticity of the poems, by Sir John Sinclair.
