MANCHA, La. This name, when employed in its widest sense, denotes that bare and monotonous elevated plateau of central Spain which stretches between the mountains of Toledo and the western spurs of the hills of Cuenca, being bounded on the S. by the Sierra Morena and on the N. by the Alcarria, which skirts the upper course of the Tagus. It thus comprises portions of the modern provinces of Toledo, Albacete, apd Cuenca, and almost the whole of Ciudad Real. Down to the 16th century the eastern portion was known as La Mancha de Montearagon or de Aragon, and the western simply as La Mancha; afterward,“the north-eastern and south-western sections respectively were distinguished by the epithets “Alta” and “Baja” (upper and lower). La Mancha was created a province in 1691; its officially recognized boundaries have since that time varied considerably, and in common parlance it is often now identified with the modern province of Ciudad Real. Ciudad Real, which is bounded on the N. by Toledo and Cuenca, on the E. by Albacete, on the S. by Jaen and Cordova, and on the W. by Badajoz, ranks next to. Badajoz and Caceres in point of extent, containing an area of 7840 square miles. The population in 1877 was 260,641. From the scarcity of water and the absence of trees and fences, as also from the circumstance of the rural population being concentrated only at certain points, it as a whole presents to the traveller the arid and cheerless aspect of a desert. The principal river is the Guadiana, which rises in the so-called Ojos (“Eyes ”) del Guadiana in the north-east, and is joined by the Azuer and the Jabalon on the left, and by the united waters of the Zancara and Giguela on the right. No advantage, unfortunately, is taken of these or any of the other streams in the province for irrigation, the inhabitants depending entirely on the meagre and precarious rainfall. A peculiarity of the province is the facility with which water can be reached by digging; but neither has this resource been turned to much account. The mineral wealth of the province (lead, copper, iron, antimony, coal) is great, the cinnabar mines of Almaden, in particular, which were known to the ancients, being the chief European source for the supply of quicksilver. Saltpetre is obtained in several places, especially in the north (Herencia and Alcazar de San Juan), and there are quarries of fine stone at Santa Cruz and elsewhere. The crops, when not interfered with by drought and locusts, the two scourges of La Mancha, are very large; they include wheat, barley, rye, chick pease, wine (that of Valdepenas being especially famous), vinegar, and brandy, some oil, saffron, esparto, flax, and silk. The mules reared in the province are considered the best in or out of Spain. There are manufactures of woollen fabrics, lace, earthenware, cutlery, saltpetre, gunpowder, and soap. The lace of Almagro is much appreciated throughout the peninsula. The province is traversed by the Madrid and Cordova Railway, which enters near Alcazar de San Juan and passes through Manzanares and Valdepenas, entering Jaen at the Venta de Cardenas in the Sierra Morena. The Madrid and Badajoz line passes through Ciudad Real, the capital of the province, which is connected by rail with Manzanares. There are ten judicial partidos,—those of Alcâzar de San Juan, Almaden, Almagro, Almodôvar del Campo, Ciudad Real, Daimiel, Infantes, ‘Manzanares, Piedrabuena, and Valdepenas. The only towns having a population above 10,000 in 1877 were Almodôvar del Campo, Ciudad Real, and Valdepenas.
