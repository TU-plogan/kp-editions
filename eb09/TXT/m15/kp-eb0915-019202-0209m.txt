MADURA, a district in the south of the Madras presidency, India, lying between 9° 4' and 10° 44' N. lat., and 77° 14' and 79° 20' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Coimbatore, Trichinopoli, and Tanjore districts, E. and S.E. by the sea, S.W. by Tinιlevelli district, and W. by Travancore state. Broadly speaking, it consists of a section of the plain stretching from the mountains east to the sea, coinciding with the basin of the Vaigâi river, and gradually sloping to the south-east. The plain is broken in the west by the outlying spurs of the Ghâts, and by a few isolated hills and masses of rock scattered over the country. The most important spur of the Ghâts is that known as the Palni hills, which project east-north-east across the district for a distance of about 54 miles. Their highest peaks are more than 8000 feet above sea-level, and they enclose a plateau of about 100 square miles in area, with an average height of 7000 feet. A sanatarium has been recently established on this plateau, at Kodâikanal, and coffee planting is here successfully carried on. Farther east a confused group of hills, known as the Sirumalais, the highest of which has an elevation of nearly 4000 feet, clusters round the village of Nattam. Among isolated rocks may be mentioned the precipitous fortress of Dindigal, and the “Elephant Rock,” the “Cow Hill,” and the sacred Skandamalia—all in the immediate vicinity of Madura town. The chief river is the Vaigâi, which divides the district into two almost equal portions. Very little forest is found in any part of the district. The cultivated plain is absolutely barren of trees, except where a newly-planted avenue marks a line of road. Groves of palmyra and cocoa-nut palms flourish along the sea-coast and river banks. Among the wild products of the Palni hills are nutmeg, cinnamon, and pepper. The predominant geological formation is granite. Syenite occurs in large boulders. A gravelly bed of laterite, which runs across the district, is quarried for building purposes; and sandstone is said to extend along the whole length of the sea-coast. Mineral products include saltpetre, salt, lime, chalk, and graphite. Iron in various forms is found, but it is nowhere worked profitably, even by the rude native processes. Gold is washed in some of the streams. Several kinds of opal, chalcedony, jasper, garnet, and rock-crystal are found.

The census of 1871 showed a total population of 2,266,615 persons (1,112,066 males and 1,154,549 females), spread over an area of 9502 square miles, and inhabiting 5459 villages and 443,513 houses. Hindus numbered 2,062,768, and Mohammedans 132,833; and the Catholics at the present day number about 60,000, under the charge of the missions of the Jesuits and of the Church of Goa. The Protestant population are under the charge of an American mission, first established in 1834. The principal towns are Madura city (51,987), Dindigal (12,818), Palni (12,801), Râmnâd (15,442), Tirumangalam (5772), Parambakudi (6284), Sivagangâ (7392), Killakarài, Aruppukotai, and Periyakulam. The only municipalities are Madura and Dindigal.

Of a total area of 9502 square miles, 6507 belong to zamînélâri or permanently assessed estates. The total area of Government lands in occupation in 1875-76 was 1,013,000 acres, of which 806,630 were under cultivation. The chief food crops are rice, chοlam Holcus saccharakus), kambu {Ηolcus spicatus), ragt {Eleusine coracana), varagu {Ρasρalum frumentaceum), sarnâi {Panicum mili-accum), and several kinds of pulses. Other crops include oil-seed, [9:15:193] tobacco of excellent quality, and a little indigo and cotton. The rainfall is small and var⅛ble in its. seasons. Every possible means of storing up surplus water has been resorted to from time immemorial. An important engineering project, known as the Periyâr scheme, has long been under consideration, by which the abundant rainfall on the farther slope of the Travancore hills might be diverted into the drainage basin of the Vaigai. Salt is manufactured at certain stations on the coast as a Government monopoly. Handsome turbans fringed with gold cloth, and a peculiar kind of red cloth, are specialities of Madura town. Considerable sea-borne trade is carried on by native craft, chiefly with Ceylon. Rice and other food grains, gingelly oil, spices, cloth, salt fish, tobacco, red ochre, and earthenware ate the principal exports. The district is traversed by the South Indian railway from Tinnevelli to Trichinopoli. The total imperial revenue in 1875-76 amounted to £393,448, of which £280,067 was derived from the land. Education in 1876-77 was afforded by 424 schools, attended by 12,509 pupils. Besides ordinary diseases, Madura possesses three special scourges :— endemic fever, which sometimes rages with exceptional severity; cholera, disseminated by pilgrims to the sacred temple at Râmes-waram; and the well-known “Madura foot.” This last complaint, known to science as morbus pedis entophyticus, is a species of fungus which spreads over the whole foot in a mass of tubercles. Its primary cause seems to be unknown.

History.— Madura was the seat of the Pandian monarchy, which ruled over this part of India from the 5th century b.c. to the end of the 11th century of our era. The last of the Pandia kings is said to have exterminated the Jains, and conquered the neighbouring kingdom of Chola; but he was in his turn overthrown by an invader from the north, conjectured to have been a Mohammedan. In 1324 a Moslem army under Malik Kafur occupied Madura, and the Hindus were held in subjection for a period of fifty years. Subsequently Madura became a province of the Hindu empire of Vijayanagar. In the middle of the 16th century the governor Viswanath established an hereditary rule which lasted for a century. The greatest of the line was Tirumala Nayak (1623-1659), whose magnificence and military exploits are recorded in the contemporary letters of the Jesuit missionaries. He adorned Madura with many public buildings, and extended his empire over the adjoining districts of Tinnevelli, Travancore, Coimbatore, Salem, and Trichinopoli. His repudiation of the nominal allegiance paid to the raja of Vijayanagar brought him into collision with the sultan of Bijapur, and Mohammedans, after the lapse of three centuries, again invaded Madura, and compelled him to pay them tribute. After the death of Tirumala the kingdom of Madura gradually fell to pieces. In 1740 the district fell into the hands of the nawàb of the Carnatic, and the line of the Nâyaks was extinguished. In 1762 British officers took charge of Madura, in trust for Wallah Jah, the last independent nawab of the Carnatic, who finally ceded his rights of sovereignty to the East India Company in 1801.

Madura, the chief town and headquarters of Madura district, is situated on the south bank of the Vaigâi river in 9° 55' 16” N. lat., and 78° 9' 44'' E. long., with a population (1871) of 51,987, being the fourth largest town in the Madras presidency. Its principal architectural feature is the great temple, forming a parallelogram 847 feet by 744 feet, surrounded by nine gopuras, one of which is 152 feet high. The principal structure is the “Hall of a Thousand Pillats” (the actual number being 997). The other buildings comprise the celebrated palace of Tirumala Nâyak, the most perfect relic of secular architecture in Madras. Its ruins cover a large area of ground, and a considerable sum of money has been recently assigned by Government for the restoration of the building. Only second in importance to the palace is the Vasanta or Puthu rnantapam t which still exists in complete preservation, and is said to have been built as a summer retreat for the god Sundareshwara, a form of Siva. On the opposite bank of the river is the Tamakam, a two-storied building of quaint architecture, said to have been erected as a stand from which to view sports and combats. Last is the Teppu-kulam or great tank, situated 1⅜ miles to the east of the town, and measuring 1200 yards each way. Once a year its banks are illuminated by (it is said) 100,000 lamps, while the idols from the pagoda are drawn round it on a teppam or raft.
