MATTING. Under this name are embraced many coarse woven or plaited fibrous materials used for covering floors or furniture, for hanging as screens, for wrapping up heavy merchandise, and for other miscellaneous purposes. In the United Kingdom, under the name of “coir” matting a large amount of a coarse kind of carpet is made from cocoa-nut fibre; and the same material, as well as strips of cane, Manila hemp, various grasses and rushes, is largely employed in various forms for making door mats. Perforated and otherwise prepared india-rubber is also largely utilized for door and floor mats. Matting of various kinds is very extensively employed throughout India for floor coverings, the bottoms of bedsteads, fans and fly-flaps, Ac.; and a considerable export trade in such manufactures is carried on. The materials used are numerous; but the principal substances are straw, the bulrushes Typha elephantina and T. angustifolia, leaves of the date palm {Phoenix sylvestris}, of the dwarf palm (Chamaerops Ritchiana), of the Palmyra palm (Borassus flabelliformis) i of the cocoa-nut[9:15:635] palm (Cocos nucifera), and of the screw pine (Pandanus odoratissimus), the munja or munj grass (Saccharum Munja) and allied grasses, and the mat grasses Cyρerus textilis and C. Pangorei, from the last of which the well-known Palghat mats of the Madras Presidency are made. Many of these Indian grass mats are admirable examples of elegant design, and the colours in which they are woven are rich, harmonious, and effective in the highest degree. Vast quantities of coarse matting used for packing furniture, heavy and coarse goods, and plants, &c., are made in Russia from the bast or inner bark of the lime tree. This industry centres in the great forest governments of Viatka, Nijni-Novgorod, Kostroma, Kazan, Perm, and Simbirsk.
