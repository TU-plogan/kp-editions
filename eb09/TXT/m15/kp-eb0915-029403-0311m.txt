MAIDSTONE, a municipal and parliamentary borough, and the county town of Kent, England, situated almost midway between London and Dover. It lies principally on the eastern bank of the river Medway, the modern part spreading over the western slopes of a picturesque valley, which is intersected and environed by orchards and hop gardens. Although antiquaries have conjectured that Maidstone was a military station of the Romans, few Roman remains have been found in the neighbourhood. The Saxon spelling of the name was Medwegestun, “Medway’s town.” The manor, valued in Domesday Book at £35, 10s., had from a very early period belonged to the see of Canterbury. Archbishop Boniface in 1260 established a hospital here for poor pilgrims, the chapel of which, with modern additions, is again used for public worship. The parish church of St Mary, which had existed from Norman times, was demolished in 1395 by Archbishop Courtenay, who erected on the site thereof the present church of All Saints; he also, at a short distance, founded a college of secular canons, the ruins of which are an interesting specimen of 14th century architecture. From the reign of John until the Reformation the archbishops had here a residence, at which Stafford and Courtenay died; but the existing building known as the palace dates chiefly from Elizabethan times. The rectory, with the manor, passed into lay hands at the Reformation; and, having been a perpetual curacy for three hundred and twenty years, the living became a vicarage in 1866. All Saints is one of the largest parish churches in the kingdom, and contains, besides many excellent monuments, the richly carved sedilia and the twenty-eight oak seats used by the collegiate priests. The parish has, since 1837, been divided into nine ecclesiastical districts, each with a church. The grammar school was founded in 1549, and endowed with the estates of the local Corpus Christi fraternity, then dissolved; the hall in which the guild assembled still remains. Broadcloth and linen thread, introduced by Dutch settlers, were at one time manufactured here; but brewing and papermaking have long superseded these industries. Of the barges trading on the Medway, about sixty belong to Maidstone wharfingers. The river is crossed by a stone bridge of three arches, completed in 1879. A museum, with public library attached, was opened in 1858. The endowed charities yield an annual income of £3000. Since the beginning of the 17th century the Kent assizes have generally been held at Maidstone. From Saxon times down to 1830 condemned malefactors were executed, and all the great county meetings were held, on Penenden Heath, a common situated about a mile north-east of the town, and recently enclosed by the corporation. The area of the municipal borough is 4008 acres, of the parliamentary borough 4576 acres. The population has steadily increased during the present century; in 1801 it was 8027, in 1881 29,632.

With general history Maidstone has been intimately associated. Wat Tyler broke into the prison, liberated John Ball, the rebel preacher, and committed other depredations. Several of the leading inhabitants joined Jack Cade’s rising. Sir Thomas Wyatt, who resided at Allington Castle, now an ivy-clad ruin a mile and a half north of the town, raised the standard of rebellion at Maidstone on 25th January 1554. As a punishment for their complicity with Wyatt, the burgesses were for the next five years deprived of their charter of incorporation. The rising of the Kentish royalists in 1648 collapsed at Maidstone, where, on the 1st June, Fairfax, after five hours’ obstinate fighting, captured the town at midnight. Anciently governed by a portreve, Maidstone was first incorporated by Edward VI., and since the beginning of Elizabeth’s reign it has sent two representatives to parliament. Andrew Broughton, one of its mayors, as clerk of the court which tried Charles I., read the fatal sentence to the king.
