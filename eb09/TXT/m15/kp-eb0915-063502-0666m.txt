MATURIN ', Charles Robert (1782—1824)., novelist and dramatist, perplexed the serious and served as a butt for the more light-minded critics of the first quarter of the 19th century. The bombastic extravagance of his language, the incoherence of his plots, the wild improbability of many of his incidents, the inconsistency of his characters, were obvious and undeniable; but there were so many passages of extraordinary eloquence in his novels, especially in his descriptions of turbulent passion, that, though some pronounced him evidently mad, all admitted that it was a madness allied to genius. At first he published only sermons in his own name, being curate of St Peter’s, Dublin. His first novels, The Fatal Revenge (1804), The Wild Irish Boy (1808), The Milesian Chief (1811), were issued under the pseudonym of Dennis Jasper Murphy. All these were mercilessly ridiculed by the press and neglected by the public, but the irregular power displayed in them attracted the notice of some social and literary magnates; and through the influence of Byron and Scott Maturin’s tragedy of Bertram was produced at Drury Lane in 1816, with a prologue by Hobhouse, an epilogue by the Hon. George Lamb, and with Kean and Miss Kelly in the leading parts. The magnificent scenic situations, and the character of Bertram (like one of Byron’s sombre heroes), make this an effective stage play. It was the first and only success of the author; he returned to “the baffled efforts and the blighted hopes” of which Hobhouse speaks in his prologue. Two more tragedies, Manuel (1817) and Fredolpho (1819), were failures. A poem, The Universe (1821), fell flat. Three novels, Women (1818), Melmoth (1820), and The Albigenses (1824), produced a considerable impression. In the preface to Women he admitted that his previous novels had been justly condemned, being an impossible attempt to revive the exploded style of Mrs Radcliffe, and promised that he would enter on a new vein. But he could not alter his character. The new vein was as wild, fantastic, incoherent, interspersed with passages of really splendid eloquence, as the old. The Albigenses was to be the first of a series of historical romances, illustrating periods of European history, and it was noticed in the Westminster Review as giving, with all its faults, promise of better things; but the author died in the year of its publication.
