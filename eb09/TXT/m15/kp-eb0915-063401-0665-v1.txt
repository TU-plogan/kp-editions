MATTHIAS (1557-1619), holy Roman emperor, the fourth son of the emperor Maximilian II., was born on the 24th of February 1557. He was educated in Germany by the diplomatist Busbecq, while his brother, afterwards the emperor Rudolph II., was trained at the court of Philip II. of Spain. In 1577 Matthias went secretly to the Netherlands, the sovereignty of which he unlawfully assumed; but in 1580 he was compelled to withdraw into private life. He was vain, restless, and ambitious, and intrigued incessantly against the emperor Rudolph, a man of weak character, with a constitutional tendency to insanity. Rudolph passed wholly under the dominion of the Jesuits, and this rendered it easy for Matthias to stir up his Protestant subjects against him. In 1595 Matthias was made regent in Austria, and in 1606 the archdukes recognized him as head of the house of Hapsburg. Rudolph had to relax his hold over one country after another, and in 1611 Matthias was ruler of Hungary, Moravia, Silesia, Lusatia, and even Bohemia, whose loyalty the emperor had tried to secure by many concessions, especially by the letter of majesty granting religious freedom to Protestant sects. In 1612, after the death of Rudolph, Matthias was elected emperor; and his reign was not less disturbed than that of his predecessor. The intervention of Turkey in Transylvania led to war, and in 1615 Matthias, being unsupported by the empire and by his own estates, found that he had no alternative but to conclude peace for twenty years on humiliating terms. Protestants and Catholics, bitterly hating each other, formed respectively the Union and the League; and the rising power of the archduke Ferdinand, afterwards emperor, a bigoted prince who became king of Bohemia in 1617 and king of Hungary in 1618, indicated that even more serious troubles were approaching than those with which Rudolph had contended. In the last two years of the reign of Matthias, the Bohemians having rebelled, the first blows in the Thirty Years’ War were struck. He died on the 20th of March 1619.
