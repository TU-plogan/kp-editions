MANTINEIA was one of the most famous cities of Arcadia. It was situated in the long narrow valley, running north and south, which is now called after the chief town Tripolitza. Tegea was in the same valley, about 10 miles south of Mantineia, and the two cities continually disputed the supremacy of the valley. In every great war we find them ranged on opposite sides, except when superior force constrained both. In the Peloponnesus the disputes between Argos and Sparta listed for centuries; and Mantineia was always an ally of the former. In the war between Sparta and Athens, Mantineia was at first forced to be an ally of Sparta, but in 421 it joined Argos in making an alliance with Athens. The city is said by Strabo to have been founded under Argive instigation, by the union of several villages of the valley; there can be no doubt that this was done in order to maintain a party in the valley hostile to Tegea and Sparta. It is impossible here to trace the varying history of the town. It was one of the chief members of the Arcadian league that helped Epaminondas to break the power of Sparta. It was one of the original members of the Achaean league, but deserted it for the Aetolian. The Achaeans and Antigonus Doson captured the city in 222 B.c., and changed its name to Antigoneia, but the emperor Hadrian restored the ancient name. The worship and mysteries of Cora at Mantineia were famous. The valley in which the city lies has no opening to the coast, and the water finds its way, often only with much care and artificial aid, through underground passages (catabothra) to the sea. It is bounded on the west by Mount Maenalus, on the east by Mount Artemision. The river Ophis flowed through the city. The position of the town in the centre of this valley route made it of great military importance, and five important battles were fought beside it: in 418 B.c. Sparta defeated the alliance above mentioned; in 362 Epaminondas defeated the Spartans and lost his own life; in 295 Demetrius Poliorcetes defeated the Spartans; in 242 Aratus defeated the Spartans; in 207 Philopoemen defeated the Spartans. In the beginning of the 4th century b.c. Mantineia had 3000 citizens capable of bearing arms.
