MASSA, or, to distinguish it from several places of the same name, Massa Carrara, a city of Italy, the chief town of the province of Massa, lies on the left bank of the Frigido, a small stream falling into the Gulf of Genoa about 3 miles lower down. It is 78∣ miles south-east of Genoa by rail, and 26 miles north of Pisa. The ancient part of the city stands on a hill. Among the objects of interest it is sufficient to mention the old ducal palace, the new cathedral (erected instead of the building destroyed by Elisa Bacciocchi because it interfered with the view from the palace windows), the technical school, and the academy of science and literature, originally known as Dei Derelitti. Like Carrara, Massa is largely engaged in the marble trade; it also manufactures silk, oil, and paper. The population of the city was 4786 in 1871; that of the commune was 15,017 in 1861 and 18,031 in 1881.

Massa is first mentioned in the 9th century. About the close of the 10th it was bestowed by Otho the Great on the bishops of Luni, and in consequence it came to be distinguished for a time as Massa Lunense. From the bishops it passed to the marquises of Luni (hence Massa del Marchese), and more particularly to a branch of the Malaspina family. After a period in which Lucca, Pisa, the Visconti, the Fieschi, and others were successively in possession it returned, under Florentine protection, to Alberico Malaspina, and finally through the marriage of Ricciarda Malaspina with Lorenzo Cybo became (1519) Massa Cybea. Raised under Alberico Cybo from being little better than a feudal village to the rank of a fortified town, Massa was in 1568 made the capital of a principality by Maximilian II., and in 1664 the capital of a duchy by Leopold I. By the marriage of Maria Teresa dei Cybei with Duke Ercole III. of Modena it passed to the Este family; and after the period of the French Revolution, during which it formed part of the duchy of Lucca assigned to Napoleon’s sister and brother-in-law, it was restored by tlιe congress of Vienna to Beatrice, duchess of Modena. Massa was made an episcopal see only in 1828, though the design of giving it this dignity had been entertained and almost realized in 1757. The total area of the duchy of Massa and Carrara was 62 square miles, of which 35 belonged to Massa.
