MAZANDARÁN, a province of northern Persia, lying between the Caspian Sea and the Elbùrz range, and bounded E. and W. by the provinces of Astrâbâd and Gilân respectively, is 220 miles in length and 60 miles in (mean) breadth, with an area of about 10,000 square miles and a population estimated at from 150,000 to 200,000. Mazandarân comprises two distinct natural regions presenting the sharpest contrasts in their relief, climate, and products. In the north the Caspian is encircled by the level and swampy lowlands, varying in breadth from 10 to 30 miles, partly under impenetrable jungle, partly under rice, cotton, sugar, and other crops. This section is fringed northwards by the sandy beach of the Caspian, here almost destitute of natural härbours, and rises somewhat abruptly inland to the second section, comprising the northern slopes and spurs of the Elbùrz, which approach at some points within 1 or 2 miles of the sea, and which are almost everywhere covered with dense forest. The lowlands, rising but a few feet above the Caspian, and subject to frequent floodings, are extremely malarious, while the highlands, culminating with the magnificent Damâvand (18,600 feet), enjoy a tolerably salubrious climate. But the climate, generally hot and moist in summer, is everywhere capricious and liable to sudden changes of temperature, whence the prevalence of rheumatism, dropsy, and especially ophthalmia, noticed by all travellers. Snow falls heavily on the uplands, where it often lies for weeks on the ground. The direction of the long sandbanks at the river mouths, which project with remarkable uniformity from west to east, shows that the prevailing winds blow from the west and north-west. The rivers themselves, of which there are as many as fifty, are little more than mountain torrents, all rising on the northern slopes of Elbιιrz, flowing mostly in independent channels to the Caspian, and subject to sudden freshets and inundations along their lower course. The chief are the Safed-rud on the Gilân frontier, the Lâr, Hari-rùd, Alain-nid, Rùstam-nid, and Hârez, and all are well stocked with trout, mullet (safed mâhi), carp, sturgeon, and other fish, which with rice form the staple food of the inhabitants, and supply large quantities of caviare for the Russian market. Near their mouths the rivers, running counter to the prevailing winds and waves of the Caspian, form long sand-hills 20 to 30’feet high and about 200 yards broad, behind which are developed the so-called murd-db, or “dead waters,” stagnant "pools and swamps characteristic of this coast, and a chief cause of its unhealthiness.

The province abounds in iron ores and in mineral pitch in every state of transition from pure petroleum to the finest naphtha. The chief cultivated plants are rice, cotton, sugar, a little silk, and fruits in great variety, including several kinds of the orange, lemon, and citron. Some of the slope⅜ are covered with extensive thickets of the pomegranate, and the wild vine climbs to a great height round the trunks of the forest trees. These woodlands are haunted by the tiger, panther, bear, wolf, and wild boar in considerable numbers. Of the domestic animals, all remarkable for their small size, the chief are the black, humped cattle somewhat resembling the Indian variety, the yabu (a sturdy breed of horses), and sheep and goats.

Kinneir, Frazer, and other observers speak unfavourably of the Mazandarâni people, whom they describe as very ignorant and bigoted, arrogant, rudely inquisitive, and almost insolent towards strangers. Tlιe peasantry, however, although called the “Boeotians of Persia,” are far from dull, and betray much shrewdness where their interests are concerned. In the healthy districts they are stout and well made, and are the most warlike race in Persia, furnishing 5000 cavalry and 12,000 foot to the Government. Of the latter 2000 are always in attendance on the shah at Tehran. They speak a marked and somewhat rude Persian dialect; but a Tùrki idiom closely akin to the Turkoman is still current amongst the foreign tribes, although they have mostly already passed from the nomad to the settled state. Of these intruders the most numerous are the Modaunlιi, Khojehvand, and Abdul Maleki, originally of Lek or Kurd stock, besides branches of the royal Afshar and Kâjâr tribes of Tιirki descent. All these are exempt from taxes in consideration of their military service.

The export trade is chiefly with Russia through Baku, where broadcloths, flour, saffron, and bar iron are taken in exchange for the white and coloured calicoes, caviare, rice, and raw cotton of Mazandaran. Owing to the almost impenetrable character of the country, there are scarcely any roads accessible to wheeled carriages, and the great causeway of Shah Abbas has in many places even disappeared under the jungle. Two routes, however, lead to Tehran, one by Firoz Koh, 180 miles long, the other by Larijân, 144 miles long, both in tolerably good repair. Except where crossed by these routes the Elbιirz forms an almost impassable barrier to the south.

The administration is in the hands of the prince governor, who appoints most of the beglerbegs and governors of .the nine districts of Am<jl, Bârfarôsh, Mashhad-i-Sar, Sari, Ashraf, Farah-âbâd, Tennacorben, Kellauristak, and Kiijùr into which the province is divided. There is fair security for life and property; and, although otherwise indifferently administered, the country is quite free from marauders or local disturbances. The revenue is about 105,000 tomans, of which nothing goes to the state treasury, all being required, for the governors, troops, pensions, and police. The capital is Sari, the other chief towns being Bârfarôsh, Mashhad-i-Sar, Ashraf, and Farah-âbâd.
