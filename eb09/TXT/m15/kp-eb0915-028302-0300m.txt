MAGNUS, Heinrich Gustav (1802-1870), an eminent German chemist and physicist, was born at Berlin May 2, 1802. He early showed a strong scientific bias, which was well fostered and strengthened by his education. Six years of thorough study at Berlin university were supplemented by a year’s course at Stockholm in Berzelius’s laboratory (1828). After some time spent in Paris under Gay-Lussac and Thénard, Magnus settled at Berlin in 1831 as lecturer on technology and physics in the university. In 1834 he was elected extraordinary and in 1845 ordinary professor of these subjects. He died April 4,1870. His numerous papers, which appeared chiefly in Poggendorffs Annalen and in the publications of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, cover a wide range of chemical and physical subjects. His first memoir, published in 1825, while he was yet a student, was a discussion of the spontaneous inflammability of finely divided iron, nickel, and cobalt. From 1827 to 1833 he was occupied mainly with chemical researches, which resulted in the discovery of sulphovinic, ethionic, and isethionic acids and their salts, and, in conjunction with Ammermüller, of periodic acid. The absorption of gases in blood (1837-45), the expansion of gases by heat (1841-44), the vapour pressures of water and various solutions (1844-54), thermo-electricity (1851), electrolysis (1856), induction of currents (1858-61), conduction of heat in gases (1860), and polarization of heat (1866-68) are some of the many subjects of which he treated. From 1861 onwards he devoted much attention to the still vexed question of diathermancy in gases and vapours, especially to the behaviour in this respect of dry and moist air, and to the thermal effects produced by the condensation of moisture on solid surfaces. Many of his papers were translated and published in the Philosophical Magazine.
