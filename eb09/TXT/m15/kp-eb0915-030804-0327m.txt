MAITTAIRE, Michel (1668-1747), bibliographer and editor, was a. native of France, and was born in 1668. On the revocation of the edict of Nantes his parents, who were Protestants, removed to England, where he was educated at Westminster and at Christ Church, Oxford, graduating in 1696. From 1695 to 1699 he taught in Westminster School, but afterwards devoted himself exclusively to private teaching and editorial work. He died on August 4, 1747.

His works include De Graecae Linguae Dialectis, 1706; Stephanorum Historia, vitas ipsorum et libros complectens, 1713; Historia Typographorum [9:15:309] aliquot Parisiensium, vitas et libros complectens, 1717; Annales Typographic^, 9 vols. 4to, The Hague, Amsterdam, and London, 1719-41; Marmora Oxoniensia, 1732; editions of a large number of Latin authors (Lucretius, Phaedrus, Sallust, Terence, &c.), as well as an edition of Anacreon (1725), and Miscellanea Graecorum aliquot scriptorum Carmina, 1722.
