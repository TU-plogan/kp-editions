MAULMAIN, or Moulmein, a town in Amherst district, British Burmah, situated on the left bank of the Salwin river, in 16° 30' N. lat. and 97° 38' E. long. At the time of the cession of this part of the province to the British in 1826, Maulmain was a mere waste. It has now developed into a thriving commercial town, ranking next to Rangoon in importance, with a rapidly increasing population and trade. The population, which in 1857 was 23,683, had increased in 1872 to 46,472, and in 1881 to 53,107 (32,895 males and 20,212 females). The principal buildings are Salwin House, originally a private residence, but now the property of the municipality, the hospital, the jail» Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, the custom-house, and other public offices, and the barracks for the garrison of Madras native infantry. For many years timber formed the only export, but with the gradual settlement of the country and increase in agriculture rice and cotton began to be also exported; besides these, the other staple exports are hides, horns, lead, copper, yellow orpiment, and stick-lac. The principal imports are cotton twist and cloth, woollen piece-goods, wines and spirits, sugar, and betel-nuts. In 1880-81 573 vessels (266,010 tons) entered the port, and 536 (265,147 tons) cleared. The value of merchandise imported was £666,810, of treasure £312,190, of merchandise exported £1,389,763, and of treasure £92,817. Shipbuilding forms an important industry of the town.
