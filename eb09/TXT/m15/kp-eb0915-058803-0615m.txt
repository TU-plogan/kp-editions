MARUTSE-MABUNDA, a kingdom in South Africa, stretching from 18° to 14° 25' S. lat. and from about 22° ∣to 28° 25' E. long., with an area estimated at 123,590 square miles. It all belongs to the basin of the Zambesi, and by far the greater proportion lies to the north of that river, which forms its south-eastern boundary from the mouth of the Linyanti to the mouth of the Kafue, a distance of about 350 miles. The kingdom thus includes the main part of the territory formerly subject to the Makololo empire, which broke up on the death of Sekeletu in 1864. Of country and people Dr Holub gives a very favourable report. Abundance of water, a fertile soil, and a genial climate render easy the work both of husbandry and cattle-breeding. The chief crop is Kaffre corn, red and white; the hemp-like kleen-korn or rosa, maize, watermelons, sugar-cane, ground-nuts, two kinds of beans, and manza are also cultivated. “September and October are the usual months for sowing; but gourds, leguminous plants, and tobacco are sown any time up to December, the growth of the two latter crops being so rapid that they often ripen by January, whilst Kaffre corn and maize are ready by February.” Upwards of fifty kinds of wild fruit are used by the people as food. Salt has to be imported, and is consequently within the reach only of the wealthier classes. Besides the two great tribes which give their name to the kingdom, there are a large number of vassal tribes of numerical importance—Masupias, Matongas, Makalakas—all considered in the light of slaves by the rulers. The prevailing language is the Sesuto of the nearly extirpated Makololos. See Holub, Seven Years in South Africa, 1881.
