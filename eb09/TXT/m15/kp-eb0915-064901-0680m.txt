MAYER, Johann Tobias (1723-1762), one of the greatest of last century’s astronomers, was born at Marbach in Würtemberg, February 17, 1723. He was brought up at Esslingen in comparatively poor circumstances, and as a mathematician was mainly self-taught. He had already published several original geometrical tracts when, in 1746, he entered Homann’s cartographic establishment at Nuremberg. Here he introduced many improvements in map-making, and gained a scientific reputation which led (in 1751) to his election to the chair of economy and mathematics in the university of Göttingen. In 1754 he became superintendent of the observatory, where he laboured with great zeal and success till his death, February 20, 1762. His first important astronomical work was a careful investigation of the libration of the moon (Kosmo-graphische Nachrichten, Nuremberg, 1750), the elements of which and the position of the moon’s axis of rotation he determined with much greater accuracy than had previously been done. His great fame rests on his lunar tables, which were published in 1753 along with new solar tables, and transmitted to England in 1755. These tables, which were compared by Bradley with the Greenwich observations, and found to be sufficiently accurate to determine the longitude at sea to within half a degree, solved the problem of practically determining longitude anywhere on the earth’s surface. An improved set was afterwards published in London (1770), as also the theory (Theoria Lunae juxta Systema Newtonianum, 1767) upon which the tables are based. They were sent to England by his widow, who in consideration received from the British Government a grant of £3000. Appended to the London edition of the solar and lunar tables are two short tracts, —the one on determining longitude by lunar distances, together with a description of the repeating circle (invented by Mayer in 1760), the other on a formula for atmospheric refraction, which applies a remarkably accurate correction for temperature.

Mayer left behind him a considerable quantity of manuscript, part of which was collected by Lichtenberg and published in one volume (Opera Inedita, Gottingen, 1775). It contains, amongst other papers, an easy and accurate method for calculating eclipses; an essay on colour, in which three primary colours are recognized; a catalogue of nine hundred and ninety-eight zodiacal stars; and a memoir, the earliest of any real value, on the proper motion of fixed stars, which was originally communicated to the Gottingen Royal Society in 17 60. The other part still remains in manuscript, and includes papers on atmospheric refraction (dated 1755), on the motion of Mars as affected by the perturbations of Jupiter and the Earth (1756), andon terrestrial magnetism (1760 and 1762). In these last Mayer seeks to explain the magnetic action of the earth by a simple hypothesis. He supposes a small bar-magnet to be placed with its centre at the earth’s centre, and calculates the position of equilibrium of a second small magnet at any given point on the earth’s surface, assuming the law of magnetic attraction and repulsion to be that of the inverse square. Though the values of the declination and dip calculated according to this theory do not agree with the observed values, Mayer must be credited with the first really definite attempt to establish a mathematical theory of magnetic action, and as the first who gave any experimental evidence in favour of the inverse square of the distance as the law of force.
