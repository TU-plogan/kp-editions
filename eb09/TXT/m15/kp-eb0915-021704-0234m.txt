MAGNESIA, in aucient geography, was the name of two cities in Asia Minor, both of considerable interest and importance.

(1) A city of Ionia, situated on a small stream flowing into the valley of the Maeander, whence it was commonly called Magnesia ad Maeandrum. It was distant 120 stadia or 15 Roman miles from Miletus, and rather less from Ephesus. According to tradition, as well as the similarity of names, it was founded by a body of colonists from the Thessalian tribe of the Magnetes, with whom were associated, according to Strabo, some Cretan settlers. It was thus not properly an Ionic city, and for this reason apparently was not included among the cities of the Ionic league, though superior in wealth and prosperity to most of them, except Ephesus and Miletus. It was indeed taken and destroyed by the Cimmerians in their irruption into Asia Minor (about 660 b.c. ), but was soon after rebuilt, and gradually recovered its former prosperity. It was one of the towns assigned by Artaxerxes to Themistocles for his support in his exile, and there the latter ended his days (449 b.c. ). In later times it was chiefly noted for its temple of Artemis Leucophryne, which, according to Strabo, surpassed that at Ephesus in the beauty of its architecture, though inferior to it in size and wealth. The remains of this temple, as well as of the ancient city adjoining it, are still extant, and have been laid open by recent excavations. They are described by M. Texier (Asie Mineure, vol iiι). Magnesia continued under the kings of Pergamum to be one of the most flourishing cities in this part of Asia, but appears to have gradually declined under the Roman empire, and its name disappears from history, though its continued existence is attested by coins as late as the time of Gallienus.

(2) A city of Lydia, about 40 miles north-east of Smyrna, which stood on the southern bank of the river Hermus, at the foot of Mount Sipylus, from which circumstance it was often called for distinction’s sake Magnesia ad Sipylum. It is probable from its name that it was founded, like the city of the same name in the valley of the Maeander, by Magnesian colonists from Thessaly; but we have no authority for the fact. Nor is any mention of the town found in history till 190 b.c., when the Syrian king, Antiochus the Great, was defeated under its walls by the Roman consul I.. Scipio, who derived from his success in this campaign the surname of Asiaticus. Magnesia became a city of importance under the Roman dominion, and, though nearly destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of Tiberius, was restored by that emperor, and continued to flourish throughout the period of the Roman empire. It was one of the few towns in this part of Asia Minor that retained its prosperity under the Turkish rule; and Manisa (q.v.) is at the present day a large and flourishing town with considerable trade.
