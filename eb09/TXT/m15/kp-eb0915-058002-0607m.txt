MARTIGUES, chief place of a canton in the department of Bouches-du-Rhône, France, stands on the southern shore of the lagoon of Berre, and at the eastern extremity of that of Caronte, by which the former is connected with the Mediterranean. Divided into three quarters by canals with numerous bridges, the place has sometimes been called the Venice of Provence. It has a harbour of 10 acres, an iron foundry, workshops for maritime constructions, oil manufactures, and chemical works; the principal industry, however, consists in the preparation of “boutargue,” which is obtained from the roes of the grey mullet caught in the lagoons, and rivals Russian caviare. The population in 1876 was 8053.

Built in 1232 by Raymond Bérenger, count of Provence, Martigues was made a viscountsliip by Joanna I., queen of Naples. Henry IV. made it a principality, in favour of a princess of the house of Luxembourg. It afterwards passed into the hands of the duke of Villars.
