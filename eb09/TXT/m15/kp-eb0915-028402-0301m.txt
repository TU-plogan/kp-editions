MAGO was one of the most common Carthaginian names, borne among others by the reputed founder of the military power of Carthage, and the Punic admiral in the war with the elder Dionysius (see Carthage). The most famous of the name was the youngest of the three sons of Hamilcar Barca. He accompanied his brother Hannibal on his expedition into Italy, and held important commands in the great victories of the first three years. After the battle of Cannae he marched through southern Italy and sailed to Carthage to report the successes gained. He was about to return to Italy with strong reinforcements for Hannibal, when the Government ordered him to go to help his other brother, Hasdrubal, who was hard pressed in Spain. He maintained war there with varying success in concert with the two generals Hasdrubal, until, in 209 b.c., his brother marched into Italy to help Hannibal. Mago remained in Spain with the other Hasdrubal. In 207 he was defeated by Μ. Silanus, and in 206 the combined forces of Mago and Hasdrubal were scattered by Scipio in the decisive battle of Silpia. Mago maintained himself for a long time in Gades, but afterwards received orders to carry the war into Liguria. He wintered in the Balearic Isles, where the fine harbour Portus Magonis, Port Mahon, still bears his name. Early in 204 he landed in Liguria, where he maintained a desultory warfare till in 203 he was defeated in Cisalpine Gaul by the Roman forces. He received orders soon after to return to Carthage, but on the voyage home he died of wounds received in the battle.

The name of Mago—but which Mago is uncertain—is attached to a great work on agriculture which was brought to Rome and translated by order of the senate after the destruction of Carthage. The book was regarded as a standard authority, and is often referred to by later writers.
