MEININGEN, the capital of the little duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, in central Germany, and the seat of the provincial courts for Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg, and the Prussian districts of Schmalkalden and Schleusingen, is situated on the right bank of the Werra, about 40 miles to the south of Eisenach. It consists of an old town and several handsome suburbs, but much of the former has been rebuilt in a modern style since a destructive fire in 1874. The chief buildings are the Elisabethenburg, or old ducal palace, dating chiefly from 1682, and containing several collections; the new palace; the new town-house; the post-office; the barracks; and the old town church, with its two towers, erected in 1003. The theatre has lately attained a European reputation for its admirably drilled actors and unexcelled scenic effects. The English Garden, a beautiful public park, contains the ducal mortuary chapel and several monuments. The industries, consisting of brewing and the weaving of woollen and cotton cloth, are insignificant. The population in 1880 was 11,227.

Meiningen, which was subject to the bishops of Würzburg for upwards of 500 years (1000-1542), came into the possession of the dukes of Saxony in 1583. At the partition of 1660 it fell to the share of Saxe-Altenburg, and in 1680 it became the capital of Saxe-Meiningen.
