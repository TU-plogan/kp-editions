MEATH, a maritime county of Ireland, in the province of Leinster, is bounded E. by the Irish Sea, S.E. by Dublin, S. by Kildare and King’s county, W. by Westmeath, N. W. by Cavan and Monaghan, and N.E. by Louth. Its greatest length north and south is about 40 miles, and its breadth east and west about 45 miles. The total area comprises 578,247 acres, or 904 square miles.

The county forms part of the great limestone plain that occupies the central portion of Ireland. In some districts the surface is variegated by hills and swells, which to the west reach a considerable elevation, although the general features of a fine champaign country are never lost. The coast, which is low and shelving, extends to about 10 miles, but there is no harbour of importance. The Boyne, whose banks are specially beautiful, enters the county at its south-west extremity, and flowing north-east to Drogheda divides it into two almost equal parts. At Navan it receives the Blackwater, which flows south-west from Cavan. The Boyne is navigable for barges as far as Navan, where a canal is carried to Trim. The Royal Canal passes along the southern boundary of the county to Dublin. There are no lakes of importance.

Climate and Agriculture.— The climate is genial and favourable for all kinds of crops, there being less rain than even in the neighbouring counties. The principal substratum is limestone, but there are some districts of clay slate. Except a small portion occupied by the Bog of z∖llen, the county is very verdant and fertile. The soil is principally a rich deep loam resting on limestone gravel, but varies from a strong clayey loam to a light sandy gravel.

The total number of holdings in 1881 was 11,867, of which 1632 were less than 1 acre in extent, and 4300 between 5 and 15 acres. Only 93 were above 500 acres. According to the agricultural statistics for 1881, the area of arable land was 532,708 acres, or 92 - 4 per cent, of the whole area of the county, while 9599 acres were under plantations, 11,260 bog and marsh, and 201 barren mountain land. Of the arable land, 60,411 were under tillage, 85,893 meadow and clover, and 386,374 pasture. The following table shows the area under the different crops in 1855 and 1882 :—

Horses between 1855 and 1882 have diminished from 23,310 to 15,316, an average of 2 ’ 9 to every 100 acres under cultivation, the average for Ireland being 3 - 2. Cattle in 1855 numbered 135,485, and in 1882 had increased to 176,121, an average of 33 to every 100 acres under cultivation, the average for Ireland being 26 - 2. Sheep in 1855 numbered 170,582, and in 1882 only 146,749, although in 1880 they were 174,573. Pigs in 1882 numbered 19,709, goats 6398, and poultry 318,968.

According to the latest return the land was divided among 1322 proprietors, who possessed 577,846 acres, with a total annual value of £544,550. The average size of the properties was 436 acres, and the average annual value per acre was 18s. 10d. The following four proprietors possessed more than 10,000 acres each: viz., Earl of Darnley, 21,858 acres; J. I.. Naper, 18,863; Marquis of Lansdowne, 12,995; and Lord Athlumney, 10,213.

Manufactures.— Almost the sole industry of the county is [9:15:669] agriculture, but coarse linen is woven by hand-looms, and there are a few woollen manufactories.

Railways.— The Dublin and Meath line intersects the county in a north-westerly direction, and separates into several branches, while the Great Western line skirts the southern boundary.

Administration and Population.— The county includes 18 baronies, 146 parishes, and 1626 townlands. Assizes are held at Trim, and quarter sessions at Dunshauglin, Duleek, Kells, Navan, and Trim. Two poor-law unions, Navan and Trim, are wholly within the county, and parts of Ardee, Celbridge, Drogheda, Dunshauglin, Edenderry, Kells, and Old Castle. It is in the Dublin military district, subdistrict of Birr, with barrack stations at Navan and Trim. Ecclesiastically it is in the Meath diocese, with portions in Armagh and Kilmore. Previous to the Union it sent fourteen members to parliament, but now only the two members for the county are returned.

From 81,516 in 1760 the population in 1821 had increased to 159,183, and in 1841 to 183,828, but by 1851 had diminished to 140,768, in 1871 to 95,558, and in 1881 to 87,469, of whom 44,315 were males and 43,154 females. The principal towns are Navan, 3873; Kells, 2822; and Trim, 1586. A portion of the parliamentary borough of Drogheda, including 933 of the inhabitants, is also within the county. The number of births in the county during the ten years ending 3d March 1881 was 21,293, an average of 23’3 to every 1000 of the population; of deaths 16,878, an average of 18‘4; of marriages 3165, an average of 3'5; and of emigrants 10,521, an average of 12’1. From 1st May 1851 to 3d March 1881 the total number of emigrants was 49,375. Of the population five years old and upwards in 1881, 22 ’ 7 per cent, were illiterate, the percentage in 1871 being 29 - 9. In 1881 there were 3531 persons able to speak Irish, but none were unable to speak English.

History and Antiquities.— According to Ptolemy, Meath was originally inhabited by the Eblani, whose territory extended from the Boyne to the Liffey. A district known as Meath, and including the present county of Meath as well as Westmeath and Longford, with parts of Cavan, Kildare, and King’s county, was in the 2d century formed by Tuathal into a kingdom to serve as mensal land of the Ard Ré or over-king. Afterwards it was divided into Oireamlιain, now known as Meath, and Eireamhain, which included the remainder of the old kingdom. The district was frequently subject to invasions from the Danes; they were totally defeated at Tara in 980. About 800,000 acres, including all the present county of Meath, was granted by Henry II. to IIugh de Lacy.

The most remarkable antiquarian remains are two round towers, the one at Kells, and the other in the churchyard of Donoughmore, near Navan. At New Grange, near Slane, there is an artificial cavern of a very peculiar construction. A large rath on Tara hill was the meeting-place of the princes before the Danish invasion, and the seat of a royal palace referred to in the well-known lines of Moore. A stone on the top of the rath is supposed by some to be the stone of destiny where the ancient monarchs of Ireland were crowned. Monastic buildings were very numerous, among the more important ruins being those of Duleek, which is said to have been the first ecclesiastical edifice in Ireland built of stone and mortar; the extensive remains of Bective; and those of Clonard, where also were a cathedral and a very famous college. Of the old fortresses, Trim Castle on the Boyne still presents an imposing appearance. There are also many fine old mansions.
