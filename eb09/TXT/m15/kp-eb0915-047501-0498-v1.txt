MANDI, a native state in the Punjab, India, lying between 31° 23' 45" and 32° 4' N. lat., and between 76° 40' and 77° 22' 30" E. long., and bounded on the N. and E. by Kullu, on the S. by Suket, and on the W. by Kângrâ. The country is very mountainous, being intersected by two great parallel ranges, reaching to an average height of from 5000 to 7000 feet above sea. The valleys between the hill ranges are very fertile, and produce all the ordinary grains, besides more valuable crops of rice, maize, sugarcane, poppy, and tobacco. Salt-mines contribute about one-third of the state revenue. Iron is found in places, and also gold in small quantities. The area of the state is estimated at about 1200 square miles, and a census in 1881 gives the population as 147,017. The chief, a Räjput by caste, enjoys an approximate income of <£36,500, and the state pays a tribute to the British Government of £10,000 a year. Mandi town, the capital, is situated on the Biâs, in 31° 43' N. lat. and 76° 58' E. long.
