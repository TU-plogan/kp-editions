MASON, George Hemming (1818-1872), A.R.A., was born at Whitley, in 1818, the eldest son of a Staffordshire county gentleman. Intended for the medical profession, he studied for five years under Dr Watt of Birmingham; but he had no taste for science; all his thoughts were given to art. In 1844 he abandoned medicine and travelled for a time on the Continent, visiting France, Germany, and Switzerland, and finally settling in Rome. His pencil was busy with the picturesque scenery that surrounded him, and with hardly any instruction, except that received from nature and from the Italian pictures that met his eye, he gradually acquired the painter’s skill At least two important works are referable to this period,— Ploughing in the Campagna, shown in the Royal Academy of 1857, and In the Salt Marshes, Campagna, exhibited in the following year. After Mason’s return from the Continent, in 1858, when he settled at Wetley Abbey, he continued to paint Italian subjects from studies made during his foreign tour, and then his art began to touch, in a wonderfully tender and poetic way, the peasant life of his native England, and especially of his native Staffordshire, and the homely landscape in the midst of which that life was set. The first picture of this class was Wind on the Wolds, and it was followed—along with much else—by the painter’s three greatest works—the Evening Hymn, 1868, a band of Staffordshire mill-girls, seen, their figures dark against the sunset, returning from their work, singing as they walk; Girls Dancing by the Sea, 1869; and the Harvest Moon, 1872. Mason had long suffered from heart disease, which carried him off on the 22d of October 1872. In his work he laboured under the double disadvantage of feeble and uncertain health, and a want of thorough arttraining, and consequently his pictures were never produced easily, or without strenuous and long-continued effort. His art is great in virtue of the solemn pathos which pervades it, of the dignity and beauty which it reveals in rustic life, of its keen perception of noble form and graceful motion and of rich effects of colour and subdued light. In motif and treatment it has most in common with the art of Millet and Jules Breton, and of Frederick Walker among Englishmen. An interesting collection of Mason’s pictures was brought together by the Burlington Club shortly after his death.
