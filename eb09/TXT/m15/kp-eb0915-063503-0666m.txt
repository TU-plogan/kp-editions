MAUBEUGE, a fortified place of northern France, situated on both banks of the Sambre, 142 miles by rail north-east from Paris, and about 2 miles from the Belgian frontier. Its fortifications were planned by Vauban; the enceinte is pierced by two gateways, that of France and that of Mons. Maubeuge, besides containing an arsenal and several old convents, is an industrial town, manufacturing swords, files, axles, tools, hardware, machinery, porcelain tiles, and paper; in the neighbourhood there are numerous forges. The population in 1876 was 14,400.

Maubeuge owes its origin to a double monastery for men and women founded in the 7th century by St Aldegonde. It was burnt by the Normans, by Louis XI., by Francis I., and by Henry II., and was finally assigned to France by the treaty of Nimeguen. It was fortified by Vauban at the command of Louis XIV., who first saw military service there, under Turenne. Besieged in 1793 by the prince of Coburg, it was relieved by the victory of Wattignies. It was unsuccessfully besieged by the duke of Saxe-Weimar in 1814, but was compelled to capitulate, after a vigorous resistance, in the following year.
