MANSFIELD, a market-town in the county of Nottingham, England, is situated in Sherwood Forest, near the north bank of the river Mann or Maun, 17 miles north-west from Nottingham, and 140 north-north-west of London by rail. The town is built of stone, with regular streets radiating from the market place, and several good houses. The church of St Peter is partly Early Norman and partly Perpendicular. There is a grammar school founded by Q ιeen Elizabeth in 1561, for which new buildings have lately been erected at a cost of ^10,000. Twelve almshouses were founded by Elizabeth Heath in 1693, and to these six were afterwards added. In addition there are a number of other charities. The other principal buildings are the town-hall, the mechanics’ institute, and the public baths. In the market place there is a monument to I. >rd George Bentinck. The industries of the town are the manufacture of lace thread, cotton hose, machines, engines, and bricks and tiles, iron-founding, and brewing.

In the neighbourhood there are quarries of limestone, sandstone, and freestone. Population in 1871, 11,824; in 1881, 13,651.

From coins found at Mansfield and the remains of a Roman villa in the neighbourhood, it is believed to have been a Roman station. During the heptarchy it was occasionally the residence of the Mercian kings, and it was afterwards a favourite resort of Norman sovereigns. By Henry VIII. the manor was granted to the earl of Surrey. Afterwards it went by exchange to the duke of Newcastle, and from the Newcastles to the Portland family. The town obtained a fair from Richard II. in 1377.
