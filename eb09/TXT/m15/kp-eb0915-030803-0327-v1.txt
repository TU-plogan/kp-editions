MAITLAND, William (c. 1525-1573), best known in Scottish history by the name of his father’s estate of Lethington, near Haddington, where he resided, was the eldest son of Sir Richard Maitland, noticed above. Born about 1525, and partly educated in France, he was at an early age initiated-into public life. He was made secretary of state by Mary of Guise in 1558; but the favour with which he regarded the views of the reforming party soon exposed him to the queen mother’s resentment. He became one of the “lords of the congregation,” and was also one of the Scottish commissioners who negotiated with Queen Elizabeth regarding the terms on which she would agree to aid the Reformers. Soon after Mary’s arrival in Scotland, he was employed in two embassies to England, and was made first an extraordinary and then an ordinary lord of session. He had a controversy with Knox, whom he accused in the General Assembly of 1564 of teaching seditious doctrine. He went again to England as ambassador to notify the queen’s marriage to Darnley, and was implicated both in the conspiracy against Rizzio and in the Kirk of Field tragedy, though he was also a member of the secret council at which the depositions of Darnley’s murderers were taken, and signed the act of council accusing Mary of being the author of the crime. He fought against the queen at Langside, but at the conference at York identified himself in a measure with her interests. At the instance of the regent Murray he was in 1569 arrested as a participant in the king’s murder, and would have been brought to trial but for a ruse of Kirkcaldy of Grange, who, as commander of Edinburgh Castle, conveyed him thither as a prisoner. The two principal representatives of Mary’s cause, Lethington and Grange, who may be described as the forlorn hope of the captive queen, held the castle of Edinburgh for some time against the regent Morton and an English force; and, when surrender became a matter of necessity, they made their submission, not to the regent, but to the English queen. Kirkcaldy was executed; but Maitland died in prison, it was generally believed of poison administered by his own hand, on 9th June 1573. “Secretary Maitland” was a man of great learning and power of repartee, wanting in integrity, but skilled in intrigue, and reputed the most accomplished and most versatile statesmen that his country has produced; in the opinion of his contemporaries his capacities were too great for the narrow sphere of Scottish politics.
