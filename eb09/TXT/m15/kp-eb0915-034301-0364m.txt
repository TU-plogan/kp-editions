MALTE-BRUN, Conrad, a distinguished geographer, was born August 12, 1755, at Thysted in Denmark, and died at Paris, December 14, 1826. His real name was Malte Conrad Bruun, and it was not till he settled in France that he became known by the more familiar form. While a student at Copenhagen, he made himself famous partly by his verses, but much more by the violence of his political pamphleteering; and at length, in 1800, the legal actions which the Government authorities had from time to time instituted against him culminated in a sentence of perpetual banishment. The principles which he had advocated were those of the French Revolution, and, though he at first sought asylum in Sweden, before long he found his way to Paris. There he looked forward to a political career; but, when Napoleon’s personal ambition began to unfold itself, Malte Brun was bold enough to protest, and to turn elsewhere for employment and advancement. He was associated with Mentelle and Herbin in the compilation of their Géographie mathématique . . de toutes les parties du Monde (Paris, 1803-7, 16 vols.), and before many years he was recognized as one of the best geographers of France. He is remembered, not only as the author of six volumes of the learned Précis de géographie universelle, continued afteι his death by other hands, but also as the originator of the Annales des Voyages (1808), and the principal founder of the Geographical Society of Paris.
