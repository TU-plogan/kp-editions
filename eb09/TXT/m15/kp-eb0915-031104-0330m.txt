MAK ̣RÍZÍ. Taki el-Din Ahmed ibn ‘Alf el Makrizi (1364^[1. The year of his birth is variously given as 760, 766, 769 a.h.; but 766 A.H. (1364 a.d.) is the date best authenticated. ]-1441), one of the most meritorious of Arabic historians and archaeologists, was descended on both sides from families of scholarly distinction. His hereditary surname of Makrizi, by which he is usually known, was derived from Makriz, a suburb of Ba'lbek, with which town his paternal ancestors had been connected. Taki el-Din himself was born in Cairo, and spent his life mainly in Egypt, where he was brought up as clerk in a Government office, and at a later date he became Mohtesib (a sort of police officer in charge of the markets) for Cairo and northern Egypt, and afterwards inspector of the Kalânesi foundation at Damascus. He declined the post of cadi in the latter town. He was, however, mainly engrossed in scholarly pursuits as a traditionist and a jurisconsult, but especially as an indefatigable student of history. He is reproached by his contemporaries for a somewhat inordinate zeal in theological controversy, but otherwise passed a quiet and uneventful life. Makrizi’s literary activity was very great; he was not a man of original power, and his books are largely compilations, in which he is not always scrupulous in naming the sources to which he is indebted, but his learning was vast, his observation accurate, and his [9:15:312] judgment sagacious. His most important work is the historical and topographical description of Egypt (El- Mawà t iz wa'l-Γtibdr fi dhikr el-Hitat wa'1-Athàr), of which an edition in 2 vols, folio has appeared at BuL4k (1270 A.H., 1854 A.D.). This is in many respects a monumental work; the elaborate description of mediaeval Cairo is of unique interest.^[2. Various extracts have been published in Europe, e.g., the History of the Copts, in Arabic and German, by Wuestenfeld (Gott., 1845). For other extracts, list of MSS., &c., see Pertsch, Arab. Handschriften zu Gotha, No. 1675; and Cat. Codd. MSS. Or. Mus. Brit., p. 156. ] It has enjoyed a great reputation, having even been translated into Turkish.

Besides this Work Makrizi wrote a variety of other books bearing on Egypt. The unfinished Mukaffd is a vast alphabetical cyclopaedia of Egyptian biography; three volumes of the author’s autograph are at Leyden (dcccxx of the printed catalogue), and one is at Paris. He also wrote three works on the history of Egypt under the Moslems. An imperfect copy of the second in the author’s autograph, containing the history of the Fatimites, is at Gotha (Pertsch, No. 1652; Kosegarten, Chrest., p. xvii.), while the third (history of the Ayyιibite and Mameluke sovereigns) has been in great part translated by Quatremère {Histoire des Sultans Mamlouks de V Egypte, 2 vols., 1837—45). Of a biographical dictionary of Makrizi’s contemporaries one autograph volume is preserved at Gotha (No. 1771). A number of minor works of our author are known in Europe in MS., and several have been published, viz., on the Moslems in Abyssinia, by Pink, 1797; on Mohammedan Coinage, by Tychsen, 1797, and French translation by De Sacy, 1797: on Arab Weights and Measures, by Tychsen, 1800; on the Arabic Tribes that Migrated to Egypt, by Wuestenfeld, 1847; History of Hadramaut, by Noskowy, 1866. Of a great work on the earliest history of the Arabs part at least is still known in Egypt.

For further details as to Makrizi and his writings see the contemporary biographies published by De Sacy {Chrest. Arabe) and Hamaker {Spec. Cat. Cod. Lugd. Bat.), and the introduction to Quatremère’s work already named.
