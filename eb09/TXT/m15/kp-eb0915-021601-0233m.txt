MAGISTRATE. The term magistrate, derived from the Latin magistratus, is one of more general and comprehensive meaning than Justice of the Peace, which has already been treated of (vol. xiii. p. 789), and is of far higher antiquity. In its full significance it indicates one side of the universal public relation by which men are connected together as governors and governed—in other words, as magistrates and people. Of magistrates some are supreme, in whom the sovereign power and executive government of the state reside, as the king or queen regnant, or the president of a republic, as of the United States; and such a functionary would formally be designated the first magistrate of the realm or state. Speaking generally, a magistrate may be described as a public civil officer invested with legal or other authority; but the term is more particularly applied to subordinate officers, as justices of the peace and the like, deriving their authority solely from the chief of the state or in virtue of legislative enactment. During the Roman republic the offices of magistrate and judge were distinct and separate. A magistrate was appointed cum jurisdictione et imperio ; to a judge belonged only nuda notio sine jurisdictione et impemo. The office of the magistrate was to inquire into matters of law; and whatever business was transacted before him was said to be done in jz<,re. The office of the judge was to inquire into matters of fact; and whatever was transacted before him was said to be done in judicio. This distinction is thus clearly defined by Cicero in his well-known oration for Cluentius :—“Legum ministri, magistratus; legum interpretes, judices.” When the magistrate took cognizance both of the law and the fact he was said to administer justice extra ordinem ; and the judgment so administered was called extraordinary. The magistrate, when he decided on matters of law, was assisted by a council of ten, called decemviri litibus judicandis. To these was added in important cases another council of one hundred and five persons, selected from each tribe, whose judgment was final; this was called judicium centumvirale. After the decline of the Roman republic the offices of magistrate and judge were united, by which means all judgments became extraordinary, and the distinction of what was done injure and in judicio was abolished. The magistrates were chosen only from the patricians in the early republic, but in the course of time the plebeians shared in these honours. The chief magistrates of Athens were designated archons. They were nine in number, and none were chosen but such as were descended from ancestors who had been free citizens of the republic for three generations. They took an oath that they would observe the laws, administer justice with impartiality, and never suffer themselves to [9:15:217] be corrupted. They all had the power of punishing malefactors with death. The chief among them was called archon, and the year took its designation from him,—the archon epoηymus, who was also constituted a sort of state protector of those who were unable to defend themselves. The Franks, Lombards, and Saxons appear to have been jealous of judicial authority, and averse to removing what concerned a man’s private right out of the hands of his neighbours and equals; every ten families are supposed to have had a magistrate of their own election, the tything man of England, the decanus of France and Lombardy. The decanus was the lowest species of judge.
