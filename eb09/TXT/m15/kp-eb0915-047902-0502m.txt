MANGALIA, a town on the coast of the Black Sea, in the south of the Dobrudja, at the head of a district in the new Roumanian province of Kustendji. In the time of Genoese supremacy in the Black Sea it was a place of 30,000 inhabitants; and its population has again risen from a few hundreds to upwards of two thousand. According to the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum, it is to be identified with the ancient Thracian city of Callatis (or Acervetis, as it was formerly called)â€”a colony of Miletus which continued to be a flourishing place to the close of the Roman period.
