MAI, Angelo (1782-1854), cardinal, well known as the discoverer and editor of numerous ancient texts, was born of humble peasant parentage at Schilpario, a mountain village in the province of Bergamo, Lombardy, on March 7, 1782. For the excellence of his early education, received at Bergamo, he was indebted to a Jesuit priest named Mozzi, whom the suppression of the order had caused to settle in the neighbourhood. He afterwards accompanied Mozzi to a college at Colorno, in the duchy of Parma, where the J esuits had been permitted to re-establish themselves; and there he entered the noviciate of the society in 1799. In 1804, after the brief which restored the Jesuits to the Two Sicilies had been granted, he was removed to Naples as teacher of classics in the college there. Next, after completing his theological studies at the Collegium Romanum, he lived for some time at Orvieto, where he was admitted to priestly orders, and was engaged partly in teaching and partly in the palaeographical studies for which he had already manifested a strong partiality. The political events of 1808 necessitated his withdrawal from Rome (to which he had meanwhile returned) to Milan, where· he assumed the functions of a secular priest, and in 1813, through the influence of Mozzi, was made custodian of the Ambrosian library. He now threw himself with characteristic energy and zeal into the business of carefully exploring the numerous and valuable MSS. committed to his charge, and in the course of the next six years was able to restore to the world a considerable number of long-lost works. With the full approval of all concerned he now withdrew from his connexion with the Society of Jesus, and in 1819 he was invited to Rome as chief keeper of the library of the Vatican. Soon after his installation there he found the palimpsest from which he edited the De Pepublica of Cicero; this, probably the most important work of his life, was followed by the publication of a vast number of fragments of Greek and Latin fathers and historians. In 1833 Mai was transferred from the office of Vatican librarian to that of secretary of the congregation of the Propaganda; on February 12, 1838, he was raised to the dignity of cardinal. In this rank he successively discharged the functions of prefect of the congregation for the supervision of the Oriental press, prefect of the congregation of the council of Trent, and cardinal librarian of the Roman Church. He died at Castelgandolfo, near Albano, on September 9, 1854, bequeathing his valuable private library at half its estimated value to the Vatican, the proceeds to be applied to the relief of the poor of his native village.

To the period of his Milanese activity belong 3f. T. Ciceronis trium orationum, pro Scauro, pro Tullio, pro Flacco, partes ineditae (1814, from a palimpsest containing the poems of Sedulius); Μ. T. Ciceronis trium orationum, in Clodium et Curionem, de aere alieno Milonis, de rege Alexandrino, fragmenta inedita (1814, from a MS. containing a Latin translation of the Acta of the council of Chalcedon); Μ. Com. Frontonis opera inedita, cum epistolis, item ineditis, Antonini Pii, Marci Aurelii, Lucii Veri et Appiani, necnon aliorum veterum fragmentis (1815); portions of eight speeches of Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, fragments of Plautus, the oration of Isaeus De hereditate Cleonymi, the last nine books of the Antiquities of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and a number of other editorial labours. Μ. Tullii Ciceronis de Republica quae supersunt appeared at Rome in 1822; Scriptorum Veterum nova collectio, e Vaticanis codicibus edita (10 vols. 4to), in 1825-38; Classicorum Auctorum Collectio e Vaticanis codicibus edita (10 vois. 8vo) in 1828-38; Spicilegium Romanum (10 vols. 8vo) in 1839-44; and Patrum nova Bibliotheca (6 vols. 4to) in 1845-53. His edition of the celebrated Codex Vaticamιs, completed in 1838, but not published (ostensibly on the ground of inaccuracies) till four years after his death (1858, 5 vols. 4to), is unsatisfactory and has been superseded [9:15:294] by the subsequent magnificent edition of Vercellone and Cozza (Rome, 1868), which in turn leaves much tobe desired. Generally speaking, it may be said that the services rendered to scholarship by Mai (great though they were) were merely those of a laborious and persevering pioneer; as a textual critic he does not rank high, either for sagacity or for accuracy.
