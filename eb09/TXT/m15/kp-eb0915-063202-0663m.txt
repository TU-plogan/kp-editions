MATHEWS, Charles James (1803—1878), comedian, son of the above, was born at Liverpool, 26th December 1803. After attending Merchant Taylors’ School he was articled as pupil to an architect, and he continued nominally to follow this business till 1835. His first appearance on the stage was made at the Adelphi, London. In 1838 he married Madame Vestris, then lessee of the Olympic, but neither his management of this theatre, nor subsequently of Covent Garden, nor of the Lyceum, resulted in pecuniary advantage. As an actor, however, he held from the first an unrivalled place in his peculiar vein of light eccentric comedy. The inimitable easy grace of his manner, and the imperturbable solemnity with which ⅜⅛e perpetrated his absurdities, never failed to charm and amuse; his humour was never broad, but always measured and restrained. His range of characters was exceptionally narrow, and he was wholly incapable of representing any form of strong passion. It was as the leading character in such plays as the Game of Speculation, My Awful Dad, Cool as a Cucumber, Patter versus Clatter, and Little Toodlekins, that he specially excelled. Mathews was one of the few English actors who have played in French successfully—his appearance at Paris in 1863 in a French version of Cool as a Cucumber, written by himself, being received with the utmost approbation. After reaching his sixty-sixth year, Mathews set out on a tour round the world, and on his return in 1872 he continued to prosecute his professional duties without interruption till within a few weeks of his death, on July 26,1878. See Life of Charles James Mathews, edited by Charles Dickens, 2 vols., 1879.
