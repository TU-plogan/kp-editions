MARTIN^[1. The older English form, Martlet (French, Martelet'), is, except in heralds’ language, almost obsolete, and when used is now applied in some places to the Swift {q.v. ). ] (French, Martinet), the Hirundo urbica of Linnaeus and Chelidon urbica of modern ornithologists, a bird very well known throughout Europe, including even Lapland, where it is abundant, retiring in winter to the south of Africa.^[2. Since the publication of the account of this species in YarrelΓs British Birds (ed. 4, ii. p. 354), Mr Gurney has informed the writer of a specimen obtained out of a migratory flock flying very high on the Qua'qua’ river, lat. 19° 10' S., by the expedition of Messrs Jameson and Ayres, 23d October 1880. ] It also inhabits the western part of Asia, and appears from time to time in large flocks in India; but the boundaries of its range and those of at least one of its Eastern congeners cannot as yet be laid down. The Martin (or House-Martin, as it is often called, to distinguish it from the Sand-Martin presently to be mentioned) commonly reaches its summer-quarters a few days later than the Swallow (q.v.), whose habits its own so much resemble that heedless persons often disregard the very perceptible differences between them, the Martin’s white rump and lower parts being conspicuous as it flies or clings to its “loved mansionry” attached to our houses, for, as Shakespeare wrote—

“No jutty, frieze, Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle.”

—Macbeth, act i. sc. 6.

This nest, made of the same material as the Swallow’s, is, however, a far more difficult structure to rear, and a week or more is often occupied in laying its foundations— the builders clinging to the wall while depositing the mud of which it is composed. But, the base once securely fixed, the superstructure is often quickly added till the whole takes the shape of the half or quarter of a hemisphere, and a lining of soft feathers, mixed with a few bents or straws, fits it for its purpose. The Martin sets about building very soon after its return, and a nest that has outlasted the winter’s storms is almost at once reoccupied; though if a new nest be needed its construction often involves great delay, for any excess of wet or drought retards the operation, and the work is generally placed in such an exposed situation that heavy driving rains will frequently wash away the half-dried walls. However, the bird mostly perseveres against these and other untowardnesses, contriving in the course of the summer to raise a second or, rarely, a third brood of offspring—though it is certain that the latest broods often die in the nest—apparently through failure of food. Yet what seem to be adults of this species are observed in England every year so late as November, and there are several instances of its appearance within a few days of the winter solstice; but it is to be remarked that these late birds are almost certainly strangers, and not natives of the locality in which they are seen.

The Sand-Martin, Hirundo riparia of Linnaeus and Cotile riparia of modern writers, differs much in appearance and habits from the former. Its smaller size, mousecoloured upper surface, and jerking flight ought to render it easily recognizable from the other British Hirundinidx; but through carelessness it is seldom discriminated, and, being the first of the Family to return to its northern home, the “early Swallow” of newspaper-writers would seem to be nearly always of this species. Instead of the clay-built nest of the House-Martin, this bird bores, with a degree of regularity and an amount of labour rarely excelled in its Class, horizontal galleries in a natural or artificial escarpment. When beginning its excavation, it clings to the face of the bank, and with its bill loosens the earth, working from the centre outwards, assuming all sorts of positions—as often as not hanging head downwards. The form of the boring and its length depend much on the nature of the soil; but the tunnel may extend to 4, G, or even 9 feet. The gallery seems intended to be straight, but inequalities of the ground, and especially the meeting with stones, often cause it to take a sinuous course. At the end is formed a convenient chamber lined with a few grass stalks and feathers, the latter always beautifully arranged, and upon them the eggs are laid. The Sand-Martin has several broods in the year, and is much more regular than other Hirundinidae in its departure for the south. The kind of soil needed for its nestinghabits makes it a somewhat local bird; but no species of the Order Passeres has a geographical range that can compare with this. In Europe it is found nearly to the North Cape, and thence to the Sea of Okhotsk. In winter it visits many parts of India, and South Africa to the Transvaal territory. In America its range is even more extraordinary, extending (due regard being of course had to the season of the year) from Melville Island to Caiçara in Brazil, and from Newfoundland to Alaska.

The Purple Martin of America,^[3. In 1840 an example is said to have been killed at Kingstown in Ireland, the skin of which is in the Dublin Museum of Science and Art. ] Hirundo or Progne purpurea, requires some remarks as being such a favourite bird in Canada and in the United States. Naturally breeding in hollow trees, it readily adapts itself to the nest-boxes which are very commonly set up for its accommodation; but its numbers are in some years and places subject to diminution in a manner which has not yet been satisfactorily explained. The limits of its range in winter are not determined, chiefly owing to the differences of opinion as to the validity of certain supposed kindred species found in South America; but according to some authorities it reaches the border of Patagonia, while in summer it is known to inhabit lands within the Arctic Circle. The male is almost wholly of a glossy steel-blue, while the female is much duller in colour above, and beneath of a brownish-grey.

Birds that may be called Martins^[4. The Martin of French colonists (in the Old World) is an Acridotheres, one of the Starlings fø.u). ] occur almost all over the world except in New Zealand, which is not regularly inhabited by any member of the Family. The ordinary Martin of Australia is the Hirundo or Hylochelidon nigricans of most ornithologists, and another and more beautiful form is the Ariel or Fairy-Martin of the same country, Hirundo or Lagenoplastes ariel. This last builds of mud a bottle-shaped nest, as does also the Bock-Martin of Europe, Hirundo or Biblis rupestris∙, but space fails wherein to tell more of these interesting birds. (a. n.)
