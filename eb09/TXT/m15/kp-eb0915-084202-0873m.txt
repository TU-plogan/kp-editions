MELTON MOWBRAY, a market-town of England, county of Leicester, is pleasantly situated in a fertile vale, at the confluence of the Wreake and Eye, 15 miles northeast of Leicester and 104 north of London by rail. The Eye is spanned by a bridge of four arches. The town consists principally of two main streets, and is substantially built of brick. The church of St Mary, a handsome cruciform structure partly in the Early English style, and adorned by a lofty and richly ornamented tower, was heightened and otherwise enlarged in the reign of Elizabeth, and has also undergone modern improvements. There are largely endowed almshouses and several other charities. Melton is the seat of a celebrated hunting district, in connexion with which there are stables in the town capable of accommodating about eight hundred horses. It is also well known for its pork pies, and has a very large trade in Stilton cheese. There are breweries and tanneries, as well as an important cattle market. Ironworks have lately been erected. The town possesses great railway facilities. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 5033, and in 1881 it was 5766.

The old name of Melton was Medeltone, and the place is of considerable antiquity. During the Civil War it was in February 1644 the'scene of the defeat, with great slaughter, of the parliamentary forces by the royalists. It is the birthplace of John Henley the orator.
