MARIANA, Juan de (1536-1624), a celebrated Spanish historian, was born of obscure parentage at Talavera de la Reina in 1536. He studied at the university of AlcalA, and was admitted at the age of seventeen into the Society of Jesus, where he soon attracted notice by his brilliant talents and extensive acquirements. Called to the Collegium Romanum in 1561, he there professed theology four years, and reckoned among his pupils Robert Bellarmine, afterwards the famous cardinal. He then passed into Sicily, where he remained for about two years, and in 1569 he was sent to Paris, where his -expositions of the writings of Aquinas attracted large audiences. In 1574 the decline of his health compelled him to give up teaching, and he obtained permission to return to Spain; the rest of his life was passed at the Jesuits’ house in Toledo, in a vigorous literary activity which was interrupted only by the molestations to which his too great independence, liberality, and candour exposed him. He died on February 17, 1624.

His great work, Historiae de Piébus Hispaniae, first appeared in twenty books at Toledo' in 1592; ten books were subsequently added (1605), bringing the work down to the accession of Charles V., and in a still later abstract of events the author completed it to the accession of Philip IV. in 1621. It was so well received that Mariana was induced to translate it into Spanish. The first part of this in some respects new work {Historia de Espana} appeared in 1601; it was completed in 1609, and much enlarged and improved in three subsequent editions which appeared during the translator’s lifetime. It has been frequently reprinted since 1624, both in Latin and in Spanish; and an English translation by J. Stevens appeared in 1699. Mariana’s History is justly esteemed for the extent of the author’s researches, for the general accuracy of his acquaintance with the materials at his command, for the sagacity of his reflexions and characterizations, and above all for the merit of his style, which, in its simplicity, vividness, and directness, has deservedly been compared to that of Livy. The modern student may regret but can hardly blame the credulity with which in too many cases he has without the least attempt at historical criticism adopted the “received traditions of his country.” Of the other works of Mariana, the most interesting is his treatise De Rege et Regis Institutione, of which the first edition, dedicated to Philip III., appeared at Toledo in 1599. In its sixth chapter the question whether it is lawful to overthrow a tyrant is freely discussed and answered in the affirmative,—a circumstance which brought much popular odium upon the Jesuits, especially after the assassination of Henry IV. of France in 1610. See Bayle’s Dictionnaire and Hallam’s Literary History, part ii. chap. iv. A volume entitled Tractatus VII. Theologici ct Historici, published by Mariana at Cologne in 1609, containing in particular a tract “On Mortality and Immortality,” and another “De Mutatione Monetae,” was put upon the Index Expurgatorius, and led to the confinement and punishment of its author by the Inquisition. During his confinement there was found among his papers a criticism upon the Jesuits (De las Enfermedades de la Compailia de Jesus y de sus Remcdios'), which was believed to have been written by him. It was not printed until after his death (1625).
