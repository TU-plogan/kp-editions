MARGARET, St, queen of Scotland, born in Hungary about 1040, was a daughter of Edward the Atheling, son of Edmund Ironside; her mother was Agatha, most probably a niece of Queen Gisela of Hungary and of the emperor Henry II. She accompanied her father to England in 1057, and after the Norman Conquest she was brought (1068) to Scotland, where she became the wife of Malcolm Canmore in the spring of 1069. She survived her husband, who died in November 1093, by only a few days (see Scotland). The chroniclers all agree in depicting Queen Margaret as a strong, pure, noble character, who had very great influence over her husband, and through him over Scottish history, especially in its ecclesiastical aspects. Her religion, which was genuine and intense, was of the newest Roman style; and to her are attributed a number of reforms by which the Church of Scotland was considerably modified from the insular and primitive type which down to her time it had exhibited. Among those expressly mentioned are a change in the manner of observing Lent, which thenceforward began as elsewhere on Ash Wednesday and not as previously on the following Monday, and the abolition of the old practice of observing Saturday (Sabbath), not Sunday, as the day of rest from labour (see Skeneâ€™s Celtic Scotland, book ii. chap. 8). Her sons Edgar, Alexander, and David successively occupied the throne of Scotland; her elder daughter, Matilda, became the wife of Henry I. of England in 1101. Margaret was canonized by Innocent IV. in 1251, and by Clement X. she was made patroness of Scotland. Her festival (semiduplex) is observed by the Roman Church on June 10.
