MAYKOP, a town of the Caucasus, Russia, in the province of Kuban, on the Byelaya, a tributary of the Kuban, 93 miles to the south-east of Yekaterinodar, the capital of the province. Formerly it was merely a fortified “stanitsa” (village of Cossacks) and the centre for military operations against western Caucasus. But, owing to its position in a very fertile country where settlers from Russia found plenty of rich soil which had been abandoned by the natives, Maykop has become a wealthy town, and its population has rapidly increased to 22,550. Most of them are still agriculturists, but others are engaged in a brisk trade in the produce obtained from the large and wealthy stanitsas of the surrounding district.
