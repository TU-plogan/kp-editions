MAURER, Georg Ludwig von (1790-1872), a distinguished German jurist and statesman, was born at Erpolsheim in the Bavarian Palatinate, November 2, 1790. He was the son of a Protestant pastor. He received his education at the university of Heidelberg, and afterwards followed for some time the profession of an advocate. In 1812 he went to reside in Paris, where, with the aid of the great libraries of that city, he entered on a systematic study of the ancient legal institutions of Germany. On his return to Bavaria he was appointed substitute for the attorney-general in the district of Spires and Landau. In 1824 he published at Heidelberg his first work, Geschickte des alt-germanischen und namentlich alt-bairischen öffentlich-mündlichen Gerichtsverfahren, which obtained the first prize of the academy of Munich. In 1826 he was made one of the professors of law in the university of Munich. In 1832, Otho, son of King Louis of Bavaria, having been chosen to fill the throne of Greece, a council of regency was nominated to conduct the government of that country during his minority. Of this council Von Maurer was appointed a member, the others being the Count von Armansperg, who was president, Major-General K. W. von Heideck, and K. von Abel. They applied themselves energetically, and at first apparently in a spirit of concord, to the task of creating for the new kingdom institutions adapted to the requirements of a modern civilized community. But grave differences soon made themselves felt, Maurer being at variance with the president on important administrative questions. These being referred to King Louis, he decided in favour of the president, and Maurer and Abel were suddenly recalled in 1834. The loss of Maurer was a serious one for Greece; he was the ablest, most energetic, and most liberal-minded member of the regency, and had already done important work in the juridical and educational organization of the kingdom. It was through his enlightened efforts that Greece had obtained a revised penal code, regular tribunals, and an improved system of civil procedure. Soon after his recall, he published his work entitled Das griechische Volk in öffentlicher, kirchlicher, und privatrechtlicher Beziehung vor und nach dem Freiheitskampfe bis zum 31 Juli 1834 (3 vols., Heidelberg, 1835-36). This book is a valuable source of information on the history of Greece during the preceding years, its condition before the call of Otho to the throne, and the labours of the council of regency down to the time of the author’s recall. Notwithstanding his removal from office, he does not appear to have forfeited the esteem or goodwill of King Louis. After the fall of the ultramontane ministry of Abel in 1847, he became minister of foreign affairs and of justice, but on attempting to carry out reforms he was overthrown; retiring then from political life, he devoted himself altogether to historical and juristic studies, the fruits of which he gave to the world in successive publications. He died at Munich, May 9,1872.

He also superintended the preparation of a part of the continuation of Jacob Grimm’s Wcisthümer, published under the auspices of the academy of Munich, 1866. His researches on the ancient village communities of Germany are of special interest and importance.
