MÉHUL, ÉtienneHenri (1763-1817), one of the most remarkable composers of France, was born at Givet, in Ardennes, on the 24th of June 1763. His father being too poor to give him a regular musical education, his first ideas of art were derived from a poor blind organist of Givet; yet such was his aptitude that, when ten years old, he was appointed organist of the convent of the Récollets. In 1775 an able German musician and organist, Wilhelm Hauser, was engaged for the monastery of Lavaldieu, a few miles from Givet, and Méhul became his occasional pupil. In his sixteenth year he was taken to Paris by a military officer, and placed himself under Edelmann, a good musician and harpsichord player. His first attempts at instrumental composition in 1781 did not succeed, and he therefore turned his attention to sacred and dramatic music. The great composer Gluck received him kindly, and gave him advice in his studies. After various delays and disappointments during his efiorts for six years to obtain, at the Grand Opera, a representation of his Cora el Alonzo, he offered to the Opéra Comique his Euphrosine et Coradin, which, being accepted and performed in 1790, at once fixed his reputation. The critics acknowledged in it great energy of dramatic expression, and much brilliant instrumentation, but objected to a general want of graceful melody,—a strange complaint, since his style is far more refined than that of either Hérold or Auber. His opera of Stratonice had great success. After several other operas which did not succeed, his Adrien appeared, and added much to his fame, which was still further increased by his three best works, Le jeune Henri, Uthal, and Joseph, the finest of the series. He had been appointed one of the four inspectors of the Paris Conservatory, but that office made him feel continually the insufficiency of his early studies, a want which he endeavoured to remedy by incessant application. Timoleon, Ariodant, and Bion followed Stratonice, with various success. Uthal can scarcely be expected to live, since, by desire of Napoleon Bonaparte, it was written for an orchestra without violins. Epicure was composed by Méhul and Cherubini jointly; but the superiority of the latter was evident. Méliul’s next opera, E Irato, failed. After writing forty-two operas, besides a number of songs for the festivals of the republic, cantatas, and orchestral pieces of various kinds, his health gave way, from an affection of the chest, which terminated his life on the 18th of October 1817.
