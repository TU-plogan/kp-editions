MAU RÁNÍPUR, a town in Jhânsi district, in the North-Western Provinces <5f India, in 25° 15' N. lat., 79° 11' E. long. The population in 1872 was 16,428. Although now a large trading centre, the town is of quite modern commercial importance, having risen from the position of a small agricultural village through the influx of merchants seeking relief from extortionate demands made by the raja of a neighbouring native state. It contains a large community of wealthy merchants andLankers. A special variety of cloth, known as kkama, is manufactured and exported to all parts of India. The principal imports are sugar, English piece-goods, silk, metals, and coffee. Trees line many of the streets, and handsome temples ornament the town.
