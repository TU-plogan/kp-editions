MAK ̣ḲARÍ. Abu’l-'Abbâs Ahmed ibn Mohammed el-Makkarf, Arabic historian, was born at Tilimsân (Tlemcen) in Algeria, towards the close of the 16th century, and studied at Fez, where he remained occupied with literary pursuits till, for some unknown cause, he was driven into exile and, after visiting Mecca, settled in Cairo. In 1628 he came to Damascus after a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Warmly received by the scholars there, he delivered lectures on the traditions of the Prophet, and in the evenings entertained his friends with stories of the glories of Moslem Spain, a subject of interest to all Arabs, and especially to those of Syria. His friends made him promise to reduce his narrative to writing, and on returning to Cairo he devoted three years to this task. He had divorced his wife and made other preparations to settle definitively in Damascus when death overtook him in 1631.

Makkary’s great work, The Breath of Perfume from the Branch of Green Anθalusia, and Memorials of its Vizier Lisdn el-Din ibn el Khatib, consists, as the name indicates, of two parts. The first is a general history and description of Mohammedan Spain, mainly in the form of analecta from a number of authors, with many verses interspersed. This part, which is of great historical value, was published in an (incomplete) English version by P. de Gayangos (London, 1840-43) and in Arabic by Wright, Krehl, Dozy, and Dugat (Analectes sur l’histoire et la littérature des Arabes d? Espagne, Leyden, 1855, 1856, 1858, 1861). An edition in four volumes, published at Cairo (1863), contains also (in vols. iii. and iv.) the life of the famous statesman and author Lisân el-Din, vizier of Granada (oδ. 1374). Further references to literature are given by Pertsch, Arab. Hdschr. zu Gotha, No. 1697. Among other works of Makkari a commentary on the prolegomena of Ibn Khaldun is mentioned (H. Kh., 8043).
