MEMEL, the most northerly town in Germany, and the principal seat of the Baltic timber trade, is situated in the district of Konigsberg, Prussia, at the mouth of the Dange, and on the bank of a sound connecting the Kurische Haff with the Baltic Sea. On the side next the sea the town is defended by a citadel and other fortifications, and the entrance to the large and fine harbour is protected by a lighthouse. Largely rebuilt since a destructive fire in 1854, Memel contains several churches, a gymnasium, a school of navigation, an exchange, and various judicial and official establishments. It also possesses large iron-foundries, shipbuilding yards, breweries, distilleries, and manufactories of chemicals, soap, and amber wares. By far the most important interest of the town, however, is its trade, the chief items in which are timber and the grain and other agricultural products of Lithuania. The timber is brought by river from the forests of Russia, and is prepared for exportation by about thirty saw-mills. The annual value of timber exported is about £600,000. In 1880 the port of Memel was entered by 898 ships with an aggregate burden of 164,374 tons, and cleared by 932 vessels with a burden of 164,441 tons. The population of Memel in 1880 was 19,660.

Memel was founded in 1252 by Poppo von Osterna, grand master of the Teutonic order, and was at first called New Dortmund and afterwards Memmelburg. It soon acquired a considerable trade, and joined the Hanseatic League. During the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries it was repeatedly burned down by its hostile neighbours, the Lithuanians and Poles, and in the 17th century it remained for some time in the possession of Sweden. In 1757, and again in 1813, it was occupied by Russian troops. After the battle of Jena, King Frederick William III. retired to Memel; and there, in 1807, a treaty was concluded between England and Prussia. The poet Simon Dach and the astronomer Argelander were natives of Memel.
