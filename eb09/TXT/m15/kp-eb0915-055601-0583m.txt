MARLOW, Great, a parliamentary borough of Buckinghamshire, England, is finely situated on the Thames, and on a branch of the Great Western Railway, 37 miles west of London and 25 south-east of Oxford. It consists principally of two streets which cross each other at right angles. The church of All Saints, in the Later English style, erected in 1835, and lately extensively restored, possesses a number of brasses. The former bluecoat school has been reorganized under the endowed schools commission as a grammar school. The town has paper-mills, a brewery, and manufactures of lace and embroidery. It is also a favourite resort for boating and fishing. Marlow, anciently Merlaw, is a very ancient manor, and for some time after William the Conqueror it was in the possession of the crown. It returned members to parliament from the 28th of Edward I. till the 2d of Edward II., and the privilege was again restored in the 21st of James I.; since 1868 it has returned but one member. The borough includes Great and Little Marlow, Medmenham, and Bisham in Berkshire, which is united with Great Marlow by a suspension bridge, erected in 1835, at a cost of Â£20,000. The population of the borough, which has an area of 14,514 acres, 2424 being in the county of Berks, was 6627 in 1871 and 6779 in 1881.
