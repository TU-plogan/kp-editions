MARBURG, the second town of the Austrian duchy of Styria, is very picturesquely situated on both banks of the river Drave, in a plain called the Pettauer-Feld, at the base of the well-wooded Bachergebirge. It is the seat of the bishop of Lavant, and of the judicial and administrative authorities of the district, and contains a gymnasium, a “realschule,” an episcopal seminary, a normal school, a pomological school, a theatre, and three hospitals. The principal buildings are the cathedral, the tower of which commands a beautiful view, and the old castle. Its situation in the midst of a fertile vine-growing district, connected by the navigable Drave with Hungary, and by railway with Vienna, Trieste, the Tyrol, and Carinthia, makes it the centre of a considerable traffic in wine and grain. Its industrial products are leather, iron and tin wares, liqueurs, and sparkling wine, and it also contains several large cooperages. The extensive workshops of the South Austrian Railway are situated in the suburb of Magdalena, on the right bank of the Drave, and give employment to nearly three thousand hands. With the exception of a successful resistance to Matthias Corvinus in 1480-81, the history of the town presents no notable event. In 1880 Marburg contained 17,628 inhabitants, including a garrison of 1600 men. The environs abound in interesting and picturesque points.
