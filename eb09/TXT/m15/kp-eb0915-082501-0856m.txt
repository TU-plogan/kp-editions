MEERANE, a rapidly increasing industrial town in south-eastern Saxony, lies in the district of Zwickau, about 37 miles to the south of Leipsic. It contains an old church, a “Realschule,” and a technical school for weavers. The leading industry is the weaving of woollen and half-woollen cloth, employing 3000 power-looms and 15,000 hand-looms, and producing goods of the annual value of upwards of £200,000. A large proportion of the cloth is exported to America and Japan. Meerane also possesses several important dye-works, besides smaller industrial establishments of various kinds. The population in 1880 was 22,293.
