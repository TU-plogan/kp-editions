MACCABEES. The name Maccabee (Mακκαβα7os) is properly and originally the distinguishing surname of Judas, son of Mattathias, the first great hero of the Jewish revolt against Antiochus Epiphanes. The source of the name is uncertain, but it is most natural to connect it with 2^0, “hammer,” and so the Syriac writes the name with p not 3. Ewald (Gesch., iv. 403) is doubtless right in arguing from 1 Mac. vi. 43, &c., that the surnames of the sons of Mattathias were simply distinguishing epithets which they bore in ordinary life, and in this light [9:15:131] “hammerman” appears as a natural surname enough, the occasion of which it would be vain to inquire into. 1 From Judas the name was in later times extended to the whole family, or to the party it represented, or even, as in the title of 3 Maccabees, to other contenders or sufferers for the faith of Israel in the Greek period. The more correct name of the family was Hasmoneans, ’ Aσ[σ]α∕Λo>vαΓoι, ΓP3 (Tgm. Jon. on 1 Sam. ii. 4). According to Josephus, Ant., xii, 6, § 1, this name is taken from Asamonaeus, the grandfather of Mattathias. Modern writers have suggested a connexion with the townHeshmon (Josh. XV. 27) or with D'30t^∏ j magnates, in Psalm lxviii. 31 [32]. The history of the Hasmoneans is given in Israel (vol. xiii. p. 421 sq.) ; in the appended genealogical tables (after Schürer) the dates are those of the death of each individual in years b.c.

The chief authorities are 1 and 2 Maccabees (see next article) and Josephus. For details as to other sources see Schiirer’s Neutestα-meηtliche Zeitgeschichte, which gives also a good summary of the history. Of other works subsequent to Ewald’s Geschichte, vol. iv., it is enough to name.Derenbourg, Histoire de la Palestine (1867), and Wellhausen’s Pharisäer and Sadducäer (1874). For the coins of the Hasmoneans see Madden, Coins of the Jews, 1881.
