MANIS. See Pangolin.

Μ ANISA, or Manissa, a town of Asia Minor or Anatolia, situated on the north side of Mount Sipylus, 28 miles northeast of Smyrna. This town was anciently called Maqnesia ad Sipylum (see Magnesia). It is situated on the banks of the Hermus, and is noted as being one of the neatest and cleanest cities in Asia Minor. It contains above twenty mosques, two of which are adorned on the exterior with double minarets, and in the inside with paintings and other articles. The Armenians, Greeks, and Jews have also their respective places of worship. There is also a fine khan, and a citadel, which stands on a lofty rock, and commands an extensive view. The surrounding country is rich and productive, especially of saffron, which is exported. The town is the seat of some considerable trade, and many of the inhabitants are employed in the manufacture of cotton and silk goods and goats’ hair shawls. Population about 40,000. The town is now connected with Smyrna by a railway, which is continued on to Ala-Shehr (Philadelphia). A few miles from Manisa is a colossal statue cut in the rock, which is generally supposed to be the figure of Niobe, alluded to by ancient authors.
