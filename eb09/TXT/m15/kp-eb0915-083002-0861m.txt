MEHADIA, a market-town in the county of Szôrény, Hungary, is situated on the Bella-Reka, or Bereka, 13⅜ miles north of Orsova, in 44° 55' N. lat., 22° 22' E. long. The town is small but thriving, and contains Greek Orthodox and Roman Catholic churches, the ruins of a castle, and some interesting Roman antiquities. Mehâdia is, however, chiefly of importance as the station for the Hercules Baths, distant about 3 miles east from the town, and situated in a narrow pass in the romantic valley of the Cserna. Of the twenty-two hot springs of Mehâdia, nine are now in use, the most powerful one being the Hercules, which yields about 5000 cubic feet of water per hour. The springs are all strongly impregnated with salts of sulphur, iodine, bromine, and chlorine, and their average temperature is 70° to 145° Fahr. They are much used for chronic rheumatism, gout, and cutaneous eruptions, and, during the season, which usually lasts from the middle of [9:15:831] May to the end of September, are resorted to by over a thousand visitors. The town of Mehâdia has about 2200 inhabitants, principally Roumanians and Germans.

Already in the times of the Bomans famous for their healing efficacy, the Thermae Herculis {Fontes Herculis, Aquae Herculis') were the resort of emperors, generals, and senators, whose sojourn there is attested by various inscriptions and relics. The town is the site of the ancient Roman colony of Ad Medium, near which the Roman road from the Danube to Dacia passed in its course through the valley of the Cserna. Subsequent to the destruction of the Roman empire the baths fell into disuse until 1735; great improvements have been effected in them during the present century, and recently a spacious kursaal has been built at the expense of the Hungarian Government. The fortress of Mehâdia was often stormed during the wars with the Turks, and notably in 1716, 1738, and 1789.
