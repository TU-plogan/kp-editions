MACEIO, or Macayo, a city of Brazil, the chief town of the province of Alagoas, and one of the ports open to foreign trade, is situated about 150 miles south of Pernambuco, in 9' 0 39' S. lat., on an eminence about a mile from the shore, in the midst of luxuriant vegetation. It possesses a fine cathedral and an elegant house of assembly, as well as a cotton inspection office and a custom-house. As its harbour at Jagudra on the coast is but slightly protected by reefs and a small peninsula, and the water deepens slowly from the sandy beach, vessels cannot approach the piers (of which there are several), and have to be discharged and loaded by lighters. Trade, however, is on the increase, and will develop largely on the completion of the railway to the interior. In 1880 44 British and 35 foreign vessels entered, with a burden respectively of 17,624 and 10,482 tons; and cotton and sugar were exported to the amount of 4181 and 27,810 tons. In 1839 the town became the provincial capital instead of Alagoas. The population is about 20,000.
