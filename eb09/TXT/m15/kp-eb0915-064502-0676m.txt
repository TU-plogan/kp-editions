MAXIMINUS, CaiusJulius Verus, Roman emperor from 235 to 238, was of barbarian parentage, his father being a Goth and his mother an Alan, and was born in a village on the confines of Thrace, where his immense stature and enormous feats of strength first drew the attention of the emperor Septimius Severus. From being a shepherd he became a soldier, and under Caracalla rose to the rank of centurion. He carefully absented himself from court during the reign of Elagabalus, but rose to the first military command under his successor Alexander Severus. On March 19, 235, the troops saluted him emperor, and shortly afterwards Alexander was put to death. The three years of his reign, which were spent wholly~in the camp, were marked by great cruelty and oppression; the widespread discontent thus produced culminated in a revolt in Africa and the assumption of the purple by Gordianus (q.v.'). Maximin, who was in Pannonia at the time, marched against Rome, and passing over the Julian Alps descended on Aquileia; while detained before that city he and his son were murdered in their tent by a body of praetorians. Their heads were cut off and despatched to Rome, where they were burnt on the Campus Martius by the exultant crowd (May 238).
