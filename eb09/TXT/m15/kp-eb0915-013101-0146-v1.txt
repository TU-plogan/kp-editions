MACCABEES, Books of. Two books of this name are included among the Apocrypha of the English Bible, as they had formerly been in the Vulgate, and were accepted as canonical by the council of Trent. A third book is usually included in editions of the Septuagint, and is found in common with books iv. and v. in the Syriac, but never took a place in Latin Bibles; a fourth is found in some MSS. of the Septuagint (including the Sinaitic and Alexandrian—the Vatican does not contain the Maccabee books) and also in MSS. of Josephus, and has been printed in both connexions.

1 Maccabees was originally written in Hebrew, as appears, not only from the testimony of Jerome {Prol. Calf, who had seen the Hebrew text, but from internal evidence. Josephus, however, already used the Greek, 2 and no trace of the Semitic original survives except the problematical title recorded by Origen {ap. Eus., H. E., vi. 25). 3

The book gives the history of the national movement in Judaea from the accession of Antiochus Epiphanes (175 B.c.) to the murder of Simon (135 b.c.), in a plain and honest style, and evidently from good information. When the book was written there already existed a history of the reign or high priesthood of John Hyrcanus, to which the author refers for the continuation of his narrative. On the other hand, the friendly tone in which he always speaks of the Romans seems to justify the inference that he wrote before 63 b.c. 4

2 Maccabees, covering the history from 176 B.c. to the victory over Nicanor (160 b.c.), is much inferior in value. It begins with two epistles which are certainly forgeries, and then proceeds to the task of summarizing in one book the five books of a certain Jason of Cyrene on the war of liberation against Antiochus Epiphanes. The narrative is a useful supplement to that in the first book, but is not nearly so trustworthy, and can never claim the preference where the two are in conflict. Geiger has shown that in 2 Maccabees the history is coloured and distorted by sympathy with the Pharisees, who became the bitter enemies of the Hasmoneans {Urschrift und Uebers., book i. § 4).

3 Maccabees records a persecution of the Alexandrian Jews by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, with the ultimate repentance of the tyrant. It is quite unliistorical, and the local feast of the Alexandrian Jews, of which it professes to explain the origin (vi. 36), is connected by Josephus {Cont. Ap., ii. 5) with an event that took place under Ptolemy Physcon. Ewald’s conjecture that the story contains a hidden reference to the emperor Caius {Gesch,, iv. 611 sq.~) has found considerable favour. It seems strange that this book should ever have found entrance in Christian circles. It had, however, considerable acceptance in the Eastern Church.

4 Maccabees, also known by the title τr∈pt αντοκράτορος λογlσμοv, “on the sovereignty of reason,” was ascribed to Josephus by Eusebius and Jerome. This opinion is now given up, and nothing certain can be said of its origin. It is a not uninteresting specimen of a Jewish philosophical theme composed under Stoic influence. The author illustrates the sovereignty of pious reason over the passions by historical examples, and is thus led to give anecdotes from the time of the Maccabees.

.Fritzsche’s edition of the Apocrypha (1871) is the best, and contains the four books of Maccabees. Grimm’s commentary on 1 Mac. appeared in 1853, on the other three books in 1857. There is also a commentary on 1 Mac. by Keil, 1875. On 4 Mac. there is an elaborate study by Freudenthal, Die Fl. Josephus beigelegte Schrift Ueber die Herrschaft der Vernunft, Breslau, 1869. For further literature see Schürer, NTliche Zeitgeschichte (1874), pp. 19, 650 sg., and his excellent article “Apokryphen” in Herzog-Plitt, BE., vol. i. An Arabic “Book of Maccabees,” giving a compend of Jewish history from the affair of Heliodorus to the last part of Herod’s reign, is printed in the Paris and London Polyglotts. A so-called “Fifth Book of Maccabees” is also contained in the great Ambrosian Peshito. It is in fact the sixth book of Josephus De Bello Judaico.
