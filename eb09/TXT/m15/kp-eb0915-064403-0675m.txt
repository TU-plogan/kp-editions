MAXIMILIAN I. (1459-1519), holy Roman emperor, the son of the emperor Frederick HI., was born on the 22d of March 1459. In 1477 he married Mary, daughter of Charles the Bold of Burgundy, thus securing for his family the possessions of the house of Burgundy; and by the marriage of his son Philip with the infanta Joanna in 1496 he prepared the wayfor the association of Spain with the empire under his grandson, Charles V. In 1486 Maximilian was chosen king of the Romans, and in 1493, after the death of his father, he succeeded to the imperial throne. During the reign of Frederick III. the system of private war created profound discontent, and there were urgent demands for the reform of imperial institutions. Maximilian was never thoroughly in sympathy with this movement, but at his first diet, in 1495, he declared a perpetual public peace; and he did something for the restoration of order by the establishment, in the same year, of the imperial chamber (Reichskammergericht), and, in 1501, of the imperial Aulic council (Reichshofrath). Another important change was the division of Germany into six, afterwards (in 1512) into ten, circles (Kreise), over each of which was placed a captain with a force for the punishment of disturbers of the peace. Standing troops, called Landsknechte, were for the first time organized by Maximilian, who also improved the artillery then in use, and issued good police regulations. He encouraged science, art, and literature, devoted much attention to the universities, especially those of Vienna and Ingolstadt, collected mediaeval poems, and caused copies to be made of ancient chronicles and other important manuscripts. Through the influence of his second wife, Blanca Sforza, daughter of Duke Galeazzo Sforza of Milan, he was induced to contend for supremacy in Milan and Naples; but his resources were inadequate for war on equal terms with the kings of France, Charles VIII. and Louis XII. In 1499 he carried on an unsuccessful war with the Swiss confederates, the result of which was that, by the peace of Basel, the confederates became practically independent of the empire. On the other hand, he was singularly fortunate in increasing the power of the house of Austria. By the death of his cousin, the archduke Sigismund, he inherited Tyrol; he also received Görz, Gradisca, the Pusterthal, and a part of Bavaria; and by the marriage of two of his grandchildren with children of the king of Hungary and Bohemia he took the first step towards the ultimate incorporation of these countries with the Austrian hereditary territories. He wrote several books, and planned the “Weiss-Kunig,” a kind of poetical autobiography, completed by his private secretary, Treizsaurwein von Erentreiz. Maximilian had some part also in the preparation of Theuerdank, an [9:15:645] allegory setting forth adventures in connexion with his marriage with Mary of Burgundy. At Weis, in Upper Austria, on the 12th of January 1519, he died.
