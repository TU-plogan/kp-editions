MEER, Jan vander (1632-1675), of Delft,—not to be confounded with the elder or younger Van der Meer of Haarlem or with Van der Meer of Utrecht,—is one of the excellent painters of Holland about whom the Dutch biographers give us little information.^[1. This undeserved, neglect seems to have fallen on him at an early-period, for Houbraken {Groote Schouburgh, 1718), writing little more than forty years after his death, does not even mention him. The only definite information we have from a contemporary is given by Bleyswijck {Beschrijving der Stad Delft. 1687), who tells us that he was born in 1632, and that he worked along with Carl Fabritius, an able disciple of Rembrandt, who lost his life by an explosion of a powder magazine in Delft in 1654. It is to the patient researches of W. Bürger (Th. Thorè), Havard, Obreeu, Soutendam, and others that we owe our knowledge of the main facts of his life, discovered in the archives of his native town. ] Van der Meer, or Vermeer, by which name he is also known, was born in Delft in 1632. There is a tradition, handed down by the Dutch writers, that he was a pupil of Caret Fabritius, but, in the strict sense of the word, this is almost impossible, for Fabritius was but eight years older than Van der Meer, and entered the guild of St Luke only one year before our painter. From his early death the works by Fabritius are few, but his contemporaries speak of him as a man of remarkable power, and the paintings now ascertained to be from his hand, and till recently ascribed to Rembrandt, prove him to have been deeply imbued with the spirit and manner of that master. Whether Van der Meer had ever any closer relation to Rembrandt than through companionship with Fabritius remains as yet uncertain. In 1653 he married Catherine Bolenes, and in the same year he entered the guild of St Luke of Delft, becoming one of the heads of the guild in 1662, and again in 1670. He died at Delft in 1675, leaving a widow and eight children. His circumstances cannot have been flourishing, for at his death he left twenty-six pictures undisposed of, and his widow had to apply to the court of insolvency to be placed under a curator, who, it is interesting to know, was Leeuwenhoek, the naturalist.

It is his works, however, that claim our attention. For more than two centuries he has been almost completely forgotten, and his pictures have been sold under the names [9:15:825] and forged signatures of the more popular De Hooch, Metzu, Terborch, and even of Rembrandt. The honour of first recalling the attention of the art-world to this most original painter belongs undoubtedly to Thoré, an exiled Frenchman, who described his then known works in his Musées de la Hollande (1858-60), published under the assumed name of W. Bürger. The result of his researches, continued in his Galerie Suermondt and Galerie d’Aren· berg, was afterwards given by him in a charming, though incomplete, monograph (Gazette des Beaux-Arts, 1866, pp. 297, 458, 542). The task has since been prosecuted with success by Havard (Les Artistes Hollandais'), and by Obreen (Hederlandsche Kunstgeschiedenis, DI. iv.), and we are now in a position to refer to Van der Meer’s works. His pictures are rarely dated, but, luckily for us, one of the most important bears the date 1656, and thus gives us a key to his styles. The picture referred to is the only one that has figures of life size. It is the Woman and Soldier, with other two figures, of the Dresden gallery, and is painted with remarkable power and boldness, great command over the resources of colour, and with wonderful expression of life. For strength and colour it more than holds its own beside the neighbouring Rembrandts. To this early period of his career belong, from internal evidence, the Reading Girl of the same gallery, the luminous and masterly view of Delft in the museum of the Hague, La Laitière and the small street view, both in the collection of Μ. Six van Hillegom at Amsterdam, Le Soldat et la Fillette qui Rit of Μ. Double, the Country House in the gallery at Berlin, and others. In all these we find the same brilliant style and vigorous work, a solid impasto and a crisp sparkling touch. His first manner seems to have been influenced by the pleiad of painters circling round Rembrandt, a school which we know lost favour in Holland in the last quarter of the century. During the last ten or twelve years of his life Van der Meer adopted a second manner. We now find his painting smooth and thin, and his colours paler and softer. Instead of masculine vigour we have refined delicacy and subtlety, but in both styles beauty of tone and perfect harmony are conspicuous. Through all his work may be traced his love of lemon-yellow and of blue of all shades. Of his second style typical examples are to be seen in La Coquette of the Brunswick gallery, in the Woman Reading in the Van der Hoop collection at the Hague, in the Lady at a Casement belonging to Lord Powerscourt (exhibited at Burlington House, 1878), and in the Music Master and Pupil belonging to the Queen (exhibited at Burlington House, 1876).

Van der Meer’s works are extremely rare. There is but one in the Louvre, the Lace Maker; Dresden has the two above-mentioned, while Berlin has three, all acquired in the Suermondt collection, and the Czernin gallery of Vienna is fortunate in possessing a fine picture, believed to represent the artist in his studio. In the Arenberg gallery at Brussels there is a remarkable head of a girl, half the size of life, which seems to be intermediate between his two styles. Several of his paintings are to be found in private foreign collections. In all his work there is a singular completeness and charm. In rendering momentary expression he is a master, and his pictures attract by the perfect delineation of character as well as by the technical skill of the painter. His tone is usually silvery with pearly shadows, and the lighting of his interiors is equal and natural. In all cases his figures seem to move in light and air, and in this respect he resembles greatly his fellow-worker De Hooch, who entered the guild of St Luke only two years later than Van der Meer. It is curious to read that, at one of the auctions in Amsterdam about the middle of last century, a De Hooch is praised as being “nearly equal to the famous Van der Meer of Delft.” So nearly are they allied that the best judges are divided in opinion whether the Dutch Family (“La Promenade”) of the academy of Vienna should be attributed to our painter or to De Hooch. Doubtless many of Van der Meer’s works have yet to be restored to their proper author; but, as he is now in vogue, much care will have to be used iu judging. This is specially true in regard to the landscapes and “still life ' subjects which are attributed to him. The task is made more difficult by the diversity of style of this “Protean painter,” as he is called by Dr Waagen, or, as Bürger names him, “the Sphinx of Delft.” (J. F. W.)
