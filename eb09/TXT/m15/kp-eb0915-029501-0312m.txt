MAIMBOURG, Louis (1610-1686), a French historical writer, was born at Nancy in 1610. At the age of sixteen he entered the Society of Jesus, and after completing his theological studies at Rome he became a classical master in the Jesuit college at Rouen. He afterwards devoted himself to preaching, but with only moderate success. After having taken some part in minor controversies he threw himself with energy into the dispute which had arisen as to the Gallican liberties; for his Traité historique sur les prérogatives de VÉglise de Rome (1682) he was by command of Innocent XI. expelled from his order, but rewarded by Louis XIV. with a residence at the abbey of St Victor, Paris, and a pension. He died on August 13, 1686. His numerous works (exhaustively enumerated in the Biographie Générale) include histories of Arianism, the iconoclastic controversy, the Greek schism, Lutheranism, Calvinism, and of the pontificates of Leo I. and Gregory I.; they are mere compilations, written indeed in a very lively and attractive style, but inaccurate throughout, and wherever matters of controversy are touched on, specially untrustworthy.
