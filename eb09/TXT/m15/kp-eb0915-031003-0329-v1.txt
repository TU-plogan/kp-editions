MAJOR, or Mair, John (c. 1470-1550), a theological and historical writer, was born at the village of Cleghorn, near North Berwick, Scotland, about the year 1470. After a short period spent at Cambridge, he entered the university of Paris in 1493, studying successively at the colleges of St Barbe and Montaigu, and graduating as master of arts, in 1496. Promoted to the doctorate in 1505, he lectured in philosophy at Montaigu College for some time, and had several distinguished auditors. From 1518 to 1522 he held the office of principal in the university of Glasgow, John Knox being among the number of those who attended his lectures there; he was afterwards removed to St Andrews, where George Buchanan was one of his pupils in 1525. He appears again to have returned to France for some time, but we find him once more at St Andrews in 1530, where he was head of St Salvator’s College from 1533 until his death, which took place about 1550.

He wrote In Libros Sententiarum commentarius, Paris, 1509- 19; De Historia Gentis Scotorum libri sex, Paris, 1521; Commentarius in Physica Aristotelis, Paris, 1526; and In Quatuor Euangelia Expositiones Luculentae, Paris, 1529. By Knox he is spoken of as having been in his day an oracle in religious matters; and it has been conjectured that both the great Reformer and Buchanan were largely indebted to him for their advanced opinions on political and ecclesiastical questions. His writings do not now, however, possess any interest or importance apart from this circumstance;, and even Buchanan has allowed himself to speak of his old preceptor as “Joannes solo cognomine major.”
