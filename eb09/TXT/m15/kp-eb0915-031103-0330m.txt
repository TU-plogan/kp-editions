MAKÓ, a corporate town of Hungary, and capital of the trans-Tisian county of Csanâd, is situated near the right bank of the Maros, about 15 miles east-south-east of Szeged, in 46° 13' N. lat., 20° 28' E. long. The town consists of the three wards of Bujâk, Szent-Lörincz .(Saint-Lawrence), and Ujvâros (New Town), and has, besides the usual official buildings connected with the administration of a county, Roman*and Greek Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, and a synagogue; also an elegant (Calvinist) gymnasium, the bishop of Csanâd’s palace and gardens, royal and circuit courts of law, barracks, tax and salt offices, a timber trading agency, a manufactory of agricultural implements, and numerous mills. The surrounding country is fertile. The communal lands are extensive, and afford excellent pasturage for horses and sheep, as also for large herds of horned cattle, for the size and quality of which Makô has obtained a high repute. An abundance of fish and aquatic fowl is supplied by the Maros, the water of which river is used also for drinking purposes, that from the wells being unpalatable. The town is protected from inundations of the Maros by a powerful dike, but the commune nevertheless sometimes suffers during the spring floods (see Hungary, vol. xii. p. 363).
