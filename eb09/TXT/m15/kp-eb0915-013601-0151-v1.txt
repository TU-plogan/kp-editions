MACDONALD, Lawrence (1798-1878), sculptor, was born at Gask, Perthshire, Scotland, in 1798, and in early life served as a mason’s apprentice. Having shown an aptitude for stone carving, he went while still a youth to Edinburgh as an art student at the Trustees’ Academy, finding at the same time a good deal of occasional employment in carving coats of arms and other ornamental figures on the gateways or walls of country houses. By the help of friends he was enabled to visit Rome, whence, after a stay of two or three years, he returned to Edinburgh in 1826. During the next few years he executed a considerable number of commissions for busts, and also devoted a good deal of time to the designing of ideal subjects, in which branch of his art, however, the public interest was comparatively slight. From 1832 until his death on March 4, 1878, his home was in Rome; during the long period of forty-six years his chisel never rested, and the number of works that issued from his studio, chiefly in the department of portrait sculpture, was very great. Among his ideal works may be mentioned Ulysses and his Dog Argos, Andromeda chained to the Rock, Eurydice, Hyacinth, a Siren, and a Bacchante. His busts, while excellent as likenesses, are remarkable for purity and dignity of style: and the ideal works are at once full of grace and carefully correct in form, design, and treatment.
