MAURICE (Mauricius), St, aud his companions are commemorated as martyrs by the Roman Church on September 22. The earliest extant form of the legend relating to them is that of Eucherius, bishop of Lyons about the middle of the 5th century, who tells us that Maurice was in command of the Theban legion (so called because raised in the Thebais) when it was sent into the West and attached to the army of Maximian. Themselves Christians to a man, its members refused to persecute their coreligionists, and for this, after having twice been decimated, the legion was utterly destroyed by command of the emperor at Octodurum (Martigny) near Geneva. A later form of the k legend connects it with the expedition of Maximian against the Bagaudae, who are taken to have been Christians; the martyrdom of the legion arises out of its refusal to take part in a great sacrifice which had been ordered at Octodurum; and another name—that of Exsuperius—ds associated with Maurice’s. Later still, Gregory of Tours knows of a company of the same legion which suffered at Cologne (their leader subsequently became known as Gereon). The date usually assigned to the martyrdom of the Theban legion is 286 a.d. ; but it is matter of history that at that period the Christians were everywhere unmolested in the exercise of their religion throughout the Roman empire. On the other hand, at no later date have we any evidence of the presence of Maximian in the Valais; and, apart from the great a priori improbability of the extirpation of a whole legion under any circumstances on account of its Christian profession, it is practically impossible to get over the fact that such writers as Eusebius, Lactantius, Orosius, and Sulpicius Severus know nothing of such a noteworthy and startling event having taken place. But in the long and voluminous controversy as to the historical character of this legend it has of course never been attempted to deny that isolated cases of officers being put to death on account of their religion occurred during the reign of Maximian. The cultus of St Maurice and other members of the Theban legion occurs chiefly in Switzerland, the region of the Rhine, and northern Italy; the foundation of the abbey of St Maurice (Agaunum) in the Valais is usually ascribed to Sigismund of Burgundy (515).
