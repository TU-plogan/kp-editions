MARNE, a department of the north-east of France, made up from Champagne-Pouilleuse, Rémois, Perthois, Vallage, and La Brie-Charnpenoise, districts formerly belonging to Champagne. Its chief town, Châlons-sur-Marne, is 92 miles in a direct line east of Paris. Bounded on the W. by Seine-et-Marne and Aisne, on the N. by Ardennes, on the E. by Meuse, on the S. by Haute-Marne and Aube, it is situated between 48° 3Γ and 49° 26' N. lat., and 3° 25' and 5° E. long. Its greatest length front north-east to south-west is 73 miles, and the area 3159 square miles. About one half of this consists of Champagne-Pouilleuse, a monotonous and barren plain covering a bed of chalk 1300 feet in thickness. On the west and on the east it is commanded by two ranges of hills. The highest point in the department (920 feet) is in the hill district of Rheims, which rises to the south-west of the town of the same name, between the Vesle and the Marne. The lowest level (164 feet), where the Aisne leaves the department, is not far distant. To the south of the Marne the hills of Rheims are continued by the heights of La Brie (700 to 800 feet). All these belong geologically to the basin of Paris. They slope gently towards the west, but command the plain of Champagne-Pouilleuse by a steep descent on the east. On the further side of the plain are the heights of Argonne (860 feet), formed of beds of the Lower Chalk, and covered by forests; they unite the calcareous formations of Langres to the schists of Ardennes, and a continuation of them stretches southward into Perthois and the marshy Bocage. The department belongs entirely to the Seine basin, but of that river there are only 13 miles, in the south-west; it there receives the Aube, which has 10 miles within the department. The principal river is the Marne, which runs through the department for 105 miles in a great sweep concave to the south-west, passing Vitry-le-François, Châlons, Épernay, and Dormans. In its course through the department it falls from 410 to 213 feet. The principal tributaries are the Saulx (which receives the Ornain) on the right, and on the left the Blaise, which waters Vassy, the Somme Soude, and the Surmeliu (with its tributary the Dhuis), whence Paris is supplied; besides the Petit Morin and the Grand Morin. Of the last three only the upper courses lie within the department. The Aisne enters the department at a point 12 miles from its source, and traverses it for 35 miles, watering Ste Menehould. Two of its affluents on the left, the Suippe and the Vesle, on which stands Rheims, have a longer course from south-east to north-west across the department.

Marne lias the climate of the region of the Seine; the annual mean temperature is 50° Fahr., the rainfall about 24 inches. Of the total area about three-fourths consists of arable land, and a sixth is under forest, whilst a twenty-fifth is meadow land. Vineyards cover 63’7 square miles. The department is largely stocked with sheep (536,000, of which 133,000 are a mixed merino breed, whose wool is used in the manufacture of merinoes, flannels, and cashmeres). Cattle are estimated to number 95,260; horses, 53,000; pigs, 62,000; goats, 6000; and asses, 6000; these last are used in the narrow pathways which intersect the vineyards. About 600,000 ft> of honey and 240,000 lb of wax are produced. The vineyards, though not of great extent, are of high value from the quality of their products. The manufacture of the sparkling wines of Champagne is an important industry, of which Épernay, Rheims, and Chalons are the chief centres. The yearly exportation is about 20,000,000 bottles, at the average value of half a crown a bottle. Cereals are grown in excess of the local consumption. Corn, hay, rye, barley, potatoes, and beetroot are the chief crops. Several communes supply the more valuable vegetables. In 1881 the produce of wine was more than 14⅜ million .gallons. The principal orchard fruits are the apple, plum, and cherry. Pine woods are largely planted in Champagne-Pouilleuse. The department produces iron ore, phosphate of lime, quantities of turf, and excellent millstones and stone for building.

The chief industry is that in wool, which has brought together, in the neighbourhood of Rheims, establishments for spinning, carding, dyeing, and weaving. The materials wrought are flannels, merinoes, tartans, shawls, rugs, and fancy articles. In 1879 the aggregate length of the various stuffs measured at Rheims was 12,198 miles. This business alone occupies 30,000 operatives in the department, and produces annually nearly 800,000 pieces, valued at £18,000,000. Hosiery in woollen employs 420 looms, and in cotton 1800. Marne contains blast-furnaces, iron, copper, and bell foundries, and manufactories of agricultural implements. Besides these there are tanyards, currying and leather-dressing establishments, and glassworks, which, with sugar-works and breweries, complete the list of the most important industries. Biscuits and gingerbread are a specialty of Rheims. The chief imports are wool, coal, and colonial wares; the exports are wine, grain, live stock, stone, whiting, pit-props, and woollen stuffs. Transport is supplied by the river Marne and the canal connecting it with the Rhine and with the Aisne, and by 300 miles of railway. The population in 1881 was 421,027, an increase of 116,371 since 1801. There are five arrondissements—those of Chalons (the chef-lieu), Épernay, Rheims, Ste Menehould, and Vitry-le-François. The department belongs partly to the archbishopric of Rheims and partly to the see of Chalons. Chalons is the headquarters of the 6th army corps; to the north of the town is the great camp devoted to military exercises.
