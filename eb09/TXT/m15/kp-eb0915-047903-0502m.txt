MANGALORE, the administrative headquarters of south Kânara district,· Madras, is situated on the Malabar coast, in 12° 5Γ 40" N. lat., 74° 52' 36" E. long., with a population in 1871 of 29,667. The town is picturesque, clean, and prosperous. The native houses are laid out in good streets, and the European quarter is particularly pleasant. Mangalore clears and exports all the coffee of Coorg, and trades directly with Arabia and the Persian Gulf. In 1875 3600 ships of 264,000 tons entered. The exports in that year were valued at £505,800, and the imports at £272,704. There is a large native Roman Catholic population, with two European bishops, several churches, and a convent. The Basel Lutheran mission has its headquarters here, and has done much good in teaching trades, &c. Good cloth is woven at their establishment; the making of roof tiles, printing, and bookbinding are also taught.
