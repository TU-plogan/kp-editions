MARUM (in Dutch Marwm), Martin Van (1750— 1837), a distinguished Dutch man of science, born at Delft. Though his fame rests chiefly on his electrical •researches, he took a prominent position in many departments of natural science. He graduated at Groningen in medicine and philosophy, and his numerous papers >take up subjects connected with botany, chemistry, hygiene, natural history, and technology, as well as with his more special department, natural philosophy. In early life his father, who was a skilled mathematician, gave him a thorough training in the one really indispensable science. After his doctorate he for some time attached himself to the celebrated botanist Camper. He then commenced medical practice in Haarlem, but seems to have been too busy with original work to pay proper attention to his numerous patients. He devoted himself mainly to lecturing on physical subjects; and, after a brief interval, his extensive knowledge and methodical habits led to his being made secretary of the scientific society of his adopted «city. For this post he was specially fitted; and, under his active guidance, the society was advanced to the «position of one of the most noted in Europe. He soon became professor of physics, and was entrusted with the care of the celebrated Teyler collection (now the Musée Teyler). He caused to be constructed for this, by •Cuthbertson, the gigantic electrical machine which, for a long period, was the most powerful in the world. He also effected great improvements in air-pumps and other pneumatic machines. Though his name is not associated with any discovery of the very first order, the number and variety of his researches (especially in connection with electricity) are remarkable. So also is the practical mode in which he regarded his results, always •when at all possible from the technological point of view. The work by which he is best known is his Treatise on Electricity (Groningen, 1776), in which all that had then been discovered in that science was carefully methodized, λ an Marum was a man of quiet but active disposition, and of simple habits and tastes, which probably conduced in no small measure to the extreme length and usefulness of his life.
