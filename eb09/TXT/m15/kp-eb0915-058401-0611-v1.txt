+=====================================================================+


MARTINI, Giovanni Battista (1706-1784), the most learned musician of the 18th century, was bornât Bologna on April 25, 1706. His father, Antonio Maria Martini, a violinist, taught him very early the elements of music, and to play the violin: at a later period he learned singing and harpsichord playing from Padre Pradieri, and counterpoint from Antonio Riccieri. Having received his education in classics from the fathers of the oratory of San Filippo Neri, he afterwards entered upon a noviciate at the Franciscan monastery at Lago, at the close of which he was received into that order on September [9:15:585] 11, 1722. Continuing his studies in the theory and practice of music with great zeal, he in 1725, though only nineteen years of age, received the appointment of chapelmaster in the Franciscan church at Bologna, where his compositions soon attracted much attention. At the invitation of amateurs and professional friends he now opened a school of musical composition at which in the course of his long life several celebrated musicians were trained, including Paolucci, Sabbatini, Ruttini, Zanotti, Sarti, Ottani, and Stanislas Mattei; as a teacher he consistently declared his preference for the traditions of the old Roman school of musical composition (see Music). Padre Martini was a zealous and indefatigable collector of musical literature, and is alleged to have been the possessor of the most extensive musical library ever formed. After a lingering illness he died at Bologna on August 4, 1784. His Elogio was published by Pietro della Valle at Bologna in the same year.

The greater number of Martini’s sacred compositions remain unprinted. The Liceo of Bologna possesses the MSS. of two oratorios; and a requiem, with some other pieces of church music, are now in Vienna. Litaniae atque antiphonae Jinales B. V. Mariae were published at Bologna in 1734, as also twelve Sonate d'intavolatura ; six Sonate per V organo cd il cembalo in 1747; and Duetti da Camera in 1763. Martini’s most important works are his Storia della Musica (Bologna, 1757-81) and his Saggio di Contrapunto (Bologna, 1774-75). The former, of which the three published volumes relate wholly to ancient music, and thus represent a mere fragment of the author’s vast plan, exhibits immense reading and industry, but it is written in a dry and unattractive style, and is overloaded with matter which cannot be regarded as historical. At the beginning and end of each chapter occur puzzle-canons, some of which are exceedingly difficult; Cherubini solved the whole of them. The Saggio is a very learned and valuable work, containing an important collection of examples from the best masters of the old Italian and Spanish schools, with excellent explanatory notes. It treats chiefly of the tonalities of the plain chant, and of counterpoints constructed upon them. Besides being the author of several controversial works, Martini drew up a Dictionary of Ancient Musical Terms, which appeared in the second volume of G. B. Doni’s Works ; he also published a treatise on The Theory of Numbers as applied to Music.
