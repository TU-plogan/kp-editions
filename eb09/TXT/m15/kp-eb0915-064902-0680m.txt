MAYER, Julius Robert (1814-1878), was born at Heilbronn, Nov. 25, 1814, studied medicine at Tübingen, Munich, and Paris, and, after a journey to Java in 1840 as surgeon of a Dutch vessel, obtained a medical post in his native town. He claims recognition as an independent a priori propounder of the “First Law of Thermodynamics,” but more especially as having early and ably applied that law to the explanation of many remarkable phenomena, both cosmical and terrestrial. His first little paper on the subject, “Bemerkungen über die Kräfte der unbelebten Natur,” appeared in 1842 in Liebig’s Annalen, five years subsequent to the republication, in the same journal, of an extract from the great memoir of Mohr (q.v.). Mayer’s statements as to the “indestructibility of force” (as he calls it) were based almost entirely upon scholastic dicta, such as causa sequat effectum, &c. The main experimental fact which he adduces in support of his reasoning as to the convertibility of work and heat is a mere repetition, in a very inadequate form, of a curious experiment made by Dr Reade of Cork, who found (Nicholson's Journal, xx., 1808, p. 113) that water was sensibly heated after being violently shaken in a phial. But Dr Reade states explicitly the precautions he had taken to protect the phial and its contents from heating by the hand of the operator,— an important detail which is unnoticed by Mayer.

It has been repeatedly claimed for Mayer that he calculated the value of the dynamical equivalent of heat, indirectly no doubt, but in a manner altogether free from error, and with a result according almost exactly with that obtained by Joule after years of patient labour in direct experimenting. Mayer assumed that the heat developed by compression of air is the equivalent of the work spent in the compression. If we had independent proof of this the result would undoubtedly follow.^[1. Séguin, three years before, had assumed that the work done by steam or any other expanding substance is the equivalent of the heat which disappears during the expansion. A similar idea, but more accurately expressed, is to be found in Mohr s paper, above referred to. ] And it has been urged that the man who, by a single burst of genius, reached at once the goal which others had been painfully seeking, merits an amount of fame commensurate with that due to discoverers like Newton or Galileo. This claim on Mayer’s behalf was first shown to be baseless by Thomson and Tait (“Energy,” Good Wards, 1862). This article gave rise to a long but lively discussion. A calm and judicial annihilation of the claim is to be found in a brief article by Stokes, Proc. Hoy. Soc., 1871, p. 54. See also Maxwell’s Theory of Heat, chap, xiii. Mayer entirely ignored the grand fundamental principle laid down by Sadi Carnot, a principle which has done even more for physics than has the conservation of energy itself, viz., that nothing can be concluded as to the relation between heat and work from an experiment in which the working substance is left at the end of an operation in a different physical state from that in which it was at the commencement. Mayer has also becu styled the discoverer of the fact that heat consists in (the energy of) motion, a matter settled at the very end of the 18th century by Rumford and Davy. In the teeth of this statement we have Mayer’s own words, “We might much rather assume the contrary, —that in order to become heat, motion must cease to be motion.”

Mayer’s real merit consists in the fact that, having for himself made out, on inadequate and even questionable grounds, the conservation of energy, and having obtained (though by inaccurate reasoning) a numerical result correct so far as his data permitted, he applied the principle with great power and insight to the explanation of numerous physical phenomena. His papers, which have been republished in a single volume with the title Die Mechanik der Wärme (2d ed., Stuttgart, 1874), are of extremely unequal mtrit. But some, especially those on Celestial Dynamics and Organic Motion, are admirable examples of what really valuable work may be effected by a man of high intellectual powers, in spite of imperfect information and defective logic.

Different, and, it would appear, exaggerated, estimates of Mayer are given in Dr Tyndall’s papers in the Phil. Mag., 1863-64 (whose avowed object was “to raise a noble and a suffering man to the position which his labours entitled him to occupy”), and in the extraordinary treatise by Dühring, Robert Mayer, der Galilei des neunzehnten' Jahrhunderts, Chemnitz, 1880. Some of the simpler facts of the case are summarized by Tait in the Phil. Mag., 1864, ii. p. 289.
