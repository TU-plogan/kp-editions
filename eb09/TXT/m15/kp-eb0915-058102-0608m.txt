MARTIN, St, bishop of Tours, was born of heathen parents at Sabaria (Stein am Anger) in Pannonia, about the year 316. When ten years of age he became a catechumen, and at fifteen, contrary to his own inclination, he entered the army. It was while he was stationed at Amiens that he divided his cloak with the beggar, and on the following night had the vision of Christ making known to his angels this act of charity to Himself on the part of “Martinus, still a catechumen.” Soon afterwards he received baptism, and, two years later, having been permitted to leave the army, he joined Hilary of Poitiers, who wished to make him a deacon, but at his own request ordained him to the humbler office of an exorcist. In the course of the years that followed he undertook a journey to Pannonia for the purpose of converting his parents, and was successful in bringing his mother within the pale of [9:15:582] the church. For some time, doubtless during the Arian troubles, he lived, along with a presbyter friend, an ascetic life on the desert island of Gallinaria near Genoa; in 360 he was again with Hilary at Poitiers, and founded in the neighbourhood the monasterium Locociagense (Licugé). Here his miracles, which included more than one case of restoring the dead to life, were very numerous, and made him so famous that in 371 the people of Tours insisted on having him for their bishop. In this capacity he was extremely zealous and enérgetic in seeking to extirpate idolatry from his diocese and from France, and by example as well as by precept he did much for the spread of the monastic system. To obtain the privacy that he required for the maintenance of his personal religion, he established the monastery of Marmoutier-les-Tours (Martini monasterium) on the banks of the Loire. At Treves, in 385, he was importunate in his entreaties that the lives of the Priscillianist heretics should be given them, and he ever afterwards refused to hold ecclesiastical fellowship with those bishops who had sanctioned their execution. He died at Candes about the year 400, and is commemorated by the Roman Church on November 11 (duplex). He is the patron saint of France, and of the cities of Mainz and Würzburg. The Life by his disciple Sulpicius Severus is practically the only source we have for his biography, but it is full of legendary matter and chronological inaccuracies. The feast of St Martin (Martinmas) took the place of an old pagan festival, and inherited some of its usages (such as the Martinsmännchen, Martinsfeuer, Martinshorn, and the like, in various parts of Germany); by this circumstance is most probably to be explained the fact that he is regarded as the patron of drinking and jovial meetings, as well as of reformed drunkards.
