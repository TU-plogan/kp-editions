MAZATLAN ^, a city and seaport of Mexico, in the state of Cinaloa, on the coast of the Pacific, near the mouth of the Gulf of California, in 23° 18’ N. lat. and 106° 56' W. long. It occupies anVattractive situation, but, as the houses are for the most part low, has not an imposing appearance. The port is often visited by English and American vessels, and is consequently the seat of several consular agents. A large smuggling trade was formerly carried on in much the same lines as the present legitimate traffic—export of bullion, dye-stuffs, and pearls, and import of manufactured goods from Europe and fruits and vegetables from San Francisco. In 1878 the value of the imports was about £600,000, that of the exports about £500,000. The population, which contains a large floating element, was stated at 12,706 in 1871.
