MATTEUCCI, Carlo (1811-1868), an Italian physicist, was born at F0rΓ1, June 20, 1811. In 1832, after completing his studies at I.’École Polytechnique, Paris, he became professor of physics at Bologna, where he had passed his earlier student days. In 1837 he removed to Ravenna, and in 1840 settled as professor of physics at Pisa. From 1847 he took an active part in politics, and in 1860 was chosen an Italian senator. At the same time he became general telegraph director, and later the superintendent of the meteorological bureaus. He died at Leghorn, June 25, 1868.

He is the author of four scientific treatises :— Lezioni di fisica (2 vols., Pisa, 1841; second edition 1851), Lezioni sui fenomeni fisico-chimici dcicorpi viventi (Pisa, 1844; second edition 1846), Manuale di tclcgτafia elcttrica (Pisa, 1850; and several later editions), and Cours special sur l'induction, le magnétisme de rotation, &c. (Paris, 1854). His numerous papers were published in the Annales de Chimie ct de Physique (1829-58); and most of them also appeared at the time in the Italian scientific journals. They relate almost entirely to electrical phenomena, such as the magnetic rotation of light, the action of gas batteries, the effects of torsion on magnetism, the polarization of electrodes, &c., sufficiently complete accounts of which are given in Wiedemann’s Galvanismus. Nine memoirs, entitled “Electro-Physiological Researches,” were published in the Philosophical Transactions, 1845-60. See Bianchi’s Carlo Mat-tcucci e ΓItalia del suo tempo (Rome, 1874).
