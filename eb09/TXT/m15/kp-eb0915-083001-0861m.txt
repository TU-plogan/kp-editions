MEGHNÁ, a river of India, forming, in the lower part of its course, the great estuary of the Bengal delta, which conveys to the sea the main body of the waters of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which unite at Goalânda in Faridpur district. The united waters thence roll south— a mighty river of great depth and turbidness, sometimes split up into half a dozen channels by sand-banks of its own formation, sometimes spreading out into a widespread sheet of water which the eye cannot see across. The river enters the sea by four principal mouths, enclosing the three large islands of Dakshin Shâhbazpur, Hatia, and Sandwip. It is navigable by native boats of the largest burden, and also by river steamers, all the year through; but the navigation is difficult, and sometimes dangerous, on account of shifting sand-banks and “snags,” and boisterous weather when the monsoon is blowing. The most favourable season for navigation is between November and February. Alluvion and diluvion are constantly taking place, especially along the seaboard, and in Noâkhâli district the land is said to have advanced seawards 4- miles in twenty-three years; while the islands fringing the mouth are annually being cut away and redeposited in fresh shapes.

The tidal phenomena of the Meghnâ surpass those of any other Indian river. The regular rise of the tide is from 10 to 18 feet, and at springs the sea rushes up in a single wave, known as the “bore,”—on the Meghnâ a justly dreaded danger to boatmen. It is greatest at the time of the biennial equinoxes, when navigation is sometimes impeded for days together. The tidal wave'is suddenly beheld advancing like a wall topped with foam of the height of nearly 20 feet, and at the rate of 15 miles an hour; in a few minutes all is over, and the river has changed from ebb to flood tide. A still greater danger is the “storm wave,” which occasionally sweeps up the Meghnâ in the shape of cyclones. The latest and most destructive of these disasters were those of May 1867 and October 1876, when the whole islands and sea-face of the mainland were entirely submerged. In the latter calamity it has been officially estimated that about 19 per cent, of the population in the mainland portion of Noâkhâli, and in the islands of Sandwip and Hatia, were drowned, and that a like proportion subsequently died of cholera and other diseases caused by the results of the storm.
