MANDRAKE, Mandragora officinarum, I.., of the potato family, order Solanaceae, is a native of Spain, Sicily, Crete, Cilicia, Syria, &c., and North Africa (Benth, et Hook., Gen. Pl., ii. p. 900; and DC., Prod., xiii. p. 466). It has a short stem bearing a tuft of ovate leaves, with a thick fleshy and often forked root. The flowers are solitary, with a purple bell-shaped corolla. The fruit is a fleshy orange-coloured berry. The mandrake has b⅛en long known for its poisonous properties and supposed virtues. It acts as an emetic, purgative, and narcotic, and was much esteemed in old times; but, except in Africa and the East, where it is used as a narcotic and antispasmodic, it has fallen into disrepute (Pickering’s Chron. Hist, of Plants, p. 247). In ancient times, according to Isidorus and Serapion, it was used as a narcotic to diminish sensibility under surgical operations, and the same use is mentioned by Kazwini, i. 297, s.v. “Luffâh.” Shakespeare more than once alludes to this plant, as when Banquo in Macbeth says—“Or have we eaten of the iïlsane root that takes the reason prisoner 1” and again in Antony and Cleopatra— “Give me to drink mandragora.” The notion that the plant shrieked when touched, so that those who desired to pluck it up had to stop their ears with pitch, is alluded to in Romeo and Juliet— “And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth, that living mortals, hearing them, run mad.” The mandrake, often growing like the lower limbs of a man, was supposed to have other virtues, and was much used for love philtres (Diosc., iv. 76), while the fruit was supposed, and in the East is still supposed, to facilitate pregnancy (Aug., C. Faust., xxii. 56; compare Gen. xxx. 14, where the Hebrew 0 ’ K ’ T∏ is undoubtedly the mandrake). Like the mallow, the mandrake was potent in all kinds of enchantment (see Maimonides in Chwolson, Ssabier, ii. 459, and the notes). Dioscorides identifies it with the κιpκaia, the root named after the enchantress Circe. To it appears to apply the fable of the magical herb Baaras, which cured demoniacs, and was procured at great risk or by the death of a dog employed to drag it up, in Josephus (B. J., vii. 6, § 3). The German name of the plant (Alraune; O. H. G. Alrûna) indicates the prophetic power supposed to be in little images (homunculi, Goldmännchen, Galgenmännchen) made of this root which were cherished as oracles. The possession of such roots was thought to ensure prosperity. (See Ducange, s.v. “Mandragora,” and Littré.)

Gerard, in 1597 (Herball, p. 280) described the male and female mandrakes. Dioscorides also recognizes two such plants apparently corresponding to the spring and autumn species (Μ. vernalis, Bert., and Μ. officinarum, I.., respectively), differing as he says in the colour of the foliage and shape of fruit. He alludes to the ‘ ‘ ridiculous tales” and “doltish dreames” about it merely to scout them. He notes that the root is often single, or with two to many branches. Even in his day, as now, the root of the wild bryony was trimmed to represent the human form, miscalled mandrake, and then sold as such to the ignorant.
