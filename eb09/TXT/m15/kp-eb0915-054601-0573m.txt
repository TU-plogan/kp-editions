MARINI, or Marino, Giambattista (1569-1625), Italian poet, was born at Naples on October 18, 1569. At an early age he secured the powerful patronage of Cardinal Aldobrandini, whom he accompanied from Rome to Ravenna and Turin. His ungoverned pen and disordered life compelled him to take refuge from 1615 to 1622 in Paris, where he was favourably recognized by Mary deâ€™ Medici. He died at Naples on March 25, 1625. See Italy, vol. xiii. p. 511.
