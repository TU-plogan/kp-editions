MADDEN, Sir Frederic (1801-1873), one of the first palaeographers and antiquaries of his time, and for nearly forty years assistant keeper and keeper of manuscripts at the British Museum, was born at Portsmouth on February 16, 1801, the son of an officer of Irish extraction. From his earliest years he displayed a strong bent to linguistic and antiquarian studies. In 1825 he was engaged in collating the text of Caedmon for the university of Oxford, and assisting Dr Bliss in editing Blore’s Monumental Remains ; in the following year he joined Mr Roscoe in preparing a catalogue of the earl of Leicester’s MSS. at Hoikham, which was completed in eight volumes folio, but remains unpublished. In the same year he was engaged by the British Museum to assist in the preparation of the classed catalogue of printed books at that time contemplated, and in 1828 he became assistant keeper of manuscripts. In 18β3 he was knighted, and in 1837 succeeded the Rev. Josiah Forshall as keeper of manuscripts, which office he continued to hold until his retirement in 1866. Notwithstanding his indefatigable attention to his official duties, he found time for a great amount of exceedingly valuable literary work. Between 1828 and 1838 he edited for the Roxburghe Club the old English romances of IIavelok the Dane (discovered by himself among the Laudian MSS. in the Bodleian) and William and the Werwolf and the old English versions of the Gesta Romanorum. In 1839 he edited the ancient metrical romances of Syr Gawayne for the Bannatyne Club, and in 1847 Layamon’s Brut, with a prose translation, for the Society of Antiquaries. In 1850 the magnificent edition of Wickliffe’s translations of the Scriptures from the original MSS., upon which he and his coadjutor, Mr Forshall, had been engaged for twenty years, was published by the university of Oxford. In 1866-69 he edited the Historia Minor of Matthew Paris for the Rolls series. In 1833 he prepared the literary part of Mr Shaw’s wo,rk on Illuminated Ornaments·, and in 1850 he edited the English translation of Silvestre’s Universal Palaeography. He had projected a history of chess in the Middle Ages; ill-health, however, and other causes, prevented the completion of the work. He died on March 8, 1873, bequeathing his journals and other private papers to the Bodleian Library, where they are to remain unopened until 1920.

Sir Frederic Madden’s attainments were great, and his services to literature highly distinguished. He was perhaps the first palaeographer of his day, and as keeper of manuscripts was most zealous and industrious, imposing a large amount of manual as well as intellectual labour upon himself, and continually, although too often unsuccessfully, exerting himself to enrich the collections committed to his care. He was an acute as well as a laborious antiquary, but rather qualified for critical than for original research, and his unacquaintance with German prevented his ranking high as a philologer, although he paid much attention to the early dialectical forms of French and English. His judgment was shown in the substantial value of the works edited by him. Wickliffe’s Bible is the first English version; Layamon’s Bηιt, a semi-Saxon paraphrase of the Norman Brut of Robert Wace, unites two ages of English poetry, is an inestimable monument of the language at the period of its composition, and possesses no small poetical merit; while Ηavelοk is hardly less important in a philological and a metrical point of view. The first volume of his edition of Matthew Paris contains a valuable critical introduction, and the third a biography of the historian, with an estimate of his place in literature. Sir Frederic’s minor contributions to antiquarian research were exceedingly numerous: the best known, perhaps, is his dissertation on the orthography of Shakespeare’s name, which, mainly on the strength of the Florio autograph, he contends should be “Shakspere.” This mode of spelling has been adopted by the New Shakspere Society. It is not generally known that Sir Frederic was the first to discover the “Perkins” forgeries in the duke of Devonshire folio Shakespeare, although private considerations induced him to leave the further elucidation of the matter to others. He also promptly detected the fabrications of the Greek Simonides, which had imposed upon some of the first scholars in Germany.
