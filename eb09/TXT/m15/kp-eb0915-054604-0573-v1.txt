MARION, Francis (1732-1795), American general, was born in 1732 at Winyah, near Georgetown, South Carolina. In 1759-61 he served as lieutenant in expeditions against the Cherokees, and in 1775 he was elected a member of the provincial congress of South Carolina. This voted two regiments of infantry, and Marion was elected captain in the second. He was made lieutenantcolonel after the defence of Fort Moultrie at the entrance of Charleston harbour (June 28, 1776), and was present at the unsuccessful attack on Savannah, September 1779. In August he joined Gates, but was detached a few days before Gates’s défeat at Camden on August 16; at Nelson’s Ferry, on the 20th, he rescued one hundred and fifty of the prisoners from a strong guard. He soon received a general’s commission. Pursued by Tarleton and Wemyss, he was driven to North Carolina, but soon returned. After successful skirmishes against superior forces, he formed a camp at Snow’s Island in the midst of the swamps of the Pedee and the Santee. In March 1781 he defeated Watson at Black River; but meanwhile Doyle had destroyed Marion’s camp. In April Lee and Marion took Fort Watson, and in May Fort Motte. In June Greene detached Sumter with Marion and others to make an incursion into the low country. At Quinby Marion’s men fought well against Coates; and in August he made a forced march to Parker’s Ferry and rescued Colonel Harden, pressed by a superior force. At Eutaw Springs he commanded the right under Greene. After the British retreat to Charleston, Marion went to an important session of the colonial assembly; on the very day that he returned to his brigade, February 24, 1782, it was surprised and dispersed, Marion arriving too late to recover the day. After the war he occupied himself with farming. He died February 27, 1795.
