MANUEL I., emperor of Trebizond, surnamed the Great Captain (b στpaτηγικωτaτo<s), was the second son of Alexius I., first emperor of Trebizond, and ruled from 1238 to 1263. Whatever may have been his military skill, or his personal character for bravery, he was unable to deliver his empire from vassalage first to the Seljuks and afterwards to the Mongols. He was the founder of the church and monastery of St Sophia at Trebizond. His predecessor was John I., Axuchus, and his eldest son, Andronicus II., succeeded him.

Manuel II., the descendant of Manuel I., reigned only a few months in 1322-33. Manuel III. reigned from 1390 to 1417, but the only interest attaching to his name arises from his connexion with Timur, whose vassal he was.

See Finlay, Mediaeval Greece and Trebizond, 1851.
