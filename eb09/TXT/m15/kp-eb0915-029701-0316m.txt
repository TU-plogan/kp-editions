MAINE, a province of France, was bounded on the N. by Normandy, on the W. by Brittany, on the S. by Anjou and Touraine, and on the E. by Orléanais; along with the northern part of Anjou it is now represented by the departments of Sarthe and Mayenne. Together with a portion of Perche which was conterminous with it on the northeast, and the countship of Laval on the west, it constituted a great military government, of which Le Mans was the capital. Before the Roman conquest Maine was held by the Aulerci Cenomani, whence probably its name. Le Mans, a great city, was connected by the conquerors by good roads with Chartres, Orleans, Vendome, Tours, Angers, Jublains (capital of the Aulerci Diablintes, inhabiting the western portion of Maine), and Sées. Under the later Caesars the Cenomani became almost independent, and joined the Armorican republic. Christianity was first introduced in the 3d century by St Julian, first bishop of Le Mans. Down to the time of Hugh Capet the bishops were the real rulers of the country; but in consequence of the incursions of the Northmen, who came up the Sarthe and Mayenne, the erection of strongholds became necessary, and Hugh C ’ Jpet made the countship of Maine hereditary in the person of Hugh I. One of the descendants of the latter, Count Herbert, having acknowledged the suzerainty of William, duke of Normandy, the people of Le Mans availed themselves of the absence of the Conqueror in England to rise against him, and were ultimately successful in gaining their freedom. Maine became united with Anjou by the marriage of its heiress with Fulk of Anjou, father of Geoffrey Plantagenet. Henry II. of England, the son of Geoffrey, was born at Le Mans. On the confiscation of the estates of King John, Maine passed to Philip Augustus of France; by Louis IX., the grandson of

Philip, it was handed over in 1245 to Charles, count of Provence, afterwards king of Naples; and in 1328 it was reunited to the domains of the crown by Philip of Valois, who was count of Maine. It was again separated by his grandson Louis of Anjou, the brother of King Charles V. During the Hundred Years’ War, Maine was a continual battlefield; the English were at last driven out by Dunois, who took possession of Le Mans in 1447. In 1481, on the death of Charles of Maine, the last scion of the house of Anjou, Maine was again united to the French crown by Louis XI. The province suffered much during the wars of religion; its strong places were dismantled by Henry IV. and Richelieu. At the Revolution the troops of La Vendée entered Maine, and took possession of Laval, Mayenne, and Le Mans at the end of 1793; after they had been defeated by the republican forces under Marceau and Westermann, their place was taken by the Chouans; and the pacification of the province, begun by General Hoche, was not completed until 1800. Towards the close of 1870 the second army of the Loire, retreating before the Prussians, was reformed in Maine, and in the neighbourhood of Le Mans one of the last great struggles in the Franco-German war took place in January 1871.
