MAHONY, Francis (1804-1866), “Father Prout,” Roman Catholic priest, scholar, journalist, song-writer, and humorist, was born at Cork of a respectable middleclass family in 1804. His classical education was chiefly obtained at a Jesuit college at Amiens, and after studying theology at Paris he received clerical ordination, and served in Switzerland and Ireland. He then came to London, and officiated for some time in the chapel of the Bavarian Legation. While there he fell in with the coterie of wits and men of letters who were then engaged on Fraser's Magazine, and, soon finding their society and pursuits more congenial to him than those of the Romish priesthood, he, about 1834, began to contribute his celebrated Prout papers to Fraser. These consist principally of translations of well-known English songs into Latin, Greek, French, and Italian verse, which he humorously represents as being the true originals from which the English authors had merely plagiarized them. The songs of France, and those of modern and ancient Italy (including among the latter many most felicitous renderings of Horace’s odes), were then given in English versions, accompanied by a running commentary full of queer humour and often acute criticism. Prout’s translations have been universally admired for the extraordinary command which they display of the various languages into which his renderings are made, and for their spirit and freedom both of thought and expression. Perhaps, however, the wonder at his polyglott learning has led to less attention than is deserved being paid to the remarkable excellence of many of his English versions of French and Latin odes. In happy abandon they are often almost unequalled, and most of them have all the unfettered character of original compositions. It might have been expected that with his great gift of poetical expression he would have left behind him more of what was exclusively his own. What he has given us in this line tends chiefly to show that with all his sarcastic and cynical wit his genius had also its tender, serious, and sentimental side. His “Bells of Shandon” have always been greatly admired; and “The Mistletoe,” “The Redbreast of Aquitaine,” “The Lady of Lee,” and the “Legend of Arethusa” are not without a certain sweetness and beauty. In 1846 Mahony became “own correspondent” at Rome to the Daily News, and his letters from that capital gave very vivid pictures, and contain much valuable and interesting information, of the first years, so full of liberal promise, of the reign of Pius IX. The last twelve or fifteen years of his life were spent at Paris, from which he supplied the Globe with a series of piquant letters on the incidents of the day. His death took place in May 1866. Mahony was not less distinguished as a conversationalist than as a writer. He had great stores of very various knowledge, had seen much of the world, and had a quick power of repartee and no end of sharp cynical wit. It is difficult to suppose that he could ever have been in his true place as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church. Bohemian as he was, however, he never separated himself from it, or seems to have lost his attachment to it; and it is creditable to his character that, though living much among scorners and indifferentists, he would never suffer injurious reflexions either upon his church or upon Christianity to pass without sharp rebuke.

The Reliques of Father Prout were collected from Fraser's Magazine and published in two handsome volumes in 1836, a considerably enlarged edition appearing in 1860. A biographical notice of him by his friend Mr Sheehan was prefixed to the Bentley Ballads ; and many additional details were given, with a considerable amount of his fugitive work contributed to the Daily News and the Globe, edited by Mr Blanchard Jerrold, in the Final Reliques of Father Prout, published in 1876.
