MEKONG, Mekiiong, or Makong, less frequently Nam-Kong, the Da-Kio of the Tibetans, the Lantsang-Kiang or Lankiang of the Chinese, and the Son-Kong of the Anamese, sometimes also called the Cambodia or Camboja, is one of the largest and most remarkable rivers of southern Asia. As it rises in Tibet, probably about 34° N. lat. and 94° E. long., and reaches the China Sea about 10° N. lat., after a somewhat devious course through Yunnan, Burmah, Siam, Cambodia, and Cochin-China, its total course may be safely stated at 2000 miles. In spite, however, of this great length, the Mekong must be regarded as little more than a mountain torrent on an unusually large scale. It certainly forms a very extensive delta (see Cochin-China, vol. vi. pp. 93, 94), and is navigable for steamboats as far up as Cratieh (about 280 miles from the river mouth), but navigation soon becomes difficult, not through want of water, but from the great irregularity of the bed. At Stung-Streng the river measures about 2 leagues from bank to bank, and its current is strong even to violence; it “twists into the sharpest eddies, and drives against the banks with fury.” A little higher up are the great cataracts of Kong. Beyond these the channel again becomes navigable as far as Bassac, when it is still about 6500 feet in width; but before long the banks close in and the river, narrowed to about 900 feet, pours along a current of extraordinary depth. Above Khemarat the rapids again begin. At Paklay, Mouhot describes the Mekong as larger than the Menam at Bangkok, forcing its way between the lofty mountains with a noise like the roaring of the sea. About 130 miles farther up, at Luang-Prabang, it has again an unobstructed channel about 3000 feet wide; above Sien-kong the river winds through a magnificent plain; but soon afterwards, in spite of its volume of water, it becomes less navigable than before. The great French expedition of 1866-67 touched its course only at one place higher up, Sien-hong; but other travellers have crossed it at various points in Yunnan. Mr Grosvenor found it, near Yung-feng-chang, at a height of 4700 feet above the sea, a stream of from 60 to 80 yards wide, flowing smoothly and steadily in the floor of a deep gorge (see Coleborne Baker, “Trav. and Res. in Western China,” Roy. Geog. Soc. Suppl. Papers, 1882). It is there crossed by an iron suspension bridge, of Chinese workmanship, consisting of twelve chains with links about 1 foot long (see Gill, River of Golden Sand, vol. ii. p. 330). Higher up, near Tse-ku mission-station, lies the terrific defile to which Cooper {Trav. of a Pioneer of Commerce, 1871) gave the name of Hogg’s Gorge. The head waters of the Mekong have never been traced to their source; but Hue and Gabet saw the confluence of the two main branches at Tsiamdo (32’ N. lat.), and the abbé Desgodins has followed the stream from that point down to Ye-tche in 27° 20' N. lat. (see La Mission du Thibet, Paris, 1872, and the abbé’s papers in Bull. Soc. G'eog., 1871, 1875, 1876, and 1877). At Yerkalo he observed a curious phenomenon: a number of wells from 12 to 24 feet deep were sunk down among the granite pebbles which form the bed of the river, just above mean-water mark; and they all yielded water with a greater or less degree of saltness and warmth. They are covered when the river is in full flood. The river basin in all the upper section is extremely narrow, being separated by long lines of high mountains from the valley of the Salwin on the west and from that of the Chin-sha-kiang or River of Golden Sands on the east. Not till the comparatively low country of ι Siam is reached are there any affluents of considerable size. The most important are the Se-mùn and the Udong on the right, and the Attopeu or Se-Kong on the left. The Se-mιin or Ubon river was explored as far as Korat by the Lagrée expedition, and its tributary the Se-dém has been followed by Dr Harmand {Bull. Soc. G'eog., 1877). Both streams have a rapid and interrupted course. Like the Nile, the Mekong is subject to a great annual inundation, described as early as the 16th century by Camoens, who calls the river Mecom. At some places the difference between flood-mark and ordinary level is from 35 to 40 feet (see Cochin-China). The first Europeans to make true acquaintance with the river course were the Dutchman ΛVusthoff and his fellow ambassadors, who in 1641 ascended as far as Winkyan, i.e., Vienchang; their narrative is given by Yalentijn, and might have been enough to suggest that the Mekong could not form a trade route to the interior. For the French exploration which finally settled the question, see Garnier’s Expedition, <tc., 1873, and the notice of Garnier in vol. x. p. 82.
