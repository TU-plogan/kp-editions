MASCHERONI, Lorenzo (1750-1800), an Italian geometer, was professor of mathematics at the university of Pavia, and published a variety of mathematical works, the best-known of which is his Geometria del Compasso (Pavia, 1797), a body of constructive geometry in which the use of the circle alone is postulated. Many of the solutions are most ingenious, and some of the constructions of considerable practical importance.

The English reader will find a copious extract from Mascheroni’s work in Leslie’s Geometry, 3d ed., p. 204. There is a French translation by Carette (Paris, 1798), who also wrote a biography of Mascheroni.
