MÁLWÁ, an historical province of Central India, roughly coextensive with the western portion of the Central India agency, is bounded on the N. by Hindustan Proper, on the E. by Bundelkhand, on the S. by the Deccan, and on the W. by Râjputâna. It consists of an upland region, with many fertile valleys, included within the main rivers of the Ganges, the Sôn, the Chambal, and the Nerbudda. In prehistoric times the capital was the ancient city of Ujain (Oojein), associated in Hindu legend with the great king Vikramâditya, the date of whose accession (57 b.c.) has given the “Samvat” era to all India. The Mohammedan chronicler Ferishta describes Mâlwâ as the kingdom of an independent râjâ, when Mahmùd of Ghazni invaded India in the beginning of the 11th century. I.· appears to have first fallen into the hands of the Moslems about 1309, during the reign of the Delhi emperor Alâ-ud-din. When the Tughlak dynasty was weakened by the repeated attacks of the Mughals, their viceroy in Mâlwâ succeeded in establishing his independence. The first Moslem king of Mâlwâ was Dilâwar Khân Ghori, of Afghân origin, who ruled from 1387 to 1405, and placed his capital at Mandu. He was succeeded by his son Hosharιg Ghori, to whom are attributed most of the magnificent ruins still to be seen at Mandu. In 1526 the Ghori dynasty came to an end, being overthrown by Bahâdur Shàh of Guzerât; and in 1570 Mâlwâ was, on the conquest of Guzerât by the emperor Akbar, incorporated in the Mughal dominions. On the decay of the Delhi empire in the 18th century, Mâlwâ was one of the first provinces to be overrun by the Mahrattas. In 1737 the peshwâ exacted chauth, or one-fourth of the revenue, and at a later date the two great military chiefs Sindhia and Holkar carved out for themselves kingdoms, which their descendants still retain. But the Mahrattas set up no organized government, so that Mâlwâ, besides its native population of predatory Bhils, became the refuge of all the mercenary bandits of the peninsula. In the beginning of the present century, the depredations of these bandits or Pindâris led to what is sometimes known as the fourth Mahratta war of 1817, under the governor-generalship of Lord Hastings. As the result, the Pindâris were extirpated; and under the rule of Sir John Malcolm the Bhils were tamed, and the jungles were cleared of wild beasts. Many of the Bhils have been enlisted as British soldiers; and the headquarters of the Mâlwâ Bhil corps is at Sardârpur. At the present day Mâlwâ is best known as giving its name to the opium which is annually exported from Bombay to the amount of about 37,000 chests.
