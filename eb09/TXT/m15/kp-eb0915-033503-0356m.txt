MALLOW, a municipal and parliamentary borough, market-town, and watering-place in the county of Cork, Ireland, is situated on the Blackwater, 150 miles southwest from Dublin, and 20 north from Cork. The town owes its prosperity to its beautiful situation in a fine valley surrounded by mountains, and to its tepid mineral spring, which is very efficacious for general debility and for scorbutic and consumptive complaints. A spa-house with pump-room and baths was erected in 1828. Besides the parish church in the Later English style, erected in 1818, the principal buildings of the town are the court-house, the work-house and infirmary, and the bridewell. There are a manufactory of mineral water, a condensed-milk manufactory, com-mills, and tanneries. Mallow received a charter of incorporation from James I. The population of the borough in 1871 was 4165, and in 1881 it was 4437.
