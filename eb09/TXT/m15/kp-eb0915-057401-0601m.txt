MARSH, George Perkins, LL.D. (1801-1882), American diplomatist and philologist, was born at Woodstock, Vermont, March 17, 1801, graduated at Dartmouth College in 1820, and practised law at Burlington, Vermont, devoting himself also with ardour to philological studies. In 1835 he was elected to the State legislature, and in 1842 he became a member of Congress. In 1849 he was appointed United States minister to Turkey, and in 1852 discharged also a special mission to Greece, returning to Vermont in 1853. In 1861 he became United States minister to Italy, and died in that office at Vallombrosa, July 24, 1882.

His chief published works are a Compendious Grammar of the Old Northern or Icelandic Language, 1838, compiled and translated from the grammar of Rask; The Camel, his Organization, Habits, and Uses, 1856; Lectures on the English Language, 1861; The Origin and History of the English Language, 1862; Man and Nature, 1864. The last-named work, largely rewritten, was issued under the title The Earth as Modified by Human Action in 1874.
