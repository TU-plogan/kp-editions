MARLBOROUGH, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Wiltshire, England, situated on the great highroad between London and Bath, and distant 75 miles from the former, 32 from the latter, and 13 from Devizes. It stands on the left bank of the Kennet, a tributary of the Thames, in 51° 25' N. lat. and l o 43' W. long. It is an agricultural centre, and has a weekly market. In the days of its prosperity forty-two public coaches halted daily at its doors, and it had a fair trade in corn and malt; but its traffic was to a great extent diverted by the opening of the Great Western Railway, and it now carries on a very small trade in tanning, rope-making, and malting. It consists mainly of a long and broad street, terminated at one end by St Mary’s church and the town-hall, and at the other by St Peter’s church and the college. The municipal council consists of a mayor, four aidermen, and twelve councillors, and the borough returns one member to parliament[9:15:553]. In 1881 the population of the municipal borough (area 186 acres) was 3343, and of the parliamentary borough (area 4665 acres) 5180.

The name has been a frequent matter for discussion, some declaring it to be the hill (berg) or fortress (burg) of Merlin the Briton, others the Marl borough, in allusion to the surrounding soil, which, however, is chalk. A great British mound exists at the south-west extremity of the town, and a castle was erected around it by William the Conqueror. This became a somewhat notable place. Henry I. kept Easter here in 1110, and Henry II. granted it to John Lackland. Henry III. held his last parliament here in 1267, and passed the “Statutes of Marleberge.” Later the castle served as an occasional royal residence; it was probably dismantled during the Wars of the Roses. The town was besieged and taken during the civil wars, and a few years later (1653) was almost entirely consumed by fire. A large mansion was erected by Lord Seymour in the reign of Charles II. near the site of the castle, and this, after various vicissitudes, was in 1843 converted into “Marlborough College,”—a public school designed mainly for the education of the sons of the clergy. A large group of buildings— chapel, schools, dining hall, racket courts, &c.—soon sprung up around the original building, and the school numbered five hundred and eighty in 1882.
