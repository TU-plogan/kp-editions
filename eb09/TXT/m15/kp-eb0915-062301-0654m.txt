MAS ‘ÚDY. Abii’l-Hasun ‘All ibn Hosein ibn 'All el-Mas'ιidy,^[1. The surname is derived from an ancestor Mas'ud, a Meccan, whose son 'Abdalla accompanied Mohammed on his flight to Medina, and is often mentioned in the history of the prophet. Details as to the family are given by Reiske, Ann. Mos., vol. i., note 208. ] was born at Baghdad towards the close of the 9th Christian century. Great part of his life was spent in travel; in 912-13 a.d. he was at Mültân in the Punjab, and also visited Mansura. Three years later he was at Basra and met Abu Zeid, the geographer whose remarks on the extreme East are comprised in Beinaud’s Relation des Voyages (Paris, 1845). His writings and those of Mas'ιidy are indebted each to the other. In the interval it would seem our traveller had gained that personal acquaintance with Fars and Susiana, and that knowledge of the books of the Persians, of which he speaks in his writings. Once more turning eastward he was at Cambay in 915-16, and soon after at Saimιir. Hence he pushed on to Ceylon and sailed to Madagascar, returning to Omân in 916—17. In the introduction to the Meadows he seems also to say that he had journeyed as far as China. A northern journey carried Mas'ùdy as far as the Caspian Sea. In 926 he was at Palestine, where his curiosity, not limited by religious prejudice, led him to visit the Christian church and describe its relics. In 943-44 he made a careful study of the ruins of Antioch, and subsequently proceeded to Basra. In the same year he composed the Meadows of Gold. The last ten years of his life were passed in Syria and Egypt. His last work, The Indicator and Monitor, was written 345 a.h., and his death took place in Egypt the same year (956-57 a.d.). ^[2. See De Sacy, Chrest., 1st ed., ii. 490. ] The vast journeys of Mas⅛dy did not pass beyond the lines of commercial enterprise among the Moslems of those days, when Trâk was not unjustly held to be the centre of the world, and the arms, the trade, and the religion of Islâm penetrated to the remotest parts of Asia and Africa. But Mas'ùdy did not travel for gain. His object was to study with his own eyes the peculiarities of every land, and to collect whatever was of interest for archaeology, history, and manners. Singularly free from bigotry—he was himself a Mo'tazilite, one of the heretical sect, as they were reckoned, who held the doctrine of man’s free will— he was ready to derive information even from the writings of infidel Persians or of a Christian bishop.^[3. In the Meadows, iii. 69, he tells us that at Fostat (Ohl Cairo), in 336 a.h. , there fell into his hands a chronicle (now lost) by Godmer, bishop of Gironne, which he uses for his narrative. ] In the range of his observations and the naive uncritical honesty with which he records them he has naturally suggested comparison with Herodotus, and so competent a judge as Ibn Khaldιin gives him the title of imâm of Eastern historians, an epithet precisely parallel to that borne by Herodotus among the historians of the West. The parallel, however, must be taken with great deductions. Of the Meadows, the work by which Mas'ιidy is chiefly known, by far the greater part is an historical compilation, enlivened indeed in some parts by personal recollection of places and the like, but mainly drawn from a vast mass of earlier books^[4. Of these the first chapter gives an interesting catalogue. ] which are used in the common paste-and scissors faslιion of Eastern history. Even in the earlier cosmographical chapters the author’s vast and miscellaneous reading, which included the Arabic translations of Ptolemy and other Greek writers, is mingled with his original observa-tιons[9:15:624] in that ill-digested style so often characteristic of men of prodigious acquisitive power; and the presentation of facts falls as far short of freshness and the artistic charm of the inimitable Grecian raconteur as the shapeless details of universal history, as it appeared to the Moslem, fall short of the epic interest of the great struggle for supremacy between Eran and Hellas.

Mas'tidy lias himself sketched his literary activity in the opening chapter of the Meadows and in his last book The Indicator. In his huge Annals {Akhbàr el-Zemän) and in a second work of less extent {Kitdb el-Awsaf) which followed it he summed up the whole cosmographical and geographical science of his age. These works are lost or known only by fragments, but we possess an abridgment in the author’s third great work The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Precious Stones, of which there are many MSS. in European libraries. It was printed by Barbier de Meynard with a French translation, 9 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1861-77, and at Bιilakin 1867 (2 vols, folio). The first volume of an English translation by Sprenger appeared at London in 1841; but the work was not continued. The Kιtab-el-Tanbih {Indicator and Monitor) exists in MS. at Paris, and has been fully described by De Sacy in Notices et Extraits, vol. viii., 1810 (reprinted at the end of the Paris edition of the Meadows, where a list of other works of our author is given). See also Quatremère in Jour. As. for January 1839, and the article “Masoudy,” by Reiuaud, in the Nouv. Biog. Générale.
