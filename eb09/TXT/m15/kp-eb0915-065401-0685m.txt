MAZZARA DEL VALLO, a city of Italy, on the coast of Sicily, in the province Trapani, 13 miles by rail southeast of Marsala. It is surrounded by a wall 37 feet in height, strengthened by towers rising at intervals; audit possesses a castle and a cathedral, both founded by Count Roger in the 11th century. The harbour is spacious but badly sheltered from the south winds. The population of the city was 11,756 in 1871; that of the commune was 10,999 in 1861 and 13,505 in 1881.

Mazara or Mazaris appears from Diodorus Siculus (xiii. 54) to have been a trading establishment of Selinus, and it was captured by the Carthaginian general in 409 b.c. on his march against that city. It was in this neighbourhood that the Saracens landed in 827 A.D.; and the name of Vai di Mazzara long indicated one of the three divisions of Sicily.
