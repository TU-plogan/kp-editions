MELENDEZ VALDES, Juan (1754-1817), minor poet of Spain, was born at Ribera del Fresno, Badajoz, on March 11, 1754. He was destined by his parents, who were in good circumstances, for an official career; and accordingly, after having completed his preliminary education at Madrid and Segovia, he went to Salamanca, and duly graduated in laws. At an early age he had begun to write verses in imitation of the then much admired though now justly forgotten Eugenio Lobo; but at Salamanca he came under the influence of the purer literary taste of the elder Moratin, while to the friendship of the cultivated and well-read Cadahalso he owed his introduction to the writings of recent English poets. At the age of twenty-six Melendez obtained the prize of the Spanish Academy for the best eclogue, one of the unsuccessful competitors being the well-known Iriarte; the poem (Batilo: egloga en alabanzade la vida del campo, 1780) continues to be highly spoken of by native critics, who echo in various forms the remark of one of the adjudicators, that it was “redolent of the wild thyme.” In 1781 Melendez went to Madrid, where Jovellanos became his friend, and obtained for him in 1783 the appointment of professor of the humanities at Salamanca. In 1784, in competition for a prize offered by the city of Madrid, he produced his longest poem, a “dramatic eclogue” entitled Las Bodas de Camacho (“Camacho’s Wedding”), which secured the vote of the judges, but did not add to his reputation, and soon fell into neglect. His genius does not seem to have been at all dramatic; at any rate he was unfortunate in his choice of a subject so little capable of dramatic treatment as the well-known episode in Don Quixote. In the following year, at the age of thirty-one, he published a little volume of lyrics and pastorals which gave him the first place he still holds among Spanish poets of the 18th century. Several editions were exhausted in a single year. Μ ith poetical fame came professional advancement, and in 1789 the “Restorer of Parnassus” (Restaurador del Parnaso), as Melendez is sometimes pedantically called by his countrymen, received a judicial appointment at Saragossa, which in 1791 he exchanged for a chancery [9:15:840] auditorship at Valladolid. In 1797 the publication of a new and greatly enlarged edition of his works, dedicated to the prince of the peace, was followed by his removal to Madrid to a high post in connexion with the treasury. The new poems included somewhat heavy philosophical epistles written after the manner of Young, and an unmistakably dull epic canto entitled Caida de Luzbel (“The Fall of Lucifer”), suggested by Milton, as well as an Ode to Winter, which showed how well the author had made himself acquainted with Thomson. On the fall of his friend Jovellanos in 1798 Melendez was ordered away from Madrid, first to Medina del Campo and afterwards to Zamora, and it was not till 1802 that he was permitted to settle in Salamanca. For the next six years his literary activity was but slight, being limited to the production of a short poem on “Creation” and the preparation of an unfinished translation of the Aeneid. After the revolution of Aranjuez (1808) Melendez accepted from King Joseph the post of councillor of state and afterwards that of minister of public instruction, a failure of patriotism which involved him in many indignities and even dangers; in 1813 he was of course compelled to quit his country, and, after sojourning successively at Alais, Nîmes, and Toulouse, he died in considerable poverty and neglect at Montpellier, on May 24, 1817. During his exile he employed himself in the preparation of a complete edition of his works, with numerous additions and corrections; this was afterwards published, along with a life of the author by Quintana, at the expense of the Government (4 vols. 8vo, Madrid, 1820; reprinted at Paris, 1832, and at Barcelona, 1838).
