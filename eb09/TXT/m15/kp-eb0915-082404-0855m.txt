MEDYN, a district town of Russia, situated in the government of Kaluga, 39 miles north-west of the capital of the province, on the highway from Moscow to Warsaw. It was formerly known under the name of Mezetsk, and in the 14th century formed part of the Smolensk principality. The soil of the surrounding country being rather infertile, the population is engaged to some extent in manufactures of linen, cotton, and paper, and the merchants of Medyn carry on a brisk trade in this produce, as well as in rye, oats, and hemp seed. The population is 8000.
