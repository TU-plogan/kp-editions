MAURY, Matthew Fontaine (1806-^873), American naval officer and lιydrograplιer, was born in Spottsylvania county, Virginia, January 14, 1806. In 1825 he entered the American navy as midshipman, circumnavigating the globe in the “Vincennes,” during a cruise of four years. In 1836 he was made lieutenant, and gazetted astronomer to an exploring expedition. In 1839 he met with an accident which resulted in permanent lameness, and unfitted him for active service. Maury was placed in charge of the Depot of Charts and Instruments, out of which have grown the United States Naval Observatory and the Hydrographic Office. He laboured assiduously and with complete success to place the depot in a state of efficiency. While in the “Vincennes,” and in subsequent cruises, Maury made many observations as to the winds and currents, and when in charge of the Hydrographic Office he set himself to collect further data by distributing to captains of vessels specially prepared log-books. So successful was he in this enterprise that in the course of nine years he had collected a sufficient number of logs to make two hundred manuscript volumes, each with about two thousand five hundred days’ observations. One result was to show the necessity for combined action on the part of maritime nations in regard to ocean meteorology. This led to an [9:15:643] international conference at Brussels in 1853, which produced the greatest benefit to navigation as well as indirectly to meteorology. One result was the establishment of the meteorological department of the English Board of Trade, now known as the Meteorological Office, which adopted Maury’s model log-books. In 1853 he published his Letters on the Amazon and Atlantic Slopes of South America, and in 1855 he was promoted to the rank of commander. On the outbreak of the American civil war in 1861, Maury threw in his lot with the South, and, having lost nearly his all, retired to England, where he was presented with a handsome testimonial raised by public subscription. Afterwards he became imperial commissioner of emigration to Maximilian of Mexico, on whose death he took up his residence in Virginia, where he died on February 1, 1873.

In 1848 Maury published a Treatise on Navigation, which was long used as a text-book in the United States navy. The work, however, by which he is best known is his Physical Geography of the Sea, the first edition of which was published in London in 1855, and in New York in 1856; it was translated into several European languages. The theories which it contains are now generally admitted to be quite erroneous. Maury’s reputation rests on the eminent services he rendered to navigation and meteorology, he having been the first to show how the latter could be raised to the certainty of a science. He was essentially a practical man; his great aim was to render navigation more secure and economical, and in this he was eminently successful. Other works published by Maury are the papers contributed by him to the Astronomical Observations of the United States Observatory, Letters concerning Lincs for Steamers crossing the Atlantic (1854), Physical Geography (1864), and Manual of Geography (1871). In 1859 he began the publication of a series of nautical monographs.
