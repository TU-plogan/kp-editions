MARLBOROUGH, a town of the United States, in Middlesex county, Massachusetts, about 25 miles west from Boston, with stations on the Old Colony and the Fitchburg Railways. It lies in a fertile hilly district, and contains a beautiful sheet of water 160 acres in extent, known as Williams Lake. Shoemaking is the staple industry, some of the factories in the department rivalling the largest in the world. There is a good public library; and three weekly newspapers are published in the town. The population increased from 8474 in 1870 to 10,126 in 1880. Marlborough, colonized by settlers from Sudbury in 1655, and incorporated in 1661, occupies the site of the Christian Indian village of Okommakamesitt.
