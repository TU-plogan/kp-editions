MARONITES (Syriac, Môrûnbyè ; Arabic, Mawàrinai), an ecclesiastical community, and therefore also, according to the usage of the Christian East, a distinct political or social body, found mainly in or near the Lebanon, acknowledging the headship of the pope and the Latin standard of orthodoxy, but still retaining some peculiar privileges, including the use of a Syriac service—which few even of the priests now understand—and permission for the inferior clergy to marry. Maronite writers, trained either at Rome (in the Maronite college, founded by Gregory XIII. in 1584) or under Roman influences, have not unnaturally striven to prove that their church was always in essential accord with the Church of Rome except in ritual, but there is clear evidence that this is incorrect. The earliest references to the Maronites (beginning in the 8th century) leave no doubt that they were Monothelites, and there is contemporary evidence (William of Tyre) that they only abjured their heresies in 1182, when with their patriarch and some bishops they joined the Latin Church. Even in later times it has cost Rome much pains and money to attach them closely to herself and produce real conformity to Latin or ultimately to Tridentine orthodoxy. The origin of the Maronites and their earlier history are obscure. The name is no doubt connected with the monastery of St Maron, near the source of the Orontes, one of the chief monasteries of Syria in the 6th century;^[1. The ruins of this placé are described by Robinson, Bib. Researches. iii. 539; Renan, Phénicie, p. 119.] the Maronites themselves (Assemani, Bib. Or., i. 496 sq.) have much to tell of their great patriarch John Maron, or rather John of Maron, who studied at the convent of St Maron, converted the Lebanon to orthodoxy, and died 707 a.d. Much of the history of this personage is certainly fabulous.^[2. The John of Maron known to Bar-Hebraeus (Chron. Eccles., i. 463), and placed in the 10th century, was apparently a Monophysite. That Monophysite as well as Monothelite doctrine was once current among th -. Maronites appears.from various things in their ecclesiastical books, which they now try to explain away or reject as interpolations.]

Though the Maronite college at Rome sent forth some distinguished scholars—the grammarian Amira, Gabriel Sionita, Abraham Ecchellensis, and the three Assemanis— the Maronite community never took on much Western culture. A simple warlike race, they long maintained a great measure of internal freedom under their native nobility, only paying tribute to the pasha of Tripoli; and for a time, when the princely house of Shihâb left Islam and became Maronites, they greatly outweighed the Druses in their influence in the Lebanon.^[3. See Niebuhr, Reisebeschr., vol. ii.; Volney, Voyage ; Robinson, Researches, ii. 506. »] Since the fall, in 1840, of the Maronite emir Beshir, who was only by outward profession a Moslem, their power has sunk. For their subsequent history see vol. vii. p. 486, and for statistics, &c., at the present time, see Lebanon.

The seat of the Maronite patriarch is at Kann6bin (Coenobium); the bishoprics are Aleppo, Baalbek, Jebeil, Tripoli, Ehden, Damascus, Bei nit, Tyre, and Cyprus.
