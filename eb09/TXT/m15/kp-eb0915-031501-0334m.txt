MALACHY, St (c. 1094-1148), otherwise known as Maelmaedog Ua Morgair, for some time archbishop of Armagh, and afterwards papal legate in Ireland, was born of noble parentage at Armagh about the year 1094, early gained a high reputation for sanctity, and was ordained to the priesthood at the age of twenty-five (thirty being at that time, according to his biographer St Bernard, the canonical age). For some time he was employed as vicar by Archbishop Celsus or Ceallach of Armagh, and in this capacity was successful in effecting throughout the diocese many important reforms in the direction of increased conformity with the usage of the Church of Rome; afterwards he undertook the government of the decayed monastery of Bangor or Benchor, in what is now known as county Down, and made it a flourishing seminary of learning and piety. When thirty years of age he was chosen and consecrated bishop of Connor; after the sack of that place by the king of Ulster he withdrew into Munster and built the monastery of Ibrac. Meanwhile he had been designated by Celsus (in whose family the see of Armagh had been hereditary for many years) to succeed him in the archbishopric; reluctantly but dutifully in the interests of reform he accepted the dignity, and thus became involved for some years in a struggle with the so-called heirs. Having finally settled the diocese he, as had been previously stipulated by himself, was permitted to return to his former diocese, or rather, it having in the meanwhile been divided, to the smaller and poorer portion of it, the bishopric of Down, where he reorganized a house of regular clergy. In 1139 he set out from Ireland with the purpose of soliciting from the pope the pallium for the archbishop of Armagh; on his way to Rome he visited Clairvaux, and thus began a life-long friendship with St Bernard, who survived to write his biography. Malachy was received by Innocent II. with great honour, and made legate in Ireland, though he did not at once obtain the pallium; on his way homeward he revisited Clairvaux, and took with him from thence four members of the Cistercian order, by whom the abbey of Mellifont was afterwards founded in 1141. For the next eight years after his return from Rome Malachy was active in the discharge of his legatine duties, and in 1148 he received from the bishops of Ireland a commission to return to Rome and make fresh application for the pallium; he did not, however, get beyond Clairvaux, where he died on November 2, 1148. The object of his life was realized four years afterwards, in 1152,. during the legateship of his successor (see Ireland, vol. xiii. p. 255). Malachy was canonized by Clement IV.
