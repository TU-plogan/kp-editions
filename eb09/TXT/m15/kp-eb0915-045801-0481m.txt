MÁNBHÚM, a district in the lieutenant-gôvernorship of Bengal, India, lying between 22° 37' and 24° 3' N. lat., and 85° 5Γ and 87° 16' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Hazâribâgh and Birbhιim, on the E. by Bardwân and Bûnkura, on the S. by Singbhùm and Midnapur, and on the W. by Lohârdagû and Hazâribâgh. It has an area of 4147 square miles. The headquarters station is at Purulia. Mânbhûm district forms the first step of a gradual descent from the table-land of Chutiâ Nâgpur to the delta of lower Bengal. In the northern and eastern portions the country is open, and consists of a series of rolling downs, dotted here and there with isolated conical hills. The soil is for the most part composed of hard, dry, ferruginous gravel, but many of the lower levels are filled with good alluvial soil, which yields a fine rice crop. In the western and southern tracts the country is more broken, and the scenery much more picturesque. The principal hills are Dalmâ (3407 feet), the crowning peak of a range of the same name; Gangâbari or Gajboro (2220 feet), the highest peak of the Baghmûndi range, about 20 miles south-west of Purulia; and Pânchkot or Pânchet (1600 feet), on the summit of which stands the old palace of the râjâs of Pânchet. The hills are all covered with dense jungle. The chief riveris the Kasâi, which flows through the district from north-west to south-east into Midnapur, and on which a considerable floating trade in sàl timber is carried on. The useful timber found in Mânbhûm is very limited in quantity, and with the present rate of decrease the supply cannot last many years. Tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, and jackals are not uncommon; various kinds of deer abound; and bison are occasionally met in the south of the district. Elephants come every year from the south-east into the hilly country between Mânbhûm and Singbhûm.

The census of 1872 returned, the population at 820,521. The aboriginal tribes numbered about 100,000, Hindus nearly 700,000, and Mohammedans about 30,000. In 1881 the population was 1,042,117. A large proportion of the aborigines are now semi-Hinduized. The most numerous aboriginal tribe are the Santals; but the Bhûmij Kols are the characteristic aboriginal race. In Mânbhûm they inhabit the country lying on both sides of the Subarnarekha. They are pure Mundas, but their compatriots to the east have dropped the title of Munda and the use of their distinctive language, have adopted Hindu customs, and are fast becoming Hindus in religion. The Bhûmij Kols of the Jungle Mahals were once the terror of the surrounding districts; they are now a more peaceful tribe, but have lost to a great extent the simplicity and truthfulness of character for which their cognates are generally distinguished. Among high-caste Hindus about 50,000 are Brahmans and 16,000 Rajputs. The Kevmιis, who are agriculturists, form the most numerous caste in the district. The Christian population numbers about 600, most of whom are engaged in agriculture. Mânbhûm is a thoroughly rural district, and contains only two towns with upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely Purulia and Raghunathpur,. and three others with over 2000, namely Jhâlidâ, Kâsipur, and Mânbâzâr.

Three principal crops of rice are grown, one sown broadcast early in May on table-lands and the tops of ridges, an autumn crop, and a winter crop, the last forming the 'chief harvest of the district. Other crops are wheat, barley, Indian corn, pulses, oilseeds, linseeds, jute, hemp, sugar-cane, indigo, pan, and tobacco. Owing to the completeness of the natural drainage floods are unknown, but the country is liable to droughts caused by deficient rainfall. The principal articles of export are oilseeds, pulses, ghi, lac, indigo, tasar silk (manufactured near Raghunâthpur), timber, resin, coal, and (in good seasons) rice. The chief imports are salt, piece goods, brass utensils, and unwrought iron. Cotton hand-loom weaving is carried on all over the district. Coal is found at Iharia, a few miles from Parasnâth. The total revenue of Mânbhûm district in 1881 amounted to £25,760, of which £7562 was obtained from land, and £6424 from excise. The schools in 1877 numbered 392, with 9616 pupils. The climate of the district is fairly healthy. The average rainfall for the ten years ending 1880-81 was 55 ’ 95 inches.
