MARCH, the third month of our modern year, contains thirty-one days. As in the Roman year so in the English ecclesiastical calendar used till 1752 this was the first month, and the legal year commenced on the 25th of March. The Romans called this month Martius, from the god Mars; and it received the name Illyd Monath, i.e., loud or stormy month, from the Anglo-Saxons. In France March was also generally reckoned the first month of the year until 1564, when, by an edict of Charles IX., January was decreed to be thenceforth the first month. Scotland followed the example of France in 1599; but in England the change did not take place before 1752. There is an old saying, common to both England and Scotland, which represents March as borrowing three days from April; thus the last three days of March are called the “borrowing” or the “borrowed days.” In the Complaynt of Scotland we find “the borial blastis of the thre borouing dais of Marche bed chaisset the fragrant Anreise of evyrie fruit-tree far athourt the feildis.” An ancient popular rhyme says

“March borrowit from Averill Three days, aud they were ill;” anl then there is another rhyme which graphically characterizes those three “ill” days in detail :—

“The first, it sail be wind and weet, The next, it sail be snaw and sleet; The third, it sail be sic a freeze, Sall gar the birds stick to the trees.”

There is an old proverb, “A bushel of March dust is worth a king’s ransom.” Dry weather in March is generally favourable to the production of grain on clay lands; and hence a “dusty March” portended a plenteous season; while, on the contrary, a “wet March” frequently proved destructive of both wheat and rye.

The principal fixed days now observed and noted in the course of this month are the following :—March 1st, St David; March 12th, St Gregory; March 17th, St Patrick; and March 25th, Lady Day, one of the established quarter-days in England.
