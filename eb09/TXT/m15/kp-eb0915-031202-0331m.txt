MALACCA. The town of Malacca lies on the southwest coast of the Malay Peninsula, in 2° 14' N. lat. and [9:15:313] 102° 12' E. long. It is situated on a small river bearing its name, which separates it into two parts. That on the right bank is occupied by the old Dutch town, and that on the left by the business quarter, which is connected with the former by a small bridge, and is chiefly inhabited by Chinese and native traders. The view of Malacca from the harbour is picturesque and pleasing to the eye. From Flagstaff Hill on the left—whose slopes are always of a bright emerald green—to St John’s Hill on the right, on which stand the ruins of the old “Dutch redoubt,”—hidden in a mass of wild vegetation,—stretches for a distance of about half a mile a row of spacious dwelling houses belonging to European and wealthy Chinese and Arab residents. These houses are roofed with neat red tiles, and have windows opening to a stone verandah facing the sea. Each house is surrounded by a large “compound,” laid out with a flower garden in front and a “plantation” or orchard at the back. Adjoining this European quarter lies a large suburb of native and other dwellings almost concealed in a dense forest of beautiful fruit trees. Behind this we see a prominent green hill, formerly used as a fort, and now as a Chinese burial-ground, and beyond this the horizon is hemmed in by a long chain of the Bruong and Rumbow Hills, while far in the extreme east rises the jagged cone of Mount Ophir, blue as sapphire in the distance.

Since the destruction (in 1807) of the old Portuguese fort erected by Albuquerque, the “antiquities” of Malacca are reduced to a mere name. At the foot of Flagstaff Hill, however, are the remains of the massive wall which surrounded the hill, with an arched and carved gateway. On the summit of the hill, where a fine view is had of the harbour and the Water Islands, are the ruins of the first Christian church planted in Malayan territory, and also a portion of the old convent. At the back of this hill to the right may be noted the barracks, hospital, and convict lines, and massing under some fine “ansana” trees—the shady elms of the East—we reach the garden of the old Dutch stadthouse, and then a green square, facing which are the court-house and other Government buildings, and the old Dutch church. All these buildings have sloping roofs covered with small square, tiles after the Dutch style of architecture of the 16th century. This is quite a unique example of Dutch domestic architecture in the East, and several of the adjoining streets still bear their Dutch designation, as “Heren Straat,” “Jonker •Strait,” &c. The stadthouse is approached by a fine flight of stone steps, forming a covered way to the upper rooms. These are occupied by the governor of the Straits Settlements and the judge during their annual or biennial visits, and those in the lower story are used as Government offices. From the interesting ruins of the Dutch redoubt on St John’s Hill an extensive view may be had of the country running around and to the north and south of Malacca. Its general aspect in the immediate vicinity is that of a flat country covered with luxuriant “dusoons” or plantations of fruit trees, and extensive forests of tall timber; beyond this is an open country, interspersed with •extensive plantations of tapioca, which at a distance resemble fields of clover; then follow rice-fields, and marshes or fens, and at the foot of the hills patches of virgin forest, the whole being walled in by a range of blue hills. The climate of Malacca is very healthy, and the thermometer in the shade ranges from 72° to 84° or even 90° Fahr. The population, which is not very large, consists of Malays of the surrounding countries, of Malacca Portuguese (the mixed descendants of early Portuguese settlers), of Chinese proper and a large number born of Malay mothers. There is also a sprinkling of natives of India and of Arabs. The Malacca Portuguese employ themselves as fishermen, servants, and clerks: the rest are chiefly engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits.

In consequence of its shallow harbour, Malacca has been completely outstripped as a seaport by Singapore and Penang, though it still carries on a brisk trade with the surrounding countries in Malacca canes, stuffed birds of beautiful plumage, poultry, and large quantities of the most luscious fruits. The import and export returns, show a large apparent increase in the trade,—the imports in 1880 amounting to $3,817,848 (£812,308), and the exports to $3,634,640, as against an average of $2,505,175 and $2,577,020 respectively for 1869-72; and, though Malacca has been a drag on the revenue of the colony generally, a marked increase is shown in the principal items of revenue, viz., in land rents, tenths in paddy, tapioca, and fruits, royalty on timber, and survey fees. In 1880 the revenue was $182,323, and the expenditure $174,333, while the income and expenditure of the municipality in the same year were $22,428 and $18,899 respectively. The Government is improving the drainage of the country by clearing its natural water course. The municipality has no debts, and the general progress of the settlement during the year ending 1880 must be regarded as satisfactory, with an increase under almost every heading of revenue that bids fair to continue.
