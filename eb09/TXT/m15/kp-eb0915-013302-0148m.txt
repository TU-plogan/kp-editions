MACCULLOCH, Horatio (1805-1867), Scotch landscape painter, was born in Glasgow in 1805. An early friendship with Sir Daniel Macnee, and William Leitch, the water-colourist, was the means of turning the lad’s attention to art, which he studied for a year under John Knox, a Glasgow landscapist of some repute, with whom Macnee was apprenticed at the time. After leaving the studio of Knox, we find him engaged at Cumnock, painting the ornamental lids of snuff-boxes in the manufactory of the Messrs Smith, and afterwards he was employed in Edinburgh by Lizars, the engraver, to colour the illustrations in Selby’s British Birds and similar works. Meanwhile he was diligently prosecuting his studies in higher walks of art, and working unweariedly from nature, greatly influenced in his early practice by the watercolours of H. W. Williams,—“Grecian Williams” as he was called,—whose works had a charm for the young painter after the drier and more elaborate method of his first master. Returning to Glasgow in some four or five years, he was employed by Mr Lumsden, the lord provost, on several large pictures for the decoration of a public hall which he had erected in St George’s Place, and be did a little as a theatrical scene-painter in Kilmarnock and other provincial towns. About this time he was greatly impressed with a picture by Thomson of Duddingston, and upon the works of this artist, the greatest Scottish landscapist that had yet appeared, the art of Macculloch may be said to have been founded. Gradually he asserted his individuality, and formed his own style on a closer study of nature than had been possible to his predecessor, and his works form an interesting link of connexion between the old world of Scottish landscape and the new. By its love of elaborate and balanced compositions, by its choice «of noble and exceptional scenes, his art connects itself with that of sixty years ago; by its brilliant and varied colouring, by its care for detail, it differentiates itself from the quietude and the stately abstraction of the older landscape. In 1829 Macculloch first figured in the Royal Scottish Academy’s exhibition, with a View of the Clyde, and, year by year, till his death on the 24th of June 1867, he was a liberal contributor to its displays. In 1838 he was elected a member of the Scottish Academy, Und came to reside in Edinburgh, where his genial manners gathered round him a large and appreciative circle of the artists and litterateurs of the city.

Among the more important of the long series of landscapes which he produced, subjects almost exclusively from Scottish scenery, may be mentioned—Moonlight Deer Startled, 1840; Moor Scene, Sunset, 1841; A Dream of the Highlands, 1844; Inversnaid Ferry, Loch Lomond, 1847; A Highland Deer Forest, 1856.; Ben Venue from Silver Strand, 1862; and Bothwell Castle, 1863. Several works by Macculloch were engraved by William Miller and William Forrest, and a volume of photographs from hi? landscapes, with an excellent biographical notice of the artist by Alexander Fraser, B.S.A., was published in Edinburgh in 1872.
