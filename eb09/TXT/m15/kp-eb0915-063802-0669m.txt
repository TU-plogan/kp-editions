MAURICE (1521-1553), duke and elector of Saxony, the son of Duke Henry the Pious, was born on the 21st of March 1521. He received a learned education, and at an early age gave evidence of an energetic and ambitious temper. In 1541 he married Agnes, daughter of the landgrave Philip of Hesse, and succeeded his father as duke of Saxony, of the Albertine line. Although a Protestant, he held cautiously aloof from the League of Smalkald; and in 1542 and 1543 he received imperial favour by supporting Charles V. against the Turks and the French. In 1546, when Charles V. attacked the League of Smalkald, Maurice sided with the emperor, the result being that he was made elector of Saxony in place of his cousin John Frederick (of the Ernestine line), who was taken prisoner and deposed. At this time Maurice was detested by the German Protestants, who considered him a traitor to his religion; but the tide soon turned. Fearing that the emperor’s ultimate aim was to strike at the authority of the princes, he began silently to make preparations for war; and Charles V. was imprudent enough to provide him with a pretext for opposition by detaining the landgrave Philip of Hesse, whose freedom Maurice had guaranteed. In 1551 Maurice concluded a secret treaty with Henry II. of France against the emperor, and an alliance was also formed with several German princes. Charles V. refused to believe in the reality of the danger; butin March 1552 he was startled by the intelligence that Henry II. had entered Germany as an invader, and that Maurice was hastening southward at the head of a powerful army. John Frederick and Philip were at once released, and the emperor, after an ignominious flight, was compelled to sign the treaty of Passau. After the re-establishment of peace Maurice fought for some time against the Turks in Hungary; he then returned to Saxony, and associated himself with the alliance against Margrave Albert of Brandenburg, by whom the treaty of Passau had not been recognized. At Sievershausen, on the 9th of July 1553, the margrave was defeated; but during the battle Maurice was wounded, and two days afterwards he died in his tent. He was not only a great diplomatist and general, but one of the most enlightened rulers of his age, and his early death was sincerely deplored by his subjects. In his last years he was content “with small diet and little sleep.” “Therefore,” says Roger Ascham, who had seen him, “he had a waking and working head, and became so witty and secret, so hardy and ware, so skilful of ways, both to do harm to others and to keep hurt from himself, as he never took enterprise in hand wherein he put not his adversary always to the worse.”
