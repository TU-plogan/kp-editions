MURET, or Muretus, Marc Antoine (1526-1585), French humanist, was born of respectable parentage at Muret near Limoges on 12th April 1526. Nothing is recorded of his early education, but at the age of eighteen he was already sufficiently accomplished to attract the notice of the elder Scaliger, and to be invited to prelect upon Cicero and Terence in the archiépiscopal college at Auch. He afterwards taught Latin at Villeneuve, and then at Bordeaux, where the youthful Montaigne was one of his pupils and played some of the principal parts in his Latin tragedies. Some time before 1552 he received a regency in the college of Cardinal Lemoine at Paris, and his brilliant lectures were largely attended, Henry II. and his queen being occasionally, it is recorded, among his hearers. His success seems to have excited more than the usual amount of envy; and in consequence of a disgraceful charge—which, however, was never established— he was thrown into prison. Here he had begun to carry out a resolution to starve himself to death, when the exertions of powerful friends procured his release. Hardly had he resumed lecturing at Toulouse when his career was again cut short by a new charge similar to that which had proved so disastrous at Paris; he saved his life by timely flight, but the records of the town bear that he was burned in effigy as a Huguenot and as shamefully immoral (1554). After a wandering and insecure life of some years in Italy, he received and accepted the invitation of the Cardinal d’Este to settle in Rome in 1559. Henceforward his life was one of unclouded prosperity. He was even able to revisit France in 1561 as a member of the cardinal’s suite at the colloquy of Poissy. The interest shown in his lectures on the Ethics of Aristotle, and on the Pandects, almost recalled his early successes in Paris, and in 1578 his services as a teacher of jurisprudence were sought by the “natio Germanorum” studying law at Padua, and also by the king of Poland for his new college at Cracow. Muretus, however, who about 1576 had taken holy orders, was induced by the liberality of the pope to remain in Rome, where he died on 4th June 1585.

The first collected edition of the works of Muretus appeared at Verona in 1727-1730 (5 vols. 8vo); a more complete edition was published by Ruhnken at Leyden in 1789 (4 vols. 8vo); there is also an edition by Frotscher and Koch (3 vols., Leipsic, 1834-41), and two volumes of Scripta selecta have been edited by Frey (Leipsic, 1871 - 73). He annotated wholly or partially, in a learned and scholarly way that has proved more or less serviceable to subsequent editors, Terence, Horace, Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, Tacitus, Sallust, Cicero, Aristotle, Xenophon. His other works include Juvenilia et poemata varia, Orationes, and Epistolae. His merits as a stylist at one time secured for his Orationes a place among Latin school-books, but, although, according to his pupil Montaigne, he was recognized alike by France and Italy to be “the best orator of his time,” the modern judgment must rather be in substance that of a later critic, that, if he “appears to have had a more delicate ear than almost any of the moderns and his Latinity surpasses in elegance that of any of the Romans themselves, excepting Cicero and Caesar,” he at the same time was “conceited, fantastical, and weakly-minded” (Landor, Im. Conv., “Chesterfield and Chatham”).
