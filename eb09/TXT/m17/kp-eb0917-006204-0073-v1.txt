MURRAY, John, M.D. (1778-1820), lecturer on chemistry and materia medica, w*as born in Edinburgh in 1778 and died in 1820. He was a clear and popular lecturer, and his books well represent the chemistry of the time, but he will be chiefly remembered on account of his opposition to Davy’s theory of chlorine. In support of the old view that chlorine is a compound of oxygen and anhydrous muriatic acid, he attempted to prove experimentally that muriatic acid gas contains combined water, and that chlorine contains oxygen. Dr John Davy conclusively proved that Murray’s experiments were inaccurate, and that all the phenomena can be perfectly well explained without assuming the existence of the unknown [9:17:63] anhydrous muriatic acid or the compound nature of the apparently elementary chlorine. It is interesting to note that it was in the course of the experiments made with the view of disproving Murray’s conclusions that Davy discovered phosgen, the compound of carbonic oxide and chlorine.

Murray wrote Elements of Chemistry, 2 vols. 8vo, Edinburgh, 1801 (fourth edition, 1816); Elements of Materia Medica and Pharmacy, 2 vols. 8vo, 1804 (new edition, 1810); A System of Chemistry, 4 vols. 8vo, 1806 (fourth edition, 1818); and numerous papers in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and Nicholson’s Journal.
