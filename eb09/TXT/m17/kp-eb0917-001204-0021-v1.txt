MUGGLETON, Lodowick (1610-1698), the founder of the sect of the Muggletonians, was born in Bishopsgate Street, London, about the year 1610. His father was a farrier, but he himself was bred to be a tailor. In 1651 he began to have revelations by “a motional voice,” and to proclaim himself and a brother tailor, John Reeve, as the two witnesses mentioned in the Apocalypse, and as the “true prophets of the only high, immortal, glorious God, Jesus Christ.” An exposition of their doctrines was published in 1656 under the title of The Divine Looking-Glass. Among other views (besides the doctrine of the divine mission of the authors) this work taught that the distinction of the three persons in the Trinity is merely nominal, that God has a real human body, and that He left Elijah as His vicegerent in heaven when He Himself descended to die on the cross. These opinions, strange to say, gained considerable currency, and naturally also called forth much opposition. William Penn’s book, The New Witnesses proved Old Heretics (1672), was directed against them, and in 1676 Muggleton was tried at the Old Bailey and convicted of blasphemy. Reeve died in 1658, but Muggleton survived till 1698. His collected works, including the posthumous Acts of the Witnesses, were published in 1756; and in 1832 some sixty Muggletonians subscribed to bring out a new edition of The Works of J. Reeve and I.. Muggleton (in 3 vols. 4to). Even as late as 1846 The Divine Looking-Glass was reprinted by members of the sect, which is now, however, believed to be extinct.
