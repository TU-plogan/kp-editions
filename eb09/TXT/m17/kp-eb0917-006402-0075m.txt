MUS, the name of a family of the plebeian gens of the Decii. Two members of the family, a father and a son, crowned distinguished careers in the service of Rome by a singular act of self-devotion. The father, Publius Decius Mus, won his first laurels in the Samnite war, when in 343 B.c., while serving as tribune of the soldiers, he rescued the Roman main army from an apparently hopeless position. In 340 b.c. he was consul, and had, with his colleague Manlius Torquatus, the command in the Latin war. A decisive battle took place under Mt. Vesuvius; the Romans wavered, and Decius, repeating after the chief pontiff a solemn formula by which he devoted “the legions and auxiliaries of the enemy along with himself to the Dii Manes and the earth-goddess,” dashed into the r&nks of the Latins and met a death which was followed by a crushing defeat of the enemy (Livy, viii. 9).

The son, who was also called Publius, was consul for the fourth time in 295 b.c., and devoted himself after the pattern of his father in the battle of Sentinum, when the left wing which he commanded was shaken by the Gauls (Livy, X. 28). The story of the elder Decius is regarded by Mommsen as an unhistorical “doublette” of what is related on better authority of the son.
