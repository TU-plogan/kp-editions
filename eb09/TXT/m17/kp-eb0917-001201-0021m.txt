MOZLEY, James Bowling (1813-1878), English theologian, a native of Lincolnshire, born in 1813, was educated at Oriel College, Oxford, where he graduated in 1834. He was appointed to a fellowship at Magdalen College in 1837, was ordained deacon in 1838, priest in 1844, and became vicar of Shoreham in 1856. In 1869 he became canon of Worcester, and in 1871 regius professor of divinity at Oxford. He died at Shoreham on 4th January 1878.

He wrote A Treatise on the Augustinian Doctrine of Predestination (1855); The Primitive Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration (1856); A Review of the Baptismal Controversy (1863); Subscription to the Articles: a Letter (1863); Lectures on Miracles, being the Bampton Lectures for 1865; University Sermons, 1876; and a volume on the Old Testament entitled Ruling Ideas in Early Ages (1877). In all these works he has advocated his views, those of a strongly-convinced English High-Churchman, with uprightness, learning, acuteness, and sagacity.
