MOTLEY, John Lothrop (1814-1877), the well-known historian of the Dutch Republic, was born on 15th April 1814 at Dorchester, now a part of Boston, Massachusetts, and from 1827 was educated at Harvard, where he graduated in 1831. He then studied for two years at Göttingen and Berlin, and after a period of European travel, chiefly in Italy, returned to America in 1834, where he became a student of law, and ultimately was called to the bar. In 1837 he married, and two years afterwards he published anonymously his earliest literary work, a two-volume novel, entitled Morton’s Hope, or the Memoirs of a Young Provincial, which attained, and indeed deserved, only a moderate success. In 1841 he received his first diplomatic appointment, being made secretary of legation to the Russian mission, but, finding the atmosphere of St Petersburg uncongenial, he resigned his post within a few months and definitely resolved on a literary career. Besides contributing various historical and critical essays to the North American Review, he published in 1849, again anonymously, a second novel entitled Merry Mount, a Romance of the Massachusetts Colony. About the year 1846 the project of writing a history of Holland had begun to take shape in his mind, and he had already prepared a considerable quantity of MS., when, finding the materials at his disposal in the United States quite inadequate for the completion of his work, he resolved to migrate to Europe along with his family in 1851. The next five years were spent at Berlin, Dresden, Brussels, and the Hague in laborious investigation of the archives preserved in those capitals, and resulted in 1856 in the publication of The Rise of [9:17:3] the, Dutch Republic, a History (London and New York, 3 vols. 8vo). This work, which, after a large historical introduction, minutely follows the history of the Low Countries from the abdication of Charles in 1555 down to the assassination of William the Silent in 1584, immediately became highly popular by its graphic manner and the warm and sympathetic spirit in which it was written, while at the same time it was frankly recognized by scholars as a painstaking and conscientious piece of original work. It speedily passed through many English editions, was translated into French (with an introduction by Guizot) in 1859, and also into Dutch (with introduction and notes by Bakhuizen van den Brink, himself a distinguished historian), as well as into German and Russian. Pursuing his researches in England, France, Belgium, and Holland, Motley was able to publish in 1860 the first two volumes of the History of the United Netherlands, covering the period from the death of William the Silent in 1584 to shortly after the destruction of the Armada, by which the Spanish project for subjugating England and reconquering the Netherlands was finally defeated. This work, which was on a somewhat larger scale than the preceding, embodied the results of a still greater amount of original research, not only in the Dutch archives, in the copies of the Simancas archives, and in the portions of those archives still retained in Paris, but also in the London State Paper Office, and in the MS. department of the British Museum. By two new volumes published in 1868 the work was brought down to the twelve years’ truce in 1609, and it was announced that the author was engaged in writing a continuation which should embrace the history of the Thirty Years’ War. Meanwhile Motley from the close of 1861 to 1867 had held the post of United States minister at Vienna; in 1869 he was appointed to a similar position at the court of St James’s, but was recalled in 1870. After a short visit to Holland he again took up his residence in England, where The Life and Death of John Barneveld, Advocate of Holland, with a view of the primary Causes of the Thirty Years' War (2 vols.) appeared in 1874. Ill health now began to interfere with sustained literary work, and, after a protracted period of failing vigour, he died at Kingston Russell House, near Dorchester, Dorsetshire, on 29th May 1877.

Motley was member of a number of learned societies in Europe and America, and held a variety of honorary degrees. Among minor works not noticed above may be mentioned a pamphlet on the Causes of the Civil War in America (1861), which originally appeared in the correspondence columns of the Times newspaper, and Democracy, a Historical Essay (1869), originally delivered as an address to the New York Historical Society. The merits of Motley as an historian are undeniably great; he has told the story of a stirring period in the history of the world with full attention to the character of the actors and strict fidelity to the numerous vivid details of the action. But it may safely be said that his tale is best where most unvarnished, and probably no writer of the same rank has owed less to the mere sparkle of highly polished literary style.
