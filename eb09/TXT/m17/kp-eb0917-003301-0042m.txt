MUNZINGER, Werner (1832-1875), African traveller and linguist, was born at Olten in Switzerland, 4th. April 1832. After studying at Bern, Munich, and Paris, he went to Egypt in 1852 and spent a year in Cairo studying the language. Entering a French mercantile house, he went as leader of a trading expedition to various parts of the Red Sea, fixing his quarters at Massowah in 1854 to 1855, where he acted as French consul. In 1855 he removed to Keren, the chief town of the Bogos, in the north of Abyssinia, which country he explored in all directions during the next six years. In 1861 he joined the expedition under Heuglin to Central Africa, but separated from it in November in northern Abyssinia, proceeding along the Gash and Atbara to Khartùm, and thence in 1862 to Kordofân, failing, however, in his attempt to reach Darfur and Wadai, having meantime succeeded Heuglin as leader of the German African expedition. After a short stay in Europe in 1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east borderlands of Abyssinia, and in 1865 was appointed British consul at Massowah, rendering valuable aid to the English Abyssinian expedition in 1867, among other things exploring the almost unknown Afar country. In acknowledgment of his services he received the honour of C.B. In 1868 he was appointed French consul, and in 1871 by the khedive governor of Massowah with·the title of “bey.” In 1870, with Captain Miles, Munzinger visited the interior of southern Arabia. As governor of Massowah he annexed to Egypt a part of northern Abyssinia, and in 1872 was made pasha and governorgeneral of the eastern Sudan. In an expedition from Tajurra Bay to the kingdom of Shoa, Munzinger was killed, along with his wife and many of his companions, in an attack by a body of Gallas on 14th November 1875, in the neighbourhood of Lake Assal.

Munzinger’s contributions to our knowledge of the country, people, and languages of north-eastern Africa are of solid value. See Proc. R. G. S., vol. xiii.; JI. R. G.
