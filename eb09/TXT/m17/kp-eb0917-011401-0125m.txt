MUZAFFARNAGAR or Mozuffernugger, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces, India, lying between 29° 11' and 29° 45' N. lat. and 77° 3' and 78° 10' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Sahâranpur, on the E. by the Ganges, on the S. by Meerut, and on the W. by the Jumna, with an area of 1656 square miles. It lies near the northern extremity of the Doâb or great alluvial plain between the Ganges and the Jumna, and shares to a large extent in the general monotony of that level region. A great portion of the area is sandy and unfertile, but under irrigation the soil is rapidly improving, and in many places the villages have succeeded in introducing a high state of cultivation.

The census of 1881 returned the population at 758,444 (males 409,436, females 349,008). The excessive proportion of males is doubtless due to the practice of female infanticide, which Government has done all in its power to suppress. In 1874 no less than ninety-four villages were still on the “proclaimed” list under the Infanticide Act. Hindus numbered 535,218, Mohammedans 213,842, Christians 54, and Buddhists 9330. The population of the four municipal towns in 1881 was as follows—Muzaffarnagar (the chief town and administrative headquarters), 15,080; Kairana, 18,374; Kândhla, 11,109; Shamli, 7359. Out of a total area of 1,059,910 acres in 1881-82, 707,394 were returned as under cultivation. In the rcΛΛ harvest the chief crops are wheat, barley, millet, and pulse. The kharif or autumn crops include the above grains, together with sugar-cane, cotton, and indigo. Irrigation was afforded in 1881-82 by one or other of the great canals to 219,121 acres. The condition of the peasantry is comfortable, and the village communities are prosperous and intelligent. Most of the land is cultivated by husbandmen with rights of occupancy; the number of tenants-at-will is rapidly declining. Rents are more frequently paid in kind than in cash. Before the opening of the canals Muzaffarnagar was liable to famines caused by drought; but the danger from this has been minimized by the spread of irrigation. Its trade is confined to the raw materials it produces. The climate of the district is comparatively cool owing to its proximity to the hills; and the average rainfall is about 29 inches.

Hindu tradition represents Muzaffarnagar as having formed a portion of the Pandâva kingdom of the Mahâbhàrata ; authentic history, however, dates from the time of the Moslem conquests in the 13 th century, from which time it remained a dependency of the various Mohammedan dynasties which ruled at Delhi until the practical downfall of the Mughal empire in the middle of the last century. In 1788 the district fell into the hands of the Mahrattas. After the fall of Aligarh, the whole Doab as far north as the Siwâlik hills passed into the hands of the British without a blow, and Muzaffarnagar became part of Sahâranpur. It was created a separate jurisdiction in 1824.

Muzaffarnagar, chief town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated on the military road from Meerut to Landaur in 29° 28' N. lat. and 77° 44' E. long. The population in 1881 was 15,080, of whom 8814 were males and 6266 females. It is a closely-built town, crowded with small lanes, and was founded in 1633. It is now a station on the Sind, Punjâb, and Delhi Railway, and has a considerable trade in agricultural produce.
