MURREE, or Marri, a sanatorium and hill station in the Râwal Pindi district, Punjab, is situated in 33° 54' N. lat. and 73° 26' E. long. It forms the great northern sanatorium for the Punjab, and is the ordinary summer resort of the local Government. The houses crown the summit and sides of an irregular ridge of the Murree hills, 7507 feet above sea-level, and command a magnificent view. The climate is admirably adapted to the constitution of Europeans; the lowest recorded temperature is 21° Fahr., the highest 96°. The resident population in 1868 was 2346; but in the height of the season it probably amounts to 12,000 or 14,000, numbers of visitors being attracted from Lahore, Râwal Pindi, Peshawar, and the plains generally.
