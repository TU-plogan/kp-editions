MOZDOK, a Russian town in the government of the Caucasus and province of Stavropol, lies on the left bank of the Terek, 465 feet above the level of the sea, in 43’ 4Γ N. lat. and 44° 39' E. long., 58 miles north of Vladikavkas[9:17:12], with which it is connected by a highroad, and 36 ⅜ miles east of the Prochladnaya station on the Rostoff-Vladikavkas railway. Built on the site of an oak-wood (moz, noz, thick or dark, dok, wood, in Kabardine) in 1763 by Kogorko-Kontchukin, prince of Kabarda, it soon became an important point in the Russian line towards the Caucasus, and was fortified with earthen rampart and ditch. In 1840 it was attacked by Schamyl and 5000 mountaineers. The population (8760 in 1863) numbered 11,008 in 1877, 52 per cent, being “Orthodox” (with very few sectaries), 29 per cent. Armenians, 15 per cent. Mohammedans, and 2 per cent. Catholics. Gardening and agriculture are the main means of subsistence, scarcely fifty individuals living by trade. The melons and water-melons of Mozdok are widely famed; and, though vine-growing was only begun in 1873, by 1876 there was a production of 563 casks of wine or 1,416,000 bottles. An oil-mill, tanneries, and soapworks are among the industrial establishments. Three fairs are held in the year.
