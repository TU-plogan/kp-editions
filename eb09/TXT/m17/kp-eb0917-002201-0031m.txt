MUMPS (syn. Cynanche parotidaea, parotitis, also “The Branks”), a contagious disease characterized by inflammatory swelling of the parotid and other salivary glands, frequently occurring as an epidemic, and affecting mostly young persons. The disease generally sets in with symptoms of a cold or catarrh accompanied with slight febrile disturbance, but soon the nature of the ailment is announced by the occurrence of swelling and stiffening in the region of the parotid gland in front of the ear. The swelling speedily increases in size and spreads downwards towards the neck and under the jaw, involving the numerous glands in that locality. The effect is to produce much disfigurement, which becomes still greater should the inflammation spread, as often happens, to the glands on the other side of the face and neck. Pain is present in the swollen parts, but it is seldom very severe, nor is there much redness or any tendency to suppuration. There is, however, considerable interference with the acts of mastication and swallowing. After continuing for four or five days the swelling and other symptoms abate, and the parts are soon restored to their normal condition. During the period of convalescence there occasionally occur some swelling and [9:17:23] tenderness in other glands, such as the testicles in males, and the mammae or ovaries in females, but these are of short duration and of no serious significance. That this complaint is highly contagious is shown by the readiness with which it spreads among children in schools, &c. The nature of the infecting agent is unknown, but the medium of communication is most probably the breath or secretions of the mouth. Mumps is in general a mild disease, and requires but little treatment beyond a gentle laxative, the application of warm fomentations to the swollen and painful parts, and the use of soft food.
