MOUSE-BIRD (Dutch MuisvogeΓ), the name by which in Cape Colony and Natal the members of the genus Colius ^[1. Some other generic divisions have been suggested, but on grounds so slender as hardly to merit consideration.] of Brisson are known—partly, it would seem, from their general coloration, but more probably from their singular habit of creeping along the boughs of trees with the whole tarsus applied to the branch. By the earlier systematists, who had few opportunities of examining the internal structure of exotic forms, Colius was placed among the Fringillidae ; but nearly all travellers who had seen one or another species of it in life demurred to that view. Still its position was doubtful till Dr Murie, in an elaborate treatise on its osteology {Ibis, 1872, pp. 262-280), showed that it was no Passerine, and subsequently {Ibis, 1873, p. 190) proposed Pamprodactylae as the name of the group of which the Family Coliidae is the sole type—this word being coined to indicate the obvious character of all the toes being ordinarily directed forwards, but by no means the only peculiar character these birds possess. A few years later most of Dr Murie’s views were confirmed [9:17:7] by Garrod {Proc. Zool. Society, 1876, pp. 416-419), who added considerably to our knowledge of the general anatomy of the Family, which he considered to be related on the one hand to the Piddae, and on the other to the Alcedinidae (see Kingfisher, vol. xiv. p. 81) and Bucerotidae (see Hornbill. vol. xii. P. 169). The Coliidae are small birds, with a rather Finch-like bill, a more or less crested head, a very long tail, and generally of a dun or slate-coloured plumage that sometimes brightens into blue or is pleasingly diversified with white or chestnut. They feed almost wholly on fruits, but occasionally take insects, in quest of which they pass in bands of fifteen or twenty from tree to tree, and hang in all attitudes from the branches as they feed. It is even said that they sleep suspended by their powerful and versatile toes. Seven species are believed to exist, all belonging to the Ethiopian Region (of which the Family is one of the most characteristic), and ranging from Abyssinia southwards. Three species inhabit Cape Colony, (a. n.)
