MURRAY, Sir Robert (c. 1600-1673), one of the founders of the Royal Society, was the son of Sir Robert Murray of Craigie, Ayrshire, and was born about the beginning of the 17 th century. In early life he served for some years in the French army, and, winning the favour of Richelieu, he rose to the rank of colonel. On the outbreak of the civil war he returned to Scotland and was energetic in collecting recruits for the royal cause. The triumph of Cromwell compelled him for a time to return to France, but he took an active part in the Scottish insurrection in favour of Charles II. in 1650, and was named lord justice clerk and a privy councillor. These appointments, which on account of the overthrow of the royal cause proved to be at the time only nominal, were confirmed at the Restoration in 1660. Soon after this event Sir Robert Murray began to take a prominent part in the deliberations of a club instituted in London for the discussion of natural science, or, as it was then called, the “new philosophy.” When it was proposed to obtain a charter for the society he undertook to interest the king in the matter, the result being that on 15th July 1662 the club was incorporated by charter under the designation of the Royal Society. Sir Robert Murray was its first president, and during the remainder of his life exerted himself with great zeal and ability to extend its influence. He died in June 1673.
