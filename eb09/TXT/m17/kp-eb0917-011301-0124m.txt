MUTINY. This word, which primarily means a commotion and then an insurrection or sedition, is in English military law applied to a sedition in any forces belonging to Her Majestyâ€™s regular, reserve, or auxiliary forces, or navy. Such offences are dealt with by courts-martial, which up to the year 1879 derived their authority from the annual Mutiny Act (Act for punishing Mutiny and Desertion and for the better payment of the Army and their Quarters), the maintenance of a standing army in time of peace being illegal without the consent of parliament. For further details see Military Law and Court Martial.
