MOTRIL, a town of Spain in the province of Granada, is charmingly situated at the foot of an offshoot of the Sierra Nevada, on the edge of a rich alluvial plain about a mile from the Mediterranean and 40 miles south-southeast from Granada, with which it is connected by a good carriage road. The town has no buildings of special architectural or historical interest. The climate is semi-tropical, and the “vega” or plain of Motril has been found peculiarly adapted for the culture of the sugar-cane, of which the annual average yield has recently been estimated at 113,636 tons. In the district there are five sugar-factories, —two in the immediate vicinity of the town, and three at Salobrena, a village about 3 miles to the westward at the mouth of the Rio Grande (Guadalfeo). Some cotton is also grown and manufactured. This neighbourhood is rich in lead, chiefly wrought by companies having very limited capital; the ore is for the most part smelted on the spot and afterwards sent to Malaga, or direct to England. Zinc and copper are also found, but in smaller quantities. Esparto grass is exported. The population of Motril in 1878 was 16,665. The harbour (El Puerto de Motril) lies about 6⅛ miles to the south-eastward at the village of Calahonda.
