MOULINS, chief town of the French department of Allier, is situated 195 miles by rail south-south-east from Paris on the right bank of the Allier, which is here crossed by a remarkable bridge about 1000 feet in length, consisting of thirteen semicircular arches. The town, which stands at an altitude of about 740 feet above sealevel, is adorned with gardens and fine boulevards, and still contains several buildings of historical interest and many houses of the Middle Ages. The cathedral has a very beautiful choir, with richly-painted windows of the 15th and 16th centuries. The nave, in the Pointed style, is of recent construction, as are the two towers with stone spires rising to the height of 312 feet. The white stone chiefly employed is happily contrasted with ornamental columns of black basalt. The chapel of the lyceum, which occupies the site of an ancient convent of the Visitation, contains a richly-carved mausoleum to the memory of Duke Henry of Montmorency, who was beheaded in the reign of Louis XIII. Among other objects of interest in Moulins are some remains of the old chateau of the dukes of Bourbon, and the clock tower. The library of nearly 25,000 volumes contains a manuscript Bible of the 12th century which was used at the council of Constance in 1415. There are no industries of importance, except the manufacture of wire ropes for mines, and of sulphate of barium. The population in 1881 was 21,126.

The history of Moulins does not go farther back than the 10th century, and its importance dates from the 14 th, when it became the residence of the dukes of Bourbon. After the constable de Bourbon’s desertion to Charles V. the town, along with Bourbonnais, fell into the hands of the king of France. In 1566 an assembly of the states-general was held in the town by Charles IX. and Catherine de Medici. Moulins has suffered frequently from epidemics and inundations, and the ducal palace was destroyed by fire in 1755.
