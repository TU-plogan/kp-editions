MUSSCHENBROEK, Pieter van(1692-1761), natural philosopher, was born at Leyden in March 1692, and studied at the university of his native city. The teacher from whom he derived the most profit was the eminent mathematician Gravesande. A scientific partnership was formed in 1717 between the master and the pupil for the prosecution of natural philosophy according to the principles of Newton, and in opposition to those of Descartes; Gravesande concentrating his attention on the theoretical part of the study, while Musschenbroek conducted the experiments. The consequence was that the downfall of Cartesianism and the establishment of Newtonianism were very much accelerated in Holland. Graduating in 1715 with a dissertation, De aeris praesentia in humoribus animalium, Musschenbroek was appointed professor at Duisburg in 1719. In 1723 he was promoted to the chair of natural philosophy and mathematics at Utrecht. In 1731 he dechned an invitation to Copenhagen, and was promoted in consequence to the chair of astronomy at Utrecht in 1732. The attempt of George II. of England in 1737 to attract him to the newly-established university of Göttingen was also unsuccessful. At length, however, the claims of his native city overcame his resolution to remain at Utrecht, and he took possession of the mathematical chair at Leyden in 1739, where, declining all offers from abroad, he continued till his death in September 1761.

His first important production was Epitome elementorum physico-mathcmaticorum, 12mo, Leyden, 1726,—a work which was afterwards gradually altered as it passed through several editions, and which appeared at length (posthumously, edited by Ludolf) in 1762, under the title of Introductio ad philosophiam naturalem. The Physicae experimentales et geometricae dissertationes (1729) threw new light on magnetism, capillary attraction, and the cohesion of bodies. A Latin edition with notes (1731) of the Italian work Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nelΓ Accademia del Cimcnto contained amid many other curious investigations a description of a [9:17:110] new instrument, the pyrometer, which Musschenbroek had invented, and of several experiments which he had made on the expansion of bodies by heat. Musschenbroek is also the author of Elementa physica, 8vo, 1734 (English translation 1744 by Colson), and of papers in the Mémoires of the Paris and St Petersburg Academies, and in the London Philosophical Transactions.
