MYDDLETON, Sir Hugh (c. 1555-1631), the projector of the New River scheme for supplying London with water, was the sixth son of Richard Myddleton, governor of Denbigh Castle in the reigns of Edward VI., Mary, and Elizabeth. Hugh Myddleton became a goldsmith in London, occupying a shop in Bassihaw (now Basinghall) Street, and he is also mentioned in the records of Denbigh, for which he was chosen M.P. in 1603, as a merchant adventurer. In the state papers there is an entry of Â£250 paid to him for a jewel supplied to the queen. In connexion with his business as goldsmith Myddleton worked silver and lead mines in Cardiganshire, and in this way obtained the practical knowledge of engineering which enabled him to put in operation his scheme for supplying London with water (see London, vol. xiv. p. 825). In recognition of his services he was created a baronet by James I. in 1622; but pecuniarily the enterprise was a complete failure. Myddleton died 10th December 1631, and was buried in the churchyard of St Matthew, Friday Street, London. See Pinks, History of Clerkenwell.
