MUZAFFARGARH, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, India, lying between 29° Γ and 30° 46' N. lat. and 70° 33' and 71° 49' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Derâ Ismâil Khân and Jhang districts, on the E. and S.E. by the Chenâb river, and on the W. by the Indus, with an area of 3136 square miles. It occupies the extreme southern apex of the Sind Sâgar Doâb, the wedge-shaped tract between the Indus and the Five Rivers or Panjnad. The district stretches northward from their confluence in a narrow ridge of land, gradually widening for about 120 miles, until at its northern border it is 55 miles broad. In the northern half of the district is the wild thal or central desert of the Sind Sâgar Doâb, an arid elevated tract with a width of 40 miles in the extreme north, which gradually contracts until it disappears about 10 miles south of Muzaffargarh town. Although apparently a tableland, it is really composed of separate sandhills, with intermediate valleys lying at a lower level than that of the Indus, and at times flooded. Scattered amid this waste of sand-heaps are a few good plots of land, which the industry of the Jât cultivators has appropriated. The border strips fringing the thal towards the rivers are also for the most part under cultivation. South of the thal, the country consists of rich and productive lands, out of the reach of excessive flooding and at the same time within [9:17:114] reach of easy irrigation. But in the extreme south the floods from the two rivers spread at times over the whole intervening tract. On abating they leave luxuriant pasturage; and, if the subsidence takes place sufficiently early, magnificent crops of wheat, pease, and other grain are raised in the cultivated portion. The towns stand on high sites or are protected by embankments; but the villages scattered over the lowlands are exposed to annual inundations, during which the people abandon their grass-built huts and take refuge on wooden platforms attached to each house. Throughout the cold weather large herds of camels, belonging chiefly to the Povindah merchants of Afghânistân, graze upon the sandy waste.

The census of 1881 returned the population at 338,605 (males, 184,510, females 154,095), viz., 292,476 Mohammedans, 43,297 Hindus, 2788 Sikhs, 33 Christians, and 44 “others.” The district contains only one town with a population exceeding 5000—namely, Kot Adu or Parhar (5552). Muzaffargarh, the headquarters station, has only 3136 inhabitants. The area under cultivation in 1881 was returned at 397,529 acres, of which 279,103 were irrigated by government works, and 118,376 by private individuals. The areas under the different crops in 1881-82 were rice 38,589 acres, wheat 193,749, great millet 15,915, spiked millet 15,431, barley 11,450, pease 32,388, gram 7959, masûr 6382, and tobacco 655. Most of the land is cultivated by the proprietors themselves; and the rents, where they exist, are almost universally paid in kind. Trade is mainly in the hands of Povindah merchants. The district is unusually hot and dry, the average rainfall for the seven years ending 1872-73 being only 5 , 9 inches.

Muzaffargarh possesses hardly any distinct annals of its own, having always formed part of Multän {q∙v.).
