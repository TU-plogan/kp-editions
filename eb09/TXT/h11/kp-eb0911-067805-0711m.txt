HEPHAeSTION, a grammarian of Alexandria, author of a work on Greek metres called ryχ∈ιpt‰v πefi piτpωv. This work is most valuable as the only complete work on the subject that has been preserved. The author is probably[9:11:679] the same as the grammarian that acted as tutor to the emperor Verus about 150 a.d.
