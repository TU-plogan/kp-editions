HEILSBERG, a town of Prussia, capital of a circle in the government district of Königsberg, is situated at the junction of the Simserand Alle, 38 miles S. of Königsberg. It has one Evangelical and two Catholic churches, and an old castle formerly the seat of the prince-bishops of Ermland, but now used as an infirmary. The principal industries are cloth-weaving, yarn and thread spinning, dyeing, and brewing, and there is considerable trade in grain. The population of the town in 1875 was 5762.

The castle founded at Heilsberg by the German knights in 1240 became afterwards the property of the bishops of Ermland, who in 1306 made it their seat—an honour which it retained for 500 years. On the 10th June 1807 a battle took place at Heilsberg between the French and the Russians under Benningsen, which, although the French who attacked thought it prudent to withdraw before victory declared for either side, resulted on the following day in the retreat of the Russians.
