HEATHCOAT, John (1783-1861), the author of important inventions for facilitating the manufacture of Buckingham or French lace, was born at Duffield near Derby in 1783. During his apprenticeship to a framesmith near Loughborough, he made an improvement in the construction of the warp-loom, so as to produce mitts of a lace-like appearance by means of it. He commenced business on his own account at Nottingham, but finding himself subjected to the intrusion of competing inventors he removed to Hathern. There he diligently prosecuted his experiments, and in 1808 constructed a machine capable of producing an exact imitation of real pillow-lace. This was by far the most expensive and complex textile apparatus till then existing; and in describing the process of his invention, Heathcoat said in 1836, “The single difficulty of getting the diagonal threads to twist in the allotted space was so great that, if now to be done, I should probably not attempt its accomplishment.” Some time before perfecting his invention, which he patented in 1809, he removed to Loughborough, where he entered into partnership with Mr Lacy, a Nottingham manufacturer; but in 1816 their factory was attacked by the Luddites and the lace frames destroyed. The damages were assessed in the King’s Bench at £10,000; but as Heathcoat declined to expend the money in the county of Leicester he never received any part of it. Undaunted by his loss, he began at once to construct new and greatly improved machines in an unoccupied factory at Tiverton, Devonshire, propelling them by water-power and afterw ards by steam. His claim to the invention of the twisting and traversing lace machine was disputed, and a patent was taken out by a clever workman for a similar machine, which was decided at a trial in 1816 to be an infringement of Heathcoat’s patent. He followed his great invention by others of much ability, as, for instance, contrivances for ornamenting net w hile. in course of manufacture and for making ribbons and platted and twisted net upon his machines, improved yarn spinning-frames, and methods for winding raw silk from cocoons. He also patented an improved process for extracting and purifying salt. An offer of £10,000 was made to him in 1833 for the use of his processes in dressing and finishing silk nets, but he allowed the highly profitable secret to remain undivulged. In 1832 he patented a steam plough, which stood foremost in public estimation until superseded by those of Fowler and others. Heathcoat was elected member of parliament for Tiverton in 1832. Though he seldom spoke in the House he was constantly engaged on committees, where his thorough know ledge of business and sound judgment were highly valued. He retained his seat until 1859, and after two years of declining health he died in January 1861 at Bolham House, near Tiverton.
