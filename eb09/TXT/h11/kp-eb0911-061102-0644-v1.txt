HEEMSKERK, Johan van (1597-1656), Dutch poet, was born at Amsterdam in 1597. He was educated as a child at Bayonne, and entered the university of Leyden in 1617. In 1621 he we<ιt abroad on the grand tour, leaving behind him his first volume of poems, Minnekunst (The Art of Love), which appeared in 1622. He was absent from Holland four years. He was made master of arts at Bourges in 1623, and in 1624 visited Hugo Grotius in Paris. On his return in 1625 he published Minηepligt (The Duty of Love), and began to practise as an advocate in the Hague. In 1628 he was sent to England in his legal capacity by the Dutch East India Company, to settle the dispute respecting Amboyna. In the same year he published the poem entitled Minnekunde, or the Science of Love. He proceeded to Amsterdam in 1640, where he married Alida, sister of the eminent statesman Van Beuningen. In 1642 he published The Cid, a tragicomedy, and in 1647 his most famous work, the pastoral romance of Batavische Arcadia, which he had written ten years before. During the last twelve years of his life Heemskerk sat in the upper chamber of the states-general. His last poetical work was The Inconstant Hylas. He died at Amsterdam on the 27th of February 1656.

The poetry of Heemskirk, which fell into oblivion during the 18th century, is now once more read and valued. He takes a prominent place among writers of the second rank in the great age of Dutch literature. But his famous pastoral, the Bαtανiαn Arcadia, which was founded on the Astréc of Honoré d’Urfé, enjoyed a great popularity for more than a century, and passed through twelve editions. It provoked a host of more or less able imitations, of which the most distinguished were the Bοοrlschc Arcadia (1662) of Lambertus Bos, the Zaanlandsche Arcadia (1658) of Hendrik Zooteboom, and the Rolterdamschc Arcadia (1703) of Willem den Eiger. But the original work of Heemskerk, in which a party of nymphs and shepherds go out from the Hague to Katwijk, and there indulge in polite and pastoral discourse, surpasses all these in brightness and versatility.
