HAM (D∏), the second son of Noah (Gen. v. 32), and the progenitor of Cush, Mizraim, Phut, and Canaan (Gen. X. 6). On the assumption that these early genealogies are geographical rather than personal or even ethnological, the name Ham, which in Hebrew radically signifies “hot,” would seem to indicate the torrid zone; and this inference, though not supported, so far as has been hitherto discovered, by any corresponding explanation of the names of Shem and Japheth, at least harmonizes well with the fact that on the whole Shem seems intended to denote the intermediate and Japheth the northern regions of the world as known to the compiler of the Book of Genesis. The attempt has sometimes been made to identify Ham with Kerne or Chemi, an old native name of Egypt, signifying “black,” and having reference, it is supposed, to the colour of the soil. But this identification has no adequate etymological support (see Lepsius in Herzog and Plitt’s Encykl., i. 166); and the allusions in several of the Psalms to Egypt as the land of Ham (Ps. cv. 23, cvi. 22) are not inconsistent with the belief that the latter name was primarily used in a much wider and less local sense. The solitary incident regarding Ham related in Gen. ix. 20-27 seems intended to indicate, from the Israelite point of view, the immodest and sensual tendencies of the Canaanites and other “Hamitic” peoples.
