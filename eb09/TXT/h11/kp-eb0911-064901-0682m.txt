HEMS, Homs, or Hums, a town of Syria, about 63 miles byroad north-east of Tripoli (Tarâbulus), situated 1312 feet, according to Cernik, above the level of the sea, on the eastern side of. the valley of the Nahr el Asy or Orontes, which about 4 miles further down forms the lake of Hems, Atini, or Kabas. The kalaat or castle, a great mound “still crowned with a tiara of torn and ruined towers,” forms a striking landmark well-known to the caravans journeying north from Damascus. It is about 120 feet in height, and has a breadth of 435 feet and a width of 375. According to Captain Burton, it probably occupies the site of the temple of the sun, which formed the glory of the ancient city: not only does it contain columnar masses of syenite, grey granite, and white marble, but he found, apparently in position, a Doric pilaster. Though the ancient walls of Hems, with a circuit of about a mile and a half, are greatly dilapidated and even in many places practically demolished, the town is entered by regular gates, six in number, which in olden times bore the names of the planets. Within it presents little except narrow and tortuous streets, poorly paved and foul, with houses for the most part of the meanest description; but none the less it is the seat of a Turkish vice-governor or mutesarif, as well as of a Greek and a Maronite bishop, and its cavalry barracks are capable of containing two regiments. As the market-town of the neighbouring tribes it has some commercial importance: it trades in cotton, sesame, and oil; and among its craftsmen it numbers a body of skilful goldsmiths and about 3000 silk weavers, whose looms produce the finest kind of kaffiehs or head-cloths. The population is estimated at from 20,000 to 40,000, and about 7000 are Christians. Jews are conspicuous by their absence, though one of the gates of the town in the quarter which they formerly occupied is still called the “Jews’ Gate.”

Hems is the Emesa, Emissa, or Hemesa of the Romans, and by Ptolemy it is assigned to the district of Apameue. Its inhabitants are mentioned among the early opponents of the Roman arms. Heliogabalus or Bassianus, declared emperor in 218 A. ι>., was a native of Emesa, and held office as a priest of the sun. It was in the neighbourhood of the town that the army of Zenobia was routed by Aurelian. The first Christian bishop is said to have been St Silvanus. About fourteen years after the Hegira Khalid bin Walid, who was to find his grave in one of its suburbs, made himself master of Hems; and from 1098 to 1187 it was in the hands of the crusaders. It was probably Saladin, by whom they were expelled, that turned the temple of the sun, which under Christian rule had been used as a cathedral, into the chief fortress of the place. In July 1831 Ibrahim Pasha, having defeated the governor of Aleppo at Hems, caused the fortress to be blown up.

The poet Ka’ab el Alιbar is buried in the town, and the people show another grave which they wrongly believe to be that of Ja’afar el Tayyar.
