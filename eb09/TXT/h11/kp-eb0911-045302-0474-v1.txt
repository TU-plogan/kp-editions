HAPSBURG, or Habsburg (originally Habichtsburg, that is, Hawkscastle), an old German family which has given sovereigns to Germany, Spain, and Austria, takes its name from the old Swiss castle of Habsburg, now in ruins, situated on the river Aar in the canton of Aargau. The first mention of the countship of Habsburg is in a document of 1099, where the name Werner, count of Habsburg, occurs in connexion with the consecration of the monastery of M ’ ari as confirming the grants of the pious foundations made by his ancestors. This Werner of Habsburg was a nephew of Werner, bishop of Strasburg, who built the castle of Habsburg about the year 1020. The succession of the family cannot be traced between this period and the time of the emperor Frederick Barbarossa, but in a document whose date is 30th May 1153, Werner II. and his son Albert the Rich are mentioned as counts of Habsburg. This Albert was by Frederick created landgrave of Upper Alsace, and received the countship of the district of Zürich and the protectorship of the monasteries of Seckingen and Murbach; and on the extinction of the house of Zähringen he also succeeded to a considerable portion of their territories. Albert died in 1199, and was succeeded by his son Rudolf the Old, who, as a reward for placing a large sum of money at the disposal of Frederick II., received from him the countship of Aargau. He held an influential position among the Swabian nobility, and so increased his possessions that they included the territories of the bishops of Strasburg, Constance, Basel, Coire, Ghent, and Lausanne, and of the abbot of St Gall, in addition to which he also obtained the countship of Frickgau. Rudolf left behind him two sons, Albert the Wise and Rudolf II., who shared the possessions between them, and founded respectively the lines of Hapsburg-Hapsburg and Hapsburg Laufenburg,—Albert, besides the castle of Hapsburg, holding the lands in Aargau and Alsace, and Rudolf the countships of Klettgau, Rheinfeld, and Laufenburg, and the possessions in Breisgau. The Laufenburg line also divided into two branches, the former of which became extinct in 1408 and the latter in 1415. Laufenburg thereupon fell to Austria, and Klettgau, through the marriage of the female heiress of the line, to the counts Sutz, from whom it passed by marriage in 1687 to the house of Schwarzenberg. Albert the Wise of Hapsburg-Hapsburg was married to the countess of Kyburg, who was descended from the dukes of Zähringen, and related to the emperor Frederick II. From this union there was born on the 1st May 1218, Rudolf, the founder of the royal dynasty of Hapsburg. He was elected king of Germany in 1273, and after the defeat and death of Ottocar, king of Bohemia, in 1278, at Marchfeld on the Danube, he annexed to his possessions Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola. On the death of Rudolf in 1291 Adolf, count of Nassau, was elected his successor to the German crown, but although on the death of Adolf it again reverted to the Hapsbuιg line in the person of Albert I., it passed on his death to Henry, count of Luxembourg, and with the exception of the doubtful period when Frederick, eldest son of Albert, and Lewis, duke of Bavaria, divided the suffrages of the electors and were crowned, the one at Bonn and the other at Aix-la-Chapelle, the Hapsburg line remained excluded from its possession till the time of Albert II., who succeeded Sigismund as king of Bohemia and Hungary in 1437, and was chosen emperor of the Romans in 1438. The greater part of the original lands of the house were gradually lost by the victories of the Eidgenossen, who finally in 1474 obtained Aargau, in which the castle of Habsburg was situated. Philip, son of Maximilian I. and of Donna Juana of Spain, ascended the Spanish throne in May 1506, and on his death in September of the same year, he was succeeded by Charles I., who was chosen emperor in 1519, and was thenceforth known as Charles V. In 1521 Charles granted his Austrian possessions to Ferdinand I., who became the head of the Austrian dynasty. The Spanish branch became extinct in 1700 with the death of King Charles II., and the male line of the Austrian branch became extinct with the death of the emperor Charles VI. in 1740; but the Austrian house was continued in the female line by Maria Theresa, who by her marriage with Francis of Lotharingia, chosen emperor in 1745, founded [9:11:454] the line of Hapsburg-Lothanngia, from which the present imperial dynasty of Austria is descended.

The main facts of the history of the house of Hapsburg, from the time of Rudolf I., king of Germany, will be found in the articles Austria (vol. iii. p. 124), Germany (vol. x. p. 496), and Spain.
