HELLENISTS(jVλλpvtστal') was the name usually applied by those who called themselves Greeks (Hellenes) to all Graecizing and more especially to all Greek-speaking foreigners,—a class which, after the conquests of Alexander the Great, formed a large and important element in almost every community throughout the civilized world. More particularly the word is applied in the New Testament (Acts vi. 1; ix. 29; and, according to the textus receptus, also xi. 20, where, however, the best MSS. and critical editions read "Eλλψms) to Greek-speaking or “Grecian” Jews, who, besides being very numerous in the various countries of the dispersion, had also many synagogues in Jerusalem, and were remarkable there for their zeal. Indeed their presence in the capital of Judaism at all may safely be taken to have implied on their part a more than ordinary interest in the affairs of the ideal theocratic kingdom; their attitude therefore to Christianity, when that new system first came to be promulgated, could not fail to be very pronounced on the one side or on the other. The early records show that the apostles made many converts among the Hellenists of the city; and it is interesting to note that, if the names can be taken as a safe indication, all the seven deacons mentioned in Acts vi. 5 belonged to the “Hellenistic” and not to the “Hebrew” party within the primitive church. Saul of Tarsus also was a Hellenist; but whether he belonged to the synagogue of the “Libertines” or to that of “those of Cilicia” is a question which our data do not enable us to decide. In the Vulgate, which translates 'Eλλψuσταi by the word “Graeci,” the distinction so consistently preserved in our authorized version between “Grecians” and “Greeks” is made to disappear.
