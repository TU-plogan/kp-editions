HENGSTENBERG, Ernst Wilhelm (1802-1869), for more than forty years one of the most conspicuous and able champions of the strictest Lutheran orthodoxy, was born at Fröndenberg, a Westphalian village near Hamm and not far from the Ruhr, on October 20, 1802; received his entire school education under the roof of his father, who was a minister of the Reformed Church, and head of the Fröndenberg Fräuleinstift; and entered the university of Bonn in 1819, shortly before the completion of his seventeenth year. There he attended the lectures of Frey tag and Gieseler on Old Testament exegesis and church history, but his energies were principally devoted to philosophy and philology, and his earliest publication was an edition of the Moallakah of Amru’ 1’ Kais (Amrulkeisi Moallakah cum scholiis Zuzenii edidit, latine vertit, et illustravit JE. G. H, 1823), which gained for him the prize at his graduation in the philosophical faculty, and the public commendation of Sylvestre de Sacy. This was followed in 1824 by a German translation of Aristotle’s AIetaphysica. On quitting Bonn it had been Hengstenberg’s wish to complete his theological studies under Neander and Tholuck in Berlin; but finding himself without the means of doing so, he accepted for a year a situation at Basel as tutor in Oriental languages to J. J. Stähelin. Then it was that, suffering much from ill-health and deeply mourning the loss of his mother, he began to direct his attention, with an ardour formerly unknown to him, to the spiritual truths of the Bible. His studies and experiences at this crisis resulted in a conviction, never afterwards shaken, not only of the divine character ot evangelical religion, but also of the unapproachable adequacy of its expression in the Augsburg Confession. Taking as his motto Psalm cxviii. 17, he resolved thenceforward to devote himself to the uncompromising defence of that creed. In the autumn of 1824 he joined the philosophical faculty of Berlin as a privat-docent, and in the following year he became a licentiate in theology, his theses even then being remarkable for their evangelical fervour and for their emphatic protest against every form of “rationalism,” especially in questions of Old Testament criticism. In 1826 he became professor extraordinarius in theology; and in July 1827 appeared under Hengstenberg’s editorship the first number of the Evangelische Kirchemeitung, a “reactionary’’journal which in his hands was destined to acquire an almost unique reputation as an organ of religious, theological, and ecclesiastical controversy. It did not, however, attain to great notoriety until in 1830 an anonymous article (by E. L. von Gerlach) appeared, which openly charged Professors Gesenius and Wegscheider with infidelity and profanity, and on the ground of these accusations advocated[9:11:653] the interposition of the civil power, thus giving rise to the prolonged “Haifische Streit” as it was called, which was at least effectual in giving the public a due impression of the energy and zeal of the new “evangelical” school. In 1828 the first volume of Hengstenberg’s Christologie des Alten Testaments passed through the press; in the autumn of that year he was promoted to the dignity of professor ordinarius in theology; and in 1829 he married. The remainder of his life, apart from the excitement which its various literary activities imparted to it, was uneventful. He died on the 28th of May 1869.

The following is a list of the principal works of Hengstenberg:— Christologie des Alten Testaments (1829-35; 2d ed., 1854-57; Eng. transi, by R. Keith, 1835-39, also in Clark’s “Foreign Theological Library,” by Th. Meyer and J. Martin, 1854-58), a work of much ingenuity and considerable learning, but which will be differently va'ued according to the hermeneutical principles of the individual critic; Beiträge zur Einleitung in das Alte Testament (1831-39; Engl, transi., “Dissertations on the Genuineness of Daniel and the Integrity of Zechariah,” Edin., 1848, and “Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch,” Edin., 1847), in which the traditional view on each question is strongly upheld, and much capital is made of the absence of harmony among the negative critics; Die Bücher Mosis und Aegypten (1841), spoken of by Diestel as “perhaps Hengstenberg’s most meritorious work;” Die Geschichte Bileams u. seiner Weissagungen (1842; translated into English along with the Dissertations on Daniel and Zechariah mentioned above); Commentar über die Psalmen (1842-45; 2d ed. 1849-52; Eng. transi, by Fairbairn and Thomson, Edin., 1844-48), which shares the merits and defects of the Christologie ; Die Offenbarung Johannis erläutert (1841-51; 2d ed. 1861-62; Eng. transi, by Fairbairn, also in Clark’s “Foreign Theological Library,” 1851-52); Das Hohe Lied ausgelegt (1853); Der Prediger Salomo ausgelegt (1859); Das Evangelium Johannis erläutert (1861-63; 2d ed. 1867-71; Eng. transi. 1865), and Die Weissagungen des Prop)heten Ezechiel erläutert (1867-68). Of minor importance are De rebus Tyriorum commentatio academica (1832); Ueber den Tag des Herrn (1852); Das Passa, ein Vortrag (1853); and Die Opfer der heiligen Schrift (1859). Several series of papers also, as, for example, on “The Retention of the Apocrypha,” “Freemasonry,” “Duelling,” and “The Relation between the Jews and the Christian church,” which originally appeared in the Kirchenzeitung, were afterwards printed in a separate form. Geschichte des Reiches Gottes unter dem Alten Bunde (1869-70), Das Buch Hiob erläutert (1870-75), and Vorlesungen über die Leidensgeschichte (1875) were published, from Hengstenberg’s papers, posthumously. See Bachmann’s Ernst Wilhelm Hengstenberg (1876-79); also his article in Herzog and Plitt’s Encyklopädie (1879).
