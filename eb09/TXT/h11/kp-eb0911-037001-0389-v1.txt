HAGERSTOWN, a city and township of Maryland, United States, capital of Washington county, is situated near the west bank of Antietam creek, 20 miles from its confluence with the Potomac river, and at the junction point of three railways, 86 miles W.N.W. by rail from Baltimore. It is a well-built town with very few wooden houses, and possesses a fine new court-house, a male and a female academy, and a national and a state bank. It depends for its prosperity chiefly on agriculture, and has flour-mills, bone-mills, machine shops, and a tannery, and considerable trade in agricultural produce. The population in 1850 was 3884; in 1860, 4132; and in 1870, 5779, of whom 869 were coloured.
