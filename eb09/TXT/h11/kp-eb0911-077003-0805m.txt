HERSTAL, or in its older form Heristal, a markettown of Belgium, on the left bank of the Meuse, 3 or 4 miles north-east of Liège, and skirting the road which leads from that city to Maestricht. Its population, which in 1876 numbered 11,126, is mainly supported by its coal mines and iron industries. Herstal probably derives its name from being a “Heerstelle” or permanent camp of the Franks. It is well known as the birthplace and family seat of Pippin, the major-domo of the Austrasian kingdom, some few traces of whose castle are still pointed out above the town. And though it cannot maintain its claim to be the birthplace also of Charlemagne, it was undoubtedly a frequent place of residence for this greatest of the Carolingians; and in 870 it gave its name to the treaty by which Charles the Bald and Lewis the German decided the partition of Lotharingia. The lordship of Herstal passed to the house of Nassau in 1444; and in 1702, on the death of William III. of England, its possession was disputed between the house of Orange and the king of Prussia. The decision of the courts was given in 1714 in favour of Prussia; but the new possessors, finding the feelings of the people of Herstal against them, sold the lordship to Liege [9:11:771] for 140,000 thalers. Another Herstal, distinguished as the Saxon, was the place where Charlemagne had his winter quarters in the year 797. It is now the village of Herstelle on the Weser, in the government of Minden.
