HANNO, the chief opponent of Hamilcar and Hannibal at Carthage. Few details are known of his life; his influence on the history of his country, which for more than forty years was very great, can be appreciated only from a detailed history of the period. During the First Punic War he conducted successfully a campaign against some African nation, and he soon became the most trusted leader of the aristocratic party. When in 240 b.c. Hamilcarâ€™s veterans returned from Sicily, clamouring for their promised pay, Hanno was sent to require them to accept partial payment; and on their rebellion he was appointed to the command against them. His unpopularity with the army and his incapacity led to several defeats, and the Government was reluctantly forced to associate Hamilcar with him. After Hamilcar had at length crushed the rebellion, Hanno seems to have remained at Carthage exerting all his influence against the democratic party. During the Second Punic War he advocated peace with Rome; and he even, according to Livy (xxiii. 13), advised that Hannibal should be given up to the Romans. After the battle of Zama (203 b.c.) he was one of the ambassadors sent to Scipio to sue for peace, and after the war he is mentioned among the leaders of the Roman party.
