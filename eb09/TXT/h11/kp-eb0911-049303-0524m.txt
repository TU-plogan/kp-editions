HARRIS, John, D.D. (c. 1667-1719), an English writer, best known as the editor of the Lexicon Technicum, which ranks as the earliest of the long line of English encyclopaedias, and as the compiler of the Collection of Voyages and Travels which passes under his name. He was educated at St J ohn’s College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. degree in 1687, and proceeded M.A. in 1690. Having entered the church, he was soon presented to the rectory of Winchelsea in Sussex; and as early as 1698 he was in sufficient repute as a learned divine to be entrusted with the delivery of the seventh series of the Boyle lectures— Atheistical Objections against the Being of God and His Attributes fairly considered and fully refuted. Between 1702 and 1704 we find him lecturing on mathematics on the foundation of Charles Cox, and advertizing himself as a mathematical tutor at Amen Corner. The friendship of Sir William Cowper, afterwards lord chancellor, soon after raised him to a much higher position. Besides receiving the office of private chaplain to Sir William, he was presented in 1708 with a prebend in Rochester Cathedral, and appointed to the rectory of the united parishes of St Mildred, Bread Street, and St Margaret Moses. In this position he showed himself an ardent supporter of the Government, and got into a bitter quarrel with the Rev. Charles Humphreys, who afterwards was chaplain to Dr Sacheverel. Harris was one of the early members of the Royal Society, and for a time acted as vice-president. Besides his contributions to the society’s Transactions, and the two important works by which he is still remembered, he published a number of treatises on mathematics and occasional sermons; and at his death on September 7, 1719, he was busy completing an elaborate History of Kent, of which the first volume bad just left the press. He is said to have died in poverty brought on by his own bad management of his affairs. There is only one good account of his life, that by Nichols in the Literary Anecdotes, vol. ix., and this even, owing to scarcity of materials, is strangely defective.
