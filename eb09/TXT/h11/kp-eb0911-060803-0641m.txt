HECATAeUS, of Abdera, sometimes confounded with Hecataeus of Miletus, was a Greek historian and philosopher of the 4th century b.c. He was a disciple of Pyrrho and a contemporary of Alexander the Great and Ptolemy Sotor. He accompanied the latter in an expedition to Syria, and during the reign of the same prince sailed up the Nile as far as Thebes. Some fragments of works by him on Egypt and on the Hyperboreans still exist. According to Suidas, he also wrote a treatise on the poetry of Hesiod and Homer. Regarding his authorship of a work on the Jews, of which some fragments remain, there is some disagreement among critics, but in all probability he is not the author of it.

The Ηecαtcei Abderitae Fragmenta were collected by P. Zorn, and published at Altona in 1730. See C. Müller, Histor. Graecor. frag., and Vossius, De Historicis Grιccis.
