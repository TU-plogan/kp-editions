HARAN, or Charran^ (Hebrew, p∏j LXX,, Χαρράν or Χαρρά; Strabo, Κάρραι; Pliny, Carrce or Carrhae-, Arabic, Harran) is the name of a fertile district in the north of Mesopotamia (Padan-aram or Aram-naharaim), and also of a town situated some 10 miles south-eastward of Edessa (Orfa), on the banks of the small river Belik about 50 miles to the north of its junction with the Euphrates. It thus lies immediately on the highway between Arrapachitis and Canaan, and at the point where that highway is crossed by the great western road connecting Media, Assyria, and Babylonia with the Cilician coast. For the Assyrians accordingly it became a strategic position of first-rate importance, and in this aspect it is mentioned in inscriptions as early as the time of Tiglath Pileser I., about 1100 b.c. (see Schrader, Die Keilinschmften und das alte Testament, p. 45; and compare 2 Kings xix. 12, Isa. xxxvii. 12). It also, for the same reason, ultimately became the centre of a considerable commerce (Ezek. xxvii. 23), one of the specialities particularly named being the odoriferous gum derived from the strobus (Pliny, H. N., xii. 40). It was here that Crassus in his eastern expedition waβ attacked and slain by the Parthians (53 B.C.); and here also the emperor Caracalla was murdered at the instigation of Macrinus (217 A.D.). Herodian (iv. 13, 7) mentions the town as possessing in his day a temple of the moon; in the Middle Ages it is mentioned as having been the seat of a particular heathen sect, that of the Haranite Sabeans. It retained its importance down to the period of the Arab ascendency; but by Abulfeda it is mentioned as having before his time fallen into decay. It is now wholly in ruins. According to the patriarchal history (Gen. xi. 31), Haran was the first resting-place of Terah and his family after their migration from Ur of the Chaldees, and here Terah and Nahor remained when Abraham and Lot passed on to Canaan. According to Dr Beke, indeed, this Haran is not the well-known town on the Belik, but “a place of that name (Harrân el-Awamîd) between Abana and Pharpar, the two river3 of Aram or Syria” (see Journ. of Royal Ceog. Soc., vol. xxxii.). His arguments, however, have not been generally accepted as sufficient to set aside the powerful evidence in favour of the Mesopotamian site.
