HAROLD III., surnamed Stern in Council (Harald Haardraade or Hardrada), son of Jarl Sigurd, half-brother of King Olaf the Holy, and descended by his father from Harold I., was one of the most distinguished warriors among the old Norse kings. About his fifteenth year he made his escape wounded from the battle of Stiklestad (1030), where his half-brother Olaf was killed; and after staying till he was cured of his wounds with a “bonde” in a [9:11:485] forest, he made his way to Sweden, whence after the winter wa3 over he went to Russia, where he was kiudly received by King Yaroslaf of Novgorod. He remained in Russia for several years, but, being refused the hand of a Russian princess, he betook himself with several companions to’ Constantinople, and became chief commander of the famous Byzantine life-guards known as Varangians, and consisting almost wholly of Norsemen. At the head of these warriors he gained many victories over the Saracens in Sicily and Italy. It is even said that in a crusade against the infidels he penetrated as far as Jerusalem, but most probably if he entered that city it was in the peaceful character of a pilgrim. Returning after his exploits to Constantinople, he was refused the hand of a niece of the empress Zoe, because, according to the legend, the empress herself was enamoured of him; and offended at the refusal he one night made his escape with two galleys, carrying with him all his treasures, and also it is said the princess whose hand had been denied him, whom, however, he put on shore after he had passed the Bosphorus, with a message to the empress that, if lie had so willed, her power would have been vain against his strategy aud skill. He now set sail for Russia, where he was warmly welcomed by King Yaroslaf; and as he was now a man of great fame and wealth Yaroslaf gave him in marriage his daughter Ellisof or Elizabeth, whose hand he had formerly asked in vain. Soon after his marriage he resolved to return home and if possible to win the crown of Norway from his nephew Magnus the Good. With that purpose he about the year 1045 came to an agreement with his relative Swend of Denmark, who had been driven by Magnus into exile in Sweden; but Magnus, having obtained news of the intended joint expedition against him, entered into communication with Harold, and agreed to share with him the government of Norway, each ruling over a separate division. They now turned their united forces against Swend, drove him from Denmark, and completely prostrated his power; but just when he had resolved finally in despair to give up the contest, Magnus about the year 1047 took suddenly ill and died, bequeathing on his death-bed the whole of Norway to Harold and Denmark to Swend. Such a bequest did not however coincide with the desires of Harold, and between him and Swend a constant warfare raged for several years, until in 1064 they agreed to a peace by which each retained his dominions according to the old established boundaries. The chief motive of Harold in consenting to this arrangement was probably that he might be free to embark on a purpose of wider ambition, namely, to revive in his own person the old Scandinavian sovereignty of England which had ended with the death of Hardicanute. The story goes that he was instigated to the enterprise by a visit from Tostig, the exiled earl of Northumbria; but whether that be so or not, he in 1066 set sail for England with an immense fleet, which carried his wife Ellisof, his son Olaf, his treasures, and more than half of all his fighting men. After touching at Orkney, where he left his wife, he proceeded southwards to the Tyne, and was there joined by Tostig and by a contingent of troops from Malcolm of Scotland. From the Tyne they sailed southwards along the coast of Yorkshire, stopping at intervals to ravage the country for provisions, and after proceeding up the Humber cast anchor on the left bank of the Ouse near the village of Riccall. Leaving a detachment under his son Olaf to guard the fleet, Harold along with Tostig. marched with a great force towards York, and, defeating the Northumbrians with heavy loss at Fulford on September 20th, received the surrender of the city on September 24th. Meanwhile Harold of England, having heard of the Norse invasion, was marching northwards from London day and night with an immense army; and passing through York on the day after its surrender, he appeared suddenly on the afternoon before the Norsemen encamped at Stamfordbridge. Taken by surprise, the Norsemen fought nevertheless with stubborn courage and fierce energy, but though the battle was for some time doubtful it ended at nightfall in their total overthrow, with a slaughter so enormous that the great majority of them lay dead upon the field. Tostig was slain and also Harold Hardrada himself, who, towering head and shoulders above all his warriors, was inflicting death on all who dared to meet him, till struck by an arrow in the windpipe he received the wound which laid him low. According to some writers his body ultimately found burial in Norway.
