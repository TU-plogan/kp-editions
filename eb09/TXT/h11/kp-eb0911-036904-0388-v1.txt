HAGENBACH, Karl Rudolf (1801-1874), distinguished as a church historian and as an expounder of the so-called “Vermittelungstheologie,” or mediation theology of Germany, was born March 4, 1801, at Basel, where his father, a man of considerable talent and scientific repute, was a practising physician. His preliminary education was received at a Pestalozzian school, and afterwards at the gymnasium, whence in due course he passed to the newly reorganized local university. Carefully brought up within a church in which the strictest orthodoxy still continued to hold undisputed sway, familiar at the same time from boyhood with his father’s expressions of approval of the principles of the French Revolution, himself of an ardent, sympathetic, inquiring, and devout temperament, he early devoted himself to theological studies and to the service of the church, while at the same time cherishing and developing broad “humanistic” tendencies which found expression in many ways and especially in an enthusiastic admiration for the writings of Herder. The years 1820-23 were spent first at Bonn, where Lücke exerted a powerful influence on the formation of his opinions, and afterwards at Berlin, where Schleiermacher, and still more Neander, became permanently his masters. Returning in 1823 to Basel, where De Wette had recently been appointed to a theological chair, he distinguished himself greatly by his “liabilitations-schrift” or trial-dissertation, entitled Observationes historico-hermeneuticce circa Origenis methodum interpretavdoe sacras Scripturoe; in the following year he became professor extraordinarius, and in 1829 professor ordinarius of theology. Apart from his special academic labours during many years in connexion with the history of dogma and of the church (which first owed to him their recognition as distinct branches of study at Basel), he lived a life of great and varied usefulness as a theologian, a preacher, and a citizen: and at his “jubilee” in 1873, not only the university and town of Basel but also the various churches of Switzerland united to do him honour. He died at Basel, June 7, 1874.

Hagenbach was a voluminous author in many departments (as will be seen from the list of his works which is given below), but it is as a writer on church history that he is specially distinguished, and is likely to be longest and most widely known. Though neither so learned and condensed as the contributions of Gieseler, nor so original and profound as those of Neander, his lectures are written with remarkable clearness and attractiveness, and are deservedly appreciated at once for their warm glow of sympathy with his subject and for their entire freedom from narrow sectarian prejudice. In dogmatics, while avowedly a champion of the “mediation theology” based upon the fundamental conceptions of Herder and Schleiermacher, he was much less revolutionary in his aims and in his results than were many others of his school. To the last he sought to maintain the old confessional documents, and to make the objective and churchly prevail over the purely subjective manner of viewing theological questions. But he himself was aware that in the endeavour to do so he was not always successful, and that his delineations of Christian dogma often betrayed a vacillating and uncertain hand. His works include a remarkably clear Tabellarische Uebersicht der Dogmengeschichte (1828); Encyclopädie u. Methodologie der thcol. Wissenschaften (1833); Vorlesungen über Wesen u. Geschichte der Reformation u. des Protestantismus (1834-43); Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte (1840-41, 5th ed., 1867; English transi., 1850); Vorlesungen über die Geschichte der alten Kirche (1853-55); Vorlesungen über die Kirchcmgeschichte des Mittelalters (1860-61); Grundlinien der Homiletik u. Liturgik (1863); also biographies of Oecolampadius and Myconius and a Geschichte der theol. Schule Basels (1860). His Predigten have been published in nine volumes (1858-75), and he is also author of two volumes of poems entitled Luther u. seine Zeit (1838), and Gedichte (1846). The lectures on church history under the general title Vorlesungen uber die Kirchengeschichte von der ältesten Zeit bis zum l⅛ten Jahr·, hundert have been recently reissued in seven volumes (1868-72).
