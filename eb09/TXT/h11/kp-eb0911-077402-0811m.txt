HERVEY, James (1714-1758), a popular religious writer of the 18th century, was born at Hardingstone, near Northampton, on February 26, 1714, and was educated at the grammar school of Northampton, whence in 1731 he passed to Lincoln College, Oxford. At the university he came under the influence of John Wesley and o , thers of that school, and for some time manifested an inclination towards their theology; ultimately, however, while retaining his regard for the men and his sympathy with their religious aims, he adopted a thoroughly Calvinistic creed, and resolved to retain connexion with the Established Church. Having taken holy orders in 1737, he became curate to his father in the family livings of Weston Favell and Colling-tree, to which he himself succeeded in 1752. There, under the disadvantage of very weak health, he laboured with great diligence in the discharge of his parochial duties, and also wrote numerous religious works, which, though of but slight literary or theological value, rapidly became highly popular, and in many English and Scottish houses, especially of the humbler class, took a place on the same shelf with the Pilgrim ’ s Progress and the Whole Duty of Man. His earliest work, Meditations and Contemplations, containing “Meditations among the Tombs,” “Reflexions on a Flower Garden,” and a “Descant on Creation” (1746), and “Contemplation on the Night and Starry Heavens” (1747), said to have been modelled on Boyle’s Occasional Reflexions on various Subjects, within fourteen years passed through as many editions. Theron and Λspasio, or α Series of Letters upon the most important and interesting Subjects, which appeared in 1755, and was equally well received, called forth some adverse criticism even from Calvinists, on account of tendencies which were considered to lead 'to antinomianism, and was strongly objected to by Wesley in his Preservative against unsettled Notions in Religion. Besides carrying into England the theological disputes to which Fisher’s Marrow of Modem Divinity had given rise in Scotland, it also led to what is known as the Sandemanian controversy as to the nature of saving faith. Hervey died on December 25, 1758. A “new and complete” edition of his Works, with a memoir, appeared in 1797. ' See also Collection of the Letters of James Hervey, to which is prefixed an account of his Life and Death (1760).
