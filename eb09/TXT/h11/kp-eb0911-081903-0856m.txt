HILLARD, George Stillman (1808-1879), an American author, was born at Machias, State of Maine, September 22, 1808. After graduating at Harvard College in 1828, he became joint rector of the Round Hill Seminary at Northampton. In 1833 he was called to the Boston bar, where he soon obtained a good practice. He was chosen a member of the common council of Boston in 1845, and he was for six months its president. In 1849 he was elected a member of the State legislature. The engrossing character of his professional and other engagements did not, however, prevent him from devoting a large portion of his time to literature. Besides editing successively the Christian Register (a Unitarian paper), The Jurist, and the Boston Courier, he published an edition of Spenserâ€™s works (in 5 vols., 1839), and a selection from the works of Walter Savage Landor (1856), and wrote Six Months in Italy (2 vols., 1833), Life and Campaigns of George B. M l Clellan (1865), a series of school-books which have met with wide acceptance, and various articles in periodicals and encyclopaedias. In addition to this he made frequent successful appearances as a public lecturer. From 1867 to 1878 he was United States district attorney for Massachusetts. He died 27th January 1879.
