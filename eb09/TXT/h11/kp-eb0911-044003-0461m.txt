HANLEY, a market-town and municipal borough of Staffordshire, England, is situated in the centre of the pottery district, 2 miles E.N.E. of Stoke-upon-Trent, and 18 miles N. of Stafford. It is indebted for its rise and [9:11:441] prosperity to its pottery manufactures, which include porcelain, encaustic tiles, and earthenware, and give employment to the greater part of the population, women and children being employed almost as largely as men. In the neighbourhood coal and iron are obtained. The streets, which are paved with brick, are wide and regular, and in the suburbs there are a number of fine villas. The principal public buildings are the six churches (St John’s being a handsome structure with a tower 100 feet in height) and the dissenting chapels, the town-hall, the mechanics’ institute, the museum, the theatre, and the national and board schools. There is also a flourishing Government school of art. Hanley, which includes the former township of Shelton, received a municipal constitution in 1857. It is tl∣e central and most important of the group of towns constituting the parliamentary borough of Stoke-upon-Trent. The population of Hanley in 1861 was 31,953, and in 1871 39,976.
