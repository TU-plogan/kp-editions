HAROLD II. surnamed Greyskin (Harald Graafel), son of Eric Bloodyaxe, succeeded Haco the Good in the government of Norway about the year 960, having bribed his other brothers to be satisfied with reigning as under kings in the other provinces. It would appear that Harold himself was disposed to govern peacefully and well, but his brothers now resolved to take vengeance on the friends of the late King Haco, and murdered among others Jarl Sigurd. They, however, failed of their purpose on Haco, his son, who after for some time resisting their attacks fled to Denmark, where he obtained the assistance of King Harold Bluetooth, with whose help he defeated and slew Harold Greyskin, upon which, under Harold Bluetooth, he became ruler of Norway with the title of jarl, according to some in the year 965, to others in 969, and to others in 975.
