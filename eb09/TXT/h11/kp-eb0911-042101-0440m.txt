HAMILTON, William (1704-1754), a minor Scottish poet, the author of The Braes of Yarrow, was born in 1704, probably at Bangour in Linlithgowshire, the second son of James Hamilton of Bangour, a member of the Scottish bar. It is supposed that he studied at the university of Edinburgh; and it is certain that he received an education which enabled him to enjoy the classical writers of Greece and Rome, and to be a congenial associate in after years with such men as Allan Ramsay and Henry Home. As early as 1724 we find him contributing to Ramsay’s Tea Table Miscellany. In 1745 Hamilton joined the cause of Prince Charles, and, though it is doubtful whether he actually bore arms, he certainly celebrated the battle of Prèston-pans in an ode beginning—“As over Gladsmuir’s bloodstained field.” After the disaster of Culloden he lurked for several months in the Highlands, and at length escaped to France; but in 1749 the influence of his friends at home procured him permission to return to Scotland, and in the following year he obtained possession of the family estate of Bangour. In 1751 he married for the second time, but the state of his health was such that he soon afterwards went abroad, and he died at Lyons on 25th March 1754.

Hamilton has left behind him a considerable number of what are best described as poetical effusions, manyof them pleasing and tasteful, but none of them except the Braes of Yarrow of striking originality. The first collection of his pieces was published without his permission or even knowledge by Foulis (Glasgow, 1748), and introduced by a preface from the pen of Adam Smith. Another edition with corrections by himself was brought out by his friends in 1760, and to this was prefixed a portrait engraved by Sir Robert Strange. Though the poems have been since reprinted in Anderson’s British Poets (vol. ix. ), in Sharpe’s Collection of the British Poets, and in Chalmers’s English Poets (vol. xv.), there was no separate edition between 1760 and 1850, when James Paterson edited The Poems and Songs of William Hamilton. This volume contains several poems till then unpublished, and presents a bibliographical introduction and life of the author.
