HAZLETON, a post - borough of Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, U.S., is situated about 80 miles N.N.W. of Philadelphia. Owing to its elevated and healthy situation, its agreeable climate, and the facilities afforded by its railway connexions with other districts, it has become a favourite and fashionable health-resort in summer. The manufactures include both iron and timber; and a part of the rolling-stock of the Lehigh Valley Railway is made in the town. There are several valuable coalmines in the vicinity. The population in 1860 was only 1707; in 1870 it was 4317, and since then it has considerably increased.
