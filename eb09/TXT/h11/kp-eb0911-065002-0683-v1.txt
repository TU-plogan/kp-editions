HÉNAULT, Charles Jean François (1685-1770), French historian, was born in Paris 8th February 1685. His father, a farmer-general of taxes, was a man of literary tastes; and young Hénault obtained a good education at the Jesuit college and the College des Quatre-Nations. Captivated by the eloquence of Massillon, he in his fifteenth year entered the oratory with the view of becoming a preacher, but after two years’ residence he changed his intention, and, inheriting a position which secured him access to the most select society of Paris, he at an early period achieved distinction by his gay, witty, and graceful manners, and by his literary talent as manifested in the composition of various light poetical pieces, and of two discourses which respectively gained a prize at the French Academy in 1707, and at the Académie des Jeux Floraux in 1708. In 1706 he became councillor of the parliament of Paris, and in 1710 he was chosen president of the court of enquêtes. He was admitted into the French Academy in 1723, and subsequently into the leading literary societies of Europe. After the death of Bernard de Coubert he became superintendent of the household of Queen Marie Leczinska, whose intimate friendship he had previously enjoyed. On his recovery in his fiftieth year from a dangerous malady, he professed to have undergone religious conversion and retired into private life, devoting the remainder of his days to study and devotion. His devotion was, however, according to the Marquis d’Argenson “exempt from fanaticism, persecution, bitterness, and intrigue ;” and it did not prevent him from continuing his friendship with Voltaire, to whom it is said he had formerly rendered the service of saving the manuscript of La Henriade, when its author was about to commit it to the flames. The literary work on which Hénault bestowed his chief attention was the Al)rege Chronologique, first published in 1744 without the author’s name. It is a model of its kind, and is valuable both for popular use and as a work of reference. In the compass of two volumes he has comprised the whole history of France from the earliest times to the death of Louis XIV. His information is for the most part drawn from original sources, and for such a work the number of errors committed by Hénault was remarkably small. The results of deep researches and lengthened disquisitions on public law are summed up in a few words. The moral and political reflexions are always short and generally as fresh and pleasing as they are just. A few masterly strokes reproduce the leading features of each age and the characters of its illustrious men; accurate chronological tables set forth the most interesting events in the history of each sovereign and the names of the great men who flourished during his reign; and interspersed throughout the work are occasional chapters on the social and civil state of the country at the close of each era in its history. Continuations of the work have been made at separate periods by Fantin des Odoards,byAuguis with notes by Walckenaer, and by Michaud. Besides some other historical works of minor importance Hénault wrote several dramatic pieces of no particular merit. He died at Paris, 24th November 1770. His Mémoires, published in 1854, are somewhat fragmentary and disconnected, but contain many interesting anecdotes and details regarding persons of note.
