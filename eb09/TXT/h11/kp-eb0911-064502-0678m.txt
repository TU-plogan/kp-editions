HEMEROBAPTISTS, an ancient Jewish sect, so named from their observing a practice of daily ablution as an essential part of religion. Epiphanius, who mentions their doctrine as the fourth heresy among the Jews, classes the Hemerobaptists doctrinally with the Pharisees, from whom they differed only in, like the Sadducees, denying the resurrection of the dead. The name has been sometimes given to the Mendaeans on account of their frequent ablutions; and in the Clementine Homilies (ii. 23) St John the Baptist is spoken of as a Hemerobaptist. Mention of the sect is made by Hegesippus (see Euseb., Hist. Eccl., iv. 22) and by Justin Martyr in the Dialogue with Tryphon.
