HENZADA, a district in Pegu division, British Burmah, lying between 16° 49' and 18° 30' N. lat., and between 94’ 51' and 96° 7' E. long., with an area of 4047 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by the Prome district, on the E. by the Pegu Yomas, on the S. by Rangoon, Thonkhwa, and Bassein districts, and on the W. by the Arakan Yoma range. Henzada district stretches from north to south in one vast plain, forming the valley of the Ira wadi, and is divided by that river into two nearly equal portions. This country is protected from inundation by immense embankments, so that almost the whole area is suitable for rice cultivation. The chief mountains are the Arakan and Pegu Yoma ranges. The greatest elevation of the Arakan Yomas in Henzada, attained in the latitude of Myan-oung v is 4003 feet above sea-level. Numerous torrents pour down from the two boundary ranges, and unite in the plains to form large streams, which fall into the chief rivers of the district, viz., the Irawadi, Hlaing, and Bassein. The forests comprise almost every variety of timber found in Burmah.

The inhabitants of Henzada district in 1876 numbered 501,213. The number of immigrants into the district during the ten years ending 1876 was 90,797. The chief occupation of the people is agriculture. Nearly all the large towns are on the right bank of the Irawadi. The chief towns have populations as follows:— Henzada, 15,307; Kyan-kheng, 8761; Myan-oung, 5859; and Meng-gyi, on the left bank of the Irawadi, 15,770. The staple crops of the district are rice, sesamum, cotton, and tobacco. The total area under cultivation in 1876 was 363,048 acres. The other products are cotton, indigo, oil-seeds, pease and pulses, cocoa and betel nuts, jxtn-vine, &c. The revenue in 1876-77 was £132,733. In 1876 the police force consisted of 400 men.

The district was once a portion of the Talaing kingdom of Pegu, afterwards annexed to the Burmese empire in 1753, and has no history of its own. During the second Burmese war, after Prome had been seized, the Burmese on the right bank of the Irawadi crossed the river and offered resistance to the British, but were completely routed. Meanwhile, in Tharawadi, or the country east of the Irawadi, and in the south of Henzada, much disorder was caused by a revolt, the leaders of which were, however, defeated by the British, and their gangs dispersed.
