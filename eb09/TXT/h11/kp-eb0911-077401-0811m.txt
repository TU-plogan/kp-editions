HERULI, Aeruli, or Eruli, a nomadic and warlike German tribe who inhabited the northern shores of the Black Sea, but afterwards divided into various sections and wandered into different parts of Europe. They made their fiÂ· st appearance in history in the 3d century, as taking part with the Goths in their incursions against the eastern provinces of the Roman empire. In the 4th century they acknowledged the overlordship of the Gothic king Ermanric, but when Attila, king of the Huns, made his descent upon Gaul, they joined his standard. After the overthrow of the Huns, in which they suffered considerably, they established an organized and distinct confederacy on the banks of the Danube, and under the leadership of Odoacer, assisted in 476 in the overthrow of the Western empire. Under their king Rudolf they in the beginning of the 6th century attempted the subjugation of the Longobardi, but were defeated and dispersed, some of them proceeding to Scandinavia, and others being allowed by the emperor Anastasius to settle on the south bank of the Danube. In the time of Justinian some of them embraced Christianity. A large portion of them afterwards joined the Gepidae in their wars against the Eastern empire; but others who remained afforded Justinian important assistance in his wars against the Vandals and East Goths, so that they frequently fought against one another. About the end of the 6th century they became submerged and lost in other nations, and disappeared from historical records. The Heruli were bold, hardy, and extremely pugnacious. For a considerable period they retained intact their strong individuality, and presented a firm resistance to the influences of surrounding civilizations. They put to death without mercy the sick and the aged, and are said even to have offered human sacrifices.
