HERMES is the name of a Greek god (corresponding to the Roman Mercury) whose origin and real character are perhaps more difficult to define than is the case with any other Greek deity; here it is possible only to give an outline of one definite theory, and refer the reader to the works quoted at the end. He was not a god worshipped by the pure Doric or Ionic races, but is found in most places where Aeolian, Achaean, and Pelasgic tribes can be traced. If we begin with the rudest races, summed up generally under the title of Pelasgic, we find Hermes often connected with the mysterious Cabiri. These deities, in the accounts we have, vary in number and sex, being sometimes two, sometimes three or four. We may conclude that originally they were a pair, male and female, whom we may compare with Uranus and Gaea, or with Cronus and Rhea. Often the female is doubled, as mother and daughter, resembling the relation of Demeter and Persephone; while the male also is transformed either into twin brothers, or into a father and his son by one of the female deities. Certainly the male deity seems sometimes to be regarded as Hermes, sometimes as Hephaestus (see Hephaestus), while in other places the two are associated. Hermes and Hephaestus are perhaps local varieties of one type, which after having acquired distinct individuality in their separate homes were brought beside each other by subsequent intercourse. Hence we may understand how the epithet <xγγ∈λoς and the office of messenger between gods and men, which in the Pig Veda belong to Agni, the fire, are in Greek mythology attached to Hermes. This Pelasgic Hermes is an ithyphallic deity, the god of fertility and reproductive power, and bestower of riches in flocks and herds. Corresponding to this religious conception we have in mythology such epithets as ∈pιoυvιoς, ίκάκητα, &c.; and in the hymn to Aphrodite (written perhaps in Aeolis in the 9th century B.c.), Hermes and the Sileni (Latin Silvani) are the companions of the mountain nymphs. So in Arcadia, one of the chief seats of his worship, where on Cyllene his birthplace was shown, he was by Penelope the father of Pan. Penelope, the “torch-eyed” (Ahrens in Philol., 1879, p. 205), is a form of Athene, Odysseus of Hermes; and Hermes and Athene are associated as Hephaestus with Athene in Attica. In the very mixed Attic people, it is not surprising to find the worship of Hermes widespread; it is sometimes said to have been introduced from Samothrace. In Athens Hermes is the god of social life and intercourse in general, of streets and doorways, and of the palaestra. He is worshipped as αγοραίος and πρoπνλαιoς ; and Hermae, pillars supporting a bearded head and furnished with a phallus, stood all over the city. In Boeotia also we find Hermes, especially at Tanagra, where Hermes the champion, and Hermes κρωψόρος, the averter of diseases, were worshipped. The Doric god Apollo, with the titles Agyieus and Paion, corresponds most closely to these last aspects of Hermes. As god of social intercourse he easily grows into the impersonation of cleverness, and at last into the patron of thieves. If we pass from religion to mythology, where we find all the successive ways of expressing views of nature preserved to us side by side, we find an immense variety of traditions. The most common subject in these tales is the struggle between darkness and light. When it is said that Hermes stole the oxen of Apollo, and after killing two of them nailed their skins on a rock, we have one of a class of myths described at length by Kuhn (Entwickelungsstufen der Mythologie). The slain animal is the sun, who is killed every evening; and the hide, i.e., the sky of night, is either hung up on the tree of heaven (as is the Golden Fleece) or fastened with the starheaded nails. Again, when Io, the moon, is watched by the hundred-eyed Argus (Sanskrit rajas, “darkness”), the star-studded sky, Hermes slays Argus with a stone, the same which Cadmus and Jason use, viz., the rising sun. In both cases Hermes is the sun-god as hidden during the night away among the souls of the dead; hence the Chthonian character [9:11:750] so frequently attached to him. The rod with which he lulls men to sleep is the same sceptre that the ruler of the dead, Yama or Rhadamanthus, Minos or Hades, always bears (Kuhn in Zft., iv. p. 123); he is also the sender of dreams; we find him worshipped among the Chthonian deities at Cnidus, and on vases accompanied by the Chthonian dog. We are now able to understand a fact which is perhaps the most interesting point connected with Hermes. Kuhn first pointed out the identity of the Greek 'Ep/z·etas with the Sanskrit Sârameyas, and though the connexion has been doubted by various writers, as Mannhardt [Wald-und Feld-Kulte, ii. pref.) and others, yet no valid objection has ever been offered on etymological grounds (see Benfey in Abhandl. Gott. Ges., 1877). Amid the difficulties which still envelop the translation and the mythology of the Vedas, it is, however, even more difficult to discover the original character of the two Sârameyau and their mother Saramâ, than it is to determine the nature of Hermes. The two Sârameyau are mentioned twice in the Rig Veda (vii. 55; x. 14); they are two dogs, are said both to guard the way to the abode of the dead and refuse a passage to the impious, and also to act as the messengers of Yama, carrying away the souls when the time of death has arrived. Saramâ also seems to be regarded as the messenger or the dog of Indra; and Hermes appears regularly as the companion and helper of all the light-heroes on their adventures. One epithet of these dogs is Çarvara, spotted, which in its Greek form Cerberus (Benfey, Vedica, p. 149) is the name of the dog that guards the gate of the lower world. Now we find in Rome that two lares proestites, children of Mercury and Egeria, are said to guard dwellings and streets in the form of dogs; and in the German legend the dog who attends the wild huntsman Wuotan, i.e., the sun hidden during the seven winter months, is closely related to the dwarfs or spirits of the dead, and is called by their name (Kuhn, Westf. Sagen, i. p. 69c). So Hermes, whom we have seen as king of the dead, is as ψυχοπομπός also the conductor of souls to their future home; we may therefore count the dog (or dogs) as ultimately identical in character with the king of the dead. Sonne (on Charis in Kuhn’s Zft., x.)has pointed out how these primitive conceptions commonly pass through the stage of animals before reaching that of gods; and in mythology we have the two stages preserved side by side as distinct beings. The Hindu Kubera, lord of the treasures of the lower world, who may be identified with Pluto or with Hermes, is styled “Lord of the hosts of the Sârameyas.”

In this account there has been no room left for the idea of Hermes as connected with the wind. The sun, after he has set at night, is the same as the sun hidden during the dreary months of winter, who then rides abroad in the tempest. The wind is then easily conceived as his servant and messenger, and is often considered to carry away the souls of the dead (see Harpies). From his connexion with the wind, Hermes is represented with winged shoes. But with Roscher (Hermes der Wind-Gott) to see in Hermes simply the wind is to take a narrow view and to ignore the character of primitive Aryan thought.

In art, besides the Hermae already described, Hermes is in the archaic time represented as a man with pointed beard, wearing a chlamys and the broad hat called petasus; his symbols are the staff (κηρυκeιοv) and the winged shoes (talaria). The ideal type of Hermes was probably modelled after the statue by Praxiteles in the Heraion at Olympia. This statue, which was recently discovered by the German expedition, represented the god leaning with his left arm on a rock and supporting on it the infant Bacchus. The right arm, which is lost, probably held the caduceus. The form shows a perfect combination of agility and strength.
