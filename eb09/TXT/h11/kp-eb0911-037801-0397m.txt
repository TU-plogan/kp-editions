HAKE(fWerlÂ·uccius vulgaris), a fish belonging to the family of cod-fishes (Gadidoe), differing from the common cod in having only two dorsal and one anal fin. It is very common on the coasts of Europe and eastern North America, but its flesh is much less esteemed than that of the true Gadi. Specimens 4 feet in length are not scarce. A closely allied fish inhabits the coasts of Chili and New Zealand.
