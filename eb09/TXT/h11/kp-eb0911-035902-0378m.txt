HACHETTE, Jean Nicolas Pierre (1769-1834), an eminent French mathematician, was born at Mézières, where his father was a bookseller, on the 6th May 1769. For his early education he proceeded first to the college of Charleville, and afterwards to that of Rheims. In 1788 he returned to Mézières, where he Was attached to the school of engineering as draughtsman to the professors of physics and chemistry. When twenty-three years of age he succeeded from among a number of candidates in gaining the professorship of hydrography at Collioure and Port-Vendre. While there he sent several able papers, in which some questions of navigation were treated geometrically, to Monge, at that time minister of marine, through whose influence he obtained an appointment in Paris. Thence he passed to a deputy-professorship at Mézières, and towards the close of 1794, when the École Polytechnique was established, he was chosen one of its staff, being appointed along with Monge over the department of descriptive geometry. There he instructed some of the ablest Frenchmen of the day, among them Poisson, Arago, and Fresnel. Accompanying Guyton de Morveau in his expedition, earlier in the year, he was present at the battle of FIeurus, and entered Brussels with the French army. In 1816, on the accession of Louis XVIII., he was expelled from his chair by Government, at the same time that his friend and fellow-worker Monge was removed from the Institute. He retained, however, till his death the office of professor in the faculty of sciences in the École Normale, to which he had been appointed in 1810—the same year in which he married the daughter of the physician Maugras. The necessary royal assent was in 1823 refused to the election of Hachette to the Academy of Sciences, and it was not till 1831, after the Revolution, that he obtained that well-merited honour. He died at Paris, January 16, 1834⅛ Hachette was held in high esteem for his private worth, as [9:11:360] well as for his scientific attainments and great public services. His labours were chiefly in the field of descriptive geometry, with its application to the arts and mechanical engineering. It was left to him to develop the geometry of Monge, and to him also is due in great measure the rapid advancement which France made soon after the establishment of the École Polytechnique in the construction of machinery. His writings on descriptive geometry are still of value.

Hachette’s principal works are his Deux Suppléments à la Géométrie Descriptive de Monge, 1811 and 1818; Éléments de Géométrie à trois dimensions, 1817; Collection des Epures de Géométrie, &c., 1795 and 1817; Applications de Géométrie Descriptive, 1817; Traité de Géométrie Descriptive, &c., 1822; Traité Elémentaire des Machines, 1811; Correspondance sur VÉcole Polytechnique, 1804- 1815. He also contributed many valuable papers to the leading scientific journals of his time.
