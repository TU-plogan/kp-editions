HAYNE, Robert Young (1791-1840), American statesman, was born in St Paulâ€™s parish, Colleton district, South Carolina, on November 10, 1791. He studied law at Charleston, S.C., and in his twenty-first year was admitted to the bar there, but in the same year (1812) served for a short time as a soldier in the war with Great Britain. Returning to practise in Charleston, Hayne was elected a member of the State legislature in 1814, and four years later became speaker. Shortly afterwards he accepted the post of attorney-general for his native State, though he declined the same office for the United States. On being elected a senator of the United States, Hayne at once showed himself an active foe to protective legislation, and vigorously combated the tariffs of 1824 and 1828. A bill having been passed in 1832 removing the duty from those imports only which were not in competition with home manufactures, the state of South Carolina passed an ordinance nullifying the bill, on the ground that it was unconstitutional. President Jackson denounced this proceeding, and South Carolina, appointing Hayne governor, was preparing to defend its position by arms, when Congress made the desired change in the tariff, and South Carolina repealed its act. Hayne, on retiring from the governorship in 1834, was elected mayor of Charleston, and continued to take an active interest in public affairs till his death at Ashville, North Carolina, September 24, 1840. See Life and Speeches of B. F. Hayne, 1845.
