HARDY, Alexandre (1560-1631), the most fertile of all dramatic authors, next to Lope de Vega and Calderon, merits a place in dramatic literature on that account alone. He is said to have written upwards of six hundred plays, of which forty-one were printed in his own edition of 1624-28, and may still be read. It cannot be charged upon modern writers that they are slow to see merit in early French authors, but it has been found impossible by any to admire the hasty works of a man who wrote a tragedy in eight days, and did not scruple to borrow situations from any quarter where he could find them. He at first followed a strolling company as its author, and ended by becoming the dramatist of the Théâtre du Marais. He knew how to make the most of his situations; he, evidently by constant practice, became a master of stage business and stage effects; he knew the kind of dialogue—coarse and rough •—which would please his audience; his art, compared with that of Molière, his successor, is the art of a carpenter compared with that of a sculptor. To the student of the drama Hardy will always be an interesting figure, appearing as he does between the degraded morality and the modern comedy, an imitator alike of Italian pastoral and Spanish tragedy. He had no sympathy with the classical pretensions of Jodelle; he gave little heed to art; he thought entirely of what would succeed for the moment. One piece alone of Hardy’s has succeeded in arresting the attention of critics, the tragedy of Mariamne. Hardy lived long enough to witness the first successes of Corneille.
