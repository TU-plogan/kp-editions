HAMILTON, Sir William (1730-1803), antiquary and patron of the fine arts, was born in 1730 of a noble but needy Scottish family. Of his early life and education we know nothing beyond the fact that he was equerry to Prince George, afterwards George III., whose foster-brother he is said to have been; but in his twenty-fifth year he married a young and beautiful heiress, whose fortune placed him in affluence. In the first parliament of George III. Hamilton sat as member for Midhurst; and in 1764 he was accredited ambassador to Naples, an office which he retained till 1800. On proceeding to his post his attention and interest were at once awakened by the discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum, and he took up the study of antiquities with ardour. The Porcinari collection of Greek and Etruscan vases, purchased in 1765, was the nucleus of a valuable collection of his own, now for the most part in the British Museum. Engravings and descriptions of the most valuable pieces are given in the famous Antiquités Etrusques, Grecques, et Domaines, tirées du Cabinet de Μ. Hamilton, edited by D’Hancarville, and published at Naples in 1766-67. Hamilton also contributed liberally to the museum at Portici, and gave much attention to the MSS. and other valuable articles rescued from the buried cities; but his efforts were almost nullified by the inertness of the Neapolitan court, which was even suspicious of his zeal. Natural history and science also were not neglected by him. Between 1764 and 1767 Hamilton paid numerous visits to Vesuvius, Etna, and the Lipari Islands, accompanied by a young artist, Pietro Fabris, who made drawings of the noteworthy objects and appearances under Hamilton’s directions. The result of these excursions, first sent as letters to the Royal Society, of which he became a member in 1766, was afterwards expanded into two works,— Observations upon Mount Vesuvius, Mount Etna, and other Volcanoes of the Two Sicilies, published at London in 1772, and Campi Phlegraei, a collection of plates illustrating the volcanic phenomena, accompanied by concise descriptions in English and French, published at Naples in 1776-77. A Supplement to the latter described the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 1779. Hamilton’s daughter died in 1775, and his first wife in 1782. In 1772 he was made K.C.B., and in 1791 privy councillor. His continued interest in art and antiquity is manifested by his contributions to the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society from 1767 [9:11:421] to 1795, and to the Arch<xologia in 1777, as well as by his generosity to artists and antiquaries, such as Morghen, Winckelmann, and Piaggi. Recalled in 1800, he died April 6, 1803.

Sir William Hamilton’s second wife, Emma Lyon or Harte, whose name is so notoriously associated with that of Nelson, was born of very humble parents at Preston in Lancashire, about April 26, 1764. Her youth was spent in domestic service, and it was first as attendant on a lady of fashion that she learned to develop her talent for singing and mimicry. Having lost this situation she became waitress in a tavern frequented by actors, and soon entered upon a gay and dissolute career. Her beauty attracted among others the painter Romney, who depicted her in no fewer than twenty-three of his works. Sir William Hamilton married her in 1791; and, going with him the same year to Naples, she speedily acquired an ascendency over the mind cf the queen, which at the instigation of Nelson she used for the advantage of the British fleet. On the death of Sir William she lived in a house at Merton Place, provided for her by Nelson, but on his death in 1805 she soon squandered the modest fortune left her by her husband, and after being imprisoned for debt, retired with Nelson’s daughter Horatia to Calais, where she died, January 16,1815. Her Memoirs appeared in the year of her death.
