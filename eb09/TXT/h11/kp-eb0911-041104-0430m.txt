HAMILTON, the principal town in the western district of Victoria, Australia, is situated on the Grange Burne Creek, in 37° 45' S. lat. and 142° 1' E. long. It was proclaimed a borough in 1859, the area of the municipality being 5280 acres. It has several elegant buildings—a hospital and benevoleut asylum, a town-hall, a treasury and land office, and a public library. Its educational [9:11:412] institutions include the Hamilton and western district college, the academy, and the Alexandra college for ladies, besides a state school with accommodation for 500 pupils. It possesses a fine race-course covering 120 acres, and pastoral and agricultural exhibitions are held annually, the surrounding district being chiefly devoted to sheepfarming. The population of the town and suburbs on the 1st January 1879 was estimated at 4400. The railway from Melbourne to Portland passes through the town.
