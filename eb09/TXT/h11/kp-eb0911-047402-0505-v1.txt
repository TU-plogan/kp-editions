HARDINGE, Henry Hardinge, Viscount (1785- 1856), field-marshal and governor-general of India, was born at WrothaminKent, March 30, 1785. After passing a short time at Eton college, he entered the army in 1798 as an ensign in the Queen’s Rangers, with whom he served in Canada. In the Peninsular War he served for a time on Wellington’s staff, and received an appointment as deputyquarter master-general in the Portuguese army from Marshal Beresford, whose approval and subsequent influence he had won by his gallantry at Corunna in 1809. Hardinge was present at nearly all the battles of the campaign; he was wounded at Vimiera and Vittoria. At Albuera he s ιved the day for the British by taking the responsibility at a critical moment of ordering General Cole’s division to advance. When peace was again broken in 1815 by Napoleon’s escape from Elba, Hardinge hastened into active service, and was appointed to the important post of commissioner at the Prussian headquarters. In this capacity he was present at the battle of Ligny, June 16, 1815, where he lost his left hand by a shot, and thus was not present at Waterloo fought two days later. For the loss of his hind he received a pension of .£300; and in the same year was made a K.C.B. In 1820 and 1826 Sir Henry Hardinge was returned to parliament as member for Durham; and in 1828 he accepted the office of secretary at war in Wellington’s ministry, a post which he also filled in Peel’s cabinet in 1841-43. In 1830 and 1834 he was chief secretary for Ireland. In 1844 he succeeded Lord Ellenborough as governor-general of India, a position which he retained till January 1848. During his term of office the Sikh War broke out; and the governor-general after the battle of Mudki magnanimously offered to serve as second in command under Lord Gough. He manifested all his old courage and skill, and at the peace, for his services in the campaign, he was created Viscount Hardinge of Lahore, and of King’s Newton in Derbyshire, with a Government pension of £3000 for three lives; while the Ea3t India Company voted him an annuity of £5000. He returned to England in 1848, and in 1852 succeeded the duke of Wellington as commander-in-chief of the British army. While in this position he had the home management of the Crimean War, which he endeavoured to conduct on Wellington’s principles—a system not altogether suited to the changed mode of warfare. In 1855 he was promoted to the rank of field-marshal. Viscount Hardinge resigned his office of commander-in-chief in July 1856 owing to failing health, and died on September 24th of the same year at his house near Tunbridge Wells.
