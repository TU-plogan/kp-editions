H

H has varied in form from the Phoenician and old

Hebrew symbol 0, called Che th, only by the removal of the upper and lower horizontal lines. (For the oldest forms of the letter see Alphabet.) The closed form is sometimes found in old Greek inscriptions, and, though less frequently, in South Italy.

Its value in Phoenicia was probably a continuous guttural sound—the sound which it had in Hebrew—resembling the German ch, and with no English counterpart. In Greece it represented nothing more than the spirant h, so long as a separate symbol to denote that sound was felt to be necessary. Afterwards it was generally employed to denote a second e-sound, under the name of Eta ; probably it had before been called Heta. The time of this change varied in different parts of Greece. In the alphabet of the island of Thera we find H representing e as early as the 40th Olympiad, though it still sometimes retained its old value. At Athens the date was 403 b.c., and here the practice did not vary. But in most of the alphabets of Greece proper, of Peloponnesus, and of the Italian colonies, H still remained as the rough breathing; and as such it consequently passed into the Latin alphabet. It is possible that h in a very few Latin words, when it occurs as a medial sound {e.g., traho, veho), was a continuous guttural. But generally it occurs at the beginning of a word, and can hardly have been more than a breathing. Even as this it early became evanescent. During the classical period of Latin literature it was retained in the speech of educated men, doubtless in part by Greek influence. But in the popular speech it was rapidly disappearing as an initial sound; although it continued to be written, and indeed was often written wrongly, at the beginning of words where it had no place; e.g., umor was written humor, and the h has held its own in English spelling down to our day. The sound is almost completely lost in modern Italian.

It is not settled beyond dispute by what mechanism the Λ-sound is produced. The old view (held by Lepsius and others) is that h has a distinct position of its own, further back in the throat than the gutturals, in fact, immediately above the larynx,—that it is a surd, to which the corresponding sonant is the slight gurgle heard between words of which the first ends and the second begins with the same sound (e.g., “go over ”), if we take care to close the glottis between the two words but not to alter the position of the other vocal organs. A quite different view is held by Whitney, M. Bell, and others, that h has no distinct position of its own, but is sounded in or through the position of the following sound; for example, that in saying ha we do not put the vocal organs into two positions, one for h and one for a, but we put them into the position for a, and then produce the breath and the vowel without any change of position, the h being a mere expiration of breath through the open glottis; similarly hi, hu, &c., are produced with the vocal organs in the position for i, u, &c., respectively; in each case the vocal chords vibrate for the vowel after the expiration of breath, but there is no change made within the orifice of the mouth between the Ä-sound and the vowel. This view is at least a plausible one.
