HAZARD, a game played with dice. The player or * l caster” calls a “main” (that is, any number from five to nine inclusive). He then throws with two dice. If he “throws in,” or “nicks,” he wins the sum played for from the banker or “setter.” Five is a nick to five, six and twelve are nicks to six, seven and eleven to seven, eight and twelve to eight, and nine to nine. If the caster “throws out” by throwing aces, or deuce, ace (called crabs), he loses. When the main is five or nine the caster throws out with eleven or twelve; when the main is six or eight he throws out with eleven; when the main is seven he throws out with twelve. If the caster neither nicks nor throws out, the number thrown is his “chance,” and he keeps on throwing till either the chance comes up, when he wins, or till the main comes up, when he loses. When a chance is thrown, the “odds” for or against the chance are laid by the setter to the amount of the original stake.

Suppose, for example, 7 is the main. If the caster throws 7 or 11 he wins; if he throws aces, crabs, or 12 he loses. If he throws any other number, that is his chance. Say 7 is the main and 4 the chance, the odds against the caster are now 2 to 1 (as will appear from the table below). If the stake were £1, the setter would lay £2 to £1 in addition. The caster goes on throwing till either 7 or 4 appears, when he loses £2 or wins £3.

In laying the odds, the setter gains no advantage, as can easily be shown, examining the various ways in which two dice can be thrown.
[table]

in all 36 ways. The table shows that there are six ways in which i can be thrown, three ways in which 4 can be thrown. Hence the odds are 6 to 3, or 2 to 1.

But there is always an advantage in favour of the setter on the stake first played for. The least disadvantageous main for the caster to call is 7.

Take the case in which 7 is the main and £18 (to avoid fractions) the caster’s stake, and £36 therefore the sum played for. Then (1) if 7 or 11 is thrown the caster wins. There are eight ways out of 36 in his favour; therefore his expectation on nicking is - 3 ⅞ths of £18 = £8. (2) If the chance is 6, in order to win he must throw 6

before he throws 7. There are five ways of throwing 6, and six ways of throwing 7. His expectation on 6 is therefore - 5 δ 5 ths of τ 5 τ ths of £36 = £2, 5s. 5⅜d, (3) The expectation on a chance of 8 is the same as on 6, viz., £2, 5s. 5⅛d. (4 and 5) If the chance is 9 or 5 the expectation is √⅛-ths of-Jd of £36 = £1, 12s. (twice). (6 and 7) If the chance is 10 or 4 the expectation is ∕ ff ths of ⅞d of £36 = £1 (twice). The total expectation of the caster is all the separate expectations added together, viz., £17, 14s. lid. If his expectation were equal to the setter’s, it should amount to £18. Therefore the caster’s expectation is 5s. Id. less than it would be if the probabilities of his winning or losing were equal· This makes his disadvantage when 7 is the main equal to 3∣d, and half a farthing in the pound.

The calculations applied to the main of 7 can easily be made use of for any other main, when it will be found that the caster’s expectation of loss when 5 or 9 is the main is 3⅛d. and half a farthing in the pound, and when 6 or 8 is the main 5⅛ch and nearly half a farthing in the pound. '
