HARBOURS AND DOCKS

I. Harbours.

ALL harbours may be classed either as havens for the protection of ships during storms, or as ports suited for commercial purposes. Of the first mentioned class, or those which are called harbours of refuge, some are natural and some artificial.

The designing of harbours constitutes confessedly one of the most difficult branches of civil engineering. In making such a design the engineer, of course, avails himself of the information which is derived from past experience, and endeavours, to the best of his power, to institute a comparison between the given locality and some existing harbour which he supposes to be similarly situated. Perfect identity, however, in the physical peculiarities of different localities seldom if ever exists, and all that can be done in deriving benefit from past experience is to select the harbour which seems most nearly to resemble the proposed work.

In order the better to understand the nature of the difficulties which beset the marine engineer, let us suppose that he is called upon to design works for the accommodation of shipping in a given locality. The questions which immediately press on his attention are—(1) What is the cheapest kind of design that is suitable for the place and sufficient for the class of shipping which has to be accommodated? and (2) What are the smallest sizes of materials and thickness of walls that are admissible in its construction? as on these the cost of the work will materially depend. Before considering how far it is possible to answer such questions, let us endeavour to define the varieties of design into which all sorts of harbours may, with propriety, be resolved.

In the first place they may be all classified under two nain heads—viz., interior works and exterior works.

The interior works are provided for the accommodation and repair of vessels, while the exterior works may be con-eniently enough divided into the following five classes.

1. Harbours of Refuge and Anchorage Breakwaters.— These consist of one or more breakwaters, so arranged as to form a safe roadstead, which shall be easily accessible to the largest vessels in all states of the weather and tide. A breakwater forms a barrier either complete or partial to the progress of the waves, and is intended for sheltering the anchorage ground under its lee. It is not used for commercial traffic as are piers or quays, and therefore a parapet is not necessarily required for preventing the waves from breaking over the top, although this may be useful as a protection against the wind.

2. Deep-water and Tidal Harbours for Commercial Purposes (fig. 1, a, b).— A harbour for commercial purposes is any arrangement of piers or breakwaters, or of both, which encloses and so tranquillizes a sheet of water, that vessels may be moored at the quay walls or wharves which form the inner sides of the piers. Where the coast line lies open to a very heavy sea it is often found necessary to make a double or compound harbour (fig. 1, δ). In such a case the entrance to the inner basin is situated within the sheltered area formed by the outer works.

3. Kanted or Curved Piers (fig. 1, c).—Where there is a single pier of this kind vessels lie under the lee of the kant or kauts, and the sheltered side of the pier is therefore finished as a quay. As the outer end of any such single pier is surrounded by the open sea, it may be convenient to call it a “free end” in contradistinction to the outer end of a close harbour, where the sea room in the fairway is limited to the breadth of the entrance which ought, for sheltering the basin, to be made as narrow as is consistent with the safe passage of vessels. Both extremities of all single insulated breakwaters are of course free ends, as are also the seaward ends of all single breakwaters which are connected with the land.

4. Straight Piers (fig. 1, di).— A straight pier generally projects at right angles to the coast line, with a free end at its seaward extremity; and, unless when the wind blows right in upon the shore, a straight pier will always afford some shelter on its lee side.

5. Quay or Wharf (fig. 1, e).—A quay wall is usually built parallel to the line of shore. It affords no shelter of any kind, and the only advantage which it possesses is that of enabling vessels to load and unload without their having to “beach,” or, where the shores are steep, even to take the ground.

It will be observed that all the kinds of piers or harbours just enumerated differ materially from each other in the amount of shelter which they afford, and are suitable for places having very different degrees of exposure. The first step to be taken, therefore, is to select from the different classes of designs which have been enumerated the one which is best adapted to the physical peculiarities of the situation. The engineer in order to make this selection judiciously must keep in view the essential elements of stability, economy, safety of ingress and egress, and convenient accommodation for the trade of the port. If the place be much exposed, he must therefore arrange the different parts of the work so as to produce a harbour which may be easily taken and left in stormy weather, without endangering the tranquillity of the internal area; for it is the combination of the qualities of an easy and safe entrance and exit, with a good ii loose” and a smooth interior, which alone constitutes a good harbour. Lastly, he must fix the width of the piers and height of the parapets.

The local characteristics which at the outset demand our consideration are—(1) the geological and other physical peculiarities of the shore; (2) the exposure; (3) the force of the waves due to the exposure; (4) the strength, direction, and range of the tides; (5) the depth of the bay or sea in which the harbour is to be built; (6) the proximity of deep water to the works, or in other words, the slope of the foreshore; and (7) the angle at which the heaviest waves impinge on the coast line and on the works.

Before considering some of these questions the reader may refer to figs. 2 and 3, on which are marked the technical names of different parts of harbour works.

Generation of Waves.

Mistakes as to the level of the highest tides are sometimes made by drawing too hasty conclusions from the presence of vegetable life. In the Shetland Islands there may often be seen large blocks of rock (and to these reference will afterwards be made), which during storms have [9:11:456] been driven over the land at heights much greater than that at which vegetation commences and far above the ordinary run of the surf.

The level below the surface of low water at which mud reposes will be found of very considerable value in judging of the exposure of a coast. It may appear unlikely that the disturbance of the surface of the sea occasioned by storms should be propagated to great depths, but there is no want of evidence on this head. Sir G. B. Airy, the astronomerroyal, has shown, on theoretical grounds, that at a depth equal to the length of the wave the motion is - b -⅞ 5 ∙ of that at the surface, and mentions that heavy ground swells break in a depth of 100 fathoms. Sir J. Coode found, from underwater examinations made with the diving dres3, that the shingle of the Chesil Bank was moved during heavy winter storms at a depth of 8 fathoms; and Captain E. K. Calver, R.N., has seen waves 6 or 8 feet high change their colour from the abrasion of the bottom after passing into water of 7 or 8 fathoms. Captain Cialdi maintains that waves may excavate the bottom at a depth of 655 feet in the ocean, of 163 feet in the Mediterranean, and of 132 feet in the English Channel and Adriatic. From these statements it may easily be inferred that in exposed situations mud cannot repose near the surface. Applying such a test to the German Ocean, it is found that in Shetland mud lies in from 80 to 90 fathoms below low water, and its level gradually rises till, on the coast of Holland, it is found at a depth of from 16 to 12 fathoms at the mouth of the Elbe. Now, the violence of the waves upon the shores of the German Ocean certainly corresponds with the rise in the level of the mud, there being a gradual decrease as we come from Shetland and the north of Scotland—where, as will be afterwards shown, wonderful energy is displayed by the sea—to the coasts of Holland, where the waves are much modified. Although it is no doubt true that the flatbottom vessels of the Dutch are built purposely for resisting a heavy surf, still the fact of their being able to take the open beach in nearly all weathers without any protection from harbours proves that the waves are very much reduced before they reach the Dutch coast. Mr Hyde Clarke says —“On the coast of Zealand the Dutch reckoned 8∣ feet as the greatest height to which any wave would be thrown.”

Tn comparing an existing harbour with a proposed one, perhaps the most obvious element is what may be termed the line of maximum exposure, or, in other words, the line of greatest fetch or reach of open sea, and this can be easily measured from a chart. But though possessed of this information, the engineer still does not know in what ratio the height of the waves increases in relation to any given increase in the line of exposure.

In 1852, in the Edinburgh Hew Philosoph. Journal, Mr Thomas Stevenson stated as the result of experimental observation that the heights of the waves were most nearly “in the ratio of the square roots of their distances from the windward shoref or, when h = height of wave in feet, d — distance in miles, and a a coefficient varying with the strength of the wind, then h=α<dd.

The truth of this law has since then been variously tested.^[1. It follows from this law that the heights of embankments of reservoirs above the water surface should, coeteris paribus, be proportional to the square roots of the lengths of water over which the wind acts. ] The accompanying table contains some of the observations made in 1850-52, as well as later observations on the effects of heavy gales which could only be made at long intervals of time :—
[table]

Some of these earlier results have also been laid down in fig. 4, so as to form a storm curve, but since the diagram was made many more observations have been obtained which corroborate the law.

The formula h — 1 ’ 5 λ ∕<7 is represented by the parabolic curve in the diagram, which indicates pretty nearly the height of waves during heavy gales, at least in seas which do not greatly differ in depth from those where the observations were made. This formula is of course inapplicable where the water is not of sufficient depth to allow the [9:11:457] waves to be fully formed, or where it becomes so shallow as to reduce their height after they are formed.

It must be observed that in short fetches, as in narrow lochs or arms of the sea, waves are raised higher during very violent gales than the formula indicates; though it does not appear that such waves go on progressing in height in the same high ratio for any considerable distance.

For short reaches and violent squalls, the formula given in column 5 of the foregoing table will be found more suitable, viz.: —

⅛=1∙5 √ d+(2∙5-√d)

For all ordinary situations the results in the following table will be found sufficient as a general guide.

Table showing approximate Heights of Waves due to lengths of Maximum Fetch by the Formulae.
[table]

The Comte de Marsilli, in 1725, observed waves 14 feet 10 inches in height where the longest possible fetch is 600 miles. At Wick, with much the same exposure, waves of about 40 feet have been seen to strike the breakwater. But the highest which are known to have been accurately measured were by Dr Scoresby in the Atlantic, where they attained the height of 43 feet above the hollow. Cialdi gives observations of others which were from 60 to 108 feet high, but he does not state how the heights were ascertained.

It does not follow, however, that the line of the maximum exposure is in every case the line of maximum effective force of the waves, for this must depend, not only on the length of fetch, but on the angle of incidence of the waves on the walls of the harbour. What may be termed the line of maximum effective exposure is that which, after being corrected for obliquity of impact, produces the maximum result, and this can only be ascertained from the chart by successive trials.

Let as— the greatest force that can assail the pier, h = height of waves which produce (after being corrected for obliquity) the maximum effect, and which are due to the line of maximum effective exposure, α = azimuthal angle formed between the directions of pier and the line of exposure; then, when the force is resolved normal to the line of pier,—

X ocä sin 2 α; but if the force be again resolved in the direction of the waves themselves, the expression becomes x<×h sin 3 α.

It should not, however, be forgotten, in connexion with this subject, that in some cases there are modifying elements to which special attention requires to be given. The waves, for example, when approaching the land obliquely, alter their direction when they get close to the shore, in consequence of the change of depth, and from this cause they approach more nearly at right angles to the general line of the beach, and thus strike with greater force than the line of maximum effective exposure would lead us to expect.

The extraordinary difference between waves which impinge at right angles and others which have even a very slight amount of obliquity has been shown in the most unmistakable manner at the Wick breakwater, where all attempts to make the work stand when exactly at right angles to the waves have hitherto been unsuccessful. It was found by observation that while waves coming from the direction of S. by E. struck the outer part at normal incidence, they struck the landward end of the same kant at an angle of 81°, giving 9° of obliquity. This small measure of relief was found to make a great difference in the impact upon the wall.

The value of the line of effective exposure varies in certain localities with the geographical configuration of the land, a3 in Loch Fyne, where the wind seems to alter its direction with the winding of the loch, so that the effective fetch is greater than the width of free water at the place. On the other hand, where the channel expands, the height of the waves is decreased, as at Craignure in Mull, where the highest wave observed during the winter of 1853-4 was very much less than the formula indicates.

In a case such as représente 1 in fig. 5, the waves which enter the entrance channel or harbour mouth B, though generated apparently in the fetch AB, are largely due to the fetch CB. For the waves generated in the length CA pass round the point A, and are thereafter subject to the impulse of the wind along the line AB. The waves then which enter the harbour mouth, instead of having their point of genesis at A, really take their origin at C, and their height is due to the fetch CB, though reduced by a deflexion round the point A.

Lateral friction is due to the passage of the end of the wave along the face of a vertical wall, while lateral erosion is due to the end of the wave breaking as it passes along the face of long talus walls or sloping beaches.

Force of Waves.

Smeaton, in referring to the propriety of using joggles in the masonry of the Eddystone Lighthouse, says—“When we have to do with and to endeavour to control those [9:11:458] powers of nature that are subject to no calculation, I trust it will be deemed prudent not to omit, in such a case, anything that can without difficulty be applied, and that would be likely to add to the security.” This statement of our greatest marine engineer indicates the propriety of carefully collecting any facts that may help us to a more accurate estimation of those forces which he regarded as being “subject to no calculation.”

At the Bishop Rock lighthouse, a bell was broken from its attachments at the level of 100 feet above the high water mark during a gale in the winter of 1860, and at Unst, the most northern of the Shetland Islands, a door was broken open at a height of 195 feet above the sea. To these facts"it may be added that, as proved by the testimony of an eye-witness, a block of 50 tons was moved by the sea at Barrahead, one of the Hebrides. But still more extraordinary effects have been observed at Whalsey in Shetland, where heavy blocks have been quarried, or broken out of their beds in situ, on the top of the Bound Skerry at a great elevation above the sea. On thé south-east side, about 370 feet from the low water mark, and at a height of 62⅛ feet above its level, there occurs a remarkable beach of angular blocks varying in size from 9⅜ tons downwards, which are huddled together just as one would have expected to find, had they been elevated only a few feet above the high water level. Towards the north-east at the lffvel of 72 feet above the sea, in addition to many smaller blocks which had evidently been recently detached, there was one 5⅛ tons in weight. It presented the appearance of recent detachment, having a fresh unweathered look. Within 20 feet of the spot where it lay, there was a comparatively recently formed void in the rock, which upon examination and comparison by measurement was found to suit exactly the detached block. Here then was a phenomenon so remarkable as almost to stagger belief--a mass of 5⅛ tons not only moved but actually quarried from its position in situ at a level of 72 feet above high water spring tides; and higher up still there was another detached rock weighing no less than 13⅜ tons tilted up in a peculiar position, and underneath which numerous angular masses had been wedged, obviously by aqueous action.

But by far the most striking effects as yet recorded were at the harbour works of Wick, which were commenced in 1863, and consisted of blocks of from 5 to 10 tons set on edge, first built above high water neap tides with hydraulic lime, then with Roman and latterly with Portland cement. In October 1864, 300 feet of the contractor’s staging were carried away; and greenheart were afterwards substituted for Memel piles, but these too were broken by the sea. The first portion of the wall was, in conformity with usual practice, founded at 12 feet below low water, but 18 feet was subsequently adopted, and the nibble has since been washed down to 15 feet below that· level. In 1872 a huge monolithic block of concrete, weighing in all 1350 tons, was removed en masse out of its position and carried to leeward of the breakwater. Extraordinary as this may appear, it was surpassed in 1873, when another concrete mass which had been substituted for the one that was moved, was in like manner carried away, though it contained 1500 cubic yards of cement rubble, the weight of which was about 2600 tons.

The marine dynamometer was constructed by Mr T. Stevenson for the purpose of ascertaining the force of the waves against an obstacle. DEFD (fig. 6) is a cast-iron cylinder, which is firmly bolted at the projecting flanges G to the rock where the experiments are to be made. This cylinder has a circular flange at D. Lis a door which is opened when the observation is to be read off. A is a circular disk on whieh the waves impinge. Fastened to the disc are four guide rods B, which pass through a circular plate C (which is screwed down to the flange D), and also through holes in the bottom of the cylinder EF. Within the cylinder there is attached to the plate C a very strong steel spring, to the other or free end of which is fastened the small circular plate K, which again is secured to the guide rods B. There are also rings of leather T, which slide on the guide rods, and serve as indices for registering how far the rods have been pushed through the holes in the bottom EF, or, in other words, how far the spring has been drawn out by the action of the waves against the disk A. These disks were from 6 to 9 inches in diameter.

The greatest result obtained by the dynamometer at Skerryvore Lighthouse, in the Atlantic, was during the heavy westerly gale of 29th March 1845, when there was registered a force equivalent to 6083 lb, or nearly 3 tons, per square foot, deduced from the area exposed. The next highest was 5323 lb. In the German Ocean the greatest result obtained at the Bell Rock was 3013 lb per square foot. But subsequent and much more extended observations at Dunbar, in the county of East Lothian, gave 3⅜ tons; while at the harbour works of Buckie, on the coast of Banffshire, the highest result of observations, extending over a period of several years, was 3 tons per square foot.

Mr David Stevenson, when referring, in 1835, to the lakes in North America, pointed out that the general depth of water must, in order to allow the waves to be fully formed, be considerable, and that the sea must be unobstructed by shoals, and also of sufficient area to admit of the wind acting fully on the water.

If in front of a harbour shoal water extends seawards for a considerable distance so as to form an extensive flat foreshore, the depth of water above it becomes the true limit of the maximum wave, whatever may be the general depth of the sea outside. But at Arbroath harbour and at Alne mouth, the heaviest waves are tripped up by the shoal water near the mouths of the harbours, and are not found so dangerous to the works inside as the smaller waves which reach the beach in an unbroken state.

Mr Scott Russell states that waves break when they come into water of the same depth as their height. At Wick, however, the height of the waves above the mean level was about two-thirds of their height. In 1870, at Scarborough, it was found that waves of from 5 to 6∣ feet broke when the depth was 10 feet 3 inches below their troughs, and 6 feet waves broke in water 13 feet 8 inches deep, which would for waves of this class give Λ = ∣<7, where d is depth below mean level, and h the height from hollow to crest.

The late Dr Macquorn Rankine has shown that, theoretically, the mean water level is not situated half way between the crest and trough of the sea. The following formulae furnished by him give the mean level of the sea from the height and length of the wave. These formulae are exact only for water of considerable depth as compared with the length of the wave. For shallower water they are only approximate :—

Let L be the length of a wave, H the height from trough to crest; then, diameter of rolling circle, radius of orbit of particle = ⅛H, and elevation of middle level of wave above still 3∙1416H 2 .- 70 r 2 H 2 water = -= = ‘7854— .

Consequently—

Trough below still water =— - '7854—- .

2 Ju Deep-Water Harbours.

Harbours of refuge are distinguished from tidal harbours mainly by the superior depth of water which they possess and the larger area which they enclose. The requisites are—shelter during storms, good holding ground, and easy access for shipping at any time of tide and in all states of the weather A breakwater, though a passive, is yet a real agent, having true work to do. During storms many thousand tons of water are elevated and maintained above [9:11:459] the sea-level; and a breakwater has to stop their onward motion within a given space or else to change the direction of their movement. There are two ways in which this work can be performed. One is by means of a plumb wall to alter the direction of the moving water by causing it to ascend vertically, and then to allow it to descend vertically, by which process the waves are reflected and sent back seawards. Another mode is to arrest the undulations by a sloping wall of length sufficient to allow the mass of elevated water to fall down upon the slope. If, however, the slope is not long enough to enable the waveβ to destroy themselves, they will, though reduced in height, pursue their original direction and pass over the top of the breakwater. In this case the breakwater does not do its full amount of work, and imperfect shelter is obtained.

The principle asserted in favour of the vertical wall is that oceanic waves in deep water are purely oscillatory, and exert no impact against vertical barriers, which are therefore the most eligible, as they have only to encounter the hydrostatic pressure due to the height of the impinging billows which are reflected without breaking.

From the effect of winds and tide-currents already referred to, and perhaps from other causes, the action of which seems to have been overlooked by the advocates of the upright wall, we have good reason for believing that any form of barrier, in whatever depth of water it may be placed, must occasionally be subjected to heavy impact. The possibility of waves of translation being generated in the deepest water is. established by the following facts :— first, that oceanic waves break, partially at least, long before they reach the shore, because (as admitted by the advocates of the purely oscillatory character of oceanic undulations) the depth of water is too small to admit of their being fully propagated; secondly, that waves in strong tideways break in deep water during calm weather—a phenomenon which is apparent to the eye and familiar to all sailors; thirdly, and negatively, that to leeward of those races which produce broken water, and which certainly do not reflect the incoming waves, there is comparatively smooth water both at sea and on the adjoining shore until the strength of the tide is exhausted and the race has disappeared, after which violent action is again fully manifested on the shore. Even a vertical wall, if built of ordinary masonry in courses, must during its formation present to the action of the waves at its unfinished end a sloping or at least a stepped face like a talus wall, but which, unfortunately for its stability, possesses none of the advantages of such a finished work. In short, during the most critical period of the history of every built vertical wall, the face work and hearting are exposed, at the outer end, to the force of breaking waves. At Dunbar the force against the unfinished end of a nearly vertical wall was found by the marine dynamometer to be nearly six times greater than on the face of the finished wall, where the waves were at the time purely oscillatory.

An important advantage of the sloping wall is the small resistance which it offers to the impinging wave, but it should also be borne in mind that the weight resting on the face-stones in a talus wall is decreased in proportion to the sine of the angle of the slope. If we suppose the waves which assail a sloping wall to act in the horizontal plane, the component of their impulsive force at right angles to the surface of the talus will be proportional to the sine of the angle of inclination to the plane, while the effective force estimated in the horizontal plane will be proportional to the square of the sine of the angle of inclination. But if we assume the motion of the impinging particles to be horizontal, the number of them which will be intercepted by the sloping surface will be also reduced in the ratio of the sine of the angle of inclination, or of the inclination of the wall to the vertical. Hence the tendency of the waves to produce horizontal displacement, on the assumption that the direction of the impinging particles is horizontal, will be pro portional to the cube of the sine of the angle of elevation of the wall.

If it further happens that, owing to the relative direction of the pier and of the waves, there is an oblique action in azimuth as well as in altitude, there will be another similar reduction in the ratio of the squares or cubes of the angle of incidence, according as the component of the force is reckoned at right angles to the surface of the pier or in the direction of the waves.

Let ∕= force of the wave on unit of surface of wall for perpendicular incidence; f'≈ force on unit of surface at vertical incidence <ρ and azimuthal incidence ψ; then f' <×f (sin φ sin ψ) 3 . ,

The amount of shelter which is produced by a breakwater must be measured by the length of the portion of wave which is either destroyed or reflected by it. The amount of work done by it decreases from the maximum, which is at normal incidence, to zero when the waves come upon it “end on,” in which last case it ceases to act as a breakwater at all, unless to the extent due to lateral friction or erosion where there is a wall or a slope on which the end of the waves can break.

If a breakwater be so situated in relation to the coast line that waves may strike obliquely upon its inner or sheltered side, an extension of its length in the same direction will increase the amount of sea intercepted by it. The lengthening of a breakwater may therefore, during certain winds, increase the sea within the harbour instead of reducing it. In such a case the extension should, if possible, be made in a different direction, or a separate breakwater may be brought from the shore so as to shelter the inner side. If these works cannot be undertaken, then an addition to the sheltered space within must be provided in which the waves can spread, or additional slopes be provided on which they can break.

The table of the principal proportions of some of the most remarkable breakwaters given on p. 460 may be found useful as a guide in designing works of a similar kind.

The following costs of different breakwaters are from the minutes of the Institution of Civil Engineers and other sources :—
[table]

Although some of these prices have given rise to lengthened discussions as to the comparative economic advantages of the various designs, the results have not been of much value, on account of the different degrees of exposure and of depth of water at the various places. The economic values may perhaps be arrived at in a more satisfactory manner, although still but only very approximately, thus:—When x = the price per foot of depth, ∕> = the [9:11:460] Table of principal Proportions of remarkable Breakwaters.
[table]

price per lineal foot, and cf = the depth in feet at high water, then T x ~ d *

The results calculated in this manner are arranged in order of their costs in the following table, from which the plumb pier at Dover appears to be by far the most costly:—
[table]

Minard allows for large merchant vessels in harbours of refuge one cable-length, which would give about four vessels per acre. Captain Calver allows three vessels per acre for a small sheltered harbour of refuge. At Cardiff Flats there were at one time 224 vessels anchored as close to each other as they could well be, in an open roadstead, and occupying a space of 560 acres, which would give 0 ’ 4 vessel per acre.

Tidal Harbours.

We have hitherto been considering outer breakwaters erected in deep water, and which are constantly exposed to the waves; we now turn to piers and sea-walls which are placed within the range of the breaking surf, and which are exposed to its force for a limited period only, being sometimes left nearly or altogether dry by the receding tide.

In dealing with waves which are admitted by all to exert a true percussive force, the question arises as to how this force may be best resisted—whether by opposing to it dead weight, or a comparatively light structure, the stability of which is dependent on strong fixtures connecting it with the bottom. On this subject the late Mr Alan Stevenson made the following remarks, in relation to lighthouse towers, but his views are equally applicable to piers and breakwaters :—

‘ ‘ A primary inquiry in regard to towers in an exposed situation is the question whether their stability should depend upon their strength or their weight, or, in other words, on their cohesion or their t'nerti*α? In preferring weight to strength we more closely follow the course pointed out by the analogy of nature, and this must not be regarded as a mere notional advantage, for the more close the analogy between nature and our works the less difficulty we shall experience in passing from nature to art, and the more directly will our observations on natural phenomena bear upon the artificial project. If, for example, we make a series of observations on the force of the sea as exerted on masses of rock, and endeavour to draw from these observations some conclusions as to the amount and direction of that force as exhibited by the masses of rock which resist it successfully, and the form which these masses assume, we shall pass naturally to the determination of the mass and form of a building which maybe capable of opposing similar forces, as we conclude with some reason that the mass and form of the natural rock are exponents of the amount and direction of the forces they have so long continued to resist. It will readily be perceived that we are in a very different and less advantageous position, when we attempt, from such observations of natural phenomena in which weight is solely concerned, to deduce the strength of an artificial fabric. Another very obvious reason why we should prefer mass and weight to strength as a source of stability is that the effect of mere inertia is constant and unchangeable in its nature, while the strength which results even from the most judiciously disposed and well-executed fixtures of a comparatively light fabric is constantly subject to be impaired by the loosening of such fixtures, occasioned by the almost incessant tremor to which structures of this kind must be subject from the beating of the waves. Mass therefore seems to be a source of stability, the effect of which is at once apprehended by the mind as more in harmony with the conservative principles of nature, and unquestionably less liable to be deteriorated, than the strength which depends upon the careful proportion and adjustment of parts.”^[4. Account of the Skerryυ∩re Lighthouse, by Alan Stevenson, LL.B., F.R.S.E., Edin., 1848, p. 49. ]

It is a remarkable fact that during a summer gale 14 blocks, each 2 tons in weight, which had been permanently fixed in the Dhu Heartach lighthouse tower by joggles and cement, at the level of 35^ feet above the sea, were torn out and swept off the rock, while the thin panes of crown glass in the lantern of Winstanley’s Eddystone tower, which were only about 5 feet higher, resisted the waves for a whole winter. The impact on marine masonry seems [9:11:461] therefore to depend on the relation subsisting between the height of the waves at the place and the height and configuration of the rock itself above and below low water, and perhaps also on the configuration of the bottom of the sea near the rock.^[5. Mi D. A. Stevenson has lately shown that a funnel-shaped depression in the sea-bottom extends from the ocean in the direction of, and nearly as far as, the Dhu Heartach rock, a geological formation which must certainly admit the heaviest class of waves to come nearer to the rock (3/ïn. of Proc, of the Inst, of Civil Engineers, vol. κlvi.). ] While the rock at Dhu Heartach from its height above the sea forms a protection against the smaller waves, it operates as a dangerous conductor to the larger waves, enabling them to exert a powerful action at a much higher level than if the rock had been lower. It is of great importance that these facts should be kept in view, and that the Eddystone should not be regarded as a safe model for imitation at all rocks which are exposed to a heavy sea.

The impact of the waves against the outside of a sea wall or pier gives rise to four distinct forces, namely—(1) the direct horizontal force, which tends to shake loose, or drive in, the blocks of which the masonry consists; (2) the vertical force acting upwards on any projecting stone or protuberance, as well as against the lying beds of the stones; (3) the vertical force acting downwards, which results either from the receding wave striking upon the toe of a talus wall, or from its passing over the parapet and falling upon the pitching behind, so as to plough it up; (4) the “backdraught,” which tends by reaction from the wall to remove the soft bottom, and in this way to undermine the lower courses or to suck loose stones out of the work.

It may be concluded from the above that the points which require to be most attended to are—the contour and quality of masonry of the wall itself; the parapet, which if not of proper form, or of insufficient height, leads to damage in the pitching behind it; and lastly, the foundationcourses, in the design and construction of which, if similar precautions be not attended to, underwashing of the bottom may take place, so as to leave the lowest courses without protection.

Within the masonry, as well as without, the waves exert force in the following different ways :—(1) by the propagation of vibrations produced by the shock of the waves on the outer or sea-wall, through the body of the pier to the inner or quay-wall; (2) by the direct communication of the impulses through the particles of the fluid occupying the interstices of the hearting, so as to act against the back joints of the face stones of the inner quay; (3) by the sudden condensations and expansions of the air in the hearting, so as to loosen, and at last to blow out, the face stones of the quay; combined with (4) the hydrostatic pressure of the water, which is forced through the sea-wall, and, from want of free exit, is retained and acts as a head at the back of the quay, and which, however small in quantity, will, as in a Bramah press, act with equal force upon all surfaces exposed to its pressure, however large those surfaces may be. The last three causes are probably the most efficient agents in the work of destruction.

From a comparison of different piers in the German Ocean where we have most examples, and from careful consideration of the other data, it appears that vertical piers, fully exposed to the ordinary waves of that sea, should be not less than from 35 to 45 feet broad at the level of high water. Of course this remark does not apply to anomalous cases where waves are exceptionally high, but, as already stated, to works exposed to the ordinary waves.

The positions in which the piers are to be placed depend on the nature and configuration of the shore and of the bottom. After a correct plan, with soundings, has been obtained, the next step is to lay down contour lines of the different depths which make the limits of the deep and shoal water at once obvious to the eye. The lines of the piers may then be sketched so as, without disregarding other conditions, to keep the works as much as possible on the shoal ground, while they at the same time enclose the greatest possible area of deep water.

The entrance should be fixed seaward of every part of the works; and its direction, unless where the internal area is small and the sea very heavy, should if possible be made to coincide with that of the heaviest waves, so that they may run along with and guide vessels into the harbour.

The outer pier should in such a case be extended sufficiently far seaward of the end of the inner pier head to give it a free end, as in fig. 7, thus allowing a ship plenty of sea room to shape an easy course before taking the entrance to the sheltered basin of the harbour.

There should be sufficient distance landward of a harbour mouth to allow a vessel, having full weigh on her, to shorten sail. For this Minard recommends that, where vessels of ordinary size require to alter their course in order to reach the inner basin, no circle with a less radius than 200 yards in smooth water should, if possible, be adopted, and it should not be forgotten that a vessel requires a larger radius in turning where the water is shoal than where it is deep.

If the beach consist of travelling detritus, the entrance must be so devised as not to form a trap for the passing shingle. This danger is most to be dreaded on the coasts where heavy waves strike obliquely upon the shore. Finally, there must be a good “loose,” so that vessels on leaving the harbour shall be able to shape their course free of rocks or a lee-shore; and Minard very properly remarks that the mouths of harbours should be designed rather to suit the entering, which is far more important, than the exit of vessels.

Preference should generally be given to a pier of horizontal convex outline, or a polygonal form, than to one long straight pier. The principal objection to a straight pier does not, however, extend to cases where the heaviest waves strike upon it obliquely, and roll landwards along the sea-wall. Especial care, however, must in all cases be taken that a sea-work nowhere presents to the sea a surface of concave horizontal outline, or, what is still worse, abrupt faces which form a re-entrant angle; for the waves will then act with an almost explosive violence, the breaking of a free wave being a very different thing from the breaking of a wave confined by a barrier of masonry. While the first may be compared to the harmless ignition of a loose heap of gunpowder, the other resembles the dangerous explosion produced by the discharge of a cannon.
[9:11:462]

It may in some cases be found better, in designing a seawall for protecting a sinuous coast, to carry the bulwark straight across ledges of rock which extend landwards, than to follow the line of the high water margin. For although with the straight wall we may have to encounter a greater depth of water and a heavier surf, still with the other we may have to oppose the waves with a wall which has at some places a concave horizontal curvature, by which the force is concentrated and rendered more destructive. Moreover, the straight wall may be considerably shorter than the curved.

The general gradient of a fragmentary beach depends upon the size and nature of the particles, and the force of the sea. The dissimilarity between its slopes near the levels of high and low water arises from a decrease in the force of the waves, caused by their being broken before they reach the high water mark. The great object, therefore, is to design the profile of the wall so as to alter as little as possible the symmetry of the beach. For the reasons already stated, it is plain that unless near high water mark a vertical wall is in most cases unsuitable for a sandy beach. Instead of altering the direction of the wave at a distance from its foundation, the whole change is produced at that very point; and, unless the wall bo founded at a considerable depth, its destruction is all but certain. A curved profile will prevent to a considerable extent the danger of reaction, by causing the alteration in the direction of the wave to take place at that part where the wall is strongest, and which is also at the greatest possible distance from the toe or curb course. But a very serious objection to all forms of curved walls, unless the radius be large, is the weakness which results from the use of wedge-shaped face-stones. The impact of the sea on materials of that form may be compared to a blow directed upwards against the intrados of a stone arch—the direction of all others in which the voussoirs are most easily dislocated. This action can only be resisted by very careful workmanship in the dressing and setting of the backing. Another objection, applicable to all except tideless seas, such as the Mediterranean, arises from the varying level of the surface of the water; for what may be best at one time of the tide cannot be equally suitable at another.

When a wave encounters an obstacle such as a breakwater, the portion which strikes it is either entirely destroyed or reflected seawards; while the portion which is not so intercepted passes onwards, and spreading laterally under lee of the barrier suffers a reduction of its height. From a very few observations in the sea under lee of the breakwater at Wick, and from some experiments made in a brewer’s cooling vat by Mr Thomas Stevenson, it appeared that after passing an obstruction the reduction in the height of a wave varies as the square root of the angle of deflexion. When x represents the ratio of the reduced to the unreduced wave and α the angle of deflexion, the formula, which must however, be regarded as only approximate, is x=l ’ 00- ∙06√~

The measurements of the distances of high water mark from the centre of divergence, in sandy bays which are under lee of promontories, 8eem to show that this formula, or one for a logarithmic spiral, represents the effect of lateral divergence very fairly. Providing the materials of the beach are homogeneous and easily moved, the incursions of the waves into the land will be measures of the forces, all of which become nil at the high water mark. The following table show8 measurements of the finely curved storm and tide marks traced out on the sandy beach under the lee of the promontory at North Berwick, and the results of the formula.
[table]

The tranquillity of close harbours with the same exposure depends on the relative widths of the entrance and the interior, the depth of water, and the form and direction of the entrance in relation to the line of maximum exposure. A formula for the reductive power of harbours has been given by Mr Thomas Stevenson (Edin. Phil. Journal for 1853).

Where the piers are high enough to protect the enclosed area from the wind, and the width of entrance not veιy great in comparison with the breadth of the wave, the quay walls nearly vertical, and the distance from the entrance to place of observation not less than 50 feet, then·

x =H— _ 1 ( II + H≤l) √D ,

√B 50 ∖ √B∕ ’

where II - height of wave at entrance, b — breadth of entrance, B =∙ breadth of harbour at place of observation, D = distance from mouth of harbour to place of observation, x≈ height of reduced or residual wave at place of observation,—all in feet. If H be taken as unity, x will be a fraction representing the reductive power of the harbour.

Actual measurements at the harbours of Kingstown, Sunderland, Macduff, Fisherrow, and Buckie gave the mean of observations (which at Buckie alone numbered upwards of 2000) = 2 - 64 feet, while that of results calculated by the formula gave 2’62 feet.

The size as well as the ratio of widths of entrance and basin must also bear a proper relation to the height of waves to which the harbour is exposed. The formula for the reductive power assumes that the waves after being reduced by lateral expansion shall have time to sink and be ultimately destroyed. But if instead of this they are again reflected towards the entrance, such recoil will destroy the tranquillity of the basin and prevent vessels from answering their helm when taking the entrance. Also where a spending beach which is only partially effective in destroying the waves is formed very near the entrance, it may do little or no good by causing a back wash or recoil wave which will injuriously affect vessels when entering.

As before mentioned, it is essential when the exposure is great that there be either a considerable internal area, or else a separate basin opposite the entrance to the inner basin, for the waves to destroy or spend themselves. Such a basin should, if possible, enclose a portion of the original shore for the waves to break upon, and when circumstances preclude this there should be a flat talus wall of at least 3 or 4 to 1, as recommended by the late Mr Bremner of Wick. Mr Scott Russell has found that talus walls of 1 to 1, or steeper, will not allow the waves to break fully, but will reflect them in such a manner as might in some cases make the entrance difficult or even dangerous of access, and the berthage within unsafe.

The following cases in which traffic has been successfully carried on at quays unprotected by covering piers, may be found useful as a guide :—

At Scrabster the quay is at right angles to a fetch of 6 miles. At Invergordon there is a fetch of 5 miles; at Burntisland, 6; Kilcreggan, 4; Londonderry, 1⅜; Greenock, 6|; Albert Quay, Greenock, 7 miles. The last two are, however, somewhat sheltered by the low-water banks near Greenock.

Five miles is probably not far from the limit that should be observed, which by the ordinary formula, A=1'5√D, gives a wave of [9:11:463] 3 ’ 8 feet; but the formula for distances so short as these would give waves about a foot higher, and in heavy storms perhaps waves not much less than 5 feet may exist, but on such occasions vessels could not safely use the quay.

In order to tranquillize harbours of small reductive power, logs of timber called booms, having their ends secured by projecting into grooves cut in the masonry on each side, are placed across the entrance of the inner basin or dock. From 15 to 25 logs are usually dropped into those grooves, or as many more as will insure close contact of the lowest log with a sill-piece placed in the bottom of the harbour. They are also warped down or fixed with an iron hasp at the coping course, without which precaution the swell is found to enter the harbour from underneath. By this contrivance, which forms a temporary wall, the waves are checked, and completely prevented from spreading into the interior basin.

Twelve-inch booms of pine timber about 33 feet long have been broken at the small fishing village of Mousehole, near Penzance, and elm logs have in consequence been substituted. At Hynish in Argyllshire, booms of the same timber and scantling and 20 feet long have been very frequently broken. The marine dynamometer at this place gave 1⅜ ton per square foot.

The capacity of commercial harbours for trade varies so much with the exposure and size of vessels, that it is difficult to approximate to the truth. At Ramsgate, for instance, there were found to be about 6 vessels to an acre in the outer harbour, while there were about 14 in the inner and better protected basin, where too there was perhaps a greater proportion of small vessels. In the Scotch fishing harbours the number of boats used to be reckoned at from 85 to 115 per acre; but of late their size has been much increased, and probably not more than from 80 to 90 could be accommodated. The Cornish boats at New Lynn, according to the Channel pilot, vary from 60 to 80 per acre.

The employment of timber in harbour works is of great antiquity. It seems first to have been used in forming boxes which were filled with stones, and at a more recent period in the formation of open frameworks through which the current could pass freely. Vitruvius mentions moles, consisting of timber filled with stones and cement, as having been used by the harbour-builders in his days.^[6. It was probably to some such work that Horace refers in Ode 1, Book iii. :— “Contracta pisces aequora sentiunt, Jactis in altum molibus; huc frequens Caementa dimittit redemptor.” A harbour contract dated 1394, in all probability the earliest which has been preserved, appears in the Regisirurn Nigrum de Aberbrοthοc— a collection of ancient documents printed by the Bannatyne Club, and edited by the late Professor Cosmo Innes. ] The earliest drawing of timber piers that we have met with is that of the ancient port of Dunkirk in 1699, a cross section of which from Belidor’s Architecture Hydraulique is given in Plate VIII., fig. 4. This kind of structure is still not uncommon on the coasts of the English Channel.

In sheltered bays where a deep-water landing-place is all that is required, and where the bottom is sandy or soft, timber may be employed with great advantage. Even in somewhat exposed situations it can also be used for tidal harbours; but the fatal evil in places where there is no admixture of fresh water is its rapid destruction by marine insects. In the Atlantic Ocean the Teredo navαlis, and at many places in the German Ocean the Limnoria terebrans, which was first discovered by the late Mr Robert Stevenson at the Bell Rock Lighthouse in 1810, are very destructive of most kinds of timber. Mr Stevenson found that memel was destroyed by the Limnoria at the rate of about 1 inch inwards per annum. He found that greenheart, beefwood, African oak, and bullet tree were scarcely attacked, while teak stood remarkably well and locust tolerably well, though suffering at last. Greenheart timber, though not absolutely impenetrable, as appears from Mr Stevenson’s experiments, is the great specific in seas where the worms are destructive. But subsequent experience has proved that on the coasts of Scotland it is, in some cases, readily attacked, and at these places creosoting is of comparatively little use, as the worm manifests no repugnance to timber which has been even very recently impregnated.

In addition to the experiments on timber, twenty-five different kinds and combinations of iron were tried at the Bell Rock, including specimens of galvanized irons. All the ungalvanized irons were found to oxidize with much the same readiness. The galvanized specimens resisted oxidation for three or four years, after which the chemical action went on as quickly as in the others. Although the association of zinc with iron protects, so long as it lasts, the metal with which it is in contact, it must be remembered that this immunity is obtained at the expense of the zinc, the tendency of which to oxidization is proportionally exalted so soon as any part of the iron is exposed.

The important experiments of Mr Mallet on specimens sunk in the sea showed that the amount of corrosion decreased with the thickness of the casting, and that from τ ⅛th to ⅛th inch in depth, in castings 1 inch thick, and about 1 ⅛th inch of wrought iron will be destroyed in a century in clear salt water. But there is reason to believe from a cannon ball which was picked up on the shores of the island of Inchkeith that the decay was in that case ∣th inch to the century. Cast-iron gratings periodically immersed by the tide at the Bell Rock lost at the rate of 1 inch in a century. Even when the castings were externally sound their strength was reduced one-half in about 50 years.

In judging of the qualities of different quarries for harbour purposes the importance of a high specific gravity ought not to be overlooked, as appears from the table given on page 464.

The superiority of granite to greenstone is proved by the following experiments on the times required to abrade τ ⅛th inch of each kind of stone, made with the same weights and grinding agents, and with equal cubes of each material :—30 minutes were required for Queensferry (Carlin Nose) greenstone; 40 minutes for greenstone from Barnton near Edinburgh; 60 minutes for Peterhead granite. Mr Murray of Sunderland also established, many years ago, the superior power of resistance to attrition possessed by granite over greenstone.

Portland cement rubble and concrete, a most valuable material, now very commonly used in Britain as well as on the Continent, may be said to have to a large extent revolutionized harbour building; for it admits of being employed in many different ways, and can, if due care be taken as to the quality of the cement and purity of the sand and gravel, be used with perfect confidence.

The following specification has been followed extensively at different places :—

The Portland cement is to be obtained from the best manufacturers. It is to be ground extremely fine, and is to weigh not less than 115 lb per bushel; and each cargo will, on its arrival at the works, be tested in the following manner. The cement is to be made into small blocks 1 inch square and 8 inches long. After being made, these blocks are to be immersed in water for 7 days and then tested by being placed on two supports 6 inches apart, when they must stand the transverse strain produced by a weight of 70 lb placed in the centre. Slabs or cakes are also to be made and placed in water, and after immersion for 24 hours they are not to show any signs of cracking or any softness on the surface.

The cement is to be tested before any of it is used, and if it be found unsatisfactory it must be removed from the works. When a cargo is landed it must be tested from four different bags, and it must also be tested weekly as the works proceed, and the results forwarded to the engineers. The cement must be brought direct [9:11:464] Table of Properties of different kinds of Rocks.
[table]

Note. —This table is calculated for sea water of the specific gravity of Γ028 or 64⅛ lb to the cubic foot.

from the manufactory and kept at the works in a dry and well-ventilated storehouse with dry wooden floor and side walls, properly roofed in and completely protected from the weather.

The concrete to he used is to consist of one part of Portland cement, two of sand, and five of gravel, to be thoroughly mixed with a proper quantity of pure water; after it is deposited, large angular stones are to be added, care being taken that all the stones are completely surrounded by concrete for a thickness of not less than 4 inches. All stones to be clean and quite free from sea-weed or other vegetable matter likely to prevent the adhesion of the concrete. No concrete to be made during frost. The sand and gravel used must be sharp and clean, being perfectly free from clay or earthy matter.

There are different kinds of machines by which the concrete is thoroughly mixed, and a saving of cost effected. In that of Mr Messent the number of revolutions to mix the concrete thoroughly is twelve.

The walls of harbours may be constructed of continuous building of concrete and stones, protected by temporary piling and close planking. The best mode of keeping out the water, as adopted by Mr Balmer at the duke of Richmond’s harbour of Port Gordon, is to make a saw-draft in each plank, and to place a thin plate of iron between the planks. An example of this continuous or monolithic, building is shown in Plate VIIL, fig. 6.

Mr B. B. Stoney has deposited at Dublin the largest blocks that have as yet been attempted to be moved.

Each block is 27 feet high, 21 feet 4 inches wide at base, and 12 feet long in the direction of wall, contains nearly 5000 cubic feet, and weighs 350 tons; and when laid in place 12 lineal feet of the wall is finished at once up to ordinary low water level. No cofferdam, staging, or pumping is required. The superstructure is built in the ordinary method by tide work, and is faced with granite ashlars for the ships to lie against. The blocks are built on land, and after 10 weeks’ drying are lifted by floating shears, the barge or pontoon of which is ISO feet long and 48 feet wide, and of this 130 feet 30 form a tank at the aft end; and, when filled with water, this balances the weight of the block hanging from the shears at the other end. A block can be raised with the flood tide, and is generally set the following low water.

The late Mr J. M. Rendel introduced the improved and very valuable method of depositing the pierres perdues or rubble, which is now generally used in the construction of large breakwaters. This method he employed first at Millbay pier, near Plymouth, in 1838, in a depth of 38 feet, and afterwards, on a still larger scale, in the construction of the breakwaters at Holyhead and Portland.

The improvement consists in depositing the rough materials from stagings of timber, elevated a considerable height above high water. The stones are brought on the staging in waggons, through the bottoms of which they are discharged into the sea. The principle on which these stagings are designed is that of offering the smallest possible resistance to the sea, the under structure consisting of nothing more than single upright piles for supporting each roadway. .At Wick harbour works, as already stated, it was found that the piles of the staging for depositing the rabble required to be of greenheart timber; but even these were broken in large numbers. The piles were invariably broken by the waves at about the level of high water.

A depth of from 12 to 15 feet under low water was pointed out by Mr Rendel as the level below which the waves did little or no damage to pierres perdues. Sir John Rennie indeed considered that there was little or no effect at a fathom and a half. But at Wick, as already stated, the rûbble was moved as low as 15 feet, and at Alderney 20 feet.

If the beds of the stones in a sea-wall were polished, the power of resistance would be reduced by about one-fourth, or in other words, roughly dressed materials of three-fourths the weight of polished materials will be equally safe.
[9:11:465]

There is also good reason to believe that slopes of large pierres perdues are preferable to slopes of dressed masonry. The great object to be attained is the maximum amount and uniform distribution of friction.

Piers of cast and of malleable iron are now frequently employed. Examples of these may be seen at Scarborough, Southport, Portobello, and at many other parts of the English coast, and have been found to answer even where there is a considerable sea.

The pier at Southport, described^[7. Min. Inst. Civ. Eng. , vol. xx. ] by Mr H. Hooper, is of cast iron, and the mode of sinking the piles was peculiar. The piles proper or lowest lengths of the columns are cast in lengths of 8 feet and 10 feet, and are sunk into the sand to the depth of 7 feet and 9 feet respectively. They were provided with circular disks 1 foot 6 inches in diameter, to form a bearing surface; and, a small hole being left in the centre, a wrought-iron tube 2 inches in diameter was passed down the inside of the pile, and forced about four inches into the sand, a connexion being made by means of a flexible hose between the top of the tube and a temporary pipe connected with the Water Company’s mains, and extended as the sinking of the piles proceeded. A pressure of water of about 50 lb per inch was thus obtained, and this was found to be sufficient to force the sand from under the disk. Each disk was provided on the lower side with cutters, which, on an alternating motion being given to the pile, loosened the sand. The piles were gradually lowered, and guided by a small ordinary piling engine. When the pressure of water had been removed about 5 minutes, the piles settled down to so firm a bearing that when tested with a load of 12 tons each no signs of settlement could be perceived. The cast-iron columns are 7 inches in external and 5f inches in internal diameter. All the piles, to the number of 237, were sunk in six weeks, being at the rate of between 6 and 7 in twenty-four hours.

The Clevedon pier is of malleable iron. Mr J. W. Grover^[8. Min. Inst. Civ. Eng.,-vol. xxxii. ] states that each upright consists of two Barlow rails weighing 80 lb to the yard, riveted back to back, and having a total section for each 100 feet span of 64 inches. They are braced together by diagonal tie-rods from If to 2⅛ inches in diameter. The lower portions of the piles below low water are of solid wrought iron 5 inches in diameter, shod with cast-iron screws 2 feet in diameter, and were screwed down till a 4⅜-inch rope passed round 6-feet capstan bars parted with the strain. They penetrated the ground to depths varying from 7 to 17 feet, and though made with a thread of 5 inches in pitch seldom descended more than 2⅛ inches or 3 inches in a turn. The solid pile-stems are connected with the Barlow rail piles by cast-iron shoes. Where rock occurred holes were jumped, and a 4-inclι wrought-iron bar was inserted and secured by a jagged key. A shoe to receive the Barlow rail was fitted and keyed on this, and the remaining space was caulked with iron cement. The length of the longest pile is 76 feet. The level of roadway is 16 feet above extreme high water, and the height above the ground at the pier-head is about 68 feet.

Deposits and Scouring.

Deposits arise from two essentially opposite causes, viz., commotion and stagnation of the water. They are also of different kinds of material :—(1) those lighter matters, such as mud, silt, and fine sand, which are held for a time in mechanical suspension, and which, as the water approaches stagnation, are gradually dropped in the order of their specific gravity and mass; and (2) those grosser matters, such as different kinds of sand and gravel, which are rolled along the bottom or driven forward with the water by the action of waves and currents. The first-named are deposited on the lee side of piers or groins which obstruct the progress of the waves or currents, while the second accumulate on their weather sides. But the amount and the positions assumed by the deposits of the second kind depend on the direction and force of the waves or currents in relation to the foreshore and to obstructions. The amount of deposits of the first kind are little dependent on the direction of the stroke of the waves outside of the basin or sheltered place in which they are deposited.

The preservation of the depth of harbours at a level lower than that of the original bottom involves both uncertainty and expense. Where the deposit is confined to the space between high and low water-marks, the scouring by means of salt or fresh water is comparatively easy; but where it forms a bar outside of the entrance, the possibility of maintaining permanently a greater depth becomes very doubtful. The efficacy of the scour, so long as it is not impeded by enlargements of the channel, may be kept up for great distances, but it soon comes to an end after it meets the sea. When the volume of water liberated is great compared with the alveus or channel through which it has to pass, the stagnant water which originally occupied the channel does not to the same extent destroy the momentum as where the scouring has to be produced by a sudden finite impulse. In the one case the scouring power dependSj caeteris paribus, simply on the relation subsisting between the quantity liberated in a given space of time and the sectional area of the channel through which it has to pass; while in the other it depends on the propelling head, and the direction in which the water leaves the sluice. Mr RendeΓs scheme for Birkenhead was on the former principle, which it must be recollected is only applicable where the soil is easily stirred up.

The first example of artificial scouring in Eugland seems to be due to Smeaton, who used it effectively at Ramsgate in 1779. At Bute Docks, Cardiff, designed by the late Sir W. Cubitt, the access to the outer basin is kept open most successfully by means of artificial scouring on a large scale.

Minard holds that when a channel has to be maintained by regular and habitual scouring, the whole effect is generally produced in the course of the first quarter of an hour. This was made the subject of particular investigation at Dunkirk, where sections of the channel were made before and during the scour; and it was found that there was no alteration in the sectional area after the first quarter of an hour.

Causes of Increase of Height of Waves.

The following causes increase the height of waves in a harbour :—(1) the removal of a spending beach either at the entrance channel or within the harbour by building a quay or talus wall across it; (2) deepening the entrance channel or the basin of the harbour itself,—thus the difficulty of keeping vessels to their moorings at the quays of a harbour increases during flood tide, just as the tide rises and the depth is thereby increased; (3) removal of an artificial breakwater or a protecting point of land or spit of gravel outside of the harbour; (4) filling up side creeks or lateral basins in a harbour or its entrance channel; (5) shortening the distance between the sea and the entrance to an inner basin or dock by projecting the basin or dock farther out from the shore-line so as to bring the gates nearer the sea entrance, or projecting the mouth of a harbour farther seawards; (6) removal of a jetty or filling up an artificial side chamber or converting talus into plumb walls; (7) straightening an entrance channel or an outer side breakwater or walls within a harbour; (8) widening the entrance or the entrance channel; (9) reduction of the area of the basin of the harbour; (10) making smoother the surface of a natural sloping beach either within or outside of a harbour by pitching its surface; (11) lowering the top of a protecting outside breakwater over which the sea breaks; (12) converting an open Limber quay into a close quay; (13) lengthening a breakwater so as to intercept a greater portion of the waves which come in certain directions.

II. Docks.

Docks are of two kinds, viz., dry or graving docks, and wet or floating docks. The dry or graving dock is a small water-tight chamber, fitted with gates of timber or iron, which are shut against the rising tide after a vessel has [9:11:466] entered for the purpose of being repaired. The water below low tide level is pumped out generally by steam power.

The wet dock or tide basin is a large water-tight inclosure, usually several acres in extent, which is also fitted with gates which are closed, not, however, during the flowing but the ebbing tide, so that the vessels lying at the quays within the basin may remain constantly afloat and nearly at the same level while being loaded and unloaded.

In order to extend the time during which vessels can enter or leave a wet dock there are two additional works which are often connected with it. These are the entrancelock and the outer or half-tide basin. The lock is a narrow chamber of just sufficient length and breadth to admit a ship of the greatest length and breadth of beam that is expected to frequent the port. Such a lock can, in absence of the largest class of ships, accommodate simultaneously three or four vessels of smaller tonnage. Locks are sometime made with double gates, so that when only one vessel of small size has to enter, she is shut up within a compartment of the lock, by which means some of the water is saved which would have been expended had the whole of the chamber been filled. Shortly after the tide has begun to ebb, and when the gates of the wet dock have been shut, in order to prevent the water from falling too low in the dock, a vessel can still enter or leave by means of the lock. She is first passed into the lock from the sea; and, the lower or sea gates being closed, the sluices in the upper or dock gates are opened, which raises the water in the lock chamber to the same level as the water in the dock, when the upper gates are opened to let the vessel pass in. Ships leaving the dock after the tide has begun to fall are passed into the lock chamber, when the upper gates are closed and the sluices in the lower gates are opened, until the water in the lock has fallen to the same level as the tide outside, when the lower gates are opened and the vessel goes out to sea. This system of locking is continued so long as the level of the dock is not so much depressed as to affect the loading or unloading of vessels lying at the quays, or until the tide has ebbed so far as to prevent vessels reaching the lock from the sea. At the West Dock, Cardiff, where the level is kept up by fresh water from the river Taff, the gates, in order to suit the rise and fall of the tide, are opened one hour before and about two hours after high water.

The tide basin may be described as a lock of very large dimensions capable of receiving at the same time a considerable number of vessels, which continue to run into it from the sea after the dock gates have been finally closed for that tide. Such vessels can run in, so longas they have sufficient water over the sill of the sea gates of the basin, or until the basin itself is filled with ships. The sea gates are then closed, and the sluices in the upper gates are opened till the water in the basin is on a level with the water in the dock. The ships are then passed continuously into the dock, in a string, one after the other. By means of this arrangement the traffic can be carried on to a far greater extent than is possible with a narrow lock, which has to be filled and emptied for each vessel that enters or leaves the harbour. The late Mr Jesse Hartley of Liverpool was the first to propose half-tide outer basins, as adjuncts to wet docks.

The peculiar advantages s of docks are the following. Vessels can be accommodated in the smallest possible space, and are enabled to lie constantly afloat; whereas in tidal harbours, where they take the ground, they are apt to be strained or to have their floors broken. But there are other sources of mischief than this in open harbours, for often, when the tide is ebbing, vessels, unless watched, fall against each other. In two instances where the bottom, which was muddy, had a considerable declivity, a ship which had taken the ground on the beach near low water mark was actually run down and damaged by another stranded vessel, the warps of which suddenly snapped and freed her from the moorings at the quay, thus causing a collision between vessels both of which were at the time high and dry. Then there is the chafing of the vessel’s sides against the quays in exposed harbours where there is a run of sea, and the breaking of warps during stormy weather, or during land floods, where there is a river. The late Mr James Walker stated that at Sunderland damage to the extent of £40,000 was occasioned in a single day by large quantities of ice that came down the river Wear. When a vessel is in dock she can be easily and at all times moved from place to place, and the operation of discharging and loading can go regularly on during all times of tide. Her level, too, is never much affected, so that the cargo does not require, when being discharged, to be hoisted so high as would otherwise be necessary. Timber vessels can be unloaded through their ports into the water at all times of tide, while in harbours which are dry at low water the cargo receives injury by falling on the hard bottom.

From the general description which we have given the following conclusions may be drawn as to the best localities for docks :—

(1) Where the rise of tide is considerable, a dock is more required than where the rise is small. In rivers such as the Clyde and the Foyle, for example, where the tide rises only from 9 to 10 feet, the inducement to construct docks is not so great as at the Mersey or the Bristol Channel, where the tide rises from 20 to 50 feet

(2) Where the nature of the trade requires ships of great length, which are therefore very liable to injury from taking the ground, a dock is more needed than at places where the vessels are of smaller size, and therefore less liable to be strained when not water borne.

(3) Where the bottom is soft and muddy, there is less need for a dock than where the bottom is hard and uneven, unless where strong currents are likely to burrow out the soft soil so as to make the bottom irregular by forming deep ruts.

(4) Where the harbour is open to the entrance of surface waves of considerable height, or of a ground swell, there is more need for a dock than where there is better protection.

(5) Where there is sufficient fresh water, free from mud or silt, for supplying the basin, a dock will be more suitable than where the supply is from the tide, especially if the sea at the place be much loaded with matter in mechanical suspension.

In designing a dock the first subject to which the engineer must give his attention is the seaward exposure of his proposed work. Of course no precaution is needed on this head if the place be a land-locked bay, or a narrow river or estuary. But if there be a considerable fetch of open sea, the waves generated during gales may be of such height as to endanger the sea gates or to interfere with their being worked in stormy weather. The formula already given at page 457 for short lengths of fetch will be the most suitable for calculating the exposure of docks, where the fetch ought never to be great.

Having calculated by means cf this formula the height of waves that may be expected to reach the dock gates, the engineer must then determine whether such waves are too high for the strength of the gates, or for their being properly worked in stormy weather. Now we have unfortunately but few facts on this subject to guide us, and these not very consistent with each other.
[9:11:467]

Height of Waves in which Gates can be Worked.
[table]

It might at first sight be expected that the strain would increase as the squares of the breadth of the gate, but, owing to the manner in which the forces are distributed, this does not seem to be the case.

Where δ = the width of opening of the entrance in feet, and h = the height of the waves at the place, the formula 60

δ = - j - may perhaps be regarded as safe; or, where h has not il been observed, and D is length of fetch in miles,

, _ 60

1∙5 √D + (2∙5 -√D)'

Should the calculation by the formula give higher waves than are compatible with safety or convenience, the proper course will be to provide an outer harbour or covering breakwater, so as to reduce the height of the waves. For this purpose the formula given at page 462 is applicable. In cases where the course now recommended cannot be adopted, from motives of economy or from other causes, recourse may be had to protecting booms such as are described at page 463. If the traffic be considerable and the interruption caused by the shipping and unshipping of the booms be regarded a formidable objection, the gates may in some cases be protected by fastening together the tops of the mitre posts by chains. Another mode of securing gates against the sea was adopted at Ramsgate by Mr Ramsay, and is stated by Sir John Coode to be perfectly satisfactory. It consisted of the following arrangement :—

“One end of a stout beam or stay of greenheaι-t timber was connected, by means of a massive iron movable joint, to the fore part of each gate, near the middle posts on the inner or basin side, and at about the level of high water of equinoctial spring tides; the opposite end of this beam passed into an opening in the masonry of the side walls of the entrance. The inner end of this beam was supported by a small bogie truck running upon a pair of rails laid in a horizontal plane. On the vertical face of the beam nearest the gate there was a strong toothed rack working into a pinion at the end of a train of gearing, the first motion of which was a screw-and-worm wheel. By means of this gearing the power of the men was communicated to the gate through the beam or stay just described.”

After the engineer has succeeded in designing a dock which is sufficient in so far a8 the sea is concerned, it may after all not prove safe and convenient if it be exposed fully to the force of the wind, which, acting on the rigging and hulls of the shipping, causes vessels to break their moorings or produces a grinding action of the vessels against the quays. At Sunderland south dock and at the docks in the Tyne, for example, the gales of October 1863 occasioned very considerable damage, from vessels breaking adrift from their moorings and coming into collision with other vessels.

The number of vessels that can be accommodated in each acre of a harbour may be termed its “available capacity.” This must obviously vary with the sizes of the craft which frequent the port and with the ratio of sheltered to unsheltered acreage; or in other words, with the exposure, depth, and reductive power. It will therefore be highest for a dock with gates, less for a tide-basin into which the waves have access, and least of all for an anchorage breakwater or roadstead. But it also depends on the form of the basin and on its depth.

The following table contains the greatest number of vessels that can be accommodated at one time per acre for several docks :—
[table]

If n represents the number of vessels per acre, and i their average tonnage, and a is a coefficient which may be taken at from 3 to 4 according to the tonnage inversely, the formula n=12θθ4- α t may perhaps be convenient for showing, though necessarily in a very approximate way, the relative capacity for mixed shipping of proposed docks of symmetrical proportions. But the capacity will very largely depend on whether both large and small vessels frequent the port, or only vessels of one size.

The capacity for tonnage per acre is shown in the following table :—
[table]

The general form of a dock will in most cases be dependent on local peculiarities. Where the nature of the ground and other circumstances admit of it, the width of the basin should, in order to provide for the largest amount of traffic, be greater near the entrance than at a distance from it. The diagram (fig. 8) may perhaps be regarded as an approach to the form of maximum capacity which should be kept in view as a general guide in making a design. But in most situations the form will, as we have said, be mainly if not entirely dependent on the outline of the land and depth of water, on the position of adjoining streets and buildings, and on the geological formation and nature of the subsoil. The serrated outline of the jetties shown in the diagram affords a larger amount of accommodation for shipping than when the quays are continuously straight. Sir John Hawkshaw was, we believe, the first to adopt these indented jetties, which are specially suited for the coal trade; but the radiating form shown in the diagram has not, so far as we know, been adopted. Not only are numerous cross sections of the ground required for fixing on the best site for a dock, but borings of the subsoil are essential, as, upon a careful comparison of these, the position of the entrance must be determined. It is always of the greatest importance to place the foundations of the lock or entrance gates at a place where the bottom is rock, or, where that is not to be found, on the hardest and most impervious part of the subsoil, or, failing that, on a place where the bottom-though soft, is of uniform consistency.
[9:11:468]

Mr Ure, in a report on Glasgow harbour, gives the following table showing the amount of work per yard per annum :—
[table]

A great increase in the amount of trade, with the same size of dock and length of quay, may be effected by Sir William Armstrong’s patent hydraulic machinery. This principle of applying hydraulic pressure for opening gates, bridges, and sluices, or to the capstans for hauling vessels out and into dock and waggons on and off the coal tips, and for turning them on the turntables, the discharging of ballast and loading of coals, and the shipment and discharging of general cargoes, has now been successfully adopted at many harbours. Its use is, however, only warrantable where there is a great amount of traffic, and especially at places where the spring tides remain only a short time at the same level.

At the Victoria Docks, London, the late Mr Bidder mentions that 41 craft and 17 ships, or 11,711 tons, came in at one tide. In one month the number of craft entering the harbour was 1229; craft leaving, 1288; ships entering, 250; ships leaving, 258; or an aggregate of 2517 craft and 508 ships during the month. The gates, which are 80 feet span, are opened in less than 1⅛ minutes. At Sunderland the accumulators are equivalent to a head of 600 feet, and the engine is 30 horse-power. A wrought-iron bridge 16 feet wide, and including counterweights equal to nearly 200 tons, is raised vertically 18 inches, and drawn back in about 2⅜ minutes. A t Swansea the accumulators are equivalent to an effective pressure of 750 lb per square inch, and there are three high-pressure engines of 80, 30, and 12 horse-power respectively. The time employed in either opening or closing the gates is about 2⅛ minutes, which is the shortest period consistent with safety. The wroughtiron swing-bridge can be opened or shut in 1⅜ minutes. The ballast cranes, which are distributed round the dock, can each discharge from 350 to 400 tons in the day. The quantity of coal that can be shipped is about 1000 tons per day, and the effective quantity of water required for the port is 21,050 cubic feet per week. The large new bridge at Leith, designed by Messrs Rendel & Robertson, and worked by the Armstrong apparatus, is 120 feet span,—length of girder 214 feet, weight moved 750 tons,—and is opened in 1⅜ minutes. The saving of time effected by this method is very great, for at Liverpool, according to Mr A. Giles, gates of 70 feet require 20 minutes, and six men on each side to open them.

The proportion of water area to length of quays will obviously depend on the form of the docks. The following table, deduced from information kindly supplied by Mr Lyster, C.E., gives examples on this head at Liverpool :—

Total Water Area and Quay Space at Liverpool and Birkenhead.
[table]

In order to utilize the area of a dock to the best advantage, n. certain amount of land space dependent on the kind of trade should be provided around it; for without this space, which is needed for giving room for railway sidings, warehouses, and the like, the traffic would be cramped. As an illustration of the large extent of railway which is required in a coal-port, we may refer to Cardiff, whereMr M t Connochie says, “The extent of sidings provided and maintained by the Bute trustees, in connexion with the docks, amounts to 16 miles in length, the whole of which is at times fully occupied.”

The proportion of the area of outer tide basin to that of the dock to which it forms the access varies necessarily with the requirements of the trade, as is shown in the following table :—
[table]

The level of the bottom of a dock is always kept lower than that of the sill of the entrance gates, in order to admit of a certain amount of deposit taking place without injuriously affecting the depth of water in which the vessels lie, or interfering with the working of the gates. There should never be less than 1 foot of greater depth over the bottom of the dock than over the entrance sill.

The commercial advantage of a great depth of water over the sill has been well shown by Mr George Robertson in his report on the Albert Dock at Leith. By increasing the depth to the extent of 2 feet he found there would be 396 tides in the year giving a depth of 23 feet over the sill, as against only 102 tides in the year when that depth could be had if the sill were only 2 feet high. But besides the advantage of availing ourselves of a greater number of tides, Mr T. Stevenson found, from an examination of the draughts and tonnage of a large number of sailing vessels, that the commercial advantages in a navigable river, dock, or harbour are proportional to the cubes of the depths.

The relation subsisting between the depth of a dock or channel and the tonnage of sailing vessels which can use it is given by the formula i=T3<Z 3 , or d= t i from which the following table has been calculated
[table]

In fixing the minimum width that will admit vessels of the size which are expected to trade at the harbour, the engineer must take care to preserve a proper relation between the area of the dock and the width of the entrance; for if this relation be neglected, a current may be generated through the entrance when the tide begins to ebb, which would be incompatible with the safe working of the gates. A very small current is sufficient to act injuriously in this way, especially if the gates be of great width. Whenever the internal area of the proposed basin is considerable, it will be a safe precaution to calculate the velocity of the outgoing current, at different periods of time, after the tide has begun to ebb; and for this purpose observations of the fall of the tide must be carefully made and compared with the proposed transverse sectional area of the passage through the lock chamber. If the velocity thus obtained be thought too great for the safe working of gates of the size required, the only alternative is to provide an additional lock. But a double outlet will at any rate be in all probability needed, or will at least prove a great convenience in all cases where a large internal basin is required.
[9:11:469]

The late Dr Rank in e in his Manual of Civil Engineering gives the following table for the expenditure of water due to the passage of vessels through the lock :—

Let L denote a lockful of water, that is, the volume contained in the lock chamber between the upper and lower water levels, andBtlιe volume displaced by a ship, then the quantities of water discharged from the dock are shown in the table. The sign — prefixed to a quantity of water denotes that it is displaced from the lock into the dock.
[table]

From these calculations it appears that ships ascending and descending alternately cause less expenditure of water than equal numbers of ships in train.

The level of the surface of the water in a dock will of course sink in proportion to the number of times the lock has to be filled during each tide, and may also be affected to a small extent by leakage. In order to provide for this depression of level, the old dock of Grimsby, and also the Bute Docks, Cardiff, are supplied by land streams, while at Penarth Sir John Hawkshaw was unable to get a supply of pure water, and the dock at that port is supplied from the tide water of the Bristol Channel, which holds in suspension a large amount of alluvial matter. In the old London docks the level is kept up by pumping.

If the masonry of the walls has been properly constructed, and if the gates and lock are kept in proper repair, and especially if the basin be of large area, the depression of the water level due to leakage, will, as appears from the following table, be comparatively trifling :—
[table]

The principal works required in the construction of docks are— first, cofferdams for excluding the tide, and puιηps for keeping the basin dry while the works are going on; second, excavation of the basin and lock pit; third, piling for the foundations of quay walls and lock, where the bottom is soft; fourth, the building of the quay walls, lock, and outer tide basin; fifth, entrance gates, gangway, and dolphins in the channel outside of the dock for facilitating the entry and departure of vessels.

As to the first of these works, namely, the cofferdam and pumping apparatus, reference is made to the articles on these subjects in this work; and as to the second and third, there is nothing requiring special notice, as no peculiarity attaches to the mode of carrying on excavation or piling for docks more than for any other engineering undertaking where these are needed. It is only necessary to point out that when the bottom is soft a large amount of piling is required, more especially at the lock pit, where rows of sheeting piles should be driven across the lock, at least at the entrance, and in the lines of the clap or pointing sills against which the gates shut.

The fourth class of works, namely, quays and lock, are in all cases most important features in a dock. Different rules have been given by engineers for the proportions of quay walls. Mr A. Giles recommends that they should be made strong enough to resist the pressure of α head of water equal to their own height; and Minard recommends their thickness at bottom to be 1 ⅛ths of their height.

The recent use of Portland cement concrete in the construction of harbours has led to its introduction at doek works. In the small dock erected in 1875 at Berwick-on-Tweed, Messrs Stevenson had the dock walls and gate chamber constructed entirely of Portland cement concrete, excepting a small portion at and above the high water level, against which the vessels might rub; and Mr Rendel at the new Victoria Docks, London, which are the longest in the world, is making the whole masonry of cement concrete.

Graving docks are basins sometimes 600 feet long and 60 or 70 feet wide, fitted with gates, from which the tidewater which floats the vessel into the dock is pumped out, so as to let the carpenters get access to the ship’s bottom. The sides of graving docks consist of a series of steps of masonry, called “altars,” against which small timber props, generally of Gulf of Bothnia timber, are placed, for supporting the vessel’s sides as she ceases to be water-borne. Her keel is supported on blocks, generally of hard wood, but of late years they have in some places been made of cast iron. The sides, in order to save pumping, are in some placée made of a curved form, so as to suit the shape of the vessel’s sides. The advantages are, however, more than counterbalanced by the undue contraction of the space allotted for the carpenters, who are unable to move about easily on the sloping surface of the masonry.

Of all the different kinds of masonry which enter into the construction of marine works, there is none which requires greater accuracy of workmanship, or more careful circumspection, than the graving dock. Leakage in & wet dock, provided it does not originate at a place whereit is liable to increase through time, and is of no greater extent than to depress the surface of the water a few inches, cannot be regarded as a serious evil. But in a graving dock, where the requirements are different, there should be no leakage. A very little water, accumulating on the platform, of a dry dock, interferes to a serious extent with the comfort and convenience of the carpenters. Although it may occasion considerable additional expense, there ought to be in all cases, especially where the soil is full of springs, an ample underground storage provided by a system of drains for receiving the leakage, which can then be pumped out periodically, as required, without ever allowing the water to rise above the platform.

Mr. G. B. Rennie’s docks are stated to be the first of the kind that have been made of iron. They consist of floating caissons for holding the vessel to be repaired. They are sunk by allowing them to fill with water, and are raised by pumping. The caissons are made with water-tight compartments, and they are carried up as high as the vessel’s bulwarks, excepting that through which the vessel enters and leaves. Among several advantages that have been claimed for this kind of dock may be mentioned—its independence of the rise and fall of the tide, the power of applying breast shores as in an ordinary graving dock, and the stiffness produced by the side walls. As the upper parts of the side walls or altars are always full of air, this dock may be used in deep water, and is therefore independent of the nature of the bottom.

Mr Edwin Clark’s hydraulic lift, at the Victoria Docks, London, consists of a pontoon which is filled with water and sunk between two rows of iron columns. After a vessel has been floated and steadied upon the pontoon, the whole is raised by twelve hydraulic force-pumps of 2 feeb diameter, acting on the pontoon by means of chains. After the [9:11:470] pontoon has been brought about the tide-level, the water is allowed to escape, when there is sufficient floating power to admit of the whole being removed to any place where the repairs can be conveniently made. The pontoons, which can accommodate vessels of a length of 350 feet, are about 320 feet long and 59∣ feet broad. “The power of the hydraulic lift is 6400 tons. The largest pontoon will carry a dead load of 3200 tons in addition to its own weight.”

Slips are the contrivance of the late Mr Thomas Morton of Leith, and consist of a carriage or cradle working on an inclined railway, falling generally at the rate of about 1 in 17, and extending above high water to a sufficient distance for the class of vessels which are expected to use them to several feet below the level of low water, and a truck or carriage which moves on it. When the carriage is let down under the water, the vessel is floated above the place, and the carriage is drawn up till the vessel catches it forwards. When the ship is placed truly above the line of the carriage, a powerful crab-purchase at the top of the slip, which is generally worked by steam, is set in motion, and raises the truck and ship out of the water.

The gridiron is a simple framework of timber placed at a level sufficient to admit of vessels being floated above it during the flood-tide, and grounded upon it during the ebb, and when thus left high and dry the vessel’s bottom can be examined to ascertain if it be necessary to take her into the graving dock, and trifling repairs can also be made. The gridirons at Liverpool vary from 25 feet to 36 feet 3 inches in breadth, and from 228 feet 3 inches to 313 J feet in length.^[9. “Historical and Descriptive Sketch of the Mersey Docks and Harbour,” by J. J. Rinckel, in the Artizan for 1864. ]

The hydraulic and screw docks used in America are chambers into which vessels are floated during the floodtide, above a cradle which is drawn up above the high water level, either by means of Bramah’s press worked by a steam-engine, or by a powerful apparatus of screws.

The patent slip possesses the following advantages over the graving dock. (1) The cost of its construction is less. (2) When the fall of tide is languid, a vessel can generally be more quickly laid dry. (3) When so laid dry she can be more easily examined, and, from the duration of the daylight being greater than in a deep graving dock, the time in which work can be done is considerably extended during winter. (4) There is more perfect ventilation, by which the vessel’s sides are sooner dried, which is of some moment with an iron ship. (5) A vessel can be hauled up long before high water, and the repairs can be begun at once; whereas with a dock the pumping occasions considerable delay. (6) While the upper part of the slip is occupied, an additional vessel mιy be taken up for a shorter time than its predecessor, without interrupting the workmen.

The advantages afforded by a graving dock, on the other hand, are these. (1) Although its construction is more costly, it is nevertheless, if properly built, unquestionably a more durable structure—the rails, rollers, carriages, and chains connected with the slip being liable to derangement, which entails occasional repair. (2) The management of the graving dock is simple, and involves comparatively little superintendence; whereas that of a slip is intricate, and requires more than mere nautical skill. (3) The working of a graving dock is equally simple for large or small vessels, while it is undeniable that the raising of a large vessel on a slip is a delicate operation, and should be attempted only under the direction of persons thoroughly versed in such matters, and having ample mechanical resources at command. (4) The graving dock possesses the advantage, which is sometimes important, of affording the means of more easily filling a vessel with water, so as to detect leaks which may not be discoverable by other means. For this purpose a nozzle to receive a flexible tube should be fixed into the dock-gates. (5) Where double gates are provided the water contained in the dock affords a certain limited power of scouring the forebay and entrance, an advantage which is of course not possessed by a slip. (6) In any rapid land current, or strong tideway, it is a much easier process to dock a vessel t ’ han to land her safely on the cradle of a slip—an operation which, when incautiously gone about, has been in some cases attended with serious consequences even in sheltered situations. (7) The graving dock need not interfere with the set of the currents, whereas a slip which projects a long way seaward of low water may deflect them and produce shoals in the channel. (8) Mr Mallet has remarked that the strains on a ship’s timbers are more direct than when she is on a slip, especially when she is leaving the cradle. The late Mr J. M. Balfour suggested, in order to meet this objection, that the cradle for a slip might be made of a wedge shape, so that its upper surface shall be parallel with the horizon, or that the back end should even be tilted slightly, so as to give a bite on the vessel and prevent her from slipping.

The relative advantages of the other contrivances for the repair of ships already described may be judged of by comparing them with each other in a similar manner.

Mr P. W. Barlow has given the following formulae for the strength of dock-gates :—

Formula for Straight Gates.

If <∕> = horizontal angle(or “sally ”) between pointing sillandline joining heel-posts of the two leaves; W=pressure on the length of the gate with any head and for a given depth of the gate; and S=~hole transverse strain at angle φ ; then

S = ⅛W sec ≠ + τ⅛ cos φ.

From this Mr Barlow has deduced that the salient angle, where the strain is the minimum, is 24° 54', but as the length of the gate increases with the secant, the strength will not at this angle be the greatest with a given section of timber. The “sally” or angle which gives the greatest strength, with a given section of timber, is stated by him as 19° 25'.

Formula for Curved Gates.

When θ is the salient angle, or camber of the beam, formed by a chord line drawn from the heel to the mitre-post, with the tangent to the curve of the gate—

S=iwj 1 - s ⅛⅛j.

There is great difference of opinion among engineers as to the strain to which dock gates are subjected, and the reader is referred for further information to the 18th and 31st volumes of the Minutes of Proceedings of the Institution of Civil Engineers. In these discussions Mr Brown pointed out an error in Mr P. W. Barlow’s paper, which stated that the line of pressure at the mitre-posts would always be a tangent to the curve of the separate gates, whereas that line must always be at right angles to the centre line of the lock, and could only be a tangent to the curve when the two gates formed a segment of a circle, or, as Mr Bramwell says, at all events when their junction at the mitre-posts formed at that point part of a continuous curve. Mr Brown gives elaborate formulae suited to meet a yielding or deflexion of the structure, which he alleges must always take place. Mr Bramwell states, and we think justly, that, when the gates form when closed a segment of a circle, they cannot be subject to transverse strain, and that the whole of the gates would be subjected simply to compression. Mr R. P. Brereton very properly suggests that when the gates are of malleable iron the boiler-plate should never be less than ⅛ inch thick, what ever the formula may indicate.

Where l represents the length of one-half of a straight or cambered malleable iron gate, w the distributed pressure over the length of the leaf taken on a given element of the gate, bounded by two horizontal planes 1 foot apart, t the thickness of framework of gate or distance between the two skins, s the transverse strain in middle of gate, θ half of the mitring angle—i.e., the angle formed by meeting of gates—all the dimensions being in feet, and-weight in tons,—then

⅜wZ

4i ’

⅜ s=sectional area of metal on compressed side in inches; ⅜ s do. do. on extended side do.; iw tan θ = compressive strain produced by other leaf of gate.
[9:11:471]

Mr Kingsbury adds half of this compressive strain to the strain representing the compression due to the transverse pressure, and deducts it from the same amount for the extension; and these results being divided as before by 4 and 5 respectively, being the allowances per square inch of metal for compression and extension, give the areas for each. He, however, expresses a doubt whether the whole of the compressive strain from the other gate may not perhaps come upon the compressed section. The sections close to the posts he takes as requiring to resist the compression due ⅜w tan 0 to transmitted pressure only, or=

For cylindrical gates Mr Kingsbury gives the formula,—when p —pressure per unit of surface, and r= radius of curvature,—

-j-= sectional area of metal in square inches.

It must be remembered in designing gates which are exposed to the waves that they should be made stronger than these formulae require. And the gates for graving or dry docks sustain a greater pressure with the same rise of tides than those of wet docks, and should therefore be made correspondingly stronger.

Caissons are sometimes employed instead of gates, and are the invention of the late General Bentham. They are constructed of malleable iron plates and are sometimes made in the form of a ship’s hull, and sometimes have vertical sides. The caisson fits into checks made for its reception in the side walls of the entrance to the dock. They require to be very carefully ballasted, and to be most accurately fitted to the masonry on the sides and bottom, and even when they are faced with timber which has been finely dressed and fitted, coal cinders are often needed to make the joints water tight. At high water they are floated into the grooves, and are then scuttled by admitting the water into the interior chamber. When a vessel has to leave the dock, the water is again pumped out, and the caisson is then floated out of its place and taken into the river or harbour, so as to be out of the - way of the vessel which is leaving. General Bentham says caissons are cheaper than gates, occupy less room, are more easily repaired, and the same caisson may be used for different places at different times, while they answer for roadways, and require less labour for opening.

The caisson at Keysham was designed by Mr Scamp, deputydirector of the Admiralty works, and is 80 feet wide and 43 feet deep, with an air-chamber at the bottom. When raised a few inches above the bottom, the caisson is drawn back into a recess or chamber in the side walls. The total weight is 290 tons, and the deflexion was f inch near the bottom, when the pressure of the whole surface was 2000 tons. The time for opening and closing the entrance at Keysham is 10 minutes and 8 minutes respectively. The cost was about £10,000.

Mr M t Connochie says that the iron caisson at Cardiff is 60 feet long, 26 feet greatest width, and 30⅜ feet deep, with a total weight of 152 tons.

The outer gangway at entrance to docks is generally a structure of open timber work, erected in the line which will best suit the entrance of vessels when under the influence of currents. This gangway is sometimes useful for a vessel discharging her passengers or completing her cargo while the gates are shut. Mr Redman remarks that “the practice in the port of London is to dock a ship upon the flood just before the high water, and to undock her at ab-? it the same period of tide. . . . The directions as apparently the most desirable are an angle of about 45° pointing up ths streams for graving docks, an angle of about 60° in a similar direction for wet docks, and a right angle for building slips.”

It is of importance in discharging coal into ships that the fall should be as small as possible.

At Bramley Moor Dock, Liverpool, the Wigan coal is discharged by railway 18 feet above the quay. At Sunderland Mr Meik finds that 20 feet above'the quays, as at the south dock, is too small for the shoots, and prefers 36 feet. At Penaτth the height is 22, and they are able to lift 180 tons per hour. At Greenock, where steam cranes are used, they load about 500 tons a day. At Middlesboro’ they can discharge 150 tons per hour, but 106 tons are as much as can be trimmed on board. At Cardiff, where there is no hydraulic machinery, they load 100 tons an hour. The distance between the staiths is 180 feet. At the Tyne Docks, Mr Harrison states that on one occasion, when a vessel had very long hatchways admitting of several waggons being simultaneously discharged, 420 tons of coal have been snipped in 55 minutes, a feat which shows the admirable mechanism employed.

At Swansea, with hydraulic machinery, they can discharge from 350 to 400 tons a day, and those at Penarth load at the rate of 60 tons an hour.

The Law of Harbours and Ports.

The power of appointing suitable places to be ports or havens in England is one of the ancient prerogatives of the crown, founded, as Blackstone thinks, partly upon the rights of the king as conservator of the kingdom, partly upon his interest in the marine revenues. “In England it hath always been holden that the sovereign is lord of the whole shore, and particularly is guardian of the ports and havens which are the inlets and gates of the realm, and therefore, so early as the reign of King John, we find ships seized by the king’s officers for putting in at a place that was not a legal port.” The right of the king to make a harbour, and to grant the dues arising from the use thereof, in any suitable place, although the ownership of the soil may be in another, is subject to any vested rights of harbour already existing; and in the recent case of Foreman v. the Free Fishers of Whitstable, it was said that the right of the public freely to navigate the high seas is a paramount right to which the right of the crown in the soil is necessarily subservient, and therefore, as the right of navigation must include the right of anchorage, the crown or its grantee could not impose a toll on this use of its soil. To justify such a toll some facts must be shown proving that the soil was originally within the precincts of a port or harbour, or that some service or aid to navigation was rendered, in respect of which the alleged right of toll was granted. The crown having once granted a harbour could not afterwards narrow its limits, but by 16 and 17 Viet, c. 107 the crown is enabled to ascertain the limits of all ports, and to assign quays thereon for the enclosure, loading, and landing of merchandize, so that frauds on the revenue may be prevented.

The Act 10 and 11 Vict. c. 27 consolidates the clauses usually inserted in private acts authorizing the construction of harbours; 24 and 25 Vict. c. 45 facilitates the formation and improvement of piers and harbours in Great Britain and Ireland; and 25 and 26 Vict. c. 69 and 28 and 29 Vict. c. 100 transfer from the Admiralty to the Board of Trade certain powers and duties relative to harbours. Besides these general Acts, there are many special Acts relating to particular harbours.
