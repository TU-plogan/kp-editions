HAGEDORN, Friedrich von (170S-1755), one of the most distinguished German poets in the earlier half of last century, was born April 23, 1708, at Hamburg, where his father was Danish minister at the court of Lower Saxony. The father, a man of scientific and literary tastes, possessed a valuable library of French literature, and dabbled also in the science of alchemy. Having by this and other means lost a great part of his fortune, he died in 1722, leaving in poor circumstances a widow and two sons, of whom the poet was the elder. He was educated at the gymnasium of Hamburg, and went later (1726) to study jurisprudence at Jena. Shortly after his return to Hamburg in 1729, he obtained the appointment of private secretary without salary to the Danish ambassador in London, where he lived till 1731, and published two small works in English. His return to Hamburg was followed by a period of great poverty and hardship, a scanty income being derived from the posts which he held in the Hamburg cathedral and among the mining population in Klausthal. In 1733 Hagedorn became secretary to the so-called “English court” in Hamburg, a trading company founded in the 13th century, and formerly known as “Die Societät der Aventurier Kaufleute.” He shortly afterwards married, and from this time, with a settled income and sufficient leisure to pursue his literary occupations, led a pleasant and congenial existence, surrounded by friends and admirers, till his death, at the early age of forty-seven, October 28, 1755.

Hagedorn is known as the author of satirical, didactic, and moral verses, epigrams, odes, fables, and songs. His popularity during his lifetime was great. Although he held himself aloof from any poetical school, he nevertheless exercised an important influence on the German poetry of his time; for, besides being a learned man and well-read in the ancient and modern classics, he was a special admirer of French literature, the study of which gained for him an ease and mobility before unknown in German versification. He has been called the originator in Germany of the modern song, and some of his Lieder were set to music by the favourite composers of his day. His popularity, however[9:11:369], is now long past. His learning and his style have been eclipsed by later and greater poets, and he who was at one time the “allgemeine Bewunderung von Deutschland’’ now ranks only among the secondary German classics.

The first collection of Hagedorn’s poems was published at Hamburg shortly after his return from Jena in 1729, under the title Versuch einiger Gedichte, oder erlesene Proben poetischer Nebenstunden. In 1738 appeared Versuch in poetischen Fabeln und Erzählungen ; in 1747 a collection of his lyric poems, under the title Sammlung neuer Oden und Lieder; and his Moralische Gedichte in 1750. A collection of his entire works was published at Hamburg after his death in 1756, and a smaller edition in 1767. The best is Eschenburg’s edition, 5 vols., 1800, republished, with Hagedorn’s correspondence, in 1825. See C. H. Schmid, Biographie von Hagedorn.
