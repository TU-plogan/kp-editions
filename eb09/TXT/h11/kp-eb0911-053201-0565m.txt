HAWARDEN, a market-town of Flintshire, North Wales, 8 miles S.W. of Chester, is a clean and tolerably well-built place, situated on an eminence commanding an extensive prospect. It lies in the midst of a coal district, and near it are valuable clay-beds. Coarse earthenware, drainingtiles, and fire-clay bricks form the chief manufactures of the district. The family of Maude derive the title of viscount from the town. Population (1871) of the township, 6782; of the parish (including Saltney), 8683. In the neighbourhood is Hawarden Castle, built in 1752, and added to and altered in the Gothic style in 1814; it stands near the ruins of the old castle of that name which was granted by the Conqueror to his nephew Hugh Lupus, and which after many vicissitudes came into the possession of Serjeant Glynne, lord chief-justice of England under Cromwell. On the death in 1874 of Sir Stephen R. Glynne, the last of a line of baronets, the castle passed to his brother-in-law the eminent statesman Mr W. E. Gladstone.
