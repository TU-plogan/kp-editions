HAJJI KHALFA. Mustafa ’bn Abdallah, Kâtib Che-lepi (c. 1600-1658), commonly known as Haji (or Hadji) Khalfa (more properly Hâjji Khalifah), was the author of an encyclopaedia in Arabic of Oriental biography and bibliography. He was born at Constantinople about the beginning of the 17th century of the Christian era, and after passing the earlier part of his life in military service, studied under Cadhizâdeh Effendi, a learned doctor at the Ottoman capital, and made great progress in Arabic literary and linguistic studies. In June 1633 he again accompanied the army to Syria, but while the troops were in winter quarters at Aleppo, he himself performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, whence he took the cognomen of Hajji, “Pilgrim.” Returning in 1635 to Constantinople, he resumed his literary studies, and occupied himself with visiting all the libraries and book shops, and compiling an inventory of their contents, together with notices of the authors of the various works. In 1638 he attended the lectures of Sheikh A’raj Mustafazadah, whom he proposed to himself as an example to imitate in his future literary career. Besides his purely literary studies he also devoted himself assiduously to the sciences, and became well versed in logic, geometry, geography, astronomy, and the like. Nor were medicine and the occult sciences neglected by him, so that there were few of the subjects treated of in the works which he delighted to describe with which he was not more or less technically acquainted. About 1648 he was appointed assessor (khalifa) to the principal of the imperial college, whence he took the title of Khalfa, by which, with the prefix of Hajji (Pilgrim), he is commonly designated. He died in September 1658.

Besides his great Bibliographical Lexicon, he composed several other works, chiefly geographical and historical; of these the best known are Τakιcimuιtawdrikh or “Chronological Tables,” Tuhfat cl KubArfi asf(iri Bahàr, a work on the science of naval warfare, Jchân Numà or “Mirror of the World,” and one or two treatises on miscellaneous literary subjects. The language in which he wrote is Arabic, and the style is that which the nature of his studies would [9:11:378] lead usto expect,—correct and grammatical, fairly classical, and abounding in technical terms and phraseology. Of the amount of his learning and of his indefatigable application to study his Lexicon is a lasting memorial. There is scarcely a work in the whole range of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish literature, no matter on what subject or science, but it will be found described in this vast encyclopaedia, with every piece of collateral information which it was possible to procure or useful to mention. When we remember that it is the Oriental habit to give fancy titles to books that often in no way indicate the nature of their contents, and that one is often obliged to read through pages of irrelevant matter before arriving either at the author’s name or the subject of the work, the labour expended on the production of Hajji Khalfa’s book appears absolutely incredible. The work has always enjoyed a well-deserved reputation in the East, and has attracted the attention of many European scholars, but we need only mention here the magnificent edition in seven thick 8vo volumes by the eminent Arabic scholar Gustavus Fluegel published at Leipsic in 1835- 1858 for the Oriental Translation Fund of Great Britain and Ireland. This edition is accompanied by a Latin page-for-page translation, indices, and notes, and is an indispensable adjunct to every library in which a collection of Oriental books is found. The Arabic title of the lexicon is Kashfu zzunιin 'an Asdmt 'l Kutub wa ’ lfundn, ,f The removal of doubts concerning the names of books and concerning sciences,” and the Latin title adopted by Fluegel is Lexicon Bibliographicum et Encyclopoedicum Haji Khalfae. After a short preface and an introduction of five chapters comes the encyclopaedia proper, the articles in which are arranged in the alphabetical order of the names of the works described. The title of each work is given, a concise account of its contents, the name of the author, and the date, when this could be ascertained; and in many cases the initial phrase is also added to facilitate its identification. Besides the general bibliography, Fluegel’s edition contains several appendices of great value to Oriental scholars and librarians. Copious notes and indices complete this splendid edition, one of the finest monuments of Oriental learning which Europe has produced.
