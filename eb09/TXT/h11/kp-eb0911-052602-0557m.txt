HAVERFORDWEST (in Welsh Hwlffordd), the chief town of Pembrokeshire, a seaportÂ·, market-town, parliamentary and municipal borough, and county by itself, is picturesquely situated on a hill overlooking the West Cleddau river, 8 miles N.N.E. of Milford, and 276 miles W.N.W. of London. The town is clean and well built, though somewhat irregular, owing to its position. Its principal buildings are the guildhall and the market-house, both modern, and the church of St Mary, one of the finest churches in South Wales. The old church of St Martin is close to the castle, of which, built on a rocky eminence overhanging the river, only a wall and the keep remain, the latter with considerable additions being till lately used as the county prison. It was built by Gilbert de Clare, first earl of Pembroke; and during the insurrection of Owen Glendower wa3 defended for Henry IV. against the French allies of the Welsh. In the civil wars of the 17th century it was held by the royalists. The castle was visited in 1188 by Giraldus Cambrensis and Archbishop Baldwin. Below the end of the Parade, a public walk overlooking the river, are the ruins of a priory of Black Canons of the order of St Augustine, dedicated to St Mary and St Thomas. Dating from the 12th century it was endowed though not founded by Robert de Hwlffordd, whose liberal grants were confirmed by Edward III. The old wall and fortifications that formerly surrounded the town have totally disappeared. On the north side of the river is the suburb of Prendergast, containing the remains of an ancient mansion, formerly occupied by a family of that name. Haverfordwest is the seat of an assize court and quarter sessions, and with the contributory boroughs of Fishguard and Narberth returns one member to parliament. The river is navigable as high as the bridge for small craft. Timber, tea, and spirits are imported, and coal, cattle, butter, and grain are exported. In 1105, the Flemings, who had been driven from their own country by inundations, were settled in this locality by Henry I., and the Flemings who had served under Stephen afterwards increased the colony. Their influence is still to be traced in the non-use of the V elsh language among the townspeople, and in the peculiar shape of the cottages in the surrounding country. Population in 18/1, 6622; area. 1430 acres.
