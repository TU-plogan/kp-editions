HINDLEY, a manufacturing town of Lancashire, is situated on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway, 3 miles south-east of Wigan. Cotton-spinning and the manufacture of cotton goods are the principal industries, and there are extensive coal-mines in the neighbourhood. Hindley possesses a grammar school, and among its places of worship may be mentioned the old parish church, and St Peterâ€™s church, erected in 1864 in the First Pointed style. In the time of the Puritan revolution Hindley church was entered by the Cavaliers, who played at cards in the pews, pulled down the pulpit, and tore the bible in pieces. The population in 1871 was 10,627.
