HAY FEVER, Hay Asthma, or Summer Catarrh, a term applied to a catarrhal affection of the respiratory mucous membrane occurring in some individuals during the hay season, and. generally believed to be due to the inhalation of the emanations from the spring grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum). It is an ailment of comparatively rare occurrence. The symptoms are those commonly experienced in the case of a severe cold or influenza, consisting of headache, violent sneezing, and watery discharge from the nostrils and eyes, together with dry hard cough, and occasionally severe asthmatic paroxysms. The attack usually runs a course of from two to six weel<3, unless cut short by appropriate treatment, to which the complaint is in a considerable measure amenable. There is generally an annual recurrence of the disorder in those liable to it if they are exposed to its exciting cause, namely, the presence of hay. Symptoms of a similar character are produced in certain persons by the aroma of various flowers, by ipecacuan, and by the odour from cats, dogs, and rabbits. All such cases are examples of idiosyncrasy, and the individual is in general permanently susceptible to the influence of the excitant. In not a few instances an hereditary liability is traceable. The most effectual method of treatment in hay fever is to avoid the exciting cause, namely, the neighbourhood of grass fields, during the particular season. Removal to the seaside often succeeds in putting an end to an attack, and many persons who are liable to the complaint make such a change annually before its expected onset, and thus escape. Forthose who are unable to accomplish this, and must remain exposed to the noxious emanation, the use of a respirator is recommended. Of medicinal agents for affording relief during an attack, the usual remedies for asthma may be advantageously resorted to (see Asthma), while the use of the nasal douche with a weak solution of quinine and the employment of creosote or carbolic acid inhalations have been suggested.
