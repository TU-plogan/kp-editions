HELLIN(Hl·unum), a town of Spain, in the province of Albacete, is situated on the slope of the Sierra de Segura, 35 miles S.S.E. of Albacete. It is a cleau and well-built town, and possesses the remains of an old Roman castle and a beautiful parish church, the masonry and marble pavement at the entrance of which are worthy of special notice. The principal manufactures are sulphur obtained from the celebrated mines about 13 miles distant, earthenware, linens, cloth, hats, leather, and oil. Hellin was sacked by the French under Montbrun; and was the point where Joseph and Soult united with Suchet after Marmont’s rout at Salamanca. The population is about 8000.
