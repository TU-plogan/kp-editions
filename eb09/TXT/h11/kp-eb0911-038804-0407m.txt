HALL, Charles Francis (1821-1871), an Arctic explorer, was born at Rochester, New Hampshire, United States, in 1821. After following the trade of blacksmith he became a journalist in Cincinnati, but his enthusiasm for Arctic exploration led him in 1859 to volunteer to the American Geographical Society to “go in search of the bones of Franklin.” With the proceeds of a subscription he was equipped for his modest expedition, and obtained a passage in May 1860 on board a New London whaling vessel commanded by Captain Buddington, the same who had picked up the English search-ship “Resolute.” The whaler having become blocked up with ice, Hall took up his abode with the Eskimo, living with them for two years, adopting their habits and acquiring their language, making special friends of two natives, man and wife, who had been in England and knew something of our language. He wandered about with the Eskimo in the region to the north of Hudson’s Bay, acquiring much information, especially about the people. He published an account of his experiences in 1864, under the title of Arctic Pesearches, and Life among the Esquimaux. Having learned little or nothing, however, about the fate of the Franklin expedition, he returned in 1864, remaining among the Eskimo till 1869. Unfortunately the full journal he kept of his five years’ wanderings has never been published. The expedition which brought Hall most prominently into notice was fitted out in 1871 in the steamer “Polaris,” which was sent out at the expense of the United States Government, its object being to reach the supposed open Polar Sea, and if possible attain the Pole. Hall was in command, while Buddington was sailing master. There was a modest but competent scientific staff, and among the crew were Hall’s two old Eskimo friends, who had became devoted to him. On June 29, 1871, the “Polaris” left New York, and making a remarkably rapid passage up Davis Straits and Smith Sound, reached on August 30 the lat. of 82° 16' N., until the last English expedition the highest northern latitude reached of which there is any authentic report. Hall and most of the officers and crew were for proceeding onwards, but they were overruled by Buddington, and went into winter quarters in a sheltered cove on the Greenland coast, named Polaris Bay, in 81° 38' N. On October 24th Hall returned from a successful sledge expedition to the north, and was suddenly seized by an illness of which he died on November 8th. As there were some suspicions of poison, an inquiry was made by the Navy Department, who found that there was no proof of foul play. Captain Buddington, on whom the command devolved, determined [9:11:389] in August of next year to return, but the “Polaris” was greatly hampered by the ice. The danger became so great that on October 15 th boats and stores were put on the ice, on which nineteen of the crew had disembarked. Suddenly the ship broke away, and the party on the ice drifted slowly southwards for 195 days, and were picked up off the coast of Labrador, in 53° 35' N., by a whaling steamer 2000 miles from where they had parted with the “Polaris.” The party in the ship reached Littleton’s Island, where they passed the winter, building two boats from the boards of the vessel, in which they set sail southwards in June 1873. On the 23d of that mouth they were picked up by a Dundee whaler, and were brought to that town, from which they ultimately reached the United States. The scientific results of the unfortunate Hall’s last expedition were of considerable importance, and have been published by the United States Government, as also has an independent account in German by Dr Bessels, one of the scientific staff.
