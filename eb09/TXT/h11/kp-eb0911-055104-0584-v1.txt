HEARNE, Samuel (1745-1792), an English explorer, was born at London in 1745. At the age of eleven he entered the Royal Navy as midshipman in the vessel of Lord Hood, but at the conclusion of the war he took service with the Hudson’s Bay Company as quartermaster. In 1768 he was appointed to examine portions of the coast of Hudson’s Bay with a view to the improvement of the codfishing, when he executed his task with such ability that it was resolved to employ him in the discovery of the northwest passage, and of certain mines of copper whose existence was asserted by the Indians. His first attempt, upon which he set out on November 6, 1769, was unsuccessful owing to the desertion of the Indians; and his second, entered upon on 23d February 1770, was by the breaking of his quadrant likewise rendered abortive; but in his third expedition, upon which he started in December 1770, he was completely successful, as he not only discovered the existence of copper on the banks of what is now known as Coppermine river, but traced the course of that river till it joined the Arctic Ocean. After an absence of eighteen months and twenty-three days he arrived at Fort Churchill, of which he was subsequently promoted to be the governor. He returned to England in 1787, and died there in 1792. An account of his journeys from Prince of Wales Fort to the Northern Ocean was published posthumously in 1795.
