HERMON, the highest mountain in Syria (9150 feet above the Mediterranean), an outlier of the Antilebanon. The name ∣iθ"}∏, “separate,” is perhaps due to its isolated position. The Sidonians called it Sirion, and the Amorites Shenir (Deut. iii. 9;. It is probably the “high mountain” near Caesarea Philippi where the Transfiguration occurred (Mark ix. 2). The modern name is Jebel esh Sheikh, or “chief mountain.” It is also called Jebel eth Thelj, “snowy mountain.” The ridge of Hermon, rising into a dome-

shaped summit, is 20 miles long, extending north-east and south-west. The formation is a hard dark-grey crystalline limestone belonging to the Neocomian period, and full of fossils. The spurs consist in some cases of white chalk covering the limestone, and on the south there are several basaltic outbreaks. The mountain in spring is covered with snow, but in autumn there is occasionally none left, even in the ravines. To the height of 500 feet it is clothed with oaks and brush, while luxuriant vineyards abound. Above the snow limit the mountain is bare and covered with fine limestone shingle. The summit is a plateau from which three rocky knolls rise up, that on the west being the lowest, that on the south-east the highest 1 On the south slope of the latter are remains of the small temple or sacellum described by St Jerome. A semicircular dwarf wall of good masonry runs round this peak, and a trench excavated in the rock may perhaps indicate the site of an altar. On the plateau is a cave about 25 feet square, with the entrance on the east. A rock column supports the roof, and a building once stood above. The view from Hermon is very extensive, embracing all Lebanon and the plains east of Damascus, with Palestine as far as Carmel and Tabor. On a clear day Jaffa may also be seen. Other small temples are found on the sides of Hermon, of which twelve in all have been explored. They face the east, and are dated by architects about 200 A.D. The most remarkable are those of Deir el , Ashaiyir, Hibbar^ιyeh, Hosn Nihα, and Tell Thatha. At the ruined town called Rukhleh on the northern slopes are remains of a temple, the stones of which have been built into a church. A large medallion 5 feet in diameter, with a head supposed to represent the sun-god, is built into the wall Several Greek inscriptions occur among these ruins. Foxes, wolves, and the Syrian bear are commonly found on Hermon, with various kinds of game. In the 12th century Psalm Ixxxix. 12 was supposed to indicate the proximity of Hermon to Tabor. The conical hill immediately south of Tabor was thus named Little Hermon, and is still so called by some of the inhabitants of the district.
