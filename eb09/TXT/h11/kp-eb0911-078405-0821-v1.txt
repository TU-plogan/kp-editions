HEYLIN, Peter (1599-1662), an historical and polemical writer, born at Burford, Oxfordshire, 29th November 1599, was the second son of Henry Heylin, gentleman, who belonged to an old Montgomeryshire family. Being of a studious turn of mind, Heylin was entered at Hart Hall, Oxford, in 1613; was of Magdal en College, 1615; B. A., July 1617; M.A., 1620; B.D., 1629; D.D., 1633. In July [9:11:785] 1618 he began to read college lectures on cosmography (f.e., geography) with such acceptance that his associates made him fellow of Magdalen. The lectures, under the title of Microcosmos, were published in 1621; and many editions of this useful book, each somewhat enlarged, subsequently appeared, until scarcely any scholar’s library was without a copy. In 1625 he published his observations on a journey to France. This book—which was frequently reprinted— Southey termed “one of our liveliest books of travel in its lighter parts, and one of the wisest and most replete with information that was ever written by a young man.” After obtaining the patronage of Laud, whose life he wrote, Heylin was made chaplain to Charles I. His legendary and learned History of St George of Cappadocia procured for him the rectory of Hemmingford, Hunts; his hearty attachment to the High-Anglican party brought many other preferments; and his analysis of Prynne’s Histriomastix was rewarded by the rectory of Islip. He was also made a prebendary of Westminster (9th November 1631), treasurer to the chapter (1637), and subsequently sub-dean. Here he was the bitter opponent of the rule of Bishop Williams, the commendatory dean. With great ardour Heylin entered into the religious controversies which preceded the war, being equally hostile to the Puritan element within and without the church. He was consequently singled out for punishment by the committees of the Long Parliament, who deprived him of benefices worth £800, and heavily fined him. An amusing anecdote he tells affords proof of his unpopularity in London, and at the same time shows how his Cosmography was appreciated. As he passed along the street a fellow “shouldered” him with the remark, “Geography is better than Divinity.” For seven years, he says, Ins name was in almost every libel. He retired to his Hampshire parsonage of Alresford until Waller’s army disturbed him. Robbed there of his library, valued at £1000, and his property, he went to Oxford, where from 1st June 1643 he edited Mercurius Aulicus, a vivacious but virulent news-sheet which greatly annoyed the Parliamentarians. His Extraneus Vapulans, written against L’Estrange (who wittily retorted that a prelate should be “no striker”), refers to his sufferings and hardships. The . necessary quiet for his literary pursuits was ultimately found at Lacy’s Court, Abingdon, whence were dated several books and pamphlets against those of his own communion whose opinions were not as unyielding as his, as also against the Presbyterians and others, controversies in which Ussher, Fuller, Baxter, and Harrington were concerned. His works, all more or less marred by political or theological rancour, were upwards of fifty in number; and they comprise histories of Episcopacy, of the Reformation, and of the Presbyterians, with a useful Help to English History. Some verses of merit also came from his active pen; and his poetical memorial of Bishop Waynflete was published by the Caxton Society in 1851. Heylin was a diligent writer and investigator, a good ecclesiastical lawyer, and had his learning always at command. His principles, to which he was honestly attached, were defended with ability; but his efforts to uphold the church passed unrecognized at the Restoration. His sight began to fail him; yet he rejoiced that his “old bad eyes” had seen the king’s return. Upon that event he preached a jubilant sermon in Westminster Abbey to a great audience, 29th May 1661. He died on 8th May in the following year, and was buried two days after under his sub-dean’s seat.

Lives of Heylin were written by Dr John Barnard, his son-in-law, and by George Vernon. Barnard’s work was very carefully reprinted, with notes, in the History of the Reformation, published, 1849, by the Ecclesiastical History Society.
