HEAD, Sir Francis Bond, Bart. (1793-1875), soldier, traveller, and author, son of James Roper Head of the Hermitage, Kent, was born there January 1, 1793. He served with the Royal Engineers at the battle3 of Waterloo and Fleurus, and when he retired from the army he had risen to the rank of major. In 1825 he accepted the charge of an association formed to work the gold and silver mines of Rio de la Plata. In connexion with this enterprise he made several rapid journeys across the Pampas and among the Andes, his Hough Notes of which, published in 1826, and written in a clear and spirited style, obtained for him the name of “Galloping Head.” In 1835 he was appointed governor of Upper Canada, where he manifested similar energy in dealing with the discontents from wLich the colony was at that time suffering. He resigned his office in 1837, and in recognition of his services he was in 1838 created a baronet. The narrative of his administration in Upper Canada was published by him in 1839. In 1867 he became a privy councillor. He died at his residence at Croydon, July 20, 1875. Some time previously a pension of £100 per annum was conferred upon him for his “services to literature.”

Sir Francis Head was the author of a considerable number of works, chiefly of travel, written in a clever, amusing, and graphic fashion, and displaying both acute observation and genial humour. Besides those already mentioned, his principal works, which have all gone through more than one edition, are Bubbles from the Brunnen of Nassau, 1833; Life of Bruce, 1844; The Emigrant, 1846; Stokers and Pokers, 1850; The Defenceless State of Great Britain, 1850; A Faggot of French Sticks, 1851; A Fortnight in Ireland, 1852; Descriptive Essays, 1856; The Horse and his Rider, 1860; The Royal Engineer, 1870.
