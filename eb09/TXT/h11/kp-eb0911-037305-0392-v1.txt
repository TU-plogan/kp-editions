HAIDINGER, Wilhelm von (1795-1871), a mineralogist, geologist, and physicist of considerable note, was born at Vienna, February 5, 1795. His father, Karl Haidinger, contributed largely to the development of mineralogical science in the latter half of the last century. Having studied at the normal school of St Anne, and attended classes at the university, Wilhelm, at the age of seventeen, joined Professor Mohs at Gratz, and five years later accompanied the professor to Freiberg on the transfer of his labours to the mining academy of that Saxon ElDorado. In 1822 Haidinger visited France and England with Count Breunner, and, journeying northward, took up his abode in Edinburgh. He translated into English, with additions of his own. Mohs’s Grundriss der Mineralogie, published at Edinburgh in three volumes under the title Treatise cη Mineralogy, 1825. After a tour in northern [9:11:374] Europe, including the Scandinavian mining districts, he undertook the scientific direction of the porcelain works at Elnbogen, belonging to his brothers. In 1840 he was appointed counsellor of mines (Bergrath) at Vienna in the place of Professor Mohs, a post which included the charge of the imperial cabinet of minerals, &c. He devoted himself to the rearrangement and enrichment of the collections, and the cabinet became the first in Europe. Shortly after (1843) Haidinger commenced a series of lectures on mineralogy, which was given to the world under the title Handbuch der bestimmenden Mineralogie (Vienna, 1845; tables, 184G). On the establishment of the imperial geological institution, he was chosen director (1849); and this important position he occupied for seventeen years. On the completion of the geological survey of the Austrian dominions in 1862, he superintended the preparation of the maps which were issued. He was elected a member of the imperial board of agriculture and mines, and a member of the imperial academy of sciences of Vienna. He organized the society of the friends of natural sciences. As a physicist Haidinger ranked high, and he was one of the most active promoters of scientific progress in Austria. He was the discoverer of the interesting optical appearances which have been called after him “Haidinger’s brushes.” Knighted in 1865, the following year he retired to his estate at Dörnbach near Vienna, where he died March 19, 1871.

In addition to the works already named, Haidinger published Anfangsgründe der Mineralogie, Leipsic, 1829; Bericht über die Mineralien-Sammlung der K.K. Hofkammer im Münz-und Bergwesen, Vienna, 1843; Geognostische Uebersichtskarte der Oesterreich. Monarchie, Vienna, 1847; Ucbcr den Zusammenhang der Körperfarben und der Oberflächenfarben, Vienna, 1852; Bemerkungen über die Anordnung cler kleinsten Theilchen in Christallen, Vienna 1853; Niedrigste Höhe von Geioitterwolken, Vienna, 1853; Interferenzlinien am Glimmer, Vienna, 1855; Vergleichungen von Augit und Amphibol, Vienna, 1855; Die konische Refraction am Diopsid, Vienna, 1855. He also edited the Naturwissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, Vienna, 1847; the Berichte über die Mittheilungen von Freunden der Naturwissenschaften in Wien, Vienna, 1847-51; and the Jahrbuch of the Vienna K. K. Geologische Reichanstalt, 1850, &c. Some of his papers will be found in C ∖∖ e Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (vol. x.) and of the Wernerian Society (1822- 23), Edinburgh Phil. Journal, Brewster's Journal of Science, and Poggcndorffs Annalen.
