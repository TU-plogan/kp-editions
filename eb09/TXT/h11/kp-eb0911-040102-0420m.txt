HAM, a small town of France, in a marshy district on the left bank of the Somme, about 40 miles south-east of Amiens, on the railway between Amiens and Rheims. It had in 1876 a population of only 3122; but historically it is a place of very considerable importance. From the 9th century onwards it appears as the seat of a lordship which, after the extinction of its hereditary line, passed in succession to the houses of Coucy, Enghien, Luxembourg, Rohan, Vendôme, and Navarre, and was finally united to the French crown on the accession of Henry IV. In 1108 an abbey of canons regular of the congregation of France was founded at Ham; and it continued to exist till the great Revolution, the revenue of its abbot about that time amounting to 15,000 livres. The abbey church (Notre Dame) dates from the 12th century, but in April 1760 all the inflammable portions of the buildiug were destroyed by a conflagration caused by lightning, and during the present century a process of restoration has been carried out under the direction of M. Corroyer. Of special note are the bas reliefs of the nave and choir, executed in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the crypt of the 11th century, which contains the sepulchral effigies of Odo of Ham and his wife Isabella of Béthencourt. The castle, founded by Odo in the 12th century, was rebuilt in the 13th and extended in the 14th, and its present appearance is mainly due to Louis of Luxembourg, count of St Pol, who between 1436 and 1470 not only furnished it with outworks, but gave such a thickness to the towers and curtains, and more especially to the great tower or donjon which still bears his motto Mon Myeux, that they would offer a long resistance even to modern artillery (Viollet-le-Duc). It forms a rectangle 395 feet long by 263 feet broad, with a round tower at each angle and two square towers protecting the curtains. The eastern and western sides are each defended by a demi lune. The Constable’s Tower, for so the great tower is usually called in memory of St Pol, has a height of about 100 feet, and the thickness of the walls is 36 feet; the interior is occupied by three large hexagonal chambers in as many stories. As the castle of Ham has frequently been used as a state prison both in ancient and modern times, the list of those who have tasted its hospitality is an interesting one, including Joan of Arc, Louis of Bourbon, the ministers of Charles X., Louis Napoleon, Cavaignac, and Lamoricière. Louis Napoleon was there for six years, and at last effected his escape in the disguise of a workman. During 1870-71 Ham was several times captured and recaptured by the belligerents.

A view and plan of the town will be found in Caspar Merian’s Tοpοgrαphiα Gallice, Frankfort, 1656; and the former is copied in the Gentleman's Magazine, 1831. See also De Feuillide, Le Château de Ham, 1842; and Ch. Gomart, Ham, son château, 1864.
