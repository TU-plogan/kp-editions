HACO V., surnamed the Old, king of Norway, son of Haco IV., was on the death of his father in 1204 excluded from the throne on the ground of supposed illegitimacy, and only become kingin 1223, after his mother, to establish his rights, had undergone the ordeal of fire. He greatly increased the prosperity of Norway, and he also added to his kingdom Iceland and Greenland. As he had a dispute with Alexander III. of Scotland in regard to the sovereignty of the Hebrides, he set sail about 1263 on a great expedition against the west of Scotland, where he took possession· of Arran and Bute, but suffered such a severe defeat at Largs that he was compelled again to put to sea. After losing many ships by storm, he sailed to Orkney, where ho died in the following winter. It is supposed by some that his fleet in his voyage north passed between Skye and the mainland, and that it is from this fact that the narrow sound of Kyle-Akin received its name.

For the kings named Haco see the Hcimskringlα of Snorro Sturluson, which, however, does not include the reign of Haco V., translated into English by Samuel Laing, London, 1844. The saga of Swerre and his successors was published by Unger under the title Konunga Sögur, Christiania, 1870-73. The Saga Hdkonar Hàkonarsonar forms the 10th vol. of the Fornmanna Sögur published at Copenhagen in 12 vols., 1825-39, and translated into Danish and Latin in 12 vols., 1828-40. See also Sturlunga Saga, 2 vols., Oxford, 1878, and Carlyle’s Early Kings of Norway f London, 1875.
