HALLECK, Fitzgreene (1790-1867), an American poet, was born at Guildford, Connecticut, July 8, 1790. By his mother he was descended from John Eliot, the “Apostle of the Indians.” At an early age he became clerk in a store at Guildford, and at eighteen he entered a banking-house in New York. Having made the acquaintance of Joseph Rodman Drake in 1819, he assisted him under the signature of “Croaker junior” in contributing to the Hew York Evening Post the humorous series of “Croaker Papers.” In 1821 he published his longest poem, Fanny, a satire on local politics and fashions in the measure of Byron’s Don Juan. He visited Europe in 1822-23, and after his return published anonymously in 1827 a volume of poems in which were included “Alnwick Castle” and “Burns.” From 1824 to 1849 he was confidential agent of John Jacob Astor, who named him one of the trustees of the Astor Library, and left him an annuity of 200 dollars, on which he retired to Guildford, where he lived with an unmarried sister. In 1864 he published in the Hew York Ledger a poem of 300 lines entitled “Young America.” He died at Guildford, November 19, 1867. The poems of Halleck are written with great care and finish, and manifest the possession of a fine sense of harmony and of genial and elevated sentiments.

Editions of his poems appeared in 1836, 1842, 1849, 1858, and 1860. He is also the author of an edition of Byron with notes and a memoir, and of two volumes of Selections from the British Bocts. His Life, by J. G. Wilson, appeared in 1869.
