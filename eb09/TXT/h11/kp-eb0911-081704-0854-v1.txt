HILL, Rowland (1744-1833), an eccentric and popular English preacher, sixth son of Sir Rowland Hill of Hawkstone, was born there 23d August 1744. After receiving his early education at the grammar school of Shrewsbury and at Eton, he in 1764 entered St John’s College, Cambridge. While at the university he made the acquaintance of the Methodist preacher Whitfield, and stimulated by his example he somewhat scandalized the university authorities and his own friends by preaching, before he had obtained holy orders, in the surrounding villages, and conducting religious services in the houses of the sick and poor. After graduating with distinction he took orders, and in 1773 was appointed to the parish of Kingston, Somersetshire, where he began to indulge his favourite taste for open air preaching, and soon attracted great crowds to the services which he held nearly every day of the week. Having on the death of his father in 1780 inherited considerable property, he built for his own use Surrey Chapel, in the Blackfriars Road, London. The chapel was opened on the 8th June 1783. Though now practically occupying the ecclesiastical position of a dissenter, Hill conducted hie [9:11:818] services in accordance with the forms of the Church of England, in whose communion he always remained. From the beginning his success was complete, and his chapel soon came to be filled with an audience such as no other preacher in London could boast. During the summer months he made what he called “gospel-tours” into all parts of the country, sometimes extending them to Scotland and Ireland, and attracted wherever he went audiences as numerous and as interested as those which had crowded to hear Whitfield. After these tours he always returned with increased enthusiasm to his duties at Surrey Chapel, where he continued to officiate almost to the day of his death, 11th April 1833. The oratory of Rowland Hill, like that of Whitfield, was specially adapted for rude and uncultivated audiences, and it was equally effective although by more varied means. He possessed a voice of great power, and, according to Southey, “his manner” was “that of a performer as great in his own line as Kean or Kemble.” Not unfrequently he violated the laws of good taste in the eccentricities of his wit and humour, but the intensity and purity of the purpose by which he was actuated enabled him always to retain uninjured his moral influence over his audience. Among the various publications of Rowland Hill the best known is his Village Dialogues, which first appeared in 1810, and reached a 34th edition in 1839.
