HAGEN, Friedrich Heinrich von der (1780-1856), distinguished for his researches in Old German literature, was born at Schmiedeberg in Brandenburg, 19th February 1780. After studying law at the university of Halle, he obtained a legal appointment in the state service at Berlin, but in 1806 he resigned this office in order to devote himself exclusively to the study of his choice. In 1810 he was appointed professor extraordinarius of German language and literature in the university of Berlin, in the following year was transferred to a similar professorship in Breslau, and in 1821 returned to Berlin as professor ordinarius. He died at Berlin, 11th June 1856. To Hagen belongs the chief merit of awakening an interest in Old German poetry, of which he published several collections.

His principal publications are the Nibelungenlied, of which he issued four editions, the first in 1810 and the last in 1842; the Minnesinger, Leipsic, 1838-52, 5 vols.; Lieder der altern Edda, Berlin, 1812; Altnordische Lieder und Sagen, Breslau, 1814; a collection of Old German tales under the title Gcsammtabenteuer, Stuttgart, 1850, 3 vols. He also published Ueber die ältesten Darstellungen der Faustsage, Berlin, 1844; and from 1835 he edited the Jahrbuch der Berlinischen Gesellschaft fur deutsche Sprache und A lterthumskunde.
