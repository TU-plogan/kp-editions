HELOTS, in Grecian antiquity, were the serfs or bondsmen of the Spartans. The most probable of the various explanations of their origin seems to be that they were the early aborigines of Laconia, who at the time of the Dorian invasion were reduced to slavery by the conquerors. The name is perhaps best derived from the root ∈λ, found in eλeιv, 77λωv, and other words. The Helots were the lowest class of the inhabitants of Sparta; but those of them who were emancipated formed the class of Neodamodes i next in political rights to the Spartan citizens themselves. The Molhones or Mothahes were domestic slaves who had been brought up along with the young Spartans, and afterwards liberated. The Helots were the property of the state, which alone had the right of emancipating them, although it made over their services to individuals. They were attached to the soil— adscriptiglel>ce— and could not be sold away from it. They tilled the land which was allocated to them in the proportion of one lot to several families; and for each lot they paid to their masters an annual rent of 82 medimni of barley, and a quantity of wine and oil. They were also employed on public works, and performed all domestic service. In time of war the Helots generally served as light-armed troops; but when on special emergencies they fought as ho}dites, they were usually rewarded with theit freedom. The first occurrence of this kind was under Brasidas in 424 b.c. In the fleet the great bulk of the sailors were Helots. Although every care was taken to distinguish the serf from his lord, even in the matter of dress, the accounts of the cruel treatment of the Helots by the Spartans only hold true of the later history of Lacedaemon. The condition of the Helot was better than that of a slave in other Greek states, for, being a serf of the soil, he was not wholly at the mercy of his master, and there was a legal way whereby, after many stages, he could eventually attain freedom and citizenship. After the Messenian w ar, however, when the multitude of the Helots made them formidable to the diminished numbers of the full citizens, there is no doubt that very cruel measures were adopted against them. The evidence is strong that the Crypteia, instituted ostensibly to inure the Spartan youth to hardship, was really intended to reduce the number of the Helots by assassination; and we know from Thucydides (iv. 80) that on one occasion 2000 Helots were treacherously massacred by the Spartan citizens. At the close of the second Messenian war (668 b.c.), the conquered Messenians were classed with and treated as the Helots, till Epaminondas restored them to their native country after the battle of Leuctra (371 B.C.).
