HAMILTON, a city of Canada, the chief town in the county of Wentworth, province of Ontario, is advantageously situated on the south side of Burlington Bay, a large and beautiful basin of water connected with Lake Ontario by a short canal, which forms one of the safest and most commodious harbours on the lake. It is also connected with the town of Dundas by the Desjardins Canal, about 4 miles in length. Hamilton holds an important position at the head of the navigation on Lake Ontario, and in the centre of one of the finest agricultural districts of the Dominion. It is the headquarters of the Great Western Railroad, and is connected by other lines of railway with Lake Erie, Lake Huron, and the Georgian Bay. The site on which it is built rises gradually from the bay to the foot of a lofty bluff called “The Mountain,” the summit of which commands an extensive and beautiful view. The streets are well laid out, and planted with shade trees, and the houses and public buildings are substantially constructed of stone and brick. The court-house and county buildings, recently completed, are the finest in Canada. Among the other public buildings are the provincial lunatic asylum, the Anglican and Roman Catholic cathedrals, and handsome places of worship of other denominations, the collegiate institute, the Wesleyan female college, the mechanics’ institute, the banks, the city hospital, and other charitable institutions. The city water-works, by means of which a constant supply of pure water is brought from Lake Ontario, have been completed on a scale amply providing for the future growth of the city, at a cost of about $1,000,000. The industries, include iron rolling mills, iron foundries, the manufacture of agricultural implements, sewing machines, musical instruments, carriages, glass, pottery, <kc., tobacco manufacture, and brushmaking. The total value of imports at the port of Hamilton for the fiscal year 1878-9 was $3,992,123; and the duty collected amounted to $839,153. The total tonnage entered at the port was 160,666 tons; but this is exclusive of a much larger amount of goodä brought by railway, including foreign importations, on which the duty has already been paid at Quebec or Montreal, and of which therefore no entry is made. Daily lines of steamers run in the summer months between Hamilton, Toronto, Kingston,, and Montreal; and an extensive trade is carried on with the maritime provinces. Hamilton was founded in 1813,. and incorporated in 1833. The population in 1836 was 2846; in 1851, 10,248; in 1861,19,096; in 1871, 26,716; and in 1879 it is estimated at 35,000. It is the seat of the Anglican bishop of Niagara, and of a Roman Catholic bishop. It returns one member to the provincial parliament of Ontario, and two members to the Dominion parliament, or House of Commons.
