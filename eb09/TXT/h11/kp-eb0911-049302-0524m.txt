HARRIS, James (1709-1780), a distinguished English writer on the subject of grammar, was born at Salisbury on the 20th of July 1709. He received his early education at Salisbury, whence he was removed to Oxford at the age of sixteen; and, having passed the usual number of years as a gentleman commoner at Wadham College, he was entered at Lincoln’s Inn as a student of law, though not intended for the bar. When he had attained his twentyfourth year his father died; and this event, having at once freed him from all control, and placed him in the possession of an independent fortune, enabled him to exchange the study of law for other pursuits more congenial to his taste. The decided bent of his mind had always been towards the Greek and Latin classics; and to the study of these he now applied himself with unremitting assiduity during a period of fourteen or fifteen years. The first fruit of this lengthened course of application was a volume which he published in 1744, containing three treatises—one on art, another on music, painting, and poetry, and a third on happiness. In 1751 appeared the work by which he is best known, Hermes, a philosophical inquiry concerning universal grammar. Although Hermes had considerable reputation in its day as a treatise on grammar, it must now be regarded as antiquated, and even as erroneous in conception. It is not so much a work on grammar as an attempt to force upon grammatical forms a strictly logical significance, to discover the groundwork of all grammars by analysing the thoughts to be expressed in words. This method, as we now recognize, is incapable of throwing light upon the oral structure and growth of language and grammatical forms. In 1775 Harris published his Philosophical Arrangements, part of a larger work which he had meditated, but did not complete, on the peripatetic logic. It is in fact a commentary on Aristotle’s categories, and an attempt to discuss problems of more recent philosophy by the Aristotelian notions. The Philological Inquiries is a pleasantly written but slight work on the principles of literary criticism and style. It is the least pedantic of all his works. Harris died in December 1780. His works were collected and published in 2 vols., 1801, by his son, Lord Malmesbury, who prefixed a brief biography.
