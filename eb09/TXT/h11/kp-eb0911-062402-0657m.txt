HEILBRONN, a town of Würtemberg, in the circle of the Neckar, is situated in a pleasant and fruitful valley on the Neckar, and at the junction of several railways, 26 miles N. of Stuttgart. It is the seat of a circle court, a jury court, a superior tribunal, a head tax office, and a chamber of commerce. In the older part of the town the streets are narrow, and it contains a number of high turreted houses with quaintly adorned gables. The old fortifications have now been demolished, and their site is occupied by promenades, outside of which are the more modern parts of the town with wide streets and many handsome buildings. The principal public buildings are the church of St Kilian, in the Gothic and Renaissance styles, begun in 1019 and completed in 1529, with an elegant tower 210 feet high, a beautiful choir, and a finely carved altar; the town-house, founded in 1540, and possessing a collection of interesting documents; the house of the Teutonic knights, now used as barracks; the Catholic church of St Joseph; the tower on the Neckar, in which Götz von Berlichingen was confined in 1525; the synagogue, the prison, and the hospital. The educational establishments include a gymnasium, a real-school of the second order, an agricultural school, and a female school of industry. The town in a commercial point of view is the most important in Würtemberg, and possesses an immense variety of manufactures, of which the principal are gold, silver, steel, and iron wares, machines, sugar of lead, white lead, vinegar, beer, eau de Cologne, sugar, tobacco, soap, oil, cement, sulphuric acid, tartaric acid, artificial manure, glue, soda, tapestry, thread, and cloth. Grapes, fruit, vegetables, and flowering shrubs are largely grown in the neighbourhood, and there are large quarries for sandstone and gypsum. By means of the Neckar a considerable trade is carried on in wood, bark, leather, agricultural produce, fruit, and cattle. The population in 1875 was 21,209.

Heilbronn occupies the site of an old Roman settlement. Its name—originally Heiligbronn or holy spring—was bestowed on it by Charlemagne from a spring of water which until 1857 was to be seen issuing from under the high altar of the church of St Kilian. In 1225 Heilbronn became a free imperial city. It was frequently besieged during the Middle Ages, and it suffered greatly during the Peasants’ War, the Thirty Years’ War, and the various wars with France. In 1803 it came into the possession of Würtemberg.
