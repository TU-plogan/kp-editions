HIEROCLES, a Roman proconsul, first of Bithynia and afterwards of Alexandria, flourished during the reign of Diocletian (284-305 a.d.), and is said to have been the instigator of the fierce persecution of the Christians under Galerius Caesar in 303. He was a man of considerable intellectual culture, and wrote a work entitled λόγοι φιλaληθeις προς τoi>ς Χριστιανούς in two books, in which he endeavoured to persuade the Christians that their sacred books were full of contradictions, and that in moral influence and miraculous power Christ was inferior to Apollonius of Tyana. For our knowledge of the nature of this treatise, which has not come down to our times, we are dependent on Lactantius (Lnstit. Div., ν. 2), and still more on Eusebius, who is the author of a refutation entitled αντιρρητικός προς τa iepoκλιoυς.
