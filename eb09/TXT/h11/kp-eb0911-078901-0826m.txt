HICKES, George (1642-1715), a learned English divine of the nonjuring party, and an eminent Anglo-Saxon scholar, was born at Newsham near Thirsk, Yorkshire, on June 20, 1642. In 1659 he entered St John’s College, Oxford, whence after the Restoration he removed first to Magdalen College and subsequently to Magdalen Hall. In 1664 he was chosen fellow of Lincoln College, and in the following year proceeded Μ. A. On his return from a Continental tour in 1673 he graduated in divinity, and in 1675 he was appointed rector of St Ebbe’s, Oxford; in the following year he as private chaplain accompanied the duke of Lauderdale, the royal commissioner, to Scotland; and shortly afterwards he received the degree of D.D. from the university of Glasgow. In 1680 he became vicar of All Hallows, Barking, London; and after having been made chaplain to the king in 1681, he was in 1683 promoted to the deanery of Worcester. At the revolution of 1688, having declined to take the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, he was first suspended and afterwards deprived,— he meanwhile affixing to the cathedral doors a “protestation and claim of right” that he was, and still did “continue to be, the only rightful and legal dean of this cathedral church of Worcester.” After remaining some time in concealment in London, he was employed by San croft and the other nonjurors on a mission to the Continent on matters connected with the proposed action of his party relative to the continuance of their episcopal succession; upon his return he was himself consecrated by Lloyd, White, and [9:11:790] Turner suffragan bishop of Thetford in 1694. His later years were largely occupied in controversies the interest of which has now almost wholly passed away; but to them we owe the two works which constitute his chief claim to an enduring reputation, the learned Institutiones Grammaticae Anglo-Saxonicoe et Moeso-Gothicae (1689), and Linguarum veterum Septentrionalium Thesaurus grarnmatico-cmticus et archoeologicus (1703-1705). In 1713 he united with Bishops Campbell and Gadderar to consecrate Jeremy Collier, Samuel Hawes, and Nathaniel Spinkes to be bishops in the nonjuring church. He died December 15, 1715.

Even apart from the two works already mentioned, Hickes was a very voluminous and laborious author. His earliest performances, which were anonymous, were suggested by contemporary events in Scotland that gave him great satisfaction,—the execution of Mitchel on a charge of having been implicated in the murder of Archbishop Sharp, and that of Kid and King, Presbyterian ministers, “for high treason and rebellion” (Rαvillαc Redivivus, 1678; The Spirit of Popery speaking out of the Mouths of Phanq,tical Protestants, 1680). In his Jovian (an answer to Johnson’s Julian the Apostate, 1683), he endeavoured to show that the Roman empire was not hereditary, and that the Christians under Julian had recognized the duty of passive obedience. His Two Treatises, one “On the Christian Priesthood” and the other “On the Dignity of the Episcopal Order,” originally published in 1707, have been more than once reprinted, and form three volumes of the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology (1817). In 1705 and 1710 were published Collectioris of Controversial Letters, in 1711 a collection of Sermons, and in 1726 a volume of Posthumous Discourses. Other treatises, such as the Apologetical Vindication of the Church of England, are to be met with in Gibson’s Preservative against Popery.
