HÂJÎPUR, a municipal town in Muzaffarpur district, Bengal, situated on the east bank of the Gandak, a short distance above its confluence with the Ganges opposite Patnâ, 25° 40' 50" N. lat., 85° 14' 24" E. long. It is said to have been founded about 500 years ago by one Hâji Ilyâs, the supposed ramparts of whose fort, enclosing an area of 360 bighds f are still visible. Hâjipur figures conspicuously in the history of the struggles between Akbar and his rebellious Afghan governors of Bengal, being twice besieged and captured by the imperial troops, in 1572 and again in 1574. Its command of water traffic in three directions makes the town a place of considerable commercial importance. Within the limits of the old fort is a small stone mosque, very plain, but of peculiar architecture, and attributed to Hâji Ilyâs. Two other mosques and a small Hindu and Buddhist temple are in the town or its immediate vicinity. Besides the ordinary courts, the town contains a school, post-office, charitable dispensary, and distillery. The population in 1872 numbered 22,306, of whom 18,765 were Hindus and 3510 Mahometans.
