HEMSTERHUIS, François (1720-1790), writer on aesthetics and moral philosophy, was born at Franeker in Holland in 1720. He received an excellent education from his father, Tiberius Hemsterhuis, noticed below, and completed his studies at the university of Leyden. There undoubtedly he was attracted towards the study of the Platonic philosophy, which exercised the greatest influence both on the form and on the matter of his own writings. He did not, however, devote himself to a learned life after completing his university courses, but entered upon practical affairs, and for many years acted as secretary to the state council of the United Provinces. His interests were mainly philosophical, and partly by direct social intercourse with a few similarly disposed friends, partly by correspondence with philosophical writers of other countries, mainly with Jacobi, he preserved the continuity of his philosophical work. His writings, none of which can be described as of high speculative worth, are distinguished by elegance of form and by the touch of refined sentiment which is notuncommon among the amateur or dilettante philosophers of the 18th century. Any direct contributions to philosophy made by him are in the department of aesthetics or the general analysis of feeling. He died in 1790.

His first work, published in 1769, was a Lettre sur la Sculpture, written, like all the others, in French. It was followed in 1770 by the Lettre sur les désirs, in 1772 by the Lettre sur l'homme et ses rapports, in 1778 by Sophyle, a dialogue on the relation between soul and body, in 1779 by Aristée, a dialogue on the existence of the Divine Being, in 1787 by Alexis ou l’âge d’or, by Simon, oudes facultés de l’âme, and by the Lettre de Dioclés à Diotime sur l’ athéisme. Collected editions of his works have been published in 1792 (2 vols. ), and more completely by Meyboom, in 1846-50 (6 vols.). See Grucker, François Hemsterhuis, sa Vic et scs Oeuvres (Paris, 1866).
