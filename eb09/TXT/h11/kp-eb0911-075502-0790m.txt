HEROD PHILIP, son of Herod the Great by Cleopatra of Jerusalem, received the tetrarchate of Ituraea and other districts to the N.E. of the Jordan. He is a different person from the first husband of Herodias, also called Philip by St Mark (vi. 17), and was married to Salome the daughter of Herodias. Philip is described as an excellent ruler, who loved peace, and was careful to maintain justice, and spent his time in his own territories. He was also a builder of cities, one of which was Caesarea Philippi, and another was Bethsaida, which he called Julias. He died after a reign of thirty-seven years; and his dominions were incorporated in the province of Syria.
