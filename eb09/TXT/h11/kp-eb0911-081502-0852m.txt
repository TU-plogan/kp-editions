HILDEGARD (1098-1179), commonly referred to as St Hildegard, abbess, “prophetess,” and a figure of some consequence in the history of mediaeval mysticism, was born of noble parents at Böckheleim in the countship of Sponheim, diocese of Mainz, in 1098 (or 1099), and from her eighth year was educated at the Benedictine cloister of Disiboden-berg (Mons Disibodi) in the principality of Zweibrücken, now in Rhenish Bavaria, where Jutta, sister of the count of Sponheim, was at that time abbess. From earliest childhood, we learn from Hildegard herself, she was accustomed to see visions which increased in frequency and vividness as she approached the age of womanhood; these, however, she for many years, though with great pain, kept almost wholly secret, nor was it until she had reached her forty-third year (1141) that she felt constrained at last to divulge them. Committed to writing by her intimate friend the monk Godefridus, they now form the first and most important of her printed works, entitled Scivias (probably an abbreviation for “sciens vias” or “nosce vias Domini ”) & Visionum et Revelationum Libri ITI. i and completed in 1151. In 1147 St Bernard of Clairvaux, having come to Bingen while engaged in preaching the new crusade throughout Germany, chanced to hear of Hildegard’s revelations, and on inquiry became so convinced of their reality that he not only wrote to her a letter cordially acknowledging her as a prophetess of God, but also successfully advocated her recognition as such by his friend and former pupil Pope Eugenius III. in the synod of Trêves (1148). In the same year Hildegard, who meanwhile had succeeded Jutta as abbess at Disibo-denberg, and had attracted overflowing numbers to that [9:11:816] cloister, migrated along with eighteen of her nuns to a new convent at Rupertsberg near Bingen, over which she pre-eided during the remainder of her life. By means of voluminous correspondence, as well as by extensive journeys, in the course of which she was unwearied in the exercise of her gift of prophecy, she wielded for many years an increasing influence upon her contemporaries,—an influence doubtless due to the fact that she herself was so fully imbued with the most widely diffused feelings and beliefs, fears and hopes, of her time. Amongst her correspondents were Popes Anastasius IV. and Hadrian IV., the emperors Conrad III. and Frederick I., and also the theologian Guibert of Gembloux, who submitted numerous questions in dogmatic for her determination. It deserves to be specially mentioned to her credit that, though zealously opposed to the Catharists, she stood almost alone in maintaining that the image of God ought to be respected even in them, and that therefore they ought not to be killed. She died in 1179, but has never been canonized; her name, however, was received into the Roman martyrology in the 15th century, September 17th being the day fixed for her commemoration. Her biography, which was written by two contemporaries, Godefridus and Theodoricus, was first printed at Cologne in 1566, and has frequently been reproduced in various forms since that date.

The works of Hildegard, in. addition to the Scivias already mentioned, include Divinorum operum simplicis hominis liber, a hitherto unpublished treatise containing later visions and revelations, many of them relating to physical and medical questions; Vitae meritorum, also unpublished; Lives of St Rupert and St Disibod; Expositions of the rule of St Benedict, and of the Athanasiancreed; Letters, and Exhortations. While her ‘ t visions” on such themes of the Christian religion as God and His kingdom, the church and its mystical union to Christ, must be regarded as crude and extravagant even to insanity, it is impossible to deny all ethical or religious value to her earnest denunciations of the corruptions of the clergy and mendicant orders, or to the intense expressions (however ignorant and imperfect) of the life-long aspirations of a mind so singularly unselfish and unworldly as hers. The Scivias were printed in 1513 and again in 1628. The Epistolarum Liber (first published in 1566) appears with some other Opuscula in the Max. Bibl. Vet. Patr., vol. xxiii., and in Martene and Durand’s Amplissima Collectio, vol. ii. The Opera Omnia form vol. cxcvii. of Migne’s Patrologiae Cursus Completus.
