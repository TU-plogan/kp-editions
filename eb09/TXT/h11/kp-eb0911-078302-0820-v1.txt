HEUGLIN, Theodor von (1824-1876), an eminent African and Arctic traveller, was born 20th March 1824 at Hirschlanden near Leonberg in Wurtemberg, and died at Stuttgart, 5th November 1876. His father was a Protestant pastor, and he was originally trained to be a mining engineer, but his own early ambition was to contribute to scientific progress by his personal explorations, and he prepared himself for his task by careful and multifarious discipline, studying the natural sciences, and more particularly zoology, acquiring the more serviceable of the modern languages, strengthening his physique by gymnastic exercises, and learning to use with equal skill his pencil and his gun. Supplied with funds by his mother’s liberality, Heuglin went to Egypt in 1851, and till 1865 the northeastern regions of Africa were the main scene of his labours. In 1852 he accompanied Dr Reitz, the Austrian consul at Khartum, in his fatal journey to Abyssinia; in 1853, having been appointed Dr Reitz’s successor in the consulate, he visited Kordofan and the lower course of the White Nile; and in 1857, on his return after about two years’ absence in Europe, he was commissioned by the grand-duke Ferdinand Maximilian of Austria to explore the countries along the west coast of the Red Sea. From the latter part of 1858 to the latter part of 1860 he was again in Europe; but in 1861 he was placed at the head of the Vogel search expedition, which included Munzinger, Steudner, Kinzelbach, <fcc., and was expected to make its way to Wadai. Having reached Mai-schecha, however, the explorers broke up into three parties, Heuglin turning along with Steudner and Schubert in the direction of Adoa, Gondar, and the Galla lands. At Khartum they joined Miss Tinne’s party, and proceeded to Lake Rey and the Kosanga river, but Steudner died on 10th April 1863, and Heuglin was compelled by sickness to retrace his steps. He returned to Europe in 1865. In 1870 and 1871 he made a valuable series of explorations in Spitzbergen and Novaya Zemlya; but 1875 found him again in North-East Africa, in the country of the Beni Amer and Habab. An invitation from the khedive took him abroad again in 1876, but receiving no definite appointment he returned to Europe. Later in the same year he was engaged in preparing for an exploration of the island of Socotra, when he was suddenly carried off by inflammation of the lungs. He was buried beside Mauch, the African traveller, and a statue has been erected over his grave.

His principal works are Systematische Uebersicht der Vögel Nordost· Africa's, 1855; Reisen in Nordist-Afrika, 1852-1853 (Gotha, 1857); Syst. Uebersicht der Säugcthiere Nordost·Afrika' s (Vienna, 1867); Reise nach Abessinien, den Galla-Ländern, &c., 1861-62 (Jena,

1868); Reise in das Gebiet des Weissen Nil, 1862-1864 (Leipsic,

1869); Reisen nach dem Nordpolarmeer, 1870-71 (Brunswick, 1872- 74); Ornithologie von Nordost-Afrika s (Cassel, 1869-75); Reise in Nordost-Afrika (Brunswick, 1877, 2 vols.). It is principally by his zoological, and more especially his ornithological, labours that Heuglin has taken rank as an independent authority. A list of the more important of his numerous contributions to Petermann’s Mittheilungen will be found in that serial for 1877 at the close of the necrological notice.
