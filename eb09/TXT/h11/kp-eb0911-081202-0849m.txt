HILARIUS, or Hilarus(Hilary), bishop of Rome from 461 to 467, who according to some authorities had attained to the archidiaconate as early as the year 417, is known to have been a deacon and to have acted as legate of Leo the Great at the “robber” synod of Ephesus in 449. There he so vigorously defended the conduct of Flavian in deposing Eutyches that he was thrown into prison, whence he had great difficulty in making his escape to Rome. Chosen to succeed Leo on November 12, 461, he issued a brief de fide catholica, in which he anathematized Eutyches, Nestorius, and Dioscurus, and reaffirmed the decisions of the councils of Nice, Ephesus, and Chalcedon. In 465 he held at Rome a council which put a stop to some prevalent abuses, particularly to that of bishops appointing their own successors. His pontificate was also marked by a successful encroachment of the papal authority on the metropolitan rights of the French and Spanish hierarchy, and by a resistance to the toleration edict of Anthemius, which ultimately caused it to be recalled. Hilarius, who died November 17, 467, was succeeded by Simplicius.
