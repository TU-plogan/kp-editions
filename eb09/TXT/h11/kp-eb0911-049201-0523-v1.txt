HARRINGTON, James (1611-1677), a distinguished writer on the philosophy of government, was sprung from an old family in Rutlandshire, and was born in January 1611. He received a careful education, and in his eighteenth year entered Trinity College, Oxford, as a gentleman commoner. One of his tutors was the famous Chillingworth. At the close of his university career he set out to travel on the Continent, and proceeded first to Holland, where he spent several years. He served some time in the Dutch army, and enjoyed the friendship both of the prince of Orange and of the queen of Bohemia. After visiting France and Italy, he returned to England and lived in retirement till 1646, when he was named one of the grooms of the bed-chamber to Charles I., who was at that time being conveyed south from Newcastle as prisoner of the parliament. Though republican in his ideas, Harrington secured the confidence and respect of the king, who showed strong personal regard for him. On the removal of Charles to the Isle of Wight, Harrington was prevented from accompanying him, and was for a short time put in confinement because he would not swear to refuse assistance to the king should he attempt to escape. His feelings of respect led him also to accompany Charles to the scaffold in the following year.

After Charles's death Harrington once more withdrew into private life and devoted his time to the composition of his work on the theory of the state, afterwards published under the title of Oceana. The nature of his views was well known, and, as they pleased neither republicans nor royalists, the work was naturally regarded with some suspicion. By order of Cromwell the Oceana was seized when passing through the press. Harrington, however, managed to secure the favour of the Protector’s favourite daughter, Mrs Claypole; the work was restored to him, and appeared in 1656, dedicated to Cromwell. The views embodied in Oceana, particularly that bearing on vote by ballot and rotation of magistrates and legislators, Harrington and otherswho formed a club called the ‘Ro'.a” endeavoured to push practically,’ but with no success. In December 1661, by order of Charles II., Harrington was arrested on a charge of conspiracy, and though there seem to have been no sufficient grounds for the accusation, he was thrown into prison. Despite his repeated request no public trial could be obtained, and when at length he endeavoured to protect himself by claiming the right of habeas corpus, he was secretly removed to a small island off Plymouth. There his health completely gave way, and his mind appeared to be affected. By careful treatment he was restored to bodily vigour, but it is supposed that his mind never recovered its tone. After his release he married,—at what date does not seem to be precisely known. He died September 11, 1677.

Harrington’s books consist of the Oceana, and of papers, pamphlets, aphorisms, even treatises, in support and defence of the Oceana. The Oceana is not a philosophical romance; it is a hard, prolix, and in many respects heavy exposition of a new method for constituting civil society. The details are elaborated with infinite care, even the salaries of officials being computed, but the important or leading ideas in the book are two in number, with two practical precepts following from them. The first is that the determining element of power in a state is property generally, property in land in particular; the second is that the executive power ought not to be vested for any considerable length of time in the hands of the same men or class of men. As practical corollary to his first proposition Harrington recommends an agrarian law, limiting the portion of land held to that yielding a revenue of £2000, and consequently insisting on particular modes of distributing landed pro- {>erty. As a practical maxim following from the second he ays down the rule of rotation by ballot. A third part of the executive, senate, or whatever it might be, are voted out by ballot every year (not being capable of being elected again for three years). Harrington explains very carefully how the state and its governing parts are to be constituted by his scheme, and Oceana undoubtedly contains many valuable ideas. As a book, however, it is irretrievably dull.

His Works were edited by Toland in 1700; Toland’s edition, with additions by Birch, appeared in 1747, and again in 1771.
