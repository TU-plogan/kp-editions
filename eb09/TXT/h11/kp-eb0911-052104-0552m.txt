HAUG, Martin (1827-1876), Orientalist, was born at Ostdorf near Balingen, Würtemberg, January 30, 1827. As a self-taught lad he became a pupil in the gymnasium at Stuttgart at a comparatively late age; and in 1848 he entered the university of Tübingen, where he devoted himself to the study of the Oriental languages, and especially of Sanskrit under Roth. He afterwards for some time attended the lectures of Ewald and Benfey in Göttingen, and finally “habilitated” as a privat-docent at Bonn. In 1856 he removed to Heidelberg as collaborateur in the preparation of Bunsen’s Bibelwerh∙, and in 1859 he accepted an invitation to India, where he became superintendent of Sanskrit studies and professor of Sanskrit in Poona. There [9:11:522] his previous acquaintance with the Zend language and literature enabled him to associate with the Parsees on such terms a3 afforded the best opportunities for perfecting his knowledge in this department. The result of his researches was the volume of Essays on the Sacred Language, Writings, and Religion of the Parsees (Bombay, 1862). After a residence of six years in India, he was compelled by domestic circumstances to return to Würtemberg in 1865; from Stuttgart he was called to Munich as first professor ordinarius of Sanskrit and comparative grammar in 1868. He died at Ragatz in Switzerland on the 3d of June 1876.

Besides the Essays οη the Parsees, of which a new edition, by West, greatly enriched from the posthumous papers of the author, appeared in 1878, Haug published a number of works of considerable importance to the student of the literatures of ancient India and Persia. They include Die Pehlewisprache u. der Buιulekesch (1854); Die Schrift u. Sprache der zweiten Keilschriftgattung (1855); Die fünf Gathas, edited, translated, and expounded (1858-60); an edition with translation and explanation of The Aitarcya Brahmana of the Rigυeda (1863); A Lecture on an original Speech of Zoroaster (1865); An old Zend-Pahlavi Glossary (1867); Ueber den Charakter der Pehlewisprache (1869); Das 18*<≡ Capiteldes Wendidad (1869); Ueber das Ardai-Viraf-nameh (1870); An old Pahlavi-Pazand Glossary (1870); Vedische Räthselfragen u. Räthselspruche (1875).
