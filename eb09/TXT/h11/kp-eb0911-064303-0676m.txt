HELYOT, Pierre (1660-1716), monastic historian, was born at Paris in January 1660, of supposed English descent. After spending his youth in study, he entered in his twentyfourth year the convent of the third order of St Francis, founded at Piepus, near Paris, by his uncle Jérôme Helyot, canon of St Sepulchre. There he took the name of Père Hippolyte. Two journeys to Rome on monastic business afforded him the opportunity of travelling over most of Italy; and after his final return he saw much of France, while acting as secretary to various provincials of his order there. Both in Italy and France he was engaged in collecting materials for his great work, which occupied him about twenty-five years, HHistoire des Ordres Monastiques, Religieux, et Militaires, et des Congregations Séculières, de l’un et de l’autre Sexe, qui ont été établies jusqu’ à présent, published in 8 volumes in 1714-21. Ilelyot died on January 5, 1716, before the fifth volume appeared, but his friend Maximilien Bullot completed the edition. This work, appearing at first anonymously, has been republished several times, and translated into German. Helyot’s only other noteworthy work is Le Chrétien Mourant (1695).
