HADRUMETUM, or Adrumetum (the name appears in the Greek writers in a great variety of forms—Άδρΰ/η?, Άδρυρ,^ς, Άδρυργτος, Αδpoυp,ιττos, Άδράμ,ψ-ος), a city on the African coast of the Mediterranean on the Sinus Neapolitanus or Gulf of Hamamet. A Phoenician colony of earlier date than Carthage, in course of time it became subservient to the imperial city, and fell along with it under the power of the Romans. On the subdivision of the Roman province of Africa Propria, it became the capital of Byzacium. By Trajan it was made a colony, as is evidenced by the grandiloquent inscriptions preserved by Gruter— Coh Concordia Clpia Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrurnetina. From the devastation inflicted by the Vandals it was restored by Justinian, and in consequence it bore for some time the name of Justinianopolis.

The identification of Hadrumetum is a matter of some difficulty. Most modern authorities agree in fixing it at Susa, but others contend that Hamamet is the true site. Hitherto no inscription has been discovered which satisfactorily settles the point in favour of either; for the fragments that are appealed to for the identification of Hamamet with Saigitis may possibly have been brought to the place of their discovery. The arguments in favour of each may be thus summarized. Susa agrees remarkably well, as Maltzan elaborately maintains, with the position assigned to Hadrumetum by the Nοtitiα and other ancient works in which the distances from place to place are given. The remains of ancient buildings, though few, prove undoubtedly that Susa is the site of some city of considerable importance, and the ruins now known as Makluba or the Fallen may be those of a great temple. We know that in the time of El-Bekri Susa still possessed a cothon or inner harbour (one of the chief features of Hadrumetum as described by the author of the African War), which may be recognized in the existing sandy plain 1500 feet wide between the two ancient moles, now distinguished as the Quarantine Mole and Pointe du Mole. The figures found by Μ. Baux {Jοurn. Asiat., 1868) would of themselves have suggested that Susa was a Phoenician colony. Barth suggests that the name Susa is probably a corruption of 2ωζουσa∙ In favour of Hamamet Mr J. E. Davis argues that the scenery near Susa agrees with that of Ruspina described by the author of the African War ; that the absence of ruins at Hamamet is accounted för by the clouds of sand swept down upon the site; that there are clear traces of a cothon at Hamamet; and that the modern name Haimamot or Tent of Death corresponds exactly with the hypothetical Hedermot or Chamber of Death of the Phoenicians. On the whole the argument appears to be on the side of Susa.
