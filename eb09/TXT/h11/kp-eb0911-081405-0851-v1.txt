HILDEBRANDT, Eduard (1817-1868), was born in 1817, and served his term as apprentice to his father, a house-painter at Dantzic. He was not twenty when he came to Berlin, where he was taken in hand by Wilhelm [9:11:815] Krause, a painter of sea-pieces. Like other artists who have earned a name for subtle and rapid execution, he worked at first in a formal, smooth, and timid fashion. Several early pieces exhibited after his death,—a breakwater, dated 1838, ships in a breeze off Swinemiinde (1840), and other canvases of this and the following year,—show Hildebrandt to have been a careful student of nature, with inborn talents kept down by the conventionalisms of the formal school to which Krause belonged. It is difficult to say what the outcome of his art would have been if Hildebrandt had not felt other influences than those of his native schools. Accident made him acquainted with masterpieces of French art displayed at the periodical exhibitions of the Berlin Academy, and these awakened his curiosity and envy. He made up his bundle and wandered to Paris, where, about 1842, he entered the atelier of Isabey and became the companion of Lepoittevin. In a short time he sent home pictures which might have been taken for copies from these artists. Gradually he mastered the tricks of touch and the mysterious secrets of effect in which the French at this period were already so perfect. He also acquired the necessary skill in painting figures, and having done this he returned to Germany, unsurpassable in technical execution, and well skilled in the rendering of many kinds of landscape forms. His pictures of French street life, done about 1843, are impressed with the stamp of the Paris school, but they reveal at the same time a spirit eager for novelty, quick at grasping, equally quick at rendering, momentary changes of tone and atmosphere in varying space and medium. After 1843 Hildebrandt, under the influence of Humboldt, extended his travels, and in 1864-65 he actually went round the world, But whilst his experience became enlarged his powers of concentration broke down. He lost the taste for detail in seeking for scenic breadth, and a fatal facility of hand diminished the value of his works for all those who look for composition and harmony of hue as necessary concomitants of tone and touch. In oil he gradually produced less, in water colours more, than at first, and his fame will probably rest on the sketches which he made in the latter form, many of which are known to the general public by means of chromo-lithography. His course may best be compared to that of a meteor, being breathlessly rapid, brilliant, and charged with colour. No other had the same art of combining elements singly unpicturesque into a picturesque and striking whole, and this chiefly by contrasts of tint and observation of natural phenomena. Fantasies in red, yellow, and opal, sunset, sunrise, and moonshine, distances of hundreds of miles like those of the Andes and the Himalaya, narrow streets in the bazaars of Cairo or Suez, panoramas as seen from mastheads, wide cities like Bombay or Pekin, narrow strips of desert with measureless expanses of sky,—all alike display the bravura of a master who had innumerable admirers in his day on account of this facility, and deserved all the admiration he received, subject to the merited reproach that all these fireworks would have been more satisfactory if combined with deeper meditation on the art of composition and more patient study of detail. Hildebrandt died young at Berlin, on the 25th of October 1868. His pictures are scattered in vast numbers throughout Germany. But good selections are accessible in the royal palaces and in the collections of Borsig, Raabe, and Ravené at Berlin.
