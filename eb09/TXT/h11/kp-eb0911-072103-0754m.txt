HERBERT, Sir Thomas (1606-1682), traveller and author, was born at York in 1606. Several of his ancestors were aidermen and merchants in that city, and they could trace their connexion with the great Herbert family represented by the earl of Pembroke. His grandfather, Aiderman Herbert, who died in 1614, left him real estate of considerable value. He went to Oxford in 1621, and became a commoner of Jesus College, but afterwards removed to Cambridge at the invitation of his mother’s brother, Dr Ambrose Akroyd. Having gone to London, he was introduced to the earl of Pembroke, through whose influence he obtained an appointment in the suite of Sir Dodmore Cotton, who was about to leave as ambassador for Persia in company with Sir Robert Shirley. Sailing in March 1627, they visited the Cape, Madagascar, Goa, and Surat; having landed at Gombroon, they travelled inland to Asharoff, and thence to Cazbeen, where both the chiefs of the expedition died. Herbert reached England again in 1629, and in 1630, to his great disappointment, his patron the earl of Pembroke died suddenly. After this he travelled on the Continent for more than a year. From his return in 1631 till about two years after his marriage in 1632 he retained his ambition for court favour, but failing in this he retired, probably to his estate of Tintern in Monmouthshire, till the outbreak of the civil war, when he sided with the parliament. In 1646 he was appointed to attend the king with his other servants. Becoming a devoted royalist, he continued with his majesty during the last two eventful years of his life, and at the Restoration he was rewarded with the title of baronet (1660). He resided at Westminster till the great plague, when he returned to York and bought Petergate House, where he died on the 1st March 1682.

It was in 1634 that Herbert first published his Description of the Persian Monarchy now bcinge: the Orientali Indyes, Hes and other parts of the Greater Asia and Africk. Four years later a new and enlarged edition appeared under the title of Some Yeares Travels into Africa and Asia the Greed ; a third edition followed in 1661, and a fourth in 1677. The work is evidently the production of a man of considerable scholarship and activity of mind, and altogether ranks as one of the best records of 17th century travel. It is illustrated with woodcuts, among which the sketch of the dodo, the specimen of the cuneiform inscriptions, and the view of Persepolis deserve to be mentioned. Herbert’s Threnodia Carolina, or Memoirs of the two last years of the reign of that unparallelιd prince of ever blessed memory King Charles I., was in great part printed at the author’s request in Wood’s Athenae Oxonicnscs, but it did not appear in its entirety till Dr Charles Goodall published his Collection of Tracts in 1702. A reprint was issued by G. and W. Nicol in 1813. Sir William Dugdale is understood to have received assistance from Herbert in preparing the fourth volume of the Monasticon Anglicanum ; and Mr Drake has printed in the appendix to his Eboracum two papers from Herbert’s pen on the church of St John at Beverley and the collegiate church of Ripon. The best account of Sir Thomas Herbert is that by Robert Davies, F.S.A., York, which appeared in The Yorkshire Archaeological and Topographical Journal, part iii., pp. 182-214 (1870). τ t contains a facsimile of the long inscription on Herbert’s tomb.
