HALL, Joseph (1574-1656), bishop of Norwich, one of the wittiest as well as wisest writers of his century, was born at Bristow Park, parish of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, July 1, 1574. Designed from infancy for the church, he received his early education at the school of his native place, whence in his fifteenth year he passed to Emmanuel College, Cambridge. After being chosen for two years in succession to read the rhetoric lectures in the public schools, l·Iall became a fellow of his college in 1595, and in the following year received the degree of master of arts. Having taken holy orders, he in 1601 became rector of Halstead in Suffolk, near Bury St Edmunds. Two years later he married; and in 1605 he accompanied Sir Edmund Bacon to the Spanish Netherlands. In 1612 Hall was presented to the curacy of Waltham-Holy-Cross, in Essex, and about the same time received the degree of doctor of divinity. Meanwhile his talent3 as a preacher, and the ability shown in his controversial writings, had brought him into notice at court. He was appointed chaplain to Prince Henry and prebendary of Wolverhampton. The latter dignity he soon resigned. In 1616 Hall accompanied the earl of Carlisle on his mission to France, but was compelled by illness to return; in 1617 he went with James I. into Scotland, and in 1618 was appointed by him one of the English deputies to the synod at Dort; but he was again forced by sickness to return before the business, of the assembly was finished. The year before (1617) he had been appointed dean of Worcester. In the years that followed Hall preached frequently before the court and took an active part in the controversies of the day, especially in that between the Arminian and Calvinistic parties in the Church of England, to the latter of which he belonged. In 1624 he refused the see of Gloucester, but in 1627 became bishop of Exeter. In this position, by his toleration of lecturings and his Calvinistic mode of preaching and administering his diocese, he incurred the suspicion of disaffection to episcopacy, and on three occasions appeared on his knees before the king, to answer for his puri-. tanical practices. Hall felt bitterly these undeserved charges of Laud, and threatened to “cast up his rochet” rather than be subject to them. No better proof of his attachment to the Church of England is needed than his Episcopacy by Divine Hight Asserted, written in 1640 at the suggestion of Laud. In 1641 Hall was translated to the see of Norwich. The same year he joined eleven other bishops in presenting to parliament a protest against all laws passed in their enforced absence. Upon this the bishops were accused of high treason and thrown into the Tower. Hall in his Hard Measure relates the trials he underwent both at this time [9:11:390] and afterwards. The accusation fell to the ground, and in six months the bishops were released (June 1642), only,however, on each finding security for £5000. Hall proceeded to Norwich, which he had not yet visited, and set about his pastoral duties; but in April 1643 his revenues and personal property were sequestrated by parliament, a nominal allowance of £400 a year being made for his maintenance. Mrs Hall with great difficulty obtained a fifth of her husband’s property. The bishop was next ejected from his palace, and the cathedral was dismantled. Having retired to a small estate at Higham near Norwich, which he had been able to buy, he there, with his books, bought for him by a friend, spent the rest of his life, writing and preaching “till he was first forbidden by men, and at last disabled by God.” He died 8th September 1656, in his eighty-third year.

The great bulk of Bishop Hall’s writings is controversial, and therefore of comparatively ephemeral interest; but some of them continue to deserve attention. His satires, published under the name of Virgidemiarum Sixe Bookes, consist of three bookes of Toothlesse Satyrs, subdivided into (1) Poetical, (2) Academicall, and (3) Morall, published in 1597, and three bookes of Byting Satyrs, published in 1598. They appeared together in 1599. Hall claims to be the first English satirist, though Hallam disputes his title, and at the same time rather disparages the satires, which have on the other hand been very highly praised by Campbell and Wartom In his Epistles (1608-11) Hall claims to be the introducer of that style of prose composition also into English; but both Ascham and Howell anticipated him. The Contemplations upon the Principal Passages of the History of the New Testament (1612-15), a devout and pious work, one by which perhaps Hall is most generally known, are happily distinguished from most compositions of the class to which they belong by a shy and racy wit which not unfrequently puts the reader in mind of Thomas Fuller. Mundus Alter et Idem, a species of allegorical romance, published in 1643, was translated into English by John Healey, under the title of Discovery of a New World. Other writings of this “English Seneca,” as Sir Henry Wotton called him, are Explication of Hard Texts (1633-34), Christian Meditations (1640), and Henochismus, sive Tractatus de modo ambulandi cum Deo, translated in 1769. An edition of his works was published in 1808 at London, in 10 vols., by the Rev. Josiah Pratt; and a later and better one, in 12 vols., at Oxford (1837-39), by the Rev. Peter Hall. A life of Bishop Hall by the Rev. John Jones appeared in 1826.
