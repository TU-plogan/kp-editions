HARDING, James Duffield (1798-1863), a landscape painter, was the son of an artist, and took to the same vocation at an early age, although he had originally been destined for the law. He was in the main a water-colour painter, but he produced various oil-paintings both at the beginning and towards the end of his career. He frequently contributed to the exhibitions of the Water-Colour Society, of which he became an associate in 1818, and a full member in 1822. He was also very largely engaged in teaching, and published several books developing his views of art,â€”amongst ethers, The Tourist in Italy, 1831; The Tourist in France,, 1834; The Park and the Forest, 1841; The Principles and the Practice of Art, 1845; Elementary Art, 1846; Scotland Delineated in a Series of Views, 1847; Lessons on Art, 1849. He died at Barnes on 4th December 1863. Harding was noted for facility, sureness of hand, nicety of touch, and the various qualities which go to make up an elegant, highly trained, and accomplished sketcher from nature, and composer of picturesque landscape material; he was particularly skilful in the treatment of [9:11:474] foliage, and had for many years a leading position among those landscapists who carry on the miscellaneous work of the art to the satisfaction of their own generation, without establishing an ultimate claim to the higher kind of posthumous renown.
