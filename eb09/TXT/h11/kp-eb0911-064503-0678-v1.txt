HEMINGFORD, or Hemmingford, Walter, a Latin chronicler of the 14th century, was a canon regular of the Austin Priory of Gisborough, now Guisborough, in Yorkshire. Leland calls him Hemengoburgus, and in one of the manuscripts of his chronicle his name appears as Heming-burght. In a document of the priory the name is also given as De Hcmingburgh; and in Gisborough Chartulary mention is made of a neighbouring family of that name. Bale seems to have been the first to give him the name by which he is more commonly known. His chronicle embraces the period of English history from the Conquest (1066) to the nineteenth year of Edward III., with the exception of the latter years of Edward II. It ends with the title of a chapter in which it was proposed to describe the battle of Crecy (1346); but the chronicler seems to have died before the required information reached him. In compiling the first part, Hemingford apparently used the histories of Eadmor, Hoveden, Henry of Huntingdon, and William of Newbury; but the reigns of the three Edwards are original, composed from personal observation and information. There are several manuscripts of the history extant,—the best perhaps being that presented to the College of Arms by the earl of Arundel. The work is correct and judicious, and written in a pleasing style. One of its special features is the preservation in its pages of copies of [9:11:646] the great charters; and Hemingford’s versions have more than once supplied deficiencies and cleared up obscurities in copies from other sources.

The first three books were published by Dr Thomas Gale in 1687, in his Historice Anglicance Scriptores Quinque, and the remainder by Hearne in 1731. The first portion was again published in 1848 by the English Historical Society, under the title Chronicon de Gestis Regum Anglice, edited by H. C. Hamilton.
