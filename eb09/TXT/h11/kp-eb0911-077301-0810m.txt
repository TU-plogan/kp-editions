HERTZ, Henrik (1798-1870), Danish poet, was born of Jewish parents in Copenhagen, August 25, 1798. At that date it was unusual for Jews to enjoy a professional education, but young Hertz showed such marked literary bias that in 1817 he was sent to the university. His father having died in his infancy, and the family property having been destroyed in the bombardment of 1807, the boy was brought up by his relative, M. L. Nathanson, for many years editor of the principal Danish newspaper. Young Hertz was destined for the law, and passed his juridical examination in 1825. But his taste was all for polite literature, and in 1827 he came forward as a dramatic author by the publication of two plays, Herr Burchardt and his Family and Love and Policy ; the latter enjoyed considerable success on the stage. In 1828 followed the comedy of Flyttedagen, which occupied itself with the humours of moving house on quarter-day. In 1830 he brought out what was a complete novelty in Danish literature, a drama in rhymed verse, Amor's Strokes of Genius. In the same year Hertz published anonymously Gjenganger-brevene, or Letters from a Ghost, which he pretended were written by Bιggesen, who had died in 1826, and which were full of satirical humour and fine critical insight. The success of this book was overwhelming; Copenhagen talked of nothing else for a whole season; but Hertz preserved his anonymity, and the secret was not known until many years later. In 1832 he published a didactic poem, Nature and Art, and Four Poetical Epistles. A Day on the Island of Als was his next comedy, followed in 1835 by The Only Fault. Hertz passed through Germany and Switzerland into Italy in 1833; he spent the winter there, and returned the following autumn through France to Denmark. In 1836 his comedy of The Savings Bank enjoyed a great success. But it was not till 1837 that he developed his most important talent by writing the romantic drama of Sven I Dyrinfs House, a beautiful and original piece, which still holds the stage. His historical tragedy Valdemar Atterdag was not so well received in 1839; but in 1845 he achieved an immense success with his lyrical drama King Renë's Daughter, which has been translated into almost every European language, and successfully acted all over the civilized world. To this succeeded the tragedy of Ninon in 1818, the romantic comedy of Toηietta in 1849, A Sacrifice in 1853, The Youngest in 1854. His lyrical poems appeared in successive collections, dated 1832,1840, and 1814. From 1858 to 1859 he edited a very interesting literary journal entitled Weekly Leaves. He died in 1870. Hertz is one of the first of Danish lyrical poets. His poems are full of colour and passion, his versification has more witchcraft in it than any other poet’s of his age, and his style is grace itself. He has all the sensuous fire of Keats without his proclivity to the antique. As a romantic dramatist he is scarcely less original. He has bequeathed to the Danish theatre, in Svend Dyrinfs House and King Rene's Daughter, two pieces which have survived the vicissitudes of forty years, and which are as popular as ever. He is a troubadour by instinct; he has little or nothing of Scandinavian local colouring, and succeeds best when he is describing the scenery or the emotions of the glowing south.
