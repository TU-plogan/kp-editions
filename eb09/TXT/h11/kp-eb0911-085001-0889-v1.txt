HINGANGHÂT, a town in the Wardha district, Central Provinces, India, 21 miles S.W. of Wardha, in 20° 33' 30" N. lat., and 78° 52' 30" E. long., with a population in 1877 of 9415. It is a main seat of the cotton trade, the Hinganghât cotton produced in the rich Wardha valley being esteemed one of the best indigenous staples of India. The principal native traders are Mârwâris, many of whom have large transactions and export on their own account; but the [9:11:851] greater number merely act as middle-men between the cultivators and the large merchants. The municipal committee have opened a large gravelled market-place and storageyard, with raised platforms, and scales for weighing the cotton. The place consists of Old and New Hinganghât,— the former, a straggling town, liable to be flooded by the river Wanâ,; the latter, in which the better classes reside, laid out in broad streets and avenues.
