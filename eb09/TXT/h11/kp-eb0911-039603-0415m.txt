HALLER, Albrecht von (1708-1777), one of the greatest of the anatomists and physiologists of the 18th century, was born of an old Swiss family at Bern, October 16, 1708. Prevented by long-continued ill-health from taking part in boyish sports, he had the more opportunity for the development of his precocious mind. At the age of four, it is said, he used to read and expound the Bible to his father’s, servants; before he was ten he had sketched a Chaldee grammar, prepared a Greek and a Hebrew vocabulary, compiled a collection of two thousand biographies of famous men and women on the model of the great works of Bayle and Moreri, and written in Latin verse a satire on his tutor, who had warned him against a too great excursiveness. When still hardly fifteen he was already the author of numerous metrical translations from Ovid, Horace, and Virgil, as well as of original lyrics, dramas, and an epic of four thousand lines on the origin of the Swiss confederation, writings which he is said on one occasion to have rescued from a fire at the risk of his life, only, however, to burn them a little later (1729) with his own hand. Haller’s attention had been directed to the profession of medicine while he was residing in the house of a physician at Biel after his father’s death in 1721; and, following the choice then made, he while still a sickly and excessively shy youth went in his sixteenth year to the university of Tiibingen (December 1723), where he studied under Camerarius and Duvernoy. Dissatisfied with his progress, he in 1725 exchanged Tübingen for Leyden, where Boerhaave was in the zenith of his fame, and where Albinus had already begun to lecture in anatomy. At that university he graduated in May 1727, undertaking successfully in his thesis to prove that the so-called salivary duct, claimed as a recent discovery by [9:11:397] Coschwitz, was nothing more than a blood-vessel. Haller then visited London, making the acquaintance of Sir Hans Sloane, Cheselden, Pringle, Douglas, and other scientific men; next, after a short stay in Oxford, he visited Paris, where he studied under Ledran and Winslow ; and in 1728 lie proceeded to Basel, where he devoted himself to the study of the higher mathematics under John Bernoulli. It was during his stay there also that his first great interest in botany was awakened; and, in the course of a tour through Savoy, Baden, and several of the Swiss cantons, he began a collection of plants which was afterwards the basis of his great work on the flora of Switzerland. In 1729 he returned to Bern and began to practise as a physician; his best energies, however, were devoted to the botanical and anatomical researches which rapidly gave him a European •reputation, and procured for him from George II. in 1736 a call to the chair of medicine, anatomy, botany, and surgery, in the newly-founded university of Göttingen. The quantity of work achieved by Haller in the seventeen years during which he occupied this post was immense. Apart from the ordinary work of his classes, which entailed upon him the task of newly organizing a botanical garden, an anatomical theatre and museum, an obstetrical school, and similar institutions, he carried on without interruption those original investigations in botany and physiology, the results of which are preserved in the numerous works associated with his name; he continued also to persevere in his youthful habit of poetical composition, while at the same time he conducted a monthly scientific journal to which he is said to have contributed twelve thousand articles relating to almost every branch of human knowledge. He also warmly interested himself in most of the religious questions, both ephemeral and permanent, of his day; and the erection of the Reformed church in Göttingen was mainly due to his unwearied energy. Notwithstanding all this variety of absorbing interests he never felt at home in Göttingen; his untravelled heart kept ever turning towards his native Bern (where he had been elected a member of the great council in 1745), and in 1753 he resolved to resign his chair and return to Switzerland. The twenty-one years of his life which followed were largely occupied in the discharge of his duties as “amman,” to which honourable office he had been chosen by his fellow-citizens, and in the preparation of his Bibliotheca Medica, the botanical, surgical, and anatomical parts of which he lived to complete; but he also found time to write the three philosophical romances, —Usong (1771), Alfred (1773), and Fabius and Cato (1774),—in which his views as to the respective merits of despotism, of limited monarchy, and of aristocratic republican government are fully set forth. About 1773 the state of his health rendered necessary his entire withdrawal from public business; for some time he supported his failing strength by means of opium, on the use of which he communicated a paper to the Proceedings of the Göttingen Royal Society in 1776; the excessive use of the drug is believed, however, to havehastened his death, whichoccurred on the 17th of December 1777. Haller, who had been three times married, left eight children, the eldest of whom, Gottlieb Emanuel, attained to some distinction as a botanist and as a writer on Swiss history.

For some account of Haller’s contributions to the sciences of which he was especially an ornament, see the articles Anatomy (vol. i. p. 814) and Physiology. Subjoined is a classified but by no means an exhaustive list of his very numerous works in various branches of science and. literature :—(1) Anatomical :— leones αnα-tomfκ (1743-54); Disputationes anatomicae seleetiores (1746-52); and Opera, aead. minora anatomici argumenti (1762-68). (2)

Physiologic al: — De respiratione experimenta anatomica (1747); Primae lmeae physiologia (1747); and Elementa physiologia corporis humani (1757-6θ). (3) Pathological and surgical :— Opusculapatho logica (1755); Disputationum Chirurg, collectio (1777); also careful editions of Boerhaave’s Praelectiones academicoe in proprias insti tutiones rei medicae (1739), and of the Artis medicae principia of the same author (1769-74). (4) Botanical :— Enumeratio stirpium Hel veticarum (1742); Opuscula botanica (1749); Bibliotheca botanica (1771). (5) Theological :— Briefe über die wichtigsten Wahrheiten der Offenbarung (1772); and Briefe zur Vertheidigung der Offenbarung jmo-∏j (6) Poetical -.—Gedichte (1732, 12th ed. 1777). His three romances have been already mentioned. Several volumes of lectures and “Tagebücher” or journals were published posthumously.
