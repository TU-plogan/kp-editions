HARDT, Hermannvon der (1660-1746), Orientalist, descended from an old Dutch family, was born at Melle, in Westphalia, on 15th November 1660. His father, who was treasurer of the county of Tecklenburg, appreciating his son’s abilities, gave him a good education at Osnabrück, and sent him afterwards to Jena and Leipsic. Young Hardt, gifted with a quick disposition and a powerful memory, soon gained renown for his fluency in carrying on learned discussions in Latin; but the study of the Oriental languages diverted him from all other pursuits, and in no long time he made himself master of Hebrew, Syriac, and Chaldee. The duke of Brunswick, hearing of Hardt’s fame, appointed him his librarian shortly after the Orientalist had founded at Leipsic a philobiblical society, with the object of determining the sacred text. In 1690 Hardt was called to the chair of Oriental languages at Helmstadt; and his late master was prevailed upon to present to that university his valuable library, of which Hardt was again appointed to take charge in 1702. Seven years later he was named rector of the gymnasium of Marienburg, a post which he held till his death on 28th of February 1746.

Among his numerous writings, the following deserve mention:— Autographa Luthcri aliorumqzιe celebrium Virorum, ab anno 1517 ad annum 1546, Reformationis Aetatem et Historiam egregie illustrantia, 1690-91; Magnum Oecumenicum Constantiense Concilium, 1697; Hebroeoe linguae Fundamenta, 1694; Syriacoe linguae Fundamenta, 1694; Elementa Chaldaica, 1693; Historia litteraria Reformationis, 1717; Euigmata prisci orbis, 1723. The last is a collection of pieces previously published separately, all of which hal been condemned by the church. This republication was ordered to be suppressed. Hardt left a History of the Reformation in manuscript, which is preserved in the Helmstadt Juleum.
