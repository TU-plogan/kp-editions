HANAU, a town of Prussia, capital of a circle in the government district of Cassel, province of Hesse-Nassau, is situated at the confluence of the rivers Kinzig and Main, 12 miles E. of Frankfort. It consists of what are called an old and a new town. The streets of the former are narrow and irregular, but the latter, founded at' the end of the 16 th century by refugee Walloons and Netherlanders, is built in the form of a pentagon with broad streets crossing at right angles, and possesses several fine squares, among which may be mentioned the market-place, adorned with handsome fountains at the four corners. The town is the seat of a circle court, a head tax-office, a chamber of commerce, and a branch of the imperial bank. Among the principal buildings are the ancient castle, formerly· the residence of the counts of Hanau; the church of St John, dating from the 17th century, with a rather imposing tower; the old church of St Mary, formerly a collegiate church, and containing the tomb of the counts of Hanau; the church of the new town, built in the beginning of the 17th century, whose ground plan 13 in the form of two circles intersecting each other; the beautiful new Catholic church, the synagogue, the theatre, the barracks, the arsenal, the orphanage, and the infirmary. Its educational establishments include a gymnasium, a school of design, a real-school, and a higher girls’ school. There is a Wetteravian society of natural history and an historical society, both of which possess considerable libraries and collections connected with their respective branches of knowledge. Hanau is the birthplace of the brothers Grimm, and the house in which they were born is now adorned with a medallion. In the neighbourhood of the town are the electoral palace, with an extensive park and large orangeries, and the watering-place of Wilhelmsbad. Hanau is the principal commercial and manufacturing town in the province, and stands next to Cassel in point of population. Its staples are ornaments of various kinds, cigars, leather, paper, playing cards, silver and platina wares, chocolate, soap, woollen cloth, hats, silk, gloves, stockings, ropes, and matches. It has also three large foundries and a number of breweries, and in the neighbourhood there are extensive powder-mills. It carries on a large trade in wood, wine, and corn, in addition to its articles of manufacture. The population of the town in 1875 was 22,269.

From the number of urns, coins, and other antiquities found near Hanau it would appear that it owes its origin to a Roman settlement. It was raised to the rank of a town in 1393, and in 1528 it was fortified by Count Philip, who rebuilt the castle. At the end of the 16th century its prosperity received considerable impulse from the accession of the Walloons and Netherlanders. During the Thirty Years’ War it was in 1631 taken by the Swedes, and in 1636 it was besieged by the imperial troops, but was relieved on the 13th June by Landgrave William V. of Cassel, on account of which the day is still commemorated by the inhabitants. Napoleon on his retreat from Leipsic defeated the Germans under Marshal Wrede at Hanau, October 30, 1813; and on the following day the allies vacated the town, when it was entered by the French. In 1429 Hanau became the capital of a province of the empire, which on the death of Count Reinhard II. was in 1451 partitioned between the Hanau-Münzenberg and Hanau-Lichtenberg lines, but was reunited in 1692 when the elder line became extinct. The younger line received princely rank in 1696, but, as it also became extinct, Hanau-Münzenberg in 1736 was joined to Hesse-Cassel and Hanau-Lichtenberg to Hesse-Darmstadt. In 1785 the whole province was united to Hesse-Cassel, and in 1803 it became an independent principality. In 1813 it again came into the possession of Htsse-Cassel, and in 1866 it was joined to Prussia.
