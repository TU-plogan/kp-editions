HILVERSUM, a village and commune in the Netherlands in the province of North Holland, about equally distant from Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Amersfoort, with all of which it is connected by railway. The village is well sheltered on the west and north-west by a range of hills, and since 1874 it has been the seat of a hospital, the Trompenberg, for convalescents. The public buildings comprise a town-house and four churches and a synagogue, and there is a very handsome railway station. The weaving of floor-cloths, horse blankets, and Hilversum stripe is the principal industry. In 1423 Hilversum was separated from Laren. In 1505 it suffered at the hands of the people of Guelderland, in 1629 from the Croats, and in 1672 from the French. The population of the village in 1840 was 5160, and in 1870 5611; while that of the commune in the same years was 5314 and 6615. Of this last number 3463 were Roman Catholics, 2327 belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church, and 236 were Jews.
