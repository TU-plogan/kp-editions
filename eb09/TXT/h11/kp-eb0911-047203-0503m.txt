HARDENBERG, KarlAugust (1750-1822), Prussian statesman,was bornât Esselroda in Hanover, May 31,1750. Having studied at Leipsic and Göttingen, he entered the Hanoverian civil service as chamber councillor (Kammerrath) in 1770, and afterwards spent some time in Wetzlar, Ratisbon, Vienna, and Berlin, and travelled in France, Holland, and England. He was made privy chamber councillor (Geheim-Kammerrath) and raised to the rank of count in 1778; but a private quarrel with the prince of Wales compelled him four years afterwards to give up his appointments in Hanover and seek a new career. In 1787 he received the office of president of the board of domains (Kammercollegium) in Brunswick; and he was entrusted with the duty of delivering to Frederick William II. of Prussia the will of Frederick the Great, who had deposited it with the duke of Brunswick. Frederick William II. was so impressed by Hardenberg’s appearance and character that in 1790 he recommended him as a minister to the margrave of Anspach and Baireuth. These principalities being united to Prussia in 1791, Hardenberg was appointed a Prussian cabinet minister, but continued to perform his duties as chief administrator of the new province. In the war with the French republic he acted as minister of war, and in- 1795 signed on behalf of Prussia the treaty of peace concluded at Basel. When Frederick William III. mounted the throne in 1797, Hardenberg was transferred from Anspach-Baireuth to Berlin, where he received high offices in the cabinet, being also soon afterwards nominated chief of the departments for Magdeburg and Halberstadt, for Westphalia, and for Neuchâtel. At this time the foreign policy of Prussia was determined by Haugwitz, who was on all occasions subservient to Napoleon. When in 1803 Prussian interests seemed to be threatened by the French occupation of Hanover, Haugwitz fell into disrepute, and in the following year his place at the head of the cabinet was [9:11:473] taken by Hardenberg. The latter was anxious to maintain peace, but when in 1805 Napoleon’s troops marched through Anspach he strongly protested, and entered into a convention with Russia. The victory of the French at Austerlitz, however, made it difficult for Prussia to proceed to hostilities; and on the 15th December 1805 Haugwitz signed a convention with Napoleon, whereby in return for Hanover Prussia conceded Anspach, Cleves, and Neuchâtel to the French. Hardenberg then retired, and Haugwitz returned to power. The policy of Haugwitz was exceedingly unpopular, and led to the war in which his country was prostrated at the feet of Napoleon. After the battle of Jena Hardenberg undertook the office of foreign minister; but when the treaty of Tilsit was signed he withdrew and watched from a distance the vigorous and enlightened efforts of Stein to restore new life to the fallen and humiliated state. Stein being compelled to retire in 1810, Hardenberg was recognized as the only possible successor of the great minister; and he amply justified the confidence with which he was honoured. The circumstances of the time did not admit of his pursuing an independent foreign policy; but he steadily prepared for the inevitable struggle with France by carrying out Stein’s far-reaching schemes of social and political reorganization. The military system was completely reformed, serfdom was abolished, municipal institutions were fostered, the civil service was thrown open to all classes, and great attention was devoted to the educational needs of every section of the community. In the war of liberation Hardenberg was one of those who did most to stimulate the patriotic enthusiasm not only of the Prussians but of all Germans; and so important were his services that on the 3d June 1814, after he had signed the first treaty of Paris, he was raised to the rank of a Fürst or Prince. He accompanied the allied sovereigns to London, was one of the chief plenipotentiaries at the congress of Vienna, and took a leading part in the negotiations which led to the second treaty of Paris. After the restoration of peace he retained his place at the head of the Prussian cabinet, but his conduct of affairs was no longer marked by energy and foresight. He was accused of being too submissive to the papacy, and, although a man of liberal sentiments, he had not the courage to resist his royal master’s dislike of constitutional government. He died at Genoa, November 26, 1822.

Hardenberg wrote memoirs of the time between 1801 and the conclusion of the treaty of Tilsit, and entrusted them before his death to his friend Scholl, a councillor of state. They were sealed by Frederick William III. and placed in the state archives, with directions that they should not be published until after the lapse of fifty years. At the end of this time they were entrusted by Prince Bismarck to Leopold von Ranke, who issued them accompanied by a biography of the author (Denkwürdigkeiten des Staatskanzlers Fürsten von Hardenberg, 4 vols., 1877).
