HEIDELOFF, Karl Alexander von (1788-18G5), a German architect, was the son of Victor Peter Heideloff, a painter of some reputation, and was born at Stuttgart 2d February 1788. He studied at the art academy of his native town, and after following the profession of an architect for some time at Coburg was in 1818 appointed city architect at Nuremberg. In 1822 he became professor at the polytechnic school, and some years later he was chosen conservator of the monuments of art. Heideloff devoted his chief attention to the Gothic style of architecture, and the buildings restored and erected by him at Nuremberg and in its neighbourhood attest both his original skill and his purity of taste. He also achieved some success as an historical painter. He died at Hassfurt 28th September 1865.

Among his writings on architecture are Die Lehre von den Säulenordnungen, 1827; Der Kleine Vignola, 1832; Nürnbergs Baudenkmäler der Vorzeit, 1838-43; and Die Ornamentik des Mittelalters, 1838-42.
