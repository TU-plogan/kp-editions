HERODIANUS, Aelius, a famous grammarian of antiquity, called by Priscian “maximus auctor artis gram-maticje.” He was the son of the grammarian Apollonius, was born at Alexandria, and resided at Rome. He was patronized by the emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180 a.d.), to whom he dedicated his great treatise on prosody. This was a work in twenty books, called Καθολική Προσωδία, which included also an account of the etymological part of grammar. An epitome of it has been preserved. Abstracts of a treatise on difficult words and peculiar forms, called 'Eπιμepισμοι, are also extant. Besides these, Herodianus wrote various other treatises; but of the large number of titles quoted, some are probably merely names for parts of larger works. Only one of them has come down complete—a treatise on monosyllables (ττ∈pι μονήρους λε'⅛εως). Numerous quotations, however, and considerable fragments still exist.

Fabricius (Bibl. Groec. vi. 278 sqq.) enumerates his works and the passages where they are quoted. Lenz {Hcrοdiani technici reliquiae, Lips. 1867-70) has collected and thoroughly edited all the remains.
