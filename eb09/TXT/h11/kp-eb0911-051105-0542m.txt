HASTINGS, a municipal and parliamentary borough and market-town of Sussex, England, the principal of the Cinque Ports, is picturesquely situated on the southern coast of England, 74 miles from London by the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, and 62 by the London and South-Eastern Railway. It lies in two gorges, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills and cliffs on every side except the south. At the beginning of the century, when [9:11:512] it first came into reputation as a watering-place, Hastings consisted of two main streets; but since then many new streets and squares have been added, and St Leonards, at that time about a mile distant, is now connected with it by a line of terraces and parades, and forms its more fashionable district. On the brink of the western cliff there still stand a square and a circular tower of the old castle, probably erected so m after the time of William the Conqueror, and the ruins, opened up by excavation in 1824, of the castle chapel, a transitional Norman structure 110 feet long, with a nave, chancel, and aisles. Besides the chapel, there was also at one time a college, both being under the control of a dean and secular canons. The deanery was at one time held by Thomas a Becket, and one of the canonries by William of Wykeham. The principal public buildings are the old parish churches of All Saints and St Clements, both in the Perpendicular style, the former containing in its register for 1619 the baptism of Titus Oates, whose father was rector of the parish, and the latter two brasses to Thomas Weekes (d. 1563) and John Bailey (d. 1592); the town-hall, erected in 1823; the music hall, erected in 1859; the assembly-room, the Roman Catholic college, the Augustinian monastery, and the Albert memorial and drinking fountain, erected in 1864. Among the industries of the town are fishing, boat-building, and coach-making; but its prosperity depends chiefly upon its reputation as a watering-place. Its popularity in this respect is owing to its historical interest, its picturesque situation, the many beautiful walks in the neighbourhood, its fine level sands, and its healthy climate, which, while bracing and vigorous in the higher parts of the town, is in its lower parts specially suited, from its mildness, for sufferers from pulmonary complaints. The town is well supplied with hotels, reading rooms, and pleasure gardens, and possesses a line of parades extending along the coast for nearly 3 miles. The Marina, a covered parade 600 feet in length, was built in 1825. There is a fine pier, opened in 1872, 900 feet in length, and possessing a pavilion capable of seating nearly 2000 persons. A public park, 70 acres in extent, is at present being laid out. The sewage of the town is conveyed a considerable distance out to sea before it is discharged. The area of the municipal borough is 1636 acres, and of the parliamentary borough 4617 acres. The population of the municipal borough in 1871 was 29,291, and of the parliamentary borough 33,337.

Hastings is of great antiquity, and was a place of some importance in the time of the Anglo-Saxons. Some derive its name from Hasten, a Danish pirate who ravaged that coast in the time of Alfred the Great. According to the French biographer of Edward the Confessor, it was so called from the hasty manner in which William renewed its fortifications. It is mentioned in the chronicles as Haeslingas, and is reckoned as distinct from the shire of Sussex. In the Bayeux tapestry it is called Heslinga-ceaslra. A mint was established at it by Athelstan in 924, of which there is some notice in the Domesday Book. In 1049, according to the Worcester Chronicle, its seamen distinguished themselves in the pursuit of the pirate Swend after the murder of Beorn, and took two of his ships. Like the other principal seaports on the southern coast, it was garrisoned by Harold in view of the possible landing of William the Conqueror,to whom, however, it suιτendered without striking a blow, and who selected it as the site of a permanent camp, and erected a wooden fortress on the cliff on which the castle was afterwards built. From this camp William, on the morning of October 14th, 1066, set out to meet Harold at Senlac Hill; and after his great victory there he returned to it, and remained encamped five days in the hope of receiving the homage of the English. The site of the original town is supposed to be now in great part covered by the sea. By a charter of William the Conqueror Hastings, together with Hythe,was added to the three previously incorporated ports of Sandwich, Dover, and Romney, and invested with certain privileges, the five being subsequently known as the “Cinque Ports.” In the reign of Edward I. it was rated at 21 ships with 21 seamen in each, for the service of the king for fourteen days at his own charge. In 1377 the town was burned down by th e French, but it was soon afterwards rebuilt. The harbour has fallen almost into disuse since the time of Elizabeth, when the αvooden pier was destroyed by a storm; it does not now admit vessels above 100 tons burthen, and this only at full tide. The town received a charter of incorporation from Elizabeth in 1558, which was confirmed and enlarged by Charles II. In the 42d of Edward III. it obtained the privilege of returning two members to parliament.
