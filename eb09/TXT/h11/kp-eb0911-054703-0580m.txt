HAZÂRIBÂGH, a British district in the lieutenantgovernorship of Bengal, India, lying between 23° 25' and 24° 48' N. lat., and between 84° 29' and 86° 38' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Gayâ and Monghyr, on the E. by the Santâl Parganâs and Mânbhüm districts, on the S. by Lohârdagâ, and on the W. by Lohârdagâ and Gayâ; it forms the north-east portion of the Chutiâ Nâgpur division, and has an area of 7020 square miles.

The physical formation of Hazâribâgh exhibits three distinct features—(I) a high central plateau occupying the western section, the surface of which is undulating and cultivated; (2) a lower and more extensive plateau stretching along the north and eastern portions; to the north, the land is well cultivated,, while to the east the country is of a more varied character, the elevation is lower, and the character of a plateau is gradually lost; (3) the central valley of the Dâmodar river occupying the entire southern section. Indeed, although the characteristics of the district are rock, hill, and wide-spreading jungle, fine patches of cultivation are met with in all parts, and the scenery is generally pleasing and often picturesque. The district forms a part of the chain of high land which extends across the continent of India, south of the Nerbudda on the west, and south of the S<5n river on the east. The most important river of Hazâribâgh is the Dâmodar, with its many tributaries, which drains an area of 2480 square miles. The only other river of any importance is the Barakhar. The jungle gives shelter to wild animals of all sorts. Game birds are plentiful.

The census of 1872 showed a population of 771,875 (males, 397,045; females, 374,830). Belonging to aboriginal tribes there are 57,120; serni-Hinduized aborigines, 216,712; Hindus, 421,622; persons of Hindu origin not recognizing caste, 2664; Mahometans, 72,338; non-Asiatics, 1362; and mixed races, 57. Three municipalities contain more than 5000 inhabitants :—Hazaribagh, 11,050; Ichak, 8999; and Chatrâ, 8818. The only place of special interest is Pàrasnâth Hill, a celebrated place of pilgrimage, which is annually visited by large numbers of Jain worshippers. The revenue in 1870 amounted to £32,841, and the expenditure to £31,367. The regular police force (1872) numbered 557 men of all ranks; municipal force, 65; and rural police, 3834 men; maintained at a total cost of £15,763. There were, in 1873, 86 schools with 2183 pupils. Rice is the staple crop, and the three principal kinds are grown. Among the other crops are wheat, barley, Indian corn, the usual pulses and green crops of Bengal, jnte, flax, aloes, sugarcane, opium, cotton, &c. The trade is concentrated at Chatrâ, the great central market. The chief exports are lac, metal cooking utensils, ghi, iron, and cattle; and the imports, rice, salt, cattle, and tobacco. There are 400 miles of road. Six coal-fields are known to exist in the district,—the most important being that of Karharbari, which is capable of supplying 250,000 tons a year for 300 years. In 1877 there were three tea plantations containing mature plants, and one on Pârasnâth Hill which promises well. The average mean temperature for 1874 was 74° F.; the average [9:11:548] yearly rainfall, 52'4 inches. The climate is very healthy, but rheumatism, fever, and dysentery are not uncommon; cholera is rare.

The history of the district is involved in obscurity until 1755, about which time a certain Mukund Sinh was chief of the country. In a few years he was superseded by a Tej Sinh, who had gained the assistance of the British. In 1780 Hazâribâgh, along with the surrounding territory, passed under direct British rule.

Hazâribâgh, the chief town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is picturesquely situated on the high central plateau of the district, at an elevation of 2000 feet above sea-level, and in the midst of a group of conical hills, 23° 59' 21" N. lat and 85° 24' 32" E. long. The town is little more than a cluster of villages, with intervening cultivation, which have sprung up round the military bàzar. Hazâribâgh has been the military headquarters of the district since 1780, and the seat of civil administration since 1834. The cantonment lies southeast of the town. Population in 1872, 11,050 (6312 males, 4738 females):—Hindus, 7240; Mahometans, 3384; Christians, 52; “others,” 374.
