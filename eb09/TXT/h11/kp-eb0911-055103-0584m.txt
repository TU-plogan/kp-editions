HEAD, Sir George (1782—1855), brother of the preceding, was born in 1782. He was educated at the Charterhouse. In 1808 he received an appointment in the commissariat of the British army in the Peninsula, where be was a witness of many exciting scenes and important battles, of which he gave an interesting account in “Memoirs of an Assistant Commissary-General” attached to the second volume of his Home Tour, published in 1837. In 1814 he was sent to America to take charge of the commissariat in a naval establishment on the Canadian lakes, and he subsequently held appointments at Halifax andNova Scotia. Some of his Canadian experiences were narrated by him in Forest Scenery and Incidents in the Wilds of North America, published in 1829. In 1831 he received the honour of knighthood. He published in 1835 A Home Tour through the Manufacturing Districts of England, and in 1837 a sequel to it, entitled A Home Tour through various parts of the United Kingdom. Both works are amusing and instructive, but his Rome, a Tour of Many Days, published in 1849, is somewhat dull and tedious. He also contributed several articles to the Quarterly Review, and translated Historical Memoirs of Cardinal Pacca, 1850, and the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, 1851. He died in London, May 2, 1855.
