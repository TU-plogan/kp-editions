HAVERCAMP, Sigebert (1683-1742), classical editor and numismatist, was born at Utrecht in December 1683. After studying at the university of his native town and at Leyden, he entered the church, and became minister of Stad-aan-’t Haringvliet, in the island of Overflakkee. There he remained till 1721, when he succeeded Gronovius in the Greek chair at Leyden, becoming shortly afterwards professor of history and rhetoric also. He died at Leyden, April 23, 1742.

His editions of Latin and Greek authors are useful and learned compilations, rather than original critical commentaries, and bear frequent traces of the rapidity with which they were produced. They are the following:— Tertulliαη, 1718; Lucretius, 1725; Josephus, 1726; Eutropiτιs, 1729; Orosius, 1738; Sallust, 1742; and Censorinus, 1743. See Dibdin’s Classics under these names. His principal numismatic works are Dissertationes de Alexandri Magni Numismate, 1722; Thesaurus Morellianus, 1734; Universal History, illustrated from Medals (in Dutch), 1736; Nurnrnophy∙ lacium regime Christinas, 1742. He was also the author of Sylloge Scriptorum qui de linguoe Groecae vera et recta Pronuntiatione commentarios reliquerunt, 1740; Introductio in Historiam Γatrice, 1739; and Introductio in Antiquitates Romanas, 1740.
