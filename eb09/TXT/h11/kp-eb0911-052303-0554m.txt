HAUSER, Kaspar, a German youth whose life was remarkable from the circumstances of apparently inexplicable mystery in which it was involved. He appeared on May 20, 1828, in the streets of Nuremberg, dressed in the garb of a peasant, and with such a helpless and bewildered air that lie attracted the attention of the passers-by. In his possession was found a letter purporting to be written by a poor labourer, stating that the boy was given into his custody on the 7th October 1812, and that according to agreement he had instructed him in reading, writing, and the Christian religion, but that up to the time fixed for relinquishing his custody he had kept him in close confinement. Along with this letter was enclosed another purporting to be written by the boy’s mother, stating that he was born on the 30th April 1812, that his name was Kaspar, and that his father, formerly a cavalry officer in the 6th regiment at Nuremberg, wa3 dead. The appearance, bearing, and professions of the youth corresponded closely with these credentials. He showed a repugnance to all nourishment except bread and water, was seemingly ignorant of outward objects, wrote his name as Kaspar Hauser, and said that he wished to be a cavalry officer like his father. For some time he was detained in prison at Nuremberg as a vagrant, but on July 18, 1828, he was delivered over to the care of Professor Daumer, who undertook to be his guardian and to take the charge of his education. On October 17, 1829, he was found to have received a wound in the forehead, which according to his own statement had been inflicted on him by a man with a blackened face. Having on this account been removed to the house of a magistrate and placed under close surveillance, he was visited by Earl Stanhope, who became so interested in his history that he sent him to Ansbach to be educated. After this he became clerk in the office of Feuerbach, president of the court of appeal, and his strange history was almost forgotten by the public when the interest in it was suddenly revived by his death on the 14th December 1833 from a deep wound on his left breast. He affirmed that the wound was inflicted by a stranger, but many believed it to be the work of his own hand, and that he did not intend it to be fatal, but only so severe as to give a sufficient colouring of truth to his story.

In 1830 a pamphlet was published at Berlin, entitled Kaspar Hauser nicht unwahrscheinlich ein Betrüger·, but the truthfulness of his statements was defended by Daumer, who published Mitthcilungen uber Kaspar Hauser (Nuremberg, 1832), and Enthüllungen uber Kaspar Hauser (Frankfort, 1859); as well as Kaspar Hauser, sein Wesen, seine Unschuld, &c. (Regensburg, 1873), in answer to Meyers Authentische Mittheilungen über Kaspar 7Za«sc7»(Ansbach, 1872). Feuerbach awakened considerable psychological interest in the case by his pamphlet Kaspar Hauser, Beispiel eines Verbrechens am Seelenleben (Ansbach, 1832), and Earl Stanhope also took part in the discussion by publishing Materialien zur Geschichte K. Hausers (Heidelberg, 1836). The theory of Daumer and Feuerbach was that the youth was the son of the grand-duke Charles of Baden, and that he had been kidnapped by the countess of Hochberg in order to secure the succession to the children of the grandduke Charles Frederick; but this theory was set aside in 1875 by the publication in the Augsburg Allgemeine Zeitung of the official record of the baptism, post-mortem examination, and burial of the heir supposed to have been kidnapped. See Kaspar Hauser und sein badisches Brinzcnthum (Heidelberg, 1876).
