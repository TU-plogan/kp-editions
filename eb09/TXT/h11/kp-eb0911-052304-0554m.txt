HAÜY, RenéJust (1743-1822), an eminent French mineralogist, commonly styled the Abbé Haiiy, from being an honorary canon of Notre Dame, was born at St Just, in the department of Oise, February 28, 1743. His parents were in a humble rank of life, and were only enabled by the kindness of friends to educate their son. He was sent to Paris to the college of Navarre, and afterwards to that of Lemoine, where he finished his course amid incredible privations and difficulties. He escaped from these when, in 1764, he was himself appointed one of the teachers in the first of the above-named colleges. He began to devote his leisure hours to the study of botany; but an accident directed his attention to another field in natural history. Happening to let fall a beautiful specimen of calcareous spar belonging to a friend, he discovered, by examining the fragments, the geometrical law of crystallization. By experimenting on a hexahedral crystal of this substance, he found that it could be so dissected, by dividing it by planes parallel to certain edges, as to exhibit a rhombohedral nucleus, and, by extending his experiments, lie farther showed that the same result could be obtained from mechanical division of every crystal of the same species. This led him to the theory that crystals are composed of what he called “integrant molecules,” which he held had each the same shape as the respective nuclei got at by mechanical division. To obtain the different crystalline forms these molecules were supposed to be built up in layers round the nucleus, each layer diminishing regularly in the number of rows of molecules, and the rows at the same time diminishing in the number of molecules according to the nature of the crystal. A full account of his mathematical theory of this subject is given by Haüy in his Traité de Mineralogie (see Crystallography). Daubenton and Laplace immediately recognized the scientific value of the discovery, which, when communicated to the Academy, secured for its author a place in that society. Besides the important service which he rendered to crystallography, Haüy also greatly increased our knowledge of pyro-electricity. He demonstrated by experiment in the case of tourmaline that the positive and negative charges of electricity at the respective ends of the crystal diminish rapidly as we approach the middle point, where they disappear. He showed also that each particle of a broken pyro-electric crystal itself exhibits polarity; and he was likewise the first to observe that, in all minerals, the pyro-electric state has an important connexion with the want of symmetry of the crystals. In tourmaline, for instance, he found the vitreous charge always at the summit with six, and the resinous at the summit with three faces (see Electricity). When the Revolution broke out, Haüy was thrown into prison, and his life was even in danger, when he was saved by the intercession of Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire. Under Napoleon he became professor of mineralogy at the museum of natural history. He also obtained other scientific preferment, of which he was deprived by the feeble Government of the Restoration, though his royalism had been a serious bar to his promotion under the empire. His latter days were consequently clouded by the poverty wdιich had threatened to blight his early career. But the courage and high moral qualities which had helped him forward in his youth did [9:11:524] nut desert him in his old age; and he lived cheerful and respected till his death, June 3, 1822.

The following are his principal works :— Essai d'une Théorie sur la Structure des Cristaux, 1784; Exposition raisonnée de la Théorie de VÉlectricité et du Magnétisme, d'après les Principes d’Aepinus, 1787; De la Structure considérée comme Caractère Distinctif des Minéraux, 1793; Exposition abrégée de la Théorie de la Structure des Cristaux, 1793; Extrait d'un Traité Élémentaire de Minéralogie, 1797; Traité de Minéralogie, 1802, 4 vols., 2d ed.; Traité Élémentaire de Physique, 1803, 1806, 2 vols.; Tableau Comparatif des Résultats de la Cristallographie, et de VAnalyse Chimique relativement à la Classification des Minéraux; Traité des Pierres Précieuses, 1817; Traité de Cristallographie, 1822, 2 vols. He also contributed papers to various scientific journals, particularly the Journal d’Histoire Naturelle, Annales de Chimie, Journal de Physique, Magasin Encyclopédique, Annales du Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, and Journal des Mines.
