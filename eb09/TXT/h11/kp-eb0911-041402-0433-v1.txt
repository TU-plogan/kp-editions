HAMILTON, Elizabeth (1758-1816), novelist and miscellaneous writer, was born at Belfast, of Scotch extraction, 25th July 1758. Her father’s death in 1759 left his wife so embarrassed that Elizabeth was adopted in 1762 by her paternal aunt, Mrs Marshall, who lived in Scotland, near Stirling. There Elizabeth spent her youth and received a good education,—at first at school, afterwards in private, and latterly for some months under masters at Edinburgh and Glasgow. In her 15th year she made a tour in the Highlands with some friends, and wrote a journal of it for her aunt’s perusal, which was inserted, unknown to the authoress, in a provincial magazine. In 1780 Mrs Marshall died, and Miss Hamilton was prevented by household cares from using her pen; but in 1785 she made her first voluntary contribution to the press in the shape of a letter to the Lounger, of which paper it forms the 46th number. On the death of Mr Marshall in 1788, Miss Hamilton lived for a time with her brother, Captain Charles Hamilton, who was engaged on his translation of the Hedaya. Prompted by her brother’s associations, she produced her Letters of a Hindoo Liajah in 1796, and soon after, with her sister Mrs Blake, settled at Bath, where she published in 1800 the Memoirs of Modern Philosophers, a kind of satire on the admirers of the French Revolution. In 1801-2 the Letters on Education appeared, her most valuable though not her most popular work. After travelling though Wales and Scotland [9:11:415] for nearly two years, the sisters took up their abode in 1803 at Edinburgh. In 1804 Mrs Hamilton, as she then preferred to be called, published her Life of Agrippina, wife of Germanicus ; and in the same year she received a pension from Government. About this time she consented to take charge for six months of a widowed Scotch nobleman’s family; and to his eldest daughter were addressed Letters on the Moral and Religious Principle, published in 1800. Her next publication of importance, The Cottagers of Glenburnie, appeared in 1808. This work, to which the authoress owes most of her fame, is an admirable description of the failings of the Scotch peasantry in their home life, and, while graphic and telling, is “saved from caricature and absurdity.” Sir Walter Scott describes it as “a picture of the rural habits of Scotland, of striking and impressive fidelity ;” and Lord Jeffrey reviewed it very favourably in the Edinburgh Review (vol. xii.). Her subsequent works were a supplement to her Letters on Education, under the name of Popular Essays on the Elementary Principles of the Human Mind (1812), and Hints addressed to the Patrons and Directors of Public Schools (1815). She died at Harrogate, July 23, 1816.

Memoirs of Mrs Elizabeth Hamilton, by Miss Benger, were published in 1818. A notice of her literary life and labours, attributed to Miss Edgeworth, appeared in the Monthly Magazine for September 1816.
