HATVAN, a market-town in the county of Heves, Hungary, is situated on the left bank of the Zagyva, at the junction of the Pest-Miskolcz, Hatvan-Rutka, and Hatvan-Szolnok lines of rail way,about 30 miles E.N.E. of Budapest, 47’ 40' N. lat., 19° 4Γ E. long. Hatvan possesses a handsome church and an elegant castle. There are two large cloth factories, and a court of assize is held there. Many of the inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood are employed in raising fruit and melons, in improving the breed of sheep and in tending large herds of horses, which graze wild on the spacious communal pasture-lands. Cattle fairs are frequently held in the town, and the trade in horses is considerable. In 1870 the population amounted to 4018, for the most part Magyars by nationality and Roman Catholics by creed.

As a fortified place Hatvan rose to some importance in the Middle Ages. In July 1525 a diet of Magyar nobles was held there. Subsequent to the catastrophe at Mohacs (1526), Hatvan, along with many other Hungarian towns, fell into the hands of the Turks. After being besieged by the imperialists in 1594 and 1595, it was taken by them on the 3d September 1596. In 1678 it was almost completely destroyed by the Ottoman forces. On the 2d April 1849 the Austrians were defeated by the Hungarians in a sanguinary engagement near the town.
