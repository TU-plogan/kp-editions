HILL, Viscount (1772-1842). Rowland Hill, nephew of the Rev. Rowland Hill, was born at Frees, Shropshire, 11th August 1772. After receiving his early education at Ightfield and Chester, he was gazetted to the 38th regiment, obtaining permission at the same time to improve himself in the knowledge of his profession in a military academy at Strasburg, where he continued after removing into the 53d regiment with the rank of lieutenant. In the beginning of 1793 he raised an independent company, and was promoted to the rank of captain. The same year he distinguished himself at the siege of Toulon; and after serving for some time on the Continent he in 1797 set out as colonel of the 90th regiment with Sir Ralph Abercromby’s expedition to Egypt, where he acquired great distinction, and was wounded at the battle of Alexandria. Having in 1803 been gazetted brigadier-general, he in 1808 accompanied Sir Arthur Wellesley to Spain, and from Vimiera to Vittoria, in advance or retreat, he proved himself the most indefatigable coadjutor of the great captain. In 1809 he was gazetted lieutenant-general, and in the following year was appointed to the independent command of the second army corps of Wellington in Portugal; in 1811 he annihilated the French army under Girard at Arroyomolinos (Caceres), in recognition of which he received the order of the Bath; and for his capture of the forts of Almarez, which cut off the communication between the French armies on the north and south sides of the Tagus, he was in 1814 rewarded with the title of Baron Hill of Almarez. In 1813 he held temporarily the command of the English and Hanoverian troops in Belgium, and two years later crowned the glories of his noble career by his conduct at Waterloo, where he was at the head of the brigade which resisted and repulsed the last effort made in behalf of the French by the imperial guard. When Wellington became premier in 1828 Hill received the appointment of general commanding-in-chief, and on resigning this office in 1842 he was created a viscount. He died on the 10th December of the same year. Lord Hill was, next to Wellington, the most popular and able soldier of his time in the British service, and was so much beloved by the troops, especially those under his immediate command, that he gained from them the honourable title of “the soldier’s friend.” “With Hill,” they used to say, “both victory and life may be ours.” On the other hand, the strategic skill and military capacity he displayed in the Peninsula secured for him the not less honourable title of “the right arm of the duke of Wellington.” From the first day he entered the army he displayed the germs of those qualities that afterwards secured for him fame, rank, and power—boldness that amounted to daring and was yet always under the control of calm judgment, skill equal to independent commands of the most difficult kind, and a regard for the moral and physical welfare of the army such as had never before been shown by any commander-in-chief.

The Life of Lord Hill, G.C.B., by Rev. Edwin Sidney, A.Μ., appeared in 1845.
