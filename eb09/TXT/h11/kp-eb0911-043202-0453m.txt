HAMPTON, a village in the county of Middlesex, England, is situated on the north bank of the Thames, 12 miles W.S.W. from Hyde Park Corner. The parish church erected in 1830, with a square tower at its western end, is without architectural merit, but the churchyard contains a number of interesting old monuments. Among the many fine residences in the vicinity is Garrick Villa, formerly, under the name of Hampton House, the residence of Garrick the famous actor. In the neighbourhood there are a number of large pumping works for supplying London with water. The free grammar school founded in 1556 was reopened in 1878 as a middle-class school, for which the usual fees are charged. The population of the village in 1871 was 2207.

About a mile from Hampton village and close to the river stands Hampton Court Palace, one of the finest extant specimens of the Tudor style of architecture, and formerly a royal residence. It was originally erected by Cardinal Wolsey, who in 1515 received a lease of the old mansion and grounds for 99 years. As the splendour of the building seemed to awaken the cupidity of Henry VIII., Wolsey in 1526 thought it prudent to make him a present of it. It became Henry’s favourite residence, and he made several additions to the building, including the great hall and chapel in the Gothic style. Of the original five quadrangles only two now remain, but a third was erected by Sir Christopher Wren for William III. The fine gardens, extending to 44 acres, were laid out at the desire of William III. in the Dutch style, with elevated terraces, long shady walks, and a labyrinth called the “Maze,” which is the source of great amusement to visitors. Bushy Park, opposite the palace gardens, is open to the public, and contains a celebrated avenue of chestnut trees. The palace was sold by the parliament in 1641, but afterwards came into the hands of Cromwell; and it continued to be one of the principal residences of the English sovereigns until the time of George II. It was the birthplace of Edward VI., and the meeting-place of the conference held in the reign of James I. to settle the dispute between the Presbyterians and the state clergy. It is now partly occupied by persons of rank in reduced circumstances; but its state apartments, picture gallery, and gardens are open to the public free of charge. The celebrated cartoons of Raphael which it formerly possessed have lately been removed to the South Kensington [9:11:433] Museum, but it still contains a valuable collection of pictures, including a number of fine specimens of the old masters, and a large collection of portraits of persons famous in English history.
