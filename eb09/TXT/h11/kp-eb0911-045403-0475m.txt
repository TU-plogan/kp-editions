HARA Γv, Herer, Hurrur, Harrar-Gay, or Ararge, a city of north-eastern Africa, in the country of the Gallas, at one time the capital of the province of Hadiyah in the Zayla empire, for a long period a small independent state under an emir of its own, and since 1876 subject to the Egyptian crown. The Somali call it Adari and the Gallas Adaray. According to Burton it stands in 9° 20' N. lat. and 42° 17' E. long, but the Bulletin de Vetat major general de V armée égyptienne makes the latitude 9° 26' and the longitude 42° 6'. The height above the sea is according to Burton 5500 feet, and according to the Bulletin 5580. A stone wall, pierced by five gates and flanked by 24 towers, encloses the city, which occupies an area of 128 acres on the irregular slope of a hill, and comprises 9560 houses and 346 huts, arranged in narrow streets that run up and down hill. There are five mosques within the walls, but only one, the jami (or cathedral, so to speak), is a building of considerable dimensions. The palace of the emir is a mere shed, long, single-storied, and windowless. Among the chapels to Mahometan saints it is enough to mention that of Sheikh Umar Abadir El Bakai, the patron of the city. Harar has long been the seat of a considerable commerce, though before the Egyptian conquests the merchants had to submit to the exorbitant exactions of their Galla neighbours, who had command of all the caravan routes. Slaves, ivory, coffee, tobacco, safflower, cotton cloths, mules, holcus, wheat, glue, honey, and gums are mentioned by Burton among their principal articles of trade, in return for which they brought back a great variety of wares for local consumption. The Harar coffee especially has a high repute, and the tobacco also is good. The kât or gât (Catha edulis of Forskal), the leaves of which are a favourite stimulant or narcotic in north-eastern Africa, grows abundantly in the neighbourhood; and the inhabitants often sit together reading the Koran and enjoying the drug for ten or eleven hours at a time. The rainy season at Harar begins about the 15th of March, and lasts for six months, the heaviest rains occurring about June. In the hot season the thermometer reaches 61° Fahr.; in March and April it is not more than 49°. According to Burton the population of the city was only 8000, of whom 2500 were Somali and 3000 Arabs; but the Bulletin states the total at 35,000.

The Harari proper are of a distinct stock from the neighbouring peoples, and speak a special language. A small glossary in Salt’s Abyssinia, and another in the Philological Journal for 1845, were the only materials available for the investigation of the language previous to the publication of Burton’s sketch in his First Footsteps in North-Pastern Africa. By him it is maintained that the Hararese is semi-Semitic or, like the Galla, Dankali, and Somali, “a Semitic graft inserted into an indigenous stock;” and his opinion is followed by Bleek and Lepsius. The older statement, strongly supported by Burton, that the language is fundamentally Semitic, and has a special affinity with Amharic, has in its favour no less authorities than Friedrich Müller ^Sitzungsbericht der Wiener Akademie, Dec. 1863) and F. Praetorius (“Ueber die Sprache von Harar,” in Zeitschrift der deutschen Morgenland. Gesell., 1869). The Harari are Mahometans of the Shafa’i or Persian sect; and they employ the solar year and the Persian calendar. Monogamy prevails, and the women exercise great social influence; but the moral character of the people is said to be very low. It was in 1521 that Harar became a Mahometan city. Burton, the first European to put foot within its walls, spent ten days there in 1854-55, but it was only under the guise of an Arab that he was able to do so. Mohammed Mokhtar, the Egyptian general, has drawn up a sketch of the history of Harar from the native manuscripts brought with him to Cairo, and in company with Abd’ Allah Faouzi he has published a plan of the town in the Bulletin already quoted (Cairo, 1876).
