HARROGATE, a town and watering-place in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, is beautifully situated on a fine plateau near the River Nidd, 18 miles W. of York. It is indebted for its rise and importance to its medicinal springs, and is now the principal inland watering-place in the north of England. It consists of two scattered townships, Low Harrogate and High Harrogate, which have gradually been connected by a continuous range of handsome houses and villas. A common of 200 acres, which is secured by act of parliament from ever being built upon, stretches in front of the main line of houses, and on this account Harrogate, notwithstanding its rapid increase, has retained all its rural charm. As the town is equidistant from the east and west coasts, its air is supposed to possess certain special qualities, and there is the further advantage of a choice between the more bracing atmosphere of High Harrogate and the sheltered and warm climate of the low town. The waters are chalybeate, sulphureous, and saline, and some of the springs possess all these qualities to a greater or less extent. The principal chalybeate springs are the Tewitt well, called by Dr Bright, who wrote the first account of it, the “English Spa,” discovered by Captain William Slingsby of BiltonHall about the year 1570; the Royal Chalybeate Spa, more commonly known as John’s Well, discovered in 1631 by Dr Stanhope of York, and provided with a neat octagonal building erected in 1842; Muspratt’s chalybeate or chloride of iron spring discovered in 1819, but first properly analysed by Dr Sheridan Muspratt in 1865; and the Starbeck springs midway between High Harrogate and Knaresborough. The principal sulphur springs are the old sulphur well in the centre of Low Harrogate, discovered about the year 1656; the Montpellier springs, the principal well of which was discovered in 1822, situated in the grounds of the Crown Hotel and surmounted by a handsome building in the Chinese style containing pump-room, baths, and readingroom; and the Harlow Car springs, situated in a wooded glen about a mile west from Low Harrogate. Near Harlow Car is Harlow observatory, a square tower 100 feet in height, standing on elevated ground and commanding a very extensive view. A saline spring situated in Low Harrogate was discovered in 1783. Besides the hotels and churches, the principal public buildings are the High Harrogate college, a boarding-school for young gentlemen; the new Victoria baths, erected in 1871 at a cost of £20,000; the Bath hospital for poor patients, founded in 1824; and the Rogers almshouses, founded in 1869. About a mile to the south-east of Harrogate the Crymple valley is spanned by a railway viaduct 1850 feet in length. The population of the town in 1861 was 4737, and in 1871 6843.
