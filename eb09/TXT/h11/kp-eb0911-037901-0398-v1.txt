HAKODADI, or Hakodate, a seaport town of Japan, in the old province of Hokukaido, on the southern coast of the island of Yezo or Yesso, in 41° 49' N. lat. and 140° 47' E. long. Its general position, as has been frequently remarked, is not unlike that of Gibraltar, as the town is built along the north-western base of a rocky promontory (1100 feet in height) which forms the eastern boundary of a spacious bay, and is united to the mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus. At the time of Captain Perry’s visit in 1851 few of the buildings of Hakodadi, with the exception of its temples and fire-proof warehouses, were more than one story high, and the roofs were made of slight shingles protected against the effects of wind-storms by heavy stones.

Since that date the town has increased considerably in extent, and many of the more modern buildings, such as the new custom-house and the residences of the Government officials, have been erected in a more solid European style. In 1870 there were four European hotels. A new bund or embankment has been constructed along the shore, and several quarters of the town have been laid out in better fashion by the local authorities. Hakodadi is the residence of the governor of Yezo, and the seat of an arsenal. There are four Buddhist and three Shinto temples,—the most important of the former being the Zhioghen-zhi, or Country’s Protector, built about 1830. A medical college is maintained in connexion with the Government hospital, and in the neighbourhood of the town an agricultural college has been erected since 1873. The Bay of Hakodadi, says Sir Rutherford Alcock, is completely land-locked, easy of access, and spacious enough for the largest navies to ride in it, with deep water almost up to the shore, and good holdingground. The Russians have for a considerable time used it as a winter station for their ships, because their own harbours on the coast of Kamchatka are annually frozen up. Their establishment formerly comprised a handsome consular residence, a hospital, warehouses, and workshops, but the consulate was removed from the port in 1871. Hakodadi has a large local trade; but neither its exports nor its imports are very extensive, and as a commercial centre it will not improbably be superseded by Endermo. The exports comprise awabi, cuttlefish, sea-weed, bêche-demer (iriko), sea-otter skins, and deer horns; as many as 30,000 pairs of the last being sometimes shipped in a year. Lead and coal mines exist in the neighbourhood. There is telegraphic communication with Tokio (Yedo); and a new road has been made to Sapporu (Satsuporu). The population of the town is estimated at 30,000; in 1872 the foreign settlement had 22 residents. Hakodadi, originally a fishing village belonging to a local daimio, was purchased by the Government and incorporated in the imperial fief of Matsmai. It was opened to American commerce in 1854; and there are now also Danish, German, and English consuls. In 1868 the town was taken by the rebel fleet, but it was recovered by the mikado in 1869.
