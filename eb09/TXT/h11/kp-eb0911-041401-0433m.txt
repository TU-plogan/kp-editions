HAMILTON, Anthony or Antoine (1646-1720), a French classical author, who is especially noteworthy from the fact that, though by birth he was a foreigner, his literary characteristics are more decidedly French than those of many of the most indubitable Frenchmen. His father was George Hamilton, younger brother of James, second earl of Abercorn and head of the family of Hamilton in the peerage of Scotland, and sixth duke of Châtellerault in the peerage of France; and his mother was Mary Butler, sister of the duke of Ormonde. He was born in 1646, but the place of his birth has not been ascertained. According to some authorities it was Drogheda, but according to the London edition of his works in 1811 it was Roscrea in Tipperary county. From the age of four till he was fourteen the boy was brought up in France, whither his family had removed after the execution of Charles I. The fact that, like his father, he was a Roman Catholic, prevented his receiving the political promotion he might otherwise have expected on the Restoration, but he became a distinguished member of that brilliant band of courtiers whose most fitting portraiture was destined to be the product of his pen. His connexion with France was always maintained, and the marriaere of his sister to the Comte de Gramont rendered it more intimate if possible than before. On the accession of James he found his religious disabilities transformed into advantages. He obtained an infantry regiment in Ireland, and was appointed governor of Limerick. But the battle of the Boyne, at which he was present, brought disaster on all who were attached to the cause of the Stewarts, and before long he was again in France—an exile, but at home. The rest of his life was spent for the most part in the châteaux of his friends. With the duchess Ludovise of Maine he became an especial favourite, and it was at her seat at Sceaux that he wrote the Mémoires that made him famous. The ill-advised expedition of 1708 was the last political enterprise in which he shared, and he died at St Germain-en-Laye, August 6, 1720.

It is mainly, as has already been indicated, by the Mémoires du Comte de Grammont that Hamilton takes rank with the most classical writers of France. The work was first published anonymously in 1713 under the rubric of Cologne, but it was really printed in Holland, at that ti'-Je the great patroness of all questionable authors. An English translation by Boyer appeared in 1714. Upwards of thirty editions have since appeared, the best of the French being Renouard’s (1812) and Gustave Brunet’s (1859), and the best of the English Edward’s (1793), with 78 engravings, and Malleville’s (1811), with 64 portraits by Scriven and others. The original edition was reprinted by Pifteau in 1876. In imitation and satiric parody of the romantic tales which Galland’s translation of The Thousand and One NightshaA brought into favour in France, Hamilton wrote Le Bélin, Fleur d Épine, Zénéyde, and Les Quatre Facardins, which are characterized by the graceful ease of their style and the successful extravagance of their incidents. The first three tales appeared at Paris in 1730, ten years after the death of the author, and a collection of his Oeuvres Diverses in 1731 contained the unfinished “Zénéyde.” A collected edition of Hamilton’s works was published in six volumes in 1749, and was reprinted in 1762, 1770, 1776, and 1777. A translation of Pope’s Essay on Criticism, which procured the author a complimentary acknowledgment from the poet, is still in MSS., with the exception of a fragment printed in the 1812 edition of the works. In the name of his niece, the countess of Stafford, Hamilton maintained a witty correspondence with Lady Mary Wortley Montagu. See Notices of Hamilton in the 1862 edition of his works, and in Lescure’s edition of the Contes, Sainte-Beuve’s Causeries du Lundi (tom. i.), and Sayou’s Histoire de la littérature française à V étranger, 1853.
