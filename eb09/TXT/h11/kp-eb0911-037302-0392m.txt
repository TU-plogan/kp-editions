HAHN, Johann Georg von (1810-1869), an Austrian traveller, to whom we are indebted for most of our knowledge about the Albanians, was born at Jena in 1810. After travelling for some time under the auspices of the Vienna academy, he entered the Austrian consular service, in which he rose to be consul-general in Greece. He died at Jena 23d September 1869. In his great work Albanesischen Studien (Jena, 1854), he treats at once of the geography, the history, the arcliaeology, the linguistic affinities, and the folk-lore of this remarkable country and people; and the book at once took rank as a scholarly and authoritative production. He had previously (1851) published Bemerkungen über das Albanesische Alphabet (Vienna, 1851). In 1858 he undertook a journey along with Major F. Zach from Belgrade to Saloniki (Thessalonica), for the purpose mainly of ascertaining the feasibility of constructing a railway from the Danube to the Aegean; and an account of their experiences was published in the Denkschriften der Kaiserl, Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Wien, Phil. Hist. Klasse, Bd. xi., Vienna, 1861. This paper, reprinted in 1871, contained valuable matter in regard to the Albanians, and especially in regard to their geographical distribution. Another journey undertaken in 1863 furnished material for a second contribution to the Denkschriften {Phil. Hist. Klasse, 1867)—“Reise durch die Gebiete des Drin und Wardar.” Since the author’s death a large work has appeared under the title of Sagwissenschaftliche Studien (Jena, 1872-73), in which he deals learnedly with numerous questions in comparative mythology·
