HAMILTON, James (1769-1831), the author of the Hamiltonian system of teaching languages, was born in 1769 and died October 31, 1831. The first part of his life was spent in mercantile pursuits. Having settled in Hamburg and become free of the city, he was anxious to become acquainted with German and accepted the tuition of a French émigré, General D’Angelis. In twelve lessons he found himself able to read an easy German book, his master having discarded the use of a grammar and translated to him short stories word for word into French. As a citizen of Hamburg Hamilton started a business in Paris, and during the peace of Amiens maintained a lucrative trade with England; but at the rupture of the treaty he was mιde a prisoner of war, and though the protection of Hamburg was enough to get the words efface de la liste des prisonniers de guerre inscribed upon his passport, he was detained in custody till the close of hostilities. His business being thus ruined, he went in 1814 to America, intending to become a farmer and manufacturer of potash; but, changing his plan before he reached his “location,” he started as a teacher in New York. Adopting his old tutor’s method, he attained remarkable success in New York, Baltimore, Washington, Boston, Montreal, and Quebec. Returning to England in July 1823, he was equally fortunate in Manchester and elsewhere. His system attracted general attention, and was vigorously attacked and defended. In 1826 Sydney Smith devoted an article to its elucidation in the Edinburgh Review :—“We are strongly persuaded,” he said, “that, the time being given, this system will make better scholars, and, the degree of scholarship being given, a much shorter time will be needed” than in the ordinary system. As text-books for his pupils Hamilton printed interlinear tr anslations of the Gospel of John, of an Epitome historiae sacrae, of Aesop’s Fables, Eutropius, Aurelius Victor, Phaedrus, &c., and many books were issued as Hamiltonian with which he had nothing personally to do. The two master principles of his method, which has left its traces on our modern linguistic discipline, are that the language is to be presented to the scholar as a living organism, and that its laws are to be learned from observation and not by rules.
