HERSCHEL, Caroline Lucretia (1750-1848), sister of Sir William Herschel, the eighth child and fifth daughter of her parents, was born at Hanover on the 16th March 1750. On account of the prejudices of her mother, who did not desire her to know more than was necessary for being useful in the family, she received in youth only the first elements of education. After the death of her father in 1767 she, in order to fit herself to earn her bread, obtained permission to learn millinery and dressmaking, but continued to assist her mother in the management of the household until the autumn of 1772, when she accompanied to England her brother William, who had established himself as a teacher of music in Bath. At once she became a valuable co-operator with her brother, both in his professional duties and in the astronomical researches to which he had already begun to devote all his spare time. She was the principal singer at his oratorio concerts, and acquired such a reputation as a vocalist that she was offered an engagement for the Birmingham festival, which, however, she declined. When her brother accepted the office of astronomer-royal, she became his constant assistant in his observations, and also executed the laborious calculations which were connected with them. For these services she in 1787 received from the king a salary of £50 a year. Her chief amusement during her leisure hours was to sweep the heavens with a small Newtonian telescope planted on the lawn. Besides detecting by this means many of the small nebulae included in Sir William Herschel’s catalogue, she succeeded in discovering seven comets, in the discovery of five of which she could lay claim to priority, viz., those of 1786, 1788, 1791, 1793, and 1795. In 1797 she presented to the Royal Society a catalogue of 560 stars taken from Flamsteed’s observations, and not included in the British catalogue, together with a collection of errata that should be noticed in the same volume. Though she returned to Hanover in 1822 she did not abandon her astronomical studies, and in 1828 she completed the reduction, to January 1800, of 2500 nebulae discovered by her brother. In 1835 the Astronomical Society, to mark their sense of the benefits conferred on science by such a series of laborious exertions, unanimously resolved to present her with their gold medal, and also elected her an honorary member of the society. In 1846 she received a gold medal from the king of Prussia. She retained the use of her intellectual faculties, and also preserved her interest in science, to the close of a long life. Her death took place on 9th January, 1848. The Memoir and Correspondence of Caroline Herschel, by Mrs John Herschel, appeared at London in 1876.
