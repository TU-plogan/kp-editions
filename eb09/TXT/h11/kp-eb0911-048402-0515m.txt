HARO, said to be the ancient Castrum Bilium, a town of Spain, is situated in the province of Logrono, and the bishopric of Calahorra, 12 miles S.E. of Miranda, and 58 miles N. of Madrid. It occupies a beautiful site near the Ebro, in a fertile plain, bounded by a range of mountains. The town contains a fine parish church, a theatre built in 1841, a hospital, and other public buildings. Various unimportant manufactures are carried on by the inhabitants; but the chief source of wealth is the red wine produced in great abundance from the vines of the surrounding plain. There are some copper-mines in the neighbourhood. Haro was the birthplace of Diego de Leyva, the celebrated painter, about 1580. The population was estimated for 1870 at 6594.
