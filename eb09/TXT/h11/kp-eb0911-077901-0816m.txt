HESSE, or Hessia (in German Hessen), an old country of Germany, situated on both banks of the Rhine and Main, north and south of Frankfort, has had different boundaries at different times. Its greatest length was about 95 miles, while its breadth has varied considerably. Several detached portions of territory were also included in Hesse.

The earliest recorded inhabitants of the district were the Chatti, whose chief settlement Mattium, probably near Gudensberg, was destroyed by Germanicus in 15 a.d. The Chatti, merged in the Franks, migrated westward, and their place in Hesse was taken by the Saxons. Among these, when conquered by the German kings, several “gaus” or earldoms were founded, some of whose possessors after the death of Charlemagne rose to great power. Two families—those of Werner and of Giso, count of Gudensberg—became latterly the most important. In 1130 the heiress of the G isos married the landgrave of Thuringia, who thus became the overlord of Hesse. In 1247 the Thuringian male line became extinct, and Hesse, along with the other possessions of the landgrave, was involved in a prolonged war of succession. In 1263 Sophia, duchess of Brabant and niece of the last landgrave, received by treaty the landgraviate of Hesse, as it was from that time called, and two years later resigned it in favour of her son, Henry the Child, the ancestor of the present house of Hesse. Till the death of Philip the Magnanimous in 1567, Hesse continued to be regarded as one state, though sometimes shared by two rulers; but at that date Philip’s four sons divided the landgraviate into Hesse-Cassel, Hesse-Marburg, Hesse-Rheinfels, and Hesse-Darmstadt. Of these the second and third lapsed by inheritance in 1583 and 1604 to the others, which became the chief lines. The small landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg was formed in 1596 of part of Hesse-Darmstadt. Hesse-Darmstadt, since the annexation of the other two to Prussia in 1866, has been the only independent part of Hesse left, and generally receives the common name.

Hesse-Nassau is a province of Prussia, formed in 1866 from parts of Hesse-Cassel and the dukedom of Nassau. Hesse-Philippsthal was a collateral line of the house of Hesse-Cassel, founded in 1630, and extinct in 1820. Hess-Barchfeld, Hesse-Butzbach, Hesse-Rothenburg, Hesse-Rumpenheim, and Hesse-Wanfried were collateral lines of little importance.
