HILLAH, a town of Asiatic Turkey in the pashalik of Baghdad, from which town it lies 60 miles to the south. It is picturesquely situated, in the midst of a very fertile district, on both banks of the Euphrates, which are connected there by a floating bridge 450 feet in length. The estimated population, which includes a large number of Jews, varies from 6000 to much above 10,000. The bazaars are large and well supplied; and tanning, dyeing, and silk manufacture are carried on to a considerable extent. The horse mart has recently declined in repute. Hillah occupies the site of the ancient Babylon, and is to a large extent built of bricks obtained from the ruins.
