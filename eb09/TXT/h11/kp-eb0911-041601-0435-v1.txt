HAMILTON, Thomas (1789-1842), the author of Cyril Thornton, was the younger brother of Professor Sir William Hamilton, Bart., and was born in 1789. In his early years he acquired a thorough mastery of the classics, and notwithstanding that he entered the artillery and was engaged in active service throughout the Peninsular and American campaigns, he continued to cultivate his literary tastes. On the conclusion of peace he withdrew, with the rank of captain, from active professional duties, and amused his leisure hours with the congenial pastime of literature. He was a frequent contributor to Blackwood’s Magazine from its commencement, his papers manifesting great variety and versatility of talent, and embracing both prose and poetry. The most important and popular of his contributions to that periodical was the military novel Cyril Thornton, whose deficiency of plot is sufficiently compensated for by the interest of its details, its vivacity of movement, its truthful and clever delineation of character, and its easy, fresh, and graceful style. His Annals of the Peninsular Campaign, published originally in 1829, and republished in 1849 with additions by Frederick Hardman, though too condensed to leave room for graphic description, is written with great clearness and impartiality. His only other work, Men and Manners in America, published originally in 1832, is the result of much careful observation, and its criticisms, though frank and outspoken, and somewhat coloured by British prejudice, are always expressed with courtesy and good taste. He died at Pisa, December 7, 1842.
