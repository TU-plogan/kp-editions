HAMILTON, Patrick (1504-1528), son of Sir Patrick Hamilton, well known in Scottish chivalry, and of Catherine Stewart, daughter of Alexander duke of Albany, second son of James II. of Scotland, was born in the diocese of Glasgow, probably at his father’s estate of Stonehouse in Lanarkshire. Of his early boyhood and education nothing is known. In 1517 he was appointed titular abbot of Ferne, Ross-shire; and it was probably about the same year that he went to study at Paris, for his name is found in an ancient list of those who graduated there in 1520. It was doubtless during this period that he received the germs of the doctrines he was afterwards so nobly to uphold. From Ales we learn that Hamilton subsequently went to Louvain, attracted probably by the fame of Erasmus, who in 1521 had his headquarters there. Returning to Scotland, the young scholar naturally selected St Andrews, the capital of the church and of learning, as his residence. On the 9th June 1523 he became a member of the university of St Andrews, and on the 3d October 1524 he was admitted to its faculty of arts. There Hamilton attained such influence that he was permitted to conduct in the cathedral a musical mass of his own composition. But the Reformed doctrines had now obtained a firm hold on the young abbot, and he was eager to communicate them to his fellow-countrymen. Early in 1527 the archbishop Beatoun’s attention was directed to the heretical preaching of the young priest, whereupon he ordered that Hamilton should be formally summoned and accused. Hamilton fled to Germany, first visiting Luther at Wittenberg, and afterwards enrolling himself as a student, under Francis Lambert of Avignon, in the new university of Marburg, opened May 30, 1527, by Philip, landgrave of Hesse. Frith and Tyndale were among those whom he met there. Late in the autumn of 1527 Hamilton returned to Scotland, bold in the truth of his principles. He went first to his brother’s house at Kincavel, near Linlithgow, in which town he preached frequently, and soon afterwards he married a young lady of noble rank, whose name has not come down to us. Beatoun, avoiding open violence through fear of Hamilton’s high connexions, invited him to a conference at St Andrews. The reformer resolutely accepted the invitation, and for nearly a month was permitted to preach freely. At length, however, he was summoned before a council of bishops and clergy presided over by the archbishop; and though he clearly and calmly answered all the written charges brought against him, his replies gave ground for new accusations of heresy. The council eagerly convicted him, and handed him over to the secular power. The sentence was carried out on the same day (February 29, 1528) lest he should be rescued by his friends, and he was burned at the stake as a heretic. His courageous bearing attracted more attention than ever to the doctrines for which he suffered, and greatly helped to spread the Reformation in Scotland.

Hamilton left a short treatise showing the antithesis between the law and the gospel. Frith’s translation of it, under the name of “Patrick’s Places,” is to be found in Foxe’s Acts and Monuments. Patrick Hamilton, the first Preacher and Martyr of the Scottish Reformation, by the Rev. Peter Lorimer, was published at Edinburgh in 1857.
