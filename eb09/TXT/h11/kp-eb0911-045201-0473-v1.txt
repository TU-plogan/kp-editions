HANSTEEN, Christopher (1784-1873), astronomer and physicist, was born at Christiania, Norway, September 26, 1784. From the cathedral school he went to the university at Copenhagen, where first law and afterwards mathematics formed his main study. In 1806 he taught mathematics in the gymnasium of Frederiksborg, Zeeland, and the following year he commenced the inquiries in his f ιvoαrite branch of science—terrestrial magnetism—which have made his name famous. He took in 1812 the prize of the Danish Royal Academy of Sciences for his reply to a question on the magnetic axes. Appointed lecturer in 1814, he was in 1816 raised to the chair of astronomy and applied mathematics in the university of Christiania. In 1819 he published his researches on terrestrial magnetism, a work which attracted the notice of the physicists of Europe and particularly of England, where the search for a formula by which the variation of the needle might be found at any given time and place was being actively pursued. The researches were translated into German by P. T. Hanson, under the title Untersuchungen über den Magnetismus der Erde, with a supplement containing Beobachtungen der Abweichung und Neigung der Magnetnadeln and an atlas. The rules there framed for the observation of magnetical phenomena have been generally followed. Hansteen hoped by them to accumulate analyses for determining the number and position of the magnetic poles of the earth. In prosecution of his researches he visited London, and also Paris and other Continental cities, and travelled over Finland and the greater part of his own country; and in 1828-30 he undertook, in company with Ermann and Due, and with the cooperation of Russia, a Government mission to Western Siberia, the chief aim of which was to find the ideal point of the Asiatic pole of magnetism—ten observatories being established in Russia to further the project. The scientific results—magnetic, astronomic, and meteorological—form the bases of many valuable theories. A narrative of the personal adventures soon appeared (Reise-Erinnerungen aus Sibirien , 1854; Souvenirs Tun voyage en Sibérie, 1857); but the chief work was not issued till 1863 (Resultate magnetischer Beobachtungen, &c.). Shortly after the return of the mission, an observatory was erected in the park of Christiania (1833), and Hansteen was appointed director. On his representation a magnetic observatory was added in 1839. In 1835-38 his text-books on geometry and mechanics were published; and in 1842 he wrote his Disquisitiones de mτιtationibus quas patitur momentum acns magneticoe, &c. He also contributed various papers to different scientific journals, especially the Magazin for Naturvidenskaberne, of which he became joint-editor in 1823. He superintended the trigonometrical and topographical survey of Norway, begun in 1837. He was a member of the Royal Society of London, the French Institute, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Academies of Berlin and St Petersburg. In 1861 he retired from active work, but still pursued his studies, his Observations de l ’ inclinat ion magnétique and Sur les variations séculaires du magnétisme appearing in 1865. Hansteen died at Christiania, April 15, 1873.
