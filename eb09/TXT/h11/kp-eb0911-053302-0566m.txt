HAWES, William (1785-1846), an English musician of some merit, is remembered chiefly by the fact that through his instrumentality Weber’s Der Freischütz was for the first time performed in England. This event took place July 24, 1824, and led eventually to Weber’s removal to London. Hawes was born in London in 1785, and was for eight years (1793-1801) a chorister of the Chapel Royal, where he studied music chiefly under Dr Ayrton. He subsequently held various musical posts, being in 1817 appointed master of the children of the Chapel Royal. He also, in conjunction with Welsh, carried on the business of a music publisher, and was for many years musical director of the Lyceum Theatre, then devoted to English opera. It was in the last-named capacity that he introduced Weber’s masterpiece, at first slightly curtailed, but soon afterwards in its entirety. Winter’s Interrupted Sacrifice, Mozart’s Cosi fan Tutte, Marschner’s Vampyre, and other important works were also brought out under his auspices. Hawes also wrote or compiled the music for numerous pieces, none of which however has survived or deserves mention. Better were his glees and madrigals, of which he published several collections. He also superintended a new edition of the celebrated Triumph of Oriana. Hawes died February 18, 1846.
