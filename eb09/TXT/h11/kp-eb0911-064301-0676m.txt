HELVIDIUS PRISCUS lived in the 1st century, during the reigns of Nero, Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian. In those evil days he won the respect of all good men by his fearless love of freedom. Among the cringing and obsequious senators of Rome he dared to be sincere and outspoken. Tacitus says of him (Hist., iv. 5) that in his early youth he devoted his great abilities to the highest pursuits, and made it his object to enter on public life with a spirit thoroughly fortified against all contingencies. It was natural that such a man should be a warm adherent of the Stoic school of philosophy. His father-in-law, Thrasea Paetus, had been the same; he had been driven to suicide in Nero’s reign, and his last words to Helvidius were—· “Young man, you have been born into times in which it is well to brace the spirit with examples of courage” (Tacitus, Annals, xvi. 35). Although he repeatedly offended the emperor, he held several high offices. During Nero’s reign he was quaestor in the province of Achaia; he was also sent into Armenia in command of a legion, and by his good sense and moderation he succeeded in restoring peace and order in that country. By the provincials he was respected and trusted. His well-known sympathies with such men as Brutus and Cassius occasioned his banishment in 66 A.D., and he lived with his wife Fannia in Macedonia until Nero’s death. Having been recalled to Rome by Galba in 68 a.d., he at once impeached Eprius Marcellus, one of the most villanous of the informers, and the very man who had been the accuser of Thrasea Paetus. After an angry debate he dropped the charge, as the condemnation of Marcellus would have involved a host of senators in like ruin. As praetor-elect he bad once the courage to oppose Vitellius in the senate, and again as praetor in the following year he ventured to argue against the financial policy of Vespasian. Such matters, he maintained, ought to be left to the discretion of the senate. He proposed that the Capitol, which had been destroyed in the Neronian conflagration, should be restored at the public cost. It would seem that he rather perversely went out of his way to insult Vespasian, saluting him by his private name, and not recognizing him as emperor in the edicts he had to publish as praetor. There was very possibly in all this some of the affectation which often characterized the Stoics. The end of it was that he was banished, his wife Fannia, whose constancy and virtue are highly commended by his friend the younger Pliny, going with him into exile. Shortly afterwards he was executed by Vespasian’s order. His life was written at his widow’s request by Herennius Senecio; it took the form of a warm panegyric, and proved fatal to its author in the reign of Domitian.
