HAJDUK, sometimes corrupted into Heyduke, is the plural form of the Magyar word Hajdιi, and was formerly used as the collective name of the undermentioned towns (along with Vâmos-Pércs, population 3000) of the old privileged Hajdùk district of Hungary, now included in the county of Hajdù.

Hajdù Böszörmeny, the second town in importance of Hajdιi county, lies about 11 miles to the N.W. of Debreczin, 47° 4Γ N. lat., 21° 3Γ E. long. It is the seat of a royal court of law, and was formerly the capital of the Hajdùk district. Among the principal buildings are the old district court-house, a Greek Catholic and two Calvinist churches, a Protestant gymnasium, the post and telegraph offices, and the savings bank. The fairs periodically held in the town attract people from a considerable distance. Population (1870) 19,208.

Hajdu-Dorog is a market-town situated about 10 miles to the N. of Bôszôrmény, with a Greek Catholic and a Calvinist church. At Dorog the Magyar adherents of the Greek Catholic Church are met with in great numbers. Population 8216.

Hajdu-Hadhâz is a corporate town lying about 10 miles N of Debreczin. It has a Calvinist church, post and telegraph offices, and a station on the railway from Nyiregyhâza to Debreczin. Population 7024.

Hajdù-Nânâs is a market-town, about 24 miles N.N.W. of Debreczin, with a large Calvinist church, a high school for girls, and a Protestant gymnasium. The surrounding country, although on the whole productive, assumes in the west a generally swampy character. Population 13,198.

Hajdû-Szoboszlo is a corporate town, 12 miles to the S.W. of Debreczin, with which it is connected by railway. Among the principal buildings are a Calvinist church and school, and a royal law-court. Population 12,269.

The Hajdιik district was made over to the Hajdùks in 1605, with special privileges and the rights of nobility, by the Transylvanian prince Stephen Bocskay, as a reward for military service rendered him in his revolutionary campaigns. The inhabitants were confirmed in their possessions by the diet of 1613. From 1849 to 1860 the district was united to the county of North Bihar, but it afterwards received a separate cantonal organization. It now forms the principal portion of the new county of Hajdιi, constituted in 1876, and including, along with the old Hajdùk district, portions of the neighbouring counties of Szabolcs and Bihar. Debreczin is the capital, and the population is computed at about 163,000, mostly Magyars.
