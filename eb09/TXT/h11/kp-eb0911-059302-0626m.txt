HEBE, in Greek mythology, is a personification of the blooming freshness and youth of nature. Originally she appears almost identical with the pure Greek Aphrodite (as distinguished from the Oriental goddess). Hebe is the daughter of Zeus and Hera, as Aphrodite of Zeus and Dione; but Dione and Hera are only two names for the Bame goddess. Like Aphrodite, Hebe is called the most beautiful of the gods (Pind., N., 10, 17). In Sicyon and Phlius Hebe is called Dia, a regular epithet of Aphrodite. In Phlius, where Hebe was worshipped on the citadel in a temple where no image of her was allowed and to which right of asylum was attached, a festival called κLσσοτοpοL was celebrated to her every year; and ivy was sacred also to Aphrodite. It is in accordance with the close resemblance between Aphrodite and Core that Hebe also has many points of analogy with the latter, to whom she is compared by Gerhard and Weicker (Gr. Giiti., i. 369). According to the custom for the unmarried daughters of a family, Hebe acts in the Homeric poems as a sort of attendant to the gods and especially to her own mother Hera. She offers the cup to the gods, just as on earth the women, and especially the youngest daughter, did to guests and to warriors departing or returning. She bathes Ares (ZZ., V. 905), as Polycaste does Telemachus. She harnesses the horses for Hera (7Γ., v. 722). She appears very often in connexion with the worship of Hera. A statue of her by Naucydes stood beside the Hera of Polyclitus in the Heraeum at Argos. Praxiteles placed statues of her and Athene beside that of Hera in the temple at Mantinea, and Kekulé (Hebe) maintains that the artistic conception of Hebe which prevailed in the finest period of Greek art was a slight modification of that of Hera, and he believes that a bust, now in private possession, is the single remaining example of its kind. Weicker’s opinion that the so-called Farnese Flora is really a Hebe has not been generally accepted. In later art she is often represented, like Ganymedes, caressing the eagle; and it is possible that the epithet Ganymeda, by which she was called in Phlius, is not really ancient, but arises from the supposed analogy of her office with that of Ganymedes. The meaning of the w ord Hebe tended to transform the goddess into a mere personification of the eternal youth that belongs to the gods, and this conception is frequently met with. Then she becomes identical with the Roman Juventas, who is simply an abstraction of an attribute of Jupiter Juventus, the god of increase and blessing and youth. By a most transparent allegory it was said that Juventas and Terminus alone of all the gods refused to give way when the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was being built. Perhaps the most interesting point about Hebe is her connexion with Heracles. When he was received among the gods and reconciled to Hera, Hebe was given him in marriage. This legend appears only in a doubtful line of Homer (Od., xi. 603); but Hesiod (Th., 950) and Pindar (N., 10, 17) also know it. They were worshipped together in the Cynosarges at Athens, and represented side by side on the Amyclaean throne. The apotheosis of Heracles and his marriage with Hebe became a favourite subject with poets and painters. Many instances occur on vases, though several of those enumerated by Kekulé are otherwise explained by other writers on art.
