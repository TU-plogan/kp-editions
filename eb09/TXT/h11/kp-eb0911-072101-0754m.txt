HERBERT, George (1593-1633), one of the best of English religious poets, was born near the town of Montgomery on the 3d of April 1593. He was a brother of Lord Herbert of Cherbury, noticed below. Educated privately till the age of twelve, he was then sent to Westminster School, and in 1608 he became a student at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was made B.A. in 1611, M.A. and major fellow of the college in 1615, and orator for the university in 1619. In his capacity as orator he was several times brought into contact with King James. About the same time also he appeared as the champion of Anglicanism against Andrew Melville, the famous Scotch Presbyterian. He numbered among his friends Dr Donne, Sir Henry Wotton, Izaak Walton, Bishop Andrewes, and Francis Bacon, who consulted Herbert about several of his works, and dedicated to him his translation of the Psalms. During his youth he was a courtier, dancing attendance on King James, and “enjoying his genteel humour for clothes”; and the king rewarded his attentions by the gift of a sinecure worth £120 a year. The death of his patrons the duke of Richmond, the marquis of Hamilton, and King James, approaching ill-health, and the influence of his mother finally induced him, not without a struggle, to take holy orders. In July 1626 he was appointed prebendary of Layton Ecclesia, in the county of Huntingdon. Shortly before his induction (1630) to the parsonage of Bemerton, near Salisbury, he married Miss Jane Danvers after three days’ acquaintance. Mr Danvers had been set on the marriage for a long time, and had often spoken of his daughter Jane to Herbert, and “so much commended Mr Herbert to her, that Jane became so much a Platonic as to fall in love with Mr Herbert unseen.” The story of the poet’s life at Bemerton, as told by Walton, is one of the most exquisite pictures in literary biography. He devoted much time to explaining the meaning of the various parts of the PrayerBook, and held services twice every day, at which many of the parishioners attended, and some “let their plough rest when Mr Herbert’s saints-bell rung to praise, that they might also offer their devotions to God with him.” Next to Christianity itself he loved the English Church. He was passionately fond of music, and usually went twice a week to attend the cathedral service at Salisbury. Walton illustrates Herbert’s kindness to the poor by many touching anecdotes. He had not been three years in Bemerton when he succumbed to ill-health. He died in 1633.

Herbert’s works are— The Temple (1631); a few miscellaneous poems; a collection of proverbs entitled Jacula Prudentum (1640); and The Country Parson, which did not appear till 1652. The Temple is a collection of religious poems marked by unity of sentiment and inspiration. The chief faults of the book are obscurity, verbal conceits, and a forced ingenuity which shows itself in grotesque puns, odd metres, and occasional want of taste. In spite of these drawbacks, the quaint beauty of Herbert’s style and his genuine poetical feeling give The Temple a high place in literature. The following poems are the gems of the collection “The Church Porch,” “The Agony,” “Sin,” “Sunday,” “Virtue,” “Man,” “The British Church,” “The Quip,” “The Collar,” “The Pulley,” “The Flower,” “Aaron,” and “The Elixir.” The finest of all is his poem on “Man,” which is Miltonic in its sublimity of conception, and shows how poets, in their loftier moods, often anticipate the discoveries of science and the most far-reaching speculations of philosophy. Herbert and Kehle are the poets of Anglican theology. No book is fuller of devotion vθ the Church of England than The Temple. No poem in our language exhibits more of the spirit of true Christianity. Every page is marked by transparent sincerity, and reflects the beautiful character of “holy George Herbert.”

Among recent editions of Herbert’s works the following may be mentioned :— Works in Prose and Verse, with life by Izaak Walton, and notes by 8. T. Coleridge, 1846; Gilfillan’s edition, in his “Library of the British Poets,” 1853; Willmott’s edition, 1854; Professor Nichol’s edition, 1863; and the Aldine edition by the Rev. Dr A. B. Grosart. For further information consult Walton’s Life, and England's Antiphon, by George Macdonald, 1871.
