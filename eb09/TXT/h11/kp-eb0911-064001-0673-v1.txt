HELSINGBORG, a town of Sweden, province of Skane and län of Malmö, is beautifully situated at the narrowest part of the Sound—there only 3 miles wide— opposite Elsinore, and 32 miles N.N.W. of Malmö. It is connected with the Swedish railway by a branch line to Hessleholm and Eslöf, and it has regular communication with Denmark by steamer. The harbour, completed in 1832, is sufficient for vessels of an ordinary size. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in fishing, commerce, and agriculture. Corn is the principal export. A short distance north-east of the town there is a mineral spring, and about 2 miles south-east are the more famous wells of Ramlösa. The sea-baths to the north of the town are much frequented in summer. At Höganäs, about a mile and a half north, there are extensive coal-mines and also a pottery. The population, which in 1800 was only 1761, in 1860 was 5053, and in 1876 had reached 10,066.

Helsingborg is one of the oldest towns of Sweden. The original site is marked by the tower of Kärnan {i e. the chum), which was probably the strongest in the old fortress first mentioned in the year 1135. In the 14th century it was several times besieged. From 1370 it, along with the other towns of Skane, was joined for fifteen years to the Hanseatic League. The fortress having been laid waste by fire in 1418, King Eric of Pomerania about 1425 built a new fortress near the sea, and caused the town to be transplanted thither, bestowing upon it at the same time important privileges. Until 1658 it belonged to Denmark, and it was again occupied by the Danes in 1676 and 1677. In 1684 its fortifications were dismantled. It was retaken by Frederick IV. of Denmark in November 1709; but his troops, under General Rantzau, were severely defeated near it by General Stenbock, 10th March 1710, from which time it has remained in the possession of Sweden. In 1711 it was again bombarded by the Danes.
