HEAD, Sir Edmund Walker, Bart., (1805-1868), a popular writer on art, was born in 1805 at Wiarton Place, near Maidstone in Kent. He was educated at Winchester school and Oriel College, Oxford, and taking his degree with first-class honours in classics, he became in 1827 fellow of Merton College, and in 1834 university examiner in classics. Two years later he married; and on his father’s deιth in 1838, he succeeded to the baronetcy as eighth baronet. His services as poor-law commissioner, to which post he was appointed in 1841 after three years as assistant-commissioner, procured for him in 1847 the office of lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick, whence he passed in 1854 to the governor-generalship of Canada, which he retained till 1861. The following year, having returned to England, Head was nominated a civil-service commissioner. In 1857 he was sworn of the Privy Council, and in 1860 was decorated as K.C.B., while in the course of his career he received the degrees of D.C.L. at Oxford and LL.D, at Cambridge. He died in London, January 28, 1868.

Sir Edmund Head wrote the article “Painting,” in the Benny Cyclopaedia; A Handbook of the Spanish and French Schools of Painting, 1845; Shall and, Will, or two chapters on future Auxiliary Verbs, 1856; and Ballads and other Poems, original and translated, 1868. He also edited A Handbook of Painting of the German, Flemish, Dutch, Spanish, and French Schools, 1854. His translation from the Icelandic of Viga Glum's Saga appeared in 1865.
