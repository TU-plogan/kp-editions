HEREROLAND, or Damaraland, a region of SouthWestern Africa, stretching north from the Kuisip to the Cunene, so called from the native race known to the Namaqua as Herero and to the Cape colonists as Damara (Damra, or Dama). The north-west portion is also known as Kaokoland.

According to the treaty of Okahandya, by which, in 1876, the country came in some sort under British protection,^[1. See Damara and Namaqua Land: Report of W. Coates Palgrave, Esq., special commissioner to the tribes north of the Orange River, of his mission to Damaraland and Great Namaqualand in 1876, Cape Town, 1877. ] the boundary line is fixed as coinciding in the south with the line of latitude passing through Rehoboth or Annis (a mission station in 17° 5' E. long, and about 165 miles from the coast), thence in a straight line to Otyimbinde (Tunobis or Riet Fontein), in 20° 53' E. long, and 22° 5' S. lat., thence northwards to Otyiondarmie, and finally from that place westwards along the 0muramba Ovambo to the Cunene. The territory thus defined has an estimated area of 100,000 square miles; and of this about 35,000 square miles were marked out as a British reservation, bounded by a line drawn from Rehoboth to Otyimbinde, thence north-west to Otyituo, about 19° E. long, and 20° S. lat., thence west to Otyahevita, and south to the neighbourhood of Mount Erongo. According to Palgrave the total population of Hereroland is 121,150, of whom 85,000 are Hetero proper, 30,000 Hill Damara, 3000 Bushmen, 1500 Namaqua, 1500 Bastards, and 150 Europeans. In a paper in Petermaun's Mittheilungen, 1878, based on information from the Rhenish missionaries, the total is given as 184,000, of whom 110,000 are Herero (80,000 Ova Herero and 30,000 Ova-mbanderu), [9:11:732] 50,000 Hill Damara, 2500 Namaqua, 2000 Bastards, 20,000 Bushmen, and 300 whites.

Hereroland has a coast-line of 460 miles, but the only point where it offers shelter and access to ships is Walfish Bay, a safe but comparatively shallow harbour formed by Pelican Point immediately to the south of the mouth of the Kuisip. The country consists of three distinct physical regions—first, a long and narrow coast district backed by a very regular line of hills, of which the highest point appears to be Mount Messum or Dourissa; secondly, a broad mountainous tract, containing in the south such peaks as Omatako, 8800 feet, Ombotozu (Diambotodzu), 7300, Etyo, 4000, and far in the north Etendeka, 4000; and thirdly, a steppe region which stretches away into the Kalahari desert. The rivers of Hereroland, of which the most important, passing from south to north, are the Tsoachaub, the Eisib or Omaruru, the Ugab, and the Huab, are mere wadies, which only at intervals succeed in bringing water as far as the sea. Except in the half-dry river-beds, the coast district is almost destitute of vegetation, the only edible fruit being the nara, which grows on the sand-downs, and is, according to Anderson, eaten by oxen, mice, men, ostriches, and lions. In the mountainous tract there are places of considerable fertility; large trees, as sycamores, &c., grow along the river-beds, and euphorbias, tamarisks, and a variety of strong-spined bushes prevail. In a few favoured spots wheat can be cultivated, and from a single grain as many as 150 stalks may be produced. The coast range and many of the mountains, such as Okonyonyo and Amatako, are composed of granite and gneiss, broken by intrusive quartz and porphyry; further east limestone formations, both Carboniferous and Oolitic, are predominant; and these again give place to sandstone strata, which are weathered into table-shaped eminences. The granite and gneiss are being disintegrated with great rapidity. Both iron and copper are said to occur in considerable abundance, though the mineral exploitation of the country has had no satisfactory result. About 25 mineral springs, both hot and cold, are known to exist among the mountains.

An interesting sketch of the climate was contributed by Dr A. von Danckelmann to the Zeitschr. der öslerr. Gesellsch. fur Meteor., 1878. Owing, it would appear, to the cold current in the neighbouring sea, the coast region is almost rainless; though occasionally, in the rainy season of the interior, storm-clouds with thunder and lightning come from the east, and from September to March south-west winds laden with heavy mist blow almost without interruption. In the interior the year is divided into a regular dry and wet season, the former lasting from May to November. From September onwards the air is so clear that the planet Venus can be distinguished at midday, and every object looks so distinct that it is almost impossible to calculate distances correctly. Even during the rainy season the nights are usually cloudless. Not unfrequently before the beginning of the rains “sand-spouts,” or, as they are called by the natives, Kumb’anhara or “rain-beggars,” drive across the country. No support is afforded by the observations in Hereroland to the theory of the periodicity of African rain in accordance with the changes of the sun spots; but there would seem to be a gradual decrease of atmospheric precipitation. From September to December the east wind usually blows in the morning, but it passes round to the north-west in the forenoon. From. December to April the east is decidedly predominant. Snow is extremely rare, but night frosts occur several times a year, and ice has been found inch thick. In the dry season the daily range of the thermometer is from 32° or 36° Fahr, to 75° or 79°; in the rainy season from 86° or 95° to 68° or 82°.

The Herero are the dominant race. They are well-formed, of good stature, and of regular features. Their complexion is usually dark but not black; but there is sufficient variety to lead them to classify themselves into the Ovathorondu or “red folks” andtheθvatherandu or “dark folks.” Their scanty clothingconsists mainly of skins and leather thongs, and both their garments and their bodies are thickly smeared with ochre and grease. The women’s head-dress is a curious three-eared helmet. Assegais, bows and arrows, and knobsticks or kieries are the native weapons, but guns and even breechloaders are growing not uncommon. The whole race is in the pastoral etage, and some of the chiefs possess very extensive property in cattle. The various clans or “uandas” have each its own totem; and thus to one man it is a sin to partake of the flesh of a red cow and to another a one-horned sheep is equally sacred. By their language (Otyiherero) the Herero belong to the great Bantu family. For our acquaintance with it we are mainly indebted to the Rhenish missionaries, and more particularly to Dr Hahn, who published Grτιηdzuge einer Grammatik der Herero, Berlin, 1857. A spelling book (Cape Town, 1848) appears to be the earliest work printed in the tongue.

The Herero would seem to have come from the north, and tl·xey probably first appeared to the south of the Cunene about 150 years ago, to the dismay of the Hill Damara (Houquoin, lhaukoin, Ova-zoratu, or Ghoudamoup), a peculiar race who now occupy the fastnesses of the country, and speak the Nama or Hottentot language with a foreign accent, though there is no tradition of their having used any other. The Herero were subjugated by Jonker Afrikaner, and for a time were scattered among the Namaqua tribes, but about 1865 they recovered their independence. They are still unfriendly to the Hill Damara, who steal their cattle, and they are beginning to hunt down the Bushmen. A single tribe of the Namaqua, which sided with them in their war of liberty, is still settled near Mount Erongo.
