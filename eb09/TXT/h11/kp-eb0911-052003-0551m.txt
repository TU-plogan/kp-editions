HATTINGEN, a town of Westphalia, Prussia, in the government district of Arnsberg and the circle of Bochum, is situated on the river Ruhr, about 21 miles N.E. of DÃ¼sseldorf. It is the seat of a commission of justice, and possesses a good school. The manufactures comprise cloth, woollen and silk goods, tobacco, iron, and steel. In the town are large iron-works, a brewery, and a brandy distillery. There are iron-stone and coal mines in the neighbourhood, and the scanty remains of the Isenburg, demolished in 1226. Hattingen was one of the Hanse towns of the Middle Ages. Its population in 1875 was 6995.
