HILAR ΓON, St, abbot, the first to introduce the monastic system into Palastine, was born of heathen parents at Tabatha, about 5 miles to the south of Gaza, about the yeιr 288, was sent when very young to Alexandria to be educated, and there became a convert to the Christian religion. Attracted by the fame of St Anthony, he went to visit that saint in his solitude, and forthwith became a disciple. Returning to Palestine with some companions while still but a lad of fifteen, he gave away all the property he had inherited by the recent death of his parents, and then withdrew into loneliness in the desert between the sea and the marshes on the Egyptian border. In this solitude he observed the most rigid asceticism, and (to quote the quaint remark of Butler) “thought himself at liberty to practise certain mortifications which the respect we owe to our neighbour makes unseasonable in the world.” Twenty years of patient continuance in the way of life he had chosen for himself were rewarded, we are told, with miraculous gifts and with rapidly growing fame; disciples and imitators multiplied to the number of two or three thousand, and all owned the spiritual oversight of Hilarion. Informed by revelation when sixty-five years old of the death of Anthony, he undertook an extended tour into Egypt, where he visited all the scenes of that saint’s labours; afterwards he removed in the company of a favourite disciple, Hesychius, into Sicily, where, however, his popularity rendered impossible the quiet and retirement which were congenial to his habits; a further migration to Epidaurus thus became necessary; and ultimately he found a resting-place in Cyprus, the diocese of his old friend Epiphanius, where in a lonely cell amongst some almost inaccessible rocks he died in 371. According to Sozomen his festival was observed in Palestine with great solemnity as early as the 5th century; he is now commemorated by the Roman Church on October 21st. His earliest biographers were Epiphanius and Jerome.
