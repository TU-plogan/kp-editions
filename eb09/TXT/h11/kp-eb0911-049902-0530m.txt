HARTMANN, Moritz (1821-1872), a German poet and novelist, was born of Jewish parents at Duschnik in Bohemia, October 15, 1821. He studied at Prague and Vienna, and after a tour in Italy, Switzerland, and South Germany became a teacher in Vienna. He left Austria, however, in 1844, in order to publish without danger a volume of patriotic poems entitled Kelch und Schwert, which appeared at Leipsic in 1845, and in which .he gave expression to somewhat radical sentiments as regards both church and state, in language full of the fire of youthful passion and tinged with considerable poetic fancy. After residing for some years in Belgium and France, he came to Leipsic, where in 1847 he published Neuere Gedichte. On his venturing towards the close of this year to return to Austria he suffered a short imprisonment, from which he was freed by the revolution of the following March. In the same year he was chosen to represent the district of Leitmeritz in the Frankfort parliament, where he took his seat on the extreme left. In October he accompanied Blum and Fröbel to Vienna, but he made his escape before the execution of Blum, and took part in the deliberations of the “Rump Parliament” at Stuttgart. In 1849 he published the Reimchronik des Pfafen Maurizius, a satirical political poem in the style of the old chronicles. After the dissolution of the “Rump Parliament,” he went to Switzerland, then to England and Ireland, and in 1850 to Paris, where, besides other literary engagements, he held that of correspondent to the Kölnische Zeitung. On the outbreak of the Russian war he became correspondent of the same paper in the Crimea, where he remained eighteen months. After several years’ residence at Paris he settled in 1860 at Ghent, where he delivered courses of lectures on German literature and history in some of the principal academies. In 1863 he removed to Stuttgart to edit the Freya, and in 1868 he undertook the editorship at Vienna of the Neue Freie Presse. He died at Oberdöbling near Vienna, May 13, 1872. Hartmann published several volumes of poems in addition to those already mentioned, and besides his spirited accounts of his travels and adventures he is the author of various novels of more than average merit. A series of tales (Novellen, 3 vols.) appeared in 1863, and a second series (Nach Natur, 3 vols.) in 1866. His collected works were published at Stuttgart in 10 vols., 1873-74, and a selection of his poems at the same place in 1874.
