HEBRON, the most southern of the three cities of refuge west of Jordan (Josh. xx. 7), built “seven years before Zoan (Tanis) in Egypt” (Num. xiii. 22). Tanis, according to Brugsch, was standing at least 2100 years b.c. Hebron was originally called Mamre and Kirjath Arba, after Arba, one of the Anakiιn (Josh. xiv. 15), It is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament (Gen. xiii. 18 and xxiii. 19; 2 Sam. iii. 20 and v. 5). The present town encloses the Haram or sanctuary built over the supposed site of Machpelah; but if this site be (as seems probable) genuine, the ancient Hebron must have faced the cave, as is remarked by many ancient writers (Gen. xxiii. 17). The name Machpelah signifies “place of division,” and the cave was therefore called as early as the 6th century Spelunca Duplex. In the 12th century an iron door (still visible) is mentioned as leading from the Haram wall to the cavern. In 1167 a d. Hebron became the see of a Latin bishop, and it was taken in 1187 by Saladin. In 1834 it joined the rebellion against Ibrahim Pasha, who took the town and pillaged it. Modern Hebron rises on the east slope of a shallow valley—a long narrow town of stone houses, the fl it roofs having small stone domes. The main quarter is about 700 yards long, and two smaller groups of houses exist north and south of this. The hill behind is terraced, and luxuriant vineyards surround the place, which is well watered on the north by three principal springs, including the Well Sirah, now 'Ain Sdrah (2 Sam. iii. 26). Three conspicuous minarets rise, two from the Haram the other in the north quarter. The population includes 17,000 Moslems and 600 Jews. The Bedawin bring wool and camel’s hair to the market; and glass bracelets, lamps, and leather water-skins are manufactured in the town. The modern name of Hebron is El Khalil, “the friend,” in allusion to Abraham the friend of God. The most conspicuous building is the Haram, an enclosure measuring 112 feet east and west by 198 north and south, surrounded with high rampart walls of masonry similar in size and dressing to that of the Jerusalem Haram walls. These ramparts are ascribed by architectural authorities to the Herodian period. The interior area is partly occupied by a 12th century Gothic church, and contains six modern cenotaphs of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Sarah, Rebecca, and Leah. The cave beneath the platform has probably not been entered for at least 600 years. The numerous traditional sites now shown round Hebron are traceable generally to mediaeval legendary topography, including the tombs of Adam, Esau, Judah, Abner, and Jesse, the Field of Damascus, the Vale of Tears, and the Oak of Mamre (“plain” in A. V.,Gen. xiii. 18), which has at various times been shown in different positions from ∣ mile to 2 miles from the town.
