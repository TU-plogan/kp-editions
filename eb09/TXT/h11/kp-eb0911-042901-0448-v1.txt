HAMPDEN, Renn Dickson (1793-1868), bishop of Hereford, was born at Barbados, where his father was colonel of the local militia, in 1793, and after receiving a private school education under Dr Rowlandson, vicar of Warminster, Wiltshire, entered as a commoner at Oriel College, Oxford, in 1810. Having taken his B.A. degree with first-class honours in .both the classical and mathematical schools in 1813, he in the following year obtained the chancellor’s prize for a Latin essay “On the Office of the Ephors at Sparta,” and shortly afterwards he was elected to a fellowship in his college, Keble, Newman, and Arnold being among the number of his contemporaries. Having left the university in 1816 he held successively the curacies of Newton, Faringdon, and Hackney, and in 1827 he published An Essay on the Philosophical Evidence of Christianity, followed by a volume of Parochial Sermons illustrative of the importance of the Revelation of Cod in Jesus Christ (1828). In 1828 he returned to Oxford as tutor of Oriel, and after having twice acted as public examiner in classics, he was selected to preach the Bampton lectures in 1832, when he chose for his subject The Scholastic Philosophy considered in its Relation to Christian Theology (1833; 3ded. 1848). Notwithstanding a charge of Arianism now brought against him by the Tractarian party, he in 1833 obtained the principalship of St Mary’s Hall, and in 1834 the chair of moral philosophy; nor did a university statute of censure against him on the ground of the supposed heterodoxy of the Bampton lectures avail to check his promotion to the regius professorship of divinity in 1836. There resulted a widespread and violent though ephemeral controversy, after the subsidence of which he published a Lecture on Tradition, which has passed through several editions, and a volume on The Thirty-nine Articles of the Church of England. His nomination by Lord John Russell to the vacant see of Hereford in December 1847 was again the signal for a violent and organized opposition; and his consecration in March 1848 took place in spite of a remonstrance by many of the bishops and the resistance of Dr Merewether, the dean of Hereford, who went so far as to vote against the election when the conge d'élire reached the cathedral. As bishop of Hereford Dr Hampden made no change in his long-formed habits of studious seclusion, and his episcopate was not characterized in a special degree by any form of churchly [9:11:430] activity or zeal. Among the more important of his later literary performances were the articles on Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates, contributed to the eighth edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and afterwards reprinted with additions under the title of The Fathers of the Greek Philosophy (Edinburgh, 1862). In 1866 he had a paralytic seizure which unfitted him for severe mental exertion, and he died at London on the 23d of April 1868.
