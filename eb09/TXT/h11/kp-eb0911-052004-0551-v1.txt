HATTO I. (c. 850-913), tenth archbishop of Mainz, was born of a Swabian family about the middle of the 9th century. Educated at the monastery of Ellwangen or at Fulda, he attracted the attention ,of the emperor Arnulf, who in 888 made him abbot of Reichenau, in 889 abbot of Ellwangen, and in 891 archbishop of Mainz. During his reign Hatto acquired much ecclesiastical as well as political power. He presided over the council at Tribur or Teuver (895), at which the emperor and twenty-six or twenty-seven bishops attended, and was employed as ambassador to Charles the Simple and the king of Lorraine at their conference at Saint Goar in 899. Twice he accompanied Arnulf to Italy, in 894 and 896. On the death of Arnulf in 900, Hatto became regent and guardian of Louis, and in the contestjvith the dukes of Babenberg treacherously betrayed into the emperor’s hands Count Adalbert, who was one of their partisans. Under Louis’s successor, Conrad I., Hatto retained his influence, but he died in 913, two years after Conrad’s accession. Another but less probable account has it that he was killed at the battle of Heresburg in 912. Hatto was a zealous churchman and a bold and energetic statesman. By his influence the crown and the church combined to check the growing power of the great nobles. In a letter to Pope John IX., still extant, he defends the German bishops from certain charges made to the pope. There is a tradition, due probably to his ambition and violence, that his corpse was seized by the devil and thrown into the crater of Mount Etna. The tradition of the Mouse Tower on the Rhine at Bingen is connected with another Hatto, also archbishop of Mainz (968-970).
