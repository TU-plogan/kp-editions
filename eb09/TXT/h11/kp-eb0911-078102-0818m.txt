HESSIAN FLY, a name originally given in the United States in 1776 during the War of Independence to a small fly very destructive to wheat, supposed to have been brought over in straw by the Hessian troops employed on the British side. It is a species of Cecidomyia, described under the name C. destructor by the American entomologist Say, and belonging to the Dipterous family Cecidomyiida>, the numerous members of which produce galls, distortions, and other injuries in the plants they attack. It was often thought that this insect occurred in England; but the indigenous English wheat-midge, also very destructive, is an allied species, Diplosis tritici. A species found in Hungary and Germany, where it has committed great damage, has been supposed to be the true Hessian fly, which has also been recorded from Minorca and Naples; Cohn notices its ravages in Silesia, and Künstler in Austria; and Kaltenbach (who identifies C. secalina, Loew, with it) says it is more or less common in Germany, and that it originally came from Europe. Nevertheless, many good authorities have considered that the destructive European fly is not identical with the North American insect, though closely allied to it, and of similar habits. In the United States this minute midge has been a dreadful scourge at times, even to the extent of causing local famine. The female lays 20 or 30 eggs in a crease of the leaf of the young plant, and the larvae when hatched work their way between the leaf and the stalk, till they come to a joint, a little below the surface, where they remain, head down, sucking the sap, and turn to pupae enclosed in a covering; this is known as the “flax-seed” condition. The injury occasioned is not detected until the plant grows higher. There are two broods every year, one reaching the fly state in May, the other in August or early in September; as the fly only lives a few weeks, wheat that is sown so late as nut to come up until the second brood has disappeared escapes harm. The usual result of the attack is that small aborted ears only are formed, the few grains of which shrivel and will scarcely ripen, the straw also being of inferior quality. The perfect insect is smaller than the common gnat, which it somewhat resembles, and from which its size and more simple antennae distinguish it. The larvae are spindle-shaped and reddish-white, with the intestinal canal showing through the skin when full grown; they are about one-seventh of an inch long, and are provided with small hooks near the head; at this stage they group themselves in regular rings round the stem attacked. A very minute natural parasite, Semiotellus destructor, belonging to the division Pteromalides of the Hymenopterous family Chalci- didoe is, luckily for agriculturists, usually so plentiful as to be able to keep down the fly, on the larvae and pupae of which its own larvae feed.

Besides the original account by Say (in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Science, Philadelphia, 1817), his countryman, Dr Asa Fitch, has published a history of this insect in the Transactions of the New York State Agricτcltural Society, 1846; and in England the celebrated entomologist Kirby gave an account of it in the Magazine of Natural History, 1829. It is figured in the American Naturalist, vol. ii. p. 163. A map showing its distribution will be found in Hayden’s Report of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey for 1875.
