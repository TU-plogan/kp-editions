HIPPOLYTUS, St, according to the Roman breviary, was one of St Lawrence’s converts, who, when summoned before the emperor Valerian on account of the practice of his religion, made a public profession of Christianity. First beaten with rods, he was finally delivered over along with all his family to death, the mode of execution in his case being similar to that by which Hippolytus the son of Theseus perished. The mythical character of this legend, which, however, can in part be traced as far back as to Prudentius (Hym. 11), is recognized by Döllinger (see his Hippolytus u. Kallistus, chap. ii.). This saint, along with Casianus, is commemorated by the Roman Church on August 13. He is the patron of Mexico.
