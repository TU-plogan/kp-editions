HEINSIUS, Nikolaes, an illegitimate son of the subject of last article, was born in 1655 at the Hague. At the age of twenty he wrote The Delightful Adventures and Wonderful Life of Mirander, a work of extraordinary humour and genius, the sole original romance produced in HollÎ¹nd during the 17th century. Dr Ten Brink has pointed out that Mirander preceded Gil Blas, which it curiously resembles, by at least forty years. The author, however, added nothing else to literature. He was disowned by his father, driven from the house, and in 1677 had to flee the country on account of a murder which he committed at night in the streets of the Hague. He lived a precarious life as an outlaw in Paris, Rome, and elsewhere, and died in obscurity.
