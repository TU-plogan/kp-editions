HÉBERT, Jacques René (1755-1794),a French revolutionist, surnarned from the newspaper he edited “Le Père Duchesne,” was born of obscure parents at Alençon in 1755. He came at an early age to Paris, where he lost more than one situation through malversation, and was in abject poverty when the occurrence of the French Revolution opened up to him a career in which he obtained considerable temporary success and permanent notoriety. Having shown great readiness and proficiency in a style of writing and of oratory which appealed to the worst feelings of the revolutionary mob, he soon acquired great influence in the clubs, and was chosen to oppose the constitutional paper Ls Père Duchesne by editing a revolutionary paper of the same name. The scurrilous and extravagant language of the new print exactly coincided with the sentiments of the class to whom it was addressed, and it contributed not a little to several of the worst and most violent manifestations of the revolutionary spirit. It had a very beneficial influence on the fortunes of its editor, who after the 10th August 1792 was one of the chief members of the revolutionary commune, and on the 2d September was appointed substitute to the procureur syndic. On the 21th May 1793 an order was sent out for his arrest by the more moderate party of the commune on the ground that he was plotting their assassination, but on account of a formidable outbreak of the mob he was set at liberty, and when he appeared again at the commune he was presented with a civic crown. Having been appointed a member of the commission to examine Marie Antoinette, he with unsurpassed moral baseness foully accused her of a crime too scandalous to be mentioned, Along with several of his colleagues he invented the worship of the goddess “Reason,” and subsequently he organized a party of ultra-revolutionists known as the Hébertists or enrages. The faction w ere, however, arrested by the committee of public safety, and on the 24th March 1794 were led forth to execution. Hébert behaved with great Cowardice at his trial, and died amid the jeers and insults of the mob over whose passions he had at one time exercised such sway and to whom he owed his promotion to power.

He was the author of Vitres cassées par le véritable Père Duchesne, 1791; Vie privée de l'abbé Maury, 1790; Petit carême de l'abbé Maury, 1791; Nouvelle lanterne magique, 1792.
