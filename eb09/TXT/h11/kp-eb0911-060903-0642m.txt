HECTOR, son of Priam and Hecuba, the champion of the Trojans and the mainstay of their city. Like Paris and other Trojans, he had an Oriental name, Darius, as well as a Greek one, an interesting fact on which many fanciful theories have been founded. He was married to Andromache, daughter of Eetion, king in the Cilician Thebe. By Homer his character is drawn in most favourable colours as a good son, a loving husband and father, and a trusty friend,—religious without superstition, tenderhearted yet courageous. The one blemish apparent in some parts of the Iliad (see Geddes’s Homeric Problem) is a tendency to presumptuous and boastful confidence. He is an especial favourite of Apollo; and later poets even describe him as son of that god. When Achilles, enraged with Agamemnon, deserted the Greeks, Hector drove them back to their ships, which he almost succeeded in burning. Patroclus, the friend of Achilles, who came to the help of the Greeks, was slain by Hector with the help of Apollo. Then Achilles, to revenge his friend’s death, returned to the war, slew Hector, dragged his body behind his chariot to the camp, and afterwards dragged it round the tomb of Patroclus. Priam, guarded by Hermes, went to Achilles and prevailed on him to give back the dead body, which was buried with great honour (ZZ., xxiv.). Hector was worshipped in the Troad by the Boeotian tribe Gephyraei; and he is, like other heroes, probably an ancient god. It would require an inquiry into the whole Trojan legend to determine the conception involved: it is impossible to do more in this place than refer to Ruckert’s essay in this direction.

Scenes from the life of Hector are favourite subjects in vase paintings. A very ancient pinax from Camirus represents his fight with Menelaus over the dead Euphorbus; and on an amphora, also from Camirus, of not later date than 450 b.c. , he is represented starting for battle, standing beside the quadriga into which his charioteer Cebriones has already mounted. Both vases are now in the British Museum. Though many of the subjects in which he was supposed to appear have now been assigned to other heroes,— for example, the frequently occurring Γarting of Hector and Andromache is by a more searching criticism generally transformed into a scene from the life of Amphiaraus,—yet many undoubted examples remain. We find such scenes as the parting cup given by Hecuba to her son as he departs to the battle, his battle with Achilles in presence of Apollo and Athene, or the dragging of his corpse round the tomb of Patroclus.
