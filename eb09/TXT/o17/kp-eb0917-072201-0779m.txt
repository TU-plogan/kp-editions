O’CONNOR, Feargus Edward (1796-1855), Chartist leader, was born in 1796, and entered parliament as member for the county of Cork in 1832. Though a zealous supporter of repeal, he endeavoured to supplant O’Connell as the leader of the party, an attempt which aroused against him the popular antipathy of the Irish. When, therefore, in 1834 he was unseated on petition, he resolved to go to England,where he established the Northern Star newspaper, and became a vehement advocate of the Chartist movement. In 1847 he was returned for Nottingham, and in 1848 he presided at a Chartist demonstration in London, which caused great alarm. (See Chartism, vol. V. p. 434.) The eccentricity and extravagance which had characterized his opinions from the beginning of his career gradually became more marked until they developed into insanity. He began to conduct himself in a strange and disorderly manner in the House of Commons, and in 1853 he was found to be of unsound mind by a commission of lunacy. He died at London 30th August 1855, and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery.
