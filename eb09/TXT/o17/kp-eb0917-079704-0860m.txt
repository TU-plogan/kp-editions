OPPIUS, Caius, was an intimate friend and confidant of Julius Caesar. He managed the dictatorâ€™s private affairs, and took no public office, but during the time when Caesar was absent from Rome he, together with Balbus, exercised very great influence on public business. According to Suetonius, many authorities considered Oppius to have written the histories of the Spanish, African, and Alexandrian wars which are printed among the works of Caesar. Niebuhr unhesitatingly assigns the African war to Oppius.
