ORDINARY is the legal name for a bishop or other person with original ecclesiastical jurisdiction when exercising the functions of his office. He is so called “quia habet ordinariam jurisdictionem in jure proprio et non per depu-tationem” (Coke upon Littleton, 96 a). The word is also used in a non-ecclesiastical sense. By the Divorce Act, 1857, 20 and 21 Vict. c. 85 sq., the judge appointed by that Act had the title of Judge Ordinary. This title has now, however, become obsolete owing to the incorporation of the Divorce Court with the High Court of Justice by the Judicature Act, 1873. In Scotland the judge before whom a cause depends in the Outer House is called the Lord Ordinary in that cause, and the judge who officiates in the Bill Chamber is called the Lord Ordinary on the Bills. In the United States the ordinary possesses, in the States where such an officer exists, powers vested in him by the constitution and acts of the legislature. In South Carolina he is a judicial officer.
