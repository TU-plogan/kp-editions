OBERAMMERGAU, a small village in the mountain valley of the Ammer, in Upper Bavaria, lies 2760 feet above the sea, and about 45 miles to the south-west of Munich. In 1880 it contained 1349 inhabitants, who were mainly engaged in making toys and in carving crucifixes, images of saints, and rosaries. Many of the houses are adorned with quaint frescos of Biblical subjects. The interest of Oberammergau to the outer world is derived from the Passion Plays which are performed here by the villagers at intervals of ten years (the last in 1880), and are now attended by many thousands of European and American visitors.

The Oberammergau Passion Play, or dramatic representation of the sufferings of Christ, is not a survival of a mediaeval mystery or miracle-play, but took its rise from a vow made by the inhabitants in 1633, with the hope of staying a plague then raging. The original text and arrangements were probably made by the monks of Ettal, a monastery a little higher up the valley; but they were carefully remodelled by the parish priest at the beginning of the present century, when the Oberammergau play obtained exemption from the general suppression of such performances by the Bavarian Government. The music was composed by Rochus Dedler, schoolmaster of the parish in 1814. The performances take place on the Sundays of summer, in a large open-air theatre holding 6000 persons, and each lasts about nine hours, with a short intermission at noon. Each scene from the history of Christ is prefaced by a tableau of typical import from the Old Testament. About 700 actors are required, all belonging to the village. The proceeds of the performances are devoted to the good of the community[9:17:704], after defrayal of the costs and payment of a small remuneration to the actors. The villagers regard the Passion Play as a solemn act of religious worship, and the performances are characterized by the greatest reverence. The principal parts are usually hereditary in certain families, and are assigned with regard to moral character as well as dramatic ability. It is considered a disgrace not to be allowed to take part in the play, and the part of Christ is looked upon as one of the greatest of earthly honours. In the years intervening between the representations the villagers are carefully drilled in dramatic performances by their pastor, and most witnesses agree in rating very highly the results produced by the combined religious fervour and artistic instinct of these Alpine peasants. It is to be feared, however, that the concourse of fashionable visitors who now flock to the performance will gradually have the effect of impairing its genuineness and simplicity.

Edward Devrient (in 1850) was among the first to direct general attention to Oberammergau; and numerous German monographs have since appeared on the same subject. A short notice of the play is also given by Hase, Das Geistliche Schauspiel (Engl. tr. by A. W. Jackson, 1880). English accounts of the performances have been given by Blackburn (new ed., 1880), MacColl (reprinted from the Times, 1880), Molloy (1880), Oxenham (1880), and others. An English version of the text of the Passion Play has been published by E. Chιlde (1880). Articles on the subject have also appeared in the following magazines :— Century, 1883; Blackwood’s, vol. cvii.; Contemporary, vol. xyiii.; Macmillan’s, vol. ii.; Harper’s, vols, xlii. and xliii.; Once a Week, vol. xxiii.
