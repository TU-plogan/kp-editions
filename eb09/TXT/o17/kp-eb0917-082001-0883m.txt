ORDER, or Ordination (Ordo seu sacra ordinatio), one of the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church (see Sacrament), is the rite by which the ministers of that church, in their respective ranks as priests, deacons, subdeacons, acolytes, exorcists, lectors, and doorkeepers (ostiarii), receive power and grace for the discharge of their several functions. The nature of these functions is stated in separate articles (see Acolyte, &c.). The sacrament of order or ordination cannot be administered except by a bishop. The seven ranks just mentioned are themselves called “orders,” the first three being distinguished as the [9:17:821] “major” or “holy” orders (ordines majores, sacrae); the others are “minor” (ordines minores). Within the order of the priesthood itself there are various degrees of power and dignity :—(1) that of priest, pure and simple; (2) that of bishop; (3) that of archbishop; (4) that of patriarch (see Bishop, <fcc.). For a brief statement of the points of difference as to ecclesiastical orders between the Roman Catholic and the Orthodox Greek Churches, see vol. xi. p. 159. The Church of England expressly recognizes the diaconate and the priesthood, but no others, as distinct orders; bishops and archbishops are “ordained and consecrated.” In the 25th Article the name of sacrament is deliberately withheld from orders. Compare the articles Clergy, Episcopacy, Independents, Monachism, Presbyterianism.
