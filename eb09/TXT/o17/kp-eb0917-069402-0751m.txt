OAKLAND, a city of the United States, in Alameda county, California, lies opposite San Francisco, of which it is practically a residential suburb, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay, at the terminus of the Central Pacific Railroad. Its beautiful situation, its shady streets, and the excellent quality of its buildings make it a distinctly attractive place. A branch of the bay, dividing the city into East and West Oakland, forms a good harbour, but is obstructed by a bar. The railway pier, 2 miles long, contains a number of warehouses and is traversed by a broad carriage road. Among the local industrial establishments are flour-mills, planing-mills, potteries, tanneries, and a jute-factory turning out 5,000,000 sacks per annum. Oakland, deriving its name from a grove of oaks in the midst of which it was built, was incorporated as a city in 1854. Its population was 1549 in 1860, 10,500 in 1870, and 34,555 in 1880.
