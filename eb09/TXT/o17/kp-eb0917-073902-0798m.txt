OIL CITY, a city of the United States, in Venango county, Pennsylvania, at the junction of Oil Creek with the Allegheny river, lies 132 miles north-north-east of Pittsburg by the Allegheny Valley Railroad, in the heart of the Venango petroleum district, and possesses the principal oil exchange of the world, the transactions in 1883 amounting to 1,129,199,500 barrels, valued at $1,209,654,064. The business part of the city is on the low ground north of the river, the residences occupying the south side and the high bluffs on the north side. Besides manufactories connected with the oil industry, the city has machine-shops, foundries, flour-mills, and breweries. Founded in 1860, and partially destroyed by flood in 1865 and by flood and fire in 1866, Oil City was incorporated as a city in 1871. Its population was 7315 in 1880, and now (1884) is estimated at 10,000.
