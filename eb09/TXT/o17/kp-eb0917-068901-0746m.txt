O The history of the symbol O is parallel to that of E. Each represents several sounds which are distinguished habitually in speech without any difficulty, but for which, owing to the imperfection of the English alphabet, there are no separate symbols. Probably the confusion is worst in English; but French and Italian also have more sounds for each of these symbols than can be properly included under them, and so they distinguish these sometimes by diacritical marks, as ô or ô, and sometimes they do not distinguish at all.

The different sounds which O is used to denote in English lie, with one exception, on the line between the pure a- sound and the pure u- sound. We have already seen that e denotes several different sounds on the other line—that between pure α and pure i. The difference between the sounds on these two lines is this. In the a—i line only the tongue is employed; it is raised more and more for each successive sound. But in the a—u line the tongue is not the only agent; the cavity of the mouth is also contracted, so that the passage is narrowed, and the lip-aperture is lessened more and more for each sound; in technical phrase the lips are “rounded,” so that for u the aperture is the smallest possible to allow of the utterance of a true vowel, hence the great ease with which the Ή-sound passes into a w, in which there is friction caused by the still greater closing of the lips, and therefore we have a consonant not a vowel sound.

The following different sounds—denoted by 0 in English—are readily discriminated. Beginning from the «-end of the line, we come first to the sounds heard in “not” and in “lord”; for both of these the back of the tongue is much depressed and the lips are only slightly rounded. The difference between the two sounds consists in this—for the first the back of the tongue is more convex than for the second; the passage is therefore somewhat narrowed, and the two corresponding sounds are therefore (here and in all the other similar pairs) known technically as “narrow’’and “wide,” or as “open’’and “close.” The narrow sound is written by o in English when r or I follows, and the wide is written aw as in “law,” or au as in “Paul,” or even a as in “pall.” The next pair may be exemplified by “pole” and “pour,” narrow and wide respectively; for these the tongue is higher and the rounding greater. Here again several digraphs represent the same sound, as in “foal,” “soul,” “hoe,” “grow.” Next the doubled o is generally used to represent the last sound in the scale, the close u, for which the tongue is highest and the “rounding” greatest, as in “pool”; but in “rule” and others the same symbol is used for this sound as would be used in other Europeah languages. Lastly—the exception mentioned above— o is one of the symbols employed to denote the neutral vowel, as in “son,” as well as u in “sun” and a in “final.”

The modified German o— written ö or oe— is a sound unknown in English. It is produced by putting the tongue into the position for the sound denoted by a in “fate” or e in “fête ”—a middle sound in the line between a and i— and then by rounding the lips. It thus combines the specialities of the two scales of vowelsound— the i- scale and the ή -scale.

In Italian there are an “open” o (marked o) and a “close” o (marked o). The “open” o corresponds to the open or wide sound described above. The “close ”o is not quite the same as the “narrow” o of English, but comes a little nearer to u.

In the form of the symbol there is no recorded variation, except that in old Latin it was sometimes square, as O. In Greek two symbols were employed—O and Ω—for short and long o respectively. But it is not improbable that the second of these denoted at first not merely long o but a more open sound, more near to the sound of “law” in English.
