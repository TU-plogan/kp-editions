ORFILA, Mathieu Joseph Bonaventure (1787-1853), the founder of modern toxicology, and one of the most eminent of the French school of medicine during its brightest period, was by birth a Spaniard, having been born at Mahon in Minorca on 24th April 1787. An island merchant’s son looked naturally first to the sea for a profession; but a voyage at the age of fifteen to Sardinia, Sicily, and Egypt did not prove satisfactory. He next took to medicine, which he studied at the universities of Valencia and Barcelona with so great applause that the local authorities of the latter city granted him a pension to enable him to follow his studies at Madrid and Paris, preparatory to appointing him professor. He had scarcely settled for that purpose in Paris when the outbreak of the Spanish war, in 1807, threatened destruction to his prospects. But he had the good fortune to find a parent in a merchant uncle at Marseilles, and a patron in the good and great Vauquelin the chemist, who braved the wrath of Napoleon against the Spaniards, claimed him as his pupil, guaranteed his conduct, and saved him from expulsion from Paris. Four years afterwards he graduated, and immediately became a private lecturer on chemistry in the French capital. In 1819 he was appointed professor of medical jurisprudence, and four years later he succeeded Vauquelin as professor of chemistry in the faculty of medicine at Paris. In 1830 he was nominated dean of that faculty, a high medical honour in France. Under the Orleans dynasty, honours were lavishly showered upon him: he became successively member of the council of education of France, member of the general council of the department of the Seine, and commander of the Legion of Honour. The republic of 1848 put an end to these adventitious distinctions; and chagrin at the treatment he experienced at the hands of the Governments which succeeded that of Louis Philippe is supposed to have shortened his life. He died, after a short illness, in March 1853.

Orfila’s chief publications are four in number :— On General Toxi cology (1814), On Medical Jurisprudence (1823), A Treatise on Chemistry (1817), and Medico - legal Exhumations (1836); but he also wrote many valuable papers, chiefly on subjects connected with medical jurisprudence. His fame wül rest mainly on the first-named (Traité de Toxicologie Générale'), published when he was only in his twenty-seventh year. It is a vast mine of experimental observation on the symptoms of poisoning of all kinds, on the appearances which poisons leave in the dead body, on their physiological action, and on the means of detecting them. Few branches of science, so important in their bearings on every-day life and so difficult of investigation, can be said to have been created and raised at once to a state of high advancement by the labours of a single man.
