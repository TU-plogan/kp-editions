OBELISK. See Alexandria, vol. i. p. 495; Architecture, vol. ii. p. 390; and Egypt, vol. vii. pp. 768, 778. The obelisk known as “Cleopatra’s Needle,” referred to in vol. i. p. 495 as having been offered to the English Government by Mehemet Ali, but declined, has since been brought to London, and placed on the Thames Embankment in 1878. The other was conveyed to the United States and erected in Central Park, New York, in 1880.
