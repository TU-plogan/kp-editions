OLDHAM, John (1653-1683), a satirist of the Restoration period, achieved notoriety by his Satires on the Jesuits, published during the heat of the excitement caused by the revelations of Titus Oates and the murder of Godfrey in 1678. In such a time of national panic and hatred “who peppered the highest was surest to please,” and Oldham’s satires could hardly be surpassed for energy of invective and copiousness of coarse extravagant irony. They were extravagant enough to pass in a more sober age for burlesques of anti-Popish frenzy. Oldham was at the time a tutor in a judge’s family. He was the son of a Nonconformist minister, born at Shipton, near Tedbury in Gloucestershire, in 1653, was a B.A. of Oxford (Edmund Hall), and had been for some three years an usher in a school at Croydon. Before he appeared as a satirist, and while he was still an usher, his verses, circulated in MS., had attracted the attention of Will’s Coffee-house, and Rochester with some of his boon companions had sallied down to Croydon to see what the new poet was like. It was probably an extravagantly humorous dithyrambic drunkard’s soliloquy that roused their curiosity, and when they found him a tall, thin, consumptive, harsh-featured cynic they apparently left him to his drudgery. After the success of his Satires on the Jesuits, Oldham wrote more satires, imitations of Horace and Juvenal, and one of them, a satire on poets, setting forth bitterly their degradation, their poverty, their humiliating adulation of patrons, is often quoted as an index to the condition of men of letters in those days. He died prematurely ( 1683) at the age of thirty, and was eloquently lamented by Dryden as the “Marcellus of our tongue.”

‘ ‘ Farewell, too little and too lately known, Whom I began to think and call my own; For sure our souls were near allied, and thine Cast in the same poetic mould as mine.”

Oldham’s verse was rugged, and his rage, as Pope said, “too like Billingsgate”; but “maturing time,” as Dryden hoped, might have softened these faults. Donne and Cowley were his literary models, and he poured into their forms great warmth of feeling, wealth of incident, and commanding force of language.
