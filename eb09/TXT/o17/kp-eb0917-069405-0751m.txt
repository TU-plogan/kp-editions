OAR-FISH, a fish of the family of ribbon-fishes {Tradιypterid∂c), to which great interest is attached no less on account of the extraordinary shape of its body than of its internal organization, which is unmistakably that of a deep-sea fish. As in the other members of this family, the body is much elongated and compressed, sword-shaped; [9:17:695] but in the oar-fish this character is excessive, the length of the body being about fifteen times its depth. The head likewise is compressed, short, resembling in its form that of a herring; the eye is large; the mouth is small, and provided with very feeble teeth. A long many-rayed dorsal fin, of which the very long anterior rays form a kind of high crest, extends from the top of the head to the end of the tail; the anal and perhaps the caudal fins are absent; but the ven trais (and by this the oar-fish is distinguished from the other ribbon-fishes) are developed into a pair of long filaments, which terminate in a paddle-shaped extremity, but are too flexible to assist in locomotion. The whole body is covered with a layer of silvery epidermoid substance, which easily comes off and adheres to other objects.

Oar-fishes are the largest deep-sea fishes known, the majority of the specimens observed measuring 12 feet in length; but some are recorded to have exceeded 20 feet. Their range in the great depths of the ocean seems to extend over all seas, from the North Sea to the South Atlantic, from Mauritius and Japan to the coasts of New Zealand. But, however numerous they may be in the depths which are their home, it is only by rare accident that specimens reach the surface; and of these a very small proportion only have come under the observation of naturalists, and been actually recorded. Thus from the coasts of Great Britain only about twenty captures are known in the long space of a century and a half, and not more than thirteen from those of Norway. Oar-fishes have been considered by naturalists to have given rise to some of the tales of “sea-serpents,” but their size as well as the facility with which they are secured when observed render this solution of the question of the existence of such a creature improbable. When they rise to the surface of the water they are either dead or in a helpless and dying condition. The ligaments and tissues by which the bones and muscles were held together whilst the fish lived under the immense pressure of great depths have then become loosened and torn by the expansion of the internal gases; and it is only with difficulty that the specimens can be taken entire out of the water, and preserved afterwards. Every specimen found has been more or less mutilated; and especially the terminal portion of the tail, which seems to end in a delicate tapering filament, has never been perfect;—it is perhaps usually lost as a useless appendage at a much earlier period of the life of the fish.
