OIL-CAKE. The solid compressed mass remaining after the expression of oil from the many oil-yielding seeds, nuts, &c., forms a material of considerable commercial importance. It retains after the most perfect treatment by pressure no inconsiderable portion of oil, with practically the whole of the albuminous matter, sugar, mucilage, and the starchy components of the seeds, <fcc., thus forming in most cases a concentrated nutritious food for cattle and sheep, specially valuable for fattening store animals for the market. The only commercial cakes which are unfit for animal food are such as contain purgative or other active principles, as, for example, the cakes of castor-oil seed, croton seed, purgingnut seed, and mustard seed. The most valuable and at the same time the most abundantly produced feeding-cake is that obtained from ordinary Linseed (q.v.). Next in value is the cake yielded by rape seed, but its wholesomeness is frequently marred by the presence of a large proportion of acrid mustard seed; the best is that yielded by the German green rape seed (Brassica rapa oleifera). Cotton-seed cake is also a feeding stuff of considerable importance. It is prepared in two forms, either as decorticated cake, in which the husks of the cotton seed are removed previous to the expression of the oil, or as undecorticated cake, which may contain as much as 40 to 50 per cent, of indigestible woody husk. Among other cakes useful for feeding purposes may be enumerated ground-nut cake from Arachis hypogaea, palm-kernel cake from the seeds of the oil palm, sesame or til cake from the seed of Sesamum, orientale, and hemp cake from the seed of Cannabis sativa. The following table indicates the average composition of a few of the principal commercial cakes.

Oil-cake should be thoroughly dried by exposure before being packed or stored, otherwise it is apt to heat, and turn sour and mouldy, in which condition it becomes injurious to cattle. The cake also made from rancid seed is frequently deleterious, and so disagreeable in taste as to be refused by animals. Oil-cakes of high value are subject to adulteration; and compounds of varying composition are prepared and sold under commercial brands simply as feeding cake or mixed cake with no indication of their component materials. These are usually largely intermixed with bran, husks, ground rice, and maize siftings, &c.
