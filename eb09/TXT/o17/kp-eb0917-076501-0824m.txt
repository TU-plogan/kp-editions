OLORON-SAINTE-MARIE, the chief town of an arrondissement in the department of Basses-Pyrénées, France, lies about 21 miles south-west of Pau, at the confluence of the mountain torrents (locally known as “gaves”) Aspe and Ossau, which unite to form the Oloron, a tributary of the Pau. The united population of Oloron and of Sainte-Marie, on the opposite bank of the Aspe, is 7746. Oloron, curiously clustered on the summit and slopes of a steep hill, has remains of old ramparts and pleasant promenades with beautiful views. The only building of interest, the church of the Sainte-Croix, belongs mainly to the 11th century; it contains a large altar of gilded wood, constructed in the Spanish style of the 17th century. The church of Sainte-Marie, which formerly served as the cathedral of Oloron, is a medley of various styles from the 11th to the 15th century, and its sculptures are more antique than tasteful. The fairs and markets of Oloron for cattle, horses, wool, and hams are much frequented. It manufactures woollen goods, textile fabrics, and caps (bérets), and has also tanyards and flour-mills.

Oloron, formerly Iluro, an ancient episcopal town, was destroyed by the Saracens, and afterwards by the Normans, and was rebuilt in 1080 by the viscount of Béarn. At the Reformation the place became a centre of Catholic reaction. In the 17th century ιt carried on a considerable trade with Aragon, until the Spaniards, jealous of its prosperity, pillaged the establishments of the Oloron merchants at Saragossa in 1694,—a disaster from which it only slowly recovered. The bishopric was suppressed in 1790.
