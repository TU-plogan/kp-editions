OBERLIN, Jean Frédéric (1740-1826), pastor and philanthropist, was the son of a teacher, and was born 31st August 1740 at Strasburg, where he studied theology. In 1766 he became Protestant pastor of Waldbach, a remote and poverty-stricken region in the Steinthal (Ban de la Roche) in Alsace. At once he set himself to better the material equally with the spiritual condition of the inhabitants. He began by constructing roads through the valley and erecting bridges, inciting the peasantry to the enterprise by himself taking a mattock and commencing operations. His example proved equally effectual in introducing an improved system of agriculture, with the result that the sterile Waldbach soon “began to blossom as the rose.” Substantial cottages were erected, various industrial arts were introduced, and activity and comfort began to prevail in homes formerly tenanted by listless and ignoble poverty. Regarding the intellectual needs of his parishioners Oberlin was also keenly solicitous. He founded an itinerant library, originated infant schools—the first that have existed—and established an ordinary school at each of the five villages in the parish. In the work of education he received great assistance from Louise Scheppler, who lived in his house in the capacity of servant and housekeeper. By his unselfish devotion to their interests Oberlin won so entirely the confidence of his parishioners that he was consulted in the most minute domestic affairs, and his word became the recognized unwritten law of the district. He died 1st June 1826, and was interred with great manifestations of honour and affection at the village of Fouday. Since his death the Steinthal has suffered no interruption to its prosperity. When he began his labours its inhabitants did not number more than 500; in the beginning of the century they had increased to about 3000; and now they are supposed to number about 6000.

Among the numerous narratives of the labours of Oberlin mention may be made of Sims, Brief Memorials of Oberlin, London, 1830; Memoirs of Oberlin, with a short notice of L<misa Scheppler, London, 1838, 2d ed. 1852; H. Ware, Biography of Oberlin, Boston, 1845; Spach, Oberlin le pasteur, Strasburg, 1865, 2d ed. 1868; Biff, Drei Bilder aus dem Leben von Papa Oberlin, Strasburg, 1880; and Butler, Life of J. F. Oberlin, 1882. The collected writings of Oberlin were published by Burkhardt at Stuttgart in 1843, in 4 vols.
