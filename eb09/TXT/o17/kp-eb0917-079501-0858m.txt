OPODELDOC, a name now applied to a liniment composed of soap, camphor, the volatile oils of rosemary and origanum, solution of ammonia, and spirit of wine. It is made of such a consistence that it is solid at ordinary temperatures, but melts with the warmth of the hand. The origin of the name is lost in obscurity, but is believed to have been first applied to a plaster, invented by Mindererus or Paracelsus, and used for bruises and external injuries. In the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia (1721) opodeldoc was official under the name of unguentum opodeldoch, and then consisted of thirteen aromatic ingredients besides Venice soap, camphor, and spirit of wine. Its first appearance in the London Pharmacopoeia seems to have been in 1746 under the name of linimentum saponaceum. In the British Pharmacopoeia of 1867 it is represented by the liniment of soap, which differs from the earlier preparations in being fluid at ordinary temperatures.
