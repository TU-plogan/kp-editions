OGLETHORPE, James Edward (1696-1785), general, the founder of the State of Georgia, was born in London 21st December 1696, the son of Sir Theophilus Oglethorpe of Godaiming, Surrey. He entered Corpus Christi College, Oxford, in 1714, but in the same year joined the army of Prince Eugène. Through the recommendation of the duke of Marlborough he became aide-de-camp to the prince, and he served with distinction in the campaign against the Turks, 1716-17, more especially at the siege and capture of Belgrade. After his return to England he was in 1722 chosen member of parliament for Hazlemere. He devoted much attention to the improvement of the circumstances of poor debtors in London prisons; and for the purpose of providing an asylum for persons who had become insolvent, and for oppressed Protestants on the Continent, he projected the settlement of a colony in America between Carolina and Florida. A full account of the enterprise and the subsequent relation of Oglethorpe to the colony will be found in the article Georgia, vol. x. p. 437. In 1745 Oglethorpe was promoted to the rank of major-general. His conduct in connexion with the Scottish rebellion of that year was the subject of inquiry by court-martial, but he was acquitted. In 1765 he was raised to the rank of general. He died at Cranham Hall, Essex, 1st July 1785.

0G0WAY, or Ogowe (0gooauai, O gobai), a river of West Africa which falls into the Atlantic in the neighbourhood of 1° S. lat., or 400 miles north of the mouth of the Congo. The extent of its delta (70 to 80 miles from north to south), and the immense volume of water which it brings down when in flood, gave origin to the belief that it must either be a bifurcation of the Congo or one of the leading arteries of the continent. The former view was set aside by the fact that the two rivers did not rise at the same season of the year; but so recently as 1876 Czerny advocated the identity of the Ogoway with Schweinfurth’s famous Uelle (Welle), with Nachtigal’s Bahr-Kuta, and with Barth’s river of Kubanda, thus taking it right across to the neighbourhood of the Nile basin. It appears, however, that the head-streams of the Ogoway rise in the hilly country about 200 or 300 miles from the coast of the Atlantic (though the actual course of the river is 500 to 600 miles), and its extraordinary volume is to be explained by their draining an extensive tract on both sides of the equator which is deluged with tropical rains. Savorgnan de Brazza claims to have reached (1882) the sources of the river in a rugged, sandy, and almost treeless plateau, which forms the watershed between its basin and that of the Congo, whose main stream is only 140 miles distant. Cutting its way athwart the gneiss and schists of the various ranges of the Sierra Complida, the main stream of the Ogoway (often called the Okanda from one of the tribes on its banks) is interrupted with cataracts and rapids (at Fare, 26 feet, and Dume, for example) till within a comparatively short distance from the confluence with its principal left-hand affluent, the Ngunie, in 0° 35' S. lat. and 10° 25' E. long. Even in the upper part of its course, however, it often attains a great width, and below this confluence it spreads out into an average of 8000 feet, at the same time showing a tendency to split into a number of secondary channels, some of which connect it on the north with the great Ajingo Lake, and on the south with the still larger Jonanga Lake. The northmost branch of the delta—the Nazareth river, which falls into Nazareth" Bay to the north of Cape Lopez—has in the driest period of the year a depth of from 20 to 30 feet, and its water is drinkable even at flood-tide. The southern arms discharge into the extensive Cama or Nkomi Lagoon and the Rio Fernäo Vaz. With the exception of the Ngunie, which has been ascended 40 miles as far as the Samba falls, the affluents of the Ogoway—the Passa, Lolo, Shebe, Ivindo, Ofue, <fcc.—are but very partially known; and some of those from the north may prove to have a longer course than is at present supposed. The Ogoway rises in March and April, and again in October and November; it is navigable for steamers in its low-water condition as far as the junction of the Ngunie.

Though Bowditch called attention in 1817 to the existence of the river, it was not till 1857-59 that its exploration was begun by Du Chaillu. It has since been made known by the labours of Serval and Griffon du Ballay, R. B. N. Walker, Aymés, the marquis de Compiègne, A. Marche, Oskar Lenz, and Savorgnan de Brazza. English and German factories were founded about 1868 at Adelina Longa (Adaûlinaûlonga), and at Franceville, a station of the International African Association, in 1880.
