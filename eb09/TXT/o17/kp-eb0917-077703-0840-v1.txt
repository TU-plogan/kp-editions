OPAL, a natural form of hydrated silica, occurring in a “porodine” condition, i.e., it has apparently hardened from a gelatinous state. During consolidation it has suffered contraction unequally in different directions; and thus, though amorphous, it behaves in polarized light like a doubly-refracting body.

The beautiful variety known as noble or precious opal is remarkable for its play of iridescent colours. In the “harlequin opal” these rainbow-tints are flashed forth from small flakes, forming a kind of polychromatic mosaic, while in other kinds of opal the colours are disposed in broad bands or in irregular patches of comparatively large area. The tints vary with the angle at which the light is incident, and with the relative position of the stone and the observer, so that by moving the opal a brilliant succession of flashes of fire may be obtained. Careful examination of a precious opal shows that these flashes are reflected from surfaces of irregular dimensions, situated at different depths in the translucent stone, and intersecting at various angles. The colours are not due to the presence of any material pigment in the mineral, but are optical effects due to certain structural peculiarities.

According to Sir David Brewster the colours of the opal may be referred to the presence of multitudes of microscopic pores arranged in parallel lines, the differences of tint arising from differences in the magnitude of these cavities. Μ. Descloizeaux, a very high authority on the optical properties of minerals, has also connected the iridescence of the opal with a regular system of internal cavities, but at the same time seems disposed to think that the colours bear some relation to the presence of a small quantity of organic matter in the mineral. Mr Crookes refers the colours to delicate striae or minute fissures lying in different planes within the opal. The whole subject has been exhaustively studied by H. Behrens, who explains the colour as due not to reflexion from the walls of cavities but to the interposition of very thin lamellae possessing a different index of refraction from that of the matrix in which they are embedded. He has detected in the opal a variety of microscopic enclosures, including flecks of hydrophane and delicate laminae of ferric oxide. On the whole, therefore, it seems likely that the iridescence of the opal is simply a case of the well-known colours of thin plates. A ray of light is reflected from the anterior surface of an attenuated film; another ray, having traversed the lamina, is reflected from the posterior surface; and the meeting of these rays differing in phase gives rise to interference phenomena.

The noble opal, in consequence of its brilliant iridescence, is valued as an ornamental stone. It is displayed to best advantage when cut en cabochon or with a convex surface. Pliny relates that the rich Roman senator Nonius was proscribed by Mark Antony for the sake of a magnificent opalus which he possessed, a stone as large as a hazel nut, and valued at 20,000 sesterces.

The precious opal occurs in veins in trachytic rocks, chiefly in Hungary. The best-known localities are Czerwenitza and Kaschau, but the most brilliantly - coloured stones are said to come from Kremnitz and Dubnik. It is found also in Honduras, principally near Gracias a Dios, where it occurs in like manner, forming veins in volcanic rocks. The American opal is generally less milky and less fiery than the Hungarian. Of late years some very brilliant opal has been sent into the market from Queensland. This is found as thin films spread over the walls of fissures in ironstone nodules, occurring in the neighbourhood of the Baracorra river. It is generally too thin to be cut en cabochon, but is largely used for camei, the iridescent layers showing to great advantage against the ironstone matrix, which when polished assumes a dark-brown colour. The so-called “black opals,” which have lately become popular, consist of this matrix penetrated in all directions by veins and spots of opal, forming a mixture sometimes known as “root of opal.” Certain stones sold as black opals have evidently been modified in colour by staining or by heat.
