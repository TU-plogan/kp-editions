OLYBRIUS, Roman emperor from 11th July to 23d October 472, was a member of the Anician family and a native of Rome, where he lived until the sack of Genseric in 455. He then went to Constantinople, where in 464 he was made consul, and about the same time married Placidia, daughter of Valentinian III. In 472 he was sent to Italy by the emperor Zeno to assist Anthemius against Ricimer, but, having entered into negotiations with the latter, was himself proclaimed emperor, and, on the murder of his rival, ascended the throne unopposed. His reign was as uneventful as it was brief. He died from natural causes.
