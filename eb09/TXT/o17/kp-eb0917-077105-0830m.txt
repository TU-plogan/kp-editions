‘OMAR KHAYYÁM. The great Persian mathematician, astronomer, freethinker, and epigrammatist, Ghiyâth-uddin Abulfath Omar bin Ibrâhîm al-Khayyâmi, who derived the epithet Khayyâm (the tentmaker) most likely from his father’s trade, was born in or close by Nishâpùr, and is stated to have died there in 517 a.h. (1123 a.d.). This date is accepted by most Eastern and Western writers, but the renowned vizier of the Seljùk sultâns Alp Arslan and Malikshâh, Nizâm-ulmulk of Tùs, whose birth is fixed in 408 A.H. (1017 a.d.), expressly states in one of his writings that Omar was of the same age as himself, and attended with him the lectures of the imâm Muwaffak: in the college of Nishâpùr. However that may be, there cannot be the slightest doubt that at an early age Omar entered into a close friendship both with Nizâm-ulmulk and his schoolfellow Hasan ibn Sabbâh, who founded afterwards the terrible sect of the Isma'flis or Assassins. The three friends pledged themselves by a solemn promise that he who should first gain an influential position in the world would lend a helping hand to the other two and promote their success in life. When Nizâm-ulmulk was raised to the rank of vizier by Alp Arslan (1063-1073 a.d.) he remembered this covenant and bestowed upon Hasan ibn Sabbâh the dignity of a chamberlain, whilst offering a similar court office to Omar Khayyâm. But the latter contented himself with an annual stipend which would enable him to devote all his time to his favourite studies of mathematics and astronomy, and he soon proved his gratitude for the liberality of his patron and friend by the publication of his standard work on algebra, written in Arabic. This and other treatises of a similar character— for instance, on the extraction of cube roots and on the explanation of difficult definitions in Euclid—raised him at once to the foremost rank among the mathematicians of that age, and induced Sultân Malikshâh to summon him in 467 A.H. (1074 a.d.) to institute astronomical observations on a larger scale, and to aid him in his great enterprise of a thorough reform of the calendar. A twofold fruit resulted from Omar’s elaborate research in the sultan’s observatory,—a revised edition of the Zfj or astronomical tables, and the introduction of the Ta’rfkh-i-Malikshâhf or Jalâli, that is, the so-called Jalâlian or Seljùk era, which commences in 471 a.h. (1079 a.d., 15th March).

Great, however, as Omar’s scientific fame has always been throughout the East, it is nearly eclipsed by his still greater poetical renown, which he owes to his rubais or quatrains, a collection of about 500 epigrams, unequalled by any of his predecessors or followers. The peculiar form of the rubâ'f—viz., four lines, the first, second, and fourth of which have the same rhyme, while the third usually (but not always) remains rhymeless—was first successfully introduced into Persian literature as the exclusive vehicle for subtle thoughts on the various topics of Sùfic mysticism by the sheikh Abù Sa'id bin Abulkhair,^[1. Died Jan. 1049. Comp. Ethé’s edition of his ruba'is in Sitzungsberichte der bayr. Akademie, 1875, pp. 145 sq., and 1878, pp. 38 sq. ] but Omar differs in its treatment considerably from Abü Sa'id. Although some of his quatrains are purely mystic and pantheistic, most of them bear quite another stamp; they are the breviary of a radical freethinker, who protests in the most forcible manner both against the narrowness, bigotry, and uncompromising austerity of the orthodox ulemâ and the eccentricity, hypocrisy, and wild ravings of advanced Süfis, whom he successfully combats with their own weapons, using the whole mystic terminology simply to ridicule mysticism itself. There is in this respect a great resemblance between him and Hâfiz, but Omar is decidedly superior, not so much on account of his priority as for his more concise, more simple, and yet infinitely more energetic style. He has often been called the Voltaire of the East, and cried down as materialist and atheist. As far as purity of diction, fine wit, crushing satire against a debased and ignorant clergy, and a general sympathy with suffering humanity are concerned, Omar certainly reminds us of the great Frenchman; but there the comparison ceases. Voltaire never wrote anything equal to [9:17:772] Omar’s fascinating rhapsodies in praise of wine, love, and all earthly joys, to the fervent effusions of his heart so full of the most tender feelings and affections, and his passionate denunciations of a malevolent and inexorable fate which dooms to slow decay or sudden death and to eternal oblivion all that is great, good, and beautiful in this world. There is a touch of Byron, Swinburne, and even of Schopenhauer in many of his rubâ'is, which clearly proves that the modern pessimist is by no means a novel creature in the realm of philosophic thought and poetical imagination.

The Leyden copy of Omar Khayyam’s work on algebra was noticed as far back as 1742 by Gerald Meerman in the preface to his Specimen calculi fluxionalis ; further notices of the same work by Sédillot appeared in the Nouv. Jour. As., 1834, and in vol. xiii. of the Notices et Extraits des MSS. de la Bibl. roy. The complete text, together with a French translation (on the basis of the Leyden and Paris copies, the latter first discovered by Μ. Libri, see his Histoire des sciences mathématiques en Italie, i. 300), was edited by F. Woepcke, L'algèbre d’Omar Alkhayyâmi, Paris, 1851. Articles on Omar’s life and works are found in Reinaud’s Géographie d’Aboulféda, pref., p. 101; Notices et Extraits, ix. 143 sq. ; Garcin de Tassy, Note sur les Eubâ'iyât de Omar Khaïyàm, Paris, 1857; and Rieu, Cat. Pers. MSS. in the Er. Mus., ii. p. 546. The quatrains have been edited at Calcutta, 1836, and Teheran, 1857 and 1862; text and French translation by J. B. Nicolas, Paris, 1867 (very incorrect and misleading); a portion of the same, rendered in English verse, by E. Fitzgerald, London, 1859, 1872, and 1879. A new English version was published in Triibner’s “Oriental Series,” 1882, by E. H. Whinfield, and the first critical edition of the text, with translation, by the same, 1883. (H. E.)
