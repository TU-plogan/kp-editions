ÖLAND, or Oeland, next to Gottland, the largest of the islands belonging to Sweden, stretches for 85 miles along the east coast of the southern extremity of that country, from which it is separated by the Calmar Sound, about 5 miles broad at the narrowest point, and not more than 10 fathoms deep in the central portion. Its greatest breadth does not exceed 8 or 9 miles, and its area is estimated at 510 square miles. Consisting for the most part of Silurian limestone, and thus forming a striking contrast to the mainland with its granite and gneiss, Öland is further remarkable on account of the peculiarities of its structure. Down the west side for a considerable distance runs a limestone ridge, rising usually in terraces, but at times in steep cliffs, to an extreme height of 200 feet; and along the east side there is a parallel ridge of sand (resting on limestone), never exceeding 90 feet. These ridges, known as the Western and Eastern Landtborgar, are connected towards the north and the south by belts of sand and heath; and the hollow between them is occupied by a desolate and almost barren tract: the southern portion or Allvar (forming fully half of the southern part of the island) presents a surface of bare red limestone scored by superficial cracks and unfathomed fissures, and calcined by the heat refracted from the surrounding heights; and the northern portion is covered at best with a copse of hazel bushes. Outside the ridges, however, Öland has quite a different aspect,— the hillsides being not unfrequently adorned with clumps of trees, and the narrow strip of alluvial coast-land with its cornfields and villages and church towers presenting an appearance of fruitfulness and prosperity. There are only a few small streams in the island; and only one lake, Hornsjö, about 3 miles long, deserves to be mentioned. Of the fir woods which once clothed a considerable area in the north the Böda crown-park is the only remnant. Grain, sandstone, and alum are exported from the island,— the alum mines at South (Södra) Mockleby being in fact the most extensive in Sweden, and furnishing 7000 tons per annum. The only town is Borgholm, on the west coast, with one of the finest castle-ruins in Sweden. The town was founded only in 1817, and has not more than 800 or 900 inhabitants; but the castle, dating at least from the 13th century, was long one of the strongest fortresses and afterwards one of the most stately palaces in the country. The island, which bears the title of a countship, was joined in 1824 to the province of Calmar. Its inhabitants, formerly styled Öningar, and showing considerable diversity of origin in the matter of speech, local customs, and physical appearance, numbered 22,820 in 1805, 37,270 in 1865, and 37,975 in 1874.

From the raid of Ragnar Lodbrok’s sons in 775 Öland is frequently mentioned in Scandinavian history, and especially as a battleground in the wars between Denmark and the northern kingdoms. In the Middle Ages it formed a separate legislative and administrative unity.
