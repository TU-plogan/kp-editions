OGYGES, in the legends of Attica and Boeotia, was an early king in whose reign a great flood had overwhelmed the land. A similar legend was current in Phrygia, where the flood was said to have taken place in the reign of Nannacus. No facts are known connecting Ogyges with any religious cultus in Greece, and it is highly probable that the tale was of Oriental origin, introduced into this district of Greece by foreign colonists or traders. The Gephyraei, who emigrated from Boeotia into Attica, and who are said by Herodotus to have been of Phoenician origin, may have brought the story of the flood with them, Î¹ [9:17:734] In the peribolos of Zeus on the banks of the Ilyssus at Athens a hole was shown through which the waters of the flood had run off, and where religious rites were regularly performed, but this hole was associated rather with Deucalion than with Ogyges.
