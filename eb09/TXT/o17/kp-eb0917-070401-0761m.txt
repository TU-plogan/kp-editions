OBERHAUSEN, a Prussian town of recent origin, in the province of the Rhine, is situated 5 miles from the east bank of that river and 20 miles to the north of DÃ¼sseldorf. Its importance is due to the fact of its being one of the busiest railway junctions in Germany, and to the extensive coal-pits in the vicinity. The town also possesses iron-works, rolling-mills, zinc smelting-works, railway workshops, and manufactures of wire-rope, glass, porcelain, and soap. The annual export of coals is estimated at about 700,000 tons. The first houses of Oberhausen were built in 1845, and it received its municipal charter in 1875. In 1880 it contained 16,680 inhabitants, of whom 12,079 were Roman Catholics.
