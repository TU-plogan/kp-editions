CUYABÁ, or Cuiabá, the capital of the Brazilian inland province of Matto Grosso, in 15° 20' S. lat. and 56° W. long., or almost in the heart of the South American continent. It lies about a mile from the left bank of the Cuyabá river, one of the head streams of the Paraguay, at 250 miles by river from the confluence with the main stream, and about 2400 miles from the estuary of the Plata. Its churches, public buildings, and dwelling-houses are generally well-built of brick or of adobe, or of blocks of a conglomerate of pebbles and red clay, plastered and tiled. It is the seat of a bishop, and has a military station and depot, and an arsenal for the construction of small vessels for the protection of the rivers. As early as 1722 a number of Portuguese, attracted by the discovery of gold, formed the settlement of Senhor Bom Jesus de Cuyabá, aud two years later, such was the influx of population, it was raised to the rank of a city by the governor of São Paulo. Its prosperity dates, however, from 1856, when the navigability of the upper tributaries of the Paraguay had been demonstrated, and when the outlet by the rivers took the place of the former toilsome caravan passage overland to the Atlantic towns and ports. Now a regular fortnightly line of Brazilian steamers unites Monte Video and Rio with Curumba on the Upper Paraguay, whence, after the collection of custom duties, the goods are transshipped in smaller steamers and boats to Cuyabá. The chief import trade is in manufactured goods, hardwares, and salt; the exports are hides, cattle, ipecacuanha, vanilla, and some diamonds. Other products of the district of Cuyabá are manioc, rice, maize, sugar, cotton, tobacco, coffee, and beans. The population is estimated at from 18,000 to 20,000.

The Cuyabá riveris navigable from 14° 49'S., and from its proximity at this point to the navigation of the Tapajos by its tributary the Arinos, is probably destined to form part of a great future highway between the Amazon and La Plata. Proof of the practicability of this route was afforded by the portage of large canoes, laden with merchandize from Pará, across the water-parting to the Cuyabá river in 1846.
