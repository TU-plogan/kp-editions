CORNWALLIS, Charles, Second Earl and First Marquis (1738-1805), was the eldest son of Charles, the first earl Cornwallis. Having been educated at Eton and St John’s College, Cambridge, he entered the army F or some time he was member of Parliament for Eye; in 1761 served a campaign in Germany, and was gazetted to a lieutenant-colonelcy in the l2th Foot. In 1762 he succeeded to the earldom and estates of his father; in 1765 he was made aide-de-camp to the king and gentleman of the bedchamber; in 1766 he obtained a colonelcy in the 33d Foot; and in 1770 he was appointed governor of the Tower. In public life, he was distinguished by independence of character and inflexible integrity; he voted without regard to party, and opposed the ministerial action against Wilkes and in the case of the American colonies. But when the War of Independence broke out, he accompanied his-regiment across the Atlantic, and served not without success as major-general. In 1780 he was appointed to command the British forces in South Carolina, and in the same year he routed Gates at Camden. In 1781 he defeated Greene at Guilford, and made a destructive raid into Virginia; and in the same year he was besieged at York Town by French and American armies and a French fleet, and was forced to capitulate. With him fell the English cause in the United States. He not only escaped censure, however, but in 1786 received a vacant garter, and was appointed governor-general of India and commander-in-chief in Bengal. As an administrator he projected many reforms, but he was interrupted in his work by the advance of Tippoo Sahib. In 1791 he assumed in person the conduct of the war and captured Bangalore; and in 1792 he laid siege to Seringapatam, and concluded a treaty with Tiρρoo Sahib, which stripped the latter of half his realm, and placed his two sons as hostages in the hands of the English. For the Permanent Settlement of the Land

Revenue under his administration, see Bengal, vol. iii. ρ. 570. He returned to England in 1793, received a marquisate and a seat in the Privy Council, and was made master-general of the ordnance with a place in the Cabinet. Five years afterwards (21st June 1798) he was appointed to the viceroyalty of Ireland, and the zeal with which he strove to pacify the country gained him the respect and good-will of both Roman Catholics and Orangemen. On 17th July a general amnesty was proclaimed, and a few weeks afterwards the French army under Humbert was surrounded and forced to surrender. In 1801 Cornwallis was replaced by Lord Hardwicke, and soon after he was appointed plenipotentiary to negotiate the treaty of Amiens (1802). In 1805 he was again sent to India as governorgeneral. He was in ill-health when he arrived at Calcutta, and while hastening up the country to assume command of the troops, he died at Ghazepore, in the province of Benares, October 5, 1805.
