COLLODION (from κoλλa, glue), a colourless, viscid fluid, made by dissolving gun-cotton and the other varieties of pyroxylin, or cellulotrinitrin, C g H 7 O 2 (NO 3 ) 3 , in a mix ture of alcohol and ether. It was discovered in 1848 by Maynard in Boston. The quality of collodion differs according to the proportions of alcohol and ether and the nature of the pyroxylin it contains. Collodion in wsliich there is a great excess of ether gives by its evaporation a very tough film; the film left by collodion containing a large quantity of alcohol is soft and easily torn; but in hot climates the presence of an excess of alcohol is an advantage, as it prevents the rapid evaporation of the ether. Pyroxylin for the making of collodion for photographic purposes is prepared by immersing cotton-wool ten minutes in a mixture of nitric and sulphuric acids at a temperature of 140° Fahr. When tolerably strong acids at a low temperature are employed, the nitric acid being in by far the larger quantity, the pyroxylin made requires an amount of alcohol equal to only about ⅜th or τ ⅛th that of the ether in bulk. According to Μ. Miallie, the most explosive kinds of gun-cotton are not the best adapted for the preparation of collodion; a pyroxylin very soluble in ether is in his process made from 2 parts by weight of carded cotton to 40 parts of nitre and 60 of concentrated sulphuric acid. Under the microscope, the film produced by collodion of good quality appears translucent and colourless, the cotton being perfectly dissolved; old collodion that does not give good photographic impressions sufficiently quickly exhibits liquid globules of modified ether. The film from collodion which is too alcoholic has the microscopic appearance of cellular tissue; and when water has been present, the fibrillae of the cotton become apparent as amorphous flocks. To preserve collodion it should be kept cool, and out of the action of the light; iodized collodion that has been discoloured by the development of free iodine may be purified by the immersion in it of a strip of silver foil. For the iodizing of collodion, ammonium bromide and iodide and the iodides of calcium and cadmium are the agents employed. The first to suggest the use of collodion in photography was Μ. le Grey, in Paris; Mr F. S. Archer, in February 1851, recommended iodized collodion instead of paper for the taking of photographs (The Chemist, New, Ser., vol. ii. No. xix. ρ. 257, March 1851). In surgery collodion is used in its usual condition, or combined with elastic and other substances, for the protection of inflamed surfaces, as in erysipelas and smallpox. When poured upon the skin, it forms a thin film which contracts as it dries. Flexible collodion, which, as it does not crack in drying, is preferable for surgical purposes to the ordinary preparation, is made from collodion 6 oz., Canada balsam 120 grs., castoroil one fluid drachm. Vesicating or Blistering Collodion contains cantharidin as one of its constituents. The styptic colloid of Richardson is a strong solution of tannin in guncotton collodion. Small balloons are manufactured from collodion by coating the interior of glass-globes with the liquid; the film when dry is removed from the glass by applying suction to the mouth of the vessel. Μ. E. Gripon has found (Compt. liend., April 5, 1875) that collodion membranes, like glass, reflect light and polarize it both by transmission and reflection; they also transmit a very much larger proportion of radiant heat, for the study of which they are preferable to mica.
