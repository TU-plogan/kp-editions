CONSTABLE, Archibald (1774-1827), the well-known Edinburgh publisher, was born in the parish of Carnbee, Fifeshire, on the 24th February 1774. Having been educated at the parish school, he was, at his own request, apprenticed to a bookseller in Edinburgh, named Peter Hill. From the first he took a great interest in books; and he obtained permission from his master to attend book sales, and purchase rare works, of which he drew up carefully executed catalogues. When not yet twenty-one years of. age he had married and commenced business on his own account. He took special interest in Scottish literature; the rare works in that department which he offered for sale soon brought him into notice, and from this and from his genial disposition and his unprecedented liberality towards authors, his business grew rapidly. In 1801 he became proprietor of the Farmers' Magazine and the Scots' Magazine, and on the 10th October 1802 he published the first number of the Edinburgh Review. Constable was for many years on the most intimate and friendly relations with Sir Walter Scott. In January 1802 he had a share in the publication of the Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border, and afterwards published a large proportion of Scott’s poems and novels. Besides these, he published the Annual Register, and the works of Dugald Stewart, Brown, Playfair, and Leslie. In 1812 he purchased the copyright of the Encyclopa-dia Britannica, to which he added the supplement to the 4th, 5th, and 6th editions (1815-1824), extending to six volumes, and containing the celebrated dissertations by Stewart, Playfair, and Brande. Not the least important of his undertakings was Constable’s Miscellany, projected in 1825, consisting of a series of original works, and standard works republished in a cheap form, the earliest and one of the most famous of the attempts to popularize wholesome literature. In 1826 pecuniary difficulties in which the firm of Constable and Co. became involved (its liabilities exceeding £250,000) obliged it to stop payment. From this time Constable’s health gave way, and he died on 2lst July 1827, having, by his generous dealings with authors, his literary enthusiasm, and his efforts to promote the diffusion of standard literature, gained for himself one of the most distinguished names among British publishers.
