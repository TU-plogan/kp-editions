CLOVIO, Giulio (1498-1578), by birth a Croat and by profession a priest, is said to have learned the elements of design in his own country, and to have studied afterwards with intense diligence at Rome under Giulio Romano, and at Verona under Girolamo deâ€™ Libri. He excelled in historical pieces and portraits, painting as for microscopical examination, and yet contriving to handle his subjects with great force and precision. In the Vatican library is preserved a MS. life of Frederick, duke of Urbino, superbly illustrated by Clovio, who is facile princeps among Italian miniaturists.
