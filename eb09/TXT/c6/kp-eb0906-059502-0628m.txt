CROKER, Thomas Crofton (1798-1854), an antiquary and humourist, was born in Cork in 1798. He was apprenticed to a merchant, but in 1819, through the interest of John Wilson Croker, who had been a friend of his father, he became a junior clerk in the Admiralty, where he afterwards obtained one of the first clerkships. In 1825 he produced his most popular book, the Fairy Legends of the South of Ireland (reprinted in 1834), which he followed up by the publication of his Legends of the Lakes, his Adventures of Barney Mahoney, and an edition of the Popular Songs of Ireland. In 1827 he was made a member of the Irish Academy; and in 1839 and 1840 he helped to found the Camden and Percy SocietieÎµ, for the former of which he published (1841) an edition of certain Narratives Illustrative of the Contests in Ireland in 1641 and 1690, and for the latter his Revolution in Ireland in 1688, and several other works. He was also a member of the Hakluyt, Archaeological, and Antiquarian Societies. He died in London, August 8, 1854.
