COUNTY is the chief of the administrative areas into which England is divided. This is an ancient division, and, according to the popular manner of accounting for the origin of social institutions, is attributed to the wisdom of our early kings, and more particularly of King Alfred. It is tolerably clear, however, that this theory is a reversal of the natural process, and that, instead of counties having been formed by the division of the country, the country itself was formed by the aggregation of counties. The county, in fact, is the representative of an independent [9:6:513] kingdom or community, now long merged in the larger unity of the English kingdom. The same mistake that has been made as to the historical relations of the county and the kingdom is repeated in the popular accounts of the subdivisions of the county itself. Alfred the Great, it is said, divided the county into hundreds, and these again into tithings. The truth is exactly the contrary—the subdivision of the county being an earlier aggregate than the county itself. The parish, the manor, and the township all appear to be traceable to the independent tribal settlement—the village community—of the early Saxons. They appear in history with their political and judicial organism complete. A combination of these units forms the district of the hundred; and a combination of hundreds forms the county. All of these groups have the same kind of organization. They all have their moots or meetings, partly judicial partly political in character, and their head-man or reeve. The Witenagemot of the Saxon kingdom is the folk-moot for the whole kingdom, corresponding to the folk-moot for the shire or county.

In the period preceding the Norman Conquest two officers appear at the head of the county organization. These are the ealdorman or earl and the scirgerefa or sheriff. The latter was more particularly the representative of the king; the former represented, in dignity at least, the head of the county before ithad ceased to be an independent community. After the Conquest the sheriff became a purely royal officer (υice-comes or ballivus). He held an annual court (the sheriff’s tourn or leet) to which the vassals of the king were suitors. These were the judicial tribunals for the people within the jurisdiction of the county. An appeal lay from them to the king, and the growth of the king’s court, in its three developments—King’s Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer—tended to draw suits at the first instance away from the county court into the higher tribunal. The county court, moreover, arranged the assessment of rates, and the sheriff was, in fact, the financial representative of the Crown within his district. When the principle of representation came into existence, the county court was the assembly which elected the knights of the shire. The ancient offices of coroner and verderer were also filled up by the same assembly. The county organization thus in many points retained the features of an independent political society. From the time of the Plantagenets its importance in the constitution declined.

The office of sheriff in England has lost all its financial and nearly all its judicial duties. He is now chiefly a ministerial officer—he arrests or imprisons, summons and returns the jury, carries the judgment or sentence of the court into effect, &c.

The military functions of the sheriff were in the reign of Henry VIII. (or, according to some, Edward VI.) handed over to a new officer, the lord-lieutenant, who is now more prominently associated with the headship of the county than the sheriff is. The office is honorary, and is held during royal pleasure, but virtually for life. The Government of the day invariably appoints one of its own supporters,— generally a person of high position in the county. He is the chief conservator of the peace and keeper of the records of quarter sessions. He is also commander of the militia and yeomanry of the county, whose officers he appoints.

In the United States of America the county forms the section into which the State is divided; it is again subdivided into townships. The financial affairs of the county are superintended by county officers, and each county is provided with a court of inferior jurisdiction. Louisiana is the only State which is divided into parishes, instead of counties.

The Counties Palatine are three in number, viz., Durham, Chester, and Lancaster. The counts palatine (earl of Chester, bishop of Durham, and duke of Lancaster) exercised royal rights within their districts. Chester was united with the Crown under Henry HL, but the palatinate jurisdictions survived in the other two cases. The Court of Common Pleas at Lancaster and the Court of Common Pleas at Durham are among the courts -whose jurisdiction is transferred to the High Court of Justice by the Judicature Act, 1873. The palatine authority of the bishop of Durham was vested in the Crown by 6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 19. The duchy of Lancaster has still its own chancellor, in whose name a chancery court is held, presided over by a vice-chancellor, and the courts of the Jord chancellor of England do not run in the districts. The chancery court is not affected by the Judicature Act. Section 99 of that Act, provides that, from and after the commencement of this Act, the counties palatine of Lancaster and Durham shall respectively cease to be counties palatine, so far as respects the issue of commissions of assize, or other like commissions, but not further or otherwise.

Counties of cities, or counties corporate, are cities which have acquired the privileges of counties. The officers of the counties in which these towns are situated have no jurisdiction within them. Among them are London, York, and Bristol.

County Court.— The jurisdiction of the ancient County Court lias within recent years been revised and extended with the view of making justice cheaper and more accessible, especially in disputes about small amounts. The 9 and 10 Vict. c. 95 (County Courts Act, 1846), reciting various Acts, the provisions of which should bo amended, and that one rule, and manner of proceeding for the lecovery of small debts and demand, should prevail throughout, England; that the County Court is a court of ancient jurisdiction, having cognizance of all pleas of personal actions to any amount by virtue of a writ of justices issued in that behalf; that the proceedings in the County Court are dilatory and expensive, and that it is expedient to alter and regulate the manner of proceeding in the said courts for the recovery of small debts and demands; that the courts established under the said recited Acts of Parliament, or such of them as ought to be continued, should be holden after the passing of this Act as branches of the County Court under the provisions of this Act,—enacts that “it shall be lawful for her Majesty, with the advice of her Privy Council, to order that this Act shall be put in force in such county or counties as to her Majesty, with the advice aforesaid, shall seem fit.” By section 2 her Majesty, with the advice aforesaid, may divide the whole or part of any such county, including all counties of cities and counties of towns, cities, boroughs, towns, ports, and places, liberties and franchises therein contained into districts, and may order that the County Court shall be holden under this Act in each of such districts. Courts under this Act are to have “all the jurisdiction and powers of the County Court for recovery of debts and demand as altered by this Act,” and shall be courts of record. For all other purposes the County Court shall be holden as if this Act had not passed. Judges, treasurers, registrars, high bailiffs, and their assistants were to be appointed for each district. The 21 and 22 Vict. c. 74 § 3 limits the number of judges to sixty. The salary of a County Court judge was originally fixed at £1200, but as a rule he now receives £1500. He must be a barrister-at-law of seven years’ standing; after appointment he cannot sit as a member of Parliament, or practise at the bar. The appointment is made by the lord chancellor, with whom also rests the power of dismissal for sufficient cause shown. Lawyers of considerable repute have in many cases accepted these appointments.

The jurisdiction of the County Courts was at first confined to pleas in personal actions, when the sum claimed was not more than £20, but it has since been considerably enlarged. The limit was raised to £50 by the 13 and 14 Vict. c. 61. A jurisdiction in ejectment, where the annual rent or value of the land was not more than £20, was conferred by the County Courts Act, 1867. Up to 1865 the jurisdiction of the County Courts was with a few trifling exceptions a common law jurisdiction, but the County Courts Act of that year conferred an equitable jurisdiction, limited as to tha value of the amount at stake to £500. This Act, and the power to set up equitable defences to actions under the Common Law Procedure Act, 1854, are noticeable in the history of English law, as anticipations of the fusion of law and equity now being carried out under the recent Judicature Act. Jurisdiction in probate (up to £200), in admiralty, in bankruptcy, and certain powers in aid of the jurisdiction of other courts nave also been conferred by separate Acts. By the consent of parties the court may have jurisdiction in any action. In certain cases (e.g∙, recovery of penalties for [9:6:514] bribery at municipal elections, &c. ) the County Courts have exclusive jurisdiction. Otherwise they have jurisdiction concurrently with the superior courts, but when a case which a County Court might have tried is brought into a superior court, the costs will not in general be granted. The County Courts Act, 1867, dealing with this subject enacts (§ 5) that costs shall not be recoverable by the plaintiff in any action in the superior courts, when the amount recovered does not exceed £20 in a case of contract, or £10 in a case of tort (civil injury)—unless the judge certify that there was a good reason for bringing the action in a superior court. By § 8 when any action of contract is brought in a superior court for a sum in dispute not exceeding £50, the judge may on the application of the defendant order the case to be sent to the County Court. By § 8 proceedings in equity may be transferred to the County Court which might have commenced therein; and. by § 10 in actions for tort, the judge may, on an affidavit by defendant that the plaintiff has no visible means of paying costs if unsuccessful, send down the case to the County Court. These provisions, which it will be observed only indirectly compel Buitors to resort to the County Courts in cases of minor importance, are embodied in the Judicature Act, 1873, by section 67 :—“The provisions contained in the fifth, seventh, eighth, and tenth sections of the County Court Act, 1867, shall apply to all actions commenced or pending in the said High Court of Justice on which any relief is Bought which can be given in a County Court.”

A County Court judge may determine all matters of fact as vzell as law, but a jury may be summoned at the option of either plaintiff or defendant -when the amount in dispute exceeds £5, and the judge may at his discretion summon a jury in any case. Counsel as well as attorneys may appear in the County Courts, but as the object of the legislature was to establish a cheap tribunal, costs are in the discretion of the judge, and the remuneration for professional services recoverable as costs is paid on a reduced scale. By the Judicature Act, 1873, appeals from County Courts and other inferior courts are heard in divisional courts of the High Court of Justice, consisting of such judges as may be assigned for that purpose, and the decision of any such divisional court shall be final, unless it gives special leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Acts relating to County Courts are now numerous, and through frequent amendment and repeal are in a state of great confusion. A Consolidation Act is much to be desired. (E. R.)
