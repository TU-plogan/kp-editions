CULLODEN, a desolate tract of moorland, otherwise known as Drummossie, about five and a half miles E. of Inverness in Scotland, celebrated as the scene of the battle of April 16, 1746, by which the fate of the house of Stuart was decided. A mile to the north is Culloden House, which at the time of the rebellion belonged to Duncan Forbes, the president of the Court of Session, and has since furnished the historical student with a valuable collection known as the Culloden Papers, ranging from 1625 to 1748. Discovered in 1812, they were published in 1815 by Duncan George Forbes, at that time the representative of the Culloden family.
