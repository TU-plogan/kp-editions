CRÉCY, or Cressy, a town of France, department of Somme, on the Maye, 12 miles N. by E. of Abbeville; though an ancient place it has now only about 1300 inhabitants. It is í’amons in history for the great victory gained here on the 26th of August 1346 by Edward III., with about 30,0l)0 men, over the French of Philip of Valois, said to be lOO,üOO strong, commanded by the Comte d’Alençon. T he flower of French chivalry, and the king of Bohemia, fighting for France, were slain in the battle. Here it was that the Black Prince gained his spurs, and that he adopted the triple feather crest of the fallen Bohemian king, with the motto Ich Dien, still worn by our princes of Wales. This battle was one of the earliest in which cannon were used by the English. This Crécy must not be mistaken for another small town of the same name in the department of Seine-et-Marne, on the Grand Morin, 25 miles east of Paris, also an ancient place formerly fortified with double ramparts and towers.
