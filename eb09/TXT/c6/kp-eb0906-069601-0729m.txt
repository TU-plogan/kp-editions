CULLERA, a walled seaport-town situated on the left bank of the River Jucar, near its mouth, in the province and 20 miles south of the capital of Valencia. It stands on the southern slope of the hill called Zorras, which terminates in Cape Cullera, on the outskirts of a fine agricultural district noted for its rice, and carries on a considerable coasting trade with France and the Mediterranean. Its streets are irregularly built, but clean, and there are three small plazas. An old castle, extensive barracks, churches, convents, and a hospital are its chief buildings. Agriculture and fishing are the chief industries. Population about 8000.
