CURTIUS, Mettus or Metius, the hero of two legends connected with the part of the Roman forum called the Lacus Curtius, which appears to have once been a marsh, and where sacrifices were regularly offered. The first legend makes him the leader of the Sabine army in a battle with the Romans under Tullus Hostilius. To escape from the attack of the Romans he was forced to ride into a swamp which occupied the spot, hence called the Lacus Curtius. The second legend, which is dated 362 b.c., tells how a gulf suddenly appeared in the forum, according to one account riven by a thunder-bolt, and the aruspices declared that it would never close till what was dearest to Rome was thrown therein. At this announcement a noble youth, Mettus Curtius, came forward, declaring that her citizens were the most valuable possessions of the city; and, armed and on horseback, he leapt into the chasm, which forthwith closed over his head.
