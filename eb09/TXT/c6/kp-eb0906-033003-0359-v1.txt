CONYBEARE, William Daniel (1787-1857), dean of Llandaff, an eminent geologist, born in London, June 7, 1787, was a grandson of Bishop Conybeare. He received his early education at Westminster School, and in 1805 went to Christ Church College, Oxford, where in 1808 he took his degree of B.A., as first-class in classics and second in mathematics, and that of Μ. A. three years later. Early attracted to the study of geology, he became one of the first members of the Geological Society, of which he was afterwards fellow, and to whose Transactions he contributed many important memoirs. His first paper was communicated in 1814. In his researches he was often associated with Buckland and Phillips. In 1821 he distinguished himself greatly by the first discovery and description of a skeleton of the plesiosaurus,—his account (partly conjectural reconstruction) being minutely confirmed by subsequent discoveries. Among his most important memoirs is that on the south-western coal district of England, written in conjunction with Dr Buckland, and published in 1824. His principal work, however, is the Outlines of the Geology of England and Wales, written in co-operation with W. Philips, and forming at the time of its appearance (1822) the best manual on the subject. Conybeare was a fellow of the Royal Society and a corresponding member of the Institute of France. He was appointed Bampton Lecturer in 1839, and was instituted to the deanery of Llandaff in 1845. The loss of his eldest son, W. J. Conybeare, joint author with Mr Howson of the Life and Letters of St Paul, preyed on his mind and hastened his end. He died at Itchenstoke, near Portsmouth, a few months after his son, August 12, 1857.
