CUSH, the eldest son of Ham, from whom seems to have been derived the name of the Land of Cush, which is commonly rendered by the Septuagint and by the Vulgate Ethiopia. The locality of the land of Cush is a question upon which eminent authorities have been divided; for while Bocliart maintained that it was exclusively in Arabia, Schulthess and Gesenius held that it is to be sought for nowhere but in Africa. Others again, such as Michaelis and Rosenmüller, have supposed that the name Cush was applied to tracts of country both in Arabia and Africa—a circumstance which would easily be accounted for on the very probable supposition that the descendants of the primitive Cushite tribes emigrated across the Red Sea from the one continent to the other. The existence of an African Cush cannot reasonably be questioned, though the term is employed in Scripture with great latitude, sometimes denoting an extensive but undefined country (Ethiopia), and at other times one particular kingdom (Meroë). It is expressly described by Ezekiel as lying to the south of Egypt beyond Syene; Mizraim and Cush (f.e., Egypt and Ethiopia) are often classed together by the prophets; the inhabitants are elsewhere spoken of in connection with the Lubim and Sukkiim, which were certainly nations of Africa, for they belonged to the vast army with which Shishak, king of Egypt, “came out” against Rehoboam, king of Judah; and, finally, in the ancient Egyptian inscriptions the country to the south of Egypt is called Keesh, or Kesh. Though there is a great lack of evidence to show that the name of Cush was ever applied to any part of Arabia, there seems no reason to doubt that a portion of the Cushite race did early settle there. In the 5th century the Himyarites, in the south of Arabia, were styled by Syrian writers Cushaeans and Ethiopians. By modern scholars the name Cushitic has been adopted as the designation of the early non-Semitic language of Babylonia; and the reasoning of Canon Rawlinson goes to show that there was a close connection between Babylon and Egypt.
