CREOLE (Spanish, Criollo), is a term which primarily was used to denote an inhabitant of the Spanish colonies who was descended from the European settlers, as distinguished from the aborigines, the negroes, and mulattoes. It is now more loosely employed, the name being frequently applied to a native of the West Indies, whose descent is partly but not entirely European. A part of the coloured population of Cuba are at times designated creole negroes, in contradistinction to those who were brought direct from Africa. The creole whites, owing to the enervating influence of the climate, are not a robust race, but exhibit an elegance of gait and a suppleness of joint that are rare among Europeans.
