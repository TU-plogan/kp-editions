CUNARD, Sir Samuel (1787-1865), baronet,· civil engineer, founder of the Cunard line of Atlantic steam-ships, was born at Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1787. He was the son of a merchant, and was himself trained for the pursuits of commerce, in which, by his abilities and enterprizing spirit, he attained a conspicuous position. When, in the early years of steam navigation, the English Government made known its desire to substitute steam vessels for the sailing ships then employed in the mail service between [9:6:707] England and America, Canard heartily entered into the scheme, came to England, and accepted the Government tender for carrying it out. A company was formed, the members of which were Canard, Messrs Burns of Glasgow, and Messrs Maclver of Liverpool, these two firms being then proprietors of rival lines of coasting steamers between Glasgow and Liverpool. For the first contract with the Government four steam-vessels were built, and the first voyage was successfully made by the “Britannia” from Liverpool to Boston, U.S., between July 4 and 19, 1840. Such was the small beginning of an undertaking which in the course of thirty-seven years has grown into one of the vastest of private enterprizes, and may even rank in importance, as to the extent of interests involved in it, and the number of hands employed, with railway and other public companies. In 1852 the company began to substitute iron screw steamers for the wooden vessels with paddlewheels in use up to that time. The Cunard fleet has always borne the highest character for the build, manning, management, and provisioning of the ships; and the reward of the scrupulous care exercised has been a rare immunity from what are called “casualties.” In acknowledgment of his energetic and successful services Cunard was, in 1859, created a baronet. He died in London, April 28, 1865.
