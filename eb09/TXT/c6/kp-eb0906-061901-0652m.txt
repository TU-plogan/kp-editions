CROWE, Eyre Evans (1799-1868), journalist and historian, was born about the year 1799. He commenced his work as a writer for the London newspaper press in connection with the now defunct Morning Chronicle, and he afterwards became a leading contributor to the Examiner and the Daily News. Of the latter journal he was principal editor for some time previous to his death. The department he specially cultivated was that of Continental history and politics, with which he made himself intimately acquainted by means of study, travel, and correspondence with leading public men abroad. To permanent literature he made contributions of considerable value in his Lives of Foreign Statesmen (1880), The Greek and the Turk (1853), and Reigns of Louis XVII I. and Charles X. (1854). These were followed by his most important work, thp History of France (5 vols., 1858-68), which is full, impartial, and laborious, and written in a clear though somewhat colourless and unimpassioned style. It is founded upon original sources, in order to consult which the author resided for a considerable time in Paris. He died in London on the 25th February 1868.
