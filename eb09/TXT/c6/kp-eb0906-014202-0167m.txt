COLLEGE(Collegium) f ∖ n Roman law signified a number of persons associated together by the possession of common functions,—a body of colleagues. Its later meaning applied to any union of persons, and Collegium was the equivalent of ixaipda. In many respects, e.g., in the distinction between the responsibilities and rights of the society and those of individual members thereof, the collegium was what we should now call a corporation (see Corporation). Collegia might exist for purposes of trade like our guilds, or for religious purposes (e.g., the college of augurs, of pontifices,.&c.), or sor political purposes, e.g., tribunorum plebis collegia. By the Roman law a collegium must have at least three members. The name is now usually applied to educational corporations, the most important of which are the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge. In the numerous statutes relating to colleges the colleges of Winchester and Eton are usually associated with those of .Oxford and Cambridge.

These colleges are in the eye of the law eleemosynary corporations. In some of the earlier statutes of Queen Elizabeth they are spoken of as having an ecclesiastical character, but the doctrine of the common law since the Reformation has been that they are purely lay corporations, notwithstanding that most or all of their members may be persons in priest’s orders. This is said to have been settled by Patrick’s case (see Raymond’s Reports').

Colleges appear to have grown out of the voluntary association of students and teachers at the university. According to some accounts these must at one time have been numerous and flourishing beyond anything we are now acquainted with. We are told, for example, of 300 halls or societies at Oxford, and 30,000 students. Into the truth of .these statements, or into the causes which led to the reduction in the number of scholars, we need not now enter. In early times there seems to have been a strong desire to confine the scholars to certain licensed houses, beyond the influence of the townspeople. Men of wealth and culture, and notably the political bishops and chancellors of England, obtained charters from the Crown for the incorporation of societies of scholars, and these in time became exclusively the places of abode for students attending the university. At the same time the corporations thus founded were not necessarily attached to the locality of the university. The early statutes of Merton College, for example, allow the residence of the college to be shifted as occasion required; and the foundations of Wolsey at Oxford and Ipswich seem to have been the same in intention. In later times the university and the colleges became coextensive; every member of the university had to attach himself to some college or hall, and every person admitted to a college or hall was obliged to matriculate himself in the university.

In Ayliffe’s Ancient and Present State of the University of Oxford it is stated that a college must be “made up of three persons (at least) joined in community. And the reason of this almost seems to speak its own necessity, without the help of any express law to countenance it: because among two persons only there cannot be, in fact, a major part; and then if any disagreement should happen to arise between them it cannot be, in fact, brought to a conclusion by such a number alone in case both the parties should firmly adhere to their dissenting opinions; and thus it is declared by the civil law. But by the canon law it is known to be otherwise; for by that law two persons in number may make and constitute a college, forasmuch as according to this law two persons make and constitute an assembly or congregation. The common law of England, or rather the constant usage of our princes in erecting aggregate bodies, which has established this rule among us as a law, has been herein agreeable to the method and doctrine of the civil law, for that in all their grants and charters of incorporation of colleges they have not framed any aggregate body consisting of less than three iu number.” Another principle, apparently derived from the civil law, is that a man cannot be a fellow in two colleges at the same time. The law of England steadily resisted any attempt to introduce the principle of inequality into colleges. An Act of Henry VIII. (33, c. 27), reciting that divers founders of colleges have given in their statutes a power of veto to individual members, enacts that every [9:6:143] statute made by any such founder, whereby the grant or election of the governor or ruler with the assent of the most part of such corporation should be in any wise hindered by any one or more being the lesser number (contrary to the common law), shall be void.

The corporation consists of a head or master, fellows, and scholars. Students, not being on the foundation, residing in the college, are not considered to be members of the corporation. The governing body in all cases is the head and fellows.

It is considered essential to corporations of an ecclesiastical or educational character that they should have a visitor whose duty it is to see that the statutes of the founder are obeyed. The duties of this officer have been ascertained by the courts of Jaw in a great variety of decided cases. Subject to such restrictions as may be imposed on him by the statutes of the college, his duties are generally to interpret the statutes of the college in disputed cases, and to enforce them where they have been violated. For this purpose he is empowered to “visit” the society—usually at certain stated intervals. In questions within his jurisdiction his judgment is conclusive, but his jurisdiction does not extend to any cases under the common laws of the country, or to trusts attached to the college. Generally the visitorship resides in the founder and his heirs unless he has otherwise appointed, and in default of him in the Crown.

The fellowships, scholarships, <fcc., of colleges were until a comparatively recent date subject to various restrictions. Birth in a particular county, education at a particular school, relationship to the founder, and holy orders, are amongst the most usual of the conditions giving a preferential or conclusive claim to the emoluments. Most of these restrictions have been or are being swept away. See Universities.

The colleges of the English universities are large landowners. A royal commission in 187-t reported the external income of the colleges of Oxford to be £307,369, 17s. 2d., and of Cambridge £264,256, l7s. 10^d. These sums are mainly derived from landed property, and are exclusive of the revenues of the universities. By several Acts of Parliament colleges are allowed to sell their real property with the consent of the copyhold commissioners, who take care that the purchase-money is laid out in other real property. In college and other corporation property a system of letting land under beneficial leases— i.e., at less than the full yearly rent, and recoverable every seven years on payment of a fine—has long prevailed, and is believed to be responsible for the alleged inferior condition of land belonging to corporations. The system is now being superseded by leases at rack-rent.

At Oxford, in addition to the colleges, there are four or five halls, which differ from colleges mainly in not being corporate bodies. Their property is held in trust for them by the university.

In England the colleges have through their tutors and lecturers supplied nearly all the teaching of the universities—the lectures of the professors being either supernumerary or merely ornamental. Of late years colleges have combined their forces for the purpose of establishing common systems of lectures, and there has been a strong desire to reconstitute the teaching power of the universities. Commissions are now being proposed for Oxford and Cambridge, which will have to settle these and other problems of the higher education.

Most of the colleges of Oxford and Cambridge are old foundations—only a few dating from times posterior to the Reformation. Among recent foundations are Downing College at Cambridge, Keble College at Oxford (which is governed by a board or council of trustees), and the restoration of Magdalen Hall at Oxford, now endowed and incorporated under the name of Hertford College.

Among educational corporations under the same title elsewhere, Phillimore (Ecclesiastical Law) mentions King’s College and University College, London, Sion College, St Bees, St David’s, Lampeter, &c. The distinction between college and university is found also at St Andrews, and in the more recently founded university of Durham and the Queen’s University in Ireland.
