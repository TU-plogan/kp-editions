COLOSSAe, a once large and important city of Asia Minor, iu. Phrygia Major, on the Lycus, a branch of the Maeander. The notices of Colossae in ancient history are few aud brief. Xerxes passed through it on his way to Greece, 481 b.c., and at the close of the same century it was visited by Cyrus the younger. It is described by Xenophon in the Anabasis as being at that period a large and flourishing city. Like Laodicea, and other cities in that part of Phrygia, Colossae carried on an extensive trade in wool, and derived a large revenue from the skill of its inhabitants in dyeing that article. After the time of Cyrus the city seems to have gradually decayed, till in the Middle Ages it disappeared altogether. Near its ruins there sprang up another town called Chonae, the birthplace of the Byzantine historian, Nicetas Choniates, now represented by the town of Khonas. Excavations made in the neighbourhood of this place have brought to light the ruins of a large city, which is believed, with good reason, to be Colossae. The Epistle to the Colossians (see below) is addressed to the inhabitants of this city, iu which one of the earliest of the Christian churches in Asia was planted.
