CROWLAND, or Croyland, an ancient town and parish of Lincolnshire, situated in a low flat district, about eight miles north-east from Peterborough. It stands at the confluence of the Welland and the Catwater drain; and at their junction there is a curious triangular bridge (figured in art. Bridges, vol. iv. p. 331), passable only on foot. The origin of Crowland was in a hermitage founded in the 7th century by St Guthloc; an abbey was founded in 714 by King Ethelbald, which was burnt in 870 by the Danes, restored by Ethelred IL, burnt again in 1091, and again rebuilt in 1112. Of this there are still some interesting remains. Among its abbots was the historian Ingulphus. Weekly markets are held at Crowland, and there are three fairs annually. Population (1871), 2459.
