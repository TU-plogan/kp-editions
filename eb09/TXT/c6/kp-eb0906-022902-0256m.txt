COMPTON Henry (1632-1713), bishop of London, was the youngest son of the earl of Northampton. After the restoration of Charles II. he became cornet in a regiment of horse, but he soon quitted the army for the church. He was made bishop of Oxford in 1674, and in the following year was translated to the see of London. He was also appointed a member of the Privy Council, and intrusted with the education of the two princesses—Mary and Anne. Compton showed a liberality most unusual at the time to Protestant dissenters, whom he wished to reunite with the established church. He held several conferences on the subject with the clergy of his diocese; and in the hope of influencing candid minds by means of the opinions of unbiassed foreigners, he obtained letters treating of the question (since printed at the end of Stillingfleet’s Unreasonableness of Separation), from Le Moyne, professor of divinity at Leyden, and the famous French Protestant divine, Claude. But to Roman Catholicism he was strongly opposed. On the accession of James II. he consequently lost his seat in the council and his deanery in the Chapel Royal; and for his firmness in refusing to suspend Dr Sharpe, whose writings against Popery had rendered him obnoxious to the king, he was himself suspended. At the Revolution, Compton embraced the cause of William and Mary; he performed the ceremony of their coronation; his old position was restored to him; and, among other appointments, he was chosen as one of the commissioners ∙ for revising the liturgy. During the reign of Anne he remained a member of the Privy Council, and he was one of the commissioners appointed to arrange the terms of the union of England and Scotland; but, to his bitter disappointment, his claims to the primacy were twice passed over.

He published, besides several theological works, A Translation from the Italian of the Life of Donna Olympia Maladichini, who governed the Church daring the time of Pope Innocent X., which ιcas from the year 1644 to 1655 (1667), and A Translation from the French of the Jesuits' Intrigues (1669).
