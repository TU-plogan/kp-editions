CUPPING. The operation of cupping is one of the methods adopted by surgeons to draw blood from an inflamed part in order to relieve the inflammation. The apparatus required is a spirit lamp and a glass cup with a rounded edge. The skin is washed and dried; the air is rarefied in the cup by the flame of the lamp; the cup is then firmly applied to the skin. A partial vacuum forms within the cup as the air cools, and the blood rushes from the neighbouring parts to the skin under the cup. Either the blood is drawn from the patient’s body through a number of small wounds which are made in the skin, with a special instrument, before the cup is applied; or the cup is simply applied to the unbroken skin and the blood drawn into the subcutaneous tissue within the circumference of the cup. The result of both methods is the same,— namely, a withdrawal of blood locally from the inflamed part. The former is called moist cupping, the latter dry cupping. Moist cupping is inapplicable on exposed surface, as the mark of the small skin wounds is indelible.
