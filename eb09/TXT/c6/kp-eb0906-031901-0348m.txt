CONTI, Prince of, the title assumed by a younger branch of the House of Condé. Armand de Bourbon, prince of Conti (1629-1666), one of the princes of the blood who took part in the wars of the Fronde, was son of Henry, prince of Condé, and brother of the Great Condé. Originally destined for the church on account of the weakness of his health and the deformity of his person, he received several rich benefices, and studied at the Sorbonne, but did not enter into orders. Wanting in strength of character, he was throughout life the follower of his sister, the duchess of Longueville, whose influence over him was such as to give rise to scandal. He was induced by her to join the old Fronde, and was appointed commander-in-chief of its forces during the siege of Paris (1648); but he contented himself with riding every day at their head through the streets, never failing to leave them as they passed out of the gates. At the end of the contest the whole Condé family came into political agreement, and Conti shared his brother’s imprisonment (1650). After his release his engagement to be married to the profligate Mlle, de Chevreuse was broken off by the prince of Condé, who had been won over to the court party by extravagant promises. In Condé’s second rebellion Conti was concerned; but when the former fled to Spain, he made his peace with the court, married Mazarin’s niece, and obtained the government of Guienne, together with the command in Catalonia, in which latter capacity he was not distinguished. He followed his sister in her conversion, entering into all her enthusiastic views, and maintaining constant correspondence with her. He wrote Du devoir des grands et des devoirs des gouverneurs de province; Lettres sur la grace; and Traité de la comédie et des spectacles selon la tradition de l’Eglise. (See the numerous Mémoires of the time and the Lettres de Mme. de Sévignêst His second son, François Louis, prince of Conti (1664-1709), fought with much distinction in [9:6:320] several campaigns; and, being distinguished by information, wit, attractive manners, and never-failing affability, he enjoyed, heartless as he was, a wonderful popularity. But this very popularity, together with a sneer he had incautiously uttered against the king, caused his banishment to Chantilly. In 1697 he was elected king of Poland, but on reaching that country he found the throne in the possession of the elector of Saxony, and at once retired without making any attempt to dispossess his rival. (See the Mémoires de Saint-Simon, and Desormeaux, Histoire de la Maison de Bourbon.) Louis François, prince of Conti (1717-1776), the grandson of François, was a brave and popular general. He was engaged in the war caused by the claims of Maria Theresa to the imperial throne; he commanded the army which crossed the Alps into Italy and defeated the Sardinians in 1744; and he also served in Germany and Flanders in 1745 and 1746. Not, however, being allowed to take part in the Seven Years’ War, he supported the Parliament of Paris against the court, and earned the nickname of “the Advocate.” His son was the last of the house of Conti.
