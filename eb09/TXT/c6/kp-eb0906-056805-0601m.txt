CRESPI, Giuseppe Maria (1665-1747), an Italian painter, called “Il Spagnuolo” from his fondness for rich apparel, was born at Bologna, and was trained under Angelo Toni, Domenico Canuti, and Carlo Cignani. He then went through a course of copying from Correggio and Baroccio; this he followed up with a journey to Venice for the sake of Titian and Paul Veronese; and late in life he proclaimed himself a follower of Guercino and Pietro da Cortona. He was a good colourist and a facile executant, and was wont to employ the camera obscura with great success in the treatment of light and shadow; but he was careless and unconscientious. He was a clever portrait painter and a brilliant caricaturist; and his etchings after Rembrandt and Salvator are in some demand. His greatest work, a Massacre ©f the Innocents, is at Bologna; but the Dresden Gallery possesses twelve examples of him, among which is his celebrated series of the Seven Sacraments.
