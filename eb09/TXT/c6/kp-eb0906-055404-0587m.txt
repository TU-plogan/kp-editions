CRATES, of Thebes, a Cynic philosopher of the 4th century b.c., was a pupil of Diogenes, whose extreme cynicism he rivalled. He gave up his large fortune, directing the banker to whom he intrusted it to give it to his sons if they should prove fools, but to the poor if his sons should prove philosophers. He besides attacked all who did not follow his example, not scrupling to force himself into their houses, and thus he gained the nickname of the “door-opener.” Poor and ugly as he was, he gained the affection of a young woman of good family, Hipparchia, who refused to marry the most eligible suitors, for his sake threatened to commit suicide, and at last was allowed by her parents to become his wife. Crates was the author of a number of philosophical letters; but those published under his name among the Aldine classics and by Boissonade are not genuine.
