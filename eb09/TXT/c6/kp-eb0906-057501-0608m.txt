CREUZOT, Le, a town of France, department of Saône-et-Loire, 12 miles S.S.E. of Autun, on the high ground which extends between the Cevennes and Côte d’Or, 1355 feet above the sea. Situated in a district which is rich in coal and iron, it has the most extensive iron works in France, rivalling those of Birmingham, Essen, or Liège, and since 1837 has gathered round these a population amounting in 1872 to 21,408. Three distinct though connected industries are in full activity about Creuzot,—the mining of coal in the Creuzot-Blanzy basin, the smelting of iron ore, and the manufacture of all kinds of machinery. The factories occupy about 300 acres, of which 50 are covered with workshops, where locomotives and marine engines are constructed for all parts of the world. About 100,000 tons of rails are turned out annually. Besides its immediate supply Creuzot draws to it a large part of the coal taken from the central basin of France; excepting the mineral from Change near Epinac, little native French iron is used in the factories, which are chiefly provided from Elba and Algeria. Railways connect Creuzot with the Canal due Centre and the Saône, and westward with the navigation of the Loire.
