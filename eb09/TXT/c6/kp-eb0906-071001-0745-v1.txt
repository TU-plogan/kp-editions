CURES, an old town of the Sabines, not far from the left bank of the Tiber, about 25 miles from Rome. It was renowned in Roman story as the birth-place of Tatius, the colleague of Romulus, and of Numa the second king of Rome; and, according to the belief of the ancients, the term Quirites, the distinguishing epithet of the Roman people, was derived from its name. If it be true, as Strabo asserts, that Cures was at one time a large city, it early fell into decay. About 100 b.c. it was colonized by Sulla, and continued to prosper till about the 4th century of the Christian era. It was finally destroyed by the Lombards before the end of the 6th century. Remains of the town have been discovered at the modern village of Correse.
