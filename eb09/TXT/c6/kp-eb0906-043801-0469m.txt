CORREZE, an inland department of France, formed from the southern portion of the old province of Limousin, is bounded N. by the departments of Haute-Vienne and Creuse, E. by Puy-de-Dôme and Cantal, S. by Lot, and W. by Dordogne, and lies between 44° 55' and 45° 40' N. lat. The surface of the country is in general hilly, but in the south-west there are some plains. In the north an offshoot of the mountains of Auvergne separates the basins of the Dordogne and Loire. The soil is mostly poor and thin, [9:6:439] moderately fertile in the low, but heathy and unproductive in the high lands. In certain districts there are forests of oak, birch, beech, elm, and poplar. The average temperature of Corrèze is low, and the climate is damp, as several of the higher mountain summits are covered with snow for many months in the year; the summer heat in the valleys is, however, excessive. The principal rivers are the Dordogne and the Vezère, with its affluent the Corrèze. The chief productions are wheat and other cereals, hemp, flax, and wine of an inferior quality. Chestnuts are a staple article of diet with many of the people. Cattle, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and pigs are reared in considerable numbers. The mineral resources, which are little developed, include ores of iron, copper, lead, tin, and antimony, besides coal, marble, slates, clay, millstones, grind stones, granite, and porphyry. The manufactures are firearms, glass, bricks, leather, coarse woollens, paper, lace, wax candles, and nut oil. The department is divided into the arrondissements Tulle, Brive, and Ussel, containing 29 cantons and 286 communes. The chief town is Tulle. The total area is 2265 square miles, and the population in 1872 numbered 302,746.
