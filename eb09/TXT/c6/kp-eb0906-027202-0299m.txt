CONI (Italian, Cuneo), the capital of the province of the same name, is situated on an eminence at the junction of the Stura and Gesso, 46 miles south-west by rail from Turin and 86 miles north-east from Nice by the Col di Tenda. It was famous in Piedmontese warfare as a place of great strength; but in 1801, after the battle of Marengo, it was dismantled by the French. It is the seat of a bishoprâ…› (founded in 1817), and the official residence of the intendant-general of the division. The principal street and square are arcaded on both sides. The churches are built in a line with the houses, and though of very plain exterior they are ornamented internally with beautiful marbles, frescoes, and gilding. Their form is nearly square, but in the interior that of a Greek cross is produced by the arrangement of the piers. Since the railway has been opened between Sa vena and Turin, Coni has lost the Mediterranean traffic; its commerce is now confined to Turin and the neighbouring towns on the plain. In the vicinity a good wine is made called Barolo. Population, 24,300.
