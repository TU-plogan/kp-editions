CONNAUGHT, one of the four provinces of Ireland, occupying the western quarter of the island. It comprises the counties of Galway, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, and Roscommon, and contains an area of 6862 square miles, or 4,392,085 acres, of which 2,889,000 are under cultivation. The annual value of property, which, however, is based on a lower scale of prices than now obtains, is estimated at £4,188,631; and the land is divided among 5264 proprietors. An average property in this province amounts in extent to 795 acres, while in all Ireland it amounts to only 293 acres; and the average value is 6s. 9∣d. peracre, while that of all Ireland amounts to 13s. 2d. The western portion is hilly and occasionally mountainous, while the eastern part is generally level. It is well watered, and has on the greater portion of its eastern boundary the River Shannon. The River Moy is navigable from Killala to Ballina; the extensive lakes Conn, Corrib, and Mask, are navigable; and the sea coast affords many fine bays and harbours. The climate is moist and temperate. Agriculture is the main support of the population, but little progress has been made in its pursuit. The population may be considered as almost purely Celtic, and more than a third of the people speak the Irish language—a larger proportion than in the other provinces. The number of inhabitants in the province at and since the census of 1841 has been as follows :—

In early times Connaught comprised, beyond its present limits, the territory of Thomond, forming the present county of Clare, and North Breifne, the present county of Cavan. When Sir Henry Sydney, in the 16th century, divided the province into counties, he adopted the ancient boundaries, excluding North Breifne; but in 1602 the county of Clare was restored to Munster, and Connaught now comprises the counties mentioned above.
