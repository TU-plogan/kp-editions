CROTONA, or CROTON, now Cotrone, a celebrated city of Magna Graecia, at the mouth of the small river AEsarus, in the country of the Bruttii, on the western shore of the Ionian Sea. It was founded in the year 710 b.c. by a colony of Achaeans under the command of Myscellus, in accordance with a decree of the oracle at Delphi. The first well-established fact in its history is its friendship with Sybaris; and till the arrival of Pythagoras the two cities continued advancing in material prosperity and cultivating the arts of war and peace with much success. The Crotoniats regarded Hercules as their tutelary divinity, [9:6:616] and were renowned for their skill in all athletic exercises; the Sybarites were distinguished by luxury and effeminacy. The government of Crotona, oligarchical in form, had hitherto been confined to the council of 1000, who traced their descent from the Achaean founders of the city. But a secret society of 300 of the disciples of Pythagoras contrived to guide and even overawe the supreme council, till the people, who were excluded from all share in the government, expelled the Pythagoreans from the city, and established a democracy. Before this revolution, however, the Grotoniats, under the command of the celebrated athlete Milo, had marched against Sybaris, and, though opposed by an army three times their own in number, had taken it and levelled it with the ground. This event is usually dated 510 b.c. Before thirty years had elapsed, the Crotoniats themselves sustained a still more disgraceful defeat from the united forces of the Locrians and Rheggians, which, however, was not attended with such disastrous consequences to their city. During the Athenian invasion of Sicily, Crotona remained neutral; it supplied the Athenians with provisions, but refused to allow them a passage through its territory. In 389 b.c. the city fell into the hands of the elder Dionysius; but on his death in 377 it recovered its independence. Its prosperity, however, was greatly impaired by intestine feuds and the growing power of external foes. Being hard pressed by the Bruttians, Crotona sought and received assistance from the Syracusans, but had ultimately to conclude a treaty with the enemy, as it was now in danger from its own exiles. Menedemus, their general, defeated the exiles, and established a tyranny which lasted for some time. In the beginning of the 3d century b.c., the city was held for some years by Agathocles; and in the wars of the Romans with Pyrrhus it suffered so severely that more than half the area within its walls ceased to be inhabited. In the absence of Pyrrhus in Sicily, it was seized by the Roman consul Cornelius Rufinus (277 B.C.); but during the latter years of the second Punic War it was the headquarters of Hannibal for three successive winters. This completed the ruin of the town, which, though colonized a few years after from Rome, sank into obscurity, and is not again mentioned in history till the wars of Narses and Belisarius against the Goths. After that it remained subject to the Byzantine emperors till it passed into the hands of the Normans.

The medical school of Crotona was, in the days of Herodotus, and long after, the most renowned in Greece,—its proudest name being that of Alcmaeon. It is not known whether there was anything remarkable about the architecture of Crotona; but the temple of the Lacinian Juno, six miles from the city, was the most sacred and magnificent work of the kind in the whole of Magna Graecia, and contained, among other ornaments, the “Helen” of Zeuxis. One column of this great edifice still stands amid a mass of shapeless ruin.

About a mile from the site of the old Crotona is the modern town of Cotrone, in the Bay of Taranto, with a small but excellent harbour. It is the seat of a bishop, and retains the castle and walls that were erected in the time of Charles V. It surrendered to the English in 1806, but was again occupied by the French. Population, 7700.
