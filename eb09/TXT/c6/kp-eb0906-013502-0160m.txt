COLERIDGE, Sir John Taylor( 1790-1876), nephew of S. T. Coleridge, was born at Tiverton, and was educated, with Arnold and Keble, at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. In 1810 he won the Latin verse prize; in 1812 he obtained a first class in classics; and in 1813 both the English and Latin essay prizes were awarded him. He was soon after made a fellow of Exeter; in 1819 he was called to the bar, and practised for some years on the Western Circuit. In 1824, on Gifford’s retirement, he assumed the editorship of the Quarterly Review, resigning it a year afterwards in favour of Lockhart. In 1825 he published his excellent edition of Blackstone's Commentaries, and in 1832 he was made a serjeant-at-law. In 1835 he was appointed one of the judges of the King’s Bench. In 1852 his university created him a D.C.L., and in 1858 he resigned his judgeship, and was made a member of the Privy Council. In 1869, although in extreme old age, he produced his pleasant Memoir of the Rev. John Keble, M.Λ., a third edition of which was issued within a year.
