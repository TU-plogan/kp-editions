COMBINATIONS among workmen for the purpose of raising their wages, or otherwise altering the terms of their service, were for a long time expressly prohibited by statute. While the state attempted to interfere in the regulation of wages, any combination to defeat the statutory rate would naturally be looked upon with disfavour; and we need hardly be surprised to find that in 1425 a statute was actually passed, making it felony for masons to confederate together to raise their wages above the amount fixed for them by the law. The spirit of such legislation survived to times in which economical principles might be supposed to have been better understood. The Act of 39 and 40 Geo. III. c. 106 (repealing an Act of the previous session on the same subject) made illegal all contracts for obtaining advance of wages or for altering the hours of work, except contracts made between masters and men; and every workman entering into any such contract was liable to be committed to the common jail for three months on conviction before two justices of the peace. The same punishment was reserved for workmen entering into any combination for the same purpose. For the more effectual suppression of combinations among workmen, it was enacted that persons attending any meeting for the furtherance of such contracts and combinations, or persuading or intimi dating persons into attending such meetings, or collecting subscriptions for such purposes, should also be liable to be sent to jail for three months by two justices. A law so severe and so one-sided had its natural effect in promoting secret combinations and provoking acts of violence. In 1825, after an inquiry by a committee of the House of Commons, the 6 Geo. IV. c. 129 (repealing an Act on the same subject in the previous session) was passed, whereby a vast number of recited statutes relating to masters and workmen, and generally all enactments relative to combinations of workmen, were repealed. Combinations among workmen were thus relieved from the oppressive statutes specially directed against them The [9:6:182] Trade Unions Act, 1871, further enacted th¾t the purposes of any trade union shall, not by reason merely that they are in restraint of trade, be unlawful so as to render a member liable to prosecution for conspiracy or otherwise, or to render void or voidable any agreement or trust. The Act specifies certain agreements which may not be enforced in the courts, but which are still not to be regarded as unlawful. It also provides for the registration of trade unions. Their legal position under the criminal law, and the results of recent legislation on the subject, will be discussed under the heading Conspiracy. For an account of their history and economical relations see the article on Trades Unions.
