COBLENTZ (German, Coblenz), the capital of Rhenish Prussia, is pleasantly situated at the confluence of the Rhine and Moselle. From this circumstance it derived its ancient name of Confluentes, of which Coblentz is a corruption. This city is still of consequence from a military point of view, since it commands the junction of two great rivers. Its fortifications, which are very extensive, not only protect the town, but connect the works on the left bank of the Rhhιe with the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein on the other side of the river. The city is almost triangular in shape; two sides are bounded by the Rhine and Moselle, the third by strong fortifications. These are pierced by two massive gates, the Lohr and Mayence gates, with drawbridges over the fosse. The military works, which were constructed on the combined systems of Carnot and Montalembert, include no fewer than 26 forts, and form a fortified camp capable of containing 100,000 men. The Rhine is crossed here by a bridge of boats 485 yards long, and by the Iron Bridge, built for railway purposes in 1866 The Moselle is spanned by a Gothic freestone bridge of 14 arches, 1100 feet in length, erected in 1344, and also by a railway bridge. In the more ancient part of Coblentz are several buildings which possess an historical [9:6:90] interest. Prominent among th ∙se, at the point of confluence of the rivers, is the church of St Castor, built in the early Lombard style of architecture, and surmounted by four towers. The church was originally founded in 836 by Lewis the Pious, but the present edifice is considerably less ancient. It was here that the sons of Charlemagne met in 843, when they divided the empire into France, Germany, and Italy. In front of the church of St Castor stands a fountain, erected by the French in 1812, with an inscription to commemorate Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. Not long after, the Russian troops occupied Coblentz; and St Priest, their commander, added in irony these words-— “ Vu et approuvé par nous, Commandant Russe de la Ville de Coblence: Janvier 1er, 1814.” In this quarter of the town there is also the Liebfrauenkirche, a fine specimen of the old cathedral style, built in 1259; the ancient townhall; the Castle of the Electors of Treves, erected in 1280, now converted into a manufactory of japan-ware; and the family-house of the Metternichs, where Prince Metternich, the Austrian statesman, was born in 1772. The more modern part of the town has open, regular streets, and many of its public buildings are handsome. The principal of these is the Palace or Royal Castle, with one front looking towards the Rhine, the other into the Neustadt, or Great Square. It was built in 1778-86, and contains among other curiosities some fine Gobelin tapestry work. Another large edifice is the Palace of Justice, where the law courts sit, and assizes are held every three months. Coblentz has also a gymnasium (formerly a convent of Jesuits), a hospital, managed by the sisters of charity, an orphan asylum, a valuable town library, a theatre, a casino, a picture gallery, a musical institute, and a medical school. Above the Iron Bridge are Anlagen, or pleasure-grounds, much resorted to by the town’s-people. The manufactures consist chiefly of linens, cottons, japan-ware, furniture, and tobacco. Coblentz is a free port, and carries on an extensive commerce by means of the Rhine, Moselle, and Lahn. Being in the centre of the hock wine district, a large trade in this class of produce is carried on with Great Britain, Holland, and other countries. Large exports of mineral waters are also made, about one million jars of seltzer being shipped annually. Among the products of the neighbouring provinces which are exported from Coblentz are corn, iron, volcanic stones, potter’s clay, stoneware, and bark. The population is 28,000.

Coblentz was one of the military posts established by Drusus about 9 b.c. It is not unfrequently mentioned during the early centuries of the Christian era as the residence of the Frankish kings, and in 860 and 932 it was the seat of ecclesiastical councils. In 1018 it obtained the rights of a city from Henry IL, but at the same time was made subject to the Bishop of Treves, who entrusted the administration to the count palatine of the Rhine. In the following century the fief was held by the counts of Arnstein and the counts of Nassau; but it returned to the bishops in 1253. Archbishop Arnold surrounded the city with new walls in 1249-54, and, in spite of an insurrection on the part of the inhabitants, founded the citadel which still overlooks the town. As a member of the League of the Rhenish cities which took its rise in the 13th century, Coblentz attained to great prosperity; and it continued to advance till the disasters of the Thirty Years’ War occasioned a rapid decline When in 1632 the Elector Philip Christopher of 8otern surrendered Ehrenbreitstein to the French the town received an· imperial garrison, which was soon, however, expelled by the ⅛wedes, They in their turn handed the city over to the French, but the imperial forces succeeded in retaking it by storm. In 1688 it was besieged by the French Marshal Bouliers, but was successfully defended by Count Lippe. In 1786 the elector of Treves, Clemens Wenceslas, took up his residence in the town, and gave great assistance in its extension and improvement; and a few years later it became, through the invitation of his minister, Duminique one of the principal rendezvous of the French émigrés. In 1794 it was taken by the Revolution army, and, after the peace of Lunéville 1 τ t ξξ≡ ≡ de the chief town °s the Rhine and Moselle department’ In 1814 it was occupied by the Russians, and by the Congress al V ιenna it was assigned to Prussia.
