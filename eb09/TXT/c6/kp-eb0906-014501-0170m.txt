COLLIER, Jeremy (1650-1726), a learned English nonjuring divine, born at Stow-cum-Quy, Cambridgeshire, in 1650, and was educated at Caius College, Cambridge. His first appointment was to the small rectory of Ampton, near Bury St Edmunds, which, after six years, he resigned in order to proceed to London, where in 1685 he was made lecturer of Gray’s Inn. The change of Government at the Revolution, however, soon rendered the public exercise of his function impracticable. He was committed to Newgate for writing in favour of the dethroned monarch, and again on a charge of carrying on a treasonable correspondence with the enemies of the popular movement; but he was released on both occasions without trial, by the intervention of his friends. So far did he carry his scruples at this period, that he submitted to confinement rather than make a tacit acknowledgment of the jurisdiction of the court by accepting his liberty upon bail. In the two following years he continued to harass the Government by his publications; but for his boldness in granting absolution at their execution to Sir John Friend and Sir William Perkins, who had attempted the assassination of William, he was obliged to flee, and for the rest of his life continued under sentence of outlawry. When the storm had blown over he returned to London, and employed his leisure in literary works, which were less political in their tone. In 1697 appeared the first volume of his Essays on Several Moral Subjects, to which a second was added in 1705, and a third in 1709. All three series enjoyed great popularity at the time of their appearance. It was in 1798, however, that Collier produced the book by which he is best known, and for which he has been most justly praised, the famous Short View of the Immorality and Profaneness of the English Stage. Its publication involved him in a lengthened controversy with Congreve, Vanbrugh, and the other wits of the day. The book abounds in hypercriticism and in useless display of learning, neither intrinsically valuable nor conducive to the argument. Yet, in the words of Macaulay, who gives an admirable account of the discussion in bis essay on the Comic Dramatists of the Restoration, “when all deductions have been made, great merit must be allowed to the work. There is hardly any book of that time from which it would be possible to select specimens of writing so excellent and so various.” The Short View was followed by a Defence, a Second Defence, and a Farther Vindication, and in 1703 by Mr Collier's Dissuasive from the Playhouse, in a Letter to a Person of Quality. The fight lasted in all some ten years; but Collier had right on his side, and triumphed; and the reformation of the English stage, so greatly needed, may be said to date from the publication of the Short View. From 1701 to 1721 Collier was employed in the translation and publication (in six volumes folio) of Moreri’s Dictionnaire Historique, and in the compilation and issue of the two volumes folio of his own Ecclesiastical History of Great Britain. The latter work was attacked by Burnet and others, but the author showed himself as keen a controversialist as ever. Many attempts were made to shake his fidelity to the lost cause of the Stuarts, but he continued indomitable to the end. His last work was a volume of Practical Discourses, published in 1725. He died April 26, 1726.
