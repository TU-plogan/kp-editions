CONDÉ SUR NOIREAU, a town of France, in the department of Calvados, and arrondissement of Vire, is situated at the confluence of the Noireau and the Drouance, 28 miles south of Caen. The town is the seat of a civil tribunal, and its manufactures are not unimportant, comprising cotton and woollen weaving, dyeing, and tanning. The two old churches of St Sauveur and St Martin are worthy of remark, the latter possessing a very fine stained-glass window representing our Lord’s Passion. A statue has been erected here to Dumont d’ Urville, the traveller, a native of the town. Condé formerly belonged to the countship of Mortain; and it owes its origin to a fort which is said to have been constructed by the Romans. It fell into the hands of the English in 1418, but was retaken by Charles V II. in 1449. Much interest was shown by the inhabitants in the Reformation movement, and a provincial synod was held in the town in 1674. At the Revolution it lost its name of Condé, and during that period was known only as Noireau. Population of the town in 1872, 6445.
