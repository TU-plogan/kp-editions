COLET, LouiseRevoie (1808-1876), French poetess and novelist, belonged to a Provençal family, and was born at Aix. In 1834 she came to Paris; and in 1836 appeared her Fleurs du Midi, a volume of verse, of liberal tendency, which made some noise, and gained her the friendship of Teste and Cousin. It w as followed in 1839 by Penserosa, a second volume of verse; by Le Musée de Versailles, a poem crowned by the Institute; by La Jeunesse de Goethe. a one-act comedy; and by Les Coeτιrs Brises, a novel. In 1840 she published Les Funérailles de Napoleon, a poem, and La Jeunesse de Mirabeau, a reckless novel. Ιhe criticisms on her books, however, on her academical successes, and on her connection with several celebrated men about this time, exasperated her to an incredible degree; aud in 1841 Paris was diverted by her attempted reprisals on Alphonse Karr for certain notices in Les Guêpes. In 1849 she had to defend an action brought against her by the heirs of Madame Récamier, whose correspondence with Benjamin Constant she had taken it upon herself to publish iu the columns of the Presse. She was crowned five or six times by the Institute, a distinction which she owed, however, to the influence of Cousin rather than to the quality of her work. She produced a host of writings in prose and verse—novels, plays, anacreontics, didactic poems, travels, copy for a milliner’s journal, translations from Shakespeare—singularly unequal in matter and style. Only one of her books has survived— Lui: Roman Contemporain, the novel in which she told the story of her life; and that, wshatever value it may possess as an historical document, is worthless as a work of art. Madame Colet seems to have been a woman of some literary talent, wanting altogether in the quality of self-respect and the power of self-control.
