COMANA (frequently called Chryse, or Aurea, i.e., the golden, to distinguish it from Comana in Pontus), a city of Cappadocia, in a deep valley of the Anti-Taurus range, through which the River Sarus (Sihun) flows. This city was celebrated in ancient times as the place where the rites of the goddess Mã, the Greek Enyo, were celebrated with much solemnity. The service was carried on in a sumptuous temple and with great magnificence. To defray expenses, large estates had been set apart, which yielded a more than royal revenue. The city of Comana, which was a mere apanage of the temple, was governed immediately by the chief priest, who was always a member of the reigning family, and took rank next to the king. The number of persons engaged in the service of the temple, even in Strabo’s time, was upwards of 6000. Under Caracalla, Comana became a Roman colony. Its site has not been identified.
