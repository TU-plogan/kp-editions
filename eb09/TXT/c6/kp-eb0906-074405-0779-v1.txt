CYCLOPES (Kυκλo)7rες), The, in Greek mythology, worked with Vulcan at his forge in theheartof burningmountains, especially in Mount Aetna, the Lipara islands, and Lemnos. Their names, Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, indicate the noise and flash of a volcanic eruption. Finding them dangerous to his rule by their enormous strength, Kronos had confined them in the centre of the earth. Tn [9:6:745] the war between the gods and Titans they were set free by Zeus, and furnished him with his thunder and lightning. Next they appear as the builders of walls of huge stones, such as those of Mycenae, to build which they had been brought from Lycia, a volcanic country. But here they are seven in number, and seem to be of a different race. Different also are the Cyclopes of the Odyssey, in which they appear as a race living individually in caves,—with large herds of sheep and goats,—having only one eye, in the centre of the forehead, of enormous strength, and fearless of gods or men. The great strength and the one large round eye, from which their name is derived, they have in common with the volcanic Cyclopes, but as a race they seem to be connected with Neptune and the forces of the sea. Polyphemus was a son of the sea god.
