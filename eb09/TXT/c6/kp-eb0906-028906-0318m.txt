CONRADIN (1252-1268), son of the Emperor Conrad IV. and Elizabeth of Bavaria, was at the death of his father an infant some two years old. His uncle, Manfred, the illegitimate son of Frederick IL, declared himself his champion, but, having recovered the Two Sicilies, himself [9:6:290] seized the throne. Innocent IV. now called in the aid of Charles of Anjou, who defeated Manfred, and took possession of the crown. But Charles showed favour to none but his own countrymen, and at the entreaty of the Ghibelline leaders, by whom he was acknowledged as emperor, Conradin, now only sixteen, led an army into Italy. After gaining some advantages he was utterly defeated in August 1268, and soon after, being betrayed into the hands of Charles, he was unjustly tried, condemned, and executed in the market-place of Naples, with the consent of the Pope. He left his kingdom by will to Peter of Aragon. See Sicily.
