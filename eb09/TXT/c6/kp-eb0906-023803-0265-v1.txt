CONCAN, orKθNCAN,a maritime tract of Western India, situated within the limits of the Presidency of Bombay, and extending from the Portuguese settlement of Goa on the S. to the territory of Damán, belonging to the same nation, on the N. On the E. it is bounded by the Gháts, and on the W. by the Indian Ocean. This tract comprises the two British districts of Tannah and Ratnagiri, and may be estimated at 300 miles in length, with an average breadth of about 40. From the mountains on its eastern frontier, which in one place attain a height of 4700 feet, the surface, marked by a succession of irregular hilly spurs from the Gháts, slopes to the westward, where the mean elevation of the coast is not more than 100 feet above the level of the sea. Several mountain streams, but none of any magnitude, traverse the country in the same direction. One of the most striking characteristics of the climate is the violence of the monsoon rains—the mean annual fall at Mahábleshwar amounting to 239 inches. It is believed that the abundant moisture borne along from the Indian Ocean by this aerial current, becomes arrested and condensed by the mountain barrier of the Gháts, and in this manner accounts for the excessive rains which deluge the Concan. The products of this country are the same as those of [9:6:239] Malabar; and the hemp raised is said to be of a stronger quality than that grown above the Gháts. The coast has a straight general outline, but is much broken into small bays and harbours. This, with the uninterrupted view along the shore, and the land and sea breezes, which force vessels steering along the coast to be always within sight of it, rendered this country from time immemorial the seat of piracy; and so formidable had the pirates become in the 18th century, that all ships suffered which did not receive a pass from the chiefs of the pirates. The Great Mogul maintained a fleet for the express purpose of checking them, and they were frequently attacked by the Portuguese. British commerce was protected by occasional expeditions from Bombay, commencing about 1756; but the piratical system was not finally extinguished until 1812.

According to ancient traditions, this country was inhabited by a tribe of savages, till they were conquered by the Hindus, who gave it to a tribe of Brahmans; and it was held by them until it was taken possession of by the Mahometan kings of Bíjapúr. It was conquered in the 17th century by Sivájí, the founder of the Mahratta empire. Towards the close of the same century Konaji Angria established a kingdom on this coast, extending 120 miles from Tannah to Bankút, together with the inland country as far back as the mountains. The dominion of this prince and his family over a portion of the tract continued till the line became extinct, and the territory lapsed to the paramount power. The remainder of the Concan had been already incorporated with the British dominions since the fall of the Peshwa in 1818.
