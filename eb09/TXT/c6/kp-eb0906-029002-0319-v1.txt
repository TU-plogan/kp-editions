CONSALVI, or Gonsalvi, Ercole (1757-1824), cardinal and statesman, was born at Rome on the 8th of June 1757, of a noble family originally belonging to Pisa. His boyhood was sickly, and presents nothing remarkable. From the college at Urbino, he passed to the Frascati College and the religious academy at Rome, studying theology, politics, music, and literature. Entering the Pontifical court as page in 1783, he rapidly advanced, and in 1797 obtained the office of auditor of the rota, which brought him into public notice. Accused of participation in the assassination of I)uphot, he was arrested by the French on their seizure of Rome, and after a period of incarceration condemned, like so many of his brethren, to exile. On the death of Pius VI. he succeeded, in conjunction with Cardinal Maury, in securing in the conclave at Venice the election of Chiaramonti as Pius VII.; and the new Pope rewarded his devotion by appointing him secretary of state. Though from the beginning an avowed antagonist of the principles of the Revolution, Consalvi was too wise not to know that even Rome required in some degree to acknowledge their influence. He accordingly instituted various reforms, and but for the bitter opposition of the Conservative party his measures would have been more thoroughgoing than they were. He permitted laymen to hold certain public offices, under surveillance of the prelates, organized a guard fιom among the Roman nobility, decreed a plan for redeeming the base coinage, permitted the communes a certain degree of municipal liberty, and promised the liquidation of the public debt In the long debates between Rome and France about the Concordat, Cρnsalvi was the leading power on the side of the church; and he fought for the Papal privileges during his visit to Paris, with a pertinacity and spirit that won at once the hatred and respect of Napoleon. Impressed with Napoleon’s power, and anxious, if possible, to make him subservient to the designs of Rome, he strongly urged the Pope to accede to the conqueror’s request that the imperial crown should be placed on his head by the most sacred hands in Christendom. During the Pope’s absence on this mission he remained as virtual sovereign in Rome; and his regency was rendered remarkable by a great inundation, caused by the overflow of the Tiber, during which he exposed himself with heroic humanity, for the preservation of the sufferers. Not long after the return of the Pope, the amity between the Vatican and the Tuileries was again broken. Rome was full of anti-Revolutionary and anti-Napoleonic strangers from all parts of Europe. The emperor was irritated; and his ambassador, Cardinal Fesch, kept up the irritation by perpetual complaints directed more especially against Consalvi himself. “Tell Consalvi,” wrote the conqueror, still flushed with Austerlitz, “that if he loves his country he must either resign or do what I demand.” Consalvi did accordingly resign on the 17tħ June 1807, and was followed in rapid succession by Casoni, Doria, Gabrielli, and Pacca. When in 1808 Miollis entered Rome, and the temporal power of the Pope was formally abolished, he broke off all relations with the French, though several of them were his intimate friends. In 1809 he was at Paris, and, in a remarkable interview, of which he has left a graphic account in his memoirs, he received from Napoleon’s own lips what was practically an apology for the treatment he had received. With unbending dignity, however, he retained his antagonism; and shortly afterwards he was one of the thirteen cardinals who refused to recognize the marriage of Marie Louise. The result, as is well known, was a confinement at Rheims which only terminated about three years afterwards, when Napoleon had extorted what terms he pleased from the half-captive Pope at Fontainebleau. On his release Consalvi hastened to his master’s assistance; and he was soon after permitted to resume his functions under the restored pontificate at Rome. Despatched to England to meet the allied sovereigns, he was well received both by king and people; and at the Congress of Vienna he obtained the restitution of the Marches (Ancona, Treviso, and Fermo) and the Legations (Bologna, Ferrara, and Ravenna). The rest of his life was spent in the work of reorganizing the States of the Church, and bringing back the allegiance of Europe to the Fapal throne. He was practically governor of Rome; and Pius was so much under his control that “Pasquin” said the Pope would have to wait at the gates of paradise till the cardinal came from purgatory with the keys. In his foreign policy he was actuated mainly by antagonism to Austria; in his domestic policy he imitated the centralizing system of France. In all essentials a most rigid churchman, he was disposed to yield in minor matters, and obtained the praise of many Protestant visitors to Rome for his affability and liberality. Science, literature, and especially the fine arts received his most abundant patronage; the ancient buildings of Rome were excavated and preserved by his direction; chairs of natural science and archaeology were founded in the univen sity; and extensive purchases were made for the Vatican Museum, which was augmented by the addition of the [9:6:291] beautiful Braccio Nuovo, or new wing. These and the like expenses, however, were a heavy drain on the Papal treasury, and brought Consalvi into financial difficulties, from which he only got free by the imposing of unpopular taxes. On the death of Pius VII. he retired to his villa of Porto d’Anzio; and, though he afterwards accepted from the new Pope the honorary office of prefect of the college De Propaganda Fide, his political career was closed. He died on 22d of January 1824, leaving the most of his moderate fortune to the poor. A fine portrait of Consalvi by Sir T. Lawrence is preserved at Windsor, and his tomb in South Marcello is surmounted by a monument by Rinaldi.

The memoirs of his life, written with great freedom of statement and considerable force of style, have been published by Crétineau-Joly in 1864.
