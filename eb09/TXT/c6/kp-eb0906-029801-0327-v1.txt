CONSTANTINE, the capital of the French province of the same name in Algeria, situated in the richest and most populous part of the country, about 50 miles inland from the port of Philippeville, in 36° 22' 21” N. lat. and 6° 36' 36'' E. long. It holds a highly romantic position on a rocky plateau, cut off on all sides but the west by a deep but beautiful ravine, through which the Rummel finds its way. A striking contrast exists between the older and Moorish portion of the city, with its tortuous lanes and Oriental architecture, and the modern and French portion, with its rectangular streets and wide open squares, frequently bordered with trees and adorned with fountains. Of the squares the Place Nemours is the most spacious, but the Place du Palais is of more importance in the commercial and social life of the city. The public buildings may be divided into those dating from before the French conquest and later erections. Among the former are the Kasba or citadel, the mosques, the palace of the bey, and the harem of Salah; among the latter the court-house or palais de justice, the theatre, the Protestant church, and several administrative buildings. The Kasba, which occupies the northern corner of the town, is partly of Roman construction, and preserves in its more modern portions numerous remains of other Roman edifices. It is now turned into barracks, and contains within its precincts a hospital capable of accommodating 1500 patients. The mosque of Sidi el Kattani, which ranks as the finest in the city, dates only from the 18th century; but that of Souk-er Rezel, now transformed into a Christian church, and bearing the name of Notre Damae des Sept Douleurs, was built as early as 1143. The Great Mosque, or Djama-Kebir, occupies the site of what was probably an ancient Pantheon. A religious seminary, or Medersa, is maintained in connection with the Sidi el Kattani; and the French support a college and various minor educational establishments for both Arabic and European culture. There is an archaeological society, and a collection of local antiquities has been formed. The native industry of Constantine is chiefly confined to leather goods and woollen fabrics. A considerable trade is carried on with Tunis and other places on the Mediterranean, and caravans proceed regularly by Biscara and Tuggurt into the interior. The population of the city, composed of various elements, amounted in 1872 to 30,330.

Constantine, or as it was originally called, Cirta or Kirtha, from the Phoenician word or a city, was in ancient times one of the most important towns of Numidia, and the residence of the kings of the Massylii. Under Micipsa it reached the height of its prosperity, and was able to furnish an army of 10,000 cavalry and 20,000 infantry. Though it afterwards declined, it still continued to be considered an important military post, and consequently its name is frequently mentioned during successive wars. Caesar having bestowed a part of its territory on his supporter Sittius, the latter introduced a Roman settlement, and the town for a time was known as Colonia Sittianorum. I n the war of Maxentius against Alexander, the Numidian usurper, it was laid in ruins; and on its restoration in 313 by Constantine it received the name which it still retains. It was left uncaptured during the Vandal invasion of Africa, but on the conquest of the Arabians it shared the same fate as the surrounding country. During the 12th century it was still a place of considerable prosperity; and its commerce was extensive enough to attract the merchants of Pisa, Genoa, and Venice. Frequently taken and retaken by the Turks, it finally became under their dominion the seat of a bey subordinate to the dey of Algiers. In 1826 it asserted its independence of that potentate, and was governed by Hadj Ahmed, the choice of the Kabyles. In 1837 the French under Marshal Valée took possession of the place, and about ten years afterwards it was occupied as a regular colony.
