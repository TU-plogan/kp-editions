CZACKI, Tadeusz (1765-1813), a Polish statesman and author, who did much for the spread of education in Poland, was born at Poryck in Volhynia, of good family. After being educated at Cracow, he went to court and gained the favour of the king, Stanislas Augustus Poniatowski, by whom he has appointed to several high dignities. In the diet which sat from 1788 to 1792 he took a prominent place, and he was one of the advocates of the constitution which was passed in May 1791. Consequently his property was confiscated by the Czarina Catherine IL It was, however, restored by her successor Paul I.; and Alexander I. appointed him councillor. The great aim of Czackiâ€™s life was now to further education in Poland. In 1805 he opened a school at Krzemienietz, which was soon filled by about 600 pupils of both sexes, and he effected the establishment of a very large number of schools in other parts of the country. He also assisted in the foundation of the Scientific Society of Warsaw, and the Polish Commerical Society. He was twice examined by Russian commissions on a charge of having disseminated views hostile to Russia, but on both occasions he was acquitted. His chief school, that at Krzemienietz, was destroyed by the French invasion of 1812. In the February of the next year Czacki died at Dubno. A statue was raised to his memory, and placed in the library at Krzemienietz.

Among the works of Czacki, the treatise on Polish and Lithuanian law, which is full of valuable information on many subjects connected. with these countries (Warsaw, 1801, Breslau 1835), and those on the Jews, gypsies, and the statistics of Poland, deserve special mention. See the lives of Czacki by his friends Polacki and Motowski (the latter of which appeared in the supplement to the Biographie Universelle), which, however, differ considerably as to the facts of his life; that by Osinski (Krzemienietz, 1816); and the Dictionary of Learned Boles, by Chokodynicki (1823).
