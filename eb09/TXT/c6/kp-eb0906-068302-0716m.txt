CUBITT, Thomas (1788-1855), who attained distinction as a builder and capitalist, was born at Buxton, near Norwich. Few men have exhibited greater self-reliance in early life in the pursuit of a successful career. In his nineteenth year, when he was working as a journeyman carpenter, his father’s death quickened the desire to reach an independent position, and induced him to undertake a voyage to India, as captain’s joiner. On his return to London, two years after, in the possession of a small capital, he began business as a carpenter, and the growth of his establishment w as steady and rapid. He was one of the first to unite the many trades, until then more or less separate, which are now comprised in a “builder’s” business: and this amalgamation very much increased his success. One of the earlier works which gave him reputation was the London Institution, Moorfields; but it is from 1824 that the vast building operations date which identify his name with many splendid ranges of London houses, such as Tavistock, Gordon, Belgrave, and Lowndes Squares, and the district of South Belgravia. While these and similar extensive operations were in progress, a monetary panic, which proved ruinous to many, was surmounted in his case by a determined spirit and his integrity of character. He took great interest in sanitary measures, and published, for private circulation, a pamphlet on the general drainage of London, the substance of which was afterwards embodied in a letter to the Times; the plan he advocated was subsequently adopted by the conveyance of the sewage matter some distance below London. He regarded with the eye of a philanthropist the provision of open spaces in the environs of London as places of public recreation, and was one of the originators of Battersea Park, the first of the people’s parks. At a late period he received professionally the recognition of royalty, the Palace at Osborne being erected after his designs, and under his superintendence; and in the Life of the Prince Consort he is described by the Queen as one “than whom a better and kinder man did not exist.” In 1851, although he was not identified with the management of the Great Exhibition, he showed the warmest sympathy w ith its objects, and aided its projectors in many w ays, especially in the profitable investment of their surplus funds. As a capitalist he regarded as inseparable the interests of employers and employed, and he always had the elevation of his workpeople at heart. He was elected president of the Builders’ Society some time before his death, which took place at his seat of Denbies, near Dorking, in 1855.
