CONDOTTIERI. The condottieri (Italian, condottiere, captain, from condotta, conduct, condurre, to lead; Latin, conducere) were leaders of military companies, often numerous enough to constitute a large army, which they used to hire out to carry on the wars of the Italian states. The condottieri played a very important part in Italian history during the 14th and 15th centuries, especially from the middle of the 14th to the middle of the 15th. The explanation of their origin is to be sought in the special circumstances of Italy towards the close of the Middle Ages. The republics and lordships into which the country was divided were incessantly engaged in war, while the arts of peace and luxury were cultivated to such a degree that the military spirit of the people had greatly declined in comparison with the rest of Europe. In many cities, such as Milan, tyrants had begun to supersede the old republican governments, and they found it much safer to engage a mercenary army to fight their battles than to arm their own subjects. Soldiers of foreign armies, which then as afterwards not seldom overran the Italian soil, did not always return, but often stayed with their feudal leaders, and lived at free quarters. Montreal d’Albarno, a gentleman of the Provence, was the first to give a definite form to these lawless bands. A severe discipline and an elaborate organization were introduced within the company itself, while in their relations to the people the most barbaric licence was permitted. Montreal himself was put to death at Rome by Cola di Rienza, and Count Lando succeeded to the command. The Grand Company, as it was called, soon numbered about 7000 cavalry and 1500 select infantry, and was for some years the terror of Italy. They seem to have been Germans chiefly. On the conclusion (1360) of the peace of Bretigny between England and France, Sir John Hawkwood, an able general, led an army of English mercenaries, called the White Company, into Italy, which, in the service of Pisa, and afterwards of Florence, took a prominent part in the confused interminable wars of the next thirty years. Towards the end of the century the Italians began to organize armies of the same description, the first of importance being the company of St George, originated by Alberigo, count of Barbiano. The defeat of the German emperor, Rupert, by the great condottiere, Jacopo del Verme, due to the superior equipment and organization of the Italian army, taught the northern barbarians to respect the skill of the south. Shortly after, the organization of these mercenary armies was carried to the highest perfection by Sforza Attendolo, condottiere in the service of Naples, who had been a peasant of the Romagna, and by his rival Braccio di Montone in the service of Florence. The army and the renown of Sfor/a were inherited by his son Francesco Sforza, who married a natural daughter of one of the Visconti of Milan, conducted the wars of that city against Venice, and eventually became duke of Milan (1450), which his family continued to rule for some generations. Less fortunate was another great condottiere, Carmagnola, who first served one of the Visconti, and then conducted the wars of Venice against, his former masters, but at last awoke the suspicion of the Venetian oligarchy, and was put to death before the palace of St Mark (1432). Towards the end of the 15th century, when the large cities had gradually swallowed up the small states, and Italy itself was drawn into the general current of European politics, and became the battle-field of powerful armies,—French, Spanish, and German,—the condottieri disappeared. The soldiers of the condottieri were almost entirely cavalry, and were clad in armour from head to foot. Not being connected with the people among whom they fought by any of the ordinary ties of humanity, and given up to all the licence of the worst profession in the world, they were a dreadful scourge wherever they went.

They were always ready to change sides at the prospect of higher pay. And as they were connected with each other by the interest of a common profession, and the possibility that the enemy of to-day might be the friend and fellowsoldier of to-morrow, their battles were often as bloodless as they were theatrical. Splendidly equipped armies of several thousand strong were known to fight for several hours with hardly the loss of a man. (See Symonds’s Renaissance in Italy: the Age of the Despots, ch. ii.)
