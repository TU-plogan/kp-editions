COHOES, one of the most important manufacturing centres in the United States, is situated in Albany County, in the State of New York, at the confluence of the Mohawk with the Hudson, just below the famous Cohoes fall on the former river, to which it is indebted for its prosperity. It contains seven churches and twenty-two public schools, the most remarkable of the churches being the Roman Catholic St Bernard’s and the Episcopal St John’s. The manufacturing establishments comprise six cotton mills with 4000 looms, eighteen knitting mills, a rolling mill, a pin factory, a knitting-needle factory, two foundries, three machine shops, a paper-mill, and a bedstead factory. In 1870 there were produced 54,342,000 yards of cloth, 33,600,000 knitting-needles, and 350,000 packages of pins; while the turn-out of hosiery formed a third of the whole amount manufactured in the United States. The whole water-power of the river for some distance both above and below the falls is the property of the Cohoes Company instituted in 1826; and the various manufactories obtain their share at a fixed annual charge for each horse-power. The supply is regulated by a dam erected above the falls in 1865, and by a system of five canals. Cohoes owes its rise to the incorporation of the Cohoes Manufacturing Company in 1811. It obtained the rank of a village in 1848 and that of a city in 1869. Its population in 1850 was 4229; in 1860, 8800; and in 1870, 15,357. A large number of French Canadians are to be found among the operatives.
