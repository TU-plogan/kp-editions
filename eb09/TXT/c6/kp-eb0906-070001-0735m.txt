CUMBERLAND, a city of the United States, capital of Alleghany county, Maryland, on the north bank of the Potomac river, 179 miles west of Baltimore. It contains a court-house, a county prison, a market-house, and several handsome churches; aud as the western terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and the seat of a railway junction, it enjoys excellent opportunities for trade. There are flour-mills and iron-furnaces in the neighbourhood; and an extensive factory for the manufacture of steel rails is maintained by the Baltimore and Ohio railway company. A few miles to the west is the commencement of the great Cumberland coal region. Population in 1870, 8056.
