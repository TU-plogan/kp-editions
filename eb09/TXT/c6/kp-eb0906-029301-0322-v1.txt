CONSOLS, an abbreviation of Consolidated Annuities, had their origin in 1751, and now form the larger portion of the funded debt of the United Kingdom. In the progress of the national debt it was deemed expedient, on grounds which have been much questioned, instead of borrowing at various rates of interest, according to the state of the market or the need and credit of the Government, to offer a fixed rate of interest, usually three or three and a half per cent., and as the market required to give the lenders an advantage in the principal funded. Thus subscribers of £100 would sometimes receive £150 of three percent, stock. In 1815, at the close of the French wars, a large loan was raised at as much as £174 three per cent, and £10 four per cent, stock for £100. Thelow rate of interest was thus purely nominal, while the principal of the debt was increased beyond all due proportion. This practice began in the reign of George IL, when some portions of the debt on which the interest had been successfully reduced were consolidated into three per cent, annuities, and consols, as the annuities were called, and other stocks of nominally low interest, rapidly increased under the same practice during the great wars. In times of peace, when the rate of money has enabled portions of the debt at a higher interest to be commuted into stock of lower interest, it has usually been into consols that the conversion has been effected. Temporary deficits of the revenue have been covered by an issue of consols; exchequer bills when funded have taken the same form, though not constantly or exclusively; and some loans of the Government in recent times for special purposes, such as the relief of the Irish famine and the expenditure in the Crimean war, have been wholly or partly raised in consols. The consequence has been to give this stock a pre-eminence in the amount of the funded debt. It appears from a recent parliamentary return than of £773,313,229 of funded debt of the United Kingdom £398,147,075 consisted of consols, £107,227,854 of three percent, reduced annuities, and £225,256,099 of new threes. The funds of the savings’ banks have been applied to the absorption of reduced annuities and new threes in Liger proportion than of consols. The characteristics of this large portion of the debt, though it would seem almost indistinguishable from the three per cent, reduced, which originated about the same period as the consolidated threes, are that the inteιest has never varied; no attempt has been made to convert it to a lower interest or into another form of stock; and not only from its larger amount than other stock is it most convenient to dealers, but from the great number and variety of its holders it is believed to express with the greatest nicety the state of monetary affairs. The price of consols, however, does not in ordinary times vary much. It has a tendency, indeed, to rise when all other securities are most shaken. In periods of panic and extreme pressure for money, it has gone down for a few days between 80 and 90; its most customary range may be said to be 95 to 97; and it has occasionally touched par. The legal provisions erecting consols are found in several clauses of 25 George II. c. 27, and the regulations for their redemption in section 24 of the same Act.
