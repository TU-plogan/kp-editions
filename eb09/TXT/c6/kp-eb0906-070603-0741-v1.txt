CUMMING, Roualeyn Gordon, Scottish traveller and sportsman, generally known as “the Lion Hunter,” was born March 15, 1820. He was the second son of Sir William G. Gordon Cumming, baronet, of Altyre and Gordonstown, North Britain. In his early years a strong love for nature in her wildest forms and a passion for sport displayed themselves in him, at once foreshadowing and determining his future career. He was educated at Eton, and at the age of eighteen passed the examination at Addiscombe and entered the Indian army (Madras Light Cavalry). In consequence of the injurious effects of the climate on his health he did not remain long in India, but retired from the service and returned to Scotland. During his stay, however, he had laid the foundation of his large and interesting collection of hunting trophies and specimens of natural history. After indulging for a time in his favourite pursuits in his native land, he resolved to visit the prairies and mountain solitudes of the Far West. This project, however, was relinquished in favour of a visit to South Africa. He joined the Cape Riflemen, and in 1843 began his five years’ hunter’s life, the story of which is told in his well-known work, published in 1850. He did not remain long in the army; but for the sake of absolute freedom sold out and set forth to explore the unknown regions of interior Africa. His waggon was his only home; and even this he often quitted for the sake of bolder ventures either alone or attended only by savages. His collection, the South African Museum, was exhibited in London in 1851, at the time of the Great Exhibition, and was illustrated by a lecture delivered by the famous hunter himself. The museum was afterwards exhibited in various parts of the country. During the last eight years of his life he resided at Fort Augustus, where his collection attracted many visitors. He died there, March 24, 1866.
