COMO, a city of Italy, capital of the province of its ow n name, at the south-west corner of the Lake of Como, in a beautiful valley surrounded by richly-clad mountains. It lies in 45° 48' 26" N. lat. and 9° 4' 45" E. long., and is distant twenty-eight miles by rail from Milan. The city proper is still surrounded by its ancient walls and towers: but two pretty extensive suburbs, known as Vico and St Agostino, have grown up outside—the former containing a large number of fine villas, and the latter devoted specially to manufacturing purposes. The principal buildings are the cathedral, the broletto or town hall, the churches of St Fedele and St Abondio, the Palazzo Giovio, with its library and collection of antiquities, the Gallio College, and the theatre. The cathedral, erected by the voluntary contributions of the citizens, is a structure of various dates and styles of architecture,—the earliest portions being by Lorenzo de’ Spaziof the end of the 14th century, while the cupola is the work of Guvara, an architect of the first half of the 18th. The most interesting, perhaps, of the monuments which it preserves, is that of Benedetto Giovio, an early historian of the city. The broletto dates from 1215, and is built of alternate courses of black and white marble; but of still greater value as an artistic effort is the church of St Abondio, a small but exquisite structure of the 11th century, built, it would seem, in the lower portions of Roman remains, and remarkable for an “apse of extraordinary height and richness rising between two tall campaniles.” There are extensive factories in Como for the spinning and weaving of silk; it also manufactures woollens, cotton, and soap; and there are iron-works in the immediate vicinity. To its position on the lake and its command of the Splügen and St Gotthard lines of communication, it is indebted for a considerable trade by way [9:6:220] of transit and distribution. About a mile to the south of the town is the tower of Baradello, famous as the place where the Torriani of Milan were confined in cages by the Visconti party, over whom they had previously tyrannized. The population of Como is 24,350.

Como is readily identified with the ancient Comum, a city of Gallic origin, situated within the territory of the Galli Insubres. Though from an early period a flourishing and important centre, it never played a very conspicuous part in ancient history. Soon after the beginning of the 2d century b.c., the people of Comum joined the Insubres in an attack on the Romans; but they were defeated, and their city fell into the hands of the conquerors, and became a Roman colony. The first colonists, however, were unable to maintain themselves against the inroads of the Rhaetian Gauls; and additional settlers were sent down from time to time. Julius Caesar, in particular, introduced 5000, of whom a tenth were Greeks; and the colony assumed for a short time the name of Novum Comum. On the accession of Caesar to supreme power, Comum obtained the complete right of citizenship; but though it was at this time at the height of its prosperity, it never took rank higher than a municipal town. In the early part of the Middle Ages it formed for a time, like many of the towns of Italy, an independent republic; but after a considerable struggle it had to submit to Milan. Its deliverance was effected in 1158 by Frederick I. of Germany, to whom its citizens had appealed; but in the 15th century it again succumbed before the Milanese nobles. In 1520 it was captured by Charles V. During the Roman period the Pliny family were connected with the city; and in more modern times it numbers among its celebrities Paulus Jovius, Piazzi the astronomer, and Volta the electrician.
