CONFIRMATION, an ecclesiastical term denoting the laying on of hands, in the admission of baptized persons to the enjoyment of full Christian privileges. The antiquity of this ceremony is, by all the older writers, carried as high as the apostles, and founded upon their example and practice. In the primitive church the ceremony was performed immediately after baptism, if the bishop were present at the solemnity. Among the Greeks, and throughout the East, it still accompanies baptism; but th© Roman Catholics make it a distinct and independent sacrament. Seven years is the stated but not the uniform age for confirmation. The view put forth in the English prayer-book is, that the person confirmed releases his godfather and godmother, by taking upon himself the baptismal vows in their place,—an aspect of the matter not apparently recognized in the ancient church, which regarded it almost exclusively as a means of grace and a preparation for the reception of the Holy Communion. This ordinance is usually reserved for the bishop only. It has, however, always been a moot point, whether he may not· delegate a presbyter to perform it for him. Such delega tion is not uncommon in the Eastern Churches, but is practically unknown in the West. The Calvinists (in common with most non-episcopal communities) have always rejected confirmation.
