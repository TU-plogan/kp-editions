COMANA, an ancient city of Pontus in Asia Minor, said to have been colonized from Comana in Cappadocia. It stood on the River Iris (or Tocat-su), not far from its source, and from its central position was a favourite emporium of the Armenian and other merchants. The moon-goddess was worshipped in the city with a pomp and ceremony in all respects analogous to those employed iu the Cappadocian city. ∙ Large multitudes were attracted to the place by the great annual processions, and the permanent population was increased by the influx of devotees. The slaves attached to the temple alone numbered not less than. 6000. Remains of Comana are still to be seen near a village called Gumenek on the Tocat-su, seven miles from the city of Tocat. “They consist,” says Van Lennep, “of a low hill upon which are scattered fragments of brick and hewn-stone, with here and there the remains of a wall or a partly fallen vault.” The bridge that crosses the river at the spot is largely composed of fragments of ancient structures, and several sepulchral inscriptions can be deciphered on the blocks beneath the arches. Still nearer the modern village of Gumenek than these ruins lies a large boulder of marble iu which tombs or cells have been excavated. One of these is reputed to have been the abode of Chrysostom during his first exile from Constantinople.
