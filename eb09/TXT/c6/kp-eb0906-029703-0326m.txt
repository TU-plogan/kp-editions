CONSTANT DE REBECQUE, Henri Benjamin, an eminent French statesman and publicist, was born at Lausanne, 25th October 1757, and died at Paris 10th December 1830. His family was French, and had taken refuge in Switzerland during the religious persecutions. Till the age of thirteen he lived in his father’s house at Lausanne; he afterwards studied at Oxford, Erlangen, and Edinburgh successively. It was in these foreign studies that he made a beginning in the cosmopolitan culture which afterwards characterized him; in England especially he learned to admire constitutional government, and made the acquaintance of such men as Erskine and Mackintosh. Shortly before the Revolution he went to Paris, and became acquainted with some of the leading liberal spirits of that city, where, after further travels, he finally settled in 1795. He attached himself to the moderate republican party, and supported it through many changes of fortune, both in the Assemblies and by writing, under the Directory and the Consulate, till 1802, when he was expelled from the Tribunate by Napoleon. The circle to which he belonged again provoked the anger of the First Consul by its private opposition to the Government, whereupon Constant, with his celebrated friend Madame de Staël, found it advi⅛ able to retire from France. Thus arrested in his political career he turned to literature, and proceeded to Weimar, where he enjoyed the acquaintance of Goethe and Schiller, translated Wallenstein, and wrote the romance of Adolphe. He did not return to France till the overthrow of Napoleon in 1814. Attracted by the prospect of the restoration of constitutional government he supported the Bourbons; and, apparently for a similar reason, he adhered to Napoleon during the Hundred Days. After the violence of the second Bourbon restoration had subsided Constant reappeared on the political scene to maintain the principles of constitutionalism. By all legal means, in the journals aud in the Chambers, as well as by political tractates and pamphlets, under Louis XVIII. and Charles X.he combated, not without success, the reactionary measures of the government. Ill-health detained him in the country during the revolution of July (1830); but at the urgent request of Lafayette he returned to the capital, and concurred in the elevation to the vacant throne of Louis Philippe. Notwithstanding his feeble health Constant continued to support the new Government, but an unsuccessful candidature for a seat in the Academy so aggravated his previous complaint, that he died a few months after the triumph of the principles to which he had consecrated his life. Adverse circumstances had prevented the champion of representative government from playing a first part in the history of France, assuming that he had the faculty to do so. His voice was dry, his manner deficient in ease and grace, and he did not excel in improvising a reply; but his intellect was clear and powerful, his culture wide, and his industry remarkable.

The greater part of his political tractates have been collected by himself under the title of Cours de Politique Constitutionelle. J. P. Pagès collected the speeches delivered at the Chamber of Deputies, 3 vols, in 8vo. (1832— 1833). His great philosophical work was De la religion considérée dåns sa source, ses formes, et ses développements.
[9:6:298]

The most important of his purely literary productions are the novels, Adolphe and Cecile, and the translation of Wallenstein. His philosophical work on religion, which occupied him more or less almost all his life, is an attempt to trace the successive transformations of the religious sentiment, his conclusion being that, while the religious instinct is imperishable, the doctrinal and ceremonial forms by which it expresses itself are transitory. A quotation or two will suffice to indicate his attitude towards the liberalism of the 18th century. “Christianity has introduced moral and political liberty into the world.” “If Christianity has been often despised, it is because men have not understood it. Lucian was incapable of understanding Homer; Voltaire has never understood the Bible.”
