COOK’S ISLANDS, or the Hervey Archipelago, a considerable cluster of islands in the South Pacific, lying between the Friendly Islands and the Society Islands, in 160° W. long, and about 20° S. lat. They were discovered by Captain Cook in 1777, and in 1823 became the scene of the remarkable missionary labours of John Williams. The most important members of the group, which has a total area of about 300 square miles, are Mangeia, Raratonga, Aitutake, and Atiu. They are almost destitute of drinking water; but abound in cocoa-palms, bread-fruit trees, and plantains. The inhabitants belong to the Malay race, and display great industry and skill in various manufactures. Their houses are well built, and have a pleasant appearance with their white walls of coral lime. The population of Raratonga is estimated at 2000, of Mangeia at 2300, of Aitutake at 1550, and of Atiu at 1200 or 1500.
