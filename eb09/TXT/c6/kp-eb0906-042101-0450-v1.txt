CORNEILLE, Thomas (1625-1709), was nearly twenty years younger than his brother, the day of his birth being August 20, 1625. Hisskill in verse-making seems to have shown itself early, as at the age of fifteen he composed a piece in Latin which was represented by his fellow pupils at the Jesuits’College of Rouen. He soon followed'his brother’s steps, and his first piece, Les Engagements du Hasard, was acted in 1647. From this time forward he produced a constant series of plays, sometimes in collaboration, offener alone. At his brother’s death he succeeded to his vacant chair in the Academy. He then turned his attention to philology, producing a new edition of the Remarques of Vaugelas in 16S7, and in 1694 a dictionary intended to supplement that of the Academy. A complete translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses (he had published six books with the Heroic Epistles some years previously) followed in 1697. In 1704 he lost his sight and was constituted a “veteran,” a dignity which preserved to him the privileges, while it exempted him from the duties, of an Academician. But he did not allow his misfortune to put a stop to his work, and soon produced a large Geographical and Historical Dictionary in 3 vols, folio. This was his last labour. He died on the 8th of December 1709, aged eighty-four. It has been the custom to speak of Thomas Corneille as of one who, but for the name he b >re, would merit no notice. This is by no means the case; on the contrary, he is rather to be commiserated for his connection with a brother who outshone him as he would have outshone almost any one. Of his forty-two plays (this is the utmost number assigned to him) the last edition of his complete works contains only thirty-two, but he wrote several in conjunction with other authors. Two are usually reprinted at the end of his brother’s selected works. These are Ariane and the Comte d , Essex, in the former of which Rachel attained success. But of Laodice, Camma, Stilico, and some other pieces, Pierre Corneille himself said that “he wiched he had written them,” and he was not wont to speak lightly. Camma especially deserves notice. Thomas Corneille is in many ways remarkable in the literary history of his time. His Timocrate had the longest run recorded of any play in the century. FυrZα Dévineresse he and his coadjutor De Visé received above 6000 livres, the largest sum known to have been thus paid. Lastly, one of his pieces (Le Baron des Fondrières) contests the honour of being the first which was hissed off the stage. (g. sa.)
