+====================================================================+


CONSTANTINE PAVLOVICH (1779-1831), second son of the Czar Paul I. of Russia, was born at St Petersburg on the 8th May 1779. His name was chosen by his grandmother, the Empress Catherine, on account, it was believed, of the tradition according to which an emperor Constantine was to reign at Constantinople. At the age of seventeen the prince was married to the Princess Juliana of Saxe-Coburg, but after four years a separation took place. In all affairs connected with the army Constantine took the intensest interest. In 1799 he served in Italy, and he gained distinction at the battle of Austerlitz (1805) by the admirable order in which he retreated. He also served throughout the rest of the war with France, but never held supreme command. In the end of 1815 he was appointed generalissimo of the army of Poland. His rule was marked by an unreasonable severity, which produced deep and general discontent; buthe introduced the strictest discipline. Though not nominally head of the Government, Constantine’s influence was very considerable; and it was all employed in support of arbitrary principles. He abolished the liberty of the press, and any literary man or student who expressed any opinion obnoxious to him was immediately thrown into prison. On the other hand he did much to carry out many material improvements. In 1820, having fallen in love with a Polish lady, he obtained through the influence of the emperor, his brother, a decree of the Holy Synod permitting him to marry the lady; and iu return ho signed a paper resigning all claim to the succession to the throne. On the death of the Czar Alexander in December 1825, Nicholas, Constantine’s younger brother, and after him heir to the throne, refused to allow himself to be crowned; but Constantine remained true to his promise, and, though a conspiracy of the officers of the army in favour of a constitution took place, and the conspirators proclaimed Constantine czar, he persisted in supporting his brother, at whose coronation he appeared to take the oath of homage. After this Constantine’s power in Poland became greater than before; his system of espionage and arbitrary government was more harshly put in force, and arrests without any specified charge became more common. At length in 1830, that year of revolutions, the general hatred of Russia burst into a rebellion. Some of the conspirators entered the prince’s palace at Warsaw; but, the Polish guard remaining faithful, he escaped. He was, however, forced to release all Polish political prisoners, and to declare his intention of not calling in the Russian army to attack Poland. His Polish guard now requested liberty to rejoin the rest of the army. After granting permission, he withdrew it, and the guard deserted him. He was, nevertheless, allowed to reach the frontier in safety. In the consequent war Constantine took no important part, and after a time even the inferior command which he held was taken from him. The czar refused to allow him to live near St Petersburg, and the place of his residence was fixed at the little town of Bialystok, on the border line of Poland and Lithuania. He died on the 27th June of the following year (1831).
