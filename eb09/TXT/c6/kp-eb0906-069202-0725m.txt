CUENCA, an inland town of the Andes of Ecuador, S. America, about 190 miles S. of Quito and 60 miles S.E. of the port of Guayaquil. It stands on a plain at an elevation of about 8640 feet above the sea, near the hill of Farqui, chosen by the French astronomers as their meridian in 1742. It is a cathedral city, and contains several monasteries, besides a college and other educational institutions. Cuenca has an extensive trade in cheese, oats, grain, and other agricultural produce. The population, which is estimated at 25,000, is in great part Indian. In the redivision of the republic into 11 provinces, which took place in 1875, the former province of Cuenca ceased to bear that name.
