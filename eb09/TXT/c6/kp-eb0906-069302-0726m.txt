CULDEES. On no subject connected with the early ecclesiastical history of the British Islands has there been more discussion than on that of the Culdees. Their very name has furnished matter for dissertations, and their doctrines, mode of life, and peculiar institutions have been the fruitful source of controversy. There is still room for doubt as to details, but in all-important points the truth has been sufficiently ascertained by the learned Scottish and Irish antiquaries who have devoted their attention to the question. The discussion may now be held as practically settled in Britain, though Continental scholars of some mark are still disposed to carry it on.

It is of no consequence whether the wordCuldee is of Latin or Celtic origin. The name is equally significant and of similar meaning in both languages. It is not precisely ascertained at what time that name was first used. It was unknown to Bede and the biographers of St Columba, but seems to have been established early in the 10th century as the title of an order of ecclesiastics possessing numerous establishments in Scotland and Ireland, and a very few also in England and Wales. The Culdees resided in monasteries, but were not tied down by monastic rules so strict as those of the followers of Columba or Columbanus, or of the Benedictine order and its various branches. Their institute bore some resemblance to the rule of the canons-regular of St Augustine, but still more to that of the secular canons so well known in the history of England during the 10th and 11th centuries. They were not united in one great community like the Columbites and Cistercians, or the orders of the Mendicant Friars, but resided in their separate monasteries or colleges, each of which was governed by its abbot, and was practically independent of the others. The Scottish monasteries are the best known, and it is in connection with them that the history of the order is most important. Their chief houses in that country were St Andrews, which numbered among its superiors King Constantine, who in earlier years had fought against the English sovereign Athelstan at Brunanburh; Dunkeld, of which Crinan, grandfather of Malcolm Canmore, was one of the lay abbots; Lochleven, famous as giving us the oldest of Scottish library catalogues; and Abernethy and Brechin, remembered chiefly in connection with their round towers.

It was long fondly imagined by Protestant writers that the religious belief and worship of the Culdees supplied complete evidence of primitive truth having been preserved free from Roman corruptions in one remote comer of Western Europe. It is now certain that this opinion is entirely opposed to historical evidence. In doctrine, ritual, and government there was no difference between the Culdees and the monastic communities in the Latin Church, except that the former, as was to be expected in a remote and uncivilized country distracted by repeated invasions of the Northmen, and by almost uninterrupted civil dissensions, were more superstitious and corrupt than their brethren on the Continent. In ecclesiastical discipline and morals there was the same inferiority. The “pure Culdees” are familiar in poetry and legend, but are unknown to history. At no time distinguished above their fellows for learning or piety, they gradually became still more remiss. The chief endowments of their monasteries were seized by nobles, who called themselves abbots, but were neither ecclesiastics nor discharged any ecclesiastical functions, and who transmitted their titles and estates to their families in hereditary descent. In one respect these nobles were better than the corresponding class who, as priors of St Andrews and abbots of Arbroath and Paisley, or the like, fought on either side in the civil wars of the 16th century;—they gave up a portion of their revenues to ecclesiastics, who, under the name of priors, discharged the spiritual functions of superiors of the monasteries.

Such a system naturally tended to become more corrupt as time went on. We need not believe all that is told to the prejudice of the Culdees by the chroniclers of a later age; but it is certain that the changes introduced into the Scottish Church by the influence of Queen Margaret and her son King David effected a great and beneficial revolution. The Culdees in general conformed to the stricter discipline enforced by these sovereigns. The lay abbots had to resign their titles if not their estates; the chief houses of the old rule reappeared as Benedictine and Augustinian monasteries; and, in one case at least, that of Brechin, the Culdees became for a time the chapter of the new cathedral The last appearance of the Culdees in Scottish history is in connection with the unsuccessful attempts of the prior and brethren of the order at St Andrews, in the beginning of the 14th century, to maintain their ancient privilege of assisting at the election of a bishop of the primatial see.

The best and fallest account of the Culdees is to be found in Dean Reeves’s Culdees of the British Islands as they appear in History, with an Appendix of Evidences, Dublin, 1864
