CUTCH GUNDAVA, a district in the province of Baluchistan, situated at the bottom of the mountains lying south-east of Khelat, between 27° 40' and 29° 50' N. lat. and 67° 20' and 69° 17' E. long. It is about 150 miles in length, and measures nearly an equal distance in its greatest breadth. The Hala range of mountains extends along its western frontier, and forms the eastern wall or face of the elevated table-land of central Baluchistan. Through this range are two great passes,—the celebrated Bolan Pass in the north leading in a north-westerly direction, and the Mula Pass, which, more to the south, takes an extensive circuit, the two extremities pointing towards the north, and the convexity towards the south. The soil is rich, black, and loamy, and produces every spices of grain, as also cotton, indigo, madder, and other commodities. The rains are heavy in June, July, and August; it rains also, but not so heavily, in the spring months. The climate during the summer is unhealthy, owing to the simoom or pestilential wind which blows at that time, causing the death of many of the inhabitants. Great quantities of grain are exported from this district to the seaports of Kurrachee and Son-miani. Cutch Gundava is the most populous part of Baluchistan, and constitutes the most valuable portion of the dominions of the Khan of Kbelat, who during winter resides at the chief town.
