CONWAY, or Aberconway, a town of Carnarvonshire, in North Wales, at the mouth of the Conway, four miles south of Llandudno and forty-five miles west of Chester by railway. It is situated on the western bank of the river, and is inclosed by a lofty wall, which approaches the form of a triangle, and is a mile in circumference. The style of this ancient and highly interesting wall is Saracenic; it is fenced with twenty-one round towers, now somewhat dilapidated, and entered by three principal gateways with two strong towers. The south-eastern angle is occupied by the castle, one of the noblest of the old fortresses in England. It was built in 1284 by Edward I. to secure his possession of North Wales, and was the residence of Richard II. in 1389. During the war of the Commonwealth it was held for Charles I. by Archbishop Williams, but was taken by General Mytton in 1646. In the following reign it was dismantled by its new proprietor Earl Conway, and remains a ruin. The building is oblong in form; it is strengthened with eight massive drum towers; and part of the interior is occupied by a great hall, known as Llewelyn’s, 130 feet long. The town contains some curious old houses of the Elizabethan period, a town-hall where the petty sessions are held, and St Mary’s Church. The Parliamentary borough of Conway (which with Carnarvon and four others returns in conjunction a member to Parliament) extends beyond the walls of the town, and over to the right bank of the river, occupying a total area of 3312 acres. Population of town, 1862; of borough, 2620.
