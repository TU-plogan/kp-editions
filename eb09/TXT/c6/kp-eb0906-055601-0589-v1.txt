CREAM OF TARTAR, acid potassium tartrate,or “bitartrate of potash,” HKC 4 O 6 H 4 , is obtained from argol or crude tartar, the crust or deposit formed by wines in bottles and casks in which they are undergoing fermentation. Red are usually richer in argol than white wines. A ton of grapes yields, according to the nature of the fruit, quantities varying between 1 and 2 lb of argol, of which, in good samples, an average of about 83 per cent, is cream of tartar. French red wines examined by Μ. Fauré contained from O6664 to *19728 per cent, by weight of this salt, and white wines from - 09172 to ’ 15208 per cent.; Μ. Jacob found from ’ 7 to l , 201 grammes per litre in the wines of Tonnerre. The manufacture of cream of tartar is conducted as follows. Ground granulated argol is wetted and then dissolved in water at a temperature of 100° C.; after two or three days, during which insoluble impurities subside, the clear liquid is drawn off into earthen vessels. The crystals it deposits are re-dissolved in boiling water holding finely comminuted pipe-clay and animal-charcoal in suspension. The solution after standing till a thin film of crystals appears on its surface is run into conical coolers, the sides of which become in eight or nine days coated with fine clear crystals, colouring matters having been precipitated by the clay and charcoal. The crystals are then bleached and dried by exposure to sunlight and air. In Venice tho impurities of the crude tartar are separated by repeated crystallizations, and finally by adding white of egg and wood-ashes to the boiling solution, and removing the scum formed. The name “cream of tartar” was originally given to the crust of minute pure white crystals formed on the surface of cooling solutions. Cream of tartar is a colourless, transparent salt, crystallizing in four-sided prisms belonging to the trimetric system, and having a specific gravity of about 1 - 96. It is precipitated when a potassium salt is added to a solution of free tartaric acid. It is soluble in alkalies, alkaline carbonates, and mineral acids, but insoluble in acetic acid and alcohol. Its insolubility in the last mentioned is the cause of its separation from wines as they mature. One part by weight of the salt is soluble at 0° C. in about 416 (Chancel), and at 100° C. in about fifteen parts of water. The solution has an acid reaction, and dissolves many metallic oxides, furnishing double tartrates. When heated, cream of tartar is decomposed, with the formation of potassium carbonate (the sal- fixuιn tartari of the older chemists) and carbon, inflammable gases possessing an odour of burnt bread being at the same time evolved. Potassium carbonate is produced also when the salt is kept moist or in solution for some years. Cream of tartar— potassae tariras acida — is used in medicine as a refrigerant, diuretic, and mild purgative; in dyeing as a mordant for wool; in the manufacture of tartaric acid and potassium carbonate; and with powdered chalk and alum for cleaning silver. Rodιelle salt, KNaC 4 O 0 H 4 , is made by neutralizing cream of tartar with sodium carbonate; tartar emetic, K(SbO)C 4 O 6 H 4 , by boiling it with three-fourths of its weight of antimony trioxide, filtering the hot solution, and crystallizing. Black flux, the result of the incineration of tartar is much employed in assaying, and may be prepared by deflagrating two or three parts of the salt with one of nitre; for white flux equal weights of the two salts are required. Tartars, even those intended for the manufacture of tartaric acid, should be free from any considerable quantity of calcium tartrate, as the moisture of the air soon converts that salt into calcium carbonate. The substances most used to adulterate cream of tartar are calcium chloride and sulphate, and the chloride and acid sulphate of potassium.
