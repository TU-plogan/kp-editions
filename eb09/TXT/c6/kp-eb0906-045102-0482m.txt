COSIELLO, Dudley (1803-1865), a journalist, novelist, and miscellaneous writer, was born in Ireland in 1803. He was the son of Colonel J. F. Costello, and choosing his father’s profession, was educated at Sandhurst College, and served for a short time with his regiment in Canada and the West Indies. His literary and artistic tastes led him to quit the army, and he then passed some years (1822-1831) at Paris. During this period he was introduced to Baron Cuvier, and was employed by him as draughtsman in the preparation of his work on comparative anatomy. He next occupied himself in copying illuminated manuscripts in the Bibliothèque Royale; and to him and his sister belongs the merit of being the first to draw general attention to the beautiful forgotten art, and of thus leading to its revival. About 1832 Costello became foreign correspondent to the Morning Herald, and from this time he was regularly occupied as journalist and contributor to periodical literature. During the last twenty years of his life he held the post of sub-editor of the Examiner. He wrote A Tour through the Valley of the Meuse (1845), and Italy, from the Alps to the Tiber (1861). Among his novels are Stories from a Screen (1855), The Millionaire (1858), Faint Heart never won Fair Lady (1859), and Holidays with Hobgoblins (1860). He died in London, September 30, 1865. A few years before his death a pension of £100 per annum was conferred on him.
