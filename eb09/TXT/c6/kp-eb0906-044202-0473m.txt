CORTONA, a city of Italy, in the province of Arezzo, and about thirteen miles south of the city of that name, occupying the summit and slope of a steep hill that, from a height of 2000 feet above the sea, overlooks the fertile valley of the Chiana or Clanis. Its ancient fortifications, which are well preserved in almost their total [9:6:443] circuit, present not only portions of Roman and mediaeval works, but magnificent specimens of the so-called Cyclopean architecture. The cathedral, a building of the 15 th century, but restored by Galilei in the 18th, contains a number of paintings by Luca Signorelli and Pietro Berettini, who were both natives of the town; the tomb of John Baptist Tommasi, the last grand-master of the Order of Malta; and a large sarcophagus, adorned with bas-reliefs of the Lapithae and Centaurs, in which, according to the fanciful hypothesis of the local antiquaries, were the remains of the Consul Flaminius, who perished in the battle of Lake Thrasymene against the Carthaginian invader. Among the other churches, which are almost all in possession of paintings of interest to connoisseurs, the most important is Santa Margherita, a fine building of the 13th century by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, which occupies the top of the hill and is embosomed in cypress trees. The Accadentia, Etrusca, founded by Ridolfino Venuti in 1726, has a museum in the palazzo ρretorio, which numbers amongst its various treasures a bronze candelabrum of sixteen lights, ranked among the finest specimens of Etruscan art. In the same building is preserved the Bonbucci Library, which contains a fine IMS. of Dante and a curious unpublished work called the Notti Coritane, or Nights of Cortona. Outside of the town is an Etruscan tomb of some architectural interest, known as the Grotto of Pythagoras. The population of the commune is upwards of 26,000; that of the city is only 3973.

The origin of Cortona, or Corythus, as it is called by Virgil, is lost in remote antiquity; and little light is thrown on the question by the statement of Dionysius that it was founded by the Umbrians, and passed from them to the Pelasgians. It was certainly one of the most powerful of the twelve Etrurian cities, and continued to maintain its position under the Romans; but probably from the fact that its supposed impregnability led the successive conquerors of Italy to pass it by, its name is rarely found in the ancient classics, and we are even ignorant of the date when it first fell into the hands of the Romans. It was colonized about the end of the 2d century n.c., but as the colony was never reneλved it is not mentioned in the lists of Pliny or Ptolemy. It was one of the first bishoprics of the Christian church; and after the barbarian invasions, it reappears in the Middle Ages as a place of importance. Held for about a century by the Casale family, it was transmitted by them to King Ladislas of Naples, who, in his turn, in 1412 bestowed it on the Florentines.
