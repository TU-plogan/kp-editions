CRÉBILLON, Claude Prosper Jolyot (1707-1777), a French novelist and wit of the 18th century, was the only son of Crébillon, the tragic poet. His life was spent at Paris, except about five years, during which, on account [9:6:557] of certain political references made in his novels, he was first imprisoned and afterwards forced to live in exile in England and elsewhere. He married an English lady of noble family, Lady Stafford, who is said to have been captivated by hjs person and his books, and to have offered herself as his bride. Their life is said to have been passed in much affection and mutual fidelity; and it would be unjust to judge Crébillon’s private life from his novels, the immorality of which is not surpassed in literature. For some years Crébillon held the incongruous office of censor.
