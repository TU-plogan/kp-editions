COSIN, John (1594-1672), bishop of Durham, was born at Norwich, November 30, 1594. From the grammar school of his native city he passed, at the age of sixteen, to Caius College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. After a few years he took holy orders and -was appointed domestic chaplain to the bishop of Durham. At the close of 1624 he was made a prebendary of Durlιam, and in the following year archdeacon of the East Riding of Yorkshire. Before this time he had married, and in 1628 he took his degree of D.D. He first became known as an author in 1627, when he published his Collection of Private Devotions, a manual stated to have been prepared by command of the king, Charles I., for the use of the maids of honour to the queen. This book, in connection with his insistence on points of ritual in his cathedral church and his friendship with Bishop Laud, exposed him to the suspicion and hostility of the Puritans; and the book was rudely handled by Prynneand Burton (who both, nine years later, were set in the pillory and mutilated for their free speeches on other matters). In the year following this publication Cosin took part in the prosecution of Prebendary Smart for a sermon against Papistical bishops and priests and practices; and the prebendary was deprived. In 1634 Cosin was appointed master of Peterhouse, Cambridge; and in 1640 he became vice-chancellor of the university. In October of this year he was promoted to the deanery of Peterborough. A few days before his installation the Long Parliament had met; and among the complainants who hastened to appeal to it for redress was the ex-prebendary, Smart. His petition against the new dean was considered; and early in 1641 Dr Cosin was sequestered from his benefices. Articles of impeachment were, two months later, presented against him, but he was dismissed on bail, and was not again called for. He took part, in 1642, in sending the university plate to the king, and was for this offence deprived of the mastership of Peterhouse. He thereupon withdrew to France, preached at Paris, served as chaplain to some members of the household of the exiled royal family, and at the Restoration he returned to England. He was reinstated in the mastership, restored to all his church benefices, and in a few months raised to the see of Durham (December 1660). This dignity he enjoyed for about eleven years; and during this time he applied a large share of his revenues to the promotion of the interests of the church, of schools, and of charitable institutions. He died in London, January 15, 1672.

Among his writings are a Historia Transubstantiationis Papalis, Notes and Collections on the Book of Common Prayer, and a Scholastical History of the Canon of Holy Scripture. A collected edition of his works, forming 5 vols, of the Oxford Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology, was published between 1843 and 1855.
