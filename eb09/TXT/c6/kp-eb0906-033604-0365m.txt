COOPER, Sir Astley Paston (1768-1841), a celebrated surgeon, was born at the village of Brooke, in Norfolk, August 23, 1768. His father, Dr Cooper, was a clergyman of the Church of England; his mother was the author of several novels. At the age of sixteen he was sent to London and placed under Mr Cline, surgeon to St Thomas’s Hospital. From the first he devoted himself to the study of anatomy, and had the privilege of attending the lectures of John Hunter. In 1787 he was appointed demonstrator of anatomy at St Thomas’s Hospital. In 1791 he delivered part of the course of lectures on anatomy and surgery at St Thomas’s Hospital. In this year he married; and in the spring of 1792 he visited Paris. In the latter year he was also appointed professor of anatomy to Surgeon’s Hall,—a situation which he again filled in 1794 and 1795. In 1800 he was appointed surgeon to Guy’s Hospital, on the death of his uncle, William Cooper. In 1802 he received the Copley medal for two papers read before the Royal Society of London on the destruction of the membrana tympani; and in 1805 he was elected a fellow of that society. Having taken an active part in the formation of the Medico-Chirurgical Society, he published in the first volume of its Transactions an account of an unsuccessful attempt to tie the carotid artery. Another of his remarkable attempts was to tie the aorta. In 1804 he brought out the first, and in 1807 the second, part of his great work on Hernia—the operation for which, on account of the defective knowledge of the local anatomy, was then frequently unsuccessful. So greatly did this work add to his reputation, that in 1813 his annual professional income rose to £21,000 sterling. He was soon after appointed professor of comparative anatomy to the Royal College of Surgeons. In 1820, he removed a steatomatous tumour from the head of George IV. About six months afterwards he accepted a baronetcy, which, as he had no son, was to descend to his nephew and adopted son, Astley Cooper; in 1827 he was elected president of the Royal College of Surgeons; and in 1830 vice-president of the Royal Society. He was also chosen member of the French Institute; the degree of D.C.L. was conferred on him by Oxford, and that of LL.D, by Edinburgh; and he was appointed sergeant-surgeon to [9:6:337] the king. He died on the 12th February 1841, at the age of seventy-three. He was interred, by his own desire, beneath the chapel of Guy’s Hospital; and a statue by Bailey was erected to his memory in St Paul’s Cathedral.

His chief works are Medical Records and Researches (1798); On Hernia (1804-7); Dislocations and Fractures (1822); Treatise on the Anatomy and Diseases of the Breast (1829-40); Anatomy of the Thymus Gland (1832). See Life of Sir A. Cooper, by B. Coopçr.
