CORDERIUS, the Latinized form of name used by Mathdrin Cordier (1478-1564), the author of the well-known Colloquia, a native in Normandy. He possessed special tact and liking for teaching children, and taught first at Paris, where Calvin was among his scholars, and, after a number of changes, finally at Geneva. He wrote several books for children; the most famous is his Colloquia, which has passed through innumerable editions, being used in schools for three centuries after his time.

He also wroteâ€” Principia Latine Loquendi Scribendique, selecta ex Epistolis Ciceronis; De Corrupti Sermonis apud Gallos Emendatione et Latini Loquendi Ratione; De Quantitate Syllabarum; Conciones Sacroe Gallice; Remontrances et exhortations au roi et aux grands de son royaume (Geneva, 1561).
