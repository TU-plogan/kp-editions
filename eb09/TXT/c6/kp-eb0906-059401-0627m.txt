CROeSUS, king of Lydia, was the son and successor of Alyattes. It was supposed by Clinton and Bähr that for fifteen years he shared the throne with his father; however that may be, he became sole king on the death of Alyattes, about 568 b.c. (according to the computation of Rawlinson), when, Herodotus tells us, he was thirty-five years old. Jïe speedily reduced all the Greek cities in Asia Minor, and soon most of the tribes to the west of the River Halys (the Kizil Irmak) were subject to him. The wealth, meanwhile, which he had inherited from his father had been enormously increased, until it far surpassed that of any other sovereign with whom the Greeks were acquainted. He was therefore to them the type of human prosperity; and the bitter contrast of his fall powerfully impressed itself on their imagination, which became in part the creator of the vividly dramatic story so finely told by Herodotus. The most famous incident in that story was the visit of Solon. After ostentatiously displaying all his treasures, the king asked the sage who was the happiest man he had ever known. Tellus of Athens, was the reply, for he lived while his country was prosperous; he was surrounded with children and children’s children, who were both beautiful and good; and he died upon the field of battle after having gained a gallant victory over the enemy. And next to him Solon counted two Argive youths, Cleobis and Bito, whose strength and skill won prizes at the games, who, when the oxen failed to appear from the fields in time, piously drew their mother’s car forty-five furlongs to the festival of Juno, and as reward received the praises of all men, and were allowed to die in the very temple of the goddess, after offering their sacrifices and feasting at the holy banquet in her honour. For two reasons, added the wise man, Croesus with all his fortune was not to be held so fortunate as these,—the gods ’ are jealous of human prosperity, and no man can be called fully happy till a happy death has closed a happy life. Soon after misfortunes began to thicken about Craesus. His son, despite all the care with which, being warned in a dream, he drew him from the dangers of battle, and sought to shield him even from accident, was unintentionally slain at a boar-hunt by Adrastus. News came also of the conquests of Cyrus, who had overcome Astyages, the brother-in-law of Croesus. The oracle of Delphi prophesied that if Craesus went to war he would “destroy a mighty empire,” and that he was to flee when a “mule” sat on the throne of Media; and, secure in what appeared to him the most unambiguous of prophecies, Craesus invaded Cappadocia. But the mighty empire he was to destroy proved to be his own; he was repulsed, and soon Sardis was stormed and taken by Cyrus. Craesus, careless of life, was about to be slain, when one of his sons, hitherto dumb, in his fear overcame his infirmity, and made known his father’s rank. Craesus w as therefore spared to be taken as a prisoner before Cyrus. He was placed on a funeral pyre, and, as he watched the rising flames, he thought of Solon, whose name burst from his lips. When questioned, he repeated the warning of the sage, which so powerfully affected tho mind of Cyrus that he ordered the flames tobe extinguished. The efforts of the soldiers, however, were in vain; but, as Herodotus narrates, the prayers of Craesus prevailed upon Apollo, whose temples he had formerly enriched with costly gifts, to send a heavy fall of rain which quenched the fire. The wisdom of Craesus gained the friendship of Cyrus, who also made him minister to his son, Cambyses. But, having ventured to reprove Cambyses for an act of cruelty, Craesus was forced to seek safety in flight; and here ends the story of his life. It is said that, when ho reproached the oracle which had led to his fall, he received the convincing answer that Cyrus was the “mule” foretold, as he was the son of a Median princess and a Persian subject. Apollo, it was added, had done what he could by prevailing on the fates to delay the fall of Craesus full three years.

See Herodotus (bk. i.), in Rawlinson’s edition of which (1875) there is a discussion of the historical facts of the story, an amplified version of which is given in Damascenus.
