COCKLE (Cardium), a genus of Acephalous Mollusks belonging to the family Cardiadae, and comprising about 200 species, nearly a third of which are said to occur in the Indian Ocean, while only a few, but these exceedingly abundant in individuals, and widely distributed, are found in northern and temperate latitudes. The shells of cockles are highly convex, and almost invariably show a ridge-and-furrow sculpture, the ridges or ribs being often spiny, and the valves locking closely together. The animal inhabiting the shell is provided with a large, fleshy, and highly elastic foot, by means of which it can rapidly bury itself in the soft muddy sand which it frequents, reappearing above the surface with equal facility. Iu performing those leaps, for which it is remarkable, “the long taper foot,” says Gosse, “is thrust to its utmost, and feels about for some resisting surface, a stone for instance, which it no sooner feels than the hooked point is pressed stiffly against it, the whole foot, by muscular contraction, is made suddenly rigid, and the entire creature—mantle, siphons, foot, shell, and all—is jerked away in an uncouth manner.” Many of the species are of considerable value as articles of food, especially the Common Cockle (Cardium edule), gregarious everywhere in the sandy bays and estuaries around the British coast, from low-water mark to a few fathoms deep, and extending from Iceland to the Canaries, and as far east as the Caspian and Aral Seas, where it occurs in one of its varieties. The shell of the cockle is liable to considerable variation, getting thinner and more elongated posteriorly in sheltered situations and in muddy ground, more convex and thicker when exposed to rougher conditions. They vary also in size from 1 inch to 2⅜ inches ‘ in breadth. They occur in great abundance on several parts of the British coast, and in many places cockle-gathering gives employment to large numbers of people; thus at Penclaw dd in Glamorganshire, the women and children are regularly employed in gathering and preparing cockles, which they afterwards dispose of in the Swansea market. At Starcross they have “cockle-gardens,” where those mollusks are reared, and these are said to possess a better flavour than the ordinary cockle. Some species or other of Cardium is used for food by the maritime populations of almost every country in the world, and the dietetic value of these mollusks appears to have been equally appreciated in prehistoric times, as the shell-mounds or kjökkenmöddings of many countries abundantly testify. As cockle shells contain about 90 per cent, of carbonate of lime, they are calcined and used instead of common lime where the latter cannot readily be obtained.
