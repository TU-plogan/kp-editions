CORA, an ancient city of Italy, about seven miles southeast of Rome by the Appian Way. Various traditions about its origin are found in the Roman writers; but all agree in acknowledging its great antiquity, and for a long period it ranked as one of the most important cities of Latium. After being lost sight of in history for about twelve hundred years it reappears in the 13 th century, and under the name of Cori it continues to the present day, a town of from 5000 to 6000 inhabitants. Situated on a hill that rises above the Ponptine marshes, and divided by an olive grove into two portions, Cori presents a fine appearance from the plain. Besides the walls erected in the 15th century by Ladislas of Naples, it preserves important remains of its earlier and perhaps its earliest defences, constructed of large polygonal blocks; part of a temple, usually distinguished by the name of Hercules, is incorporated in the church of St Pietro; two Corinthian columns of admirable execution mark the site of the temple of Castor and Pollux; numerous minor antiquities are scattered about the town; and the ravine outside the gateway leading to Ninfa is spanned by the Ponte della Catena, built of massive blocks of tufa.
