CREST, a town of France, in the department of Drome and arrondissement of Die, situated on the right bank of the River Drôme, there crossed by a fine stone bridge. It carries on the manufacture of woollens, cotton, and béetroot sugar. On the curious rock which commands the town there are some remains of the ancient castle to which it was indebted for its importance in the Middle Ages. It ranked for a time as the capital of the duchy of Valentinois, and in that capacity belonged before the Revolution to the prince of Monaco. The communal charter, dating from the 12th century, is preserved in the public archives. Population in 1872, 5568.
