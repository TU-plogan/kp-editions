COSNE, a town of France in the department of Nièvre, at the head of an arrondissement on the right bank of the Loire, 35 miles N.N.W. of Nevers. It has a tribunal of primary instance, a communal college and an agricultural society. Some ruins of its mediaeval walls, towers, and castle are still preserved. In the vicinity there are extensive forges for the making of anchors and other heavy iron articles. Cosne is mentioned in the Antonine Itinerary under the name of Condate, but it was not till the Middle Ages that it rose into importance as a military post. It was at Cosne that the arrest of Crussol took place which gave rise to the War of the Public Weal under Louis XT.
