CUNNINGHAM, Allan (1784-1842), a Scottish poet and prose writer, was born at Blackwood, in Dumfriesshire, and began life as a stone mason’s apprentice. He commenced literary work as collector of ballads for Cromek’s Remains of Nithsdale and Galloway Song; but, instead of collecting ballads, he sent in poems of his own, which the editor inserted without suspicion. In 1810 he repaired to London, where he supported himself partly by working in the studio of Bubb the statuary, and partly as a newspaper reporter, till 1814, when he obtained the situation of clerk of the works in the studio of Francis Chantrey, in which he continued till the sculptor’s death in 1841. He meanwhile continued to be busily engaged in literary work. Cunningham’s prose is often spoiled by its misplaced and too ambitious rhetoric; his verse also is often over-ornate; and both are full of mannerisms. Some of his songs, however, from their brightness, vigour, and warmth of feeling, hold a high place in our lyrical literature.

His chief works are Lives of the Most Eminent British Painters, Sculptors, and Architects (1829-1833), Sir Marmaduke Maxwell, a dramatic poem, Traditionary Tales of the Peasantry, several novels (Paul Jones, Sir Michael Scott, Lord Roldan), the Maid of Elwar, a sort of epic romance, the Songs of Scotland (1825), Biographical and Critical History of the Literature of the Last Fifty Years (1833), an edition of The Works of Robert Burns, with notes and a life containing a good deal of new material (1834), Biographical and Critical Dissertations affixed to Major’s Cabinet Gallery of Pictures, enA Life, Journals, and Correspondence of Sir David Wilkie, finished two days before his own decease, and published in 1843. An edition of his Poems and Songs was issued by his son, Peter Cunningham, in 1847.
