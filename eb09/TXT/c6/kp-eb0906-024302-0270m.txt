CONCORDIA, a village of Italy in the province of Venice, 35 miles N.E. of the city of that name, and in the immediate neighbourhood of the town of Portogruaro, of importance as preserving the name and marking the site of a famous Roman city of the later empire. It was probably founded by Augustus, on the pacification of his dominions, and consequently bears the full title of Colonia Julia Concordia. Its rapidly growing prosperity, well attested even by the fragmentary remains of its buildings, was suddenly crushed by Attila in 452 a.d.; but its continued existence throughout the Middle Ages is proved both by history and by archaeology. The baptistry still extant is in the style of the 9th century, and an inscription preserves the memory of a bishop Regimpotus of the 10th. The place has been brought again into notice by the discovery, in 1873, of the old Christian cemetery which has furnished upwards of 160 stone coffins, in several cases distinguished by inscriptions of considerable import to the historian.—See Bullettino dell ’ Instituto di Corr. Arch. 1874.
