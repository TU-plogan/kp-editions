COLBERG, or Kolberg, a fortified seaport town of Prussia, in the former province of Pomerania, and the government of Köslin, on the right bank of the Persante, which falls into the Baltic about a mile below the town. It has a handsome market-place, adorned since 1864 with a statue of Frederick William IV.; and there are several pretty extensive suburbs, of which the most important is the Munde, in great measure the growth of the present century. The principal buildings are the cathedral of St Mary’s, one of the most remarkable churches in Pomerania, dating from 1316, the council-house erected after the plans of Zwirner, the citadel, and the aqueduct by which the town is supplied with water. Colbergalso possesses several hospitals, a workhouse, a house of correction, an orphan asylum, a gymnasium, a preparatory school of navigation, and an exchange. Its bathing establishments are largely frequented and attract a considerable number of summer visitors. Woollen cloth and spirits are manufactured; there is an extensive salt-mine in the neighbouring Zillenberg; the salmon and lamprey fisheries are important; and a fair amount of commercial activity is maintained. Population in 1872, 13,106.

Colberg was the seat of a bishop as early as the 10th century, though it not long after lost this distinction. Till 1277 it was the chief town of the Cassubian Wends, and after that date it ranked as the most important place in the episcopal principality of Karnin, with which it passed in 1648 to Brandenburg. In the Thirty Years’ War it was captured by the Swedes, after a protracted siege in 1631; and in the Seven Years’ War it was one of the centres of the conflict. In 1758 it withstood the attacks of General Palmb'ach and his army of 10,000 men, and in 1760 it held out against the Russian and Swedish forces, both by sea and land, till it was relieved by the advance of Werner; but in 1761 it was compelled by famine to yield to Romanzoff after a four months’ investment and violent bombardment. In 1807 it was surrounded by 18,000 men under the command of Feulié, Loison, and Mortier; but the burgher Nettelbeck within and the free-fighter Schill without succeeded in defending it till the peace of Tilsit brought the war to a close.
