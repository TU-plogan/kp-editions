COTTON, George Edward Lynch (1813-1866), headmaster of Marlborough School and bishop of Calcutta, metropolitan in India and Ceylon, was born at Chester, October 29, 1813. He was the son of an officer who was killed at the battle of the Nivelle a fortnight after his son’s birth, and grandson of Dr Cotton, formerly dean of Chester. He received his education at Westminster School, whence he passed in 1832 to Trinity College, Cambridge. Here he became an adherent of the Low Church party, and at the same time the intimate friend of several disciples of Dr Arnold, among whom were Dr Vaughan of Harrow, W J. Conybeare, and Dr Howson. The influence of Arnold was powerful enough to determine the character and course of his w’liole life. He graduated B.A. in 1836, and was forthwith appointed by Dr Arnold to an assistant-mastership at Rugby. Here he worked steadily and devotedly for fifteen years, inspired with the spirit and heartily entering into the plans and methods of his beloved master. He became master of the fifth formabout 1840. He made himself the sympathizing companion and friend of his pupils; and by the force of his character and the geniality of his disposition gained their unbounded esteem and love. In 1852 he accepted the appointment of head-master of Marlborough College, which was then in a state of serious financial embarrassment and of almost hopeless disorganization; but, giving himself to the task of reforming it with all his heart, in his six years’ of rule he rescued it from impending dissolutior, and raised it to a high position. In 1858 Cotton was offered the see of Calcutta, vacant by the death of Dr Daniel Wilson; and this high post, after much hesitation about quitting Marlborough, he accepted. For its peculiar duties and responsibilities he was remarkably fitted by the simplicity and solidity of his character, by his large tolerance, by his capacity of sympathy with other men, and by the experience which he had gained as teacher and ruler at Rugby and Marlborough. It was natural that the cause of [9:6:509] education should especially engage his attention in his new sphere; and through his zealous endeavours a large number of schools were established, the working of which must be among the most beneficent influences of English rule in India. Bishop Cotton endeared himself to men of all parties, and his sudden death was mourned as a loss throughout his vast diocese. On his return journey from a visitation tour in the autumn of 1866, he slipped while passing in the twilight, October 6, along the plank from his barge towards the shore at Kooshtea, on the Ganges, and was drowned. The body was borne away by the current and never seen again. A memoir of his life, with selections from his journals and correspondence, edited by his widow, was published in 1870.
