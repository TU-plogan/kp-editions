CONCORDIA, the goddess of concord, a Roman divinity, in whose honour several temples were erected at Rome. The most ancient of these was that built on the declivity of the Capitol by Camillus, 367 b.c. In this temple the senate sometimes assembled. It was restored by Livia, the wife of Augustus, and consecrated by Tiberius, 9 a.d. In the time of Constantine and Maxentius it was destroyed by fire, but was again restored. The second temple was erected close to that of Vulcan by Cn. Flavius; and there was a third built by L. Manlius, on the Capitoline Hill. Concordia was represented as a matron holding in her right hand a patera, or an olive branch, and in her left a cornucopia. Her symbols were two hands joined together, and two serpents entwined about a caduceus, or heraldâ€™s staff.
