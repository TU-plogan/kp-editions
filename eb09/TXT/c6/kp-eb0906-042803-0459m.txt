CORO, or Santa-Ana de Coro, a maritime town of Venezuela, South America, and capital of the province of Falcon, is situated in a sandy plain at the inner angle of a peninsula, dividing the Gulf of Venezuela from the Caribbean Sea, 155 miles W.N.W. of Valencia. It is ill built, the streets are unpaved, and there are no public buildings of consequence except two churches. The climate is hot but not unhealthy. The water-supply is brought by mules from springs at some distance from the town. About seven miles to the north-east is the port, near the mouth of the little Rio Coro. The export trade with the West Indies, in mules, goats, hides, cheese, pottery-ware, indigo, and cochineal, is considerably less than formerly. Coro is one of the oldest settlements of the Spaniards on the north coast of S. America. It was founded on the 26th July 1527 (St Ann’s day), by Juan de Ampués, who named it Santa Ana de Coriana after the Indian tribe inhabiting the spot. It came also to be known as Venezuela (or Little λ 7 enice), which was the name given originally to an Indian village founded on piles in the water on the east side of the lake of Maracaibo. In 1578 Carácas was made the seat of the government of the country instead of Coro, and in 1583 the bishopric of Coro, founded in 1536, was transferred thither. In 1815 Coro was made the chief town of a province. It suffered greatly in the Venezuelan war of independence. Population about 7000.
