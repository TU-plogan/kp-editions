COSTANZO, Angelo di (about 1507-1591), an Italian historian and poet, was born at Naples about 1507. His great work is Le Istorie del Regno di Napoli dal 1250 fino al 1489, which first appeared at Naples in 1572, and was the fruit of thirty or forty yearsâ€™ labour; but ten more years were devoted to the task before it appeared in its final form at Aquila (1582). It is still one of the best histories of Naples; and the style is distinguished by clearness, simplicity, and elegance. As a poet Costanzo is remarkable for finical taste, for polish and frequent beauty of expression, and for strict obedience to the poetical canons of his time.
