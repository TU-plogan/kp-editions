COLERIDGE, Hartley (1796-1849), the elder son of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, was born on the 19th of September 1796, at Clevedon, a small village near Bristol. His early years were passed at Keswick, where his education was conducted in a somewhat desultory manner. He gave promise of great mental power, but derived less advantage from systematic studies than from intercourse with S. T. Coleridge, Wordsworth, Southey, De Quincey, and Professor Wilson. In 1815 he went to Oxford, as scholar of Merton College, the means for his support being principally provided by Southey. His university career, however, was very unfortunate. He had inherited the weakness of purpose, as well as the splendid conversational powers, of his father, and, having never enjoyed the benefit of a regular discipline, lost all self-restraint amidst the gaieties of Oxford, and finally lapsed into habits of intemperance. He was successful in gaining an Oriel fellowship, but at the close of the probationary year was judged to have forfeited it. The authorities could not be prevailed on to reverse their decision; but they awarded to him a free gift of £300. With this, Hartley Coleridge came to London in 1821, and remained there for two years, during which he wrote short poems for the London Magazine. His next step was to set up school at Ambleside, but this scheme failed, after five years of struggle in a position for which he was wholly unfit. Coleridge then removed to Grasmere, where he lived in great seclusion,—writing between 1826 and 1831 Essays for Blackwood, and in 1832 his Biographia Borealis, or Lives of Northern Worthies. In 1839 appeared his last work, the Life of Massinger, an elaborate and artistic production. The closing decade of Coleridge’s life was wasted in what he himself calls “the woeful impotence of weak resolve.” In 1848 his health became sensibly affected, and he expired on the 6th of January 1849. The prose style of Hartley Coleridge is marked by much finish and vivacity; but his literary reputation must chiefly rest on his poetical remains. Of these the Sonnets, and Prometheus, an unfinished lyric drama, are the finest. The influence of Wordsworth is discernible in his poetry, but it does not on that account want originality.
