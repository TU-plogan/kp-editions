COVENANTERS, in Scottish history, the name applied to a party, embracing the great majority of the people, who during the 17th century bound themselves to establish and maintain the Presbyterian doctrine and polity as the sole religion of the countrv, to the exclusion of Prelacy and [9:6:530] Popery. An account of the covenanting cause as a religious and political movement belongs to the history of Scotland. There were several successive Covenants, similar in spirit and expression, the most important historically being the National Covenant of 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant of 1643. These were both based upon earlier documents. In 1581 the General Assembly of Scotland adopted a confession of faith, or national covenant, drawn up by John Craig, condemning Episcopal government, under the name of hierarchy. This covenant was signed by James I. and enjoined on all his subjects. It was again subscribedin 1590 and 1596. The subscription was renewed in 1638, and the subscribers engaged by oath to maintain religion in the same state in which it existed in 1580, and to reject all innovations introduced since that time. This oath annexed to the confession of faith of 1581 received the name of the National Covenant. The additional matter was prepared by Johnston of Warriston and Alexander Henderson, and was intended to suit the document to the special circumstances of the time. It was adopted and signed by a large gathering in Greyfriars’ Churchyard, Edinburgh, on the 28th February, and copies were sent next day throughout the country for additional signatures. The Solemn League and Covenant was established in the year 1643, and formed a bond between Scotland, England, and Ireland for the united preservation of the Reformed religion in the Church of Scotland, the reformation of religion in England and Ireland “according to the Word of God and the example of the best Reformed churches,” and the extirpation of Popery and Prelacy. It was sworn and subscribed by many in both nations, approved by the Parliament and. Assembly at Westminster, and ratified by the General Assembly of Scotland in 1645. King Charles I. disapproved of it when he surrendered himself to the Scottish army in 1646; but in 1650 Charles II. by a solemn oath declared his approbation both of this and of the National Covenant; and in August the same year he made a further declaration at Dunfermline to the same purpose, which was renewed on the occasion of his coronation at Scone in 1651. In the same year also the covenant was ratified by Parliament, and subscription to it required from every member,—it being declared that without such subscription the constitution of the Parliament was null and void. It was afterwards renounced by Charles, and declared illegal by 13 and 14 Car. II. c. 4 (1662).

The two Covenants are usually published along with the Westminster Confession of Faith, though they are not now included among the authoritative symbols of any Presbyterian church.
