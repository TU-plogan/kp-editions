COMO, Lake of, or, in Italian, Lago di Como, known to the Romans as Lacus Larius, is, from the beauty of its scenery and the mildness of its climate, one of the most celebrated of all the Italian lakes. It is situated in the province of Como, in that part of the country which belonged to the kingdom of Lombardy, and it occupies the bottom of a great valley, which, stretching south from the neighbourhood of Chiavenna at the foot of the Splügen, breaks up at Bellaggio into two branches which run respectively south-east and south-west. The lake is thus divided into three basins, of which the south western is known more particularly as the Lago di Como, and the southeastern as the Lago di Lecco. The northern part of the original basin has been silted up by the debris brought down from the valleys of San Giacomo and Bregaglia by the River Mera; and not only∣has the Adda, which enters from the east, filled up the branch that in all probability once extended up the Valtelline as far as Morbegno i but it has also, by its delta, or cone of ejection, cut off from the main body of the lake the part now known as the Lago di Mezzola. Of the real form of the bed of the lake there was hardly any knowledge till 1865, when a survey was undertaken by Signor Gentilli and MM. Casella and Bernasconi. The results obtained were published by Gentilli in the second volume of the Memoirs of the Società Italiana di Scieme Naturali, and by his coadjutors in a separate pamphlet entitled Cenni Orograβci sul Lago di Como. It appears that the greatest depth is 1341 feet, which was registered in a section of the Lago di Como from Torrigia to Como. From the northern extremity of the lake the basin gradually grows deeper as we advance southwards, till it shallows towards the promontory of Bellaggio; in the south-western branch it grows rapidly deeper again, while in the south-eastern it shallows to 390 or 290 feet. This difference of the two branches is easily explained by the fact that the Lago di Como is a closed basin except at its junction with the main body of the lake, and throughout a coast line of upwards of forty miles receives only two unimportant torrents, while the Lago di Lecco is in the direct course of the Adda, which makes its exit by the southern extremity. The total length of the lake, from Como to its northern ext emity, is about thirty miles, and its greatest width, between Menaggio and Varenna, about two miles and a half. The shores of the lake are studded with ancient castles, flourishing hamlets, and the villas of wealthy proprietors. On the eastern side the principal places are Colico-piano, Dervio, Bellano, Varenna, Mandello, and Lecco; and along the western Gravedona, Dongo, Menaggio, Cadenabbia, Argegno, Moltrasio, and Cernobbio. Bellaggio, as already mentioned, is situated at the promontory where the lake bifurcates southwards. The Villa Vigorni, near Menaggio, formerly the property of Mylius of Frankfort, contains sculptures of Thorwaldsen, Marchesi, and Argenti; the Villa Giulia, near Bellaggio, belongs to the king of the Belgians; the Villa Carlotta or Sommariva, near Cadenabbia, took its name from Charlotte of Prussia, wife of the duke of Saxe-Meiningen; the Villa d’Este, near Cernobbio, was at one time the residence of Queen Caroline of England. The Villa Raimondi or Odescalchi, is the largest of all.
