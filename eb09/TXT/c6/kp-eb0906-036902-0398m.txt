CORALS (Coralliaria). Under the general name of

“Coral-Animals” are included all those members of the Actinozoa which have the power of secreting hard structures of the nature of a skeleton. Whether this skeleton be continuous or discontinuous, of conspicuous dimensions or simply of microscopic spicula, it constitutes what is known properly as the “coral” or “corallum;” and the animals which produce it are the so-called “Coralligenous Zoophytes” (Actinozoa Coralligena). The class of the Actinozoa is one of the primary divisions of the sub-kingdom of the Coelenterata, or Radiated Animals; and those forms of the class which secrete a corallum belong to the orders of the Zoantharia, Rugosa, and Alcyonaria. No corallum is ever produced in the order Ctenophora, and many members of the Zoantharia are either destitute of a skeleton or have but an imperfect one, whilst the corallum of the Alcyonaria is also often rudimentary. The Ctenophora, therefore, will be wholly omitted here; and only those members of the Zoantharia and Alcyonaria in which a well-developed corallum is present, will be considered at any length,—the soft-bodied forms requiring no notice except in so far as they serve to elucidate the peculiarities of the Coralligenous groups.

The class of the Actinozoa comprises those Coelenterate animals in which the space included within the body-walls is divided into an inner “gastric” cavity or stomach and an outer “perivisceral” cavity. The gastric sac is short and is open below, so that the perivisceral cavity freely communicates with the outer world through the mouth, and the two cavities become practically one. The perivisceral cavity, in turn, is divided into a series of compartments by the development of a series of vertical membranous plates (the “mesenteries”), which are arranged in a radiating manner between the walls of the gastric sac and the wall of the body. The reproductive organs are not external, but are attached to the faces of the mesenteries, and shed their contents into the body-cavity. The ova reach the external medium either through the mouth or through the ends of the tentacles.

The class of the Actinozoa is divided into four orders, viz., the Zoantharia (Sea-Anemones, Madreporaria, <fcc.), the Rugosa (Cyathophyllum,Zaphrentis, &c.), the Alcyonaria (Red Coral, Sea-Pens, Sea-Shrubs, Organ-pipe Corals, <fcc.), and the Ctenophora (Beroë, Pleurobrachia, Venus’s Girdle, &c.)

Order I.— Zoantharia (Hexacoralla).

The members of this order are distinguished by the fact that the intermesenteric chambers and tentacles are generally and fundamentally six in number, or some multiple of six, however largely they may be subsequently increased, whilst the tentacles are simple, rounded, or conical, not fringed with lateral processes. The corallum may be wholly absent (Actinidae), spicular (Zoanthidce), in the form of an internal axis or “sclerobasis” (Antipathidae), or “sclerodermic,” with a distinct wall, and generally distinct septa (as in the Madrepores, and the “Stone-corals” generally). According to the nature of the skeletal structures the Zoantharia are divided into the three groups of the malacodermata, sclerobasica, and sclerodermata. Zoantharia malacodermata.— In this section are the animals commonly known as Sea-Anemones, in which there is either no skeleton at all (Actinidae), or simply a discontinuous pseudo-skeleton composed of minute adventitious spicules scattered through the integuments (Zoanthidae). Though possessing nothing that would ordinarily be termed a “coral,” it may be well to insert here a general description of the anatomy of the Sea-Anemones, as they are readily accessible for study, and may be regarded as being fundamentally identical in the structure of their soft parts with the coralligenous Zoantharia, as well (probably) as with the extinct Rugosa.

The true Sea-Anemones (Actinia, Tealia, Actinoloba, Sagartza, &c.) are under ordinary circumstances simple animals, but some closely allied forms (Zoanthus and Paly th oa) form compound growths or colonies, which are produced by budding, and consist of numerous polypes united by a fleshy base or coenosarc. In the simple forms the body is generally a short cylinder or truncated cone (the “column”), usually of a fleshy or leathery consistence, and capable of undergoing great variations in shape. The lower extremity of the column usually forms a flattened discoidal area (the “base”), whereby the animal attaches itself at will to foreign bodies. The base, however, may be wholly non-adherent, pointed (Ily an thus), thin, distensible, and imperforate (Edwardsia), or swollen, rounded, and pierced with a distinct orifice (Peachia and Cerianthus). The upper surface of the column constitutes a circular flattened area (the “disc ”), which carries the tentacles round its margin, and is perforated centrally by the aperture of the mouth.

In size the Sea-Anemones vary from less than a sixth of an inch up to 2 feet in diameter; and their habits of life are very various. Generally they attach themselves by the muscular base to foreign bodies, in rock-pools, at low-water mark, or extending to considerable depths. Others, again (such as Peachia, Halcampa, and Edwardsia), live more or less completely buried in the sand; Cerianthus has the same habit, and further protects the body by the secretion of a loose, membranous, non-adherent tube; whilst Arachnactis is free-swimming and pelagic.

The integuments of the Sea-Anemones consist of an outer layer (“ectoderm ”), an inner layer (“endoderm ”), and a more or less largely developed intermediate layer (“mesoderm ”), each of which may in turn be differentiated into successive more or less distinguishable strata. The ectoderm is composed of an exterior stratum of ciliated epithelial cells, a granular stratum crowded with “thread-cells,” and a stratum of pigment to which the brilliant coloration so characteristic of these animals is due. The peripheral epithelial cells are constantly being thrown off from the surface as a viscid mucus, which may entangle foreign bodies and form a species of investing tube. In other cases (Tealia, Bunodes), the surface is studded with adhesive vesicular warts, by means of which the integument obtains [9:6:370] an adventitious coat of fragments of shell, grains of sand, and small pieces of stone. The mesoderm is essentially composed of two layers of muscular fibres, those of the outer layer having a circular direction, whilst those of the inner layer are longitudinal in the column and become radial in the base and disc. The endoderm is likewise double in its composition, its inner stratum being formed of ciliated epithelial cells.

The “thread-cells” (cnidae or nematocysts), which are so abundantly developed in the integument of the Sea-Anemones, are microscopic organs of offence and defence. Though differing very much in size and in the details of structure in different species, the thread-cells consist essentially of an elastic do able-walled sac, one extremity of which is invaginated and carries a long, often serrated or spinose filament, which lies coiled up in the interior of the sac. On the slightest pressure the sac is instantaneously everted, and the lasso-like thread in its interior is shot forth with the rapidity of lightning, having the power of penetrating any soft body with which it may come in contact, and apparently inflicting an envenomed puncture.

The organs of prehension of the Sea-Anemones are the “tentacles” (tentacula). These are hollow, smooth, conical or filiform organs, arranged around the margin of *the disc in one or more successive circles. The walls of the tentacles are formed of the general integuments of the body, and each communicates inferiorly with an intermesenteric chamber, and is thus filled with fluid derived from the general cavity of the body. They are capable of extension and retraction, and their extremities are commonly perforated, though sometimes swollen and impervious (Corynactis, Caryophyllia). They are abundantly furnished with thread-cells, and are, therefore, organs of touch as well as of prehension. Except in some cases, where one or more tentacles may be aborted, the number of the tentacles seems to be primitively six, and remains some multiple of this during life,— the number of these organs being increased by the development of successive cycles arranged in concentric and alternating circles. The primitive cycle consists of six tentacles, the second cycle also of six, the third cycle of twelve, the fourth cycle of twenty-four, the fifth of forty-eight, and so on, the number of each cycle being invariably double that of the preceding cycle, except in the case of the second cycle. Though it has been generally accepted that the number of the tentacles is primitively six in the Zoantharιa (hence often called Hexactiniae), and that their increase is as above stated, grave doubts have of late arisen as to the correctness of this view. According to Lacaze-Duthiers, the primitive tentacles are first two in number, then four, then six, then eight, and finally twelve (in the Actiniae). According, also, to competent observers (Gosse, Fischer, and others) the adult Sea-Anemones by no means invariably possess tentacles which are a multiple of six, or even of five. On the contrary, various species have tentacles which are a multiple of eight, whilst in others the numerical arrangement of the tentacles seems to belong to an indeterminate type. Though showing a marked radiate arrangement, it will be subsequently shown, in speaking of the mesenteries, that even the tentacles occasionally show distinct traces of bilateral symmetry.

Internal to the circle of tentacles, the upper surface of the disc exhibits a more or less conspicuous flattened area (“peristomial space ”), which is destitute of appendages, but is marked with converging lines (“radii”), which start from the bases of the tentacles and meet round the mouth, and which represent the upper attached edges of the mesenteries. In the centre of the peristomial space, often at the summit of a kind of proboscis, is placed the opening of the oval or fissure-like mouth. The angles of the mouth are furnished with grooves (“gonidial grooves”), which serve as channels for the conveyance of the ova to the exterior. The mouth opens by the intervention of a short corrugated and folded gullet into a membranous stomach, with thin muscular walls, usually descending about one-third of the distance towards the base. The stomach, when distended, is of a globular form, and it opens inferiorly directly into the general cavity of the body, by a wide patulous opening. "When not in use, the walls of the stomach are in contact; its sides exhibit the downward continuation of the oral gonidial grooves. In some forms, a layer of coloured fat-cells is developed in the walls of the stomach towards its upper portion, and this is conjectured by Mr Gosse to represent the liver. No other distinct alimentary organs exist, and indigestible matters are got rid of through the moutíi.

The general cavity of the body (“somatic cavity ”) freely communicates with the external medium through the stomachic sac and mouth, and is bounded externally by the integuments, and lined by the endoderm. The space thus formed is subdivided into a series of chambers or compartments by a number of radiating vertical membranous laminae, to which the name of “mesenteries” is given. The mesenteries are essentially double, each being composed of an inward reduplication of the muscular mesoderm, covered by the endoderm, and they vary greatly in width. The first-formed and widest mesenteries (“primary mesenteries ”) are attached by the whole of their outer edges to the column-wall, by their upper edges to the disc from its margin to the mouth, and by their lower edges to the base from the circumference to the centre. The inner edges of the primary mesenteries are attached to the sides of the stomach, from the mouth almost to its inferior opening; but below this point they present a free, curved margin, which looks inwards towards the centre of the visceral chamber, being ultimately continued to the centre of the base. Between the primary mesenteries are developed other shorter laminae, which agree with the preceding in being attached externally along their whole length to the column-wall, but which do not extend sufficiently far inwards to reach the walls of the stomach, According to their width these are known as “secondary” and “tertiary” mesenteries. The primitive number of the primary mesenteries is normally six, and the development of the remaining mesenteries is effected by the same law as governs the development of the tentacles. Thus the second [9:6:371] cycle of mesenteries agrees with the first in being six in number, the third cycle is twelve, the fourth twenty-four, the fifth forty-eight, and so on. In some Sea-Anemones only twelve mesenteries are developed (Peachia), but ordinarily the number of these organs present in the adult is much greater. As already indicated with regard to the tentacles, it cannot be regarded as certain that the hexameral arrangement of the mesenteries, which is so conspicuous a feature in many of the Zoantharia, is by any means universal in the order, or even in the Zoantharia malacodermata in particular. Many of the adult forms, at any rate, appear to invariably possess mesenteries which are not a multiple of six in number. According to the researches of Rötteken and Schneider, the mesenteries are invariably of three orders in the Actiniae, each individual mesentery being double, and the smallest number of each order that was observed being six of the first cycle, six of the second, and twelve of the third order.

It is chiefly to the star-like disposition of the mesenteries and tentacles that the Sea-Anemones owe their conspicuous radial symmetry; but indications are not wanting of true bilaterality. Thus a single tentacle may be of a different colour from, or a larger size than the others; the two radii of the disc which correspond with the gonidial grooves and run to the angles of the mouth are often more conspicuous than the other radii; the mouth itself runs fore-and-aft, and divides the body into a right and left half; there may be only a single mouth-angle and gonidial groove (Actinoloba); and. lastly, two of the mesenteries, corresponding with the opposite mouth angles, are commonly developed before the rest. Even more conspicuous traces of bilateral symmetry which will be subsequently alluded to, are recognizable in many corals.

The entire body-cavity, with the intermesenteric chambers and tentacular diverticula, is filled with a transparent fluid (“chylaqueous fluid ”), which is to be regarded as the representative of the blood. It consists of sea-water mixed with the products of digestion, containing albumen in solution along with numerous floating corpuscles, representing the “blood-corpuscles” of the higher animals. There are no proper circulating organs, but a free circulation of the chylaqueous fluid through all parts of the body is effected by means of the richly ciliated endoderm which lines all parts of the somatic cavity.

No distinct respiratory organs are present, as a rule, the function of respiration being discharged by the ciliated endoderm, as well as by the currents in the external water maintained by the cilia covering the tentacles. In some species, however, which live half-buried in the sand, there are found lobed and frilled organs attached to or beside the tentacles, and these have been conjectured to be branchial (Verrill). In the Zoanthidae, aιso, there are found curious paired organs covered with cilia, and attached to the primary mesenteries a little below the stomach; and these may probably be regarded as gills (Dana).

The free edges of the mesenteries below the stomach are thickened, and constitute a puckered and convoluted marginal cord (“craspedum ”), which is richly furnished with thread-cells. Also attached to the free edges of the mesenteries are sometimes found the organs known as “acontia.” These are long, thread-like filaments, which are only attached by one end to the mesentery, and are crowded with thread-cells. The acontia seem to be undoubtedly organs of offence and defence, as they can, on irritation, be rapidly shot forth from the mouth, as well as from certain minute orifices in the body-wall (cinclides) which appear to be specially intended for their emission.

Specialized organs of the senses are either wanting in the Sea-Anemones, or only present in a rudimentary condition. Tactile sensibility, though well developed, is generally diffused over the surface, residing more particularly in the tentacles. Organs of hearing are wholly unknown. As regards the sense of sight, many species possess round the margins of the disc a series of brightly-coloured bead-like bodies (“marginal spherules,” “bourses marginales,” or “chromatoph ores ”), which are said to be furnished with nervous filaments, and which may with great probability be regarded as imperfect organs of vision. The condition of the nervous system is still a matter of great obscurity, and its very existence has generally been considered as doubtful. According, however, to recent researches (Duncan), it would appear that a plexiform arrangement of nerve fibres can be detected in the base of Actinia, a similar nervous apparatus probably existing in the disc as well.

The reproductive organs are in the form of thickened bands, of an orange or pink colour, enclosed in the mesenteries near their free edges, and the ovaries and testes are similar to one another in form and structure, differing only in their contents. As a rule, the sexes appear to be distinct, but in some forms they are united in the same individual. The reproductive elements escape into the body-cavity by dehiscence of the reproductive glands, but the precise manner in which the ova of the dioecious species are fertilized has not been determined. In addition to true sexual reproduction, increase is sometimes effected, non-sexually, by gemmation or fission. Gemmation is rare amongst the Sea-Anemones, the new polypes being budded forth from the sides of the parents close to the base, and being finally detached as independent animals. Fission is not by any means so rare, and may either take place by a longitudinal cleavage of the original polype into two wholly or partially independent individuals (Antheus and Actinia), or by the separation of portions of the margins of the base of the parent, and by the development of these into new polypes (Actinoloba, Sagartid).

As regards their development, the fecundateα ovum becomes converted into an ovate, ciliated, actively locomotive embryo (“planula ”), with a double wall enclosing a central cavity. A depression next appears at one extremity, indicating the future mouth, and the embryo passes into the “gastrula” stage, by the opening up of a communication between its central cavity and the exterior medium, or by invagination on itself, it being still uncertain which of these modes is employed. The gastrula now fixes itself by one extremity to some foreign body, and the primitive mesenteries and tentacles are developed. These are originally six in number; but according to Lacaze-Duthiers the first and second cycles (tw elve in all) are developed by passing successively through the numbers two, four, six, and eight. The remaining cycles of tentacles and mesenteries are rapidly added, until the animal attains the full number of these organs proper to the adult.

As to the geographical distribution of the Zoantharia malacodermata little need be said, as the members of this group, taken as a whole, are cosmopolitan in their range. They are, however, pre-eminently characteristic of the littoral and laminarian zones, only very few forms, and these not typical Sea-Anemones, extending to depths of over 500 fathoms (Palythoa), and one genus (Arachnactis) being pelagic. As to their distribution in time, nothing at all can be said, as, from the soft nature of their bodies, they have left no traces of their past existence.

The Zoantharia malacodermata may be divided into the following three families :—

Fam. I. Actinidae. —Polypes essentially simple, the base forming a flattened sucker by means of which the animal adheres at pleasure to foreign bodies. No corallum. (Actinia, Sagartia, Bunodes, Tealia, Bolocera, Antheus, Bhymactis, Adamsia, Cancrisocia, Corynactis, <fcc.)

Fam. II. Ilyanthidae. —Polypes simple, destitute of an adherent [9:6:372] base, free and. pelagic, or living buried to the lips in mud or sand. No corallum, but occasionally a membranous epidermic tube of investment. {Ilyanthus, Peachia, Edwardsia, Ceτian- thus, Halcampa.')

Fam. III. Zoanthidae. —Polypes adherent, united by a creeping or crust-like caenosarc, rarely solitary, and never capable of locomotion. No true corallum, but generally a pseudoskeleton formed by adventitious particles of sand or stone imbedded in the ectoderm. (Zoanthus, Epizoanthus, Palythoa.) Zoantharia scier obasica.— The “Black Corals,” or Antipathidae, which comprise this group, are always composite, consisting of a number of polypes united together by a thin fleshy caenosarc, which is spread over and supported by a simple or commonly branched horny axis, or “sclero base.” The tissues are not furnished with calcareous secretions, and the polypes have in general six simple tentacles.

The Antìpathidae form colonies which are attached by the base to some foreign object, and are generally more or less branched and plant-like. The colony consists of a thin fleshy crust or caenosarc, in which the minute polypes are imbedded at intervals. The polypes are furnished with six simple conical tentacles each, though in the genus Gerardia as many as twenty-four of these organs may be present. The soft tissues appear to be wholly destitute of calcareous secretions of any kind, such as are found in the Gorgonidae. The entire caenosarc, with its imbedded polypes, is supported by a horny corallum, which is generally black in colour, and forms an axis or stem covered by the soft parts. The corallum is secreted by the caenosarc, and is wholly external to the polypes, for which reason it constitutes what is technically called a “sclerobasis” or “sclerobasic corallum” (“foot-secretion” of Mr Dana), in contradistinction to the true tissue secretions of so many other Actinozoa. In some instances (Cirrhipathes) the sclerobasis is simple and unbranched, and may attain a length of several feet; but it is more commonly branched in a more or less plantlike and complicated manner (Antipathes, Arachnopathes, Rhipidopathes). The surface of the corallum may be smooth (Leiopathes) ; but it is more commonly covered with minute spines (Antipathes), being thus readily distinguished from the grooved or striated sclerobasis of the Gorgonidae. In composition the corallum is horny.

The Antipathidae constitute the only known family of the Zoantharia sclerobasica, as most naturalists are now agreed that the “Glass-rope Zoophytes” (Hyalonemadae), with their twisted siliceous axis, are truly referable to the sponges. As regards their distribution in space, the Antipathidae are principally inhabitants of warm seas, and are, therefore, most abundant in the neighbourhood of the equator. Several species are known from the Mediterranean; they have been found at various points in the North Atlantic; and they have even been recorded from the coasts of Greenland. They occur in depths of from 10 feet up to several hundred fathoms. As regards their distribution in time, the Antipathidae are not known to have come into existence during the Palaeozoic or Mesozoic period. They appear for the first time in the Miocene Tertiary, where they are represented by a single species (Leiopathes vetusta). Zoantharia sclerodermata (Madreporaria).— This group includes the majority of the coralligenous zoophytes of recent seas. They may be simple, consisting of a single polype only, or composite, consisting of many polypes united by a fleshy caenosarc. They always possess a corallum, which is partially or wholly developed within the tissues of the polypes themselves (“sclerodermic ”), which does not consist simply of scattered spicules, and in which the parts are so very generally disposed in multiples of six as to justify the name of Hexacoralla applied to the group.

The anatomy of the soft parts of the simple Zoantharia sclerodermata may be considered as practically identical with that of the Sea-Anemones; and the compound forms may be regarded as being essentially composed of a number of actinoid polypes united by a common flesh or caenosarc. It will, therefore, be unnecessary to treat here of more than the leading peculiarities of the hard parts, or “corallum,” from which these organisms derive their common name of “corals.”

An ordinary simple coral of this group may, then, be regarded as being essentially a Sea-Anemone, in which a more or less complicated skeleton has been developed. As in the Sea-Anemones, the animal possesses a column, a base, and a disc, the margin of the disc supporting the tentacles, and its centre being perforated by the aperture of the mouth. The mouth, often more or less proboscidiform, opens into a stomachal sac, the walls of which are connected with the parietes of the body by vertical folds of the mesoderm and endoderm (“mesenteries ”), and which communicates freely below with the general cavity of the body. Within the mesenteries are contained the reproductive organs; and the disc, with its tentacles and dependent gastric sac, is permanently soft and capable of retraction and expansion. Below the stomach the soft tissues of the animal are strengthened and supported by a more or less perfect calcareous skeleton or corallum. This is composed of calcareous matter (“sclerenchyma”) deposited by and in the tissues themselves, and the corallum is therefore within the polype, and is said to be “sclerodermic.” It is thus a true “tissue-secretion,” and differs very conspicuously from the “sclerobasis” of other Actinozoa (“ foot-secretion” of Dana), which is secreted by the caenosarc, and is not formed by a calcification of the soft parts of the polypes themselves. A typical simple corallum may be regarded as a cone, sometimes extremely depressed, sometimes so elongated as to be almost a cylinder, with an outer wall and an internal included space. The wall of the cone is known as the “theca,” and it may be very imperfect, or it may be covered externally more or less completely with a secondary calcareous investment (the “epitheca ”). The theca encloses a space which is known as the “visceral chamber,” is variously subdivided inferiorly, and superiorly presents itself as a shallower or deeper cup-shaped depression (the “calice ”). The centre of the calice is hollowed out for the reception and protection of the stomach-sac of the polype, but the theca generally rises round its margins nearly to the level of the disc. Below the calice the visceral chamber is divided into a series of vertical compartments (the “interseptal loculi ”) by a series of upright partitions or “septa,” which spring from the inner surface of the theca and are directed inwards towards the centre. The septa are of different breadths. Some of them are much wider than the others, and often extend far enough inwards to meet in the centre of the visceral chamber. These are the “primary septa;” but there are others which fall short of the centre by a greater or less distance, and these are known as the “secondary” and “tertiary” septa, according to their width. The centre of the visceral chamber may or may not be occupied by a variously-formed structure known as the “columella.” In its most typical form the columella is a calcareous rod, which extends from the bottom of the visceral chamber to the floor of the calice, [9:6:373] projecting upwards into the latter, and having the primary septa usually closely connected with it. The continuity of the interseptal loculi is often more or less broken up by the development of incomplete more or less horizontal plates, the “dissepiments,” which stretch from one septum to another; or the septa may be connected by numerous delicate cross-bars (“synaptîculae ”).

The above expresses the general features of the structure of a simple sclerodermic corallum, and it is easy to see that this structure owes its peculiarities to the fact that it has been produced by the calcification of the lower portion of a polype similar in its anatomy to an ordinary Sea-Anemone. Thus, the “theca” of the corallum corresponds to the column-wall of the polype, in the interior of which it is secreted. The “septa,” again, are developed within the mesenteries of the living animal, with which they correspond, and, like the mesenteries, they are “primary,” “secondary,” or “tertiary,” according as they reach the centre or fall short of it by a greater or less distance. It is to be recollected, however, that it is only the inferior portion of the polype which is thus hardened with carbonate of lime. The tentacular disc and mouth are placed at a level higher than the upper margin of the theca, and the digestive sac occupies the calice; whilst the whole of the space comprised within the theca is lined by the endoderm, and its outer surface is covered by the ectoderm.

Whilst the simple corallum is the skeleton of a single polype, the compoun<Psclerodermιc corallum is the aggregate skeleton composed by a colony of such polypes, and it varies in form according to the form and nature of the colony by which it is produced. Such a colony consists in general of a number of polypes united together by a common flesh or “coenosarc,” and corresponding elements are found in the corallum. Thus a compound coral consists generally of certain portions which are secreted by the individual polypes of the colony, and are known as the “corallites,” and of a common calcareous basis or tissue, which unites the various corallites into a whole, is secreted by the coenosarc, and is known as the “caenenchyma.” The latter element of a compound corallum is, however, by no means always present, the entire structure often consisting simply of the skeletons of the individual polypes (“corallites ”) united with one another directly and in different ways.

The compound coralla are, of course, primitively simple, and they become composite either by budding or by cleavage of the original polype. The principal methods in which this increase is effected in the Zoantharia scleroder'mata are the following :—

1. Lateral Gemmation.— In thia method of increase the original polype throws out buds from some point on its sides between the base and the circle of tentacles. The bud is at first simply a protuberance of the ectoderm and endoderm of the parent, containing in its interior a diverticulum of the somatic cavity; but a mouth and tentacles are developed at its distal extremity, mesenteries and septa appear in its interior, and it gradually assumes all the characters of the polype from which it was budded forth. Lateral or parietal gemmation generally gives rise to dendroid or arborescent coralla, as in the genera Madrepora, Dendrophyllia, Cladocora, Oculina, Lophohelia, &c., but the precise form of the resulting colony depends on the way in which the buds are given off, regularly or irregularly, singly or in numbers together, alternately or at opposite points, and also on the continuance or arrest of the growth of the parent. In other cases, where the parietal buds are given off from the edge of thecalice (“marginalgemmation”), the resulting corallum may become massive by the soldering together of the separate corallites, as occurs in the genus Astrocaenia, where the parent corallite continues to grow side by side with its buds.

2. Basal Gemmation.— In this mode of growth the original polype gives forth from its base a rudimentary coenosarc from which new buds are thrown up. Sometimes the coenosarc has the form of rootlike prolongations from which the buds are developed at intervals. More commonly, the coenosarc forms a more or less extensive horizontal expansion. The resulting form of corallum varies, being sometimes fasciculate, but more commonly massive or encrusting; and in all cases the youngest corallites are those which occupy the circumference of the mass. Good examples of the process of basilar gemmation are to be found in Rhizangia, Astrangia, &c.

3. Calicular Gemmation.— This consists in the production of buds from the calicine disc of the parent polype, which may or may not continue to grow thereafter. This mode of increase, though known to occur in forms like Isastraea, and some of the Montlivaltiae and Thccosmiliae, is very rare amongst the Zoantharia sclerodermata, and it may be doubted whether in certain cases it should not rather be regarded as a species of fission. Calicular gemmation, however, is seen in characteristic form amongst many Rugose corals, in treating of which it will be noticed at length.

4. Fission.— This consists in a process of spontaneous division or cleavage of the original polype into two individuals. This is usually effected by means of “oral cleavage,” the calicine disc of the parent polype becoming divided into two portions by a groove, which gradually deepens till the original mass is converted into two halves. The proximal extremity of the parent always remains undivided, and, according to Dana, the primitive mouth and stomach are appropriated by one of the halves produced by the fission, whilst a new mouth and stomach are developed in the other half. The form of corallum produced by fission varies in different cases. Sometimes the corallum becomes “caespitose” or tufted, consisting of a number of short diverging pairs of branches, each pair produced by the cleavage of a single corallite (e.g., Gaulastraeafi. In other cases the corallum becomes “massive,” the corallites produced by fission remaining permanently connected with one another. In other cases, again, the secondary corallites do not become perfectly separated from one another, their calices remaining more or less completely continuous, —often so much so as to give rise to one long calicine groove, with a long line of septa on each side, or to an aggregation of such grooves. By this “serial” growth the corallum becomes “gyrate” or “meandriue;” and excellent examples may be found in the genera Maeardrina, Diploria, Latimaeandra, Rhipidogyra, Pkytogyra, &c.

Finally, it should be noticed that, though the above mentioned modes of growth may be conveniently distinguished from one [9:6:374] another, they are nevertheless not unfrequently combined in the ⅛ιmβ individual. Thus, lateral may be combined with basal gemmation, and gemmation is commonly found accompanying fission.

It is next necessary to consider the different structures which compose the sclerodermic corallum in greater detail.

The general form of the corallum varies so much, that it is scarcely possible to make any statements on this subject except of an entirely general nature. The simplest corallum is most commonly cylindrical, conical, or turbinate (Cary ophy Ilia, Turbinolia, Balanophyllia, &c.), but it may be more or less compressed (Flabellum), discoidal (some species of Fungia), or concavo-convex. It may be rooted by its base to some foreign object, or it may be wholly free. The compound coralla are of the most varied shape. Commonly they are arborescent or dendroid (Madrepora, Dendrophyllia, Lophohelia, àc.); at other times they grow in clusters of branches springing from a common base (Massa, Caulastraea, and many species of Forties, Madrepora, <fcc.), the colony being “caespitose,” and convex on its distal aspect; others are “fasciculate,” or composed of numerous cylindrical corallites placed parallel with one another, or slightly diverging from the base (e.g., Calamophylliast ; others are massive and “astraeiform,” composed of polygonal corallites united with one another, and forming rounded, globular, hemispherical, or irregular masses (as in the typical Astraeidae); others are “foliaceous” (species of Madrepora, Pocillopora, Manopora, &c.); others, finally, are “encrusting” (e.g., some of the species of Manopora, Agaricia, &c.)

The “wall” (“muraille,” “eigentliche Wand ”) is the proper outer investment of the visceral chamber, whether we consider a simple corallum or take a single corallite in a compound corallum. The hard structures which are placed on the inside of the wall are the “endotheca,” whilst those which are developed exteriorly to the wall constitute what is collectively known as the “exotheca.” The condition of the wall varies greatly in different groups of the Zoantharia, being thick, compact, and impervious in some (Aporosa), and at other times more or less incomplete and pierced by larger or smaller apertures (Perforata). The surface of the wall may be smooth, or it may be marked with vertical ridges (costae), or by transverse striae or annulations of growth. Though often very distinctly recognizable, the wall may become so united with the caenenchyma as to be no longer determinable, or its place may be more or less completely taken by the epitheca.

The “epitheca ” is a secondary calcareous investment, which is very commonly developed in both simple and compound coralla, and is probably an integumentary secretion. In the simple coralla it is placed outside the proper wall, to which it may be closely applied, or from which it may be separated by the costae. It may be extremely thin, or very dense; and in the latter case its development is generally at the expense of the wall, which becomes so thin as to be often irrecognizable. It varies also in its extent, sometimes covering only the basal region of the coral, and at other times extending to the margin of the calice. It is generally marked with concentric striae and vertical ridges, often with accretions of growth, and it may give off spines or root-like processes of attachment. In the compound corals it is not unusual to find a well-developed epitheca enclosing the entire corallum below and on the sides, whilst each individual corallite is furnished with its own wall.

The external surface of the corallum often exhibits more or less prominent vertical ridges, which are known as the “costae.” The costae in a general way correspond with the septa in number and arrangement, and they usually appear, therefore, as so many prolongations of the septa outside the wall. It does not appear, however, that this is due to the septa being really continued through the wall so as to form the costae, but these structures would really seem to have an entirely independent origin. The projection of the costae from the wall is generally proportionate to the development of the septa to which they correspond, and there are great differences in different cases as to their size and distance apart. They may be ornamented with spines or tubercles, and they may be united by transverse plates (“exothecal dissepiments ”), which run horizontally across the intercostal spaces. Sometimes the costae, instead of corresponding with the septa, are placed opposite the interseptal loculi, and are thus seen to be really independent of the septa. In compound coralla the costae are often wanting when the corallites are amalgamated by their walls. In other cases the costae are greatly developed, and serve by their coalescence to unite the various corallites into a single colony.

The “calice” is the generally cup-shaped depression which is seen at the upper end of a corallum or of a single corallite of a compound mass, and which lodges the gastric sac of the animal in its living condition.

The “margin” of the calice is formed by the wall, and its “floor” is occupied by the septa, the interseptal loculi, and the central structures of the corallum. Though in general more or less cup-shaped and depressed, the calice may be prominent, and the septa may be produced beyond it (“exsert”). The outline of the calice is very different in different cases, though typically more or less circular; its depth is also extraordinarily variable; and its plane varies much in the angle which it forms with the axis of the corallum. The “se/>ía”(“cloisons,”“Längsscheidewände”), as previously noticed, are the vertical plates which radiate from the wall towards the centre and divide the visceral chamber into a series of vertical chambers or compartments (“interseptal loculi”). The septa correspond with the mesenteries of the living animal, within which they are developed, and the tentacles correspond each with an interseptal space. In their most rudimentary condition the septa appear simply as rows of spines or tubercles, but they in general present themselves as calcareous laminae, which can usually be shown to consist each of two closely apposed plates (in Dasmia of three), though often so thin and delicate as to appear single. When fully developed, a septum may be regarded as a somewhat triangular lamina, the base of which projects freely into the calice, whilst its outer margin is attached to the internal surface of the wall, and its inner margin is directed towards the centre of the visceral chamber, extending from the bottom of the coral to the floor of the calice, and being either free or united with certain other structures to be spoken of hereafter. Tho free edges of the septa are usually thin, and they may be plain or ornamented with spines, serrations, or granules. The parietal or attached edges of the septa are usually the thickest, but occasionally the septum widens out in the middle or centrally. The sides of the septa, looking into the interseptal loculi, may be smooth or may be ornamented with ridges, striae, papillae, or granules. The septa may be compact and imperforate, or they may be more or less porous and cribriform. Usually the various septa are quite independent of each other, but occasionally some of the smallest and latest formed septa may become inclined towards, and coalescent with, the larger and older septa.

The number of septa varies, but in none of the Zoantharia sclerodermata, in which septa are developed at all, are there found less than six septa in the adult corallum. Sometimes this number is permanently retained; sometimes twelve septa are present; most commonly the septa of the adult are over twelve in number. When there are more than six septa then their breadth varies, according as the mesenteries vary, and they thus become “primary,”[9:6:375] “secondary,” and “tertiary.” The chief facts which it is important to know about the development and arrangement of the septa are the following, taking the generally received views on this subject. At first six septa make their appearance simultaneously. These are the primary septa, and they may not be further added to. In other cases six additional and smaller secondary septa are next produced, one bisecting each of the six interseptal loculi between the primary septa; and this condition may also be permanently retained (Abveopora). In other cases twelve additional septa are produced in the now existing twelve interseptal loculi, one to each loculus, and these are the tertiary septa. In a corallum in which this last state of things was permanent, we should, therefore, find twenty-four septa in all, belonging to three orders or cycles, six septa of the first order, six of the second order, and twelve of the third order. Such a corallum has obviously twenty-four interseptal loculi, and we should imagine that the next order of septa (if developed at all) ought to consist of twenty-four septa bisecting these loculi. This is not the case, however, and any further orders of septa that may be produced are always twelve in number. If, therefore, a fourth order of septa be developed, it consists of twelve shorter septa intercalated in alternate interseptal loculi; whilst the loculi still vacant are filled by the development of twelve additional septa of the fifth order; the twenty-four septa thus produced collectively constituting the fourth cycle. The septa between each pair of primary septa constitute a system; and in the instance just taken there are forty-eight septa in all, arranged in five orders according to the time of their development, but only constituting four cycles of equally sized septa, and forming six systems of eight septa each. Each system contains the following orders: —
[table]

If a fifth cycle of septa be formed, then there are 96 septa, in six systems of sixteen septa each. Six cycles give 192 septa, and seven cycles produce 384; but it is far from common for these higher cycles to be completely developed.

The rule amongst the Zoantharia sclerodermata is that the septa are arranged in six systems, and are therefore, however numerous, some multiple of six; but this rule is not of universal application, and the typical hexameral arrangement may be departed from altogether. Thus, certain forms have the primary septa four, five, eight, or ten in number, and, therefore, have the septa of the adult arranged in a corresponding number of systems. It should be added that the researches of Lacaze<Duthiers have given rise to some doubt as to the above being truly the method in which the septa are successively developed. According to this observer the septa are developed before the wall (contrary to the received opinion), and are primitively twelve in number; but it seems clear that though this may be the case in the species examined by the French naturalist, it cannot be true of all the Zoantharia sclerodermata.

Between the internal edges of the septa and the axis of the visceral chamber there may exist a series of laminar processes to which the name of “pali” is given. The pali vary in number and size, and they may be developed internal to several orders of the septa, forming so many “crowns.” They are united by their outer edges with the inner edges of the septa, whilst their internal edges are free, or are united with the columella (if present).

The axis of the visceral chamber may be vacant and unoccupied, but it is very commonly filled by the structure known as the “columella.” The true or “essential” columella is an axial rod of a lamellar, compact, or fasciculate structure, extending from the bottom of the visceral chamber to the floor of the calice, into which it projects, and formed independently of the septa. The septa may or may not be, some of them, attached by their inner ends tocthe columella, or there may be pali attached to it. A “parietal” or “septal” columella may be formed by the coalescence in different ways of the inner edges of the septa, which divide and inosculate so as to form a spongy or cellular central structure. In other cases a “pseudo-columella” may be produced by the twisting together of the inner ends of a certain number of the septa.

The continuity of the interseptal loculi is liable to be more or less interfered with by the development of the endothecal structures known as the dissepiments, synapticulae, and tabulae. The “dissepiments" (“traverses ”) are incomplete, approximately horizontal plates, which stretch between adjacent septa, and break up the interseptal loculi into secondary compartments or cells. They may be absent, or rudimentary, or they may be so greatly developed as to render a greater or less portion of the corallum completely “vesicular,” in the vicinity of the wall more especially.

The “ tabuloe ” (“planchers,” “Boden ”) may be regarded as highly developed dissepiments, and like them are approximately horizontal, as a rule at any rate. They differ from the dissepiments in cutting across the interseptal loculi at the same level. When completely developed they extend right across the visceral chamber, and divide it into a series of stories placed one above the other, the only living portion of the corallum being that above the last formed tabula. They may, however, be present only in the central portion of the corallum, or they may spring from the wall, but not extend across the visceral chamber. Tabulae may exist in conjunction with well-developed septa (Alυeopo,ra), or the septa may be rudimentary or absent (Halysites, Favosites).

The “synapticulae ” are transverse calcareous bars which stretch across the interseptal loculi, like a kind of trelliswork. They are formed by papillae developed on the opposite faces of adjacent septa, coalescing with one another in the middle of the interseptal loculi. In other cases they may be so greatly developed as to constitute elongated ridges between the septa. They are characteristic of the Fungidae.

In compound coralla the various corallites of the colony are often united together by a common calcareous tissue, which is known as the “caenenchymafi and which varies very much in texture, being sometimes loose and spongy (e.g., Madreporidae), at other times dense and compact. (e.g., Oculinidae). In other cases the caenenchyma is absent or rudimentary (Astraeidae, Turbinolidae), and the corallites are then united together in different ways. In some of the arborescent and fasciculate coralla the corallites are only united with one another at the points where they are budded out; but in other cases (Syringopora, for example) they may be united by horizontal outgrowths.
[9:6:376]

Sometimes the corallites are simply in contact with one another, or their walls may be fused together, in which case there is a great tendency for the calices to become polygonal by mutual pressure. In other cases, again, the corallites are united together by the great development and coalescence of the costae.

The Zoantharia sclerodermata were divided by Milne-Edwards and Jules Haime into the four great sections of the Aporosa, Perforata, Tabulata, and Tubulosa. The first two of these groups constitute large, important, and natural divisions, whilst the two latter are of doubtful affinities and uncertain value.

(1.) The Aporosa are characterized by the fact that the calcareous tissue of the corallum is more or less compact and imperforate; the septa are well developed, and usually constitute complete lamellae; while the walls are generally quite complete, and, as a rule, are not pierced by any apertures. Dissepiments or synapticulae are usually present, but tabulae are rarely developed. This section includes the most highly developed of existing corals, and it is subdivided by Milne-Edwards and Haime into six families:—

a. Turbιnolidx.-Coτa ∖∖ ∞Λ simple or compound, but never possessing a caenenchyma; septa well developed, usually regularly granulated on the two βides, but their free edges not denticulated; interseptal loculi open and free from dissepiments or synapticulae; costae well marked and straight; wail imperforate. The principal genera of this family are Bathycyathus, Brachycyathus, Trochocyathus, Leptocyathus, Tħecocyathus, Discocyathus, Cyclocyathus, Paracyathus, Deltocyathus, Placocyathus, Turbinolta, Sphenotrochus, Platytrochus, Ceratotrochus, Discotrochus, Placotrochus, Blastotrochus, Rhizotrochus, Onchotrochus, Desmophyllum, and Flabellum. b. Pseudoturbinolidae.— Corallum simple, resembling that of the preceding in most respects, but having the septa composed of three laminae each, which are free internally, but are united externally by a single costa. The only genus of this group is the extinct Dasmia. e. Oculinidae.— Corallum compound; caenenchyma abundant, compact, its surface smooth or striated, but not echinulate-, walls imperforate, the lower part of the corallites becoming filled up in advancing age; dissepiments scanty; no synapticulae; occasionally tabulae. The principal genera of this family are 0culιna, Cyathohelia, Astrohelia, Synhelia, Lopholιeha, Amphihelia, Diplohelia, Axohelia, Cryptohelia, Endohelιa, Slylaster, Stylophora, Dendracis, Orbicella, Pocillopora, and Seriatopora (?) d. Astrxidae.— Corallum simple or compound, usually increasing by fission; walls perfect and Imperforate; caenenchyma absent, or if present lax; interseptal dissepiments abundantly developed, no synapticulae nor tabulae. The principal genera of this family are Placosmilia, Trochosmilia, Parasmilia, Eusmilia, Thecosmilia, Barysmilia, Diplocteniuιn, Montliυaltia, Dendrogyra, Rhipidogyra, Pachygyra, Stylina, Astrocoenia, Stephanocaenia, Phyllocoema, Dichoc<xnia, Heterocaenia, Sarcinula, Caryophyllia, Lobophyllia, Rhabdophylha, ¢ladophyllia. Symphyllia, Oulophylha, Calamophyllia, Eunomia, Latιmeandra, Meandrina, Diplorta, Leptona, Manicina, Cladocora, Favia, Ooniocora, Mussa, Pleurocora, Astrxa, Oulastraea, Leptastraea, Solenastraea, Prionastraea, Sider-astraea, Septastrxa, Isastraea, Synastraea, Thamnastraea, Goniastrxa, Astroides, Angia, Cryptangia, Rhizangia, Astrangιa, Phyllangta, 0ulangia, Echinopora, Battersbyia, and Heterophyllia. e. Pseudofungidae.— Corallum compound, the basal plate or wall perforated (as in the Fungidae), but the corallites without synapticulae and with interseptal dissepiments (as in the Astrxidae'). The only genus of this family is Λferulιna. f. Fungidx.— Corallum simple or compound, usually discoidal or laminar; the calice shallow and open at its sides in the simple forms, confluent and not circumscribed in the compound forms, septa complete, coalescent with the costae, imperforate, their edges dentate, and their sides echinulate or furnis⅛ed with synapticulae; wall basal, generally perforated; no dissepiments, nor tabulae. The chief genera of this family are Cyclolιtes, Fungia, Ctenactis, Mtcra-bacia, Anabacia, Cryptobacia, Cycloseris, Trochoseris, Cyathoseris, Comoseris, Protoseris, Lophoseris, Agaricia, Pachyseris, Leptoseris, and Phyllastraea.

(2.) The Perforata are distinguished by the fact that the calcareous tissue of the corallum is more or less porous, loosely aggregated, spongy, or reticulate, the walls in all being perforated with more or fewer apertures. The septa are generally well developed, but may be represented only by trabeculae. The visceral chamber is usually more or less completely open from top to bottom, but there may be imperfect dissepiments, and in some cases well-developed tabulae are present. The section Perforata comprises the following families :-

a. Eupsammidae. —Corallum simple or compound; septa well developed, lamellar, for the most part perforated; a spongy columella is present; walls perforated, granular, sub-costulate, often thickened with age. Septa numerous, those of the last cycle bent towards those of the penultimate cycle, so as to produce the appearance of a six or twelve-branched star; interseptal loculi open, or only with a few dissepiments; costae rudimentary. The chief genera of this family are Eupsammia Endopachys, Balanopħyllia, Heteropsammia, Lobopsammia, C<xnopsammιa, Stereopsammia, Stephanophyllía, and Dendrophyllia. b Madreporidae.— Corallum compound, increasing by gemmation; caenenchyma abundant, spongy, and reticulate; walls porous, not distinct from the caenenchyma; septa often well developed; no synapticulae, and, generally speaking, no dissepiments, but occasionally tabulae. (The diagnosis of this family may require amendment for the reception of the Favositidae proper). The chief genera of this family are Madrepora, Explanaria, Astrteopora, Turbinaria, Palaeacis, Λlveopora, Favositopora, and Columnopora (?) c. Poritidae.— Corallum wholly composed of reticulate sclerenchyma; septa well developed, but only composed of styliform processes, which by their junction form a kind of irregular lattice-work. Walls reticulate, not distinct from the sclerenchyma; a few dissepiments, but no tabulae. The principal genera of this family are Porites, Litharaea, Coscinaraea, Rhodaraea, Poraraea, Protaraea, Mìcroso-lena, Gontopora, Montiρora, and Psammocora.

(3. ) The Tabulata constitute a group founded by Milne-Edwards and Haime for the reception of a number of corals essentially characterized by the rudimentary condition or absence of septa, conjoined with the presence of well-developed tabulae dividing the visceral chamber into so many distinct stories. Recent researches, however, by Agassiz, Verrill, Lindstrom, Duncan, Dollfus, Moseley, and others, have clearly shown that the old order Tabulata is a heterogeneous assemblage, comprising forms of very different zoological affinities, and that it must be broken up and redistributed, or greatly restricted. It has been unequivocally shown, in fact, that the presence of tabulae cannot, of itself, be regarded as a point of high classificatory value, since these structures occur in forms in other respects no way related to each other. Thus, tabulae occur in Pocillopora, Cyathophora, and occasionally in Loplιohelia amongst the Aporosa, in Alvcopora and Favositopora amongst the Perforata, in Heliopora amongst the Alcyonaria, in the great majority of the Rugosa, andin certain of the Polyzoa (e.g., Radiopora and Hetaerodictya). It has also been shown that some of the so-called “tabulate corals” are not Actinozoa at all, but that they belong to the Molluscan order of the Polyzoa; and good authorities believe that this is the true position of a very large number of the forms previously included under this head. The whole of this subject is at present under investigation, and the ultimate results of the inquiry are uncertain. It will, therefore, be sufficient here to indicate the views which are now generally entertained as to the true affinities of the principal forms included by Milne-Edwards and Haime amongst the Tabulata.

The affinities of the great and important reef-building genus, Millepora, are still not absolutely settled. By Professor Louis Agassiz it was taken out of the true corals and placed amongst the Hydrozoa, and the most recent researches of Mr Mosely upon the living animal appear to corroborate this view. According to this observer, the spongy corallum is composed of calcareous trabeculae disposed in layers concentric with the surface of the mass, and there is the unique feature that these layers are penetrated by a series of ramifying and anastomosing canals, which communicate with the calicular cavities. There are two kinds of calices in the species examined, large and small, the former being surrounded each by a ring of the latter. The polypes, or zooids, are of two kinds, the larger ones, occupying the large calices, having a mouth and from four to six knobbed tentacles. The smaller zooids are more slender, have no mouth, and have from five to twenty tentacles. Mr Mosely appears to consider that the structure of Millepora, as examined by him, is Hydrozoan; but a recent investigation carried out, on the other hand, by Major-General Nelson and Professor Martin Duncan leads these authors to the opinion that Millepora is really Alcιjonarian, and therefore truly referable to the Actinozoa.

The genus Heliopora has recently been examined by Mosely in its living condition, and it has been shown to be [9:6:377] Alcyonarian and not Zoantharian. With Heliopora must unquestionably be placed the extinct genera Heliolites, Plasmopora, Lyeilia, and Polytremacis, all of which have an essentially tubular and tabulate caenenchyma, the corallites having tabulae and more or less distinct pseudosepta. These, therefore, must also be removed to the Alcyonaria. The genus Pocillopora, as shown by Verrill, is a true Zoantharian, belonging to the Aporosa, and apparently referable to the Oculinidae. Seriatopora, though still imperfectly known, may with great probability be placed in the immediate neighbourhood of Pocillopora; and Rhabdopora and Trachypora may be provisionally grouped along with it. The genus Axopora, with its great columella, its reticulate sclerenchyma, and its want of septa, is in an extremely uncertain position, but may possibly be Alcyonarian.

There remain four groups of the Tabulata, which are in themselves well marked, but which are still in a doubtful position. The first c∙f these is the group of the Favositidae (comprising Favosites, Em - nonsia, Michelinia, Koninckia, Striatopora, Alveolites, &c), in which the septa are rudimentary or absent, the tabulae are extremely well developed, and the walls are perforated more or less freely with mural pores. Their septa (when present at all) may be only pseudosepta, like those of the genus Heliopora, and these forms may perhaps be Alcyonaria. In their perforated walls, however, they closely resemble the recent genera Alveopora and Favositopora, and their true affinities would thus seem to be rather with the Madreporidae in the Zoantharia perforata. This view is further supported by the occurrence of genera like Columnopora, in which the perforated walls and tabulate corallites are associated with comparatively well-developed septa. Another group is that of the Chaetetidae (comprising Chaetetes, Monticulipora, Dania, Constellaria, &c., and probably Fistulipora, Callopora, and some allied forms), in which the walls of the corallites are imperforate, the tabulae are well developed, and there are no traces of septa. This group is in a most uncertain position, it being an open question whether it should be referred to the Alcyonaria, the Polyzoa, or the Hydrozoa, or whether it can be retained in the Zoantharia. Though often associated with the Favositidae, it seems certain that there is little true relationship between the two groups; and the most probable view is perhaps the one which refers the Chaetetidae to the A lcyonaria. The genus Labechia has not been examined in sufficient detail to render its reference to this group at all certain. A third group is that of the Thccidae, comprising the single genus Thecia, in which the corallites have no true Avail, but the costae are greatly developed, and are so filled up as to constitute a dense caenenchyma. The affinities of this group are quite uncertain, though it may be regarded with some probability as belonging to the Alcyonaria. Lastly, there is a fourth group, comprising the genera Haly sites, Syringopora, Chonostegitcs, and Thecostegites, with probably Flctcheria and Beaumontia, in which there are rudimentary septa (typically twelve in number), well developed tabulae, and imperforate walls. 1 n Syringopora, though the walls are compact, the visceral chambers of contiguous corallites are placed in communication by means of tubular connecting processes, and there is thus a decided approach to the structure of the Favositidae on the one hand, whilst, on the other hand, the genus in some respects is nearly allied to Aulopora. The other genera of this group have no communication between their corallites. If any forms can be retained to constitutea “tabulate” order of the Zoantharia, it would seem to be these; but it is not possible at present to come to any decided conclusion on this point.

(4). The Tubulosa constitute a small group, including principally the genera Aulopora and Pyrgia, to which perhaps Clado-ehonus ana Stomatopora should be added. The corallum in this group is simple (Pyrgia) or compound (Aulopord), the corallites in the latter case being united by a creeping and branched caenenchyma. The thecae are trumpet-shaped, tubular or pyriform, without tabulae, and having the septa indicated by mere striae on the inner surface of the wall. The affinities of this group are very doubtful, and it seems questionable if it can be retained in the Zoantharia. In some respects the forms included under this head show points of relationship with the Cyclostomatous Polyzoa, such as Alecto; but it seems more probable that they are really Actinozoa, and perhaps referable to the Alcyonaria.

As regards their distribution in space, the Zoantharia sclerodermata are, like the other members of the Actinozoa, exclusively marine. They are very widely distributed over the globe, occurring in all seas except the coldest, but attaining their maximum development in warm regions. They may convenaently be regarded under two heads—the one comprising the “solitary” corals, whether simple or compound, the other comprising the “reef-building'’ corals. The former do not constitute the great aggregations of coral which are known as “reefs,” and though some of the compound forms may, as individuals, attain a large size, they are destitute of the loose cellular caenenchyma of so many of the reefbuilders, and thus do not tend to increase indefinitely in dimensions. The solitary corals, further, are essentially and principally deep-sea forms, only rarely found in the littoral zone, or at extreme low water, abounding most in depths of from 10 to 200 fathoms, and extending their range even to depths of from 500 to over 1500 fathoms. They may, as already remarked, be either simple or compound, and amongst the more important recent genera which are solely, or chiefly, deep-water forms, may be mentioned Caryophyllia (rarely found in the littoral zone), Balanophyllia, Flabellum, Sphenotrochus, Paracyathus, Desmophyllum, Lobopsammia, Thecopsammia, Dendro- phyllia, Allopora, 0culina, Lophohelia, and Amphihelia. Coral Reefs.

The “reef-building” corals are essentially shallow-water forms, flourishing between extreme low-water mark and depths of from 20 to 25 fathoms. By their continued growth and aggregation they give rise to the great banks of coral which are known as “coral-reefs,” the compound species often possessing a lax cellular caenenchyma, enabling them to increase almost indefinitely in size. In other cases they increase rapidly by spontaneous fission. Amongst the more important reef-building corals of the present day may be mentioned the Astraeidae generally (Astraea, Meandrina, Diploria, Astrangia, Cladocora, <fcc.), the Madreporidae (Madrepora, &c.), the Poritidae (Pointes, Goniopora, Montipora, <fcc.), many of the Oculinvìae (Orbicella, Sty last er, Pocillopora, &c.), the majority of the Fungidae (two species of Fungia inhabit deep water), and the Millepores. Though principally formed by corals belonging to the Zoantharia sclerodermata, the growth of coral-reefs is further con tributed to by various Alcyonoid corals (Hêliopora, Tubipora, and numerous forms belonging to the Gorgonidae), and by the calcareous algae (Nullipores and Corallines).

The distribution of the reef-building corals seems to depend mainly upon the mean winter temperature of the sea, and they are confined to seas in which the temperature of the water during the winter does not sink on an average below 66° or 68° Fahr. The seas thus limited may be said to be comprised within a distance of about 1800 miles on either side of the equator. Even within these limits, however, apparently owing to the influence of Arctic currents, no coral-reefs are found on the western coasts of Africa and South America. The metropolis of the reef-building corals may be said to be the central Pacific Ocean, with its numerous islands and masses of continental land; [9:6:378] but reefs are also found more or less largely developed in the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, the coasts of Zanzibar, Madagascar, and Mauritius, the Gulf of Panama, the coast of Brazil, around the West Indian Islands and the shores of Florida,and around the Bermudas. According to the classification of Darwin, which is essentially the same as that adopted by other authorities, coral-reefs may be separated into three principal groups, viz.: Fringing-reefs, Barrier-reefs, and Atolls. Fringing∙τeefs are shallow-water reefs, found in the immediate neighbourhood of land, either surrounding islands or skirting the shores of continents. These shore-reefs have no channel of any great depth of water intervening between them and the land, and the soundings on their sea-ward margin indicate that they repose upon a gently-sloping surface. Barrier-reefs, like the preceding, may either encircle islands or skirt continents. They are distinguished from Fringing-reefs by the fact that they are placed at a much greater distance from the land, that there intervenes a channel of comparatively deep water between them and the shore, and that soundings taken close to their seaward margin indicate profound depths of water outside them. The Barrier-reefs which surround islands are termed “encircling Barrier-reefs,” and they occasionally form a complete ring, though more usually discontinuous and broken at intervals. The Barrier-reefs which skirt continents attain a greater size. As an example of these may be taken the succession of reefs which form the great “barrier” on the north-east coast of Australia. These run, with occasional breaches in their continuity, for a distance of over 1000 miles, their average distance from the shore being between 20 and 30 miles, the depth of the inner channel being from 10 to 60 fathoms, and the sea outside being sometimes over 2000 feet in depth.

Atolls are ring-shaped reefs usually oval or circular in form, which enclose a central expanse of water or lagoon, without any land. Occasionally (as in Whitsunday Island) the entire circle of the Atoll may have been raised above the water. More commonly the ring is not complete, but is breached by one or more openings, which are always placed on the leeward side of the Atoll, or on the side most completely sheltered from, the prevailing winds. In their structure Atolls are identical with “encircling Barrier-reefs,” from which they differ only in the fact that the lagoon which they enclose does not contain an island in its centre.

Many coral-reefs are constantly submerged below the sea, and are not laid bare even at extreme low water; others are exposed to view by the recession of the tide, and are covered at high water; others, again, are partially raised above the level of the highest tides, and thus constitute dry land. If we examine a reef of the last class—say a portion of an Atoll or an encircling Barrier-reef—the following are the general phenomena which may be noticed. The general form of the reef is approximately triangular, as seen, in section, with a steep and abrupt seaward face, and a long and gentle slope towards the inner lagoon or channel. The extreme outer margin of the reef is the only portion of the whole which is composed of actually living coral, and this part is not exposed to view even at extreme low water. Soundings outside this line always indicate a more or less considerable depth of water, and the outer margin of the reef is usually exposed to the beating of a tremendous surf, in which the coral-polypes find their most congenial home. Immediately inside the line of breakers is a broader or narrower platform of dead coral and coralrock, which is only laid bare at low water, and which may be bounded internally by a ledge of brecciated coral-rock only reached by the waves at high water. Finally, the inner portion of the reef rises to the height of a few feet above the level of high water, and constitutes dry land. It is composed of blocks of coral more or less completely cemented together by the percolation of water holding carbonate of lime in solution, along with blown sand derived from the disintegration of the coral. The land generally bears a luxuriant vegetation, and slopes with a prolonged and gentle inclination to the inner lagoon. The beach of the Atoll is covered with coral-sand, and with fragments of coral, which are often cemented together by the percolation of water so as to form compact oolitic or brecciated limestones. The bottom of the inner lagoon usually supports many living corals, along with accumulations of fine chalky mud, apparently largely formed from the excreta of animals, which, like the Scari and Holothurians, feed upon the living corals. Outside the reef, at depths greater than 25 fathoms, the bottom seems to be covered with coral-sand and dead coral.

The general method of formation of a coral-reef becomes readily intelligible on a consideration of the conditions which are requisite for the existence and welfare of the coral-polypes. The reef-building corals, in the first place, flourish most vigorously in depths up to 10 fathoms, and appear to be incapable of existing at all at depths exceeding 25, or at the utmost 30 fathoms. It follows from this that no coral-reef can begin to be formed on a sea-bottom covered by more than 30 fathoms of water. In the case, however, of Atolls and Barrier-reefs, we have reefs rising out of profound depths, soundings on their seaward margin indicating depths of from 100 up to more than 1000 fathoms, at points not far removed from the actual edge of the reef. Originally it was believed that the reef had been raised from these great depths to the surface by the exertions of the polypes themselves; but the extremely limited bathymetrical range of these animals renders this view wholly untenable. The true explanation of this problem was first afforded by the masterly researches of Mr Darwin, who showed that the production of Barrier-reefs and Atolls is really to be ascribed to the subsidence by slow degrees of the foundations on which they rest. Thus a Fringing-reef surrounding an island may be formed in depths of from 10 to 15 fathoms, and may grow till it reaches the level of low water. If, now, such a reef be supposed to sink gradually beneath the sea by a sufficiently slow subsidence, the upward growth of the corals will neutralize the downward movement of the land, so that the reef will appear to be stationary, whilst it is really growing upwards. Whilst the reef will remain to all appearance unaffected in its form, position, and size, the island which it surrounds will gradually diminish in size as the subsidence goes on, and a wide and deep channel will be formed between it and the reef. If the depression should be continued still further, the island will be reduced to a mere peak in the centre of a lagoon, and the reef, from a “Fringing-reef,” will have become converted into an “encircling Barrier-reef.” Simultaneously, we should find that there is now deep water all round the reef, on its [9:6:379] outer margins; for the coral-polypes grow principally in a vertical direction, so that the width of the reef can be little or not at all greater than the width of its original base. If the depression of the land be still further continued, the central island will ultimately disappear altogether, and the reef will become an oval or circular ring, usually more or less incomplete, and perhaps 30, 40, or 50 miles in diameter, enclosing a central expanse of water or lagoon. It is thus seen that Fringing-reefs, Barrier-reefs, and Atolls are different stages of the same thing, the latter being produced out of the former by the progressive subsidence of the land. In order, however, that this process should be carried out, it is necessary that the rate of subsidence should not be more rapid than the rate of upward growth of the corals. If it should be so, then the reef is carried down into deep water, and becomes submerged, as is the case, for example, with the great Chagos Bank. In accordance with Mr Darwin’s theory on this subject, it is found that Barrierreefs and Atolls do not occur in the immediate vicinity of active volcanoes—regions where geology teaches us that the land is either stationary, or is undergoing slow upheaval. On the other hand, the existence of Fringing-reefs is only possible wsliere the land is either slowly rising, or is stationary; and, as a matter of fact, Fringing-reefs are often found to be conjoined with upraised strata of post-Tertiary age. As regards their upward limits of growth, again, the coral-polypes cannot exist on levels higher than extreme low water, exposure to the sun, even for a short period, proving generally, if not invariably, fatal. The coral-polypes, therefore, can raise the reef to the level of extreme low water, but no further; and it is to the denuding power of the ocean that the elevation of the reef above this level is due. The breakers which fall upon the outer edge of the reef detach masses of dead coral, often of very large size, and these become gradually accumulated at particular spots, till they rise above the level of high water. The detached masses, thus heaped up, become compacted together by the finer sediment of the reef, and agglutinated by the percolation through them of water holding carbonate of lime in solution, till they become ultimately converted into a hard compact limestone. The new land produced in this way is protected from destruction by the vital activity of the living corals, which occupy a fringe at the outermost margin of the reef just below the level of extreme low water, and which by their continual growth preserve the inner parts of the reef from the waves.

Another condition very essential to the welfare of the coral-polypes is an abundant supply of pure and properly aerated water. They flourish, therefore, in their highest vigour at the extreme outer edge of the reef, and on its windward side, where they are exposed to the constant beating of the surge; and hence it is that the growth of the reef is principally carried on at these points. Mud and sediment are, on the other hand, very injurious to corals, and they rarely occur, therefore, on sandy or muddy bottoms. It is for this reason, also, as much probably as from the pernicious effect of an intermixture of fresh water, that openings in coral-reefs are always found to exist at points opposite the mouths of rivers. It has been shown, however, by experiment, that corals will flourish on a sandy bottom provided the water is free from sediment in suspension.

As regards the distribution in time of the Zoantharia sclerodermata, the distinction which obtains at the present day between the solitary and the reef-building corals is found to have subsisted in the past, so far at any rate as the Tertiary and Secondary periods are concerned. Thus the solitary and essentially deep-sea forms are represented in the Kainozoic and Mesozoic deposits by forms such as Sphenotrochus, Flabellum, Bala.nophyllia, Turbinolia, Leptocyathus, Trochocyathus, Paracyathus, 0culina, Diplohelia, Astrohelia, Stephanophyllia, Stcreopsammia, Parasmilia, Trocho- smilia, Thecosmilia, Montlivaltia, Dendrophyllia, de. On the other hand, the reef-building and essentially shallow-water forms are represented by such genera as Madrepora, Axopora, Porites, Litharaea, Solcnastraea, Isastrcca, Septastraea, Dendracis, Astrocaenia, Stylocaenia, &c.

Taken as a whole, the Zoantharia sderodermata\ìns¢ attained their maximum of development at the present day, being largely represented in the Tertiary and Secondary periods, but having their place to a great extent usurped in the Palaeozoic period by the Rugose Corals. The Aporosa are onlyrepresentedwithcertaintyinthe Palaeozoic series by the two remarkable genera Battersbyia and Heterophyllia, which form an aberrant group of the Astraeidae (Palastraeidae), and of which the former is Devonian, whilst the latter is Carboniferous. The Silurian genus Palaeocyclus was formerly regarded as belonging to the Fungidae, but it is a genuine Rugose Coral. The genus Duncanella, of the Upper Silurian, may perhaps belong to the Turbinolidae, and this may very probably be the true position of some of the corals referred to the genus Petraia, of the Silurian and Devonian. The genus Columnaria (Favistella) may perhaps also be referred to the Astraeidae. In the Permian rocks no Aporosa are known to have existed, the whole of this formation, as well as the greater portion of the Trias, being singularly destitute of remains of corals. Towards the summit of the Triassic series, however, in the St Cassian beds, we find a great development of the Aporosa, which are now represented by a number of Astraeidae, belonging to well-known Secondary types, such as Montlivaltia, Thecosmilia, Cladophyllia, Rhabdophyllia, Goniocora, Isastraea, Thamnastraea, Elysastraea, Latimeandra, and Astrocaenia. In the succeeding formation of the Lias the Astraeidae are represented by all the genera just mentioned, along with others such as Septastraea, Stylastraea, Cyathocaenia, Oppelismilia, and Lepido- phyllia, whilst the Turbinolidae are now represented for the first time {Thecocyathus). In the great series of the Oolites, we still find an enormous preponderance of forms belonging to the Astraeidae, the principal genera of this period being Isastraea, Thamnastraea, Septastraea, Clausastraea, Convexastraea, Heliastraea, Fleurosmilia, Peplosmilia, Blastosmiïia, Aplosmilia, Stylosmilia, Thecosmilia, Astrocaenia, Stephanocaenia, Bhabdophyllia, Cladophyllia, Calamophyllia, Baryphyllia, Sty Una, Goniocora, Latimeandra, Cyathophora, Montlivaltia, Bhipidogyra, Pachygyra, Dendrogyra, Phytogyra, Favia, &c. The Turbinolidae are represented in the Oolites by genera such as Discocyathus, Trochocyathus, and Thecocyathus; the Oculinidae appear under forms such as Stylophora, Euhelia, Ènallohelia, Psammohclia, Ac.; whilst the Funaidae are lareelv represented bv species of Comoseris.
[9:6:380]

Protosms, Dimorsihoscris, Oroscris, Anobacia, Genabaaeia, kc. In the Cretaceous period the proportions of the different families of the Aporosa are much the same as in the Oolitic. The Astraeidae are still by far the most numerous, the principal Cretaceous genera being Thamnastraea, Synastraea, Goniastraea, Isastraea, Heliaaetraea, Cyphaaetraea, Barysmilia, Trochosmilia, Placosmilia, Paraaemilia, Pcplosmilia, Diρloctenium, Phyllocaenia, Cryptocaenia, Astrocaenia, Stylocaenia, Ccntrocaenia, Pleurocora, Cladocora, Hydnophora, Caryophyllin, Brachyphyllia, Favia, Cyathophora, Meandrina, Latimeandra, Diploria, Lcptoria, Stclloria, Rhipidogyra, Eugyra, Pachygyra, Montlivaltia, Rhizangia, &c. The Turbinolidae are represented by species of Trochocyathus, Leptocyathus, Brachy-cyathuae, Cydocyathus, Smilotrochus, Stylotrochus, Onchotrochus, &c.; and the Pseudoturbinolidae by the genus Dasmia. Amongst the Oculinidae we meet with such genera as Synhelia and Diblaaeus; and the family of the Fungidae is well represented by species of Cyclolites, Micrabacia, Cycloseris, Podoseris, Cyathoscris, Trocho-aeeriae, Oroscris, and Turbinoscris. The Cretaceous corals are not separated from those of the Eocene period by any break similar in extent to that which separates the coral-fauna of the later Palaeozoic rocks from that of the younger Mesozoic; but there is nevertheless a considerable difference observable. The Astraeidae are no longer so abundant, and are represented by genera such as Solenaaetraea, Astraea, Hcliaaetraea, Montlivaltia, Stephanocaenia, Phyllocaenia, Astrocaenia, Stylocaenia, Parasmilia, Caelosmilia, Cylicosmilia, Rhizangia, Dasyphyllia, Circophyllia, Latimeandra, Hydnophora, &c. The Turbinolidae are greatly developed, and are represented by numerous genera, such as Turbinolia, Trochocyathus, Leptocyathus, Paracyathuae, Flabellum, Platytrochus, Discotrochus, Sphenotrochuae, &c. The Pseudoturbinolidae are represented by the genus Dasmia, which dies out here. Amongst the Oculinidae, we meet with the genus Oculina itself, along with species of Diplohelia, Stylophora, &c. Lastly, the Fungidae are represented by forms such as Cyathoseris, Trochoseris, and Cyclolites. In deposits of Miocene age, the Astraeidae are represented by the genera Astraea, Prionastraea, Plesiastraea, Solenaaetraea, Septa-aetraea, Astrocaenia, Caryophyllia, Lithophyllia, Montlivaltia, Hydnophora, Cladocora, Trochosmilia, Diploctenium, Rhizangia, Phyllangia, Cryptangia, Cladangia, &c. Amongst the Miocene Turbinolidae are the genera Trochocyathus, Dcltocyathus, Acantho-cyathus, Sphenotrochuae, Ceratotrochus, I)esmoρhyllum, and Flabellum ; whilst the Oculinidae are represented 1 >y species of Oculina, Diplohaelia, Astrohelia, and ∙ Stylophora, and for the first time Pocillopora. The Fungidae, finally, are poorly represented by the genus Cyclolites. The Pliocene deposits have hitherto yielded a small number of corals, belonging to solitary forms, the Astraeidae being represented by Caryophyllia, Cryptangia, <⅛c., the Oculinidae by Oculina itself, and the Turbinolidae by forms such as Flabellum, Sphenotrochus, and Paracyathuae.

The geological history of the great group of the Perforata is shorter and less perfectly known than that of the Aporosa. Leaving out of sight forms of uncertain affinities, the Perforata are but represented in the great pile of Palaeozoic deposits by some two or three genera, and they are absent or very poorly represented in all the lower Mesozoic sediments. In the Cretaceous period they for the first time begin to be more abundant, though still sparsely developed, and it is not till the commencement of the Tertiary period that this group assumes anything like its present proportions. In the vast series of Silurian deposits the Perforate corals are only represented by two undoubted genera, namely the Protaraea of the Lower Silurian, which belongs to the Poritidae, and is nearly allied to the genus Lüharaea, and the singular Calostylis of the Upper Silurian. The Lower Silurian genus Columñopora may perhaps be referred to the Madreporidae, and if the Favositidae were ultimately referred to the same family, then we should have to admit a very considerable development of the Perforata in Upper Silurian times. In the succeeding period of the Devonian, rich as it is in corals, no certain representative of the Perforata is known. The genus Pleurodictyum has been referred here, but is apparently founded upon casts of Favosites. In the great coralliferous deposits of the Carboniferous, again, no representative of the group is known, save the single genus Palaeacis, which appears to be a Madreporacean. In the Permian rocks, the Trias, and the Lias, no single example of a Perforate coral has hitherto been brought to light, and the group is represented in the Oolitic series by the single genus Microsolena, an aberrant member of the Poritidae. In the Cretaceous series the Perforate corals are represented by members of all the existing families, Stephanophyllia amongst the Eupsammidae, Porites amongst the Poritidae, and Actinads amongst the Madreporidae. In the Eocene rocks a jpuch more striking development of the Perforata takes place. The Eupsammidae are now represented by Èupsammia, Stereo- psamτnia, Lobopsammia, Endopachys, Balanophyllia, Stephanophyllia, Dendrophyllia, kc. The Madreporidae appear under such forms as Madrepora, Alυcopora, Astraeopora, and Dendracis; and the Poritidae are represente<l by such genera as Porites and Litharaea. In the Miocene period the Eupsammidae are represented by Balanophyllia, Stcphanophyllia, Dendrophyllia, Eupsammia, kc., the Madreporidae by Madrepora and Tur binaria, and the Poritidae by Porites and Rhodaraea. In the Pliocene period the Perforata appear to be principally represented by Eupsammidae, such as Balanophyllia, Stephanophyllia, Dendrophyllia, and Caeno-psammia.

In discussing the geological distribution of the Tabulate Corals, it will be convenient to consider the group as a merely provisional assemblage of forms, which cannot at present be finally systematized. The genus IIeliopora and its allies Heliolites, Plasmopora, kc., have been shown to be A lcyonaria, and will be considered under that head. Here, therefore, the order Tabulata will be taken as temporarily including the groups of the Milleporidae (Millepora, Axopora), the Thecidae ( Thecia), the Favositidae (Favosites and its allies), the Chaetetidae (Chaetetes and its allies), and the Halysitidae (Halysitcs, Syringopora, Ac. ) Accepting the order in this provisional aspect, it will be found that the Tabulata are mainly, indeed almost exclusively, confined to the Palaeozoic period. The Milleporidae, however, belong to the Tertiary and recent periods; Koninckia is Cretaceous; whilst Michelinia and some of the Chaetetidae have been stated to occur in the Oolitic series, though this determination is not free from doubt. The family of the Thecidae, including the single genus Thaecia, is exclusively Upper Silurian. Amongst the Favositidae, the type-genus Favosites is Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous, attaining its maximum of development in the Devonian; Emmonsia has nearly the same range as Favosites; Michelinia is found in the Devonian and Carboniferous, and is doubtfully quoted from the Oolites; Striatopora belongs to the Upper Silurian and Devonian; Alveolites is abundant in the Silurian and. Devonian, and disappears in the Carboniferous; Rxmcria is Devonian, and Koninckia is only known from the White Chalk. Of the Chaetetidae, Chaetetes, Monticulipora, and Stenopora are three imperfectly separated and closely allied groups, which are represented, collectively or separately, in all the Palaeozoic formations from the Lower Silurian to the Permian, inclusive; and forms very similar, if not identical, (Heteropora, Neuropora) occur in deposits of Mesozoic age. The genera Dania and Conaetcllaria are closely allied to the preceding, and are Silurian. Labechia may be temporarily placed here also, and is likewise Silurian. Fiaetulipora and Callopora are nearly related to the preceding and to one another (if not identical), and they range from the Silurian to the Carboniferous. Lastly, Beaumontia is Carboniferous. Amongst the Halysitidae, the type-genus Halysitcs is Silurian; Syringopora ranges from the Silurian to the Carboniferous, attaining its maximum in the Devonian; whilst the singular genus Flctchaeria, though typically Silurian, is said to bo represented by a species in the Trias (Muschelkalk). Lastly, the aberrant family of the Milleporidae does not seem to have come into existence till the Eocene Tertiary, where it is represented by the genus Millepora. The remarkable genus A xopora also dates its ⅛st appearance from the Eocene. There remain some other so-called Tabulate corals which have not been noticed in the above summary, but they are not of sufficient importance to require special mention.

The small group of the Tubulosa is confined exclusively to the Palaeo ∙ zoic period. The type-genus Aulopora is found in the Lower and Upper Silurian,the Devonian, and the Carboniferous, attaining its maximum in the Devonian. The genus Pyrgia is only known as occurring in the Carboniferous rocks.

Regarding the geological history of the Zoantharia sclerodermata in a summary form, it will be seen that the Palaeozoic period is characterized by the exclusive possession of the Tubulosa, the great development of the Tabulata, and the very small number of Aporosa and Perforata, the place of these latter groups being taken by the Tabulate and Rugose corals. The Mesozoic period is characterized by the great development of the Aporosa, and, towards its close, of the Perforata, though in a less degree; whilst the Tubulosa are wholly gone, and the Tabulata, along with the Rugose corals, have very nearly disappeared. Finally, the Kainozoic period is characterized by the greatly increased development of the Perforata, the Aporosa being proportionately diminished, though still remaining in great force, and the great recent group of the Millepores ( Tabulata I ) now for the first time making its appearance.

Order II.— Rugosa.

The members of this order agree with the Zoantharia sclerodermata in possessing a well-developed sclerodermic corallum, with a true theca, and generally presenting both tabulae and septa combined. The septa, however, are generally (though apparently not always) some multiple of four, and there is commonly a single predominant septum, or a vacant space (fossula) representing such a septum. Some of the Rugosa are simple, others are compound, but the latter are destitute of a true caenenchyma.
[9:6:381]

As there are only two living genera which agree with the Rugosa in the tetrameral arrangement of their septa, and as it is doubtful whether we are justified in positively asserting on this ground that these genera really are Rugosa, this great order of Actinozoa requires to be considered simply as regards the hard skeleton or corallum which alone has been preserved to us in a fossil condition. The corallum of the Rugosa is in most essential respects identical in structure with that of the Hexacoralla, differing principally in the numerical law of the septa and in the common conjunction of tabulae with the septa. It is very difficult to entertain any doubt but that the corallum of the Rugosa was secreted in a manner precisely similar to that of the existing Zoantharia sclerodermata, and that it bore essentially, if not precisely, similar relations to the soft parts of the animal which produced it. Thus, in both groups alike the corallum may be simple or compound; in both alike the simple form of corallum consists of an outer wall or “theca,” inclosing a central space or “visceral chamber,” which is divided into compartments by a series of radiating lamellae, or “septa;” in both alike the structures known as “dissepiments,” “tabulae,” and “columella” may be developed; in both alike the compound corallum may be regarded as essentially formed by an aggregation of “corallites,” similar in their fundamental structure to the simple corallum. With these striking and substantial points of agreement there are, nevertheless, not a few respects in which the Rugosa differ from the Zoantharia sclerodermata, and these will be best discussed by briefly considering the different parts of the Rugose corallum in succession.

The form of the corallum, when simple, is usually more or less conical, turbinate, cono-cylindrical, or cylindroidal, but it may be discoidal fPalaeoclycus, Microcyclus, <fcc.); or even everted (some species of Ptychophyllum), or sometimes prismatic (Goniophyllum), whilst it is often irregularly thickened by accretions of growth. The compound coralla necessarily vary much in form, being massive, fasciculate, <kc., according to the method in which new corallites are produced. The principal modes in which the corallum becomes compound amongstthe Rugosaoxeι the following :—

(1) Simple calicular gemmation.— In this process the original corallite, after growing for a certain length of time, sends up a single bud from its calicine disc, which usually is continued in the same axis as that of its parent. The primitive calice may or may not be more or less completely obliterated by the gradual growth and extension of the epitheca over it, and the secondary bud may or may not produce a tertiary bud in the same manner in which it was itself produced. Not uncommonly several buds may be produced successively, each from the oral disc of its predecessor, till the aged corallum comes to consist of a series of short turbinate cups or inverted cones, superimposed one upon the other, the younger upon the older. This singular mode of gemmation is seen in various species of Heliophyllum, Cystiphyllum, &c; and it cannot possibly be regarded as being merely accidental; whilst it may not improbably be regarded as an advanced form of the physiological process by which “accretions of growth” are produced. (2) Compound calicular gemmation.— In this process, the primitive corallite throws up from its calicine disc two or more buds, which, after reaching a certain size, in most cases repeat the process. The resulting form of corallum differs in different cases. In such forms as Cyathophyllum truncatum and C. paracida, the parent corallite is destroyed by its buds, and these are in turn destroyed by the buds which they put forth, all the corallites remaining more or less separate, and the entire corallum assuming the form of an inverted pyramidal mass, the base of which is formed by the primitive corallite. In other cases, as in Cyatlιophyllum regium, the corallites become intimately united by their walls, and the corallum becomes massive and astraeiform. In other cases, again, the corallum becomes fasciculate, the budding corallites not being killed by their buds, but continuing to grow upwards side by side with them, as is seen in some of the species of Cyathophyllum, Lonsdaleia, Endophyllum, &c. (3) Parietal Gemmation.— This process consists in the production of buds from the sides of the corallites at some point between the base and the margin of the calice. It does not differ in its nature or results from the same process as seen in the Zoantharia sclerodermata, and it generally gives rise to a loosely fasciculate corallum, as is well seen in various forms of Diphy phyllum, Lithostrotion, kc. (4) Basal Gemmation.— This process consists in the formation of buds by an extension of the substance of the original polype from the margin of its base; but it is doubtful if this mode of increase occurs at all amongst the true Rugose corals. (5) Fission.— Increase by spontaneous cleavage or fission is also of rare occurrence amongst the Rugosa, though it undoubtedly occurs occasionally, as in some species of Diphyphyllum.

However they may be produced, the corallites of the compound coralla of the Rugosa are never connected together by a true caenenchyma. When the corallites are in close contact, so that the corallum becomes massive, there is often fusion of the adjoining walls, but this is not necessarily the case. At other times the walls are wanting, and the corallites are united together by the extension and confluence of their septa (shhillipsastraea, Syringophyllum, Smithia, &c.), or by costae and vesicular dissepiments ( Pachy plιy llum). In other cases the corallites are united by exothecal outgrowths (as in Eridophylhιm).

The wall is usually well developed, and is not perforate. It is, however, often wanting altogether (as in Chonaxis, Phillipsastraea, Smithia, &c.), or very feebly represented. In many cases also there is a more or less strongly developed accessory wall, or internal mural investment (“muraille interne”), which is placed concentrically within the true wall, and thus divides the visceral chamber into a central and a circumferential space. This accessory wall may be present along with a well developed true wall (as in Acervularia and Cyclophyllum), or the accessory wall alone may be present, the true wall may be absent, and the corallites may be united with one another by the amalgamation of their septa and dissepiments (as in Pachyphyllum, Chonaxis, &c.)

The epitheca is usually well developed in the Rugosa, though sometimes very thin. It is closely applied as a rule to the true wall, and when thickened, the latter may be very feebly developed. In the compound coralla, there is often a general epitheca inclosing the corallites basally and laterally. We may, perhaps, also regard as being of an epithecal nature the extraordinary opercular structures which have been fully described by Lindstrom as occurring in certain Rugose corals, such as Goniophyllum, Calceola, and Rhizophyllum. In these forms the calice is closed completely by a calcareous plate or operculum which is single in Calceola, but composed of four pieces in Goniophyllum, and which must be supposed to have been capable of erection and retraction,—the corallum thus becoming like a bivalve shell. Indeed, the genus Calceola was long supposed to be referable to the Brachiopoda. It seems probable that some other Rugose corals, more normal in their charac ∙ ters than the above mentioned forms, were likewise provided with an operculum. Similar structures are observable in some Tabulate corals (as in certain species of Faυosites), where the calices become closed in progress of growth by a false operculum; and analogous structures have been recognized in certain living corals (Primuoa [9:6:382] and Paramuricea). Though not strictly epithecal, we may also consider in this connection the remarkable root-like processes (“radiciform prolongations”) which are so characteristic of many of the Rugosa (e.g. Omphyma, Goniophyllum, Rhizophyllum, Pholidophyllum, Ptychophyllum, &c.) These processes may attain a length of several inches, and they consist of a process of the epitheca and wall, inclosing a diverticulum of the visceral chamber, and in some cases subdivided by dissepiments. In the simple species (such as Omphynuι) they serve to attach the corallum to foreign objects; but similar processes occur in various compound forms (Eridophyllum, &c.), and serve to unite the various corallites with one another, being thus of the same nature and function as the tubular connecting processes of the Tabulate genus Syringopora.

The epitheca of the Rugose corals is usually marked with numerous fine encircling striae, and with longitudinal lines, grooves, or ridges. The latter, however, are usually regarded as not being true costae. They differ, in fact, from tne costae of the Zoantharia sclerodermata in not being placed opposite the septa, but alternating with these structures, and thus corresponding with the interseptal loculi. Not uncommonly (as in many species of Zaphrentis, in Streptelasma, &c.) there are two of these pseudo-costae, which are pre-eminently developed and run along the dorsal surface of the corallum, the other ridges converging towards this central pair in a pinnate manner. This appearance seems to be due to the fact that the growth of the cor-rallum was effected by the intercalation of successive septa along the sides of the primary septum to which this principal pair of pseudo-costae corresponds. In Pholidophyllum the costae are double, and are l covered by double longitudinal rows of small imbricated scales of an epithecal nature. In genera in which the wall is absent and the corallites are united together by the confluence of the septa (e.g. in Pachyphyllum, Smithia, Phillipsastraed), it is impossible to determine whether true costae are present or not. True costae are also certainly present in the genus Holocystis.

The calice in the Rugosa varies greatly in form, shape, depth, &c. It is usually more or less circular, or oval, sometimes semicircular or subtriangular in outline (Rhizophyllum.), sometimes quadrilateral (Goniophyllum). It may be very shallow, or very deep, and its edges may be completely everted (e.g. in Ptychophyllum patellatum). It may be at right angles to the axis of the corallum, or it may have any degree of obliquity. In the simple and curved or horn-shaped coralla, it is very common for the calice to be very oblique to the axis of the coral; and in these cases the convex side of the corallum (dorsal side) is the longest, and the concave side (ventral side) is the shortest.

The septa of the Rugosa are substantially similar to those of the Zoantharia sclerodermata in form and structure, forming, when well developed, a series of vertical calcareous laminae which are primitively double, spring from the inner surface of the wall, and radiate towards the centre of the visceral chamber. They are rarely or never perforate, and they vary much in the extent of their development. Sometimes they are almost wholly aborted, being only recognizable as so many faint striae on the inner surface of the calice (as in the typical examples of Cystiphyllum). At other times, they extend inwards only an extremely short distance from the wall, as in the genus Amplexus. In other cases, again, they are well developed towards the centre of the corallum, but have no connection with the outer wall, from which they are separated by dissepimental vesicles, as in the genus Lonsdaleia. In other instances, finally, they have their normal arrangement, being attached externally to the wall, and extending inwards ⅞o, or near to, the centre of the visceral chamber. In rare cases the septa may be all of nearly the same size; more commonly they are markedly different in size. Most of the forms in which the septa are well developed, show a distinct tetrameral arrangement of the septa, though it does not appear possible to assert positively that the primitive and first developed cycle of septa consists of only four elements. In many cases, however, the septa of the adult are a multiple of four, and their quadripartite disposition may be plainly manifested by the fact that four of the septa are preeminently developed and form a conspicuous cross (Stauria), or by the presence of four calicine depressions which have a similar cruciform arrangement (Omphyma). In the typical Rugosa the septa, though undoubtedly not simultaneously developed, are nevertheless of only two sizes, a larger and a smaller, alternating regularly with one another; and they cannot, therefore, be distinguished according to their dimensions into a series of regular cycles. The small or secondary septa also may be occasionally’ absent. The primary or larger septa, be their development what it may, are for the most part equal in size; but, notwithstanding this fact, the corallum often shows a very distinct bilateral symmetry, . , ll θ a - PP aren tly to the primitive tetrameral disposition of the septa. '1 his is especially shown in the general existence either of a single septum of larger size than all the others (one of the four primitive septa), or of an extraordinary vacant spa,. ⅛ representing this septum, and known as the “septal fossula.” The septal fossula usually presents itself as a more or less conspicuous depression or groove in the calice, and its position, though apparently constant in any given form, is variable, being sometimes on the convex side of the corallum in the simple forms, sometimes on the concave side, and rarely situated laterally. In general it is a simple space or deficiency caused by the absence or abortion of one of the four primary septa, and it is seen in transverse sections to be occupied by from one to three short septa. Sometimes it is accompanied by a tubular depression of the tabulae at that point. Sometimes there are two smaller lateral fossulae, directed at right angles to the main depression, and representing two others of the primitive septa. At other times there may be four shallow fossulae arranged in a crucial manner (Omphyma), but it is not certain that these correspond with the four primitive septa. Lastly, in the genus Metriophyllum the septa are arranged in four groups, which are separated from one another by vacant spaces or fossulae, though in this case also it is not certain that these spaces are homologous with the true septal fossulae of forms like Zaphrentis. The precise physiological import of the fossula is uncertain; but its presence gives rise to an irregularity in the arrangement of the septa which is highly characteristic of the Rugosa. Whilst in Stauria all four of the primitive septa are pre-eminently developed, only three are thus predominant in Anisopyllum, and only one in Hallia. The free edges of the septa, where they appear in the calice, are in general plain and smooth, but they may bear granular tubercles (Palaeocyclus), or teeth (Zaphrentis cornicula, Heliophyllum). The sides of the septa are likewise generally smooth, but they may be granulated (Palaeocyclus), or they may be adorned with arched and ascending striae (Heliophyllum).

The axis of the corallum is very often occupied by a columella, which varies much in structure in different cases. In forms such as Cyathaxonia, Lithostrotion, Koninckophyllum, &c., we have a proper or essential columella, which is developed independently of the septa, occupies the centre of the visceral chamber, and projects as a solid rod into the floor of the calice. In other cases the columella is composed of twisted lamellae, which inosculate with one another so as to give rise to a vesicular axis, as in Lonsdaleia and Axophyllum. In other cases, a false columella may be produced by the twisting together of the inner edges of some of the primary septa (as in some species of Gyathophyllum). In other cases, finally, the axis of the visceral chamber may be occupied by a series of more or less complicated structures, which may occupy a considerable space, and which have sometimes been regarded as representing a kind of columella (Clisiophyllum, Dibunophytlum, Rhodo- phyllum, Cyclophyllum, &c). These axial structures, however, can only in a very limited sense be regarded as columellar.

The continuity of the interseptal loculi in the Rugosa is generally more or less interfered with by the development of endothecal dissepiments; but in no case are synapticulae present. The dissepiments vary greatly in character and amount. Sometimes they are wholly wanting (Cyathaxonidae and some species of Amplexus); at other times they may be present in small amount (Lophophyllum, somes species of Amplexus, &c.); at other times they are exceedingly abundant. In the species of Cyathophyllum, in Lithostrotion, in Koninckophyllum, and in other forms, the dissepiments are so largely developed towards the circumference of the visceral chamber as to give rise to a dense peripheral zone of vesicular tissue. In longitudinal sections of the corallum this vesicular tissue is seen to be composed of very minute lenticular cells arranged in oblique rows directed upwards and outwards. In other forms, such as Campophyllum, Lonsdaleia, &c., a similar zone of vesicular tissue exists, but the cells which enter into its composition are of very large size. In the genus Heliophyllum, and in certain other forms, there are found singular dissepimental structures, which are attached to the sides of the septa, but do not extend completely across the interseptal loculi. The structures in question constitute a series of plates which are attached by their bases to the sides of the septa, projecting freely into the interseptal loculi, and directed inwards and upwards in an arched manner from the interior of the wall towards the centre of the visceral chamber. These arched ridges are placed at corresponding points on the opposite side of each septum; they consequently appear on the free edges of the septa within the calice as so many spines, and they communicate to cross-sections of the septa a characteristic cross-barred appearance. In the Cystiphyllidae, again, the entire visceral chamber is filled with a vesicular tissue of convex and inclined cells, which may be regarded as formed partly by dissepiments and partly by tabulae.

Tabulae are in general well developed amongst the Rugose corals, and coexist with well developed septa. In some genera (such as Amplexus and Zaphrentis) the tabulae are “complete,” that is to say, they pass completely across the visceral chamber from side to side, thus dividing it into a succession of distinct stories, of which only the uppermost is occupied by the living tissues of the animal. In a greater number of cases ( e.g. Cyathophyllum, Lithostrotion, Lonsdaleia, Heliophyllum, &c,), the tabulae are “incomplete,” that is to say they do not extend across the visceral chamber, but are confined to a larger or smaller central area. The central tabulate area may or may not be pierced by a columella; and the septa [9:6:383] may either be prolonged across the upper surfaces of the tabulae to the centre of the corallum, or they may fall short of the centre, and thus leave a larger or smaller area of the tabulae free to view, and conspicuously visible in the floor of the calice. The tabulae may be well developed, approximately horizontal, remote plates, as is usually the case in Zaphrentis and Amplexus, or they may anasto-moze in various ways, and become so intimately connected with one another as to give rise to a species of vesicular tissue.

As regards the affinities of the Rugose corals, doubts have of late years been expressed as to their systematic position and relationships. By Professor Louis Agassiz the entire order of the Rugosa was transferred from the Actinozoa to the Hydrozoa, but upon insufficient evidence. It had been observed by Agassiz that the living animal of Millepora was apparently a hydroid, closely allied to Hydractinia, and it was upon the strength of this observation alone that the distinguished American naturalist proposed this sweeping change. The following considerations show, however, that this change cannot be accepted. (1) Millepora is not a Rugose coral, but belongs to the so-called Tabulate corals, of which it constitutes a very aberrant member. Even, therefore, were it satisfactorily proved that the genus Millepora is a true Hydrozoön, is to which naturalists are not yet agreed, this would not affect the classification of the Rugosa, which are very distinct in their structure from the Tabulata, and have no affinities with them further than is implied by the fact that tabulae are present in both. (2) It has been shown that the group of the Tabulata itself contains both true Zoantharia and true Alcyonaria, so that the hydroid character of Mïllepora, if admitted, would not so much as cause the removal of the Tabulata to the Hydrozoa. (3) It has further been shown that tabulae are present in certain forms which are unquestionably Actinozoa, as shown by an examination of the living animal {Pocillopora and Lophohelia). It is evident, therefore, that the presence of tabulae in itself should have no weight in determining the systematic position of any given form, unless at the same time the structure of the living animal be known. (4) Apart from the close similarity between the corallum of the Rugosa and that of the recent Zoantharia sclerodermata, the Rugose corals are provided, almost invariably, with structures which, so far as we know, are absolutely irreconcilable with the belief in their Hydrozoal affinities. They possess, namely, in almost all cases, well developed septa, which, if they do not absolutely imply the existence of mesenteries in the living animal, are, at any rate, wholly unknown as occurring amongst the recent Hydrozoa. We may, therefore safely accept the conclusion of Verrill, Pourtales, Claus, Duncan, Milne Edwards, and other distinguished authorities, that Agassiz has failed to bring forward sufficient evidence in favour of his view that the Rugosa are referable to the Hydrozoa.

More lately Dr Lindstrom has endeavoured to show that the Rugosa cannot be placed amongst the Actinozoa, but “must form a class of their own in the great division of the Radiated Animals.” The chief grounds upon which this conclusion is reached are “the compact imperforate structure of the calyx and septa (the septa originating from four primary ones), the absence of costae, the strange septal fossae in the bottom of the calyx, the processes resembling rootlets, the transverse floors or tabulae in the interior, which often have a cellular or vesicular structure,” and the occasional presence of an operculum. It is obvious, however, that none of the above-mentioned peculiarities are of such fundamental importance as to justify us in overlooking the substantial identity of structure which subsists between the corallum of the Rugosa and that of the Aporose section of the Zoantharia sclerodermata. The wall and septa are often compact amongst the latter; the septa have a tetrameral arrangement in the unquestionable living Actinozoa, Haploplιyllia and Guynia ,∙ the septal fossula is not always recognizable amongst the Rugosa; the presence of rootlets and the nature of the costae are points of secondary importance; tabulae are present in undoubted corals belonging to the Zoantharia sclerodermata ; and the occasional presence in some abnormal forms of an operculum would no more justify us in removing the Rugosa from the Actinozoa that we should be warranted for the same reason in removing the living Primnoae from the Alcyonaria. Upon the whole, then, there appears to be little danger in accepting the conclusion reached by Professor Verrill, one of the most distinguished of living authorities on the subject, that there can no longer be any reasonable doubt but that the coralla of the great majority of the Rugosa were made by “true polypes essentially similar to those of the existing corals.” Indeed, if any great change in our classification is to be made, it would seem rather to be in the direction of more closely approximating the Rugυsa to the Zoantharia sclerodermata. The tetrameral arrangement of the septa is by no means always very conspicuous amongst the Rugosa, and it seems not unlikely that too high a classificatory value has been attached to it. Leaving this out of account, the affinities of the typical Rugosa with the Aporosa are very close, and it may be doubted if it would not be proper to establish a more intimate union between these groups. At the same time, it must not be overlooked, as pointed out by Mosely, that the Rugosa have certain affinities with the Alcyonaria, and especially with singular recent Heliopora. Great stress, however, can hardly be laid upon the existence of paired opercular structures in Goniophyllum and in the existing Alcyonarian genus Primnoa, since Goniophyllum, if a Rugose coral at all, must be referred to the Gystiphyllidae, a family in which all the more characteristic features of the Rugose organization have disappeared.

The divisions of the Rugosa recognized and founded by Milne-Edwards and Jules H aime, and subsequently generally adopted, are the following :—

Fam. I. Stauridae. —The wall is well developed; the septa lamellar, extending without interruption from the bottom to the top of the visceral chamber, and showing a conspicuous quaternary arrangement. The interseptal loculi are crossed by endothecal dissepiments, and there is a central tabulate area. Of the five genera which form the family, Stauria has a compound corallum, astraeiform in shape, and increasing by calicular gemmation; there is no columella; and the four primitive septa form a conspicuous cross. Holocystis is also composite and astraeiform,—the corallites being united by well developed costae, and a styliform columella being present. Of the simple genera, the Permian Polycaelia and the Tertiary Conosmilia are closely allied to one another; but rhe third, Metriophyllum, is so aberrant that it may require to be placed in a separate family, as its septa are arranged in four distinct groups, separated from one another by four distinct fossulae.

Fam. II. Cyathaxonidae. —In this family the corallum is simple, with a deep calice; the septa are well developed, and extend from the bottom of the visceral chamber to the floor of the calice; the interseptal loculi are completely open, and there are neither dissepiments nor tabulae. Though exhibiting a quaternary arrangement, the four primaiy septa are not conspicuously developed above the others. This family makes an exceedingly close approach to the Aporose group of the Turbinolidae, from which it is separated by the tetrameral arrangement of the septa. Of the genera of the family, Cyathaxonia is Palaeozoic, whilst Haplophyllia and Guynia are recent. No Secondary or Tertiary forms are as yet known.

Fam. III. Cyathophyllidae. —In this family the corallum is simple or compound; and the septa are always more or less interrupted, and do not extend as complete lamellae from the bottom to the top of the visceral chamber, being more or less imperfect either internally or externally. The four primitive septa are not pre-eminently developed, so as to give rise to a conspicuous cross. The interseptal loculi are generally more or less interrupted by the development of dissepiments, and tabulae are invariably present. The family of the Cyathophyllidae is divided by Milne-Edwards and Haime into the two tribes of the Zaphrentinae and the Cyathophyllinae. a. Zaphrentinae.— In this tribe the corallum is simple and free; a well-developed septal fossula is present, which may be formed by a tubular inflection of the tabulae on one side, or may be replaced by a cristiform process. The septa usually fall short of the centre of the visceral chamber, and, from the presence of a septal fossula, are invariably more or less irregular in their arrangement. The tabulae are complete, and pass from one side of the visceral chamber to the other; while dissepiments are poorly developed, and there is usually nothing of the nature of a columella. The Zaphrentinae are exclusively Palaeozoic, and the principal genera of the family are Zaphrentis, Amplexus, Mcnophyllum, Lopho∙ phyllum, Anisophyllum, Baryphylhcm, Hadrophyllum, Microcyclus, Combophyllum, Trochophyllum, Aulacophyllum, Hallux, and Streptelasma. b. Cyathophyllinae.— In this family the septa do not exhibit the irregularity which is so conspicuous in the Zaphrentinae, but are more or less regularly radiate in their arrangement. In some [9:6:384] cases, the septa may be equally divided into four groups by four shallow fossae in the calice. A tine columella may be present or absent, or there may be a pseudo-columella formed by the twisting together of the inner edges of the septa. A more or less well-developed zone of vesicular tissue, formed by endothecal dissepiments, is usually found on the exterior of the visceral chamber; and the tabulae are not complete, but occupy a more or less extensively developed central area. The corallum may be simple or compound. All the Cyathophyllidae are Palaeozoic, and the principal genera are Cyathophyllum, Campophyllum, Omphyma, Pachy- phyllum, Chonophyllum, Ptychophyllum, Heliophyllum, Palaeocyclus, Clisiophyllum, Dibunophyllum, Aspidophyllum, Rhodo- phylhιm, Aulophyllum, Cyclophyllum, Acervularia, Strombodes, Phillipsastraea, Smithia, Endophyllum, Spongophyllum, Syringo∙ phyllum, Eτidophyllum, Diphyphyllum, Lithostrotion, Lonsdaleia, Chonaxis, Axophyllum, Koninckophyllum, &c.

Fam. IV. Cystiphyllidae. —The corallum in this family is simple, or rarely compound; the septa are rudimentary, and are generally only recognizable as so many vertical striae within the calice. The outer wall is complete, but the entire visceral chamber is filled with small convex vesicles, sometimes arranged in infundibuliform layers, and formed by the dissepiments and tabulae in combination. A distinct septal fossula may or may not be present. The entire family is Palaeozoic, and the only undoubted genus is Cystiphyllum itself. In their internal structure, however, the singular operculate corals of the genera Goniophyllum, Rhixophyllum, and Calceola present striking affinities with the Cystiphyllidae, whilst a species of the genus Cystiphylhιm (C. prismaticum) has been described by Lindstrom as being furnished with an operculum. We may, therefore, with great probability, refer the above mentioned abnormal genera to this family of the Rugosa. It should be borne in mind that the Cystiphyllidae, with or without Goniophyllum and its allies, are such abnormal forms that it is difficult to assert positively that they belong to the Rugosa, and it remains possible that they should be separated to form a special group.

As regards their geological distribution, the Rugose corals have a vast development in the seas of the Palaeozoic period, where they seem to take the place, to a large extent at any rate, of the Aporose section of the Zoantharia, sclerodermata. In the Secondary period only one genus (Jlolocystìs) of the Rugosa is known, and but one is known in the Tertiary rocks (Conosmilia), whilst the only two living genera which could be referred here are the Haplophyllia of Florida and the Guynia of the Mediterranean.

In the Silurian period the Rugosa are very largely developed, especially in the upper division. The principal genera of this period are— Cyathophyllum, Zaphrentis, Cystiphyllum, Streptelasma, Acervularia, Strombodes, Omphyma, Palaeocyclus, Diphyphyllum, Amplexus, Ptychophyllum, Stauria, Syringophyllum, Goniophyllum, Rhizophyllum, and Pholidophyllum. [The Lower Silurian Colum- nariae with complete septa (Favistella) are probably Aporose corals; Columnopora is perhaps one of the Perforata; and Petraia and Duncanella are in a somewhat dubious position.] In deposits of Devonian age, Rugose corals are exceedingly abundant, the principal genera of this period being Cyathophyllum, Heliophyllum, Diphyphyllum, Eridophyllum, Campophyllum, Endophyllum, Pachyphyllum, Phillipsastraea, Acervularia, Smithia, Spongophyllum, Blothrophyllum, Zaphrentis, Baryphyllum, Aulacoρhyllum, Anisophyllum, Trochophyllum, Combophyllum, Hadrophyllum, Microcyclus, Hallia, Metriophyllum, and Amplexus. In the Carboniferous period the Rugose corals still remain very abundantly represented by forms belonging to such genera as Cuathophyllum, Lithostrotion, Diphyphyllum, Lonsdaleia, Axophyllum, Clisiophyllum, Cyclophyllum, Rhodophyllum, Zaphrentis, Amplexus, Loplιophyllum, Meno-phyllum, Campophyllum, Phillipsastraea, &c. In the Permian rocks, which so far have proved to be extremely uncoralliferous, no examples of the Rugosa are known save the genus Polycaelia, so far at any rate as Britain is concerned. In the great series of the Secondary formations no Rugosa are as yet known save two species of the single genus Holocystis of the Lower Cretaceous. In the treat series of the Tertiary deposits, again, there has hitherto been iscovered only a single Rugose genus, the Conosmilia of the later Tertiaries of Australia.

Order III.— Alcyonaria (f)ctocorallf).

The members of this order are Actinozoa in which the polypes possess eight tentacles, which are fringed on their sides with lateral pinnae, or papillae. As in the Zoantharia, the mouth opens into a tubular stomach, which in turn communicates freely with the body-cavity, and the stomach is connected with the body-wall by means of a series of vertical membranous laminae or mesenteries. The mesenteries, however, are only eight in number, and are not paired, one of the tentacles corresponding with and opening into each inter-mesenteric chamber. As a general rule a corallum is secreted, though this may be wanting, and its nature differs in different cases. In some forms (Alcyonium, Xenia, &c.) the corallum is sclerodermic, and consists of variously-formed spicules of lime scattered in the soft tissues. In others (Tubipora) the corallum is external and sclerodermic, with true thecae, but without septa or tabulae, and formed of fused spicules, detached structures of the same nature existing in the soft parts. In others (Heliopora) the corallum is external and sclerodermic, with true thecae provided with septa and tabulae. In others, finally (Gorgonia, Corallium, Pennatula, &c.), there is double corallum, the one consisting of a calcareous or horny sclerobasis, over which the soft parts are spread, the other consisting of sclerodermic spicules scattered in the integuments. With the exception of the single genus Haimeia, which is possibly not a mature form, all the A lcyonaria are composite. The tubular polypes are united by a caenosarc, and their body-cavities are placed in communication by means of canals which ramify through the coenosarc, and permit of a free circulation of nutrient fluids. The form of the colony varies greatly in different cases, being usually more or less branched, arborescent, or lobate, but being at other times massive, incrusting, creeping, linear, &c. None of them possess the power of independent locomotion, most being rooted to foreign objects in their adult condition, but some being simply sunk in the mud, and a few floating freely in the sea. Many of them exhibit the most brilliant coloration, due in many instances to the brightly-coloured spicules disseminated in their tissues. In some, lastly, it has been shown that the colony normally consists of two kinds of polypes, one sexual, the other sexless and permanently rudimentary. The Alcyonaria may be briefly discussed under the five following families :—

Fam. I. Alcyonidae. —The members of this family are all fixed to foreign objects, and are more or less fleshy in their consistence, owing to the fact that the corallum consists simply of sclerodermic spicules scattered in the integuments, and there is no sclerobasis. The spicules are of various forms, but principally fusiform, and they are scattered through the coenosarc and the soft tissues generally, but are often specially aggregated at the bases of the tentacles and along the tentacles themselves. The spicules may be present in very small numbers (as in some species of Spoggodes), but they may be present in such numbers as to render the surface rough and prickly (as in Nepthya, Paralcyonium, and the typical species of Spoggodes). The actinosoma may form lobate masses within which the polypes can be retracted at will ( A lcyonium), or more or less branched and having the polypes non-retractile ( Xenia ). Others form membranous crusts, attached to foreign bodies, the polypes being sometimes retractile (Anthelia), sometimes non-retractile (Sympodium). Others form a creeping colony of slender stolons, sending up polypes at different points, the lower portion of the colony being so thickened by spicular secretions as to constitute a kind of tubular corallum into which the polypes can withdraw (Cornularia). In the genus Sarcophyton, lastly, it has recently been shown (Mosely) - that the colony, like that of many of the Pennatulidae, is dimorphic, consisting partly of sexually perfect polypes, and partly of zooids which are destitute of generative organs and of tentacles. The zooids, however, have a stomach and mouth, and are connected with the perfect polypes by a canalsystem.

Fam. II. Tubiporidae. —This forms a very small family, including only the various species of the “Organ-pipe corals ” ( Tubipora), and often included with the preceding, to which it is closely related. In the common Tubipora musica, which may be taken as the type of the family, there is a very well developed sclerodermic corallum, with true thecae enclosing the polypes, but without septa. The corallum is bright red in colour, and is composed of tubular, cylindrical thecae, usually growing regularly side by side, but at a little distance from one another, and united at intervals by horizontal epithecal expansions, which represent external tabulae. There are no septa, nor internal tabulae; and Dr Perceval Wright has shown that the tubes are really composed of fused spicules. The polypes are green, with eight pinnate tentacles studded with lenticular spicules. The polypes when alarmed retract themselves within, their tubes, the upper portion of the tube, as [9:6:385] shown by Dr Wright, being composed of fusiform warty spicules which are loose, and thus allow this part to be pulled into the lower dense portion of the theca. The mouth is placed between the bases of the tentacles, with a slightly elevated lip, and leads into a small stomach-sac. There are eight mesenteries, within which the reproductive organs are contained. The exothecal expansions, by which the tubes are united, appear to be produced periodically as horizontal extensions from the mouths of the tubes.

Fam. III. Pennatulidae. —The “Sea-pens” and “Sea-rods’' are compound Alcyonaria, but instead of being rooted to some foreign object, they possess a fleshy, usually columnar or rod-like base, which is non-polypiferous, and is plunged in the sand and mud of the sea-bottom. The upper portion of the colony carries the polypes, and varies much in shape. Sometimes the polypes are borne on long lateral pinnae, which give the upper portion of the actinosoma a feather-like appearance ( Pennatula) ; whilst at other times there are similar but much shorter pinnae (V^irgularia). In Veretillum the upper portion ol the colony is short and clubshaped, and carries the polypes all around its circumference, and the same is the case in Cophobel-emnon. In Pavonaria the polypes are non-retractile, and are disposed on one side of the slender actinosoma; whilst in Renilla the polypes are also unilateral, but the polypiferous surface is thin and reniform. In Umbellularia, the polypes are carried in a cluster at the top of the actinosoma. The corallum in the Pennatulidae is usually two-fold, consisting on the one hand of a slender, styliform, horny, or calcareous axis (sclerobasis) concealed within the coenosarc, which it serves to support, and, on the other hand, of small calcareous spicules scattered amongst the soft tissues. In some cases the sclerobasis is rudimentary. The Pennatulidae often possess the power of phosphorescence in a high degree, and they possess the same system of caeno-sarcal canals as is characteristic of the Alcyonaria generally. The polypes have eight pinnately-fringed tentacles, and eight mesenteric folds. In many cases, as originally shown by Kölliker, the colony consists of two classes of zooids, the one composed of sexually mature polypes, the other, more numerous, composed of sexless polypes, in which the tentacles are not developed.

Fam. IV. Gorgonidae. —The “Sea-shrubs” possess a more or less branched caenosarc, which is permanently rooted to some foreign object, and is provided with a grooved or sulcate branched βclerobasis, with which are associated true tissue-secretions in the form of variously shaped sclerodermic spicules (“sclerites”). As regards their soft parts, the Gorgonidae do not differ from the other Alcyonaria, the polypes possessing eight fringed tentacles, with eight mesenteries, united by a canal-system, which ramifies through a fleshy caenosarc. The caenosarc, however, is always closely applied to, and supported by, a more or less branched sclerobasis, over which it forms a thin fleshy expansion (“cortex ”), and the polypes are capable of complete retraction within the caenosarc. The soft tissues are also abundantly supplied with true sclerodermic secretions, In the form of calcareous spicules of very various shapes, and often of very brilliant colours, which are in many instances so characteristic in their form that they can be employed as a ground of generic distinction. The spicules (“sclerites’ 5 ) are usually buried in the soft tissues, but they may project beyond the surface of the caenosarc in such numbers as to render the integument rough and scoriaceous (Muricea). The sclerobasis varies greatly both in texture and form. Sometimes it resembles that of the Antipathidae in being corneous and unjointed, but its surface is always striate or grooved, whereas in the “Black Corals” it is smooth or echinulate. Its form is usually more or less branched, dendroid, or minutely arborescent (as in Primnoa, Muricea, Gorgonia, Leptogorgia, &c.), or it may be in the shape of a regularly reticulate flabelliform expansion (Rhipidogorgia). In the genus Isis the sclerobasis is branched and articulated, composed of alternating calcareous and horny joints, and having the new branches produced from the calcareous nodes. In Melithaea and Mopsea, again, the corallum is likewise branched and articulated; but the joints are alternately hard and soft; the hard joints being composed of fused calcareous spicules, and the flexible joints of horny matter intermixed with calcareous spicules and connective tissue, whilst the new branches are developed from the corneous segments. Lastly, in Red Coral (Corallium) the sclerobasis is unjointed, more or less branched, and densely calcareous. It is of a red or pink colour, and finely grooved upon Its surface; and it is really composed of fused spicules, and thus differs very materially from the true sclerodermic corallum. The calcareous axis is covered with a bright red caenosar-cal crust or cortex, which is studded by the apertures for the polypes. The polypes are milk-white in colour, with eight pinnately-fringed tentacles, and completely retractile within the fleshy bark. The polypes are further placed in direct communication by means of anastomozing canals channelled out of the caenosarc and filled with a nutrient fluid. It has been shown by Lacaze-Duthiers that the colonies of Corallium are sometimes composed of male polypes, sometimes of female, or occasionally all the polypes of some branches of a colony may be of one sex, and all the polypes of other branches of the opposite sex, whilst in some instances polypes occur which are hermaphrodite and combine in themselves the organs of both sexes.

Fam. V. Helioporidae. —An examination of the living Heliopora in its fresh state has recently induced Mr Mosely to found this family for the reception of the existing genus Heliopora and a number of extinct forms previously placed amongst the Tabulata. In Heliopora there exists a well-developed sclerodermic corallum, of a composite nature, and composed of corallites united by caenenchyma. The corallites are tubular, crossed regularly by well-developed tabulae, and having their walls folded in such a manner as to give rise to a variable number (generally twelve) of septal laminae. The caenenchyma is composed of slender tubes, of smaller size than the true corallites, and packed closely side by side. The caenenchymal tubuli are destitute of septa, but, like the corallites, are crossed by regular transverse tabulae. The sclerenchyma is not composed of fused spicules, as in Corallium and Tubipora, but of fibro-crystalline calcareous tissue, as in the Zoantharia sclerodermata. The soft parts occupy only the parts of the corallum above the uppermost tabulae, and therefore only a surface-layer of the colony is actually alive. The polypes are. completely retractile, with pinnately-fringed tentacles, which are introverted in retraction. There are also eight lobed mesenteries, but these in no way correspond with the [9:6:386] septa the latter being twelve in number. The septa are thus seen bo be pseudo-septa, and they cannot be regarded as homologous with the septa of the Zoantharia sclerodermata. The caenenchymal tubes are occupied by sacs lined by the endoderm, which are closed externally but communicate freely with the somatic cavities of the polypes by means of transverse canals. Mr Mosely su""ests, with great probability, that the sacs lining the caenenchymal tubes are really of the nature of aborted polypes. (A similar suggestion was put forth by the present writer with regard to the caenenchymal tubuli of Heliolites and its allies, upon other grounds. Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin., vol. xxvii. p. 248.)

The investigations and discoveries of Mr Mosely with regard to Heliopora are of special interest, as settling the true position of a number of fossil corals, which had previously been placed in the Tabulate division of the Zoantharia sclerodermata, but which must now be referred to the Alcyonaria. The discovery, also, of tabulae combined with a genuine sclerodermic corallum in an undoubted Alcyonarian further raises a question as to the true affinities not only of the Tabulata generally, but also of the Rugosa; whilst the discovery of septa which do not correspond with the mesenteries of the living animal will produce important results in the study of the fossil corals generally. Without entering into any of these questions here, there can be no doubt but that the extinct genus Heliolites and its allies are so closely related to Heliopora as to necessitate their being placed in the Aloyonaria as members of the family Helioporidae. In the genus Heliolites there is a well-developed sclerodermic corallum, the corallites being tubular, regularly tabulate, and usually with well-developed septa, whilst the caenenchyma is composed of tabulate, geometric tubuli, smaller than the corallites and without septa. In the genus Plasmopora the corallum is very similar to that of Heliolites, differing chiefly in the fact that the caenenchyma is more vesicular, and the tubuli are not so distinct. Propora, again, can hardly be separated from Plasmopora, its chief distinction being that the calices are exsert. Lyeilia, also, is closely related to Heliolites. Polytremacis, also, differs from Heliolites chiefly in its granular surface, and it is hardly separable from Heliopora except by the fact that its septa are more developed. Finally, there are various extinct genera, such as Fistulipora, Callopora, &c., which have very close relationships to Heliolites, though they are destitute of septa, and which very probably will have to be ultimately associated in the same group.

With regard to the distribution in space of the Alcyonaria, it is sufficient to say that they are very widely spread over the globe, occurring in all seas from the warmest to the coldest, and at almost all depths. The Alcyonidae are for the most part inhabitants of shallow water, but the Pennatulidae are represented up to almost the greatest depths yet sounded by the dredge. The Gorgonidae are principally shallow-water forms, and attain their maximum of development in the seas of the tropics, abounding on coral reefs, to the beauty of which they greatly contribute. The red coral of commerce {Corallium rubrum) is a Mediterranean species, and occurs principally at depths of from 5 to 6 fathoms, though extending its range up to 120 fathoms or more. It is very largely sought after, and obtains a high price for ornamental purposes. The “coral fishery” is carried on by means of machines of different construction, which are dragged over the sea-bottom, and which usually injure more of the coral than they actually bring to the surface. Hence many valuable coral-beds have been completely exhausted, and the industry has no longer the importance that it formerly possessed. The “Organ-pipe corals” (Tubipora) are confined to the warm seas of the “coral-reef region;” and the genus Heliopora, the only living representative of the family Helioporidae, is confined to the Pacific and Indian Oceans.

As regards their distribution in time, none of the Alcyonaria, except the Helioporidae, can be said to be known with certainty in deposits of Palaeozoic age. The genus Protovirgularia was founded by M i Coy for the reception of a Silurian fossil which he believed to be allied to the living Virgulariae, but it appears to be certainly not of this nature, and is probably a graptolite. The family of the Ilelioporidae is well represented in the Palaeozoic period; the genus Heliolites being Silurian and Devonian, Propora and Lyeilia being Silurian, and Plasmopora Silurian and doubtfully Devonian. If Callopora and Fistulipora be referred to this group, then we may also consider that we have Carboniferous and Permian representatives of it. The genus Polytremacis, again, is confined to the Cretaceous period. The family of the Gorgonidae is not known to be represented with certainty earlier than the Eocene Tertiary, tw o genera sMopsea and Websteria) being found in the London clay. The genus Corallium has been doubtfully quoted from the Upper Oolites and Upper Cretaceous, and undoubtedly occurs as early as the Miocene. The Miocene deposits have also yielded species of Isis, Gorgonia, Gorgonella, and Melithaea. The family of the Pennatulidae is not represented earlier than the latest Secondary or the earlier Tertiary deposits. The genus Pavonaria is said to occur in the Pisolitic Limestone of France, whilst Graplιu- laria (and perhaps Virgularia) is found in the Eocene. The Miocene Tertiary has also yielded species of Virgularia, Graphularia, and Caelographula. The family of the Tubiporidae has not been recognized at all in a fossil condition. Lastly, the past existence of the Alcyonidae has only been recognized with any certainty in the Pliocene deposits, the Red and White Crags having yielded a species of Alcyonium.

Industrial Uses of Corals.— Beyond their general utility and value as sources of lime, none of the corals presents any special feature of industrial importance, excepting the red or precious coral (shorallvum rubrum) of the Mediterranean Sea. It, however, is and has been from remote times very highly prized for jewellery, personal ornamentation, and decorative purposes generally. About the beginning of the Christian era a great trade was carried on in coral between the Mediterranean and India, where it was highly esteemed as a substance endowed with mysterious sacred properties. It is remarked by Pliny that, previous to the existence of the Indian demand, the Gauls were in the habit of using it for the ornamentation of their weapons of war and helmets; but in his day, so great was the Eastern demand, that it was very rarely seen even in the regions which produced it. Among the Romans branches of coral were hung around children’s necks to preserve them from danger, and the substance had many medicinal virtues attιibuted to it. A belief in its potency as a charm continued to be entertained throughout mediaeval times; and even to the present day in Italy it is worn as a preservative from the evil eye, and by females as a cure for sterility.

The precious coral is found widespread on the borders and around the islands of the Mediterranean Sea. The beds are generally from 2 to 10 miles from the land, and in water of about 30 up to 130 fathoms deep; but it finds its most favourable conditions in 80 fathoms water. The most important fisheries extend along the coasts of Tunis, Algeria, and Morocco; but red coral is also obtained in the vicinity of Naples, near Leghorn and Genoa, and on the coasts of Sardinia, Corsica, Catalonia, and Provence. It is said that it attains greater perfection in the east than in the south, and that it is rarely found in a western and never in a northern aspect. It is found attached to rocks embedded in a muddy sea bottom, in which it flourishes more than in' a clear or sandy bed. In colour it varies through all shades of red, from a deep crimson to a delicate rose pink or flesh colour, fine tints of which are very rare and highly prized. It is also sometimes obtained of a milk white colour.

From the Middle Ages downwards the securing of the right to the coral fisheries on the African coasts was an object of considerable rivalry among the Mediterranean communities of Europe. Previous to the 16th century they were controlled by the Italian republics. For a short period the Tunisian fisheries were secured by Charles V. to Spain; but the monopoly soon fell into the hands of the French, who held the right till the Revolutionary Government in 1793 threw the trade open. For a short period (about 1806) the British Government controlled the fisheries, and now they are again in the hands of French authorities. Previous to the French Revolution much of the coral trade centred in Marseilles; but since that period, both the procuring of the raw material and the working of it up into the various forms in which it is used have become peculiarly Italian industries, centring largely in Naples, Rome, and Genoa. Although foreign crafts have to pay heavy dues for the right to fish on the Algerian coasts, the great majority of the vessels and crews belong to Torre del Greco. Two classes of boats engage in the pursuit,—a large size of from 12 to 14 tons, manned by ten or twelve hands, and a small size of 3 or 4 tons, with a crew of five or six. The large boats, dredging from March to October, collect from 650 to 850 lb of coral, and the small, working throughout the year, collect from 390 to 500 lb. The Algerian reefs are divided into ten portions, of which only one is fished annually,—ten years being considered sufficient for the proper growth of the coral. No reliable estimates of the amount and value of coral obtained annually exist; but in 1873 the Algerian fisheries alone, employing 311 vessels, manned by 3150 sailors, yielded raw coral valued at £113,000.

The range of value of the various qualities of coral, according to colour and size, is exceedingly wide, and notwithstanding the steady Oriental demand its price is considerably affected by the fluctuations of fashion. While the price of the finest tints of rose pink may range from £80 to £120 per oz., ordinary red-coloured small pieces sell for about £2 per oz., and the small fragments called collette, used for children’s necklaces, cost about 5s. per oz. In China large spheres of good coloured coral command high prices, being in great requisition for the button of office worn by the mandarins. It also finds a ready market throughout India and in Central Asia; and with the negroes of Central Africa and of America it is a favourite ornamental substance.
