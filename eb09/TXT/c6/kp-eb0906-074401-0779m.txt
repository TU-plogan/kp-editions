CUZCO, a city of southern Peru, the capital of a province of the same name, the ancient capital of the empire of the Incas, and still one of the most important cities of the republic, in 13° 3Γ S. lat. and 73° 3' W. long., 11,380 feet above the sea, and 350 miles E.S.E. of Lima. It stands at the head of a fertile valley, nine miles in length, running from south-east to north-west, and bounded by mountains of considerable elevation. Over the city on the north side rises the famous hill of Sacsahuaman, crowned with the old fortress of the Incas, and separated from the mountains by the deep ravines of the streams called the Huatanay and Rodadero. The chief portion of the city is built between the two streams, with its great plaza in the centre. To westward of the Huatanay are two more fine squares, these of the Cabildo and of San Francisco. The houses of the city are built of stone, the lower portion of massive masonry of the times of the Incas, with a light modem superstructure roofed with red tile; the streets are at right angles, and afford fine vistas. The principal buildings are the cathedral, the convent of San Domingo (on a part of the site of the ancient Inca temple of the Sun), the Cabildo or Government house, a university founded in 1598, the College of Science and Arts, the Library and Museum of Incarial Antiquities, and various churches. The trade of Cuzco is chiefly in linen, wool, cotton, gold and silver work, leather, and sugar. The population, estimated at about 50,000, is chiefly Indian. The roads from Cuzco to other parts of Peru, especially that one which leads towards Quito, are most remarkable for their frail suspension bridges over the deep chasms of the Andes. A railroad is projected to unite Cuzco with the line which has been completed from the coast through Arequipa towards Puno on Lake Titicaca.

The province of Cuzco, the limits of which were somewhat curtailed in the formation of the new province of Abancay in 1873, lies partly on the eastern cordillera of the Andes, and slopes thence into the forest plains of the interior, along the tributaries of the Ucayali and Marañon, to the frontier of Brazil and Bolivia.
