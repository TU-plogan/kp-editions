COX, Richard (1499-1581), born at Whaddon, Buckinghamshire, was educated at Eton, and afterwards at King’s College, Cambridge, of which he became a fellow in 1519. He was «invited to Oxford by Cardinal Wolsey; but having adopted the Reformed opinions, he was stripped of his preferment, and thrown into prison. On his release, however, he was appointed master of Eton School, and in 1541 he was made prebendary of Ely Cathedral. Through the influence of Cranmer he was chosen tutor to Prince Edward; and on the accession of that prince he was sworn of the Privy Council, and made king’s almoner. Under Mary he was stripped of his preferments, and committed to the Marshalsea; he escaped, however, to Strasburg, where he resided with Peter Martyr. By Elizabeth he was elevated to the see of Ely. Cox was a man of considerable learning. He was distinguished by the violence of the measures which he recommended for the extirpation of Popery and dissent.

He translated the four gospels, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Epistle to the Romans, in the Bishops’ Bible, and had a considerable share in compiling and revising the liturgy; and he wrote Two Latin Orations on the Dispute between Dr Tresham and Peter Martyr, London, 1549, and Resolutions of some Questions concerning the Sacrament, printed in the Collection of Records at the end of Burnet’s History of the Reformation.
