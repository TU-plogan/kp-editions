CORONA, in astronomy, the name given to the phenomenon seen round the sun during a total eclipse. This phenomenon is doubtless a complex one, and comprises effects due (1) to the sunâ€™s surroundings or the various layers of its atmosphere, (2) to the sunlight falling on something between us and the sun, and (3) to certain physiological effects in the eye. These effects will be discussed under the heading Sun. In the meantime it may be stated that the solar part of the phenomenon comprises the [9:6:429] chromosphere, the layer of brightly incandescent hydrogen, with other included metallic vapours, which lies immediately over that interior part of the sun which we ordinarily see; the prominences or red flames, which are local uprisings of the chromosphere; and outside all, the coronal atmosphere, which consists, so far as is yet known, of hydrogen less brightly incandescent than that in the chromosphere, and of an unknown substance, the vapour density of which appears to be less than that of hydrogen.
