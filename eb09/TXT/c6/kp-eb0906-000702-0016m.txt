CLINTON, a town of the United States, in Worcester countv, Massachusetts, on the Nashua River, about 32 miles west of Boston, at the junction of several railway lines. It is the seat of extensive manufacturing activity, chiefly expended in the production of cotton cloths, woollen carpets, boots and shoes, combs, and machinery. The Lancaster mills rank as perhaps the best in the United States; and the wire cloth company has the credit of being the first to weave wire by the power-loom. Population in 1870, 5429.
