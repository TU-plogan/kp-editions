COORG, a province of Southern India, near the centre of the Western Ghats, between ll 0 56' and 12° 45' N. lat. and 75° 25' and 76° 13' E. long., is bounded by Mysore, Malabar, and South Kanara, and has an area of 2000 square miles. It is a mountainous district, presenting throughout a series of wooded hills and deep valleys; the lowest elevations are 3000 feet above sea-level. The loftiest peak, Tandiandamol, has an altitude of 5781 feet; Pushpagiri, another peak, is 5682 feet high. The principal river is the Cauvery, or Kaveri, which rises on the eastern side of the Western Ghats, and with its tributaries drains the greater part of Coorg. Besides these there are several large streams that take their rise in Coorg. In the rainy season, which lasts during the continuance of the southwest monsoon, or from June to the end of September, the rivers flow with violence and great rapidity. In July and August the rainfall is excessive, and the month of November is often showery. The yearly rainfall may exceed 160 inches; in the dense jungle tract it reaches from 120 to 150; in the bamboo district from 60 to 100 inches. The climate, though humid, is on the whole healthy; it is believed to have been rendered hotter and drier of late years by the clearing of forest land. Coorg has an average temperature of about 60° Fahr., the extremes being 52° and 82°. The hottest season is in April and May. In the direction of Mysore the whole country is thickly wooded; but to the westward the forests are more open. The flora of the jungle includes Miclιdia (Chumpak), Mesita (Iron-wood), Diospyros (Ebony and other species), Cedrela Tomia (White cedar), Chickrassia tubularis (Red cedar), Calophyllum angustifolium (Poon spar), Canarium strictum (Black Dammar tree), Artocarpus, Dipterocarpus, Garcinia, Fuonymus, Cinnamomum iners, Myristica, Vaccinium, Myctaceae, Melastomaceae, Rubus (three species), and a rose. In the undergrowth are found cardamom, areca, plantain, canes, wild pepper, tree and other ferns, and arums. In the forest of the less thickly-wooded bamboo country in the west of Coorg the trees most common are the Dιdbergia latifolia (Black wood), Pterocarpus Marsupium (Kino tree), Terminalia coriacea (Mutti), Lagerstròmia parυiflora (Benteak), Conocarpus latifolius (Dindul), Bassia latifolia, Butea frondosa, Nauclea parviflora, and several acacias, with which, in the eastern part of the district, teak and sandalwood occur. Among the fauna may be mentioned the elephant, tiger, tiger-cat, cheetah or hunting leopard, wild dog, elk, bison, wild boar, several species of deer, hares, monkeys, the buceros and various other birds, the cobra di capello, and a few alligators. The most interesting antiquities of Coorg are the earth redoubts (kunnidegs), which are from 15 to 25 feet high, and provided with a ditch 10 feet deep by 8 or 10 feet wide. Their linear extent is reckoned at between 500 and 600 miles. The exports of Coorg are mainly rice, coffee, and cardamoms; and the only important manufacture is a kind of coarse blanket. Fruits of many descriptions, especial 1 y oranges, are produced in abundance, and are of excellent quality. The Coorgs, of whom the Kodagas are the chief tribe, constitute thirteen castes. They are of Dravidian origin, and retain the devil-worship of their ancestors; they speak a dialect of Canarese. They are a well-formed, bold and active, but ignorant and superstitious race. The strange institution of polyandry prevalent among them, according to which the wives of the brothers of a family are common property, appears to have arisen from the necessity of counteracting the exterminating influence of wars by making the brothers of the slain the rightful husbands of their widows. The principal towns of Coorg are Merkara, the capital, Fraserpett, Somwarpett, Periapatam, and Verajenderpetta. In 1872 Coorg contained 510 villages, and its population numbered 168,312.

Previous to its annexation to British India, Coorg was governed by a line of rajahs of the Nair caste of Hindus, mentioned in history as early as the year 1583. The ascendency of the last family of these rulers dates from the year 1632. Its princes retained their independence till the year 1773, when Hyder Ali, who had long sought the subjugation of the country, took advantage of a dispute about the succession to seize upon the sovereignty, and imprisoned the rajah. The latter subsequently effected his escape from captivity, and drove the armies of Tippoo Sultan out of Coorg; and in the war against Tippoo in the year 1791 he proved a useful auxiliary to the British. On the defeat of Tippoo a treaty was entered into between the East India Company and Viraraja of Coorg, who dying in 1807, left the throne to his daughter Devammaji. Lin-garaja, her uncle, who now usurped the throne, was succeeded in 1820 by his son, Viraraja. This monarch’s misgovernment and oppression of Coorg brought upon him at length the armed interference of Lord William Bentinck; in April 1834 he was deposed by General Fraser, and his dominions were annexed to British territory. Since then the revenue has improved, cultivation has been extended, and the general prosperity of the country has steadily increased.
