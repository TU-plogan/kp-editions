Educated in AVestminster School and Gloucester Hall, Oxford, he entered the household of Prince Henry, the eldest son of James I. In 1611 he published a curious account of a walking tour, under the title of CoryaU's Crudities hastily gobbled zip in Five Months' Travels in France, Italy, àc. At the command of Prince Henry, verses in mock praise of the author (ιfterwards published by themselves as the Odcombian Banquet) were added to the volume, written in a number of languages, and some in a mixture of languages, by Ben Jonson, Donne, Chapman, Drayton, and many other of the literary men of the time. In the same year he published a second volume of a similar kiud, Coryatt ’ s Crambe, or his Coleworte twice Sodden. In 1612 he set out on another journey, which also was mostly performed on foot.
