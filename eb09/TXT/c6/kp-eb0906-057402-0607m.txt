CREUTZ, Gustaf Philip, Count, a Swedish poet, was born in Finland in 1729. After concluding his studies in Abo he received a post in the Court of Chancery at Stockholm in 1751. Here he met Count Gyllenborg, with whom his name is as firmly united as Beaumont’s with Fletcher’s. Their friendship woke the poetic vein in each of the young men, and they formed, in unison, the one great figure in the poetic literature of Sweden in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the eminent poetess, Fru Nordenflycht, the volumes they published together becamo widely admired; to their own generation they seemed equal in fame, but posterity has given the palm of genius to Creutz. His greatest work is contained in the 1762 volume, the idyll of Ätis and Camilla; the exquisite little pastoral entitled Daphne was published at the same time, and the generous and loving Gyllenborg was the first to proclaim and to delight in the supremacy of his friend. In 1763 Creutz practically closed his poetical career; he went to Spain as ambassador, and after three years to Paris in the same capacity. In France he enjoyed the friendship of all the great literati of the day, especially of Marmontel. In 1783 Gustavus III. recalled him and heaped honours upon him, but he died soon after, on the 30th of October 1785. Åtis and Camilla was long the most admired poem in the Swedish language; it is written in a spirit of pastoral which is now to some degree faded, but in comparison with most of the other productions of the time it is freshness itself, Creutz introduced a melody and grace into the Swedish tongue which it lacked before, and he has been styled “the last artificer of the language.”
