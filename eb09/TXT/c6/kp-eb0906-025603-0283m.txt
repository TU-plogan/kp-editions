CONEGLIANO, a town of Italy, in the province of Treviso, on the River Mutega, with a station on the railway from Venice to Trieste, about 36 miles north of the former city. It is commanded by a large castle on a neighbouring height, and it possesses a cathedral, two conventual buildings, a number of benevolent institutions, and a triumphal arch erected in honour of the Emperor Francis I. of Austria. Several of the private houses were adorned with frescoes by Pordenone; and the cathedral and the church of S. Fiore preserve the handiwork of Ci ma da Conegliano, an eminent artist born in the town. Marshal Mouncey bore the title of duke of Conegliano. Population about 6000.
