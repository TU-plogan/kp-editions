COLLÉ, Charles (1709-1783), dramatist and songwriter, was the son of a notary, and was born at Paris. At a very early age he began to study the writings of Marot and La Fontaine, of Chapelle and Molière, to take delight in the theatre, and to be specially interested in the rhymes of Jean Heguanier, then the most famous maker of couplets in Paris. From a notary’s office Collé, who seems to have had little taste for legal studies, was transferred to that of Μ. de Meulan, the receiver-general of finance. When about seventeen, however, he made the acquaintance of Piron, and afterwards, through Gallet, of Panard. The example of these three masters of the vaudeville, while determining his vocation, made him diffident; and for some time he composed nothing but amphigouris — verses whose merit was measured by their unintelligibility. The friendship of the younger Crébillon, however, diverted him from this byway of art, and the establishment in 1729 of the famous “Caveau” gave him a field for the display of his fine talent for popular song. In 1739 the Society of [9:6:142] the Caveau, which numbered among its members Helvetius, Duclos, Gentil-Bernard, Boucher, Rameau, Piron, and the two Crébillons, was dissolved, and was not reconstituted till twenty years afterwards. Meanwhile, the Regent Orleans, who was an excellent comic actor, particularly in representations of low life, and who had been looking out for an author to write suitable parts for him, made Collé his secretary. It was for the duke and his associates that Collé composed the greater part of his Théâtre de Société. Based on the stories of the younger CrébiHon and La Fontaine, all the pieces in this collection, while remarkable for ease and gaiety, in point of delicacy are such as might be expected from their source and their avowed object. In 1763, however, Collé, whose jestings the duke had rewarded with a place under Government, produced at the Théâtre Français Dupuis et Des-ronais, a sentimental comedy, which met with a decided success, and which was followed in 1771 by La Veuve, an attempt in the same direction, and a complete failure. In 1774 appeared La Partie de Chasse de Henri Quatre (partly taken from Dodsley’s King and the Miller of Mansfield), Collé’s last and best play. From 1758 to 1782, besides these and a multitude of songs, Collé was writing his Journal Historique, a curious collection of literary and personal strictures and animadversions on his boon companions as well as on their enemies, on Piron as on Voltaire, on La Harpe as on Corneille. In 1783, having outlived the greater part of his old friends, and grieving for the loss of his wife, to whom he was greatly attached, Collé died. He is best remembered by his lyrics, which form an important link in the chain of style through which the chanson, that peculiarly French form of the song, has passed. They are frank and jovial, though often licentious, and are remarkable for wit and amiability no less than for the artistic management of the refrain and for their popular attractions. The subjects are love and wine; occasionally, however, as in the famous lyric (1756) on the capture of Port Mahon, for which the author received a pension of 600 livres, the note of patriotism is struck with no unskilful hand, while in many others Collé shows himself possessed of considerable epigrammatic force. See Grimm’s Correspondance, and Taillefer’s Tableau Historique de V Esprit et du Caractère des Littératures Françaises.
