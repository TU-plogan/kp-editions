CRIMMITZSCHAU, or Krimmitzschau, a manufacturing town of Saxony, in the circle of Zwickau, and seven miles N.N.W. of the town of that name, on both banks of the Pleisse, and on the Saxon Western State Railway, 760 feet above the sea. Brewing was formerly the most important industry, but woollen weaving and cotton weaving have now taken the chief place; the manufacture of machinery has also become very considerable. Limeburning is carried on in the neighbourhood, and the surrounding district is noted for its wheat growing. Population (1875), 17,649.
