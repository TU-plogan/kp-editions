CONRART, or Conrard, Valentin (1603-1675), one of the founders of the French Academy, was born at Paris in 1603, and was educated, under Calvinist parents, for a commercial life. After his father’s death, however, he turned his attention to literature, made himself proficient in his own language, and in those of Italy and Spain, and being brought into contact with men of letters, soon acquired a reputation, which for many years he did nothing to sup port. He was made councillor and secretary to the king; and this, together with a benevolent character, a faultless taste, and a certain charm of disposition and conversation, gained him a host of friends in the highest circles. Some, however, refused to join in the applause that everywhere greeted Òonrart, and posterity has echoed their verdict. His literary reputation has passed away almost as completely as that of his friend Chapelain; and a certain distinction of style, recognized by Sainte-Beuve, is all that he is now credited with. In 1629 Conrart’s house became the resort of a knot of literary men, who met to talk over professional subjects, and to read for advice and approval such work as they produced. The indiscretion of one of the number led to an involuntary notoriety, and to the influx into the meetings of the club of many strangers. Among these was Boisrobert, Richelieu’s newsmonger and jester, who reported to his patron what he had seen and heard. The cardinal offered the society his protection, and in this way (1634) the French Academy was created. Conrart was unanimously elected secretary, and discharged the duties of his post for forty-three years, till his death in 1675. The intelligence and conscientiousness he displayed in this capacity are perhaps his greatest titles to distinction. To the last he rigidly adhered to his hereditary faith.
