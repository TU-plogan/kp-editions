CRAIG, John(c. 1512-1600), one of the Scottish Reformers, was born about 1512. He was educated at the university oí St Andrews, and entered the Dominican order. But, being suspected of heresy, he was cast into prison. Retiring to the Continent, he obtained the patronage of Cardinal Pole, and for some years taught in Dominican schools, and performed other services for the order. He was converted to Protestantism by the Institutes of Calvin, and, having made a brave confession of his heresy before the Inquisition, he was condemned to be burnt. But on the eve of his execution Pope Paul IV. died, and the mob broke open the prisons. Craig fled to Vienna, and the emperor, Maximilian IL, refused to surrender him to the Inquisition. He now returned to his native country, and after preaching for some time in Edinburgh became coadjutor to Knox. It was he who proclaimed the banns of marriage between Queen Mary and Bothwell, but he openly denounced their union. On the death of Knox in 1672 he naturally succeeded to the leadership of the Scottish Church. He took the most prominent part in drawing up the Second Boole of Discipline, and he was the author of the First Covenant, otherwise called the King's Confession (1581), and of Craig' 8 Catechism (1592), which was for half a century in general use in Scotland. But though he was bold enough to rebuke the king in his sermons, he yielded to his comïnands, and signed a declaration, promising obedience to the bishops and submission to an Act that had been passed forbidding the assembling of church courts without royal licence. Craig’s coadjutor and successor was Andrew Melville.
