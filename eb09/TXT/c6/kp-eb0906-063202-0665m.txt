+====================================================================+


CRUSIUS, Christian August (1715-1775), after Buddaeus the most distinguished theological opponent of the Wolfian philosophy and critical methods, was born on the 10th of January 1715, at Leuna, in Merseburg, a division of Prussian Saxony, and passed to the university of Leipsic in 1734. After attending the usual classes, he became extraordinary professor of philosophy in Leipsic in 1744, professor of theology in 1750, and theological principal in 1755. He died on the 18th of October 1775. Two of the great objects of his life were to place philosophy on a thoroughly satisfactory basis for the future, and to bring philosophical conclusions into harmony with orthodox theology. The university was divided by the disputes that were rife into two parties—the “Ernestianer” and the “Crusianer.” The former contended for a purely grammatical interpretation of Scripture, and carried out their theory to its logical consequences. They thus subjected the sacred writings to the same laws of exposition as are applied to other ancient books. Ernesti, adopting the principles he had employed in dealing with the classics, looked at the Bible from a purely philological stand-point. Crusius, on the other hand, explained Scripture in the light of the labours of the church and the usually received theological system. This had great influence on his philosophical position. He had inherited a bias against the W olfian views from his teacher Rüdiger; and numerous works were issued by him on logic, metaphysics, psychology, and moral philosophy—all with a direct controversial bearing. The system of Crusius was not successful, but it had a few very enthusiastic supporters. His mysticism and sincere religious spirit endeared him to the Pietists and the followers of Zinzendorf, who would naturally regard him as an able opponent of the extreme rationalizing tendencies (Aufklärung) of the time. His views of prophecy, too, and of its important connection with the Christian economy, had considerable influence on Hengstenberg and Delitzsch. The principal works of Crusius are Hypomnemata, ad theologiam propheticam and his Moral Theology. The latter is in two parts. In the first, taking revelation as his starting point, he combats the Wolfian idea of human perfection, and treats of the depravity, conversion, and sanctification of man. He seems to have held, like Dr Wardlaw, that natural, as distinguished from Christian, ethics are not legitimate. The second part is devoted more specially to morals. The book, although prolix, is animated by genuine religious feeling. Although Crusius had great influence on many of his contemporaries, he unfortunately outlived his reputation. He was a profound, subtle, and' original thinker, and was, perhaps, drawn into mysticism by his attempts to reconcile theology and philosophy. His works have fallen into the background; but he is still remembered for his profound learning, unfeigned piety, and purity and earnestness of character. Few controversialists have left behind them so stainless a name.
