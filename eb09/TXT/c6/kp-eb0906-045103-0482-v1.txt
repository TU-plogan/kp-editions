COSTELLO, Louisa Stuart (1799-1870), an historical and miscellaneous writer, elder sister of the preceding, was born in Ireland in 1799. Her father dying while she was young, during the occupation of France by the allies, she aided in tho support of her mother and brother by her skill as an artist. At the age of sixteen she published a volume of verse entitled The Maid of the Cyprus Isle, and other poems. This was followed in 1825 by Bongs of a Stranger, dedicated to W. L. Bowles. Ten years later appeared her Specimens of the Early Poetry of France, which was illustrated by beautifully executed illuminations, the work of her brother and herself. It was dedicated to Moore, and procured her his friendship as well as that of Sir Walter Scott. Henceforth literature was the labour of her life. Her principal works are— A Summer among the Bocages and Vines (1840); The Queen's Poisoner (or The Queen-Μ other), an historical romance (1841); Béarn and the Pyrenees (1844); Memoirsof Eminent Englishwomen (1844); The Rose Garden of Persia (1845), a series of translations from Persian poets, with illuminations by herself and her brother; The Falls, Lakes, and Mountains of North Wales (1845); Clara Fane (1848), a novel; Memoirs of Mary of Burgundy (1853); and Memoirs of Anne of Brittany (1855).
