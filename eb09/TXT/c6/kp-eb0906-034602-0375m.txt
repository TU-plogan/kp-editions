COPIAPO, an inland town of Chili, capital of the province of Atacama, is situated on a stream of the same [9:6:347] name about 35 miles from the sea, in 27 β 36' S. lat., 70° 23' W. long. The streets of the town, which was founded in 1734 by Count José de Manso, are straight and wide, with side pavements; but the houses are low and of timber, excepting in the streets Chañarcillo and Atacama, where they are built with more elegance and of more solid material. The principal square is 403 feet on each side, with flowers and shrubs in the centre surrounded by rows of shady pepper trees; while at the western end of the town is an avenue 52 feet broad and half a mile long with four rows of willow trees. Copiapo is connected by rail with the port of Caldera, 50 miles westward, and with the surrounding great mining districts, to which it owes its importance. From its situation in one of the driest regions of America, water is scarce, and the stream Copiapo is all utilized before it reaches the sea. Population, 12,000.
