COLERIDGE, Sara (1802-1852), was the fourth child and only daughter of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and his wife Sarah Fricker of Bristol. She was born December 22, 1802, at Greta Hall, Keswick, the residence of her parents, where they were shortly afterwards joined by Southey and his wife, who was Mrs Coleridge’s sister, and by Mrs Lovell, a third sister, and widow of the young quaker poet, Robert Lovell. Here, after 1803, they all lived together; but Coleridge was often away from home; and “Uncle Southey” was a pater familias. The Wordsworths at Grasmere were their neighbours; and the children of the three families grew up together. Wordsworth, in his poem, the Triad, has left us a description, or “poetical glorification,” as Sara Coleridge calls it, of the three girls—his own daughter Dora, Edith Southey, and Sara Coleridge, the “last of the three, though eldest born.” Greta Hall was Sara Coleridge’s home until her marriage; and the little Lake colony of poetical and speculative genius seems to have been her only school. Guided by Southey, and w ith his ample library at her command, she read by herself the chief Greek and Latin classics, and before she was five-and-twenty had learnt French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

In 1822 Sara Coleridge published a translation in three large volumes of Dobrizhoffer’s Account of the Ábipones, undertaken in connection with Southey’s Tale of Paraguay, which had been suggested to him by Dobrizhoffer’s volumes; and Southey alludes to his niece, the translator (canto iii. stanza 16), where he speaks of the pleasure the old missionary w ould have felt if

“ . . . .he could in Merlin’s glass have seen

By whom his tomes to speak our tongue were taught.” [9:6:139] In less grandiloqent terms, Charles Lamb, writing about the Tale of Paraguay to Southey in 1825, says, “How she Dobrizhoffered it all out, puzzles my slender Latiuity to conjecture.” In 1825 her second work appeared, a translation from the mediaeval French, in 2 volumes, called The Right Joyous and Pleasant History of the Feats, Jests, and Prouesses of the Chevalier Bayard, the Good Knight without Fear and without Reproach: By the Loyal Servant.

In September 1829, at Crosthwaite Church, Keswick, after an engagement of seven years’ duration, Sara Coleridge was married to her cousin, Henry Nelson Coleridge, then a Chancery barrister in London. The first eight years of her married life were spent in a little cottage on Downshire Hill, in the town of Hampstead. There four of her children were born, of whom two survived. In 1834 Mrs Coleridge published her Pretty Lessons in Verse for Good Children; with some Lessons in Latin in Easy Rhyme. These were originally written for the instruction of her own children. On their publication they became very popular; aud a new edition has been lately published by Henry S. King & Co. In 1837 the Coleridges removed to Chester Place, Regent’s Park; and in the same year appeared Phantasmion, a Fairy Tale, Sara Coleridge’s longest original work. An edition of this also was published in 1874 by Henry S. King & Co., with a preface by Lord-Chief-Justice Coleridge. The Songs of Phantasmion were much admired at the time by Leigh 1 I unt and other critics; and Mr Justice Coleridge is not afraid to say of them in his preface that they are “surely worthy of any great lyrical writer.” Without meriting such praise as this, however, some of these songs, such as “Sylvan Stay” and “One Face Alone,” are extremely graceful and musical, and the whole fairy tale is noticeable for the beauty of the story and the richness of its language.

In 1843 Mr Henry Coleridge died, leaving to his widow the unfinished task of editing her father’s works. To these she added some compositions of her own, among which are the Essay on Rationalism, with a special application to the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration, appended to Coleridge’s Aids to Reflection, a Preface to the Essays on his Own Times, by S. T. Coleridge, and the Introduction to the Biographia Literaria. During the last few years of her life Sara Coleridge was a confirmed invalid. Shortly before she died she amused herself by writing a little autobiography for her daughter. This, which reaches only to her ninth year, was completed by her daughter, and published in 1873, together with some of her letters, under the title Memoirs and Letters of Sara Coleridge. These letters show a cultured and highly speculative mind. They contain many apt criticisms of known people and books, and are specially interesting for their allusions to Wordsworth and the Lake Poets. Sara Coleridge died at Chester Place, May 3, 1852, and was buried by the side of her father, mother, and husband, in Highgate churchyard.
