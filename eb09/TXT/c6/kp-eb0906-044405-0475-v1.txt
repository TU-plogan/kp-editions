COS (or Stanko, or Stanchio, by corruption from tç ràv Kω), an island in that part of the Turkish archipelago which was anciently known as the Myrtoan Sea, not far from the south-western corner of Asia Minor, at the mouth of the Gulf of Halicarnassus, or Bay of Budrum. Its total length is about 25 miles, and its circumference about 74. A considerable chain of mountains, known to the ancients as Oromedon, or Prion, extends along the southern coast with hardly a break except near the island of Nisyros; so that the greatest versant and most important streams turn towards the north. The whole island is little more than a mass of limestone, and consequently unites great aridity in the drier mountain regions with the richest fertility in the alluvial districts. As the attention of the islanders is mainly directed to the culture of their vineyards, which yield the famous Sultana raisins, a considerable proportion of the arable land is left untouched, though wheat, barley, and maize are sown in some quarters, and melons and sesamum seed appear among the exports. Formerly one of the most valuable products of the island was its lemons and oranges, but since the destruction of the trees by a severe frost in 1850, these fruits hardly take any place in the market. The wild olive is abundant enough, but neglected; and cotton, though it thrives well, is only grown in small quantities. As the principal harbour, in spite of dredging operations, is only fit for smaller vessels, the island is not of so much commercial importance as it would otherwise be; but since 1868 it has been regularly visited by steamers, and about fifty vessels annually enter the harbour. The only town in the island is Cos, or Stanko, at the eastern extremity, remarkable for its fortress, founded by the knights of Rhodes, and for the gigantic plane-tree in the public square. The fortress is supposed to occupy the site of the temple of AEsculapius so celebrated in antiquity, and it preserves in its walls a number of interesting architectural fragments. The plane-tree has a circumference of about 30 feet, and its huge and heavy branches have tobe supported by pillars; of its age there is no certain knowledge, but the popular tradition connects it with Hippocrates. The town is supplied by an aqueduct, about four miles in length, with water from a hot chalybeate spring, which is likewise named after the great physician of the island. The villages of Pyli and Kephalas are interesting, the former for the Greek tomb of a certain Chamylos, and the latter for a castle of the knights of St John and the numerous inscriptions that prove that it occupies the site of an ancient city called Isthmos. The population of the island amounts to about 10,400 souls, of whom about a third are Mahometans, and the rest, with the exception of a dozen Jewish families, Christians.

Cos is said to have been colonized from Epidaurus, the great Peloponnesian centre of the worship of Aesculapius, and it is certain that the Aesculapian cultus had a remarkable hold in the island. For a time the city was a member of the Dorian Pentapolis which]ιeld its federal assemblies in the Triopian headland; but at a later date it became subject to the Athenians by whom it was fortified. The Emperor Claudius made it a free state, and to Antoninus Pius it was indebted for restoration from the effects of a great eartl - quake. During the Greek and Roman period the island was famous for its purple and its wines; the Coan robes were celebrated by the poets for the delicacy and transparency of their texture; and it also enjoyed a nobler celebrity as the birthplace of Hippocrates the physician and Apelles the artist. In modern times its history presents few details, the most interesting fact being its possession by the knights of St John.
