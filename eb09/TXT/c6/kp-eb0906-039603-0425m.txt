CORINGA, a seaport town of British India, in the collectorate of Godavery and presidency of Madras, is situated in 82° 19' E. long, and 16° 49' N. lat., on the estuary of a branch of the Godavery River. The harbour is protected from the swell of the sea by the southward projection of Point Godavery, and affords a shelter to vessels during the south-west monsoon. Across its entrance is a bar, which shows a depth of about 15 feet at spring tides. The repairing and building of small coasting ships [9:6:397] is a staple industry of Coringa. The chief exports are teak, salt, and piece-goods; the imports are silk, paper, and copper. In 1787 a gale from the north-east occasioned an inundation which swept away the greater part of the town with its inhabitants; and in 1832 another storm desolated the place, carrying vessels into the fields and leaving them aground. Of Europeans the French, who still hold the neighbouring settlement of Yanaon, were the first to establish themselves at Coringa. In 1759 the English took possession of the town, and erected a factory five miles to the south of it.
