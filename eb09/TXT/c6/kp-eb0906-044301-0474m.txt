CORUNNA (Spanish, La Coruña; French, La Corogne; English, formerly often The Groyne), a city and seaport of Spain, the capital at one time of Galicia, and now of a province of its own name, is situated on the north west coast, 43 miles north of Santiago de Com-postelh, in 43° 23' N. lat. and 8° 27' W. long. It is of first rank both as a fortress and a port, and is the seat of a superior court and a commercial tribunal. There is an upper and a lower town, the former built on the east side of a small peninsula, and the latter on the isthmus connecting the peninsula with the mainland. The upper town is the more ancient, and is still surrounded by walls and bastions and defended by a citadel; but it has been gradually outgrown by the lower, wshich, though at first a mere Pescaderia, or fishing-village, is now comparatively well built, and has several broad and handsome streets. There is little remarkable in the public buildings, though they include six churches, of which Santiago dates from the 11 th and the Colegiata from the l3th century, five convents, two hospitals, a palace for the captain-general of Galicia, a theatre, a school of navigation, an arsenal, and barracks. The harbour, though of rather difficult access, is perfectly secure, and it is defended by several forts, of which the most important are San Diego on the east and San Antonio on the west. These fortifications are of little practical importance on the land side, as they are commanded by a hill that overlooks the city. The so-called Tower of Hercules to the north, supposed to have been originally built by the Romans, has been raised in modern times to a height of upwards of 360 feet, and is now crowned with a fine revolving light visible for a distance of twelve miles to sea. English, French, and Belgian steamers call here on their way to South America for mails or emigrants; and upwards of 300 merchant ships, mostly British, enter the port every year. The trade consists mainly in the export of fat cattle—20,000 of which were sent to England in 1873,—eggs, meats, fruits, and sardines; and in the importation of general grocery-goods and manufactured articles. Besides a large Government tobacco-factory, which employs about 3000 women, there are in the city two glass-factories, two cotton-factories, and several steam saw-mills and sardine-curing establishments; and the herring and pilchard fisheries give employment to a number of the inhabitants. According to the census of 1869, the population of the town and suburbs was about 30,000; in 1874 it was estimated at 40,000.

Corunna, possibly at first a Phoenician settlement, is identified with the ancient Ardobrica, a seaport mentioned by Mela in the country of the Artabri, from whom the name of Portus Artabrõrum was given to the bay on which the city is situated. In the Middle Ages, and probably at an earlier period, it was called Caronium, a name which is much more probably the origin of the present designation than the Latin Columna which is sometimes put forward. The harbour has always been of considerable importance, but it is only in comparatively modem times that it has made a figure in history. In 1588 it gave shelter to the Invincible Armada; and in 1598 the town was captured and burned by the English under Drake and Norris. ' In 1747, and again in 1805, the bay was the scene of a naval victory of the English over the French; and in 1809 an action took place in the neighbourhood which has become one of the most celebrated in British military annals. The French under Marshal Soult attempted to prevent the embarkation of the English under Sir John Moore, but were successfully repulsed in spite of their numbers. Moore was mortally wounded in the engagement, and expired shortly after its termination. He was hastily buried on a bastion near the sea; and a monument in the Jardin de San Carlos raised by the British Government commemorates his bravery and intrepidity. In 1820 the town joined the revolutionary movement and declared the constitution, but in 1823 it had to capitulate to Bourck, the French general.
