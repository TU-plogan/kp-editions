COJUTEPEC, a town of Central America, in the republic of San Salvador and the department of Cuscatlan, about 15 miles east of the capital. It has a population of about 15,000, and from 1854 to 1858 it served as the seat of government instead of San Salvador, which had been ruined by an earthquake. In 1872 it took part in a revolutionary outbreak against the existing Government, and the Indian population unsuccessfully attacked the garrison. The town gives its name to a neighbouring volcano, which rises to a height of 5700 feet, and also to the extensive lake, otherwise known as the Lake of Ilopango, which lies a few miles to the south and gives rise to the Rio Jiboa.
