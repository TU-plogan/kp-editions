COMPIEGNE, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement, in the department of Oise, situated on the left bank of the Oise, which is there crossed by a handsome bridge of three arches, 36 miles east of Beauvais, on the railway between Paris and St Quentin, in 49° 25' 4" N. lat. and 2° 49' 35" E. long. It is famous as the occasional residence of the French kings from a very early period; and it possesses a considerable number of fine edifices. Among these may be mentioned the church of St Jacques, of the 13th century; Saint Antoine, of the 15th and 16th; the town house, a picturesque building of the late Gothic style, dating from the 16th; the theatre; and the royal palace, which is one of the most extensive and magnificent structures of the kind in France. It was erected mainly under Louis XV. and XVI., but large additions have been made in more recent times. The gardens are beautifully laid out, and in the neighbourhood is the famous forest of Compiègne, which covers an area of 30,000 acres, and includes the site of the camp constructed by Caesar in his campaign against the Bellovaci. The town is the seat of a civil and a. commercial tribunal, and has a communal college, a public library, and a museum in the town-hall. The principal manufactures are hosiery, muslins, ropes, and wooden wares; and there is a fair trade in corn and wood. Population in 1872, 11,859 in the town, and 12,281 in the commune.

Compiègne, or, as it is called in the Latin chronicles, Compendium, seems originally to have been a hunting-lodge of the early Frankish kings. It was enriched by Charles the Bald with two castles, and a Benedictine abbey dedicated to Saint Corneille, the monks of which retained down to the 18th century the privilege of acting for three days as lords of Compiègne, with full power to release prisoners, condemn the guilty, and even inflict sentence of death. It was i⅛ Compiègne that Louis the Débonnaire was deposed in 833; and at the siege of the town in 1430, Joan of Arc was taken prisoner by the English. The abbey church received the dust of Louis 11., Louis V., and Hugh the Great; and for a long time it had the distinction of possessing the oldest organ in France, a gift from Constantine Copronymus to Pepin the Short. In 1624 the town gave its name to a treaty of alliance concluded by Richelieu with the Dutch; and it was in the palace that Louis XV. gave welcome to Marie Antoinette, that Napoleon I. received Marie Louise of Austria, that Louis XVIII. entertained the Emperor Alexander of Russia, and that Leopold king of the Belgians was married to the Princess Louise. Under Napoleon III. it was the annual resort of the court during the hunting season, and thus became the scene of many a remarkable assembly. In 1871 the town was an important post of communication between France and Germany, [9:6:229]
