COLLOT D’HERBOIS, Jean Marie (1750-1796), a prominent actor in the French Revolution, was a Parisian actor. After figuring for some years at the principal provincial theatres of France and Holland, he became director of the playhouse at Geneva. He had from the first a share in the revolutionary tumult; but it was not until 1791 that he became a figure of importance. Then, however, by the publication of L ’ Almanach du Père Gérard, a tract designed to set forth, in hρmely style, the advantages of a constitutional government, he suddenly acquired great popularity. His renown was soon increased by his active interference on behalf of the Swiss of the Château-Vieux Regiment, condemned to the galleys for mutiny at Nancy. His efforts resulted in their liberation; he went himself to Brest in search of them; and a civic feast was decreed on his behalf and theirs, which gave occasion for one of the few poems published during his life by André Chénier. He next endeavoured to obtain the office of minister of justice, but was disappointed. The Tenth of August, however, placed him in the municipality of Paris. There he attached himself to Billaud-Varenne, and had with him a large share in bringing about the September Massacres. Having been elected a deputy for Paris to the Convention, he was among the first to demand the abolition of royalty; and from Nice, whither he had gone on an embassy, he voted the death of Louis XVI.—“sans sursis.” In the struggle between the Mountain and the Girondists he displayed great energy; and after the coup d'etat of May 31 (1793) be made himself conspicuous by his pitiless pursuit of the defeated party. In June he was made president of the Convention; and in September, with Billaud-Varenne, he was admitted to the Committee of Public Safety. He voted loudly and persistently for all the bloodiest and sternest measures. In November, after the Lyonese insurrection, he was sent with Fouché to punish the rebellious city, where, it is said, he had once been hissed as an actor. This he effected by putting about 1500 persons to death in one day. In May 1794 an attempt was made to assassinate Collot; but it only increased his popularity. In the struggle for mastery between Robespierre and Tallien, Collot took the part of the latter In spite, however, of his fierce attack on Robespierre he was expelled from the Committee of Public Safety, and was denounced in form by Lecointre. He defended himself, and was acquitted, but only to be denounced anew by Merlin, and to be condemned, with Billaud-Varenne, to transportation to Cayenne, where he died of fever a few months after his arrival.

Colbot d’Herbois wrote and adapted from the English and Spanish many plays, one of which, Le Paysan Magistrat, kept the stage for several years. L' Almanach du Père Gérard was reprinted (1792) under the title of Elrennes aux Amis de la Constitution Française, ou Entretiens du Père Gérard avec scs Concitoyens, Paris, 12mo.
