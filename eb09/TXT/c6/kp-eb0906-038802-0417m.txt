CORAY, Adamantius (1748-1833), a Greek scholar, was the son of a merchant of Smyrna. His grandfather, Professor Rhysius, had left a library to whoever of his grandsons should distinguish himself most at school in the study of ancient Greek. Adamantius won the prize, and a strong interest in literature was thence awakened in him. For a time, however, he devoted himself to commerce, carrying on the management of his father’s business affairs in Amsterdam. But in 1779 his father’s warehouse in Smyrna was destroyed by fire; and Coray was left free to follow his tastes. Two or three years after he removed to Montpellier, where he remained for six years, studying medicine, and supporting himself by translating German and English medical works into French. In 1788 he settled in Paris, where he died forty-five years later, at the age of eighty-five.

Coray’s chief works are his editions of Greek authors contained in his Bibliothèque hellénique and his πaρeρya ; and his editions of the Characters of Theophrastus, of the De Aëre, Aquis, et Locis of Hippocrates, and of the Aethiopica of Heliodorus, elaborately annotated.
