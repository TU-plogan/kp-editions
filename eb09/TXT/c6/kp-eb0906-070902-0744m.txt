CURAÇOA, or Curaçao, an island in the Caribbean Sea, lying off the north coast of Venezuela, in 12° N. lat., 69° W. long. It is 40 miles in length from N.W. to S.E., and 10 in average breadth; the area is 212 square miles. The island is hilly and deficient in water, being wholly dependent upon the rains; yet, owing to the industry of the Dutch planters, considerable quantities of sugar, cotton, indigo, tobacco, and maize are raised. A peculiar variety of orange, the Citrus Λurantium curassuviensis, grows abundantly, and furnishes the distinguishing ingredient in the liqueur which takes its name from the island. The principal export is salt. The shores, which are bold, are in some places deeply indented, and present several harbours, the chief of which is Santa Anna, on the south-west side of the island. The entrance to this, which is narrow, is protected by Fort Amsterdam and other batteries; but the harbour itself is large and secure, and is the port of the chief town Curaçoa, or Willemstad. The population in 1875 amounted to 23,972, about one-third being emancipated negroes. All belonged to the Roman Catholic Church, except about 2000 Protestants and 1000 Jews. The island was settled by the Spaniards about 1527, and was captured by the Dutch in 1634. It was taken by the English in 1798 and again in 1806, but was restored in 1814 to the Dutch, in whose possession it has since remained.
