COLNE, a market town of England, in the county of Lancaster, 26 miles north of Manchester, on a small affluent of the Calder, near the Liverpool and Leeds Canal, with a station on a branch of the Midland line. It is a place of great antiquity, and many Roman coins have been found on the site. As early as the 14th century it was the seat of a woollen manufacture; but its principal manufactures now are printed calicoes and mousselines-de-laine. The chief buildings are the parish church of St Bartholomew, an ancient edifice which has been frequently restored, and the cloth or piece-hall, in the Elizabethan style. The grammar school is interesting as the place where Archbishop Tillotson received his early education. In the neighbourhood are several limestone and slate quarries. Population in 1851, 6644; in 1871, 7335.
