CONECTE, Thomas, a French Carmelite monk and preacher, was born at Rennes. He travelled through Flanders and Picardy, denouncing the vices of the clergy and the extravagant dress of the women, especially their lofty head-dresses, or hennins. He ventured to teach that he who is a true servant of God need fear no Papal curse, that the Roman hierarchy is corrupt, and that marriage is permissible to the clergy, of whom only some have the gift of continence. He was listened to by immense congregations; and it is said that one of the means he employed to maintain his reputation as a preacher was never allowing himself to be seen in private. From Flanders, where his sumptuary reform disappeared with his departure, he passed to Italy, and, despite the opposition of Nicolas Kenton, provincial of the Carmelites, he introduced several changes into the rules of that order. But at length he was seized by order of the Pope, condemned, and burnt for heresy (1434).
