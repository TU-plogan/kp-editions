CTESIPHON, an ancient city in the south of Assyria, situated on the left bank of the Tigris, about twenty-five miles south-east of Baghdad. It is reported by Ammianus to have been founded by a Parthian, Varanes by name, of whose history nothing is known; it rose into importance when the city of Seleucia on the opposite bank began to decline.: and under the Parthian kings, who originally [9:6:678] selected it as a winter residence, it ultimately acquired the rank of the sole capital of their dominions. On the fall of the Parthian empire it naturally declined; but on the establishment of the Persian dynasty of the Sassanids it recovered somewhat of its prosperity, and was occasionally chosen as the residence of royalty on account of the pleasure-grounds and hunting-parks in the vicinity. At the time when it fell into the hands of the Roman emperor Severus (232 a.d.) its population must have been very great, as it furnished no fewer than 100,000 prisoners of war. About 263 it was besieged by Odenathus, king of Palmyra; and in the minority of Sapor II. it was taken by storm by a Mesopotamian chieftain named Thair. Though the emperor Julian gained the day in a great battle before the city, and its capture seems to have been one of the chief objects of his manoeuvres, he retired without attempting an investment. ¢ In 637 it was abandoned by Yezdejird, the last of the Sassanids, and seized by Sa’ad, the Arabian general, who found within its walls so extensive and costly a booty that, after the works of art and a fifth of the whole were set apart for the caliph, he was able to bestow 12,000 dirhems, or upwards of £300, on each of his 60,000 soldiers. After this date the destruction of the city seems to have been rapidly accomplished; and in the present day the site is marked by desolate ruins which, instead of preserving the ancient name of Ctesiphon or the more modern name of Maidan, are known to the people of the district as the burial-place of Soliman Pak, the barber of Mahomet. Amid the mounds of sun-dried bricks, one building still remains sufficiently entire to give some authentication to the glowing descriptions of the Arabian writers. This is the Takht-i-Khesra (throne of Chosroes), Tak-i-Khesra (arch of Chosroes), or, using the other form of Chosroes’s name, the arch of Nushirvan, which consists of the great central hall of the palace, built in all probability by the monarch whose name it perpetuates. According to Tabari, the edifice when complete was 450 feet in length, 180 feet in breadth, and 150 feet in height: adorned in front by a portico of twelve marble pillars of the noblest dimensions; and the vaulted hall, which had a height of 85 feet and a width of 72, was decorated with the signs of the zodiac in golden stars. The whole building appears from the remains to have been composed of baked bricks covered with a coating of plaster; but the Arabian writers speak of it as consisting of polished stone.
