CÖTE DOR, a department in the east of France, formed of the northern region of the old province of Burgundy. It is bounded N. by the department of Aube, N.E. by Haute· Marne, E. by Haute-Saône and Jura, S. by Saône-et-Loire, and W. by Nièvre and Yonne, and lies between 46° 55’ and 48’ 2' N. lat. The surface is mostly rugged. A chain of hills runs from north-east to south-west through the centre of the department, separating the basin of the Seine from that of the Saône, and forming the connecting-link between the Cévennes and the Vosges mountains. Extending southwards from Dijon is a portion of this range which, on account of the excellence of its vineyards, bears the name Côte d’Or, whence that of the department. The rivers are numerous but small, the only one navigable being the Saône. The Burgundy Canal, connecting the Rivers Saône and Yonne, traverses the department from south-east to north-west. The soil is generally stony, but rich. Wine in large quantities, cereals, fruit, beetroot, rape-seed, mustard, honey, flax, hemp, and hops are produced; and good horses, sheep, and cattle are reared. The iron mines furnish large quantities of ore; and anthracite, marble, lithographic stone, gypsum, and potter’s clay are worked. The manufactures include iron, steel, nails, tiles, oil, leather, grindstones, paper, cloth, sugar, beer, and spirits. The department is divided into the arrondissements of Dijon, Beaune, Châtillon, and Semur, containing 36 cantons and 717 communes. The chief town is Dijon. The total area is 3382 square miles, and the population in 1872 was 374,510.
