CRAPE is a silk fabric of a gauzy texture, having a peculiar crisp or crimpy appearance. It is woven of hard spun silk yarn ‘ in the gum” or natural condition. There are two distinct varieties of the textile—lst, soft, Canton, or Oriental crape, and 2d, hard or crisped crape. Tho wavy appearance of Canton crape results from the peculiar manner in which the weft is prepared, the yarn from two bobbins being twisted together in the reverse way. The fabric when woven is smooth and even, having no crepe appearance, but when the gum is subsequently extracted by boiling it at once becomes soft, and the weft, losing its twist, gives the fabric the waved structure which constitutes its distinguishing feature. Canton crapes are used, either white or coloured, for ladies’ scarves and shawls, bonnet trimmings, Ac. The Chinese and Japanese excel in tho manufacture of soft crapes. The crisp and elastic structure of hard crape is not produced either in the spinning or in the weaving, but is due to processes through which the gauze passes after it is woven. What the details of these processes are is known to only a few manufacturers, who so jealously guard their secret that, in some cases, tho different stages in the manufacture are conducted in towns far removed from each other. Commercially they are distinguished as single, double, three-ply, and four-ply crapes, according to the nature of the yarn used in their manufacture. They are almost exclusively dyed black and used in mourning dress, and among Roman Catholic communities for nuns’ veils, Ac. In Great Britain hard crapes are made nt Braintree in Essex, Norwich, Yarmouth, Manchester, and Glasgow. A very successful imitation of real crape is made in Manchester of cotton yarn, and sold under the name of Victoria crape.
