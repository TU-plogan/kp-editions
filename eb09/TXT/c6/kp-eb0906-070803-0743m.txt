CUPID (Amor, *Epωs), in classical mythology, was the god, first, of the principle of love as it was seen to exist throughout nature, and, secondly, of love as a human passion. In the former and earlier phase of his character, he resembled Hermes, and like him was probably a deity of the primitive Pelasgians, since the worship of him at Parion on the Hellespont was connected with the Pelasgic religion of Samothrace, one of the deities of which is named ’A£t-¢poç. The same primitive character appears at Thespiae, where the symbol of his worship was an unhewn stone (àpyòs λι‰ς). He was the oldest of the gods, being the son of Chaos, or of night and day, or of heaven and earth, with a variety of other poetic parentages. But as god of human love he was the son and constant companion of Aphrodite (Venus); yet even in this respect his earlier character is partly visible, since she was goddess of springtime, and brought him up in the fields till spring burst from the beautiful island of Cyprus, and spread fertility over the earth. In his ethical capacity he was regarded as the most recent of the gods, and was represented as a beautiful winged youth with bow and arrows or with a torch. The fact of his having wings would preclude him from being classed with the great deities. But as messenger of Venus he would have the same right to them that Iris derived from her office as messenger of the gods. At Thespiae gymnastic and musical contests (Erotidia) were held in his honour every four years; and generally in Greece his statue was to be found beside those of Hermes and Hercules in the palaestra. The statue of Cupid by Praxiteles at Thespiae was greatly celebrated. The Spartans and Cretans sacrificed to him before battle. In later works of arts Cupid assumed simultaneously a number of forms (*Epωτ∈ς), each identical with the other, as if to indicate his presence at many points at once. We have also Eros and Anteros, or love and its opposite. The story of Cupid and Psyche, as given by Apuleius and as illustrated in later art, is a figurative[9:6:709] explanation of the course of human love. The great beauty of Psyche, a king’s daughter, excites the jealousy of Venus, who sends Cupid to her to inspire her with love for some ordinary person. But he is caught by her charms and lives with her happily in a fairy palace, she being under a vow not to look on him with her mortal eyes. Taunted for this by her sisters she breaks the vow and Cupid vanishes. Venus now imposes on her many sore troubles. At last she must fetch a box for her from Hades, which curiosity makes her open on the way, and the scent escaping from it overpowers her. Cupid comes to her aid, implores J upiter in her behalf, and with his consent she is removed to Olympus, where she lives for ever with Cupid.
