CORVÜS, Μ. Valerius, one of the most illustrious generals of the early Roman republic, was born about 370 b.c. The legend which accounts for his cognomen of Corvus (the raven) tells how, while fighting with a gigantic Gaul, he was assisted by a raven, which baffled l∣is enemy by fluttering in his face. He was twice dictator and six times consul, and he occupied the curule chair twenty-one times. In his various campaigns he defeated successively the Gauls, the Volsci, the Samnites, the Etruscans, and the Marsi. His most important victory was that which he won over the Samnites at Mount Gaurus (343 B.c). He died a hundred years old about 270 B.c.
