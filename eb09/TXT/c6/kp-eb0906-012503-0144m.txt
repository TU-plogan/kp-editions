COLEBROOKE, Henry Thomas (1765-1837), an eminent Oriental scholar, the third son of Sir George, the [9:6:126] second baronet of that name, was born in London. He was educated at home; and when only fifteen he had made considerable attainments in classical and mathematical studies. From the age of twelve to sixteen he resided in France, and in 1782 was appointed to a writership in India. About a year after his arrival there he was placed in the Board of Accounts in Calcutta; and three years later he was removed to a situation in the revenue department at Tirhoot, where he pursued his studies in Eastern science and literature. In 1789 he was removed to Purneah, where he investigated the resources of that part of the country, and published his Remarks on the Husbandry and Commerce of Bengal, in which he advocated free trade between Great Britain and India. After eleven years’ residence in India, Colebrooke began the study of Sanskrit; and to him was confided the translation of the great digest of Hindu law, which had been left unfinished by Sir William Jones. After filling a number of important offices, and publishing some works on Oriental literature, including a Sanskrit grammar and dictionary, he returned to London, where he died, March 18, 1837. He was a director of the Asiatic Society, and many of the most valuable papers iu the Society’s Transactions were communicated by him.
