COLIMA, the capital of the state of Colima, Mexico, in I9° N. lat. and 103° 7' W. long. The town is situated in a fertile and well-watered plain. It has regular streets, mostly paved, a Government house, a college, several schools and churches, and two squares, and is a place of considerable trade in linens, woollens, cotton goods, and hardware. The population exceeds 31,000. Colima was founded by Gonzalo de Sandoval in 1522, received incorporation from Philip IL, and attained the rank of a city in 1824. Thirty miles to the N.E. is the volcano of Colima, the most westerly in Mexico, and 12,000 feet in height. For some days previous to the earthquake which visited the Pacific coast of Mexico on thfe 20th December 1868, the volcano emitted smoke and steam; and in 1869, after 40 years’ inactivity, there was another eruption. Manzanilla, the port of Colima, about 60 miles west of that town, has a good anchorage, and is sheltered from the south winds prevalent during the rainy season; but, on account of the proximity of a stagnant marsh, it is an unhealthy place; and it abounds, moreover, with mosquitoes and sandflies.
