COLONNA, Giovanni Paolo, chapel-master of St Petronio at Bologna, and president of the Philharmonic Academy there, was born at Brescia about the middle of the 17th century. The music-school which he established at Bologna produced many good musicians, among them Clari. Most of Colonna’s works are for the church, and are among the most remarkable compositions of the 17th century. They included settings of the psalms for three, four, five, and eight voices, and several masses and motetts. He also composed an opera, under the title Ámilcare, and an oratorio, La Profezia dfEliseo. Boyce considered Colonna as Handel’s model for choruses accompanied with instrumental parts different from the vocal. The same practice, however, was adopted by several of Colonna’s contemporaries.
