CORDOVA, a town of Mexico, with about 6500 inhabitants, in the province of Vera Cruz, and 57 miles inland from the city of that name. It is situated in a very fertile district near the volcano of Orizava. and trades in tobacco, coffee, sugar, and cotton. Its streets are well paved and regularly laid out; the most of its houses are built of stone, and the cathedral, which occupies one side of a large central square, is a fine edifice, with a highly ornamented interior. The neighbourhood abounds in antiquarian remains, and at Amatlan de los Reyes especially there are traces of a temple and a cave, with fragments of carving and pottery.
