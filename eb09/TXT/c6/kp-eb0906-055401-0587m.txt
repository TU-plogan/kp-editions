CRASSUS, MarcusLicinius, the triumvir, surnamed the Rich on account of his wealth, which he acquired by educating slaves and selling them at a high price, by working silver mines, and by skilful purchases of land and houses. The proscription of Cinna obliged him to flee to Spain; but after Chinaâ€™s death he passed into Africa, and thence to Italy, where he ingratiated himself with Sulla. Having been sent against Spartacus, he gained a decisive victory, in which 12,000 of the rebels were killed, and was honoured with an ovation at his return. Soon afterwards he was elected consul with Pompey, 72 b.c., and he displayed his opulence by entertaining the populace at 10,000 tables. He was afterwards censor, and he joined Pompey and Caesar in forming the first triumvirate. As his love of riches was greater than his love of glory, Crassus was satisfied with the province of Syria, which promised to be an inexhaustible source of wealth. Having crossed the Euphrates he hastened to make himself master of Parthia; but he was defeated and taken prisoner by Surena, the Parthian general, who put him to death by pouring molten gold down his throat. His head was then cut off and sent to Orodes. See Roman History.
