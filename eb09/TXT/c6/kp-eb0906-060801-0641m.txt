CRONSTADT, Kronstadt, or Krünen (Romanic, J3rasioυu, Magyar, Brasso), a town of Transylvania, Austria, situated on the slope of the Transylvanian Alps, near the south-eastern corner of the principality, at an elevation of 1830 feet above the sea. It is the capital of a district of the same name, also known as Burzenland, from the stream of the Burze, a tributary of the Alt, which waters it, a rich agricultural and pastoral country, though high-lying and with a cold climate, inhabited by an industrious population of Germans, Hungarians, Wallachs, Armenians, and Greeks. The town stands in a narrow valley, shut in by mountains, and consists of a well-built inner town dating from the 13th century and surrounded by walls, with suburbs named Altstadt, Blumenau, and Bulgarei. Cronstadt is the most populous centre of Transylvania; three-fifths of the people of the inner town are Germans; the suburbs are chiefly inhabited by Magyar Szeklers, and by Wallachs. Its principal buildings are the Gothic Protestant church, the finest in the principality, other Lutheran churches, a Gothic Catholic church, the Rathhaus with high tower, .and a market-house built in 1545. On a height over the town rises a strong old castle of the German knights. After Hermannstadt this is the most important manufacturing and trading town of Transylvania. Iron and copper working, paper manufacture, and printing (Cronstadt was the first place in Transylvania at which a printing press was established), w ax bleaching, turkey - red dyeing, wool spinning, linen weaving, leather and bottle making are its chief industries, and it possesses at least sixty large trading houses. Its communications are kept up by a railway uniting it with the Hungarian system, and by passes over the mountains into Wallachia. The nearest of these passes are those of Tömösch, nine miles south, with a summit elevation of 3645 feet, and that which leads through the village of Törzburg, 20 miles south-west of the town. Population of commune (1869), 27,766.
