CRÉBILLON, Prosper Jolyot de (1674-1762), a famous French tragic poet, was born at Dijon, where his father was notary-royal. Having been educated at the Jesuits’ school of the town, and at the College Mazarin, he became an advocate, and was placed in the office of a lawyer named Prieur at Paris. The encouragement of his master, an old friend of Scarron’s, induced him to continue with more serious intention his youthful habit of rhyming, and he soon produced a Mort des Enfants de Brutus, which, how*· ever, he failed to bring upon the stage. But in 1705 he succeeded with Idoménée, the representation of which gained him considerable fame; in 1707 his Atrée et Thyeste was repeatedly acted at court; and in 1711 he produced his finest play, the lìhadamiste et Zênobie, which is one of the masterpieces of the French classical tragedy. But his Xerxes (1714) was only once played, and his Sémiramis w as an absolute failure. Meanwhile, in 1707, Crébillon had married a girl without fortune, who had since died, leaving him an infant son. His father also had died, insolvent. His three years’ attendance at court had been fruitless. Envy had circulated innumerable slanders against him. Oppressed with melancholy, he removed to a garret, -where he surrounded himself with a number of dogs, cats, and ravens, which he had befriended; he became utterly careless of cleanliness or food, and solaced himself with constant smoking. But in 1731 he w as elected member of the French Academy, in 1735 he was appointed royal censor; andin 1745 Mme. de Pompadour, in her enmity to his rival Voltaire, presented him with a pension of 1000 francs and a post in the royal library. In 174t> his Catilina was played with great success before the court; and in 1754, eight years before his death, appeared his last tragedy, Le Triumvirat. Such was the rivalry of Voltaire, that to prove his own superiority he took the subjects of no less than five of Crébillon’s tragedies— Semiramis, Electre, Catilina, Le Triumvirat, Atrée— as subjects for tragedies of his own. For vigour and passion Crébillon is unsurpassed in the French classical drama; his faults are want of culture and the consequent absence of classical correctness, and a want of care which displays itself in his style and even in the mechanism of his verse.
