COTTON, Sir Robert Bruce (1570-1631), the founder of the Cottonian Library, born at Denton in Huntingdonshire in 1570, was a descendant, as he delighted to boast, of Robert Bruce. He was educated at Jesus College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. degree at the age of fifteen. His antiquarian tastes were early displayed in the collection of ancient records, charters, and other manuscripts, which had been dispersed from the monastic libraries in the reign of Henry VIII.; and throughout the whole of his life he was earnestly engaged in gathering materials for his library and museum of antiquities from all parts of England and the Continent. Perhaps his first pamphlet is that maintaining the right of the English ambassador to precedence over the envoy of Spain, which was written at the request of Elizabeth. On the accession of J ames I. he was knighted, and soon after he was employed in drawing up a Memorial on Abuses in the Navy, in consequence of which a navy commission was appointed, of which he was made a member. He also presented to the king an historical Inquiry into the Crown Revenues, in which he speaks freely about the expenses of the royal household, and asserts that tonnage and poundage are only to be levied in war time, and to “proceed out of good will, not of duty.” In this paper he proposed the creation of the order of baronets, each of whom was to pay the Crown £1000; and in 1611 he himself received the title. In 1615 Cotton, as the intimate of the earl of Somerset, whose innocence he always maintained, was placed in confinement on the charge of being implicated in the murder of Overbury; nor did he obtain his release till he had paid £500 for a pardon. Shortly before he had been examined before a royal commission, being suspected of having made known to Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, the intentions of the English court. The charge is supported by the despatches of Gondomar to Madrid, though probably Cotton deserves no serious blame. From Charles I. and Buckingham Cotton received no favour; he was the ι intimate friend of Sir John Eliot, Sir Symonds d’ Ewes, and John Selden. In 1626 he gave advice before the council against debasing the standard; and in January 1628 he was again before the council, urging in courtly language the summons of a Parliament. His arguments on the latter occasion are contained in his tract entitled The Danger in ιvhiclι the Kingdom now standeth and the Remedy. In October of the next year he was arrested, together with the earls of Bedford, Somerset, and Clare, for having circulated a tract known as the Proposition to bridle Parliament, which had been addressed some fifteen years before by Sir Robert Dudley to James I., advising him to govern by force; the circulation of this by Parliamentarians was regarded as intended to insinuate, that Charles’s government was arbitrary and unconstitutional. Cotton was himself released the next month; but the proceedings in the Star Chamber continued, and, to his intense vexation, his library was sealed up by the king. The pain caused by a base attempt to extort money by attacking his character further weakened his already failing health; and on the 6th of May 1631 he died. He was buried in Conington Church, where a monument is erected to his memory. His son, Sir Thomas, added considerably to the Cottonian library; and Sir John, the fourth baronet, presented it to the nation in 1700. In 1731 the collection, wdιich had in the interval been removed to the Strand, and thence to Ashburnham House, was seriously damaged by fire. In 1757 it was transferred to the British Museum.

See the article Libraries, and Edwards’s Lives of the Founders of the British Museum, vol. i. Several of Cotton’s papers have been printed under the title Cottoni Posthuma ; others have been published by Thomas Hearne.
