ALGAROTTI, Francesco, Count, was born at Venice on the 11th December 1712. He went abroad in his youth, and in 1733 visited Paris, where he issued his Newtonian Philosophy for the Ladies, in the work entitled The Plurality of Worlds. He was much honoured by Frederick the Great, who, when crowned at Königsberg in 1740, created him a count of Prussia. He died at Pisa on the 23d of May 1764, and, by his own direction, the following inscription was placed upon his tomb :— Hic jacet Algarottus, sed non omnis. He is allowed to have been a great connoisseur in painting, sculpture, and architecture; arid he contributed much to the reformation of the Italian opera. His works (6 vols., Leghorn, 1764; 17 vols., Venice, 1791-4) are numerous, and on a variety of subjects, abounding with vivacity, elegance, and wit.
