ALIMONY is, in English Law, the allowance for maintenance to which a wife is entitled out of her husband’s estate on a decree, obtained at the wife’s instance, for judicial separation or for the dissolution of the marriage. It is settled by the judge of the Divorce Court on a consideration of all the circumstances of the case.
