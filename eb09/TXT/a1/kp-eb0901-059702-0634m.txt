ALOIDAe, or Aloiadae, the designation of Otus and Ephialtes, sons of Poseidon by Iphimedea, wife of Aloeus. They are celebrated for their extraordinary stature, being 27 cubits in height and 9 in breadth when only nine years old. The story of their piling Pelion upon Ossa in their war with the Olympian gods is one of the best known of the early Greek myths. According to Homerâ€™s account, they were destroyed by Apollo ere their beards began to grow. (Odyssey, xi. 305; Iliad, v. 385.)
