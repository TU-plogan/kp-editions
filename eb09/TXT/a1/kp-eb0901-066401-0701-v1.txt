AMBROSE, Isaac, a Puritan divine. Formerly the practical and devotional writings of this eminent Nonconformist rivalled John Bunyan’s in popularity, and his Looking to Jesus holds its own even now. Prominent name as his was in his generation, very scanty are the personal memorials of him. His own “Media,” under the head of “Experiences,” yields a few incidents of his life. According to Anthony à Wood, he was a minister’s son, descending from those of the name living at Lowick, and they from the Ambroses of Ambrose Hall in Lancashire. It is probable that his father was Richard Ambrose, vicar of Ormskirk, who was succeeded by another son, Henry. It seems improbable that any of his line could descend of the Lowick Ambroses, inasmuch as they were the most “persistent Catholics of Lancashire;” and there is the additional consideration that, while in our worthy’s writings there are many references to the Papists, he makes not the slightest allusion to his conversion from Popery, or to any Catholic relatives or associations. He entered Brazenose college, Oxford, in 1621, in the seventeenth year of his age, and must therefore have been born in 1603-4. Having proceeded Μ.A. and been ordained, he received at the outset a little cure in Derbyshire, which was at that time and onward to Puritanism what Goshen was to Egypt and Israel. By the influence of the Earl of Bedford, he was appointed one of the king’s itinerant preachers in Lancashire. Having later served for a time a curacy in Garstang, he was selected by the Lady Margaret Hoghton as vicar of Preston. He was on the celebrated committee for the ejection of “scandalous and ignorant ministers and schoolmasters” during the Commonwealth. So long as Ambrose continued at Preston he was favoured with the warm friendship of the Hoghton family, as was John Howe, —their ancestral woods and the tower near to Blackburn affording him sequestered places for those devout meditations and “experiences” that give such a charm to his diary. The immense auditory of his sermon at the funeral of Lady Hoghton is a living tradition still all over the county. For some reason which is unknown, perhaps failing strength for so onerous a charge, Ambrose left his great church of Preston, and became minister of Garstang, where before he had been curate. He was vicar of Garstang when the Act of Uniformity was passed. He could have conscientiously complied with many of its requirements, for he was willing to use the Prayer-book, and did not stickle at things whereat other tender consciences did; but the enforcement was so absolute, not to say brutal, that he found himself constrained to form one of the Two Thousand. His after years were passed among old friends at Preston. He spent a great part of his time every summer in Widdicre wood, where, seldom seen by any except on the Sabbath, he communed with his own heart and his God. The last time he was seen alive was by some friends from Garstang, of whom he is said to have taken leave with unusual affection and gravity. Immediately after they left him he retired to his wonted place of meditation, where he was found by an attendant in articulis mortis. He died in 1664 at the age of sixty-one. Calamy says he was seventy-two, but his college entry shows he was mistaken. As a religious writer, Ambrose has a vividness and freshness of imagination possessed by scarcely any of the Puritan Nonconformists. He is plaintive as Flavel and as intense as Baxter. Many who have no love for Puritan doctrine, nor sympathy with Puritan experience, have appreciated the pathos and beauty of his writings, which have never been out of print from their original issue until now.
