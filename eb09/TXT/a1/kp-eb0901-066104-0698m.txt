AMBO, or Ambon (Gr. aμβωv, from άναβαίνω), a reading-desk or pulpit in early Christian churches which was placed in the middle of the nave. It was ascended by a flight of steps on both the east and west sides, and was in some cases so large as to accommodate fifty persons. From it the lessons were read, and hence it was sometimes called suggestus lectorum and βήμα των αναγνωστών. It was also occasionally used by the preacher. Two movable ambos may be seen in the church of St John Lateran at Rome. The purposes of the ambo were served in mediaeval churches by the rood-loft, a gallery across the chancel-arch, and in modern churches it has given place to the lectern and the pulpit.
