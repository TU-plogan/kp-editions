ALBORNOZ, Gil Alvarez Carillo de, a cardinal of Spain, was born at Cuença early in the 14th century, and was related to the royal families of Leon and Arragon. While still young he was appointed archbishop of Toledo by Alfonso XI. of Castile. Uniting, as many in that age did, the exercise of the military with that of the clerical profession, he was able to show his gratitude to his patron by saving the king’s life at the battle of Tarifa in 1340. He conducted the siege of Algeciras in 1343, when the king dubbed him a knight. Falling into disfavour with Pedro the Cruel, whose licentious life he had rebuked, he fled to Avignon, then the papal seat, and was soon afterwards made a cardinal by Pope Clement VI. In 1353 Innocent VI. sent him as a legate into Italy, with a view to the restoration of the papal authority in the States of the Church. He was recalled in 1357, but was sent again to Italy after a brief interval; and in 1362 had paved the way for the return of Urban V. to Rome. As a mark of gratitude, the pope appointed him legate at Bologna in 1367, but he died at Viterbo the same year. According to his own desire, his remains were carried to Toledo, where Henry of Castile caused them to be entombed with almost royal honours. A work by Albornoz on the constitution of the Church of Rome, first printed at Jesi in 1473, is now very rare. The college of St Clement at Bologna was founded by Albornoz.
