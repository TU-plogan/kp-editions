ALBACETE, one of the new provinces of Spain, was formed in 1833 out of districts taken from Murcia and New Castile. It is bounded on the N. by Cuen√ßa, on the E. by Valencia and Alicant, on the S. by Murcia, and on the W. by Ciudad Real and Jaen. The area is 5971 square miles. The province is generally hilly, some of the peaks of the sierras rising to a height of 5000 feet; but it contains rich plains and many fertile valleys. The principal rivers are the Mundo in the southern and the Jucar in the northern part of the province; and there are numerous smaller streams. Some parts of the country have a bare appearance, being destitute of wood, but the neighbourhood of Alcarez is covered with fruit trees, and presents the aspect of a garden. Agriculture is in a tolerably prosperous state, more advanced than in the centre of Castile, but less so than in the rich districts of Murcia and Valencia. Cereals, pulse, and fruits of all kinds are produced, as well as wine of fair quality, and excellent honey. Saffron also is produced in large quantities, and some attention is given to the keeping of silk-worms. Many of the inhabitants devote themselves to the rearing of cattle, sheep, and goats. The bulls of Albacete are in request for bull-fights; there is a good breed of mules, and the horses of the province have long mounted the Spanish cavalry. Manufactures are confined to the spinning of hemp, and the making of coarse cloths, porcelain, earthenware, and cutlery. There are several distilleries, and a considerable trade in wood. The district is rich in minerals, including silver, iron, copper, zinc, sulphur, gypsum, and coal; but, excepting stones and marble for building purposes, they are little wrought. In addition to agricultural produce, small quantities of zinc, iron, and sulphur are exported. There are numerous mineral springs, chiefly sulphureous, and hot as well as cold, at various places in the province. Among the chief towns are Albacete, Chinchilla, Bonillo, and Alcarez. The railway from Madrid to Valencia traverses the province, and at Chinchilla a line branches southward to Murcia.

The state of education throughout the province is very low. In the town of Albacete, where it is best, little more than half the population can read; while at Yeste, where it is worst, the proportion is only 1 in 15. The graver crimes are of infrequent occurrence; but the inhabitants always wear arms, and offences against the person are numerous. Population in 1867, 221,444.

Albacete, a town of Spain, capital of the above province, is situated about 140 miles S.E. of Madrid, and is a station on the railway between Madrid and Valencia. It is surrounded by a fertile plain, and has considerable trade in saffron and in the agricultural products of the district. A great market, chiefly for the sale of cattle, is held annually in September, and extends over several days. The town is well built, and has several churches, two hospitals, and a normal school. At one time it had an extensive trade in cutlery, from which it received the name of the Sheffield of Spain. This manufacture has been very much reduced by the importation of cutlery from England and Germany, but Albacete is still famous for its daggers, which are held in high repute and much worn by the Spaniards. They are formidable weapons, of coarse manufacture, but with richly-ornamented handles, and frequently bear proverbial inscriptions suitable to their murderous appearance. Population, 15,150.
