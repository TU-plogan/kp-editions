ALGARVE, the most southerly province of Portugal, is bounded on the E. by the Spanish province of Seville, from which it is separated by the river Guadiana; on the N. by Alemtejo; and on the W. and S. by the Atlantic Ocean. Its length from east to west is 85 miles, the average width is 22 miles, and the area, according to the most recent measurement, 1865 square miles. In 1868 the population was 177,342, giving the small proportion of 95 to the square mile.

The Sierra de Caldeiraon and the Sierra de Monchique extend across the northern part of the province, and, sweeping to the south-west, terminate in the lofty promontory of Cape St Vincent, the south-west extremity of Europe. Between the mountainous tracts in the north and the southern coast stretches a narrow plain, watered by numerous rivers flowing southward from the hills. In the hilly districts the roads are bad, the soil unsuited for cultivation, and the inhabitants few. Flocks of goats are reared on the mountain sides. The level country along the southern coast is more fertile, and produces in abun [9:1:510] dance grapes, figs, oranges, lemons, olives, almonds, and aloes, and even the plantain and the date. The land is, however, not well suited for the production of cereals; little wheat or other com is grown in the province, and its grain supplies are chiefly derived from Spain. On the coast the people derive their subsistence in great measure from the fisheries, tunny and sardines being caught in considerable quantities. Salt is also made from sea-water. There is no manufacturing or mining industry of any importance. The harbours are bad, and the whole foreign trade is carried on by ships of other nations, although the inhabitants of Algarve are reputed to be the best seamen and fishermen of Portugal. The chief exports are dried fruit, wine, salt, tunny, sardines, and anchovies.

The name of Algarve is derived from the Arabic, and signifies a land lying to the west. The province was taken from the Moors in 1253 by Alphonso III., king of Portugal, who then assumed the additional title of king of Algarve. It is sometimes designated the district of Faro, and is subdivided into fifteen communes and sixty-two parishes. The chief town is Faro, and among the other towns are Castro Marino, Tavira, Portimao, Lagos, and Sagres, all on the coast or on the estuaries of the rivers, and Silves, on the river Portimao, the ancient Moorish capital of Algarve.
