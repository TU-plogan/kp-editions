ALBERT, Cardinal Archbishop of Magdeburg and Elector of Mentz, born 1489, was the youngest son of John, Elector of Brandenburg. In 1513 he was consecrated archbishop of Magdeburg, and about the same time he was chosen administrator of the diocese of Halberstadt. Next year he was raised to the still higher dignity of archbishop and elector of Mentz, and he continued to hold all three offices simultaneously. For the pallium in connection with the latter appointment the pope demanded the exorbitant sum of 30,000 ducats, but enabled the archbishop to recoup himself by granting him the privilege of selling indulgences throughout his diocese. It was his employment of the Dominican Tetzel in this service which, by calling forth Lutherâ€™s famous ninety-five theses, had so important an influence on the course of the Reformation. In 1518 he was created a cardinal as a reward for his services to the Romish church. His opposition to the doctrines of Luther did not prevent many within his own diocese from accepting the Reformation; and he found it necessary to grant religious liberty to his subjects in 1541, availing himself of the opportunity to extort from them in return for the boon the payment of his debts, which amounted to 500,000 florins. Albert was a patron of learning, and counted Erasmus among his friends. He died at Mentz on the 24th September 1545.
