ALEMBIC (Arab. alanbiq, cognate to the Greek ἂ μβι ξ ), an apparatus for distillation, used chiefly by the alchemists, and now almost entirely superseded by the retort and the worm-still. It varied considerably in form and construction, but consisted essentially of three parts—a vessel containing the material to be distilled, and called, from its gourdlike shape, the cucurbit; a vessel to receive and condense the vapour, called the head or capital ; and a receiver for the spirit, connected by a pipe with the capital. The entire apparatus was sometimes constructed of glass, but as this rendered it very expensive and brittle, it was more usual to make the cucurbit of copper or earthenware, and the capital alone of glass.
