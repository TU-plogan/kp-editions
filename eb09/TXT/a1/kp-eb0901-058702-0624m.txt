ALLORI, Alessandro, a painter of the Florentine school, was born at Florence in 1535, and died in 1607. Having lost his father in his fifth year, he was brought up and trained in art by his uncle, Angelo Bronzino, whose name he sometimes assumed in his pictures. Visiting Rome in his nineteenth year, he carefully studied the works of Michael Angelo; but having himself little genius and no originality, the influence of that great master can inly be traced in the anatomical correctness of his draw- .ng of nude figures. He was very successful as a portraitpainter.
