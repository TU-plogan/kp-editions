ALBI, a city of France, capital of the department of the Tarn, is situated on the river Tam, 41 miles N.E. of Toulouse. It is a place of great antiquity, and was a stronghold of the early French Protestants, giving its name to the Albigenses. It is the seat of an archbishop, and has a chamber of commerce and a public library of 12,000 volumes. The cathedral, dedicated to St Cecilia, is a magnificent Gothic edifice, in the style of the 13th century, and has one of the finest choirs in France. Here there is a very valuable silver shrine, of exquisite mosaic work, containing the relics of St Clair, the first bishop of the see. The environs are charming, and the promenade of La Lice, without the city, is a beautiful terrace bordered with two rows of very fine trees. At one end is the convent of the Dominicans. Albi has woollen and linen manufactures; coal, iron, and copper are wrought in the vicinity; and the surrounding district is very fertile, producing much grain and fruit. Population (1872), 17,469.
