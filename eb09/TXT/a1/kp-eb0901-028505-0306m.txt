AGOSTINI, Leonardo, an eminent antiquary of the17th century, born at Siena. After being employed for some time by Cardinal Barberini to collect works of art for the Barberini palace, he was appointed by Pope Alexander VII. superintendent of antiquities in the Roman states. He issued a new edition of Parutaâ€™s Sicilian Medals, with engravings of 400 additional specimens; but a promised volume of letterpress explanation never appeared. In conjunction with Bellori he also published a work on antique sculptured gems, which was translated into Latin by Gronovius (Amsterdam, 1685).
