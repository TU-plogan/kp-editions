AGNAN0, Lago d', a small circular lake near Naples, about two miles in circumference, and evidently situated in the crater of an extinct volcano. On its banks are the stufe, or natural vapour-baths of San Germano, beneficial in cases of rheumatic disease; and on its opposite shore is the famous Grotta del Cane, from the floor of which carbonic acid is continually evolved, rising to a height of about 18 inches, in such quantity as to kill dogs that enter it, while a man, on account of his erect posture, wholly escapes the effects of the gas. (See Spallanzaniâ€™s Travels.) The grotto is a small artificial excavation, 12 feet long by 4 or 5 wide and 6 feet high, seemingly made for obtaining puzzolano, or earthy volcanic tufa.
