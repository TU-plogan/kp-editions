ALEXANDER, Archibald, D.D., a Presbyterian divine of America, was born of a family, originally Scotch, in Rockbridge county, Virginia, on the 17th April 1772 (died [9:1:493] 1851). After completing his preliminary education at Timber Ridge, he came under the influence of the religious movement known as the “great revival,” and devoted himself to the study of theology. Licensed to preach in 1791, he was engaged for seven years as an itinerant missionary in his native state, and acquired during this period the facility of extemporaneous speaking for which he was remarkable. For a time president of Hampden Sidney College, he resigned that position in 1807 to become pastor of Pine Street church, Philadelphia. In 1810 the degree of doctor of divinity was conferred upon him by the college of New Jersey, and in the following year he was appointed first professor in the newly-established Presbyterian theological seminary at Princeton. He filled the chair until his death in 1851. Dr Alexander wrote a considerable number of works in theology, which have had a large circulation. Among these may be mentioned his Outlines of the Evidences of Christianity (1823), which has passed through several editions, and been translated into various languages; and his Treatise on the Canon of the Old and New Testament (1826). He was also a frequent contributor to the Biblical Repertory, edited by Professor Hodge.
