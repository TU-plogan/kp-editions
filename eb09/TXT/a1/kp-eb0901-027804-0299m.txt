AGATHO, an Athenian tragic poet, the disciple of Prodicus and Socrates, celebrated by Plato in his Protagoras for his virtue and his beauty. A tragedy of his obtained the prize in the fourth year of the 90th Olympiad, and he was crowned, in the presence of upwards of 30,000 persons, when a little over thirty years of age. There are no remains of his works, except a few quotations in Aristotle, Athenaeus, and others.
