ALLEN, John (1770-1843), was bom near Edinburgh, and educated at the university of that city, where he took the degree of M.D. in 1791. With youthful enthusiasm, Allen joined the Scottish movement of that period for parliamentary reform. He was an acute metaphysician, and the prelections on physiology which he delivered in Edinburgh are distinguished by clearness and precise philosophical views. Leaving Edinburgh, he took up his abode at Holland House as the friend and private secretary of the late Lord Holland. In 1811 he was elected warden of Dulwich College; and in 1820 obtained the comfortable sinecure of master of that institution, where he died in 1843. Alien’s detached publications, though well written, are not very important, if we except his valuable Inquiry into the Growth of the Royal Prerogative (1830), “a learned and luminous work;" but he was an able contributor to the Edinburgh Review, to which he is said to have furnished no less than forty articles, chiefly on physiological, metaphysical, and political subjects; and some of his contributions on French and Spanish history are very interesting. For this last department he was peculiarly fitted by his residence with Lord Holland in France and Spain; he had even collected materials for a history of Spain, but was hindered from fulfilling his purpose by his deep interest in politics. The latter portion of his life was divided between politics and the study of the history of the British constitution. Brougham, in his éloge of Allen (Works, vol. iv., 1872), has highly commended him for extensive learning and philosophical talent.
