AMRU-IBN-EL-ASS, or c Λmr, one of the most famous of the first race of Saracen leaders, was descended of Aasi, of the tribe of Koreish. In his youth he wrote satirical verses against the person and doctrine of Mahomet. His zeal in opposing the new religion prompted him to undertake an embassy to the king of Ethiopia, in order to stimulate him against the converts whom he had taken under his protection, but he returned a convert to the Mahometan faith, and, along with Khaled, joined the fugitive prophet at Medina. When Abu-Bekr resolved to make a new attack upon Syria, he entrusted Amru with a high command. In this ho was so successful that he rose to the elevated station of chief in Irak, when Khaled requested the attendance of all the Arabian generals before Damascus. During the caliphate of Omar he also served in Palestine under Abu-Obeïdah, taking the command in the siege of Caesarea, which yielded to him in July G38 a.d. After the death of Obeïdah, Amru assumed the chief command in Syria, in which he was confirmed by the caliph, notwithstanding the opposition of Othman. Soon afterwards (639) he led an army of 4000 Arabs into Egypt. During the progress of his march a messenger from Omar arrived with a letter containing directions to return, if he should receive this letter in the territories of Syria; but if he should receive it in those of Egypt, he might advance, and all needful assistance would be instantly sent to him. The contents of the letter were not made known to his officers until he was assured that the army was on Egyptian soil, so that the expedition might be continued under the sanction of Omar’s orders. Having taken Pharma, he advanced to Misrah, the ancient Memphis, and besieged it for seven months. Although numerous reinforcements arrived, he would have found it very difficult to storm the place previous to the inundation of the Nile, but for a treacherous lessening of the forces of the citadel, which was consequently taken by storm; and the Greeks who remained there were either made prisoners or put to the sword. On the same spot Amru erected a city named Fostat, the ruins of which are known by the name of Old Cairo. Amru pursued the Greeks to Alexandria, and after an obstinate and bloody siege of fourteen months, the city was taken, 640 a.d. To Amru has generally been attributed the burning of the famous Alexandrian library, by command of the caliph Omar. But with this act of barbarism, so inconsistent with the character of Omar and his general, he is for the first time charged by Abul-Faragius, a Christian writer, who lived six centuries later. It is highly probable that few of the 700,000 volumes collected by the Ptolemies remained at the time of the Arab conquest, when we consider the various calamities of Alexandria from the time of Caesar to those of Caracalla and Diocletian, and the disgraceful pillage of the library in 389 a.d. under the rule of a Christian bishop, Theophilus (see Gibbon, c. 51). Amru died 663 a.d. In a pathetic oration to his children on his death-bed he bitterly lamented his youthfid offence in satirising the prophet, although Mahomet had forgiven him, and had frequently affirmed that “there was no Mussulman more sincere and steadfast in the faith than Amru.”
