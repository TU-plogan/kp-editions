+====================================================================+


ALI PASHA, surnamed Arslan or “The Lion,” was born at Tepelini, a village of Albania, on the Voyutza, at the foot of the Klissoura Mountains, in 1741. He belonged to the Toske tribe, and his ancestors had for some years held the title of Bey of Tepelini, this dignity having become hereditary in his family. His grandfather fell in 1716 at the siege of Corfu, which was then held by the Venetians. His father, who died when Ali was in his fourteenth year, is represented by most authorities as a man of amiable character and peaceful habits, who was despoiled of his territories by the chiefs that lived around him; but his mother was a woman of fierce and unyielding disposition. Inciting her son to recover the possessions of his father, she roused in him a spirit of cruelty and aggression, tempered, however, by a considerable amount of cunning and foresight, which bore bitter fruit in his riper years. Many romantic stories are told of Ali’s adventures at the outset of his career, but the only fact3 that are known with certainty are, that after living in the mountains as a robber for some years, and enduring great privations, he made himself master of his beylik of Tepelini by the aid of his associates. He is said to have then murdered his brother and imprisoned his mother, who died shortly after, on a charge of attempting to poison him. In order to increase and establish his power, he then made overtures to the Turkish government, by whose orders he attacked and defeated the pasha of Scutari, then in rebellion against the sultan, and put to death Selim, pasha of Delvino. For these acts he was rewarded by being placed in possession of the whole of his father’s territories, and he was appointed lieutenant to the Derwend-pacha of Rum-ili, an officer who was charged with the suppression of brigandage and highway robbery in the district. Ali, however, by permitting the robbers to go unchecked in return for a share of the spoil, brought his superior to disgrace and death, but escaped himself by sending bribes to the ministers of the sultan. For his services in the field in the war between Prussia and Turkey in 1787 he was appointed pasha of Trikala in Thessaly, and Derwend-pasha of Rum-ili. He soon cleared the country of robbers, mainly by summoning to his standard all who were willing to serve under him, and by their aid he took forcible possession of Joannina in 1788. By means of the powerful body of troops at his command, and the wise measures that he introduced, he wrought considerable amelioration in the districts under his charge, and the Porte seeing this, confirmed him in the pashalik of Joannina. His whole attention was now turned to the aggrandisement of his territory and personal power. He obtained possession of the western part of Northern Greece, or Livadia as it was then called; but was baffled for many years in his attempts to occupy the country of the Suliotes in the south-west of Epirus. These brave and hardy mountaineers at last, in 1803, agreed to evacuate their country, and were treacherously massacred by Ali while on their way to the coast to embark for Corfu. When the French took Venice in 1797, Ali, by pretending admiration for the principles of the revolution, induced Napoleon to send him engineers, by whose aid he fortified Joannina; but failing to obtain from him, as he had hoped, the Venetian ports on the seaboard of Epirus, he took occasion, after the defeat of Napoleon in Egypt, to lay siege to Prevesa, which was surrendered by the French troops. Ali had now a difficult part to play, but he succeeded so well with his master the sultan, that he was confirmed in the possession of the whole of Albania northwards from Epirus to Montenegro, over which he had asserted his authority, partly by intrigue and partly by force of arms. He also held the high position of governor of Rum-ili for a brief period (1799), during which he amassed a large sum of money by his extortions. The cruel massacre of the inhabitants of Gardiki, for an alleged insult to his mother and sister about forty years previously, was perpetrated about this time. He contrived to make his peace with the French in spite of the capture of Prevesa, and in 1807 once more entered into alliance with them, with the view of obtaining Parga, which he had attempted to capture, but without success, in 1800. Napoleon, however, neglected to secure Parga for him at the peace of Tilsit, and the fortress remained in the hands of the French until it was taken in 1814 by the English, who gave it up in 1817, ostensibly to the sultan, but in reality to Ali. Ali was now at the height of his power: he was almost supreme over Albania, Epirus, part of Thessaly, and the western part of Northern Greece; while one of his sons held the pashalik of the Morea. So powerful was he that, though he was nearly eighty years of age, the Porte feared and hated him, and desired his death, but could find no good pretext for taking measures against him until [9:1:574] 1820, when Ali procured the assassination of an officer who had left him and taken service under the sultan at Constantinople. For this daring act the sultan proscribed Ali, and ordered all the European pashas to march against him. He resisted every effort to capture him, but was at last induced by Kourschid Pasha to surrender in January 1822 on promise of a pardon from the sultan. On 5th February, on pretence of handing him the necessary document, Kourschid Pasha procured an interview with him, and then produced the firman authorising his execution. The brave old despot defended himself with his usual resolution and courage, but was overpowered by numbers, and his head was struck from his body and sent to Constantinople.
