AIR, or Asben, a country of central Africa, lying between 15° and 19° N. lat. and 6° and 10° E. long. The northern and best known portion of this region is of a very diversified character. It has numerous mountain ranges, some of which rise to a height of 5000 feet, with richly-wooded hollows and extensive plains interspersed. The mimosa, the dum-palm, and the date are abundant; and the valleys are covered with the exuberant vegetation of the tropics. Some of the plains afford good pasturage for camels, asses, goats, and cattle; others are desert tablelands. In the less frequented districts wild animals abound, notably the lion and the gazelle. The country generally is of sandstone or granite formation, with occasional trachyte and basaltic ranges. There are no permanent rivers; but during the rainy season, from August to October, very heavy floods convert the water-courses in the hollows of the mountains into broad and rapid streams. Numerous wells supply the wants of the people and their cattle. To the south of this variegated region lies a desert plateau, 2000 feet above the level of the sea, destitute of water, and tenanted only by the wild ox, the ostrich, and the giraffe. Still further south is the district of Damerghu, nominally tributary to Air, undulating and fertile, and yielding rich crops. Notwithstanding the fertility of the valleys in the northern portion of the country, there is little of the soil under cultivation except in the neighbourhood of the villages, where slaves are employed in tillage. Millet, dates, indigo, and senna are the principal productions. The great bulk of the food supplies is brought from Damerghu, and the whole materials for clothing are also imported. Were it not for the traffic in salt between Bilma and the Hansa states of Soudan, the country could scarcely maintain its present limited number of inhabitants. A great caravan annually passes through Air, consisting of several thousand camels, carrying salt from Bilma to Sokoto. Air was called Asben by the native tribes until they were conquered by the Berbers. The present inhabitants are for the most [9:1:430] part of a mixed race, combining the finer personal traits of the Berbers with the characteristics of the negro. The king or sultan of Air occupies a very precarious position, being to a great extent dependent on the chiefs of the Tawarek tribes inhabiting a vast tract of the Sahara to the north-west, who are continually at war among themselves. A large part of the revenue of the king is derived from tribute exacted from the salt caravan. His authority does not seem to be great in the outlying parts of his dominions. The chief town of Air is Agades (q.v .) (See Dr Barth’s Travels in Central Africa, vol. i.)
