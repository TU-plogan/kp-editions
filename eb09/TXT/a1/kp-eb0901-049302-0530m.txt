ALEXANDER, Sir William, earl of Stirling, poet. The family of Alexander of Menstrie— i.e., of the poet— is of ancient lineage, “tracing its descent from Somerled, lord of the Isles, in the reign of Malcolm IV., through a misty Highland genealogy, to John, lord of the Isles, who married the Princess Margaret, daughter of King Robert II. Their son, Alexander, was father of Angus, who founded the family of Macalister of Loup, and of Alexander, who obtained from the Argyle family a grant of the lands of Menstrie in Stirlingshire, and settled there— his descendants assuming his christian name of Alexander as their surname. The fifth in descent from this personage was Alexander Alexander, whose successor was his son, William Alexander, the poet” (Works: Introductory Memoir, vol. i. p. ix., 1870). From his (rare) engraved portrait, William was, it appears, aged 57 in 1637; so that he must have been born (at Menstrie House, where afterwards was born Sir Ralph Abercromby) in 1580. The grammar school of neighbouring Stirling probably furnished his early education; of his later, it is simply known that he attended the university of Glasgow. On leaving it he proceeded on his travels with Archibald, seventh earl of Argyle. It is supposed that it was during his sojourn on the Continent he composed his series of sonnets, afterwards published under the title of Avrora (1604). He was tutor to the young earl. Upon his return he proceeded to court, and won for himself speedily a name as a gentleman of parts and learning. The first of his Monarchicke Tragedies had been published at Edinburgh in 1603, viz., The Tragedie of Darivs, which, like his Parenesis to the Prince (1604), bore on the title-page simply, “By William Alexander of Menstrie.” In 1604 he reprinted Darivs along with a new tragedy of Coesar, giving the two the afterwards more celebrated title of Monarchicke Tragedies — ultimately increased by The Alexandraen and Julius Caesar (1607). In 1607 he describes himself as “William Alexander, gentleman of the prince’s privy chamber.” King James was much taken with him. He held his office with the prince of Wales until his lamented death in 1612, on which he published his Elegie on the Heath of Prince Henrie (Edinburgh, 1612). In 1612 he was made master of bequests, and knighted; his title-page of the Elegie bearing to be by “Sir William Alexander of Menstrie.” In 1614 appeared his Doomesday; or, the Great Hay of the Lord’s Ivdgement (Edinburgh). In 1621 (September 21) he received the most prodigious “gift” ever bestowed on a subject, viz., “a gift and grant” of Canada, inclusive of Nova Scotia, or Acadie, and Newfoundland—a fact declarative of royal ignorance of what the gift really was. Yet was it subsequently confirmed by Charles I. In 1624, Alexander, in relation to his grant, published An Encouragement to Colonies— twice at least reprinted (1625 and 1630). The gift and grant belong to history rather than biography, and their later results to the romance of the peerage and of law. In 1626 he was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland, and in 1630 created a peer, as Lord Alexander of Tullibody, and Viscount Stirling. In 1631 he was made an extraordinary judge in the Court of Session. In 1632 he built Argyle House, a quaint building, which remains one of the “lions” of Stirling. In 1633 he was advanced a step in the peerage, being created Earl of Stirling and Viscount Canada; and in 1639 Earl of Dovan. In 1637 he collected his poetical works, and issued them as Recreations with the Muses, “by William, Earle of Sterline,” with his portrait engraved by Marshall. This folio did not include either Avrora or the Psalms of King David (Oxford, 1631), although there seems little doubt that he, rather than King James, was the main author of the latter. It, however, first gave his second sacred poem (incomplete) of Jonathan. He died in London on 12th February 1640, and later his remains were transferred to Stirling. Lauded by Sir Robert Ayton and William Drummond of Haw-thornden, the Earl of Stirling, nevertheless, soon fell out of men’s memories. The recent careful and beautiful edition of his Poetical Works (3 vols.) ought to revive his fame; for while there is too often a wearying wordiness, the student-reader is rewarded with “full many a gem of purest ray serene.” His Doomesday has some grand things; his Avrora suggests comparison with Sidney’s Astrophel and Stella.
