ALCIPHRON, the most eminent of the Greek epistolary writers, was probably a contemporary of Lucian. His letters, of which 116 have been published, are written in the purest Attic dialect, and are considered models of style. The imaginary authors of them are country people, fisherwomen, courtesans, and parasites, who express their [9:1:469] sentiments and opinions on familiar subjects in refined and elegant language, yet without any very apparent inconsistency. The new Attic comedy being the principal source from which Alciphron derived his information, these letters are valuable as delineating the private life of the Athenians at that period. The best editions are by Bergler, Lips. 1715, and Wagner, Lips. 1798.
