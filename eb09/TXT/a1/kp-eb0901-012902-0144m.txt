ACTAeON, in Fabulous History, son of Aristaeus and Autonoë, a famous hunter. He was torn to pieces by his own dogs. Various accounts are given of this occurrence; but the best known story is that told by Ovid, who represents him as accidentally seeing Diana as she was bathing, when she changed him into a stag, and he was pursued and killed by his dogs.
