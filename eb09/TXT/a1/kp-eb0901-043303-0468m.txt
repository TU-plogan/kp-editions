AJMÍR, a district and town of British India, in Rájpu-táná. The district lies between 25° 43' and 26° 42' N. lat., and 74° 2 2' and 75° 33' E. long., measuring 80 miles in length from north to south, by 50 miles in breadth, and comprising an area of 2057 square miles. It is bounded on the E. by the states of Krishnagar and Jaipur, on the S. by Mewár, on the W. by the British district of Mairwárá, and on the N.W. by the state of Jodhpur. The population in 1865 was returned at 426,268; of whom 363,539, or 85 per cent., were Hindus, and the remainder chiefly Mahometans. The eastern portion of the district is generally flat, broken only by gentle undulations, but the north and north-western parts are intersected by the great Aravalli range (q.v.) Many of the valleys in this region are mere sandy deserts, with an occasional oasis of cultivation, but there are also some very fertile tracts; among these is the plain on which lies the town of Ajmír. This valley, however, is not only fortunate in possessing a noble artificial lake, but is protected by the massive walls of the Nág-páthar range or Serpent rock, which forms a barrier against the sand. The only hills in the district are the Aravalli range and its offshoots. Ajmír is almost totally devoid of rivers, the Bands being the only stream which can be dignified with that name, and it only touches the south-eastern boundary of the district so as to irrigate the Parganá of Samur. Four small streams—the Ságar-matí, Saraswatí, Kharí, and Daí—also intersect the district. In the dry weather they are little more than brooks. The Ságar-matí and Saraswatí unite at Gobindgarh, the united waters flowing on under the name of the Luní (or salt water) river. There are two first-class roads in Ajmír, viz., one from Ajmír city to Gangwana, and thence through the Krishnagarh and Jaipur states to Agra; and another from the city to the cantonment station of Nasírábád, a distance of 14 miles. There is also a second-class road from Ajmír to Nayá Nagar, a distance of 36 miles, besides sixteen third-class tracks connecting the principal towns and villages with the city. The principal products of the district are wheat, barley, rice, sugar-cane, peas, bajrá, maize, til (oil-seed), tobacco, and cotton. With the exception of woollen blankets, turbans, &c., manufactures can be scarcely said to exist in Ajmír. Salt is made in a rude method at Rámsur, from the saline exudations of the soil, to the extent of 3000 cwt. per annum. After supplying local wants, the surplus is exported towards Málwa and Ságar. The principal trade is in wool, cotton, opium, printed cloths, and tobacco. A large quantity of cotton is exported to Nayá Nagar, in Mairwárá district, whence it finds its way into the Bombay market. Oil is also a profitable article of trade. The domestic animals are sheep, horses, bullocks, camels, and goats. Cattle, and especially bullocks, are much valued, but are very scarce, owing partly to the want of sufficient pasturage and partly to frequent droughts. When these occur, the cattle are sent away to the neighbouring states, where better pasture can be procured, and very few find their way back. The imperial revenue obtained from the district in 1867 amounted to £61,791, 8s., exclusive of local funds raised by a road, tank, and postal cess.

The tenures of the agricultural village communities in Ajmír are of a very simple and uniform kind. They all belong to the type known as “imperfect patídárí,” by which the better descriptions of land are held in severalty by each member of the proprietary body. Each member is responsible for the amount of revenue allotted on his holding; but in event of the default of any shareholder, the whole community is collectively liable for the total sum. The inferior and waste lands remain the property of the whole village, and the income derived from them is credited to the common account. The cultivators are nearly all proprietors of the land they till. A large portion of Ajmír district is parcelled out into estates, varying in size from a single village to a large parganá (or fiscal division). These estates are held by Rajput chiefs, some of whom descend from the original ruling families, while others owe their position to force or to the favour of the reigning power. They have all been confirmed in their estates by the British on payment of a fixed annual quit rent. Three towns are returned as containing a population of upwards of 5000 inhabitants in 1867—viz., Ajmír city (the capital and the only municipality in the district), population 34,763; Kekrí, 6357; and Pisangun, 5055. There is also a military cantonment at Nasirábád, the garrison of which in 1867 consisted of a battery of European artillery, a European infantry regiment, a squadron of native cavalry, and a regiment of native infantry. In 1867 there were eighteen government schools in the district, attended by 647 pupils, and a government college at Ajmír city attended by 320 students. Besides these there were three mission schools for boys and one for girls in Ajmír city, and eight others in its neighbourhood. The average attendance at the mission schools amounted to 347.

Ajmír City, the capital of Ajmír district, is situated in a picturesque and fertile valley surrounded by mountains, in 26° 29' N. lat. and 74° 43' E. long. The town is partly built on the lower slope of the Tárágarh hill, and is surrounded by a stone wall with five handsome gates. To the north of the city is a large artificial lake called the Anaságar, whence the water supply of the place is derived The town is clean, and possesses several handsome streets, the dwellings of the better classes being large and well built. The population in 1867 numbered 34,763, about [9:1:434] two-thirds being Hindus, and the remainder Mahometans. The city trade chiefly consists of salt and opium. The former is imported in large quantities from the Sambar lake and Rámsur. Oilmaking is also a profitable branch of trade. Cotton cloths are manufactured to some extent, for the dyeing of which the city has attained a high reputation. A municipal income of about £2000 a-year is derived from octroi duties levied on articles consumed in the town. Out of this the police and conservancy arrangements are paid, the balance being spent on roads and in the support of charitable institutions. The Ajmír college, affiliated to the Calcutta university, had 320 pupils in 1867. The college buildings being inadequate to this number of pupils, the foundation-stone of a new structure was laid on the 17th February 1868. The agent to the governor-general for Rájputáná resides at Ajmír, which is also the headquarters of the commissioner of the Ajmír and Mairwárá division. It is likewise a station of a Scotch Presbyterian mission.

The chief object of interest is the darg á , or tomb of a famous Mahometan saint named Mayud-ud-dín. It is situated at the foot of the Tárágarh mountain, and consists of a block of white marble buildings, without much pretension to architectural beauty. To this place the emperor Akbar, with his empress, performed a pilgrimage on foot from Agra, in accordance with the terms of a vow he had made when praying for a son. The large pillars erected at intervals of two miles the whole way, to mark the daily halting-place of the imperial pilgrim, are still extant. An ancient Jain temple, now converted into a Mahometan mosque, is situated on the lower slope of the Tárágarh hill. With the exception of that part used as a mosque, nearly the whole of the ancient temple has fallen into ruins, but the relics are not excelled in beauty of architecture and sculpture by any remains of Hindu art. Forty columns support the roof, but no two are alike, and great fertility of invention is manifested in the execution of the ornaments. The summit of Tárágarh mountain, overhanging Ajmír, is crowned by a fort, the lofty thick battlements of which run along its brow and enclose the table-land. The walls are 2 miles in circumference, and the fort can only be approached by steep and very roughly-paved planes, commanded by the fort and the outworks, and by the hill to the west. On coming into the hands of the English, the fort was dismantled by order of Lord William Bentinck, and is now converted into a sanitarium for the troops at Nasírábád. Ajmír was founded about the year 145 A.D. by Aji, a Chohan, who established the dynasty which continued to rule the country (with many vicissitudes of fortune) while the repeated waves of Mahometan invasion swept over India, until it eventually became an appanage of the crown of Dehli in 1193. Its internal government, however, was handed over to its ancient rulers upon the payment of a heavy tribute to the conquerors. It then remained feudatory to Dehli till 1365, when it was captured by the ruler of Mewár. In 1509 the place became a source of contention between the chiefs of Mewár and Márwár, and was ultimately conquered in 1532 by the latter prince, who in his turn in 1559 had to give way before the emperor Akbar. It continued in the hands of the Mughuls, with occasional revolts, till 1770, when it was ceded to the Marhattás, from which time up to 1818 the unhappy district was the scene of a continual struggle, being seized at different times by the Mewár and Márwár rájás, from whom it was as often retaken by the Marhattás. In 1818 the latter ceded it to the British in return for a payment of 50,000 rupees. Since then the country has enjoyed unbroken peace and a stable government.
