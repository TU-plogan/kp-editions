AGAPETUS, deacon of the St Sophia Church at Constantinople, presented to the Emperor Justinian a work entitled Charta Regia, composed in 527, which contained advice on the duties of a Christian prince. It is highly valued, and has been several times reprinted. The best edition is that contained in Bandauriâ€™s Imperium Orientale (Paris, 1711). There is an English translation by Thomas Paynell (1550); and a French translation, executed from a Latin version by Louis XIII., with the assistance of his tutor, David Rivault.
