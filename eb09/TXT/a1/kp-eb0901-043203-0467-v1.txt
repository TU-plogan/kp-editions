AJAX (Aἴας), the son of Telamon. In Greek legend Ajax represents throughout only physical qualities, like Hercules, with whom, indeed, a likeness must have been recognised, or there would have been no sufficient basis for the belief that the child Ajax was bom at the prayer of Hercules in behalf of his friend Telamon (the. name Aἴας —or Aἴ-ας with digamma—being an allusion to the eagle, αἴετoς, which appeared to announce the success of the prayer); and again, that Hercules was present at the birth of the infant, and by wrapping it in his lion’s skin made it invulnerable, except in the armpit. In respect of being open to a wound in only one small spot Ajax resembles Achilles, with whom in the usual genealogy he claims to be related as cousin. But of this relationship there is no evidence in the Iliad, where Ajax appears of colossal frame (πελώριος), in himself a tower of strength (πν ρ γος ' Αχαιών), and, as the simile implies, prepared for defence, not to lead assaults, unmoved by the shafts of enemies as is an ass in a corn-field by the pelting of boys (Iliad, xi. 556-566), while Achilles is no less clearly drawn as sensitive to finer passions and tastes, if equally bold in war. Unwarranted as it was by the Iliad, the identification of Ajax with the family of Aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, and that not until Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion Solon inserted a line in the Iliad (ii. 557) for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island. Ajax then became an Attic hero, his name being given to one of the tribes. In this way his deeds came to be a favourite subject of the Attic drama, though they are not always represented in a creditable manner—as, for example, when, contrary to his steady character in the Iliad of being respectful to the gods, he is charged with insult to Athena, to account for her having influenced the decision against him in his competition with Ulysses for the armour of Achilles. It was Athena, also, who made him insane then, and led him to take his own life. From his blood [9:1:433] sprang a flower, as at the death of Hyacinthus, which bore the initial letter of his name. In later times the people of Novum Ilium believed him to have been wronged by the decision, and told how, when Ulysses had been shipwrecked, the armour of Achilles was wafted by the tide upon the shore near the tomb of Ajax.
