ALICANTE, a province of Spain, bounded on the N. by Valencia, on the W. by Albacete and Murcia, on the S. by Murcia, and on the S.E. and E. by the Mediterranean Sea. It was formed in 1834 of districts taken from the ancient provinces of Valencia and Murcia, the former contributing by far the larger portion. Its length is about 73 miles, its breadth 68 miles, and the area 2090 square miles. The surface of the province is extremely diversified. In the north and west there are extensive mountain ranges of calcareous formation, intersected by deep ravines; while farther south the land is more level, and there are many fertile valleys. On the Mediterranean coast, salt marshes, exhaling an insalubrious miasma, alternate with rich plains and pleasant and productive huertas or gardens, such as those of Alicante and Denia. There is no considerable river in the province, but a few rivulets flow east through the valleys into the Mediterranean. The sky is clear, the climate temperate, and the rainfall very slight. Notwithstanding the want of rivers and of rain, agriculture is in a very flourishing condition. The inhabitants possess a spirit of steady industry uncommon in Spain, and by means of wells and canals they have to a large extent succeeded in overcoming the disadvantages of nature. Many tracts originally rocky and sterile have been levelled, and now present terraces covered with the vine and with useful trees. Cereals are grown, but the inhabitants prefer to raise such articles of produce as are in demand for export, and consequently part of the grain supply of the province has to be imported. Esparto grass, rice, the sugar-cane, and tropical fruits and vegetables are largely produced. Great attention is given to the rearing of bees and silk-worms; and the wine of the province is held in high repute throughout Spain, while some inferior kinds are sent to France to be mixed with claret. Cattle are not extensively reared. The most important minerals of the province are lead, copper, iron, and coal. There are about twenty lead and copper mines; and mineral springs are found at various places. The manufactures consist of fine cloths, silk, cotton, woollen and linen fabrics, girdles and lace, paper, hats, leather, earthenware, and soap. There are numerous oil-mills and brandy distilleries. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in the carrying trade, while the fisheries on the coast are also actively prosecuted, tunny and anchovies being caught in great numbers. Barilla is obtained from the sea-weed on the shores, and some of the saline marshes yield large supplies of salt by spontaneous evaporation. The province is divided into 16 judicial divisions and 206 parishes. Alicante is the chief town, and the other places of importance are Denia and Villajoyosa on the coast; and Orihuela, Elche, Villena, and Alcoy in the interior. Education is in a low state; of the criminals arrested it is found that 14 in 15 can neither read nor write. The people are of a lively and irascible temperament, and offences against the person are frequent. Population (1870), estimated at 440,000.

Alicante, the capital of the above province, and, after Cadiz and Barcelona, the most considerable seaport of Spain. It is situated at the head of the bay of Alicante, in the Mediterranean Sea, in 38° 20' N. lat., and 0° 30' W. long. The city is built on the bay in the form of a half-moon, and is overlooked by a rock 400 feet high, surmounted by a castle, which has been suffered to fall into decay. There is good anchoring-ground in the bay, but only the smaller vessels can come up to the mole or pier. The bay is protected by batteries, and there is a fixed light on the mole, 95 feet high, and visible for a distance of 15 miles. Alicante was the Lucentum of the Romans; but notwithstanding its antiquity, the town presents a modern appearance, and has few remains of Roman, mediaeval, or Moorish times. It is the seat of a bishop, and has a cathedral and episcopal palace. It has also a good town-house, an orphanage, a lyceum, a public library, and a school of navigation. Cotton, linen, and woollen goods, cigars, and confections are manufactured. There is a considerable trade in the fruit and other produce of the surrounding plain; and the vino tinto, or dark red wine, produced in the vicinity, is sent to France for mixing purposes. At the island of Plana, on the coast, very beautiful marble is procured. The foreign trade of the port, though still considerable, has greatly declined on account of the imposition of an excessive import tariff. In 1871, besides coasting traders, 372 Spanish and foreign vessels, with a tonnage of 62,546, entered the port. Of these vessels, 78 were British, measuring 29,021 tons. The value of the imports under foreign and native flags was £542,526, and the duties paid were £90,421, without reckoning duties corresponding to material and fuel for railways, which are admitted free. The chief imports are coals, iron, machinery, and guano; and the chief exports esparto—of which 11,000 tons were shipped in 1871— raisins, almonds, oranges, olive oil, silk, saffron, wine, lead, salt, and soda. There are here English and other European consuls. Alicante was besieged by the Moors in 1331, and again by the French in 1709, when the English commandant and his staff were killed by the explosion of a mine. Population, 31,500.
