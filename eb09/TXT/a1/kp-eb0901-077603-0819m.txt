AMPLITUDE, in Astronomy, is the amount of deviation towards the north or south of a celestial object from the true east at rising, and the true wèst at setting. For the fixed stars it is constant; for the sun and planets it varies with the declination. At the equinoxes the sun rises exactly in the east, and sets in the west point,—the amplitude then is zero; at the solstices it amounts at London to 39° 44'.
