AINSWORTH, Robert (1660-1743), author of a well-known Latin dictionary, was born at Woodvale, near Manchester. After teaching for some time in Bolton, he removed to London, where he conducted a boarding-school, first at Bethnal Green, and then at Hackney. At a comparatively early period of his life he had realised a competency, and was able to retire. Proposals for the preparation of a Latin dictionary were made to him in 1714, but the work was not published till 1736. It was long extensively used in schools, and often reprinted, the later editions being revised and enlarged by other hands. Ainsworthâ€™s Dictionary was, however, radically imperfect, containing a mere register of words, with no scientific classification or complete and exact definition of their various meanings, and necessarily wanting the results of modem philological research. Later works have now entirely superseded it.
