ACCOLADE (from collum, the neck), a ceremony anciently used in conferring knighthood; but whether it was an embrace (according to the use of the modern French word, accolade), or a slight blow on the neck or cheek, is not agreed. Both these customs appear to be of great antiquity. Gregory of Tours writes that the early kings of France, in conferring the gilt shoulder-belt, kissed the knights on the left cheek; and William the Conqueror is said to have made use of the blow in conferring the honour of knighthood on his son Henry. At first it was given with the naked fist, a veritable box on the ear, but for this was substituted a gentle stroke on the shoulder with the flat of the sword. A custom of a similar kind is still followed in bestowing the honour of knighthood.
