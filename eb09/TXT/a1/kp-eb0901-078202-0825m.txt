AMURATH IV. was born about 1611, and succeeded his uncle Mustapha in 1623. The chief event of his reign was the recovery in 1638, after thirty days of unremitting assault, of the city of Baghdad which had fallen into the hands of the Persians. He disgraced his victory by revolting cruelties, slaughtering 30,000 Persians in cold blood. So numerous and horrible are the atrocities recorded of him, that he stands pre-eminent even among Turkish Neroes. Some historians ascribe this feature of his character to his almost perpetual inebriation. Be this as it may, he soon enfeebled his constitution, and falling at the same time under a superstitious anticipation of death, he died in 1640, at the early age of twenty-nine.
