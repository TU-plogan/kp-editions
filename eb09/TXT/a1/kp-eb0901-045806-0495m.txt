ALCANTARA, the ancient Norba Coesarea, a town of Spain, in the province of Caceres, on a rocky height on the left bank of the Tagus. Alcantara (in Arabic, the bridge) derived its name from the magnificent Roman bridge which spanned the Tagus at this point, and which was erected, according to the inscription, a.d. 104, in honour of the emperor Trajan, who was a native of Spain. This remarkable structure is built entirely of blocks of granite without cement, and consisted, until its partial destruction, of six arches of various span, with a total length of 670 feet and a height of 210 feet. The second arch on the right bank was blown up by the English in 1809, and, although temporarily reconstructed, was again destroyed in 1836 to prevent the passage of the Carlist troops. The bridge has never since been repaired; and it is a striking illustration of the want of public spirit in Spain that the river is crossed by means of a ferry-boat in the neighbourhood of this grand engineering work, which it is a national duty to preserve. The population of the town is 4200.
