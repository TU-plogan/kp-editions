ALTO-RILIEVO(high relief) is the term applied to sculpture that projects from the plane to which it is attached to the extent of more than one-half the outline of the principal figures. It is thus distinguished from basso-rilievo, in which there is a greater or less approximation to the pictorial method, the figures being made to appear as projecting more than half their outline without actually doing so. See Relief and Sculpture.
