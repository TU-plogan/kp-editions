ALGIERS (Fr. Alger, Arab. Al-Jezair, i.e., The Islands), a city and seaport of Northern Africa, and capital of Algeria, is situated on the west side of a bay of the same name in the Mediterranean. Lat. (of lighthouse), 36° 47' 20" N., long. 3° 4' 32" E. It is built, in the form of an amphitheatre, on the northern slope of a steep hill rising abruptly from the coast. It ascends the side of the hill in the form of an irregular triangle, the apex of which is occupied by the Casbah, or ancient fortress of the deys, which is about 500 feet above the level of the sea. As seen from a distance, the city presents a very imposing and picturesque appearance; and the houses rising one above the other, and being all built of white stone, it has been compared to a ship under sail. It consists of two towns—the new, which is entirely European in its character, and is built on the lower part of the slope and along the shore; and the old town, which occupies the higher region, and is entirely Oriental in its character. The new town consists of handsome streets and squares, and contains the government houses, hotels, warehouses, barracks, &c. In the centre of the new town is the Place du Gouvernement, a large and handsome square in the European style, with a fountain, and planted with orange and lime trees. The streets are regular, spacious, and handsome, and adorned with arcades. In the Arab or old town the streets are narrow, winding, and dirty. The houses are square substantial-looking buildings, presenting to the street bare walls, with only a few slits protected by iron gratings in place of windows. Each house has a quadrangle in the centre, into which it looks, and which is entered by a low narrow doorway. Algiers is surrounded by walls and otherwise fortified, but its landward defences are weak and exposed, while the batteries which defend it towards the sea are very strong. It has two handsome suburbs, and numerous elegant villas are scattered over the vicinity. The town is the residence of the governor-general of Algeria, of the prefect of the department of Algiers, and of the chiefs of the different administrative services. It is also the seat of a bishop and of the supreme courts of justice, and has a chamber and tribunal of commerce, a royal college, various schools, a bank, public library, and museum. Among the principal buildings are a cathedral and several Roman Catholic churches, a Protestant church, several synagogues, and a number of mosques. The town is well supplied with water, and there are numerous public and private fountains and baths. Various markets are held here, and horse-racing is a favourite amusement. Algiers has of late come to be noted as a winter residence for invalids. The French have spent large sums of money in the improvement of the port of Algiers. It has an area of 220 acres, and it is calculated that when a rock near the centre, called Poche Sans Nom, is removed, it will be capable of accommodating 40 vessels of war and 300 trading vessels. It has two docks, capable of containing the largest vessels. The lighthouse has a revolving light visible at the distance of 15 miles. Population (1866), 52,614.
