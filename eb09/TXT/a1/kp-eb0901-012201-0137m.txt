ACT, in Law, is an instrument in writing for declaring or justifying the truth of anything; in which sense records, decrees, sentences, reports, certificates, &c., are called acts. The origin of the legal use of the word Act is in the acta of the Roman magistrates or people, of their courts of law, or of the senate, meaning (1) what was done before the magistrates, the people, or the senate; (2) the records of such public proceedings.
