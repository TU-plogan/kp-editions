ALLESTRY, or Allestree, Richard, D.D., was born at Uppingtown in Shropshire in 1619, and educated in the grammar school of Coventry, and afterwards at Christ Church, Oxford. After passing as bachelor of arts he was made successively moderator in philosophy, canon of Christ Church, doctor of divinity, chaplain in ordinary to the king, and regius professor of divinity. His early studies, however, were interrupted by the hostilities of the times. In the year 1641 he and many other students of Oxford entered the royal service, and gave signal proofs of their courage and loyalty. A short interval of hostilities permitted Allestry to return to his literary pursuits; but soon after, he again took up arms, and was present at the battle of Keintonfield. On his way to Oxford to prepare for the reception of the king he was taken prisoner, but was released by the king’s forces. A violent disease which then prevailed in the garrison of Oxford brought Allestry to the brink of the grave; but recovering, he again joined a regiment of volunteers, chiefly consisting of Oxford students. Here he served as a common soldier, and was often seen with the musket in one hand and a book in the other. At the close of the revolutionary struggle he returned to his favourite studies, but still continued true to his party. This occasioned his expulsion from the college; but he was provided with a comfortable retreat in the families of the Honourable Francis Newport and Sir Anthony Cope. Such was the confidence reposed in him that when the friends of Charles II. were secretly preparing the way for his restoration, they entrusted him with personal messages to the king. In returning from one of these interviews he was seized at Dover, and upon examination committed a prisoner to Lambeth House. The Earl of Shaftesbury obtained his release in a few weeks. His valuable library was bequeathed to the university. He died in January 1681. He erected at his own private expense the west side of the outward court of Eton College, and the grammar school in Christ Church College; besides settling several liberal pensions upon individual persons and families. His only extant work is a volume of sermons, printed at Oxford in 1684.
