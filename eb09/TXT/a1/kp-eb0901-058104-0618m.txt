ALLEINE, Joseph, Nonconformist divine, the author of An Alarm to the Unconverted —a book which remains as potential as when first modestly sent forth, scarcely second to Richard Baxter’s Call to the Unconverted —was otherwise noticeable. Baxter himself wrote a characteristic introduction to his Life fully two centuries ago (1672); while recently (1861) the Rev. Charles Stanford has retold his story and the story of his age with great fulness of knowledge and historical fidelity. The Alleines came out of Suffolk, and as early as 1430 some of them—sprang of Alan, lord of Buckenhall—settled in the neighbourhood of Caine and Devizes, whence descended the immediate ancestors of “worthy Mr Tobie Alleine of Devizes,” father of our worthy. Joseph Alleine, fourth of a large family, was born at Devizes early in 1634. 1645 is marked in the title-page of a quaint old tractate, by an eye-witness, as his “setting forth in the Christian race." His eldest brother Edward had been a clergyman, but in this year died, in his twentyseventh[9:1:582] year; and Joseph entreated his father that he might be educated to succeed his brother in the work of the ministry. His father consented, and he was immediately sent to Poulshot, then under a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford (William Spinage). In April 1649 he set out for Lincoln College, Oxford, in the presidency of Dr Paul Hood, with Dr John Owen as the vice-chancellor of the university. A Wiltshire place becoming vacant in Corpus Christi College, on the 3d Nov. 1651 he was chosen scholar of that house. Of his student life it was written contemporaneously, “He could toil terribly.” On 6th July 1653 he took the degree of B.D., and thereupon became a tutor of his college. He became also chaplain of Corpus Christi, preferring this to a fellowship. In 1654 he had offers of high preferment in the state, which he declined. The succeeding year (1655) brought him another offer, which he did not decline. George Newton, of the great church of St Mary Magdalene, Taunton, sought him for assistant; and putting from him all other things, even forsaking further academical honours within his immediate grasp, he accepted the invitation by proceeding at once to Taunton, undergoing the accustomed probation, and at last being ordained as the associate of one of the most venerable of the later Puritan fathers. The ministry that resulted stands out lustrous and noble in the history of historical Taunton, and in the Life of the junior pastor, as told by Baxter and Stanford. Almost coincident with ordination came the marriage of the associate - pastor with Theodosia Alleine, daughter of Richard Alleine. Friendships among “gentle and simple” —of the former, with Lady Farewell, grand-daughter of Protector Somerset—bear witness to the attraction of Alleine’s private life. His public life—in preaching after the intense, awakening, wistful type; in catechising with all diligence and fidelity; in visitation among the poor and mean and sad; in letter-writing, tender and sympathetic; in devotional intercession through long consecrated hours of day and night—was a model of pastoral devotion. This is all the more remarkable as the pastor continued the student-toil of Corpus Christi, one monument of which was his Theologia Philosophica, a lost MS., establishing the harmony between revelation and nature, and whose learning—classical, patristic, and recondite—drew forth the wonder of Baxter. Alleine was no mere scholar or divine, but a man who associated on equal terms with the patriarchs of the Royal Society, then laying those broad and deep foundations on which rests England’s present scientific renown. These scientific studies and experiments, nevertheless, were ever kept in subordination to his proper work. The extent of his influence was, in so young a man, unique, resting fundamentally on the earnestness of his nature and the manifest power of his ministry. The year 1662 found senior and junior pastors like-minded, and both were of the Two Thousand. Alleine, when the Ejection blow fell, with John Wesley (grandfather of the celebrated John Wesley) for fellowlabourer, also ejected, carried on a kind of itineracy where-ever opportunity was found for preaching the gospel. For this he was cast into prison, indicted at sessions, and suffered as hundreds of England’s noblest men have suffered. His Letters from Prison were an earlier Cardi-phonia. He was released on 26th May 1664; and spite of the Conventicle Act (Five Mile Act), he returned to his beloved work as a preacher of the gospel. He found himself again in prison, and again and again a sufferer. Tempestuous and troubled were his remaining years. Now in hiding, now in great bodily weakness, now coming to the front in some act of charity or patriotism, now at the waters of Bath, slowly but serenely wearing out. He died November 17, 1668; and the mourners, remember ing their beloved minister’s words while yet with them, “If I should die fifty miles away, let me be buried at Taunton,” found a grave for him in St Mary’s chancel. Pilgrims from over the sea read with dim eyes the brief Latin inscription on his stone. No Puritan-Nonconformist name is so affectionately cherished as is that of Joseph Alleine. “Being dead he yet speaketh” through his imperishable practical books.
