AMARA SINHA, a Sanscrit grammarian and poet, of whose personal history hardly anything is known. He is said to have been “one of the nine gems that adorned the throne of Vikramaditya,” and accordingly to have flourished about 56 B.c. This seems on the whole the most probable date, though the fifth century of the Christian era, [9:1:653] and even the eleventh, have also been assigned, on the supposition that the Vikramaditya spoken of was not the first but a later monarch of the name. Amara seems to have been a Buddhist; and an early tradition asserts that his works, with one exception, were destroyed during the persecution carried on by the orthodox Brahmins in the fifth century. The exception is the celebrated Amara-Kosha (Treasury of Amara), a vocabulary of Sanscrit roots, in three books, and hence sometimes called Trikanda, or the “Tripartite.” It contains 10,000 words, and is arranged, like other works of its class, in metre, to aid the memory. The first chapter of the Kosha was printed at Rome in Tamil character, in 1798. An edition of the entire work, with English notes and an index by Colebrooke, appeared at Serampore in 1808. The Sanscrit text was printed at Calcutta in 1831. A French translation by Loiseleur-Deslongchamps was published at Paris in 1839.
