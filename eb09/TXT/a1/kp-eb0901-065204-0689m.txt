AMALRIC or Amauri of Bena, so called from his birthplace, a small village in the diocese of Chartres, was the founder of a school of pantheists known by his name. He lectured at Paris about the year 1200, and attracted a large circle of hearers. In 1204 his doctrines were condemned by the university; and on a personal appeal to Pope Innocent III. the sentence was ratified, Amalric being ordered to return to Paris and recant his errors. This he did in 1207. His death, two years later, was caused, it is said, by grief at the humiliation to which he had been subjected. In the same year (1209) ten of his followers were burnt before the gates of Paris, and Amalricâ€™s own body was exhumed and burnt, and the ashes given to the winds. The doctrines of the Amal-ricians were formally condemned by the fourth Lateran Council in 1215.
