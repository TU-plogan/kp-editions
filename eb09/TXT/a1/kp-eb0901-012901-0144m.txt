ACTA SENATUS, among the Romans, were minutes of the discussions and decisions of the senate. These were also called Commentarii Senatus, and, by a Greek name, υπομνήματα. Before the consulship of Julius Caesar, minutes of the proceedings of the senate were written and occasionally published, but unofficially. Caesar first ordered the minutes to be recorded and published authoritatively. The keeping of them was continued by Augustus, but the publication was forbidden. Some prominent senator was usually chosen to draw up these Acta.
