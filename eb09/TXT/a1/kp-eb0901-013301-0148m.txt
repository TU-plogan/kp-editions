ACTIUM, in Ancient Geography, a promontory in the north of Acarnania, at the mouth of the Sinus Ambracius, opposite the town of Nicopolis, built by Augustus on the north side of the strait. Eastwards from the promontory the strait widens out and forms a safe harbour. On the promontory was an ancient temple of Apollo (who is hence called by Virgil Actius), which was enlarged by Augustus. Actium became famous on account of Augustusâ€™s victory over Antony and Cleopatra (b.c. 31), and for the quinquennial games he instituted there, called Actia or Ludi Actiaci. Actiaca Aera was a computation of time from the battle of Actium. There was on the promontory a small town, or rather village, also called Actium.
