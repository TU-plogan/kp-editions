ALGER of Liège, known also as Alger of Clugny and Algerus Magister, a learned French priest who lived in the first half of the 12th century. He was first a deacon of the church of St Bartholomew at Liége, his native town, was afterwards translated to the cathedral church of St Lambert, and finally retired to the monastery of Clugny, where he died not later than 1145, though the precise date is uncertain. His History of the Church of Liége, and many of his other works are lost. The most important of his still extant works are:—1. De Misericordia et Justitia, a collection of extracts from Fathers, with reflections, which is to be found in the Anecdota of Martène, vol. v. 2. De Sacramento Corporis et Sanguinis Domini; a treatise, in three books, against the Berengarian heresy, highly commended by Peter of Clugny and Erasmus.

3. De Libero Arbitrio; given in Pez’s Anecdota, vol. iv.

5. De Sacrificio Missoe; given in the Collectio Scriptor. Vet. of Angelo Mai, vol. ix.
