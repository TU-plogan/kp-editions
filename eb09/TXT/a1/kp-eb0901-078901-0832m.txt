ANADYR, the name of a gulf and of a river in the north-east of Siberia. The gulf extends from Cape Tchutotskoi, on the north, to Cape St Thadeus, on the south, forming part of the Behring Sea; while the river, taking its rise from a lake in the Stanovoi mountains, called Ivashki or Ivachno, about 67° N. lat., and 173° E. long., flows through the Tchutchee country, at first to the west and then to the east, entering the gulf of Anadyrsk-aia, a branch of the gulf of Anadyr, after a course of about 600 miles. Anadyrsk is the only town on its banks, and the country through which it passes is thinly populated, barren, and desolate. For nine months of the year the ground is covered with snow, and there is not sufficient pasturage for cattle. Reindeer, upon which the inhabitants feed, are found in considerable numbers.
