ALREDUS, Alured, or Aluredus, of Beverley, one of the earliest English historians, was born at Beverley, in Yorkshire. He wrote in the reign of Henry L, but little is known with certainty of his life. It is generally believed that he was educated at Cambridge, and afterwards became one of the canons and treasurer of the church of St John’s at Beverley. We learn from a note in Bishop Tanner’s Bibliotheca Brit.-Hib. that, for the sake of improvement, he travelled through France and Italy, and at Rome became domestic chaplain to Cardinal Othoboni. He died in the year 1128 or 1129. His chief work, entitled Annales sive Historia de gestis R egum Britannicae, was edited by Thomas Hearne from a manuscript belonging to Thomas Rawlinson, and was published at Oxford in 1716. It contains an outline of the history of England from Brutus to Henry I., written in elegant Latin, and with remarkable accuracy as to facts and dates, though, of course, much of the earlier portion is fabulous. A manuscript entitled Libertates Ecclesioe S. Johannis de Beverloe, in the Cottonian library, is also ascribed to him, but on doubtful authority. It is a collection of records relative to the church of Beverley, translated from the Saxon.
