ALENIO, Giulio, a missionary of the Jesuit order, born at Brescia in 1582, died 1649. He became a member of the order in 1600, and arrived at Macao as a propagandist in 1610. For upwards of thirty years he laboured to spread Christianity in China, adopting, in accordance with the principles of his order, the dress and manners of the country. He was the first who planted the faith in the province of Kiang-Si, and he built several churches in the province of Fo-Kien. He composed a number of works in the Chinese language, of which he was thoroughly master, the most important being a Life of Christ and a Cosmography.
