ALLAN, David, a Scottish historical painter of considerable celebrity, was born at Alloa on the 13th February 1744. At a very early age he gave such proofs of natural artistic talent as led to his being placed under the care of the Messrs Foulis, who some time before had instituted an academy in Glasgow for painting and engraving. On leaving the academy (1762), after seven years’ successful study, he obtained the patronage of Lord Cathcart and of Erskine of Mar, on whose estate he had been born. The latter furnished him with the means of proceeding to Rome (1764), where he remained for a number of years engaged principally in copying the old masters. Among the original works which he then painted was the “Origin of Portraiture ”—representing a Corinthian maid drawing her lover’s shadow—well known through Cunego’s excellent engraving. This gained for him the gold medal given by the Academy of St Luke in the year 1773 for the best specimen of historical composition. Returning from Rome in 1777, he resided for a time in London, and occupied himself in portrait-painting. In 1780 he removed to Edinburgh, where, on the death of Alexander Runciman in 1786, he was appointed director and master of the Academy of Arts. There he painted and etched in aquatint a variety of works, those by which he is best known—as the Scotch Wedding, the Highland Dance, the Repentance Stool, and his Illustrations of the Gentle Shepherd —being remarkable for their comic humour. He has had frequently applied to him the name of the “Scottish Hogarth;” but his drolleries are not to be compared for a moment with the productions of the great English satirist. Allan died at Edinburgh on the 6th August 1796.
