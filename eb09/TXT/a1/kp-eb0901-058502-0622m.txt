ALLIER, a department in the centre of France, so called from the river of the same name; bounded on the N. by the department of Cher and Nièvre, on the E. by those of Saône-et-Loire and Loire, on the S. by that of Puys de Dôme, and on the W. by those of Creuse and Cher; extending at the widest points 82 miles from E. to W., and 55 from N. to S.; and containing an area of 2821 square miles. Its surface is in general undulating, rising to considerable elevations among the mountains of Forez on the south-east, and among those of Auvergne towards the west. The river Allier flows northward between these ranges, receiving the Andelot, the Sioule, and the Bioudre, all from the left; east of the Allier is the Bèbre, which joins the Loire within the limits of the department; and on the west the Cher, with its tributary the Aumance. The soil is for the most part fertile, especially in the valleys of the Allier, the Sioule, and the Bèbre, yielding wheat, oats, barley, rye, fruits, and potatoes, in quantities exceeding what is required for home consumption, as well as some red and white wines. Good timber is grown, and cattle, sheep, goats, and horses are reared in large numbers; but agriculture is on the whole in a backward condition, owing to the inhabitants’ aversion to change. The mineral wealth of the department is very considerable, including iron, coal, antimony, marble, and manganese—the coal mines of Commentry being among the most important. The chief manufactures are of cutlery, earthenware, glass, cloth, leather, and paper. The climate is healthy, but is liable to sudden variations of temperature. The mineral waters at Vichy, Nèris, and Bourbon l’Archambault, in the department, are in much repute. Allier comprehends the greater portion of the old province of Bourbonnais, and is at present divided into four arrondissements—Moulins, Gannat, La Palisse, and Montluçon, which are subdivided into 28 cantons and 317 communes. Moulins is the capital, and the seat of a bishop whose diocese is co-extensive with the department. The other important towns are La Palisse, Cusset, Vichy, Gannat, Saint Pourçain, Montluçon, and Commentry. Population in 1871, 390,812; of whom 196,831 were males, and 193,981 females. Of the total population, 223,374 could neither read nor write, and 36,786 could read but could not write.

Allier, the ancient Elaver , a river of France, which rises in the department of Lozère, among the Margeride mountains, a few miles east of the town of Mende, and, after traversing Haute Loire, Puys de Dôme, and Allier, forms the boundary between Cher and Nièvre, until it falls into the Loire four miles west of Nevers. Its length is 200 miles, for a considerable portion of which it is navigable, and its chief tributaries are the Dore and the Sioule.
