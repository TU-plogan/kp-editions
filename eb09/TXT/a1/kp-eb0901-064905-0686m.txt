ALYPIUS of Antioch, a geographer of the 4th century, who was sent by the Emperor Julian into Britain as prefect, and was afterwards commissioned to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem. Among the letters of Julian are two (29 and 30) addressed to Alypius; one inviting him to Rome, the other thanking him for a geographical treatise, which no longer exists.
