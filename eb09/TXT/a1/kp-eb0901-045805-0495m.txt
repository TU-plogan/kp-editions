ALCAMO, a city of Sicily, in the Italian province of Trapani, is situated 22 miles E. of Trapani, near the Gulf of Castellamare. It lies in a district of peculiar fertility, which produces some of the best wines in the island. The town is pleasantly situated on elevated ground, but its internal appearance is mean and dirty. It contains a very strong castle, and many churches and monasteries. Near it are the ruins of the ancient Segesta, including a Doric temple and a theatre in good preservation; and there are also on the neighbouring hill Moorish towers and other remains, standing as memorials of the Saracen occupation of Sicily. Population (1865), 19,518.
