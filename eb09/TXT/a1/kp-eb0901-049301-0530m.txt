He was transferred in 1852 to the chair of biblical and ecclesiastical history, which he occupied till his death in January 1860. Dr Alexander wrote several valuable works in his own department, the most important being a Translation of and Commentary on the Psalms, a Critical Commentary on the Prophecies of Isaiah, and a treatise on primitive church government.
