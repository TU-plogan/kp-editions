ADEL or Somauli, an extensive tract of country, stretching eastward from the neighbourhood of Tajurrah to Cape Guardafui, between 43° and 51° E. long., with a breadth not accurately ascertained. Zeila and Berbera are the chief ports on the coast, and have some trade with the opposite shores of Arabia, exporting spices, ivory, gold dust, cattle, and horses, and receiving Indian commodities in exchange. The country, which is marshy and unhealthy, is inhabited by the Somauli, who are governed by an Iman, and are Mahometans.
