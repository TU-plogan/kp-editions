AFRANIUS, Lucius, a Latin poet who lived about a century before Christ. He wrote comedies in imitation of Menander, and was commended by Cicero and Quintilian for his acute genius and fluent style. The fragments of his works which are extant have been collected by Bothe in his Poetae Scenici Latini, and by Neukirch in his De Fabula Togata Romanorum.
