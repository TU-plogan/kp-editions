ALBRECHTSBERGER, Johann Georg, a celebrated musician, born at Kloster-Neuburg, near Vienna, on the 3d February 1736. He studied musical composition under the court organist, Mann, and became one of the most learned and skilful contrapuntists of his age. After being employed as organist at Raab and Maria-Taferl, he was [9:1:456] appointed in 1772 organist to the court of Vienna, and in 1792 kapellmeister of St Stephenâ€™s cathedral. His fame as a theorist attracted to him in the Austrian capital a large number of pupils, some of whom afterwards became eminent musicians. Among these were Beethoven, Hummel, Moscheles, Seyfried, and Weigl. Albrechtsberger died in 1809. His published compositions consist of preludes, fugues, and sonatas for the piano and organ, string quartettes, &c.; but the greater proportion of his works, vocal and instrumental, exist only in manuscript, and are in the possession of Prince Esterhazy. Probably the most valuable service he rendered to music was in his theoretical works, which to a great extent superseded earlier treatises, and are still standard authorities. In 1790 he published at Leipsic a treatise on composition, of which a third edition appeared in 1821. A collection of his writings on harmony, in three volumes, was published under the care of his pupil Seyfried in 1826. The English translation of the latter is from a French version, and not from the original.
