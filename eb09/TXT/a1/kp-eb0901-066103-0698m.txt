AMBLETEUSE, a seaport town of France, in the department of the Pas de Calais, on the English Channel, 6 miles north of Boulogne. From the accumulation of sand in its harbour it has lost its importance as a seaport, and the town is now almost deserted. It possesses an historical interest as the landing-place of James II. after his abdication in 1688; and Napoleon I. in 1804 attempted to improve the harbour for the flat-bottomed boats by means of which he was to invade England. Near Amble-teuse is the column which he erected to the grand army in 1805. Population, about 700.
