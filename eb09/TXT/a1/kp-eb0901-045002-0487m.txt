ALBERT (Albrecht) I., Duke of Austria, aud afterwards King of Germany, born in 1248, was the son of Rudolph of Habsburg, the founder of the imperial Austrian dynasty. Rudolph having acquired the duchy of Austria by conquest, vested it in his son, with consent of the electors, in 1282, and thus founded the dynasty which still reigns. He also endeavoured to secure for Albert the succession to the throne of Germany, but was unsuccessful. On the death of his father in 1291, Albert seized the insignia of sovereignty, and with characteristic presumption declared himself king of Germany, without regard to the decision of the electors. Their choice fell (1292) upon Adolphus of Nassau, and Albert, who was called to suppress a revolt among his subjects in Switzerland, found it necessary to acknowledge the superior claims of his rival. The government of Adolphus having become displeasing to the electors, they formally deposed him in 1298, and named Albert his successor. As, however, the former refused to recognise their verdict, the matter had to be referred to the arbitrament of the sword. The forces of the rival kings met at Gölheim, near Worms, where the army of Adolphus was defeated, and he himself slain by Albert’s own hand. Upon this, Albert, wishing probably to show his moderation, resigned his claim to the throne; but he was re-elected, and crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle on the 24th August 1298. Pope Boniface VIIL, however, denied the right of the electors, and refused to confirm their choice, alleging that the empire belonged to him alone to hold or bestow at his pleasure. In league with Philip the Fair of France, Albert at first openly resisted the pope; but soon finding it advisable to change his policy, he deserted his ally, admitted the papal jurisdiction, and was rewarded with the kingdom of the deposed Philip. It should be noted, however, that he never received from the pope the crown of the Roman empire, though his name is generally included in the list of emperors. His reign as king of Germany was one of continual warfare. With a rapacity which seems to have known no bounds, he endeavoured to subdue Holland, Zealand, Friesland, Hungary, and Bohemia; but was in each case unsuccessful. The attempt to bind his yoke more firmly upon the Swiss cantons caused the revolt of Unterwalden, Schwyz, and Uri, in January 1308, and thus laid the foundation of the Swiss Confederation. It was while endeavouring to check this revolt that Albert met his death at the hand of his nephew, John of Habsburg, whose claim to his father’s dominion of Swabia had been refused in the most insulting terms by the king. Incensed at the denial of his rights, John formed a conspiracy with three noblemen of the king’s suite. On the 1st May 1308 the four crossed the river Reuss at Windisch with Albert, who was slain immediately on landing, and before the eyes of the other members of the suite, who had been left on the opposite side. He died in the arms of a beggar woman, who happened to be passing.

Albert was married to Elizabeth, daughter of the count of Tyrol, who bore him eleven children.

Four other reigning dukes of Austria bore the name of Albert. Of these, Albert II., surnamed the Wise, reigned from 1330 to 1358; Albert HI. from 1365 to 1390; and Albert IV., surnamed the Pious, from 1390 to 1402. Albert V., surnamed “The Magnanimous,” born in 1397, was elected king of Germany in April 1438, and is therefore sometimes styled Albert II., the higher dignity having been previously borne only by the first of the name. Through his marriage in 1422 with Elizabeth, daughter of Sigismund, king of Bohemia and Hungary, he ultimately added the sovereignty of these dominions to his own, being elected king of Hungary on the death of Sigismund in 1437, and king of Bohemia in May 1438. He died at Langendorf on the 27th October 1439, while engaged in an expedition against the Turks.
