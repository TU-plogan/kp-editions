ACROCERAUNIA, in Ancient Geography, a promontory in the N.W. of Epirus, which terminates the Montes Ceraunii, a range that runs S.E. from the promontory along the coast for a number of miles, and is supposed to have derived its name from being often struck with lightning. The cape (now called Glossa by the Greeks, and Lin-guetta by the Italians) is in lat. 40Â° 25' N.
