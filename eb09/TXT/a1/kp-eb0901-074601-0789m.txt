AMNESTY(αμνηστία, oblivion), an act of grace by which the supreme power in a state restores those who may have been guilty of any offence against it to the position of innocent persons. It includes more than pardon, inasmuch as it obliterates all legal remembrance of the offence. It is chiefly exercised towards associations of political criminals, and is sometimes granted absolutely, though more frequently there are certain specified exceptions. Thus in the case of the earliest recorded amnesty, that of Thrasybulus at Athens, the thirty tyrants and a few others were expressly excluded from its operation; and the amnesty proclaimed on the restoration of Charles II. did not extend to those who had taken part in the execution of his father. Other celebrated amnesties are that proclaimed by Napoleon on 13th March 1815, from which thirteen eminent persons, including Talleyrand, were excepted; the Prussian amnesty of 10th August 1840; and the general amnesty proclaimed by the Emperor Francis Joseph of Austria in ’1857. The last Act of amnesty passed in Great Britain is 20 Geo. II., c. 52, which proclaimed a pardon to those who had taken part in the second Jacobite rebellion.
