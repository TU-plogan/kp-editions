ADJUTANT, a military officer whose duty it is to assist the commanding officer of a regiment or battalion. Every battalion of infantry, regiment of cavalry, and brigade of artillery, has an adjutant, who keeps the regimental books, records, and correspondence; acts as the commanding officerâ€™s representative in matters of regimental detail; superintends the drill of recruits; keeps the roster (i.e., register of order of service) for all duties; details the guards, piquets, detachments, &c., that are furnished by the regiment; and is responsible for the receipt of the daily divisional or brigade order from the superior staff-officer, and the preparation and issue of regimental orders. The Adjutant-General is the staff-officer specially charged with all matters relating to the discipline and drill of the army.
