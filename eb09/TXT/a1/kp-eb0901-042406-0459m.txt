AIDAN, St, first bishop of Lindisfarne or Holy Island, embraced a religious life in the monastery of Iona. Oswald, king of Northumbria, having requested a mission of monks from Iona to labour for the conversion of his subjects, Aidan was chosen by the abbot as leader of the expedition, and was consecrated a bishop about 634-5 a.d. Bede speaks of the holiness of his life, of the influence of his preaching as seen in the conversion of multitudes, and also [9:1:425] of numerous miracles which he performed. Aidan died on the 31st August 651.
