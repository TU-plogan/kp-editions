ALMAGEST, compounded of the Arabic al and μεγίστη, the name applied by the Arabians to their translation of the Meγαλη Σύταξις of Claudius Ptolemy, which contains a large collection of problems in geometry and astronomy. The translation was made about the year 827 a.d. by order of the caliph Al-Mamun. The name is also applied to other editions and translations of the work, as well as to other scientific compilations. Thus Riccioli published a book of astronomy, the New Almagest, and Plukenet an Almagestum Botanicum.
