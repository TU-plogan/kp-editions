ALBERT NYANZA, a large lake in East Central Africa, extending from 2° 45' N. lat. at least as far as 2° S. Its surface is 2720 feet above the level of the sea: on its western coast are the Blue Mountains, rising 7000 feet higher; and on the east a ridge of steep cliffs, with elevations varying from 1500 to 5000 feet. The White Nile, flowing in a north-westerly direction from Lake Victoria Nyanza, enters Lake Albert Nyanza about 2° 15' N. lat., and issues from it near its northern extremity. Messrs Speke and Grant were informed of the existence of this lake by the natives, but Sir Samuel (then Mr) Baker and his wife were the first Europeans who explored it in 1864. (See Africa and Nile, and also Sir S. W. Baker’s The Albert Nyanza, the Great Basin of the Nile, and Explorations of the Nile Sources, 2 vols., London, 1866).
