ALVAREZ, Francisco, born at Coimbra after 1460, a [9:1:649] priest and almoner to Dorn Manuel, king of Portugal, was sent in 1515 as secretary to Duarte Galvão, on an embassy to David, king of Abyssinia. The expedition having been delayed by the way, it was not until 1520 that he reached Abyssinia, where he remained six years, returning to Lisbon in 1527. In 1533 he was sent to Rome on an embassy to Pope Clement VII. The precise date of his death, like that of his birth, is unknown; but it must have been later than 1540, in which year he published at Lisbon, under the king’s patronage, an account of his travels, in one volume folio, entitled Verdadeira Informaçam, do Preste Joas das Indias. This curious work was translated in Latin, under the title of De Fide, Regione, et Moribus Aethiopum, by Damien Goez, a Portuguese gentleman; and has often been reprinted and translated into other languages. The information it contains must, however, be received with caution, as the author is prone to exaggerate, and does not confine himself to what came within his own observation.
