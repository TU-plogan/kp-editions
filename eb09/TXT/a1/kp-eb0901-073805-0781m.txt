AMIOT, Pere Joseph, a learned Jesuit missionary to China, was born at Toulon in 1718. In 1750 he arrived, along with two others of his order, at Macao, from which, on a favourable answer to a petition being received from the emperor Kien-Lung, he removed to Peking in the autumn of the following year. He continued to reside in the capital until his death in 1794, devoting himself almost exclusively to the study of Chinese and Manchoo-Tatar literature. The results of his labours were communicated at frequent intervals to Europe in works which did more than had ever been done before to make known to the Western world the thought and life of the farthest East. Many of his statements, however, are not trustworthy, and his works are practically superseded by those of others who entered the field later. His Dictionnaire Tatarmantchou-Français (Paris, 1789) was a work of great value, the language having been previously quite unknown in Europe. His other writings are to be found chiefly in the Mémoires concernant Γ Histoire, les Sciences, et les Arts de Chinois (15 vols. 4to, Paris, 1776-91). The Vie de Confucius, which occupies the twelfth volume of that collection, is very complete and accurate.
