ALHAMA, a city of Spain, in the province of Granada, 24 miles S.W. of Granada. It is very picturesquely situated on the edge of a gorge in the hills of the Sierra de Alhama, the streets rising in terraces one above another. The river Marchan flows through the chasm, and the mountains behind the town reach a height of 8000 feet. The name Alhama signifies in Arabic “the bath,” and is derived from the hot mineral springs in the neighbourhood. These springs, which have a temperature of 118° Fahr., are considered beneficial in cases of dyspepsia and rheumatism, and in former times had as many as 14,000 visitors annually. Alhama was a most important fortress while the Moors ruled in Granada, and its capture by the Marquis of Cadiz in 1482 was the most decisive step in the reduction of their power. Remains of the Moorish castle and walls are still to be seen, as well as an aqueduct of Roman or Moorish origin. Many of the houses are of Moorish architecture, and the antiquities of the town, the mineral springs, and the wild scenery of the environs attract numerous visitors. Population, about 7000.
