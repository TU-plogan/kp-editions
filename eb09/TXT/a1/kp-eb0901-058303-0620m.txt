ALLENTOWN, formerly called Northampton, a thriving town of the United States, capital of Lehigh county. Pennsylvania, is pleasantly situated on a height on the western bank of the Lehigh River, 85 miles E.N.E. of Harrisburg. It is a well-built place, and contains a good court-house, a military institute, an academy, and a theological seminary. Most of the inhabitants are of German descent; the German language is commonly spoken, and is used along with English both in the newspapers and in' the courts of law. The valley of the Lehigh is very rich in iron ore and anthracite, and in the town and neighbourhood extensive iron-works and anthracite furnaces are in operation. This trade is being rapidly developed, and is favoured by good railway communication, New York and Philadelphia being both within 100 miles of Allentown by rail. A tenth of the whole iron manufactured in the United States is said to be produced here. Population (1870), 13,884.
