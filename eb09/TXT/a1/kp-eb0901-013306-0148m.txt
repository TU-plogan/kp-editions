ACUPRESSURE, in Surgery (acus, a needle, premo, I press), a method of restraining haemorrhage, introduced in 1869 by the late Sir J. Y. Simpson. The closure of the vessel near the bleeding point is attained by the direct pressure of a metallic needle, either alone or assisted by a loop of wire. The advantages claimed by the originator of this method over the old silk ligature were, that the needles can be removed within forty-eight hours after introduction, allowing the wound to heal rapidly; and that, being metallic and non-porous, they do not cause irritation and suppuration like the silk ligature. The catgut ligature, which is rapidly absorbed, is gradually superseding both the silk ligature and the acupressure needle. A volume entitled Acupressure, by Sir J. Y. Simpson, was published in 1864.
