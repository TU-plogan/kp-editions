ALCOY, one of the most thriving manufacturing cities of Spain, on the river A1coy, in the province of Alicante, 24 miles N.N.W. of the town of that name. It is built on an elevated site at the foot of a gorge of the Sierra de Mariola, and presents a picturesque appearance. There are several handsome buildings and a number of public fountains, but the industry of the place is its chief characteristic. The principal employment is papermaking. About 200,000 reams are produced annually, the extraordinary quantity of 180,000 reams being a paper of light texture used for making cigarettes. Coarse woollen stuffs are also manufactured. A very curious festival is held annually in April in honour of St George, the patron saint of the town. Population, 27,000.
