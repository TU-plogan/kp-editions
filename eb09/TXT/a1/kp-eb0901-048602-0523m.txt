ALEXANDER of Hales (Alexander Halensis), sur-named Doctor Irrefragabilis and Fons Vitae, a celebrated English theologian of the 13th century. Born in Gloucestershire, and trained in the monastery of Hales, from which he takes his name, he was early raised to an archdeaconry. Relinquishing this position, however, he went, like most of the scholars of his day, to study at the university of Paris, where he took the degree of doctor, and became celebrated as a teacher of philosophy and theology. Among his pupils was Bonaventura; but it is evident from a comparison of dates that he did not teach Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas, as has been frequently asserted. In 1222, when at the height of his fame, Alexander entered the order of Minorite Friars, and thenceforward lived in strict seclusion. He refused, however, to renounce his degree of doctor, and was the first of his order who continued to bear that title after initiation. He died in 1245, and was buried in the convent of the Cordeliers at Paris, where he had spent the last twenty-three years of his life. The most celebrated work of Alexander was his Summa Theologiae (Nuremberg, 1452; Venice, 1576), undertaken by the orders of Pope Innocent IV., and approved by Alexander IV., after he had submitted it to the examination of seventy learned theologians as a system of instruction for all the schools in Christendom. Based on the Sentences of Peter Lombard, it is divided into four parts; the first treating of the nature and attributes of the Deity; the second of the creation and of the various orders of creatures; the third of the scheme of redemption, the incarnation of Christ, the law, and grace; and the fourth of the sacraments. The form is that of question and answer, and the method is rigidly scholastic.
