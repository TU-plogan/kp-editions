ANACONDA, a gigantic snake of South America, sometimes over 30 feet in length, called the water-serpent, from frequenting swamps and rivers, and preying on water animals. Its colour is a rich brown, with bright golden rings on each side, and two rows of large black spots along the back. The natives kill it for an oil they obtain from its carcase. It is not venomous, and is said to be harmless.
