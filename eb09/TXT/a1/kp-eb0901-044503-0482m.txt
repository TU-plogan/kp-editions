ALB, or Albe, a vestment of white linen, hanging down to the feet, worn by priests at all the more solemn services of the church. It corresponds to the surplice of the English clergy, the difference being that the alb is closer in the sleeves, and bound at the waist by a girdle. In the ancient church it was customary for the neophytes who were baptized on Easter-day to wear an alb for the eight days following, and hence the Sunday after Easter was called Dominica in Albis.
