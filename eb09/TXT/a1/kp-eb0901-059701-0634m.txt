ALOE. Aloes is a medicinal substance used as a purgative, and produced from various species of aloe, such as A. spicata, vulgaris, socotrina, indica, and purpurascens, all belonging to the natural order Liliaceae. Several kinds of aloes are distinguished in commerceâ€”Barbadoes, soco-trine, hepatic, Indian, and Cape aloes. The first two are those commonly used for medicinal purposes. Aloes is the inspissated juice of the leaves of the plant. When the leaves are cut the juice flows out, and is collected and evaporated. After the juice has been obtained, the leaves are sometimes boiled, so as to yield an inferior kind of aloes. The active principle is called aloein. Aloes is used in the form of extract, pill, tincture, and wine. It is irritant, and requires to be used with caution.

The plant called American aloe belongs to a different order, viz., Amaryllidaceae. The plant is called Agave Americana. The juice of the plant, taken immediately before flowering, is used in America for the manufacture of an intoxicating beverage. In Ecuador the spongy substance of the flower stem is used instead of tinder, and in the schools the green leaves serve as paper. A punishment among the Aztecs was introducing the spiny points of the leaves into the skin. The plant often delays flowering for many years, and then pushes up a flowering stalk with great rapidity, sometimes at the rate of 1 foot or even 2 feet in twenty-four hours. The fibrous matter procured from the agave by maceration supplies pita flax.

The aloes or lign aloes of the Bible (Numb. xxiv. 6, and Psalm xlv. 8) is quite different from the medicinal aloes. The Hebrew words ahalim and ahaloth, and the Greek word aloe, are. rendered aloes in our version of the Scriptures. The substance is supposed by some to be the fragrant wood of Aquilaria Agallochum, a plant belonging to the natural order Aquilariaceae. There are, however, considerable doubts as to the correctness of this view, more especially as the tree is a native of Cochin China, Silhet, and Northern India, and is not found in Chaldea or Syria. From the allusion made to the trees of lign aloes by Balaam, it seems probable that they were known as growing in Syria. It is quite possible, however, that the precious fragrant substance called aloes, and mentioned in Scripture along with cinnamon, cassia, myrrh, and spices, may have been brought from India. As a perfume it is noted in Psalm xlv. 8; Prov. vii. 17; Song of Sol. iv. 14. The use of aloes in perfuming the coverings of the dead is referred to in John xix. 39, 40.
