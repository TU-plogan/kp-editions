AMAUROSIS (άμαύρωσις ), a deprivation of sight. The term is now limited chiefly to those forms of defect or loss of vision which are caused by diseases not directly involving the eye, although sooner or later the optic nerve undergoes changes recognisable by the ophthalmoscope. Sometimes the amaurosis is temporary, disappearing with the removal of the disease with which it is associated; but in many cases, more especially where the brain and spinal cord are affected, the amaurosis remains permanent.
