AMMANATI, Bartolomeo, a celebrated Florentino architect and sculptor, was born in 1511, and died in 1592. He studied under Bandinelli and Sansovius, and closely imitated the style of Michael Angelo. He was more distinguished in architecture than in sculpture. He designed many buildings in Rome, Lucca, and Florence, an addition to the Pitti palace in the last-named city being one of his most celebrated works. He also planned the beautiful bridge over the Arno, known as Ponte della Trinita— one of his celebrated works. The three arches are elliptic, and though very light and elegant, have resisted the fury of the river, which has swept away several other bridges at different times. Ammanati’s wife, daughter of Giov. Antonio Battiferri, an elegant and accomplished woman, published a volume of poems of considerable merit.
