AGAPETUS, deacon of the St Sophia Church at Constantinople, presented to the Emperor Justinian a work entitled Charta Regia, composed in 527, which contained advice on the duties of a Christian prince. It is highly valued, and has been several times reprinted. The best edition is that contained in Bandauri’s Imperium Orientale (Paris, 1711). There is an English translation by Thomas Paynell (1550); and a French translation, executed from a Latin version by Louis XIII., with the assistance of his tutor, David Rivault.
