ALAND ISLANDS, an archipelago at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia, about 25 miles from the coast of Sweden, and 15 from that of Finland. The group consists of nearly 300 islands, of which about 80 are inhabited, the remainder being desolate rocks. These islands form a continuation of a dangerous granite reef extending along the south coast of Finland. They formerly belonged to Sweden; and in the neighbourhood the first victory of the Russian fleet over the Swedes was gained by Peter the Great in 1714. They finally passed into the possession of Russia in 1809. The inhabitants, amounting to about 16,000, are mostly of Swedish descent, and are hardy seamen and fishermen. The surface of the islands is generally sandy, the soil is thin, and the climate is keen; yet Scotch fir, spruce, and birch are grown; and rye, barley, flax, and vegetables are produced in sufficient quantity for the wants of the people. Great numbers of cattle are reared; and cheese, butter, and hides, as well as salted meat and fish, are exported. The largest island, which gives its name to the group, is 18 miles long by 14 broad, and contains about two-thirds of the total population. There are several excellent harbours (notably that of Ytternaes), which are of great importance to Russia from the fact that they are frozen up for a much briefer period than those on the coast of Finland. The fortress of Bomarsund, in one of these islands, was attacked and destroyed by an Anglo-French force in 1854.
