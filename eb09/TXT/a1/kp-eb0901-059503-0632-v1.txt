ALMORÁ, the principal town in the British district of Kumáon, within the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces, is situated in 29° 35' N. lat., and 790° 42' E. long. The town is built on the crest of a ridge of the Himálayas, running cast and west, and 5337 feet above sea-level. It consists chiefly of a single street, about 50 feet wide and three-quarters of a mile long, closed by a gate at each end. A few detached houses, inhabited by Europeans, are scattered along the face of the mountain below the town. The town was captured by the Gurkhás in 1790, who constructed a fort on the eastern extremity of the ridge. Another citadel, Fort Moira, is situated on the other extremity of the ridge. Almorá is also celebrated as the scene of the British victory which terminated the war with Nepál in April 1815, and which resulted in the evacuation of Kumáon by the Gurkhás, and the annexation of the province by the British. According to the census of 1872, the town contains a population of 5900 souls. It has been constituted a municipality, the revenue and expenditure of which in 1871-72 is returned as follows :—Revenue—Receipts from octroi, £29, 16s.; housetax, £211, 8s.; other sources of income, £30, 14s.: total, £271, 18s. Expenditure—Establishment, including cost of collection, police, and conservancy, £182; repairs, £90, 16s.; other items, £3, 16s.: total, £276, 12s.
