ALKANET(Alkanna tinctoria, or Anchusa tinctoria), a plant of the order Boraginaceoe, indigenous to the south of France and the shores of the Levant. It is extensively cultivated on the Continent for the sake of the root, which yields a fine colouring matter, imparting a beautiful canmine tint to oils, wines, wax, and all unctuous substances. Being perfectly harmless, alkanet is much used for colouring in pharmacy. Some of the mixtures styled port wine owe their colour to this dye, and it is also employed in staining furniture.
