ALDRICH, Dr Henry, theologian and philosopher, was born in 1647 at Westminster, and was educated at the collegiate school there, under Dr Busby. In 1662 he entered Christ Church College, Oxford, with which he continued to be intimately connected during his whole life. He took so conspicuous a part in the controversy with the Roman Catholics during the reign of James IL, that at the Revolution the deanery of Christ Church was conferred upon him, Massey, the popish dean, having fled to the continent. In 1702 he was appointed rector of Wem in Shropshire, but continued to reside at Oxford, where he died on the 14th Dec. 1710. He was buried in the cathedral without any memorial, at his own desire. Aldrich was a man of unusually varied gifts. He is best known as the author of a Compendium Artis Logicae, a work of almost no value in itself, but historically important as being for upwards of a century the manual in exclusive use at Oxford. His claims to distinction as a musician and an architect, though not so widely recognised, are much better founded than his reputation as a logician. He composed a number of anthems and church services of very considerable merit, which are still frequently sung in cathedrals. He also adapted much of the music of Palestrina and Carissimi to English words with great skill and judgment. The catch “Hark, the bonny Christ Church bells” is one of his most admired compositions in the lighter style. Aldrich wrote a treatise on architecture; and practical evidence of his skill in the art may be seen in the church and campanile of All Saints, Oxford, and in three sides of the so-called Peckwater Quadrangle of Christ Church College, which were erected after his designs.

In classical scholarship Dr Aldrich had some reputation. The Musae Anglicanoe contains two specimens of his Latin verse, the subjects being the accession of King William and the death of the Duke of Gloucester. A humorous Latin version by Aldrich of the popular ballad—
“A soldier and a sailor,
A tinker and a tailor,” &c.,

has been preserved by Sir John Hawkins. Another specimen of his wit is furnished by the following epigram, entitled “Causae Bibendi,” which some, however, have ascribed to Père Sirmond :—
Si bene quiet memini, Causae sunt quinque bibendi;
Hospitis Adventus, praesens Sitis, atque futura,
Aut Vini Bonitas, aut quoelibet altera Causa.

The translation runs—
If on my theme I rightly think,
There are five reasons why men drink
Good wine; a friend; because I'm dry;
Or lest I should be by and by;
Or—any other reason why.
