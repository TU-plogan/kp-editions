ADJUDICATION, in Scottish Law, the name of that action by which a creditor attaches the heritable, i.e., the real, estate of his debtor, or his debtorâ€™s heir, in order to appropriate it to himself either in payment or security of his debt. The term is also applied to a proceeding of the same nature by which the holder of an heritable right, labouring under any defect in point of form, gets that defect supplied by decree of a court.

Adjudication in Bankruptcy, in English Law, is equivalent to the Scotch award of sequestration.
