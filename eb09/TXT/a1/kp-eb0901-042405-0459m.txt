AIDAN, a king of Scottish Dalriada, who reigned about the close of the 6th century. He usurped the succession from the son of Conall, and was crowned by Columba, who personally preferred another, and, it is said, was compelled to perform the ceremony by an interposition of divine power. During Aidanâ€™s reign the Scottish Dalriada was completely freed from subjection to the Irish monarchs. (See Adamnan, lib. iii., c. 5; and Bede.)
