ALENÇON, the chief town of the French department of Orne, situated in a wide and fertile plain, on the Sarthe, close to its confluence with the Briante. It is a clean, regularly-built town, with broad handsome streets. It is the seat of a bishop; and the Gothic church of Notre Dame, called the cathedral, is a fine building of the 16th century. The only remains of the ancient castle of Alençon are three towers that form part of the present town-hall. The lace known as “point d’Alençon” is the most noted manufacture of the town, although of late years its importance has somewhat diminished. Among the other industries are tanning, spinning, bleaching, linen manufacturing, and cider-making. The cutting of quartz crystals, often called Alençon diamonds, is also carried on. Alençon was a place of small importance when it was handed over to the Normans by Charles the Simple in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1025 it became subject to the De Belesmes, counts of Alençon, by whom it was enlarged and fortified. It was ceded to King Philip Augustus in 1221 by Alice, the heiress of the last count. The duchy of Alençon was created about the end of the 14th century, and remained with the original family, a branch of the house of Valois, until the middle of the 16th. The town was repeatedly taken and retaken in wars with Henry V. and Henry VL of England, and also in the time of the League. In the war between France and Germany, Alençon was taken by the Germans under the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg on the 17th of January 1871. The townspeople did not offer much resistance. The mayor and municipality were, indeed, in favour of yielding without a struggle; but the newly-appointed prefect, an ultra-republican, insisted on a more martial policy. A feeble skirmish took place outside the town on the evening of the 16th of January, and the grand duke entered on the following morning without any further opposition. The Germans, as a punishment for the previous resistance, imposed on the citizens a fine of 300,000 francs, besides a large contribution of cattle, corn, and other provisions. Population (1872), 16,037.
