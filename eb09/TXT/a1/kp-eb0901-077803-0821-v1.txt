AMSANCTI (or AMPSANCTI) VALLIS, a valley with a small sulphureous lake and cavern in the territory of the Hirpini, or Principato Ultra (east of Naples), about four miles from the town of Frigento (Cicero, Pliny), or eight from Gesualdo. The spot can most easily be visited by railway from Ariano, on the Naples and Benevento line. It is described by Virgil (Aen. vii. 563-71) as an outlet from a cave giving access to the infernal regions :—
“Hic specus horrendum, saevi spiracula Ditis,
Monstratur, ruptoque ingens Acheronte vorago
Pestiferas aperit fauces; quis condita Erinnys,
Invisum numen, terras coelumque levabat.”

The modern name is Le Mofete, after the goddess Mephitis, who, according to Pliny (N.H. ii. 95), had a temple here, of which there are no remains. The lake is considered by Dr C. T. Ramage (who made a special visit to it) as of volcanic character, and appears to lie on the edge of a crater-shaped valley. “The water,” he says, “had a dark, pitchy appearance, and was thrown up occasionally in several places to the height of 4 or 5 feet. At the edge (of the crater) we were possibly 40 feet above the water, and we did not dare to descend, as the exhalations of sulphur were so strong that we should have been suffocated long before we reached the water. . . . . In fact, the whole of this country seems to be volcanic, and is constantly subject to earthquakes.” (See Nooks and Byways of Italy, by C. T. Ramage, LL.D., 1868; Swinbumds Travels, vol. i., Murray’s Handbook for South Italy, 1873.)
