ALCINOUS, a mythical king of the Phaeacians, in the island of Scheria, was son of Nausithous, and grandson of Neptune and Periboea. He has been immortalised in the Odyssey, the description of his reception and entertainment of Ulysses, who when cast by a storm on the shore of the island was relieved by the kingâ€™s daughter, Nausicaa, forming the main subject of books vi. to xiii. of that poem. The subjects of Alcinous loved pleasure and good cheer, yet were skilful seamen; and he himself is described as a good prince.
