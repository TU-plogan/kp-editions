ALDINI, Giovanni, a distinguished physicist, born at Bologna on the 10th April 1762 (died 1834), was the nephew of Galvani, and brother of the statesman Count Antonio Aldini. Devoted from his youth to the study of natural science, he was chosen in 1798 to succeed his former teacher Canterzani in the chair of physics at Bologna. His most important service consisted in the numerous experiments by which he sought to secure the better application of science to practical purposes. The subjects of galvanism, the illumination of lighthouses by gas, and an asbestos or fireproof fabric engaged his special attention, and on all of them he published the results of his researches. He was master of the leading European languages; and most of his works were published in Italian, French, and [9:1:475] English. Aldini was one of the founders of the National Institute of Italy, and among his scientific honours he counted the gold medal of the Royal Society of London, and the prize of the Institute of France. In recognition of his merits, the emperor of Austria made him a knight of the Iron Crown and a councillor of state at Milan, where he died on the 17th January 1834. He left by will a considerable sum to found a school of natural science for artisans at Bologna.
