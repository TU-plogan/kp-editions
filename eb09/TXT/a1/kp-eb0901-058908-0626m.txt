AL-MAMUN (also written Al-Mamoun, Al-Mamon, and simply Mamun), one of the most renowned of the Abbasside dynasty of caliphs, was born in 786 a.d. He was the son of Harun-al-Raschid, whose caliphate is the golden age of Mahometan history. Harun, dying in 808, left the supremacy to his son Al-Amin, Al-Mamun being at the time governor of Khorassan, and favourable to the succession of his brother. Irritated, however, by the treatment he received at the hands of Amin, and supported by a portion of the army, Mamun speedily betook himself to arms. The result was a five years’ struggle between the two brothers, ending in the death of Amin, 4th October 813, and the proclamation of Al-Mamun as caliph at Baghdad. Various factions and revolts, which disturbed the first years of his reign, were readily quelled by his prudent and energetic measures. But a much more serious rebellion, stirred up by his countenancing the heretical sect of Ali and adopting their colours, soon after threatened his throne. His crown was actually on the head of his uncle Ibrahim ben Mahdi (surnamed Mobarek) for a short time, and a civil war with the orthodox Mussulmans was imminent, when the timely death of Mamun’s vizier and of the imam Rizza removed his principal heretical advisers, and restored the people to their allegiance. This inaugurated a period of tranquillity, which Al-Mamun employed in patronising and fostering the cultivation of literature and science throughout his empire. He had already, while governor of Khorassan, founded a college there, and attracted to it the most eminent men of the [9:1:590] day; and now Baghdad became, under his auspices, the seat of academical instruction and the centre of intelligence. At his own expense he caused to be translated into Arabic many valuable books from the Greek, Persian, Chaldean, and Coptic languages; and he was himself an ardent student of mathematics and astronomy. The first Arabic translation of Euclid was dedicated to him in 813. Mamun founded observatories at Baghdad and Kassiun (near Damascus) for astronomical purposes, and he succeeded in determining the inclination of the ecliptic. He also caused a degree of the meridian to be measured on the plain of Shinar; and he constructed astronomical tables, which are said to be wonderfully accurate. The supposed antagonism of orthodoxy and science receives some support from the conduct of Mamun. A lover of philosophy and letters, he did not concern himself about the creed of the professors he appointed to his colleges, or the physicians he employed at his court; and on the occasion of his marriage he distributed largesses to Mussulmans, Jews, and Christians indiscriminately. These liberal measures culminated, however, in his becoming a convert in 827 to the heterodox faith of the Motasali, who asserted the free-will of man and denied the eternity of the Koran. The later years (829-830) of his reign were distracted by hostilities with the Greek emperor Theophilus, occasioned, it is said, by a dispute about an eminent Greek priest whom the caliph wished to attach to his college at Baghdad. A series of revolts in different parts of the Arabian empire betokened the decline of the military glory of the caliphs. Already had Spain and part of Africa asserted their independence, and Egypt and Syria were now inclined to follow. In 833, after quelling Egypt, at least nominally, Mamun marched into Cilicia to prosecute the war with the Greeks; but with this expedition the career of one of the most famous of the caliphs was to terminate. He died near Tarsus, leaving his crown to a younger brother, Motassem. The death of Al-Mamun ended an important epoch in the history of science and letters, and the period of Arabian prosperity which his father’s reign had begun. The influence of these two sovereigns is sometimes exaggerated; but there can be no doubt we owe much to their exertions at a time when Europe was sunk in barbarism. Mamun was the author of Inquiries into the Koran, of a tract on the Signs of Prophecy, and of one on the Rhetoric of the Priests and Panegyrists of the Caliphs.
