ANATHEMA(ανάθεμα, from άνατίθημι, lit. anything offered up) is frequently used in classic Greek (in the form ανάθημα) to denote things consecrated to the gods, and deposited in a temple. In the LXX. it is the equivalent of the Hebrew β**>, which denotes an offering devoted to God absolutely, and therefore, in the case of a living creature, put to death. The idea of destruction or perdition thus became associated with the word, which gradually lost its primary sense of consecration. In the New Testament it signifies separated from the church and accursed, and it became the technical term for a form of excommunication at an early date.
