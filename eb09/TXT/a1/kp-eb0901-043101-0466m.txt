AISNE, a frontier department in the north-east of France, bounded on the N. by the department of Nord and the kingdom of Belgium, on the E. by the department of Ardennes, on the S.E. by that of Marne, on the S. by that of Seine-et-Marne, and on the W. by those of Oise and Somme; extending at the widest points 75 miles from N. to S., and 53 from E. to W., with an area of 2838 square miles. The surface of the department consists of fine undulating plains, diversified in the north by hilly ground which forms a part of the mountain system of the Ardennes. The chief rivers are the Somme, the Escaut, and the Sambre in the north; the Oise, traversing the north-west, with its tributaries the Serre and the Aisne, the latter of which joins it beyond the limits of the department; and the Mame and the Ourcq in the south. The soil of Aisne is, as a whole, fertile, and in some parts very rich, yielding wheat, barley, rye, oats, hops, flax, fruit, beetroot, and potatoes; there is good pasturage, and much attention is paid to the rearing of cattle, sheep, and horses. Wine is produced, but, except in the valley of the Marne, its quality is inferior. Large tracts of the department are under wood, the chief forests being those of Nouvion and St Michel in the north, Coucy and St Gobain in the centre, and Villers-Cotterets in the south. There are no minerals of importance in the department, but good building-stone and slates of a fair quality are found. Aisne is an important manufacturing department; its chief industrial products being shawls and muslin—as well as other cotton, linen, and woollen goods—glass, including the famous mirrors of St Gobain, iron wares, beetroot sugar, leather, and pottery. It has a good trade, which is much facilitated by railroads (the most important being those between Paris and Strasbourg, and Paris and Mons), canals, and the navigable portions of the rivers. Aisne, which is composed of parts of the ancient provinces of Picardy and the Isle of France, is divided into five arrondissements—St Quentin and Vervins in the north, Laon in the centre, and Soissons and Chateau Thierry in the south. It contains in all 37 cantons and 837 communes. Laon is the capital, and Soissons the seat of the bishop. The other towns of importance are Chauny, St Quentin, Vervins, Hirson, Suise, Villers-Cotterets, and Chateau Thierry. Population in 1872, 552,439, of whom 183,104 could neither read nor write, and 28,651 could read, but could not write.
