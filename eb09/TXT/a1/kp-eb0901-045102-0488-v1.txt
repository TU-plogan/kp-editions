+=====================================================================+


ALBERT, Margrave of Brandenburg and first Duke of Prussia, third son of the Margrave Friedrich of Anspach, was born on the 17th May 1490. Being intended for the church, he was educated by Archbishop Hermann of Cologne, and became a canon of Cologne cathedral. He seems, however, to have himself preferred a military life, as he accompanied his father in the train of the emperor on an expedition to Venice, and was present at the siege of Pavia. On the 13th Feb. 1511 he joined the Teutonic order; and a few days after, though scarcely twenty-one years old, was chosen grand master, it being expected that, as nephew of Sigismund of Poland, he would be able to secure the privileges and immunities which the order were at the time claiming from that monarch. The refusal of Albert to swear allegiance to Sigismund led, after protracted negotiations, which proved fruitless, to a war with Poland in 1520. A four years’ truce being concluded at Thorn in 1521, Albert repaired to the diet at Nuremberg to invoke the aid of his brother German princes on behalf of his order. The diet found itself unable to render him any assistance, and at the same time he received advice from Luther which altogether changed his purpose. Embracing the doctrines of the Reformation, he was declared Duke of Prussia, consented to hold the duchy as a fief from Poland, and took the oath of allegiance at Cracow on the 9th April 1525. At the same time he resigned the grand mastership of the order. In 1527 he married Anne Dorothea, daughter of the king of Denmark. His subsequent reign was marked by zealous efforts, amid many difficulties, to promote the welfare of his duchy. He interested himself especially in the advancement of learning, inviting men of letters to his court, and promoting the publication of their writings. In 1544 he founded the university of Königsberg, in spite of great opposition, chiefly from the pope. Keen theological disputes between the professors of this university were among the many troubles of his later years. He died of the plague on the 20th of March 1568. His second wife, the Princess Anna Maria of Brunswick, who had been attacked by the same disease, survived him only a single day.
