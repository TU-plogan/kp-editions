ABILA, a city of ancient Syria, the capital of the tetrarchy of Abilene, a territory whose limits and extent it is impossible now to define. The site of Abila is indicated by some ruins and inscriptions on the banks of the river Barada, between Baalbec and Damascus, about twelve miles from the latter city. Though the names Abel and Abila differ in derivation and in meaning, their similarity has given rise to the tradition that this was the scene of Abelâ€™s death.
