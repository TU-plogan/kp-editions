ALCESTER, pronounced Auster, a market town in the county of Warwick, situated at the junction of the Arrow and Alne, 14 miles W.S.W. of Warwick. Its position on the Roman way known as the Ickenild Street, and the discovery of numerous remains of ancient art, as well as urns and coins, make it sufficiently evident that this was a Roman encampment. A monastery was founded here in 1140; but the building has totally disappeared, though sufficient vestiges remain to indicate its site. The church is a fine building, and contains several interesting monuments, one of which, to the marquis of Hertford, is by Chantrey, and is in the best style of that sculptor. The town possesses a free grammar school and an elegant market-hall. Employment is afforded to about 1200 of the inhabitants in the manufacture of needles, which is the chief branch of industry. Fish-hooks are also manufactured. Population of parish, 2363.
