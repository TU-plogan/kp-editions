ADANA, a city of Asia Minor, the capital of the province of the same name, on the right bank of the Sihun, about 30 miles from the sea, in N. lat. 37° 1', E. long. 35° 18'. It is built on the site of the ancient Antiochia ad Sarum. Its position, commanding the passage of the mountains to the north of Syria, rendered it important as a military station in the contest between the Egyptians and the Turks in 1832. After the defeat of the Turkish army at Konieh, it was taken possession of by Ibrahim Pacha, and continued to be held by the Egyptians till the treaty of July 1840 restored it to the Porte. In the streets of the town there are numerous beautiful fountains, supplied with water from the river, which is here spanned by a stately bridge of fifteen arches, said to have been erected by Justinian. In winter the climate is mild and healthy, but in summer the heat is so great that the principal inhabitants betake themselves to various cool retreats in the neighbouring mountains. The adjoining plain of Adana is rich and fertile. The chief productions of the province are cotton, corn, sesame, and wool, which are largely exported. The population of the town is 20,000.
