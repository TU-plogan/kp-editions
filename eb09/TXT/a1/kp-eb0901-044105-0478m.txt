ALAN, Allen, or Allyn, William (1532-94), cardinal, was born at Rossall in Lancashire. He studied at Oriel College, Oxford, and was appointed principal of St Mary’s Hall in 1556. Two years later he was made a canon of York; but being opposed to the Reformation, was forced to flee to Louvain on the accession of Elizabeth. He returned to England after a time, and for some years resided chiefly at Oxford; but his proselytising zeal being discovered, necessitated a second flight. At Douay he received a doctor’s degree from the recently-founded university, and he himself established a college there for English Catholics. In 1587 he was made cardinal of St Martin de Montibus, and in 1589 archbishop of Mechlin. The great aim of his life seems to have been to restore the papal supremacy in England. For this purpose he founded the college at Douay, and sent over the Jesuit priests trained there to his native land. He was, of course, a bitter enemy of Elizabeth, who expelled his emissaries, and even caused some of them to be put to death. One of his pamphlets, prepared for circulation among the English people, contained charges against the queen so foul and scurrilous that they can scarcely be repeated. It was only natural that he should be one of the chief intriguers in the Spanish plot which led to the fitting out of the Armada, especially as the pope had promised him the archbishopric of Canterbury in the event of the expedition being successful. His letters to Philip were full of encouragement, and the failure of the enterprise must have been a severe blow to him. When the fact became known, he lost favour at the papal court, and was refused permission to return to his diocese.
