AEOLIS, or Aeolia, in Ancient Geography, a country of Asia Minor, settled by colonics of Aeolian Greeks. The [9:1:183] name in its limited sense was applied to the coast extending from the river Hermus to the promontory of Lectum, on the north side cf the entrance to the Gulf of Adramyttium, and lying between Ionia to the S. and Troas to the N. In its wider acceptation it comprehended Troas and the coasts of the Hellespont to the Propontis, where there were likewise several Aeolian colonies.
