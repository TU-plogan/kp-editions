AMBROSE or Alexandria lived in the beginning of the third century. Jerome and Eusebius differ in the account they give of him, the one calling him a Marcionite, the other a Valentinian; but they agree in alleging that he was converted to the orthodox faith by the preaching of Origen. Origen dedicated many of his works, among others his book On Martyrdom, to Ambrose, at whose desire and expense they were published, and the two lived on terms of the most intimate friendship. According to some, Ambrose died a martyr in the persecution under Maximin, about the year 236; but the dedication of Origen’s Eight Books against Celsus proves that he lived to the year 250, or near that period. Origen speaks of him as a man of sincere piety, and much devoted to the study of the Scriptures.
