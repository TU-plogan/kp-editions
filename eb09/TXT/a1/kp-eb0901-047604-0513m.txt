ALEANDRO, Girolamo (Hieronymus), cardinal, commonly called “the Elder,” to distinguish him from his grand-nephew of the same name, was born at Motta, near Venice, on the 13th of February 1480 (died 1542). He studied at Venice, and while still a youth acquired great reputation for learning. In 1508 he went to Paris, on the invitation of Louis XII., as professor of belles lettres, and he held for a time the position of rector in the university. Entering the service of the prince-bishop of Liege, he was sent by that prelate on a mission to Rome, where Pope Leo X. retained him, giving him (1519) the office of librarian of the Vatican. In the autumn of 1520 he went to Germany to be present as papal nuncio at the coronation of Charles V., and in the following spring he appeared at the diet of Worms, where he headed the opposition to Luther, advocating the most extreme measures to repress the doctrines of the Reformer. His conduct not merely called forth the fiercest denunciations of Luther, but estranged from him Erasmus, who had been his intimate friend at Venice. The edict against the Reformer, which was finally adopted by the emperor and the diet, was drawn up and proposed by Aleandro. After the close of the diet the papal nuncio went to the Netherlands, where he kindled the flames of persecution, two monks of Antwerp, the first martyrs of the Reformation, being burnt to ashes in Brussels at his instigation. In 1523, Clement VII., having appointed him archbishop of Brindisi and Oria, sent him as nuncio to the court of Francis I. He was taken prisoner along with that monarch at the battle of Pavia (1525), and was only released on the payment of a heavy ransom. He was subsequently employed on various papal missions, especially to Germany, but was unsuccessful in preventing the German princes from making a truce with the Reformers, or in checking to any extent the progress of the new doctrines. In 1538 Paul III. conferred upon him the cardinal’s hat, when he took the title of St Chrysogonus. He died at Rome on the 31st January or 1st February 1542.

Aleandro compiled a Lexicon Gr ae co-Latinum, and wrote Latin verse of considerable merit. The Vatican library contains a volume of manuscript letters and other documents written by him in connection with his various missions against Luther. Its historical value renders this the most important of his works.
