ALMANSA, a town of Spain, in the province of Albacete, 35 miles E.S.E. of the town of that name, on the Madrid and Alicante railway. The surrounding plain is very fertile, and irrigated by means of a large reservoir. There are manufactures of linen and cotton fabrics, and also of brandy, leather, and soap. A Moorish castle is to be seen on a hill to the north-west of the town. About a mile from Almansa stands an obelisk commemorating the decisive battle fought here on 25th April 1707, in which the French, under the Duke of Berwick, the natural son of James II. of England, completely defeated the allied English and Spanish armies. The French greatly outnumbered the opposing force. This battle hastened the conclusion of the war of the Spanish succession. Population of the town, about 8000.
