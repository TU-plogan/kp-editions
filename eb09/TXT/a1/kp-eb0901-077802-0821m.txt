AMRU-EL-KAIS, an Arabian poet, contemporary with Mahomet. He wrote one of the seven Moallakat (Suspended), or poems, composed before the promulgation of Mahometanism, which derived their name from the fact that they were suspended in the Kaaba at Mecca. He was hostile to the claims of the prophet, and wrote verses against him. It is said that his death was occasioned by his wearing a poisoned shirt presented to him by the Greek emperor Heraclius, to whom he had gone to ask aid against the Beni-Asad, his own tribe. The story is, however, discredited by Abulfeda. The Moallakat of Amru, in the original text, was published by Lette at Leyden in 1848, and an English translation by Sir William Jones appeared in 1782. The edition of Hengstenberg (Bonn, 1823) contains a Latin version. Another edition, by Arnold, appeared at Leipsic in 1850. The edition of Baron MacGuckin Slane (Paris, 1837) includes the miscellaneous poems, a translation, notes, and a life of the poet.
