AEGOSPOTAMI, in Ancient Geography, a small river in the Thracian Chersonesus, running south-east, and falling into the Hellespont to the north of Sestos,â€”with a town of the same name, and a station or road for ships, at its mouth. Here the Athenians under Conon, through the fault of his colleague Philocles, received a signal overthrow from the Lacedemonians under Lysander (b.c. 405), which involved the taking of Athens, and put an end to the Peloponnesian war. The town does not appear to have existed till after the date of the battle.
