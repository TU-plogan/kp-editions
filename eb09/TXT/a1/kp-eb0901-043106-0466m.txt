AIX-LA-CHAPELLE, the German Aachen, the capital of a district of the same name in Rhenish Prussia, situated near the Wurm, a tributary of the Meuse, in a pleasant and fertile valley about 40 miles west of Cologne, with which it is connected by railway. It is well built, and is enclosed by ramparts that have been converted into promenades, and its appearance is rather that of a prosperous modern town than of an ancient city full of historical [9:1:432] associations. Its town-house, built in 1353 on the ruins of Charlemagne’s palace, contains the magnificent coronation hall of the German emperors, 162 feet long by 60 feet wide. Near the town-house are two ancient towers, one of which, called the Granusthurm, is sometimes said to be of Roman origin; and a fountain, with a statue of Charlemagne, which was erected in 1620. The cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle consists of two parts, distinct both as to the time of their erection and their style of architecture. The older portion may be said to date either from 796 a.d., when it was erected by Charlemagne as the palace chapel, or from 983, when it was rebuilt on the old model by Otho III., after having been almost entirely destroyed by the Normans. It consists of an octagon, planned after that of St Vitale at Ravenna, surrounded by a sixteensided gallery, and terminating in a cupola. It contains the tomb of Charlemagne, which was opened in the year 1000, when the body of the emperor was found seated on a marble throne which was afterwards used in the imperial coronation ceremonies. The Gothic choir, which forms the more modern portion of the cathedral, was added during the latter half of the 14th and the beginning of the 15th centuries. The cathedral possesses many relics, the most sacred of which are exhibited only once every seven years, when they attract large crowds of worshippers. Besides these buildings, almost the only other of any antiquity is the com exchange, probably of the 12th century. Of modern edifices, Aix-la-Chapelle possesses a theatre, a public library, a gymnasium, and several churches and hospitals. The chief manufactures of Aix-la-Chapelle are woollen cloths, stockings, shawls, silks, leather, glass, needles, pins, machines, general ironmongery, carriages, beer, brandy, tobacco, and chemicals. There is a good trade in these articles, not only with Germany and other continental countries, but also, in the case of cloth especially, with the United States of America. The hot sulphur springs of Aix-la-Chapelle are another important source of revenue to the inhabitants. These springs were known to the Romans, and have long been celebrated for the cure of rheumatism and gout. There are six in all, of which the Kaiserquelle is the chief, with a temperature reaching as high as 136° Fahr. There are also two cold chalybeate springs. Aix-la-Chapelle is the Aquisgranum, or Civitas Aquensis, of the Romans. Charlemagne, who perhaps was born and certainly died in the town, made it the second city of his empire and the capital of his dominions north of the Alps. He conferred numerous privileges upon its citizens, exempting them from military service and from all taxes, even when they were living in other parts of the empire. From 813 to 1531 the emperors of Germany were crowned at Aix-la-chapelle, which during that period became one of the most important free imperial cities, although it was ravaged by the Normans in 851, and again in 882. By the removal of the coronations to Frankfort, Aix-la-Chapelle lost its leading position in Germany, and its internal prosperity was much injured by a disastrous fire in 1656. During the revolution it for a time belonged to France, but in 1815 it was ceded to Prussia, and has now become one of the chief seats of commerce in that kingdom. Population of Aix-la-chapelle (1871), 74,238.

Aix-La-Chapelle, Congresses and Treaties of. The first congress of Aix-la-Chapelle concerned the succession of Maria Theresa to the empire. It was held in 1748, and resulted in the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, signed in the same year, by which Maria Theresa was left in possession of most of her hereditary dominions, the chief exception being Silesia, which was ceded to Prussia. The second congress, held in 1818, resulted in the convention of Aix-la-Chapelle. The object of this congress was the regulation of the affairs of Europe, especially of France, after the war. A treaty of peace between France and Spain was also signed in this city in 1668, whereby Louis XIV. gave up his claim to the Spanish Netherlands, but was left in possession of much that he had already conquered.
