ALMOND. This is the fruit of Amygdalus communis, a plant belonging to the natural order Rosaceae, sub-order Amygdaleae or Drupiferae. The tree appears to be a native of Asia, Barbary, and Marocco; but it has been extensively distributed over the warm temperate region of the Old World. It is a tree of moderate size; the leaves are oblong-lanceolate, and serrated at the edges; and the flowers, which appear early in spring, are of a pink colour. The fruit is a drupe, having a downy outer coat, called the epicarp, covering a tough portion called the mesocarp, which encloses the reticulated hard stony shell or endocarp. The seed is the kernel which is contained within these coverings. The shell-almonds of trade consist of the endocarps enclosing the seeds. The tree grows in Syria and

Palestine; and is referred to in the Bible under the name of Shaked, meaning “hasten.” The word Luz, which occurs in Genesis xxx. 37, and which has been translated hazel, is supposed to be another name for the almond. In Palestine the tree flowers in January, and this hastening of the period of flowering seems to be alluded to in Jeremiah i. 11, 12, where the Lord asks the prophet, “What seest thou?” and he replies, “The rod of an almond-tree;” and the Lord says, “Thou hast well seen, for I will hasten my word to perform it.” In Ecclesiastes xii. 5 it is said the “almond-tree shall flourish.” This has often been supposed to refer to the resemblance of the hoary locks of age to the flowers of the almond; but this exposition is not borne out by the facts of the case, inasmuch as the flowers of the almond are not white but pink. The passage is more probably intended to allude to the hastening or rapid approach of old age. The application of Shaked or hasten to the almond is similar to the use of the name “May” for the hawthorn, which usually flowers in that month in Britain. The rod of Aaron, mentioned in Numbers xvii., was taken from an almond-tree; and the Jews still carry rods of almond-blossom to the synagogues on great festival days. The fruit of the almond supplied a model for certain kinds of ornamental carved work. (Exodus xxv. 33, 34; xxxvii. 19, 20). Dr Tristram remarks: “The blossom of the almond is a very pale pink, but where, as in the [9:1:595] orchards near Nablous (Shechem), the peach and almond trees are intermingled, the almond looks white by comparison. In early spring it forms a beautiful feature in the landscape there, as the lower slopes of Gerizim, as well as the valley, are studded with almonds and peaches, in lively contrast with the deep green foliage of the orange-trees, and rivalling an apple orchard in splendour of colour. There are also many wild almond-trees on Mount Carmel. The tree seldom exceeds 12 to 16 feet in height.” There are two varieties of the plant, the one producing sweet, the other bitter almonds. The kernel of the former contains a fixed oil and emulsin; while that of the latter has in addition a nitrogenous substance called amygdalin, which, by combination with emulsin, produces a volatile oil and prussic acid. The flowers of the bitter almond-tree (Amygdalus communis, variety amara) are larger and whiter than those of the sweet almond-tree (Amygdalus communis, variety dulcis). The sweet almond is bland and inodorous. There are numerous commercial varieties, of which the most esteemed is the Jordan almond, imported from Malaga. Valentia almonds are also valued. Fresh sweet almonds are nutritive and demulcent, but as the outer brown skin or episperm sometimes causes irritation of the alimentary canal, they are blanched by removal of this skin when used at dessert. When bitter almonds are pounded in water a ratafia odour is produced, on account of the formation of prussic acid. The essential oil or essence of almonds, so much employed for flavouring dishes, requires to be used with caution, as it possesses marked poisonous qualities. In some cases the oil, even when taken in small quantities, produces nettle-rash. The import of sweet almonds into Britain in 1870 amounted to 36,189 cwt.; of bitter almonds, 7618 cwt.
