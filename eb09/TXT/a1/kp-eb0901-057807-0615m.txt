ALL-SAINTS DAY, All-Hallows, or Hallowmas, a festival, first instituted about 610 a.d., on the 1st of May, in memory of the martyrs, and celebrated since 834 on the 1st of November, as a general commemoration of all the saints. As the number of saints increased, it became impossible to dedicate a feast-day to each. Hence it was found expedient to have an annual aggregate commemoration of such as had not special days for themselves. The festival is common to the Roman Catholic, English, and Lutheran churches. See Beltane.
