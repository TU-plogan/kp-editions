ALLEGHANY, Allegheny, or Allegany Mountains, is the name often given to the Appalachian Mountains in the United States. A more exact use of the name restricts it to the portion of the system that lies west of the Hudson river, and forms the watershed of the Mississippi basin on the south-east. See Appalachian Mountains.
