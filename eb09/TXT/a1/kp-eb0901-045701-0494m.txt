ALCAeUS, one of the great lyric poets of Greece, was a native of Mitylene in Lesbos, and flourished about the year 600 b.c. From the fragments of his poems which have come down to us we learn that his life was greatly mixed up with the political disputes and internal feuds of his native city. He sided with the nobles, and took an active part against the tyrants, who at that time set themselves up in Mitylene. He was obliged, in consequence, to quit his native country, and spend the rest of his life in exile. The date of his death is unknown. His poems, which were composed in the Aeolian dialect, were collected afterwards, and apparently divided into ten books. The subjects, as we can still see from the fragments, were of the most varied kind: some of his poems were hymns to the gods; others were of a martial or political character; others again breathed an ardent love of liberty and hatred of the tyrants; and lastly, some were of an erotic kind, and appear to have been particularly remarkable for the fervour of the passion they described. Horace looks upon Alcaeus as his great model, and has, in one passage (Od. ii. 13. 26, et sqq.) given a fine picture of the poetical powers of the Aeolian bard. The care which Alcaeus bestowed upon the construction of his verses was probably the reason why one kind of metre, the Alcaic, was named after him. Not one of his compositions has come down to us entire, but a complete collection of all the extant fragments may be found in Bergkâ€™s Poetae Lyrici Graeci, Lipsiae, 1852, 8vo.
