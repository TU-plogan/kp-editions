ALTDORF, or Altoef, a town in Switzerland, capital of the canton of Uri, situated at the northern end of the pass of St Gotthard, near the lake of Lucerne. It contains the oldest Capuchin monastery in Switzerland, but is otherwise of little interest, except as the place pointed out by tradition where William Tell shot the apple from his son’s head. The lime tree, under which it is alleged the boy stood, has disappeared, but a fountain still marks the spot. There is also an old tower, with rude frescoes commemorating the feat. Bürglen, a village in the neighbourhood, is Tell’s reputed birthplace. Population, 2724.
