AMAGER, or Amak, a small island belonging to Denmark, lying in the Sound, close to the east coast of Seeland. The channel which separates its northern extremity from Seeland forms the harbour of Copenhagen; and nearly the third part of that city, the suburb of Christians-hafen, is situated in Amager. The island is about 9 miles long and 4 broad, with a fertile soil, which produces large quantities of vegetables for the Copenhagen market. It is peopled chiefly by the descendants of a Dutch colony which Christian II. brought there in 1516, who still retain many of the old peculiarities of dress, language, and manners. Population about 9000, exclusive of the inhabitants of Christianshafen. The other towns are Dragoe and Castrup.
