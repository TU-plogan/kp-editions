ADMINISTRATOR, in English Law, he to whom the ordinary or judge of the ecclesiastical court, now the Court of Probate, acting in the queenâ€™s name, commits the administration of the goods of a person deceased, in default of an executor. The origin of administrators is derived from the civil law. Their establishment in England is owing to a statute made in the 31st year of Edward III. Till then no office of this kind was known besides that of executor; in default of whom, the ordinary had the disposal of goods of persons intestate, &c.

Administrator, in Scottish Law, a person legally empowered to act for another whom the law presumes incapable of acting for himself, as a father for a pupil child.
