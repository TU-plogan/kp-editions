ALAMOS, Los, a town of Mexico, in the state of Sinaloa, situated on a barren plain 140 miles N.N.W. of Sinaloa. The houses of the town are mostly of stone or brick covered with stucco, and several of the streets are well paved; provisions are dear and water scarce. The surrounding district contains many rich silver mines. Of the population, amounting to about 10,000, a large proportion are employed in the mines.
