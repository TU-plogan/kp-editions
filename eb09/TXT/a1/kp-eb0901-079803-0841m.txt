ANASTASIUS IL, Emperor, whose original name was Artemius, was raised to the throne of Constantinople by the voice of the senate and people in 713 a.d., on the deposition of Philippicus, whom he had served in the capacity of secretary. His territories, being threatened both by sea and land, he sent an army under Leo the Isaurian, afterwards emperor, to defend Syria; adopted wise and resolute measures for the defence of his capital; and equipped and despatched a formidable naval force, with orders not only to resist the approach of the enemy, but to destroy their naval stores. The fleet mutinied'.· at Rhodes, and proclaimed Theodosius, a person of low extraction, emperor. After a six months’ reign, Constantinople was taken by Theodosius; and Anastasius, who had fled to Nicaea, was compelled to submit to the new emperor, and, retiring to Thessalonica, became a monk (716). In 721 he headed a revolt against Leo, who had succeeded Theodosius, and receiving a considerable amount of support, laid siege to Constantinople; but the enterprise failed, and Anastasius falling into Leo’s hands, was put to death by his orders.
