ALEXANDER of Aphrodisias, the most celebrated of the Greek commentators on the writings of Aristotle, and styled, by way of pre-eminence, ό εξηγητής, the Expositor. He was a native of Aphrodisias in Caria, and taught the Peripatetic philosophy at Athens in the end of the 2d and the beginning of the 3d centuries of the Christian era. Commentaries by Alexander on the following works of Aristotle are still extant:—The Analytica Priora, I.; the Topica; the Meteorologica ; the De Sensu; and the Metaphysica, I.-V., together with an abridgment of what he wrote on the remaining books of the Metaphysica. His commentaries were greatly esteemed among the Arabians, who translated many of them. There are also several original writings by Alexander still extant. The most important of these are a work On Fate, in which he argues against the Stoic doctrine of necessity; and one On the Soul, in which he contends that the undeveloped reason in man is material (voυs υλικόs), and inseparable from the body. He identified the active intellect (νους ποιητικός), through whose agency the potential intellect in man becomes actual, with God. Several of Alexander’s works were published in the Aldine edition of Aristotle, Venice, 1495-98; his Be Fato and De Anima were printed along with the works of The-mistius at Venice, 1534; the former work, which has been translated into Latin by Grotius and also by Schulthess, was edited by Orelli, Zurich, 1824; and his commentaries on the Metaphysica by Bonitz, Berlin, 1847. Nourisson has treated of his doctrine of fate, Paris, 1870.
