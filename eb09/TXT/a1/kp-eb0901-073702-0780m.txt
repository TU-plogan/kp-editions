AMHERST, a post township of Hampshire county, Massachusetts, United States. It is a picturesque village intersected by two branches of the Connecticut river. Its water-power is utilised for manufactories of machinery, edge tools, cotton goods, paper, &c.; but it is principally known as the seat of Amherst college, a valuable institution founded in 1821, mainly for the purpose of educating poor and pious young men for the ministry. The charity fund is large, and pays the tuition fees of forty or fifty students. The faculty of the college consists of eighteen professors, beside the president. The number of students in 1873 was 261. The buildings of Amherst college are situated on a hill at the southern extremity of the village. An octagonal building in advance of the line of college halls is devoted to the purposes of a museum. Some of the collections are of great value, especially those in the palaeontological department. The Massachusetts Agricultural school, founded in 1863, has also its seat at Amherst. Its handsome buildings are on the edge of a rich plain from which fine views are obtained of the mountains on the west and south. There is a large farm for experiment attached to the school, which is esteemed one of the best in America. The population of Amherst in 1870 was 4035.
