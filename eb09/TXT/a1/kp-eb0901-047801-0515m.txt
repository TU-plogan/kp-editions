ALES, or Aless (Alesius), Alexander, a celebrated divine of the school of Augsburg, was born at Edinburgh on the 23d April 1500 (died 1565). His name was originally Alane, and that by which he is more generally known (derived from α λ εε ί vω ) was assumed by him when he went into exile. He studied at St Andrews in the newly-founded college of St Leonards, where he graduated in 1515. Some time afterwards he was appointed a canon of the collegiate church, and in this office he at first contended vigorously for the scholastic theology as against the doctrines of the Reformers. His views were entirely changed, however, on the occasion of the execution of Patrick Hamilton in 1528. He had been chosen to meet Hamilton in controversy, with a view to convincing him of his errors, but the arguments of the Scottish proto-martyr, and above all the spectacle of his intrepid conduct at the stake, impressed Alesius so powerfully that he was entirely won over to the cause of the Reformers, though for a time he did not make the fact known. A sermon which he preached against the dissoluteness of the clergy gave great offence to Prior Hepburn, who cast him into prison, and might have carried his resentment to the extremest limit had not Alesius contrived to escape to the Continent in 1531. After travelling in various countries of northern Europe, he settled down at Wittenberg, where he made the acquaintance of Melancthon, and signed the Augsburg confession. Meanwhile he was tried in Scotland for heresy, and condemned without a hearing. In 1533 a [9:1:479] decree of the Scottish clergy, prohibiting the reading of the New Testament by the laity, drew from Alesius an ably-argued defence of the right of the people, in the form of a letter to James V. A reply to this by John Coch-laeus, also addressed to the Scottish king, occasioned a second letter from Alesius, in which he not only restates and amplifies his argument with great force and beauty of style, but enters at some length into more general questions connected with the Reformation. In 1535, Henry VIII. having broken with the Church of Rome, Alesius was induced to remove to England, where he was very cordially received by the king and his advisers Cranmer and Cromwell. After a short residence at Lambeth he was appointed, through the influence of Cromwell, then chancellor of the university, to lecture on theology at Cambridge; but when he had delivered a few expositions of the Hebrew psalms, he was compelled by the opposition of the papal party to desist. Returning to London, he supported himself for some time by practising as a physician. In 1537 he attended a convocation of the clergy, and at the request of Cromwell, the president, conducted a controversy with Stokesley, bishop of London, on the nature of the sacraments. His argument, which was marked by great ability, was afterwards published at Leipsic. In 1539 Alesius was compelled to flee for the second time to Germany, in consequence of the enactment of the persecuting statute known as the Six Articles. He was immediately chosen to fill a theological chair in the university of Frankfort-on-the-Oder, where he was the first professor who taught the Reformed doctrines. In 1543 he quitted Frankfort for a similar position at Leipsic, his contention that it was the duty of the civil magistrate to punish fornication having given offence to some of the authorities of the former university. At Leipsic Alesius remained until his death, which occurred on the 17th March 1565. He enjoyed the intimate friendship of Melancthon, to whom he rendered valuable assistance in many of his disputations with the Catholic doctors.

Alesius was the author of a large number of exegetical, dogmatic, and polemical works. He displayed his warm interest in his native land by the publication (1544) of a Cohortatio ad Concordiam Pietatis, missa in Patriam suam, which had the express approval of Luther. In 1560 appeared his treatise, De Necessitate et Merito Bonorum Operum, a valuable contribution to the synergistic side in the controversy on good works.
