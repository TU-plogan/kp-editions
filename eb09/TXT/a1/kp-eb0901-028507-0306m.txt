AGOSTINO, Paolo, an eminent Italian musician, born at Valerano in 1593. He studied under Nanini, and succeeded Ugolini as conductor of the Pope’s orchestra in St Peter’s. His musical compositions are numerous and of great merit, an Agnus Dei for eight voices being specially admired. He died in 1629.
