ALDEBURGH, or Aldborough, a market-town and watering-place in the county of Suffolk, 25 miles E.N.E. of Ipswich. The borough was incorporated by a charter of King Edward VI., and in former times was a place of considerable extent; but the old town was gradually submerged by the encroachments of the sea. Further destruction is now stayed by the accumulated sandbanks, and the place has become a favourite resort of summer visitors. Fishing affords employment to many of the inhabitants. The town is noted as the birthplace of the poet Crabbe, who was born here on 24th December 1754. A marble bust of the poet has been placed in the parish church. Aldeburgh was formerly a parliamentary borough, but was disfranchised by the Reform Act of 1832. Population of the parish in 1871, 1990.
