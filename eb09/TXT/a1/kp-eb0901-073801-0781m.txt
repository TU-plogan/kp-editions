AMHURST, Nicholas, an English poet and political writer of the 18th century, was born at Marden in Kent, and entered (1716) at St John’s college, Oxford, from which he was expelled, ostensibly for libertinism and irregular conduct, but really, according to his own statement, on account of the liberality of his opinions. Retaining great resentment against the university on this account, he gave expression to his feeling in a poem published in 1724, called Oculus Britannice, and in a book entitled Terroe Filius. He published a Miscellany of Poems, sacred and profane; and The Convocation, a poem in five cantos, which was a satire on the bishop of Bangor’s antagonists. But he is best known for the share he had in the political paper called The Craftsman, which he conducted for several years. It attained a circulation of 10,000 or 12,000 copies, and had very considerable influence in inflaming popular opinion against Sir Robert Walpole, and in bringing about the political change of 1742. Amhurst’s party made no provision for him, however, on their accession to power, and their neglect is supposed to have hastened his death, which occurred at Twickenham on the 27th April 1742.
