AMASIA, or Amasiayah, a town in Anatolia, Turkey, situated on both sides of the Yeshil-Irmak, or Iris, in a narrow gorge about 80 miles from the mouth of the river. The houses being ill-built and the streets narrow, the town would have a mean appearance but for its situation and the splendid remains of antiquity in its neighbourhood. The most remarkable of these are the Acropolis, which is built on a lofty rock overhanging the town; the tombs of the kings of Pontus, described by Strabo the geographer, a native of Amasia; and a handsome mosque, erected in 1490 by the Sultan Bajazet II. The chief productions of Amasia and the surrounding districts are silk, salt, wheat, wine, and cotton. Population of the town, 25,000.
