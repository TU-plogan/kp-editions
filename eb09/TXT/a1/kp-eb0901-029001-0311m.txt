AGRICOLA, ChristopÏ€ Ludwig, landscape-painter, was born at Regensburg on the 5th Nov. 1667, and died at the same place in 1719. He spent a great part of his life in travel, visiting England, Holland, and France, and residing for a considerable period at Naples. His numerous landscapes, chiefly cabinet pictures, are remarkable for fidelity to nature, and especially for their skilful representation of varied phases of climate. In composition his style shows the influence of Caspar Poussin, while in light and colour he imitates Claude Lorraine. His pictures are to be found in Dresden, Brunswick, Vienna, Florence, Naples, and many other towns of both Germany and Italy.
