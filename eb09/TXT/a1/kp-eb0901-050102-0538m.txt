ALEXIUS I., the nephew of Isaac Comnenus, and the most distinguished member of the Comnenus family, was born in 1048, and died in 1118. In early life he signalised himself in the wars against the enemies of his country; but the mean jealousies of the ministers of the emperor Nicephorus (surnamed Botaniates) drove him to take up arms against a sovereign whose cause he had thrice gallantly defended against powerful insurgent leaders; and he ascended the throne of Constantinople in 1081. His character has been too partially drawn by his favourite daughter, Anna Comnena, who has, however, justly remarked that the disorders of the times were both the misfortune and glory of Alexius, and that he paid the penalty for the vices of his predecessors. In his reign the Turks extended their conquests from Persia to the Hellespont; on the north the empire was assailed by hordes of barbarians from the Danube, and on the west by the Normans; while Europe pressed on Asia by way of Constantinople, in the excitement of the first crusade. Amid these disturbances Alexius managed the affairs of the state with a dexterous and courageous hand, though his policy was ascribed by the Latins to cowardice or treachery. He was politic enough to derive solid advantages from the romantic valour of the crusaders. Alexius outlived the love of his subjects, and their patience was all but exhausted in the latter part of his long reign. The nobility were irritated by the extravagance of his relations; the people by his severity and exactions; and the clergy murmured at his appropriation of the church funds to the defence of the state.
