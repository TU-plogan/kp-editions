ALCUDIA, Manuel de Godoy, Duke of, “Prince of the Peace,” Spanish statesman, was born of poor but noble parentage at Badajoz on the 12th May 1767 (died 1851). In 1784 he came to Madrid to join the royal bodyguard, and by his handsome presence and agreeable manners soon attracted notice. The queen regarded him with great favour, and the weak-minded Charles IV. raised him rapidly from dignity to dignity, until in 1792, on the disgrace of Aranda, he became prime minister. One of the first steps he took on his accession to power was to declare war against the French convention. Though success at first attended the Spanish arms, the position of matters was reversed in a second campaign, and the war was concluded by the treaty of Basle, signed on the 22d July 1795, for negotiating which Godoy received his title of Prince of the Peace and a large landed estate. He was also made at the same time a grandee of Spain of the first class. In 1796 he formed an offensive and defensive alliance with the French republic, which involved Spain in a war with England. Next year he was married to Maria Theresa de Bourbon, niece of the king by a morganatic marriage of his brother Luis. As it was understood that Godoy had already married Dona Josef a Tudo, this second alliance, though it brought him nearer to the king, did much to increase his unpopularity with the nation. On the 28th March 1798 he found himself forced to resign his position in the ministry, but he never lost the favour of the king, who appointed him grand admiral in 1799. About the same time he was restored to power, and entered into an alliance with Napoleon, having for its object the partition of Portugal· The war, in which Godoy himself commanded, was of short duration, the treaty of Badajoz, signed on the 6th June 1801, securing from Portugal a subsidy to France and a cession of territory to Spain. Godoy was rewarded for his service with the title of Count of Evoramente, and an annual income of 100,000 piastres. In 1804 he became generalissimo of the land and sea forces of Spain; but the honours thus heaped upon him by the king were accompanied by growing dislike on the part of the nobility and the people. The higher classes regarded him with jealousy as a parvenu, and he was necessarily unpopular with a nation that attributed to him the defeat of Trafalgar, and the stoppage of its commerce through the blockade of the ports. A change of policy, by which he endeavoured to break off his alliance with France and enter into friendly relations with England, came too late to save his position. Napoleon determined to remove the Bourbons from the throne of Spain, and the invasion of the French troops gave Godoy’s enemies the wished-for opportunity to secure his downfall. The prime minister had retired from Madrid, and was making arrangements for the removal of the king and queen to Mexico, when the project was discovered by the Prince of Asturias, the leader of the party opposed to him. On the 18th March 1808 Godoy was seized at Aranjuez by the mob, who were only restrained from executing summary vengeance upon him by the promise given them that he should undergo a fair trial. Napoleon, however, wishing to avail himself of his influence over Charles, sent Prince Murat to effect his release. He was removed in April to Bayonne, where on the 5th May he signed the deed by which Charles IV. abdicated in favour of the Prince of Asturias. He continued to enjoy the undiminished favour of Charles, whom he accompanied to Rome, his possessions in Spain having been confiscated. On the death of his royal master he removed to Paris, where he received a pension of 5000 francs from Louis Philippe. In 1836-8 he published memoirs of his life, in which he defends his policy. In 1847 his titles and the greater part of his estates were restored to him, and he received permission to return to Spain. He continued, however, to reside in Paris, where he died on the 4th October 1851.
