AMPHITRITE, in Greek Mythology, the supreme goddess of the sea, and as such the wife of Poseidon (Neptune), but, unlike him, so entirely confined in her authority to the sea and the creatures in it, that not only was her name (from άμφί-τρίω, the same root as τpυω) sometimes used as an equivalent for that element, but she was never associated with her husband either for purposes of worship or in works of art, except when he was to be distinctly regarded as the god who controlled the sea, though generally his functions extended to the whole watery element. She was one of the nereids, and distinguishable from the others only by her queenly attributes. It was said that Neptune saw her first dancing at Naxus among the other nereids, and carried her off. But in another version of the myth, she then fled from him to the farthest ends of the sea, where the dolphin of Neptune found her out. In works of art she is represented either enthroned beside him, or driving with him in a chariot drawn by hippocamps or other fabulous creatures of the deep, and attended by tritons and nereids.
