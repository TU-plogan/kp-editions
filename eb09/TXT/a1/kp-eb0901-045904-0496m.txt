ALCESTIS, or Alceste, the daughter of Pelias and Anaxibia, and wife of Admetus, king of Pherae in Thessaly. She consented to die in place of her husband, and was afterwards restored to life by Hercules. This beautiful instance of conjugal devotion forms the subject of one of the best plays of Euripides, the Alcestis, which furnishes the basis for Robert Browningâ€™s Balaustion's Adventure.
