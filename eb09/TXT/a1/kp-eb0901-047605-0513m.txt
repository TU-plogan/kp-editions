ALEMAN, Louis, Archbishop of Arles, and Cardinal of St Cecilia, was born at Bugey in 1390. He was one of the presidents of the Council of Basle in 1431, and led the party that maintained the supremacy of councils over popes in opposition to the claims of Eugenius IV. It was on his motion that the latter was deposed by the council, and Felix V. elected in his stead. Eugenius thereupon deposed the arch-pope, and deprived Aleman of all his ecclesiastical dignities, but these were restored by Nicholas V. in 1447, Felix V. having previously resigned, on the advice of the cardinal. In 1527 Aleman was canonised by Popo Clement VII.
