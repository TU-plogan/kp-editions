AMSDORF, Nicolavs, a Protestant reformer of the 16th century, was born, Dec. 3, 1483, at Gross-Zschopa, near Wurzen, on the Mulde. He was educated at Leipsic, and then at Wittenberg, where ho was one of the first who matriculated (1502) in the recently-founded university. He soon obtained various academical honours, and became [9:1:779] professor of theology in 1511. He joined Luther at the very beginning of his great struggle (1517); continued all along one of his most admiring and determined supporters; was with him at the Leipsic conference (1519), and the Diet of Worms (1521); and was in the secret of his Wartburg seclusion. He assisted the first efforts of the Reformation at Magdeburg (1524), at Goslar (1531), and at Einbeck (1534); took an active part in the debates at Schmalkald (1537), where he defended the use of the sacrament by the unbelieving; and (1539) spoke out strongly against the bigamy of the Elector of Hesse. After the death of the Count Palatine, bishop of Naumburg-Zeiz, he was installed there (Jan. 20, 1542), though in opposition to the chapter, by the elector of Saxony and Luther. His position was a painful one, and he longed to get back to Magdeburg, but was persuaded by Luther to stay. After Luther’s death (1546) and the battle of Mühlberg (1547) he had to yield to his rival Pfiug, and retire to the protection of the young duke of Weimar. Here he took part in founding Jena university (1548); opposed the “Augsburg Interim” (1548); superintended the publication of the Jena edition of Luther’s works;- and debated on the freedom of the will, original sin, and, more noticeably, on the Christian value of good works, in regard to which he held that they were not only useless, but prejudicial. He urged the separation of the High Lutheran party from Melanchthon (1557), got the Saxon dukes to oppose the Frankfurt Recess (1558), and continued to fight for the purity of Lutheran doctrine. He died at Eisenach, May 14,1565, and was buried in the high church there, where his effigy shows a well-knit frame and sharpcut features. He was a man of strong will, of great aptitude for controversy, and considerable learning, and thus exercised a decided influence on the Reformation. Many letters and other short productions of his pen are extant in MS., especially five thick volumes of Amsdorfiana, in the Weimar library. A small sect, which adopted his opinion on good works, was called after him; but it is now of mere historical interest.
