ALCALDE (from the Arabic al-cadi, the judge), an official title given in Spain to various classes of functionaries entrusted with judicial duties. Criminal judges, members of courts of appeal, magistrates, and even parish officers are all known by the name alcaldeâ€”secondary descriptive titles distinguishing their different positions and functions. It is to be observed that the word is entirely distinct from Alcaide, the latter being always employed to designate a military officer.
