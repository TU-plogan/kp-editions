ALESSI, Galeazzo (1500-72), a distinguished architect, born at Perugia, was a pupil of Caporali and a friend of Michael Angelo. He was an enthusiastic student of ancient architecture, and his style gained for him a European reputation. Genoa is indebted to him for a number of its most magnificent palaces, and specimens of his skill may be seen in the churches of San-Paolo and San-Vittoria at Milan, in certain parts of the Escurial, and in numerous churches and palaces throughout Sicily, Flanders, and Germany.
