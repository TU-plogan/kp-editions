AMMONIA (NH 3 ), sometimes called the Volatile alkali, or Alkaline air, was known to the alchemists in aqueous solution. Priestley first separated it in the gaseous state in 1774. Scheele in 1777 discovered that it contained nitrogen, and its true composition was ascertained by Berthollet about 1785. Ammonia occurs in the atmosphere as carbonate and nitrate, in sea-water, and in many mineral springs. Iron ores and many clayey soils contain it in small quantity, and sal-ammoniac and â€¢ammonia alum are found as minerals in volcanic districts. Carbonate of ammonia is obtained in large quantity by the putrefaction of the urine of animals, or the dry distillation of animal matter. Ammonia is obtained from its salts by the acting of slaked lime or solutions of potash or soda, and is freed from water by passing over quicklime or solid potash, and finally collected over mercury. It is a colourless gas, of a pungent smell, and alkaline taste and reaction. It does not support combustion or respiration, and is feebly combustible. It is remarkably soluble in water, 1 volume dissolving nearly 700 of the gas. It may by the action of a low temperature and great pressure be changed into the liquid or solid state. The gas is easily decomposed into its elements by a succession of electric sparks, or by passing it over red-hot iron or platinum wire. The aqueous solution in presence of finely divided platinum and atmospheric air is converted into nitrite of ammonia; and conversely, the oxides of nitrogen, mixed with excess of hydrogen and passed over platinised asbestos, are changed into ammonia. Nitrogen and hydrogen have not by any process been induced to combine so as to yield this compound directly, unless in very small quantity. For theoretical relations of ammonia, salts, <fcc., see Chemistry.
