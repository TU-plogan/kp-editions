ALDERMAN, a word derived from the Anglo-Saxon ealdorman, compounded of the comparative degree of the adjective eald (old) and man. The term implies the possession of an office of rank or dignity; and among the Anglo-Saxons, earls, governors of provinces, and other persons of distinction received this title. Thus we read [9:1:473] of the aldermannus totius Anglioe, who seems to have corresponded to the officer afterwards styled capitalis justi-ciarius Angliae, or chief justice of England; the aldermannus regis, probably an occasional magistrate, answering to our justice of assize, or perhaps an officer whose duty it was to prosecute for the crown; and aldermannus comitatus, a magistrate with a middle rank between what was afterwards called the earl and the sheriff, who sat at the trial of causes with the bishop, and declared the common law, while the bishop proceeded according to ecclesiastical law. Besides these, we meet with the titles of aldermannus civitatis, burgi, castelli, hundredi sive wapentachii, &c. In modern times aldermen are office-bearers in the muncipal corporations of England and Wales, and Ireland. Before the passing of the Municipal Corporation Act their functions varied according to the charters of the different burghs. By the statute 5th and 6th Will. IV. c. 76, and 3d and 4th Vict. c. 118, the aldermen are elected by the councillors from among themselves (in Ireland, by the burgesses), for six years, one-half going out every three years. The number of councillors in each borough varies from 12 to 48, according to its magnitude. One-fourth of the municipal council consists of alderman, and three-fourths of councillors. In the municipal corporations of Scotland there is no such title as alderman, the office-bearers of corresponding rank there being termed bailies. The corporation of London was not included in the Burgh Reform Act, and the antiquated system remains there in full force. The Court of Aidermen consists of twenty-six, twenty-five of whom are elected for life by the freemen of the respective wards, who return two persons, one of whom the Court of Aidermen elect to supply the vacancy. The city is divided into twenty-six wards; twenty-four of these send up one alderman each, the other two combine to choose a twenty-fifth. The twenty-sixth alderman serves for the independent borough of Southwark, and is appointed by the other aidermen, who generally select the senior from among themselves when a vacancy occurs. The lord mayor is elected from such of the aidermen as have served the office of sheriff; of these the Common Hall, which consists of the freemen of the different wards, select two, and the aidermen elect one of these to the mayoralty. The Court of Aidermen act as magistrates for the city of London, and also possess authority of a judicial nature in the affairs of the corporation. The aidermen are members of the Court of Common Council, the legislative body of the corporation, which consists in all of 232 members, the remainder being elected annually by the freemen. In the United States aidermen form as a rule a legislative rather than a judicial body, although in some cities they hold courts and possess very considerable magisterial powers.
