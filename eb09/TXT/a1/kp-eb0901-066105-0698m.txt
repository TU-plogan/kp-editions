AMBOISE, a town situated in a rich wine-producing district in the department of Indre-et-Loire, France, on the left bank of the Loire, 14 miles east of Tours. Its chief manufactures are cloth and files. At Amboise the French Protestants were first called Huguenots, and 1200 of them were massacred there in 1560 on the discovery of their conspiracy against the Guises. The ancient castle, which is situated on a height above the town, was a seat of the French kings, and it was set apart as a residence for the Arab chief Abd-el-Kader during his captivity in France. Population, 4570.
