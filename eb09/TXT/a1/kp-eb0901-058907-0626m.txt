ALMALI, a prosperous town of Asiatic Turkey, situated' on the river Myra, 25 miles from its mouth, and 50 miles W.S.W. of Adalia. It lies 5000 feet above the sea, in a valley at the extremity of an extensive plain, the neighbouring mountains rising to a height of 10,000 feet. The town is well built, with handsome houses, several mosques, and a bazaar; and its appearance is rendered very attractive by the lofty trees interspersed through the streets, and by the gardens of the environs. There are numerous mills and factories, tanyards and dyeworks; and the inhabitants are exceedingly industrious. The town is much frequented by merchants from Smyrna and other places, who purchase the produce of the district and send it to the coast for shipment. Population, 8000.
