ALEXANDER JAROSLAWITZ NEVSKI, Saint, Grand Duke of Wladimir, second son of the Grand Duke Jaroslaw II., was born at Wladimir in 1219, and died 14th November 1263. He became prince of Novgorod on the resignation of his father in 1239, his elder brother having died. While Batu Khan was sweeping with his Tatars over the south, the Swedes, Danes, and Livonian knights took advantage of this to oppress the north of Russia; Alexander accordingly directed his arms against them, and gained a brilliant victory with his small army on the 15th July 1240. His surname of Nevski was derived from this event, which took place near the Neva, and in the vicinity of the modern St Petersburg. In a second campaign in 1241 he was no less successful, and drove his enemies out of Pleskow in Kiew. In a third campaign he defeated them near lake Peipus (1242), and forced the Livonian knights to sue for peace and retire from the district of Pskow, which they had conquered a short time before. On his fatherâ€™s death in 1247, a younger brother (Andrew) opposed Alexander, and seized the duchy of Wladimir; but in 1251 the latter was established in his rights by the khan of Kaptchak, the district which the Mongolian Batu had taken under his immediate authority. He firmly opposed the proposal of Pope Innocent IV. to unite the Greek with the Roman church. He died at Gorodetz, 14th November 1263, on his return from a visit to Kassimcow. Towards the close of his life he is said to have taken holy orders, but the tradition rests on no sure basis. At his death the people universally spoke of him as their father and protector, and afterwards recorded his deeds in their songs, and honoured him as a saint. Peter the Great, when founding St Petersburg, erected a magnificent monastery to the east of the city in honour of the victory won there by his great predecessor, and created in 1722 one of the eight Russian orders, that of Alexander Nevski. The monastery is now one of the wealthiest in Russia, and has, according to Eckhardt, a yearly revenue of half a million silver roubles.
