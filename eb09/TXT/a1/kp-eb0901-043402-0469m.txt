AKABAH, The Gulf of, the Sinus Elanites of antiquity, is the eastmost of the two divisions into which the Red Sea bifurcates near its northern extremity. It penetrates into Arabia Petraea in a N.N.E. direction, from 28° to 29° 32' N. lat., a distance of 100 miles, and its breadth varies from 12 to 17 miles. The entrance is contracted by Tiran and other islands, so that the passage is rendered somewhat difficult; and its navigation is dangerous on account of the numerous coral reefs, and the sudden squalls which sweep down from the adjacent mountains, many of which rise perpendicularly to a height of 2000 feet. The only well-sheltered harbour is that called the Golden Port, situated on its western shore about 33 miles from the entrance, and 29 miles E. of Mount Sinai. About 2½ miles from the head of the gulf is the village of Akabah, with a fortified castle, garrisoned by a few soldiers for the protection of the Moslem pilgrims on their way to Mecca. In the vicinity of the village there are extensive date groves; and there is abundance of good water, fruit, and vegetables. Akabah, though now of small importance, is not devoid of historical interest. It is supposed to occupy the site of the Elath of Scripture, which in remote ages carried on an extensive commerce; and some ruins in the sea a short distance southward are surmised to be the remains of Eziongeber.
