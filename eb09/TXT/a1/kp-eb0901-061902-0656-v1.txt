ALPINI, Prospero (in Latin Prosper Alpinus), a celebrated physician and botanist, was born at Marostica, in the republic of Venice, on the 23d November 1553. In his youth he served for a time in the Milanese army, but in 1574 he quitted it, and went to Padua to study medicine. He was admitted to the degree of doctor of physic in 1578, soon after which he left the University, and settled as a physician in Campo San Pietro, a small town in the Paduan territory, at the invitation of its citizens. In the course of his studies he had paid particular attention to botanical science; but the sphere of his present practice was too limited to afford him much opportunity of prosecuting his favourite study. He wished particularly to extend his knowledge of exotic plants, by observing their economy and habits in their native soil. To gratify this laudable curiosity an opportunity presented itself when George Emo or Hemi, the consul for the Venetian republic in Egypt, appointed Alpini his physician. They sailed from Venice in September 1580, and arrived at Grand Cairo in the following year. Alpini spent three years in Egypt, and by his industry and assiduity greatly improved his ‘botanical knowledge, having travelled along the banks of the Nile, visited every place, and consulted every person from whom he expected any new information. From a practice in the management of date-trees which he observed in this country, Alpini seems to have deduced the doctrine of the sexual difference of plants, which was adopted as the foundation of the celebrated system of Linnaeus. He says that “the female date-trees or palms do not bear fruit unless the branches of the male and female plants are mixed together; or, as is generally done, unless the dust found in the male sheath or male flowers is sprinkled over the female flowers.” His treatise De Medicina Aegyptiorum contains the first account of the coffee-plant that was published in Europe. When Alpini returned to Venice in 1586 he was appointed physician to Andre Doria, prince of Melfi; and during his residence at Genoa he was esteemed the first physician of his age. The Venetians were unwilling that the Genoese state should number among its citizens a person of such distinguished merit and reputation; and in the year 1593 he was recalled to fill the botanical chair in the university of Padua, with a salary of 200 florins, afterwards increased to 750. He discharged the duties of his professorship for many years with great reputation, till his declining health interrupted his labours. He died of slow fever on the 6th February 1617, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, and was succeeded as botanical professor by one of his sons. The genus Alpinia, belonging to the order Zingiberaceae, is named after him. Alpini wrote the following works in Latin:—1. De Medicina Aegyptiorum Libri iv., Venice, 1591, 4to; 2. De Plantis Aegypti Liber, Venice, 1592, 4to; 3. De Balsamo Dialogus, Venice, 1592, 4to; 4. De Praesagienda Vita et Morte Aegrotantium Libri vii., Venice, 1601, 4to; 5. De Medicina Methodica Libri xiii., Padua, 1611, folio; 6. De Rhapontico Disputatio, Padua, 1612, 4to. Of all these works various editions have appeared; and besides these, two posthumous treatises were published by his son— 1. De Plantis Exoticis Libri ii., Venice, 1627, 4to; 2. Historice Naturalis Egypti Libri iv., Lugd. Bat. 1635, 4to. Several other works of Alpini remain in manuscript.
