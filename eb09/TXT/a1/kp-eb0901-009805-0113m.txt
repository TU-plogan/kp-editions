ACOLYTE (from ακόλουθος, an attendant), one of a minor order of clergy in the ancient church, ranking next to the sub-deacon. We learn from the canons of the fourth Council of Carthage that the archdeacon, at their ordination, put into their hands a candlestick with a taper and an empty pitcher, to imply that they were appointed to light the candles of the church and to furnish wine for the eucharist. Their dress was the cassock and surplice. The name and office still exist in the church.
