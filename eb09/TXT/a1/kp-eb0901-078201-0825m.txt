AMURATH III., sultan of the Turks, born about 1545, succeeded in 1574 his father Selim II. The first words he addressed to his courtiers were—“I am hungry: give me something to eat;” and the evil omen was fulfilled in the famines and disasters that marked his reign. In 1579 Queen Elizabeth of England managed to gain his friendship, and obtained a favourable commercial treaty for Great Britain. It was under him that the janissaries began to feel their power, and to hasten the ruin of the state by their revolt. He was superstitious, feeble, and irritable, as well as extremely addicted to the pleasures of the harem. He was fond of dancing and music, and has left a few literary trifles. He died Jan. 16, 1595.
