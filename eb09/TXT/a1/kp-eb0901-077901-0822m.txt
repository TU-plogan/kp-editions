AMSLER, Samuel, one of the most distinguished of modern engravers, was born at Schinznach, in the canton of Aargau, in 1791. He studied his art under Lips and Hess, and from 1816 pursued it in Italy, and chiefly at Rome, till in 1829 he succeeded his former master Hess as professor of copper engraving in the Munich academy. The works he designed and engraved are remarkable for the grace of the figures, and for the wonderful skill with which he retains and expresses the characteristics of the original paintings and statues. He was a passionate admirer of Raphael, and had great success in reproducing his works. Amsler’s principal engravings are—“The Triumphal March of Alexander the Great,” and a full-length “Christ,” after the sculptures of Thorwaldsen and Dannecker; the “Burial of Christ,” and two “Madonnas,” after the pictures of Raphael; and the “Triumph of Religion in the Arts,” after Overbeck, his last work, on which he spent six years. He died May 18, 1849.
