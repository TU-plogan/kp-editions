ALWAR, a semi-independent state of Rájputáná, and under the control of the Governor-General’s agent for Rájputáná, lies between 28° 13' 25" and 27° 14' 34" N. lat., and between 77° 15' 35" and 76° 14' 10" E. long. It is bounded on the E. by the state of Bhartpur and the British district of Gurgáon, on the N. by Gurgáon district and the states of Patiálá and Nábhá, on the W. by the states of Nábhá and Jaipur, and on the S. by the states of Jaipur and Bhartpur. Its configuration is irregular, the greatest length from north to south being about 80 miles, and breadth from east to west about 60 miles, with a total area of about 3000 square miles. The total population of the state, as ascertained by a census taken in 1872, was 778,596, consisting of 598,333 Hindus, 180,225 Mahometans, and 38 Christians. The number of males was returned at 418,723, and females at 359,873, the proportion of males to the total population being 53 ∙ 76 per cent. The eastern portion of the state is open and highly cultivated; the western is diversified by hills and peaks, which form a continuation of the Aravallí range, from 12 to 20 miles in breadth. These hills run in rocky and precipitous parallel ridges, in some places upwards of 2200 feet in height. The Sabhí river flows through the north-western part of the state, the only other stream of importance being the Ruparel, which rises in the Alwar hills, and flows through the state into the Bhartpur territory.

The one attempt at road-making in the state is a line which connects the chief town, Alwar, with Rájghar on the one side and with Tijará on the other. The greater portion of this road was metalled during the minority of the present rájá, but it has been neglected since he took the management of the state into his own hands, and is now said to be almost impassable, and worse than the ordinary cart tracks. The earthwork for a road from Alwar to the Bhartpur border was thrown up, but it has never been metalled, and the line is not used for traffic. The Alwar hills are rich in minerals. Iron ore is found in large quantities close to the surface. Thirty smelting furnaces are kept at work, and are capable of turning out 390 tons a-year. They give employment to a large number of people. Two copper mines have been in operation for a number of years, but with doubtful advantage to the state. Silver, lead, and sulphur are also found in small quantities, and attempts have been made to work them, but without success. The principal agricultural products are wheat and barley during the cold weather, with grain to a less extent. Joár, bajrá, and Indian corn are raised during the rains. Cotton is extensively cultivated, and exported on a considerable scale. A ten years’ land settlement, which was formed by a late political resident, is now expiring, and a fresh settlement for a longer term is being made. The revenue of the state has for some time been in an unsatisfactory state. When the rájá attained his majority, and was invested with the full administration of his territory in 1863, the treasury contained a surplus of £205,000. Within seven years this surplus had dwindled away, and debts to the extent of £160,000 accumulated. Under these circumstances, the government found it necessary to place the administration of the state in the hands of the political resident, assisted by a council of management consisting of five of the principal chiefs and native gentlemen of the state. In 1870-71, the first year under the new management, the revenue of the state amounted to £213,085, and the expenditure to £135,201, leaving a surplus of £77,884, part of which was devoted to the liquidation of the state debt, the remainder being kept as a working balance. An allowance of £18,000 a-year is made for the household expenses of the rájá, besides an establishment of horses, carriages, and elephants maintained for his use. The educational institutions consist of a high school, attended in 1871-72 by 382 students; a Thákur school, for the education of the sons of chiefs and native gentlemen, and attended by 51 pupils; and sixty other schools, containing a total of 2785 pupils. Seven towns in the state are returned as containing a population of upwards of 5000 souls—namely, Alwar, 52,357; Rájghar, 12,070; Tijará, 7382; Govindgarh, 5720; Rámgarh, 5581; Rámpur, 5381; and Bahror, 5213. The only municipality is the town of Alwar. It derives its municipal revenue from a tax of 1 per cent. on the supposed income of the owners of houses. This tax yields about £800 per annum, out of which, with some assistance from the state, the city police, conservancy establishment, &c., are paid.
