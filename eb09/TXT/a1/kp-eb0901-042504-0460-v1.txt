AIKIN, John, M.D. (1747-1822), was born at Kibworth-Harcourt, received his elementary education at the dissenting academy of Warrington, where his father was tutor, and prosecuted his medical studies in the university of Edinburgh, and in London under the celebrated Dr William Hunter. He commenced his professional career as a surgeon at Chester; but being unsuccessful, he removed to Warrington. Finally, he went to Leyden, took the degree of M.D. in that university (1780), and attempted to establish himself as a physician in London. His success in this new field does not seem to have been considerable; chiefly, no doubt, because he concerned himself more with the advocacy of liberty of conscience than with his professional duties. He therefore began at an early period to devote himself to literary pursuits. Dr Aikin’s reputation chiefly rests on his endeavour to popularise scientific inquiries. In conjunction with his sister, Mrs Barbauld, he commenced the publication of a series of volumes on this principle, entitled Evenings at Home (6 vols., 1792-5), a popular and interesting work, chiefly commendable for the purity of the principles it inculcates, and the pleasing views it gives of human nature. It has been translated into almost every European language. His love of nature, and his power in delineating its features, are well illustrated in The Natural History of the Year, as well as in his miscellaneous Essays. In 1798 Dr Aikin retired from professional life, and devoted himself with great industry to literary undertakings of numerous and varied kinds, among which his valuable Biographical Dictionary (10 vols. 1799-1815) holds a conspicuous place. Besides these, he published Biog. Memoirs of Medicine (1780); Lives of John Selden and Archbishop Usher; Memoirs of Huet, Bishop of Avranches; Geographical Delineations of All Nations, &c. He edited the Monthly Magazine from 1796 to 1807, and. started the Athenaeum in 1807. The latter was discontinued, however, in 1809.
