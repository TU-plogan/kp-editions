ALMONER, in its primitive sense, denotes an officer in religious houses, to whom belonged the management and distribution of the alms of the house. By the ancient canons, all monasteries were to spend at least a tenth part of their income in alms to the poor, and all bishops were required to keep almoners.

Lord Almoner, or Lord High Almoner of England, is an ecclesiastical officer, generally a bishop, who has a right to the forfeiture of all deodands and the goods of a felo de se, which he is to distribute among the poor. He has also, by virtue of an ancient custom, the power of giving the first dish from the kingâ€™s table to whatever poor person he pleases, or, instead of it, an alms in money. See Maunday Thursday.
