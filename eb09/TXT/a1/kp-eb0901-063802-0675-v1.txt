ALSTROEMER, Jonas, a Swedish industrial reformer, was bom at Alingsaes, in West Gothland, on the 7th Jan. 1685. He left his native village at an early age, and in 1707 became clerk to Alberg, a merchant of Stockholm, whom he accompanied to London. After carrying on business for three years, Alberg failed, and Alström (as the clerk then called himself) engaged in the business of shipbroker on his own account, which eventually proved very successful. After travelling for several years on the Continent, he was seized with the patriotic desire to transplant to his native country some of the industries he had seen flourishing in Britain. He accordingly returned to Alingsaes, and in 1724 established a woollen factory in the village, which after preliminary difficulties was completely successful. He next established a sugar refinery at Gothenburg; introduced improvements in the cultivation of potatoes and of plants suitable for dyeing; and directed attention to improved methods in shipbuilding, tanning, and the manufacture of cutlery. But his most successful undertaking was the importation of sheep from England, Spain, and Angora. In return for his services he received many marks of distinction. He was created (1748) knight of the order of the North Star; and a few years later received letters of nobility, with permission to change his name to Aiströmer. He died June 2, 1761, leaving several works on practical industrial subjects. A statue was erected to his honour in the exchange at Stockholm. One of his sons, Clas (i.e., Claude), was a naturalist of considerable eminence.
