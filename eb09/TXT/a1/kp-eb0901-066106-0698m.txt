AMBOYNA, one of the Moluccas or Spice Islands, belonging to the Dutch, lying south-west of Ceram, in 3° 41' S. lat. and 128° 10' E. long. It is 32 miles in length, with an area of about 280 square miles, and is of very irregular figure, being almost divided into two. The southeastern and smaller portion (called Leitimor) is united to the northern (known as Hitoe) by a neck of land about a mile broad. The island is mountainous, but is for the most part fertile and well-watered. Large tracts are covered with rich tropical forests, which embrace a great variety of trees, although ordinary building timber is scarce. The climate is comparatively pleasant and healthy; the average temperature is 80° Fahr., rarely sinking below 72°. The rainfall, however, after the eastern monsoons, is very heavy, and the island is liable to violent hurricanes and earthquakes. Amboyna produces most of the common tropical fruits and vegetables, including the sago-palm, bread-fruit, cocoa-nut, sugar-cane, maize, coffee, pepper, and cotton. Cloves, however, form its chief product, and the only one that is of any real commercial importance. The Dutch have done much to foster the cultivation of this article in the island, and at one time prohibited the rearing of the clove-tree in all the other islands subject to their rule, in order to secure the monopoly to Amboyna. Each tree yields annually from 2 to 5 lb of cloves, and sometimes even more; while the total annual quantity produced probably averages about 500,000 lb. The animal kingdom is poorly represented. Indigenous mammals are feeble in species as well as few in number; birds are more abundant, but of no greater variety. The entomology of the island is, however, very rich, particularly among the Lepi-doptera. The aborigines of Amboyna are a race called Horaforas, but Malays constitute the main body of the population; there are also Chinese, Dutch, and a few Portuguese. The Malays in most points resemble those of Java. They are naturally lazy and effeminate, but when properly trained make good soldiers. The inhabitants are mostly Christians or Mahometans. Amboyna is the chief island of the Dutch residence of the Moluccas, which comprises, in addition, the islands of Boeroe, Amblauw, Ceram, Manipa, Kilang, Bonoe, Haroekoe, Honimoa or Saparoa, Noesa-laut, and Hila. The Portuguese were the first European nation to visit Amboyna (1512). They established a factory there in 1521, but did not obtain peaceable possession of it till 1580, and were dispossessed by the Dutch in 1605. About the year 1615 the British formed a settlement in the island, at Cambello, which they retained until 1623, when it was destroyed by the Dutch, and frightful tortures inflicted on the unfortunate persons connected with it. In 1654, after many fruitless negotiations, Cromwell compelled the United Provinces to give the sum of £300,000, together with a small island, as compensation to the descendants of those who suffered in the “Amboyna massacre.” In 1796 the British, under Admiral Rainier, captured Amboyna, but restored it to the Dutch at the peace of Amiens in 1802. It was recaptured by the British in 1810, but once more restored to the Dutch in 1814. Population, about 50,000. See Moluccas. Amboyna, the chief town of the above island, and also of the Dutch Moluccas, is situated towards the north-west of the peninsula of Leitimor. The streets are broad and unpaved, running at right angles to one another, and intersected by numerous rivulets. The houses are of wood, roofed with palm leaves, and mostly of one storey, on account of the frequent earthquakes. An esplanade of 250 yards reaches from Fort Victoria to the town, and is terminated by a handsome range of houses. The townhouse is a neat structure of two storeys; and among the other buildings are two Protestant churches and a hospital. The government offices are in Fort Victoria. The roadstead of Amboyna is safe and commodious. Population, about 13,000.
