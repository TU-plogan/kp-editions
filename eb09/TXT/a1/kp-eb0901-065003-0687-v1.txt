AMADIS OF GAUL. The best edition for English readers of this famous work is to be found in the abridged translation of Southey, and the best account of it is to be found in his preface, which, however, is not void of error. Here, for example, is its final sentence :—“Amadis of Gaul is among prose what Orlando Furioso is among metrical romances—not the oldest of its kind, but the best.” We, of course, in England would place the Morte d' Arthur above all romances of the kind; and the praise that we allow to Amadis of Gaul is precisely that which Cervantes bestows upon it—of being the earliest and best of the Spanish romances. When the licentiate and the barber burnt the library of Don Quixote, they spared from the flames only three romances— Amadis of Gaul, Palmerin of England, and Tirante the White. “I have heard,” said the licentiate, " that Amadis of Gaul was the first book of chivalry printed in Spain, and that all the rest sprung from it; I think, therefore, as head of so pernicious a sect, we ought to condemn him to the fire without mercy.” “Not so, sir,” said the barber, “for I have heard also that it is the best of all the books of this kind; and therefore— as being unequalled in its way—it ought to be spared.” “You are right,” said the priest, “and for that reason its life is granted.” Although Cervantes speaks of the romance as a Spanish one, and although Southey translated it from the oldest extant edition, which is also Spanish, it is currently supposed to have been originally written in Portuguese by Vasco Lobeira, himself a good knight, who received his spurs on the field of battle from King Joam, and who died in 1403. The work, however, has been claimed as of French origin by the Comte de Tressan. Southey ridicules this theory, and insists upon the claims of the Portuguese author. It is quite certain that the Comte de Tressan attempted to prove too much; but, on the other hand, Southey has not allowed weight enough to the fact that the Amadis of Gaul is but the first work of romance which appeared in the Portuguese and Castilian languages; that it was preceded for more than a century by other romances of Anglo-Norman origin; and that, if not in its names and personages, yet in its idea—in the character of its incidents and in much of its geography—it belongs to the world of Anglo-Norman romance. What though we cannot lay our hands on the French original from which Lobeira translated, any more than we can lay our hands on Lobeira’s own work from which the Castilian version has been made, we still know that all the ideas and materials, all the design, all the machinery of Amadis of Gaul, belong to the Anglo-Norman cycle of romance which was in vogue before Lobeira was born. And in this creed we cheat him of nothing when we say that we know not to what extent he is entitled to the praise of originality. Knowing what we do of these romances, it is not enough to say, for the establishment of Lobeira’s claims, that we cannot trace the Amadis of G aul to any one before him. Expressions of his own throughout his work show that if he was not a literal translator, he was at least a borrower. Thus, towards the end of his third chapter he writes—“The author ceaseth to speak of this, and returneth to the child whom Gandales brought up.” The Spanish translator, Montalus, confesses to have taken liberties with the Portuguese version from which he worked, altering, adding, and abridging. The Comte de Tressan maintains that the original French work must have ended with the third book and the rescue of Oriana; and that from this point we can distinctly trace the work of Spanish hands. Southey, again, thinks that the work, as it left the hands of Lobeira, ended in the fourth book with the marriage of Amadis and Oriana, and that all which follows is due to the tasteless accretions of Montalus. Although this is mere conjecture, still it is natural that we should attach no little force to the correct feeling of Southey. For the story itself, it is impossible to give a summary of it—the plot being too disconnected; but he who has read one such tale, or even a few chapters of one, may have a general impression of all— hacking and hewing in every page, knights always at war and seeking adventures, giants in the path, lions in the forest, damsels in durance, castles to be attacked, wizards and witches with hate in their hearts, kings everywhere plentiful as blackberries, and lovely ladies abounding in tenderness. The sentiment of the work is very noble, and some of the descriptions are full of fire; but the reader owes more than he is aware to the curtailments of Southey.
