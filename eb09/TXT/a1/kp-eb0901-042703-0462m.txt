AIR was the name formerly given to all gaseous substances. The gas now known as oxygen, for instance, was named by Priestley dephlogisticated air, in contradistinction to nitrogen or azote, which was phlogisticated air. So hydrogen gas was known to the early chemists as inflammable air, carbonic acid gas as fixed air, &c. The name is now ordinarily restricted to what is more accurately called atmospheric air—the air we breathe—the invisible elastic fluid which surrounds the earth, extending to an unknown height. The properties of this fluid will be fully considered under such headings as Atmosphere, Barometer, Chemistry, Ventilation, &c. Reference may be made here to the mechanical use of air as a moving power, or rather as a means for transferring power, just as it is transferred by a train of wheelwork. Compressed air can be employed in this way with great advantage in mines, tunnels, and other confined situations, where the discharge of steam would be attended with inconvenience. The work is really done in these cases by a steam-engine or other prime mover in compressing the air. In the construction of the Mont Cenis tunnel the air was first compressed by water-power, and then carried through pipes into the heart of the mountain to work the boring machines. This use of compressed air in such situations is also of indirect advantage in serving not only to ventilate the place in which it is worked, but also to cool it; for it must be remembered that air falls in temperature during expansion, and therefore, as its temperature in the machines was only that of the atmosphere, it must, on being discharged from them, fall far below that temperature. This fall is so great that one of the most serious practical difficulties in working machines by compressed air has been found to be the formation of ice in the pipes by the freezing of the moisture in the air, which frequently chokes them entirely up.
