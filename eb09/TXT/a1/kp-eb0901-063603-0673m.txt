ALRESFORD (New), a market town in Hampshire, so named from a ford on the river Arle, a tributary of the Itchin, on which it is situated. It is 58 miles distant from London and 7 from Winchester. It suffered severely from a series of conflagrations, and partly on this account and from the decline of a small manufacture of linseys, it is now a place of little importance. Alresford House, the seat of the Rodney family, is in the neighbourhood, and the naval hero of that name was interred in New Alresford church in 1792. Miss Mitford 'was a native of Alresford. Alresford is a station on the L. and S.-W. Railway. Population of the parish of New Alresford (1871), 1623.
