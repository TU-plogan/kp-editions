AMMIRATO, Scipio, an Italian historian, born at Lecce, in the kingdom of Naples, on the 27th September 1531. His father intending him for the profession of law, sent him to study at Naples, but his own decided preference for literature prevented him from fulfilling his fatherâ€™s wishes. Entering the church, he resided for a time at Venice, and afterwards engaged in the service of Pope Pius IV. In 1569 he went to Florence, where he was fortunate in securing the patronage and support of Duke Cosmo I. It was at the suggestion of this prince that he wrote the work by which he is best known, his Istorie Florentine (1600). In 1595 he was made a canon of the cathedral of Florence. He died in 1601. Among the other works of Ammirato, some of which were first published after his death, may be mentioned discourses on Tacitus and histories of the families of Naples and Florence.
