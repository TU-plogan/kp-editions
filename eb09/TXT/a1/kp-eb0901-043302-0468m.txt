AJEHO, or A-she-hoh, also called Alchuku, a considerable and rapidly increasing city of Manchuria, 30 miles south of the river Soongari, and about 120 north of Kirin. It is advantageously situated on the slopes of a gentle descent leading to the river. The country around is very fertile, producing in abundance various kinds of grain, besides pulse and opium. The population of the district consists entirely of Chinese immigrants, who are engaged in the reclamation and cultivation of the soil, which is given to them at a nominal price. A large trade is done in the town; and although the shops are of mean appearance, quantities of porcelain and other ornamental articles exposed for sale indicate its growing wealth. The population is about 40,000, and includes a considerable number of Mahometans.
