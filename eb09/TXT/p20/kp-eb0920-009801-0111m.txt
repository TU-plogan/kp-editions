PÜCKLER-MUSKAU, Hermann Ludwig Heinrich, Prince of (1785-1871), a German author, was born at Muskau in Lusatia on 30th October 1785. He served for some time in the body-guard at Dresden, and afterwards travelled in France and Italy. In 1811, after the death of his father, he inherited the barony of Muskau and a considerable fortune. As an officer under the duke of Saxe-Weimar he distinguished himself in the war of liberation and was made military and civil governor of Bruges. After the war he retired from the army and visited England, where he remained about a year. In 1822, in compensation for certain privileges which he resigned, he was raised to the rank of prince by the king of Prussia. Some years earlier he had married the countess of Pappenheim, daughter of Prince Hardenberg; but he separated from her in 1826. He again visited England and travelled in America and Asia Minor, living after his return at Muskau, which he spent much time in cultivating and adorning. In 1845 he sold this estate, and, although he afterwards lived from time to time at various places in Germany and Italy, his principal residence was the castle of Branitz in the district of Kottbus, where he formed splendid gardens as he had already done at Muskau. In 1863 he was made an hereditary member of the Prussian Herrenhaus, and in 1866 he attended the Prussian general staff in the war with Austria. He died at Branitz on 4th February 1871, and, in accordance with instructions in his will, his body was burned. As a writer of books of travel he held a high position, his power of observation being keen and his style lucid and animated. His first work was Briefe eines Verstorbenen (1830-31), in which he expressed many independent judgments about England and other countries he had visited and about prominent persons whom he had met. Among his later books of travel were Semilasso ’ s vorletzter Weltgang (1835), Semilasso in Afrika (1836), Aus Mehemed-Ali ’ s Reich (1844), and Die Rückkehr (1846-48). He was also the author of Andeutungen uber Landschaftsgärtnerei (1834).
