PUDSEY, a township of the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on an acclivity rising above the valley of the Aire and on the Great Northern Railway, 4 miles east of Bradford and 6 south-west of Leeds. The principal buildings are the church of St Lawrence in the Gothic style, erected in 1821 and lately improved, and the mechanics’ institute, a fine building, comprising class-rooms, a library, a public hall, and a lecture hall. The town has an important woollen trade and possesses dyeing and fulling mills. Pudsey appears in Domesday as “Podechesaie.” It was sold by Edward II. to the Calverley family, from whom it passed to an ancestor of the Milners. By the Bradford Water and Improvement Act of 1881 part (37 acres) of the urban sanitary district of Pudsey was amalgamated with that of Bradford. The population of the diminished district (2409 acres) in 1871 was 12,173, and in 1881 it was 12,314.
