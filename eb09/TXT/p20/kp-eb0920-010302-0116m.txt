PULGAR, Fernando de, Spanish prose-writer of the latter part of the 15th century, born probably at Pulgar near Toledo, was brought up at the court of John II. Henry IV. made him one of his secretaries, and under Isabella he became a councillor of state, was charged with at least one mission to France, and in 1482 was appointed historiographer-royal. His official Chronicle of the reign of the Catholic sovereigns for the period previous to his appointment is loose and inaccurate; but in the later portion, where he had the advantage of personal knowledge, he is always precise and often graphic. It is not brought down beyond the year 1492. It was first printed at Valladolid in 1565 under the name of Antonio de Lebrija. Pulgarâ€™s Claros Varones de Castilla, a series of sketches of forty-six of the most celebrated men of the reign and court of Henry IV., is of considerable interest both for its matter and for its style. He wrote, besides, a commentary on the ancient Copias de Mingo Revulgo ; and thirty-two of his Letters written to various persons of eminence, including some to the queen, are also extant. The first edition of the Claros Varones was that of Seville (1500); some of the letters did not appear until 1528.
