PURI or Pooree, a district of British India in the Orissa division of the lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, lying between 19° 28' and 20° 16' N. lat. and 85° 0' and 86° 28' E. long., with an area of 2472 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by the native states of Banki and Athgarh, on the E. and N.E. by Cuttack district, on the S. by the Bay of Bengal, and on the W. by the Ganjam district of the Madras presidency and by the tributary state of Rampur. For the most part the country is flat, the only mountains being a low range which, rising in the west, runs south-east in an irregular line towards the Chilka Lake, and forms a water-parting between the district and the valley of the Mahanadi. The middle and eastern divisions of the district, forming the south-western part of the Mahanadi delta, consist entirely of alluvial plains, watered by a network of channels through which the most southerly branch of that river, the Koyakhai, finds its way into the sea. The principal rivers in Puri are the Bhargavi, the Daya, and the Nun, all of which flow into the Chilka Lake and are navigable by large boats during the rainy season, when the waters come down in tremendous floods, bursting the banks and carrying everything before them. The chief lakes are the Sar and the Chilka, the former, a backwater of the Bhargavi, being 4 miles long by 2 broad. The Chilka Lake is one of the largest in India; its length is 44 miles, and its breadth in some parts 20 miles. It is separated from the sea only by a narrow strip of sand. The lake is saline and everywhere very shallow, its mean depth ranging from 3 to 5 feet. Puri district is rich in historical remains, from the primitive rock-hewn caves of Buddhism—the earliest relics of Indian architecture—to the mediaeval sun temple at Kanarak and the world-renowned shrine of Jagannath. The chief roads in the district are the Calcutta and Madras trunk road and the pilgrim road from Cuttack to Puri. The climate of Puri is dry and healthy, and the average rainfall is 55 - 80 inches.

The census of 1881 returned the population of Puri district at 888,487 (446,609 males and 441,878 females). By religion 873,664 were returned as Hindus, 14,003 as Mohammedans, and 819 as Christians. The only town with a population exceeding 5000 is Pubi (q.v.). Puri is strictly a rice-growing tract, but pulses, jute, hemp, flax, and oil-seeds are also produced, while among its miscellaneous crops are tobacco, cotton, sugar-cane, and turmeric. The principal manufactures are salt, earthenware, and brass and bellmetal utensils and ornaments. In 1882-83 the total revenue of the district amounted to £79,493, towards which the land-tax contributed £60,255.

Puri first came under British administration in 1803. The only political events in its history since that date have been the rebellion of the maharaja of Khurda in 1804 and the rising of the paiks or peasant militia in 1817-18. Since then the country has been gradually restored to order and tranquillity.
