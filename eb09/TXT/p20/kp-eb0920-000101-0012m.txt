PRUDENTIUS, Aurelius Clemens, a Christian verse-writer, apparently a native of Spain, who flourished during the latter half of the 4th century and in the beginning of the 5th. According to the meagre and vague autobiographical notices given by himself in the preface to his poems he was born in the year 348, and, after receiving a liberal education, practised at the bar and subsequently held judicial office in two important cities. At the time of the publication of his poems in 405 he held from the emperor a high military appointment at court. Of his subsequent history nothing is known.

His extant works, besides the preface already referred to and an epilogue, are the following:—(1) Cathemerinon Liber, a series of twelve hymns {καθημερινών ύμνων) in various metres to be repeated or sung at particular periods of the day or seasons of the year; (2) Apotheosis, a poem of 1085 hexameter verses on the divinity of Christ; (3) Hamartigenia (967 hexameter verses) on the origin of evil and sin; (4) Psychomachia, or the conflict between virtue and vice for the soul (915 hexameter verses); (5) Contra Symmachum, two books, of 658 and 1131 hexameter verses respectively, directed against the petition of Symmachus to the emperor for the restoration of the altar and statue of Victory which Gratian had cast down; (6) Peristephaτwn Liber, fourteen poems in various metres, in honour of certain saints who had won the crown of martyrdom (hence the name, περί στεφάνων), — these, which are often vigorous and graphic, are generally considered to show Prudentius at his best; (7) Diptychon or Dittochaeon, a series of forty-nine hexameter tetrastichs on various events and characters mentioned in Scripture. The editio princeps appeared at Deventer in 1472; among modern editions may be named those of Faustus Arevalus (2 vols., Rome, 1788-89), Obbarius (Tubingen, 1845), and Dressel (Leipsic, 1860).
