PUEBLA, or in full La Puebla delos Angeles, a city of Mexico, formerly capital of the province of Tlaxcala, now of the state of Puebla, lies 76 miles south-east of Mexico, in 19° N. lat. and 98° 2' W. long., at a height of 7220 feet above the sea. It is admirably situated on a spacious and fertile plateau, which, while almost destitute of trees, is, especially in the neighbourhood of the city, clothed with gardens and fields. To the south-west rises the summit of Popocatepetl, and Orizaba and Iztaccihuatl are also within the horizon. By Humboldt Puebla was ranked as the most important city of Spanish America after Mexico, Guanajuato, and Havana, and in the matter of population it still stands third among the state capitals. Its spacious streets run exactly east-west and north-south, and its houses, often of three stories, are solidly built of stone and in Spanish style. The cathedral, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, was commenced in 1552 after the designs of Juan Gomez de Mora, but it was not completed until 1649, after Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza had devoted eight years of strenuous effort to the enterprise. It is rather more than 320 feet long and 165 wide, and consists of a nave 80 feet high, with side aisles and a dome, the upper portion of which is constructed of pumice-stone for the sake of lightness. The main front, like the columns of the interior, is in the Doric style, but its two side towers are Ionic. In one is a great bell cast in 1637 and weighing upwards of 8 tons. Apart from the cathedral Puebla was famous for the number, and more especially for the lavish decoration of its churches, monasteries, and colleges. Several of these (such as the church and convent of Santo Domingo and the church of S. Felipe Neri) are still of note, and the city also contains a museum, a theatre, &c. Puebla has long been one of the great trading and manufacturing centres of the country, and it has recently become an important point in the rapidly-developing railway system, having in 1884 lines to Apizaco on the railway from Vera Cruz to Mexico (28 miles), to Villa de Libres (58 miles), to San Martin (24 miles), to Matamoros Izucar (31 miles), and to San Juan de los Llanos. Cotton and woollen goods, leather, earthenware, soap, and glass are the leading manufactures. The population, which was about 80,000 in 1746 and 52,717 in 1793, and which greatly decreased during the revolutionary period, is now (1885) stated at 75,000.

Puebla was founded in 1533-34 by Sebastian Ramirez de Fuenleal, archbishop of Santo Domingo, and the Franciscan friar Toribio Motolinia. In 1550 it became the seat of the bishopric which had originally been founded in 1526 at Tlaxcala. The epithet “de los Angeles,” which is now practically dropped, was in the 17th and 18th centuries the chief part of the name, which often appears simply as Angeles. It is associated with a popular belief that during the building of the cathedral two angels every night added as much to the height of the walls as the workmen had managed to add in the preceding day. In 1845 Santa Anna made an unsuccessful attempt to capture the city. On 18th March 1863 it was invested by the French under Forey, and on 17th May taken by storm.
