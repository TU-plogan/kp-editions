PUFF-BIRD, the name first given, according to Swainson {Zool. Illustrations, ser. 1, ii., text to pl. 99), by English residents in Brazil to a group of Birds known to ornithologists as forming the testricted Family Bucconidae, but for a long time confounded, under the general name of Barbets, with the Capitonidae of modern systematists, who regard the two Families as differing very considerably from one another. Some authors have used the generic name Capito in a sense precisely opposite to that which is now usually accorded to it, and the natural result has been to produce one of the most complex of the many nomenclatural puzzles that beset Ornithology. Fortunately there is no need here to enter upon this matter, for each group has formed the subject of· an -elaborate work—the Capitonidae being treated by the Messrs Marshall,^[1. A Monograph of the Capitonidae or Scansorial Barbets, by C. H. T. and G. F. L. Marshall, London, 1870-71, 4to. ] and the Bucconidae by Mr Sclater^[2. A Monograph of the Jacamars and Puff-birds, or Families Galbulidae and Bucconidae, by P. L. Sclater, London, 1879-82, 4to. ] —in each of which volumes the origin of the confusion has been explained, and to either of them the more curious reader may be confidently referred. The Bucconidae are zygodactylous Birds belonging to the large heterogeneous assemblage in the present work generally looked upon as forming the “Order” Picariae (see Ornithology, vol. xviii. p. 41), and commonly considered nowadays to be most nearly allied to the Galbulidae (Jacamar. vol. xiii. p. 531), and like them confined to the Neotropical Region, in the middle parts of which, and especially in its Sub-Andean Sub-region, the Puff-birds are, as regards species, abundant; while only two seem to reach Guatemala and but one Paraguay. As with most South-American Birds, the habits and natural history of the Bucconidae have been but little studied, and of only one species, which happens to belong to a rather abnormal genus, has the nidification been described. This is the Chelidoptera tenebrosa, which is said to breed in holes in banks, and to lay white eggs much like those of the Kingfisher and consequently those of the Jacamars. From his own observation Swainson writes (Zoe. cit.) that Puff-birds are very grotesque in appearance. They will sit nearly motionless for hours on the dead bough of a tree, and while so sitting “the disproportionate size of the head is rendered more conspicuous by the bird raising its feathers so as to appear not unlike a puff ball. . . . When frightened their form is suddenly changed by the feathers lying quite flat.” They are very confiding birds and will often station themselves a few yards only from a window. The Bucconidae almost without exception are very plainly-coloured, and the majority have a spotted or mottled plumage suggestive of immaturity. The first Puff-bird known to Europeans seems to have been that described by Marcgrave under the name of “Tamatia,” by which it is said to have been called in Brazil, and there is good reason to think that his description and figure—the last, comic as it is in outline and expression, having been copied by Willughby and many of the older authors—apply to the Bucco maculatus of modern Ornithology—a bird placed by Brisson {Ornithologie, iv. p. 524) among the Kingfishers. But if so, Marcgrave described and figured the same species twice, since his “Matuitui” is also Brisson’s “Martin-pescheur tacheté du Brésil. ”

Mr Sclater in his Monograph divides the Family into 7

genera, of which Bucco is the largest and contains 20 species. The others are Malacoptila and Monacha each with 7, Nonnula with 5, Chelidoptera with 2, and Micro-monacha and Hapaloptila with 1 species each. The most showy Puff-birds are those of the genus Monacha with an inky-black plumage, usually diversified by white about the head, and a red or yellow bill. The rest call for no particular remark.
