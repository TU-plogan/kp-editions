PUBLILIUS (less correctly written Publius) Syrus, a Latin writer of farces (mimi), flourished in the 1st century b.c. He was a native of Syria and was brought as a slave to Italy, but by his wit and talent he won the favour of his master, who freed and educated him. His farces, in which he acted himself, had a great success in the provincial towns of Italy and at the games given by Caesar in 46 b.c. Publilius appeared on the stage at Rome and received from Caesar himself the prize for a histrionic contest in which the actor vanquished all his competitors, including the celebrated Laberius. For the rest, we learn from Jerome that in 43 Publilius still enthralled the Roman playgoers. Cicero witnessed with pleasure the exhibition of his plays, and Seneca was a warm admirer of his wise and witty sayings. All that remains of his works is a collection of Sentences (sententiae), a series of moral maxims in iambic and trochaic verse. This collection must have been made at a very early date, since it was known to Aulus Gellius in the 2d century a.d. Each maxim is comprised in a single verse, and the verses are arranged in alphabetical order according to their initial letters. In course of time the collection was interpolated with sentences drawn from other writers, especially from apocryphal writings of Seneca; the number of genuine verses is about 700. They include many pithy sayings, such as the famous “judex damnatur ubi nocens absolvitur.” The best editions of the Sentences are those of E. Wölfflin (Teubner, 1869) and W. Meyer (Teubner, 1880).
