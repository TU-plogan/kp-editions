RÚDAGÍ (d. 954). Hakim Mohammed Farid-eddin 'Abdallfih, the first great genius of modern Persia, was born in Rùdag, a village in Transoxiana, about 870-900, —totally blind, as most of his biographers assert, although the fine distinction of colours and the minute description of the various tints and shades of flowers in his poems flatly contradict the customary legend of the “blind minstrel.” In his eighth year he knew the whole Korfin by heart and had begun to write verses. He had besides a wonderful voice which enraptured all hearers, and he played in a masterly way on the lute. The fame of these accomplishments at last reached the ear of the Sfimfinid Nasr II. bin Ahmad, the ruler of Khorâsân and Transoxiana (913— 942), who drew the poet to his court and distinguished him by his personal favour. Riidagi became his daily companion, rose to the highest honours, and grew rich in worldly wealth. He received so many costly presents that he could allow himself the extravagance of keeping two hundred pages, and that four hundred camels were necessary to carry all his property. In spite of various predecessors he well deserves the title of “father of Persian literature,” since he was the first who impressed upon every form of epic, lyric, and didactic poetry its peculiar stamp and its individual character. He is also said to have been the founder of the “diwfin,” that is, the typical form of the complete collection of a poet’s lyrical compositions in a more or less alphabetical order which prevails to the present day among all Mohammedan writers. His poems filled, according to all statements, one hundred volumes and consisted of one million three hundred thousand verses; but of this there remain only fifty-two kasidas, ghazals, and rubfi'is; of his epic masterpieces we have nothing beyond a few stray lines found here and there as illustrations of ancient Persian words and phrases in native dictionaries. But the most serious loss is that of his translation of Ibn Mukaffa’s Arabic version of the old Indian fable book Kalilah and Dimnah, which he put into Persian verse at the request of his royal patron, and for which he received the handsome reward of 40,000 dirhems. In his kasidas, which are all devoted to the praise of his sovereign and friend, Rfidagi has left us unequalled models of a refined and delicate taste, very different from the often bombastic compositions of later Persian encomiasts, and these alone would entitle him to a foremost rank among the poets of his country; but his renown is considerably enhanced by his odes and epigrams. Those of a didactic tendency express in well-measured lines a sort of Epicurean philosophy—in the loftiest sense of the word—on human life and human happiness; more charming still are the purely lyrical pieces, sweet and fascinating songs, which glorify the two everlasting delights of glowing hearts and cheerful minds—love and wine. Rfidagi survived his royal friend, and died long after the splendid days of Nasr’s patronage, the time of wealth and luxury, had passed away—poor and forgotten by the world, as one of his poems, a beautiful elegy, seems to indicate—in 954.

A complete edition of all the extant poems of Rfidagi, in Persian text and metrical German translation, together with a biographical account, based on forty-six Persian MSS., is found in Dr Ethé’s “Rfidagi der Samanidendichter ” .GFottvnger Nachrichten, 1873, pp. 663-742).
