RUGBY a market-town of Warwickshire, is finely situated on a table-land rising from the southern bank of the Avon, at the junction of several railway lines, and near the Grand Junction Canal, 30 miles E.S.E. of Birmingham, and 20 S.S.W. of Leicester. It is a well-built town, with a large number of modern houses erected for private residences. It occupies C, gravel site, is well drained, and has a good supply of water. It owes its importance to the grammar school, built and endowed by Laurence Sheriff, a merchant grocer and servant to Queen Elizabeth, and a native of the neighbouring village of Brownsover. The endowment consisted of the parsonage of Brownsover, Sheriff’s mansion house in Rugby, and one-third (8 acres) of his estate in Middlesex, near the Foundling Hospital, London, which, being let on building leases, gradually increased to about £5000 a year. The full endowment was obtained in 1653. The school originally stood opposite the parish church, and was removed to its [9:21:56]present site on the south side of the town between 1710 and 1750. In 1809 it was rebuilt from designs by Hake-will; the chapel, dedicated to St Lawrence, was added in 1820. At the tercentenary of the school in 1867 subscriptions were set on foot for founding scholarships, building additional schoolrooms, rebuilding or enlarging the chapel, and other objects. The chapel was rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1872. A swimming bath was erected in 1876; the Temple observatory, containing a fine equatorial refractor by Alvan Clark, was built in 1877, and the Temple reading room with the art museum in 1878. The workshops underneath the gymnasium were opened in 1880, and a new big school and class rooms were erected in 1885. There are three major and four minor exhibitions for students to any university in the United Kingdom. From about 70 in 1777 the numbers attending the school have increased to over 400. A great impulse was given to the progress of the school during the headmastership of Dr Arnold, 1827-1842. The best known of Arnold’s successors are Tait, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, and Temple, the present bishop of London. The parish church of St Andrew’s is, with the exception of the tower and the north arcade in the nave, entirely modern, having been built from designs by Mr Butterfield at a cost of £22,000, and reconsecrated in 1879. The daughter church of the Holy Trinity, a handsome building by Sir Gilbert Scott, in close proximity to St Andrew’s, was erected in 1853. St Marie’s Catholic Church is in the Early English style. A town-hall was erected in 1858, at a cost of £7000. There are a number of charities, including Laurence Sheriff’s almshouses (founded 1567), Elborow’s almshouses (1707), Miss Butlin’s almshouses (1851),and the hospital of StCross, opened in 1884, at a cost of £20,000. A public recreation ground was provided by the local government board in 1877. The town has an important cattle market. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1617 acres) in 1871 was 8385, and in 1881 it was 9891.

Rugby was originally a hamlet of the adjoining parish of Clifton-on-Dunsmore, and is separately treated of as such in Domesday Book. Ernaldus de Bosco (Ernald de Bois), lord of the manor of Clifton, seems to have erected the first chapel in Rugby, in the reign of Stephen, about 1140. It was afterwards granted by him, with certain lands, to endow the abbey of St Mary, Leicester, which grant was confirmed by his successors and by royal charter of Henry II. In the second year of King John (1200) a suit took place between Henry de Rokeby, lord of the manor of Rugby, and l’aul, abbot of St Mary, Leicester, which resulted in the former obtaining possession of the advowson of Rugby, on condition of homage and service to the abbot of Leicester. By virtue of this agreement the chapel was converted into a parish church, and the vicarage into a rectory. In 1350 Ralph, Lord Stafford, became possessed of the manor and advowson of Rugby, and considerably enlarged the parish church. Subsequent alterations, notably in 1814 and 1831, left little of this structure remaining except the tower and north arcade in the nave. The advowson of Kugby is now the property of the earl of Craven; and the late rector was widely known and honoured as “the poet pastor,” John Moultrie.
