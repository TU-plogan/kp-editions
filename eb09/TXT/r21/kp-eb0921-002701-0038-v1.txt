ROUSSEAU Théodore (1812-1867), a distinguished landscape painter, was born at Paris, and studied in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, after which he spent some time in travelling and making studies of landscape and sky effects. He first exhibited at the Salon in 1834, obtained gold medals in 1849 and 1854, and in 1852 received the Legion of Honour. His paintings became very popular in France, and Rousseau grew to be the acknowledged founder of the modern realistic school of landscape. He was largely influenced in style by Constable and Turner, the former of whom was perhaps more thoroughly appreciated in France than in England. The influence of Turner is clearly seen in some of Rousseau’s pictures, with striking effects of cloud or storm,—as, for example, in his Effet de Soleil and Après la Pluie (1852), in the Matinée [9:21:28]Orageuse (1857), the Coucher de Soleil (1866), and one of his last works, the Soleil par un Temps Orageux, which appeared in the exhibition of 1867. Rousseau’s study of Constable is more especially apparent in some of his fine forest scenes near Fontainebleau, and in some magnificently painted views on the banks of the Loire and other French rivers. His execution was of extraordinary brilliance, and he was a thorough master of atmospheric effect and glowing sunset colours. Though in some respects a realistic painter, he treated nature in a strongly dramatic way and showed great imaginative power. His style is broad and dashing, with rapid and at times apparently careless handling. His fame has increased rather than diminished since his death in 1867; and one of his paintings has recently received the high distinction of being transferred from the Luxembourg Palace to the Louvre, an honour which is but rarely conferred. It is not, however, one of the best specimens of his work. Most of Théodore Rousseau’s pictures are in private collections in Paris and elsewhere in France.
