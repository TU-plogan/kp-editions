ROULERS or Rousselaere, a town of Belgium, in the province of West Flanders, on the Mandelbeke, a tributary of the Lys, 22âˆ£ miles south of Ostend on the railway to Courtrai. From time immemorial it has been the seat of a great weaving industry, which now produces both cotton, union, and linen goods; and it also manufactures in various other departments. The principal buildings are the town-house, the college, and the church of St Michel with its conspicuous Gothic tower. The population was 16,345 in 1874, and 17,219 in 1884.

Roulers is mentioned in 822 as Roslar and in 847 as Rollare. Baldwin VIII., count of Flanders, died in a house in the principal square of the town in 1120 on Iiisreturn from the battle of Angers. In 1794 Roulers was the scene of a conflict between the Austrians and the French.
