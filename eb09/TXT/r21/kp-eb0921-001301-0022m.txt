ROUGE. This name is applied to various colouring substances of a brilliant carmine tint, especially when used as cosmetics. The least harmful of these preparations are such as have for their basis carthamine, obtained from the safflower (Garthamus tiηctorius). The Chinese prepare a rouge, said to be from safflower, which, spread on the cards on which it is sold, has a brilliant metallic green lustre, but when moistened and applied to the skin assumes a delicate carmine tint. Jeweller’s rouge for polishing gold and silver plate is a fine red oxide of iron prepared by calcination from sulphate of iron (green vitriol).
