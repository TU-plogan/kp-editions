RUPERT(Heodbert), St, a kinsman of the Merovingian house, and bishop of Worms, was invited (696) to Regensburg (Ratisbon) by Theodo of Bavaria, but finally settled in Salzburg, the bishopric of which was his foundation. He is regarded as the apostle of the Bavarians, not that the land was up to that time altogether heathen, but because of his services in the promotion and consolidation of its Christianity.

The Gesta Sancti Hrodberti Confessoris have been printed in the Archivfwr Oesterreich. Geschichte, 1882, from a 10th-century MS.
