ROTHWELL an urban sanitary district in the West Riding of Yorkshire, situated in a pleasant valley four miles south of Leeds. It is of great antiquity, and soon after the Conquest was granted as a dependency of the castle of Pontefract to the Lacys, who erected at it a baronial residence of which there are still some remains. The church of the Holy Trinity is an old structure in [9:21:4]the Later English style with embattled parapet. There are a mechanics’ institute and a working men’s club. Coal and stone are obtained in the neighbourhood, and the town possesses match works and rope and twine factories. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 3302 acres) in 1871 was 3733, and in 1881 it was 5105.
