RÜCKERTFriedrich (1788-1866), an eminent German poet, was born at Schweinfurt on the 16th May 1788. He was educated at the gymnasium of his native place and at the universities of Würzburg and Heidelberg, where he studied law and philology. Having taken his degree, he went to the university of Jena as a “privat-docent”; but this position he soon abandoned. For some time he worked in connexion with the Morgenblatt at Stuttgart. Nearly the whole of the year 1818 he spent in Rome, where he devoted himself to study, especially to the study of the popular poetry of Italy; and afterwards he lived for several years at Coburg. He was appointed a professor of Oriental languages at the university of Erlangen in 1826, and in 1841 he was called to a similar position in Berlin, where he was also made a privy councillor. In 1849 he resigned his professorship at Berlin, and went to live on his estate near Coburg. He died on the 31st January 1866. When Riickert began his literary career, Germany was engaged in her life-and-death struggle with Napoleon; and in his first volume, Deutsche Gedichte, published in 1814 under the name of Freimund Raimar, he gave vigorous expression to the prevailing sentiment of his countrymen. In 1816 appeared Napoleon, eine politische Komodie in drei Stücken, and in 1817 the Kranz der Zeit. He issued a collection of poems, Oestliche Rosen, in 1822; and in 1834-38 his Gesammelte Gedichte were published in six volumes, a selection from which has passed through many editions. Riickert, who was master of thirty languages, made his mark chiefly as a translator of Oriental poetry, and as a writer of poems conceived in the spirit of Oriental masters. Much attention was attracted by Die Verwandlungen des Abu Seid, a translation of Hariri’s Makamen (1826), Nal und Damajanti, an Indian tale (1828), Amrilkais, der Dichter und König (1843), and Hamasa, oder die ältesten arabischen Volkslieder (1846). Among his original poems dealing with Oriental subjects are Morgenlandische Sagen und Geschichten (1837), Erbauliches und Beschauliches aus dem Morgenland (1836-38), Rostem und Suhrab, eine Heldengeschidite (1838), and Brahinanische Erzählungen (1839). The most elaborate of his works is Die Weisheit des Brahmanen, published in six volumes in 1836-39. In 1843-45 he issued several dramas, all of which are greatly inferior to the work to which he owes his distinctive place in German literature. At the time of the Danish war in 1864 he wrote Ein Dutzend Kampf-Lieder für Schlesurig-Holstein, which, although published anonymously, produced a considerable impression. After his death many poetical translations and original poems were found among his papers, and several collections of them were published. Rückert lacked the simple and natural feeling which is characteristic of all the greatest lyrical poets of Germany. But he had a certain splendour of imagination which made Oriental poetry congenial to him, and he has seldom been surpassed in his power of giving rhythmic expression to ideas on the conduct of life. As a master of poetical style he ranks with German writers of the highest class. There are hardly any lyrical forms which are not represented among his works, and in all of them, the simplest and the most complex, he wrote with equal ease and grace.

A complete edition of Riickerfs poetical λvorks appeared in Frankfort in 1868-69.
