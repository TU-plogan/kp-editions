RYAZAÑ, capital of the above government, lies 119 miles to the south-east of Moscow, on the elevated right bank of the Trubej, a mile above its junction with the Oka. A wide prairie dotted with large villages, being the bottom of a former lake, spreads out from the base of the crag on which Ryazan stands, and has the aspect of an immense lake when it is inundated in the spring. Except one or two streets, the town is badly built, chiefly of wood, and ill-paved. It has often suffered from fire, and has few remains of former days. The large church of Uspensk dates from 1770. Those of Arkhangelsk and Kresto-vozdvijensk have preserved, however, their old architecture, though obliterated to some extent by subsequent repairs, as also the archiépiscopal palace, formerly the “terem” of the great princes. The industries are undeveloped, and the trade has less importance than might be expected from the position of the town in so rich a region. It is, however, an important railway centre, no less than 15,000,000 cwts., chiefly of corn, being brought from the south-east and sent on to Moscow, while nearly 3,390,000 cwts. of various manufactured and grocery wares are conveyed in the opposite direction. The loading place on the Oka also has some importance. The population, 30,325 in 1883, is increasing but slowly.

The capital of Ryazafi principality was Ryazafi—now Old Ryazafi, a village close to Spassk, also on the Oka. It is mentioned in annals as early as 1097, but continued to be the chief town of the principality only until the 14th century. In the 11th century one of the Kieff princes—probably Yaroslaff Svyatoslavitch in 1095—founded, on the banks of a small lake, a fort which received tho name of Pereyaslaff-Ryazaiiskiy. In 1294 (or in 1335) the bishop of Murom, compelled to leave his own town and probably following the usual policy of that epoch,—that of selecting a new town with no municipal traditions, as the nucleus of a new state, —settled in Pereyaslaff-Ryazanskiy, and thus gave new importance to this formerly insignificant settlement. The great princes of Ryazaft followed his example and by-and-by completely abandoned the old republican town of Ryazan, transferring also its name to Pereyaslair-Ryazanskiy. In 1300 a congress of Russian princes was held there, and in the following year the town was taken by the Moscow prince. It continued, however, to be the residence of the Ryazafi princes until 1517. In 1365 and 1377 it was plundered and burned by Tartars, but in the two following centuries (in 1460, 1513, 1521, and 1564) it was strong enough to repel them. Earthen walls with towers were erected after 1301; and in the 17th century a “kreml” still stood on the high crag above the Trubej. Ryazan became chief town of the Ryazan lieutenancy in 1778.
