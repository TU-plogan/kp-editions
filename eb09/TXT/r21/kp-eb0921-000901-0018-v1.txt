ROTTERDAM a city of the Netherlands in the province of South Holland, situated in 51“ 55' 19'' N. lat. and 4" 29' 7" E. long., on the right bank of the Nieuwe Maas at the point where it is joined by the Rotte, a small stream rising near Moerkapelle. By rail it is 14 J miles south-east of The Hague and 44⅜ south of Amsterdam. As defined by its 17th-century fortifications the town was an isosceles triangle with a base of I^ miles along the river, but in modern times it has spread out in all directions beyond the limits of its own commune (which was increased in 1869 by the island of Fijenoord and part of the south bank of the river) into those of Delfshaven, Kralingen, and Hillegersberg. A huge dyke on which stands Hoog Straat or High Street divides the triangular portion into nearly equal parts—the inner and the outer town; and the latter is cut up into a series of peninsulas and islands by the admirable system of harbours to which Rotterdam owes so much of its prosperity. The central part of the river frontage is lined by a broad quay called the Boompjes from the trees with which it is planted. From the apex of the triangle the town is bisected by a great railway viaduct (erected about 1870, and mainly constructed of iron), which is continued across the river to Fijenoord and the south bank by a bridge on a similarly grand scale, the line being the Great Southern Railway which connects Belgium and Holland and crosses the Hollandsch Diep by the Moerdijk bridge. Parallel with the railwaybridge the municipality, in 1873, built a road-bridge, and apart from tbeir ordinary function these constructions have proved a sufficient barrier to prevent the ice-blocks of the upper part of the river from descending so as to interfere with the seaward navigation. Tramways, introduced in 1880, are being gradually extended to various suburbs. While some nine or ten Protestant sects, the Roman Catholics, the Old Roman Catholics, and the Jews are all represented in Rotterdam, none of the ecclesiastical buildings are of primary architectural interest. The Groote Kerk or Laurenskerk is a Gothic brick structure of the fifteenth century with a tower 297 feet high; it has a fine rood screen and an excellent organ, and contains the monuments of Lambert Hendriks-zoon, Egbert Meeuweszoon Kortenaar, Witte Corneliszoon de Witt, Johan van Brakel, Johan van Liefde, and other Dutch naval heroes. Among the more conspicuous secular buildings are the Boymans Museum, the town-house (restored in 1823-1827), the exchange (1723), the Delft Gate (1766), the court-house, the post and telegraph office (1875), the corn exchange, the seamen’s home (1855), the hospital (1846), and the theatres. The Boymans AIuseum is mainly a picture gallery, which became the property of the town in 1847. When the building, originally erected in 1662-63 as the assembly house of Schieland, was burned down in 1864, most of the pictures perished, but the museum was restored by 1867, and the collection, steadily recruited, is again rich in the works of Dutch artists. The ground floor also contains the city archives and the city library. The maritime museum, established in 1874 by the Yacht Club, is a remarkable collection of ship models, and the Society of Experimental Philosophy has a considerable collection of instruments, books, and specimens. At the north-west corner of the town an area of several acres is occupied by the zoological garden, which dates from 1857. Besides the Erasmus Gymnasium the [9:21:10]educational institutions comprise an academy of art and technical science, a naval school, an industrial school, a deaf and dumb asylum, <fcc. In the Groote Markt (to the south of the Hoog Straat) stands the bronze statue of Erasmus (Gerrit Gerrits), erected by his fellow-citizens in 1662; and his birth-house, now a tavern in Wijde Kerk-straat, is distinguished by a Latin inscription. The statue by Grefs of Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp (1762-1834), a great Dutch statesman, gives his name to the Hogeudorpsplein, formerly Boymansplein, behind the museum; in the “Park,” which extends west along the bank of the Maas, is a marble statue by Strackée of Hendrik Tollens, tho Dutch poet; and the Nieuwmarkt is adorned with a fountain in memory of the jubilee (1863) of the restoration of Dutch independence (1813). Extensive works for supplying the town with filtered water were constructed between 1870 and 187δ, the water in the river and - canals being rendered unwholesome by the sewerage, the treatment of which naturally presents great difficulties in a city lying in great part below high-water level. The most important industrial establishment is that of the Netherlands Steamboat Company, who are shipowners, shipbuilders, and engineers; there are also extensive sugar-refineries and a great variety of smaller factories for the production of lead, iron, and copper wares, white lead, varnishes, tobacco and cigars, beer and vinegar, chocolate and confectionery, Ac. Rotterdam is, however, not so much a manufacturing as a commercial city, and its commercial progress has been very striking since the middle of the century. While in 1846 it had only 321,764 tons out of the total of 1,024,705 tons which then represented the export trade of the Netherlands, in 1883 it had 1,940,026 tons out of a total of 3,953,009 tons. In 1850 it had only 27 , 9 per cent, of the outgoing vessels, and 35 , 77 per cent, of the tonnage; by 1870 it had 35 , 60 per cent, of the vessels and 50 - 37 of the tonnage, and by 1883 43 - 75 per cent, of the vessels, and 49Ό8 of the tonnage. Rotterdam has thus become what Amsterdam formerly was—the principal port in the country. For steamers it is now, since the opening of the new waterway through the Hoek van Holland in 1872, only two hours distant from the sea, and the channel is deep enough for vessels drawing 22 feet of water. ^[1.] From 4471 vessels with a register tonnage of 1,688,700 tons in 1873, the shipping clearing from the Netherlands by the new waterway had increased by 1884 to 8177 vessels with register tonnage of 4,382,100 tons. Upwards of 18,000 emigrants left Europe by Rotterdam in 1881. Besides its maritime trade Rotterdam commands a most extensive river traffic, not only with the towns of the Netherlands, but with those of Belgium and Germany. With Germany alone its Rhine traffic amounted in 1883 to 1,706,587 tons, against 2,021,644 for all the other ports of the Netherlands. On January 1, 1885, Rotterdam owned 43 sailing vessels and 50 steam-ships with a uni ted aggregate burden of 99,018 tons. Owing to the great increase of navigation and commerce tho berthing accommodation of the port frequently proves too small, though by the works at Fijenoord the length of tho quays has of late years been extended by about 8000 metres. This island, two-thirds of which was purchased by tho town in 1591 and the remaining third in 1658, was dyked in 1795, and became the.seat of a building which has been in succession a pest-house, a military hospital, a naval college, and a private industrial school. The Netherlands Steamboat Company established its workshops there in 1825; and in 1873 the Rotterdam Trading Company began to construct the harbours and warehouses which have been purchased by the city. The population of the commune of Rotterdam, which did not much exceed 20,000 in 1632, was 53,212 in 1796, 72,294 in 1830, 88,812 in 1850, 105,858 in 1860, 132,054 in 1876, and 148,102 in 1879-80. In 1870 the city contained 111,256 inhabitants, the suburbs 3341, and the ships 2478, and in 1884 the total, exclusive of the shipping, was 169,477.

Rotterdam probably owes its origin to the ca6tles of Wena and Bulgei - Stein, of which the former was laid in ruins by tho Hoek party in 1426. In 1299 Count John I. granted the “good people of Rotterdam” the same rights as the burghers of Beverwijk, and freedom from toll in all his lands. In 1597 a sixth extension of the town’s area took place, and a seventh followed in 1609. Francis of Brederodeseized the place in 1488, but had to surrender it to tho emperor Maximilian in 1489. The Spaniards were in possession from April 9th to July 31st 1572, Iiavinggained entrance partly by treachery and partly by force (see Motley, Dutch Repτιblie, ii.). It was at a meeting of the states held at Rotterdam in June 1574 that the relief of Leyden was determined on, though it was not till 1580 that the town obtained a vote in the assembly.
