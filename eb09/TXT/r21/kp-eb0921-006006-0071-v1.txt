RUNNING. In this mode of progression the step is lighter and gait more rapid than in walking, from which it differs in consisting of a succession of springs from toe to toe, instead of a series of steps from toe to heel. As an athletic exercise, it has been in vogue from the earliest times, and the simple foot race, δpd∕χoς, run straight from starting point to goal, was a game of the Greek pentathlon. It was diversified with the διαυλοδρό/zoç, in which a distance mark was rounded and the starting and winning points were the same, and also by the δρό/zoç οπλιτών, which might be compared to the modern heavy marching order race. In ancient Italy running was practised in circus exhibitions, as described by Virgil (√Λ7ι. v. 286 sqj. In modern times it has been developed almost into a science by the Anglo-Saxon race in Great Britain and North America, till the distances recently covered appear almost [9:21:61]fabulous compared with the performances up to the end of the first half of the century. In all kinds of running the entire weight of the body is thrown on the toes, from which light strides are taken with all possible freedom of action from the hips. At starting the feet are placed about a foot apart, the body being inclined slightly forward, with the weight of it on the right or Iiindermost foot. A bent double position with the feet wide apart is on no account advisable. The start cannot be made too quickly on the signal being given. Two or three short steps are taken to get fairly into stride, after which the runner should look straight before him, set his eyes steadfastly on the goal, and run towards it at his longest and quickest stride, care being taken not to swerve or get out of stride.

Running is usually thus classified :—(1) sprinting includes all distances up to 400 yards; (2) medium distances range from one quarter to three quarters of a mile; (3) long distances are those of one mile and upwards. The first-named is the most popular, and is much practised in the north of England, especially at Sheffield, which may be termed the home of sprint running. It is less fatiguing than long distances and requires less arduous training, while strength to a certain extent replaces wind. A great point in sprinting is to obtain a good start, for which purpose incessant practice is required. A first-class sprinter when at full sp.eed will clear from 8 to 9 feet in each stride, and his toes leave the ground with inconceivable rapidity. When in good condition he will run 100 yards at top speed in one breath, and probably 150 yards without drawing a second one. The quickest authenticated times in which short distances have been run on perfectly level ground are as follows :—120 yards, 11⅜ sec.; 150 yards, 15 sec.; 200 yards, 19⅜ sec.; 300 yards, 30 sec.; and 400 yards, 43 j sec.

Of medium distances the quarter mile race is by far the most difficult to run, as a combination of speed and endurance is requisite. In fact a runner should be able to sprint the whole way. Six hundred yards and half a mile are the other chief distances in this class of running. The stride is slower than in sprinting, and a man cannot maintain the same speed throughout as is possible up to 300 yards. The best authenticated times are—quarter mile, 48J sec ∙ > 600 yards, 1 min. 11⅜ sec.; half mile, 1 min. 53⅛ sec.; 1000 yards, 2 min. 13 sec.; three quarter mile, 3 min. 7 sec.

Light wiry men are best fitted for long-distance running, where stamina and wind are more useful than speed. The strides must be long and light. After some miles a runner is unable to keep the weight of the body on his toes any longer owing to fatigue, puts his heels down, and runs flat-footed. The times accomplished of late years by long-distance runners are most remarkable. Those for the chief distances are as follows :—1 mile, 4 min. 16⅜ sec.; 2 miles, 9 min. 11⅜ sec.; 3 miles, 14 min. 36 sec.; 4 miles, 19 min. 36 sec.; 5 miles, 24 min. 40 sec.; 10 miles, 51 min. 6⅛ sec.; 20 miles, 1 h. 56 min. 38 sec.; 30 miles, 3 h. 15 min. 9 sec.; 40 miles, 4 h. 34 min. 27 sec.; 50 miles, 6 h. 8 min.; 100 miles, 13 h. 26 min. 30 sec.; 200 miles, 35 h. 9 min. 28 sec.; 300 miles, 58 h. 17 min. 6 sec.; 400 miles, 85 h. 52 min.; 500 miles, 109 h. 18 min. 20 sec.; 600 miles, 137 h. 25 min. 10 sec.; 610 miles, 140 h. 34 min. 10 sec.

Nearly all running contests now take place on prepared cinder paths, which from their springiness assist speed considerably. A runner’s dress should be as light as possible, and consist merely of a thin jersey, a pair of drawers covering the waist and loins and extending downwards to the top of the knee caps, and heelless running shoes with a few short spikes in the soles just under the tread of the foot. The spikes are longer for sprinting. Chamois leather socks for the toes and ball of the foot may be added, since they diminish concussion as each foot reaches the ground. Since the introduction of Athletic Sports (see vol. iii. p. 12) into England and America commenced in 1860 the popularity of amateur running races has vastly increased. These contests are governed by the rules of the Amateur Athletic Association. At Sheffield a code of rules has been drawn up for the regulation of the more important professional handicaps.
