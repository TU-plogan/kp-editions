RUDE, François (1784-1855), a French sculptor of great natural talent and force of character, but of an ignorance as to all that did not immediately concern his art which can best be described as out of date. He was born at Dijon, 4th January 1784, and came therefore in his youth under the influence of the democratic and Napoleonic ideals in their full force. Till the age of sixteen he worked at his father’s trade as a Stovemaker, amusing himself with modelling in his free hours only; but in 1809 he went up to Paris from the Dijon school of art, and became a pupil of Castellier, obtaining the Great Prize in 1812. After the second restoration of the Bourbons he retired to Brussels, where he got some work under the architect Van der Straeten, who employed him to execute nine bas reliefs in the palace of Tervueren, which he was then engaged in building. At Brussels Rude married Sophie Fremiet, the daughter of a Bonapartist compatriot, to whom he had many obligations, but, obtaining with difficulty work so ill-paid that it but just enabled him to live, he gladly availed himself of the opportunity of return to Paris, where in 1827 a statue of the Virgin for St Gervais and a Mercury Fastening his Sandals obtained much attention. His great success dates, however, from 1833, when he received the cross of the Legion of Honour for his statue of a Neapolitan Fisher Boy playing with a Tortoise, which also procured for him the important commission for all the ornament and one bas relief of the Arc de l’Étoile. This relief, a work full of energy and fire, immortalizes the name of Rude. Amongst other productions, we may mention the statue of Monge, 1848, Jeanne d’Arc (in garden of Luxembourg), 1852, a Calvary in bronze for the high altar of St Vincent de Paul, 1855, as well as Hebe and the Eagle of Jupiter, Love Triumphant, and Christ on the Cross, all of which appeared at the Salon of 1857 after his death. He had worked all his life long with the most extraordinary energy and given himself no rest in spite of the signs of failing health, and at last, on the 3d November 1855, he died suddenly with scarcely time to cry out. One of his noblest works, and easily accessible, is the tomb of Cavaignac, on which he placed beside his own the name of his favourite pupil Christophe. Although executed in 1840, this was not erected at Montmartre till the year after Rude’s own death. His Louis XIII., a life size statue, cast in silver, is to be seen at the Duc de Luynes’s chateau at Dampierre. Cato of Utica stands in the gardens of the Tuileries, and his Baptism of Christ decorates a chapel of the Madeleine.
