RUDOLPH I. (1218-1291), German king, eldest son of Albert IV., count of Hapsburg, was born on the 1st May 1218. By marriage and in other ways he greatly extended his hereditary dominions, so that when he became king he was lord not only of Hapsburg but of the counties of Kyburg and Lenzburg and of the Iandgraviate of Alsace. At different times he carried on war with the bishop of Strasburg, the abbot of St Gall, and the city of Basel. He was engaged in his second struggle with Basel in 1273 when Frederick, burgrave of Nuremberg, brought the intelligence that he had been elected to the German crown. Basel at once submitted, and Rudolph went to Aix-Ia-Chapelle, where he was crowned on the 28th October 1273. The princes had become so independent during the Great Interregnum that they would have preferred to have no supreme ruler; but Pope Gregory X. had threatened that if they did not elect a king he would himself appoint one. The pope now cordially supported Rudolph, who proved to be much more energetic than the electors had anticipated. Having secured the friendship of the palsgrave Louis and Duke Albert of Saxony by allowing them to marry his daughters, he advanced against Ottocar, king of Bohemia, and Henry, duke of Bavaria, both of whom had refused to do him homage. Henry was soon won over to the new king’s side, and then Ottccar had to sue for peace. His request was granted only on condition that he should cede Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and Carniola. By and by Ottocar again rebelled, and was slain in 1278 in a battle fought on the Marchfield. Rudolph gave Bohemia and Moravia to Wenceslaus, OttocaFs son; but Austria, Styria, and Carniola he granted to his own sons, Albert and Rudolph. Carinthia was given to Meinhard, count of Tyrol, who agreed that if his descendants in the male line died out the land should pass to Rudolph’s family. Rudolph compelled Otho, count of Upper Burgundy, and other nobles, who tried to make themselves independent of the German crown, to acknowledge his supremacy; and he recovered certain fiefs in what is now Switzerland, which had been seized by the count of Savoy. He also restored peace in Bohemia, and gave his daughter in marriage to the young king, Wences-laus. He often visited troubled parts of the kingdom, settling local disputes, and destroying the towers of robber barons. On the whole, his rule was a beneficent one, but he did not succeed in re-establishing the authority of the Crown, nor did he see how great an element of strength he might have found in an alliance with the cities. The electors he was forced to confirm in the possession of important rights, which were maintained under his successors. His reign is memorable chiefly because he was the founder of the greatness of the house of Hapsburg. In 1281 his first wife died, and in 1284 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Hugo IV., duke of Burgundy. He died at Germersheim on the l5th July 1291.
