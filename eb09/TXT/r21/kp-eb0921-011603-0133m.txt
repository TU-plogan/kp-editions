RYCAUT or Ricaut, Sir Paul (d. 1700), traveller and diplomatist, was the tenth son of Sir Peter Ricaut, a Royalist who on account of his support of King Charles had to pay a composition of .Â£1500. The son was admitted a scholar of Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1647, and took his B. A. degree in 1650. After travelling in Europe and in various parts of Asia and Africa, he in 1661 accompanied as secretary the earl of Winchelsea, ambassador extraordinary to Turkey. During a residence there of eight years he wrote The Present State of the Ottoman Empire, in three books; containing the Maxims of the Turkish Politic, their Religion and Military Discipline (1670; 4th ed., 1686; Fr. transl. by Briot, 1670; and another with notes by Bespier, 1677). In 1663 he pub[9:21:117]lished at Constantinople The Capitulation, Articles of Peace, &c., concluded between the King of England and the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. Subsequently he was for eleven years consul at Smyrna, and at the command of Charles II. wrote The Present State of the Greek and Armenian Churches, Anno Christi 1678, which on his return to England he presented to the king and published in 1679.
