EILENBURG, a town of Prussia, in the province of Saxony, government of Merseburg, and circle of Delitzsch, is situated on an island formed by the Mulde, about 18âˆ£ mile3 north-east of Leipsic. The principal structures are the hospital, the infirmary, three churches, and the castle. From the last-mentioned, formerly known as Ilburg, and in the time of Henry the Fowler an important post of defence against the Sorbs and Wends, the town received its name. The industries include the manufacture of chemicals, cloth, quilting, calico, cigars, and agricultural implements, bleaching, dyeing, wax-refining, brick-making, and trade in cattle. In the neighbourhood is the iron-foundry of Erwinhof. The population was 10,312 in 1875.
