ECBATANA (Greek, ’ Εκβaτava), or, as it is found in Aeschylus, Άγβάτανα, a name applied by the classical writers to several and possibly to no fewer than seven distinct sites,—the capital of Media Atropatene, the capital of Media Magna, the citadel of Persepolis, a Syrian city on Mount Carmel, the Assyrian castle of Amadiyah, the Arsacidan stronghold of Europus, and the city of Ispahan. This diversity of application doubtless arises from the fact that the word was a descriptive epithet; but its derivation has not been ascertained, and it is even possible that under the Greek disguise we may have two totally distinct originals. According to the usual hypothesis the meaning is treasury or place of assemblage, from the Old Persian hagmaian. The Median use of the name is the only one of special moment, involving, as it does, a difficult question of identification. It has long been admitted on all hands that the modern Hamadan, a town of Persia at the foot of the Elvend Mountains, occupies the site and preserves the name of the great city of Ecbatana, which was the summer residence of the Persian kings from the time of Darius Hystaspis to the Greek conquest, and afterwards became the capital of the Parthian empire. But the further identification of this Ecbatana with the Ecbatana of Herodotus, still maintained by some authorities, has been disputed by Sir Henry Rawlinson, who locates the latter city at Takht-i-Suleiman, a conical hill about half-way between Hamadan and Tabriz, which agrees in its main topographical features with the Herodotean description, and is still covered with extensive ruins of ancient date. There it was at least possible for the Median monarch Deioces to surround his palace with seven concentric walls of different colours, rising one behind the other; but, if the site of Hamadan be adopted, this part of the account, recently shown by the similar arrangement at Borsippa to be so probable in itself, must be relegated to the region of myths. One or other of the cities is possibly mentioned in the Old Testament as Achmatha or Amatha; in the Apocrypha the name frequently occurs in the form of Ekbatana.

See Sir Henry Rawlinson’s “Memoir on the site of the Atropa-tenian Ecbatana,” in <7oum. of the Roy. Geogr. Soc., 1841; Canon G. Rawlinson’s Herodotus, vol. i. 1875, p. 226.
