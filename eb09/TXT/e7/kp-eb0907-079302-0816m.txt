EKATERINODAR, the chief town of the Russian government of Kuban, on the right bank of the Kuban, near the confluence of the Karasuk, in 45° 3' N. lat. and 38° 30" E. long., 1400 miles from St Petersburg and 555 north-west of Tiflis. It is badly built on a swampy site exposed to the inundations of the river; and its houses, with few exceptions, are slight structures of wood and plaster. Six churches, a gymnasium, two schools, and a hospital are the principal public buildings. None of the industrial establishments, which comprise soap-w orks, tanneries, brick-works, and potteries, are of more than local importance; but there is a fair trade in horses, cattle, sheep, wool, and fish. In the neighbourhood is a large garden and orchard maintained by the Government for the encouragement of horticulture. The town dates from the reign of Catherine IL, wdιen in 1792 the Zaporogian Cossacks were transferred to the Kuban district. In 1860 the population amounted to 9620, mainly Cossacks; in 1871 it was 17,622.
