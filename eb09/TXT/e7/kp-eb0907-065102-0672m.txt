EDEN, Hebrew (∏P, denoting pleasure or delight), was the first residence of Adam and Eve according to the Old Testament Scriptures. The passage in which its geographical position seems tobe indicated (Gen. ii. 8-14) has been from the earliest times the subject of a discussion as ingenious and elaborate as it has been fruitless. Its [9:7:652] general position is given as “eastward,” i.e., to the east of the place where the narrative was written. Of the four rivers mentioned the Euphrates is undoubtedly the same which is still known by that name, and the Hiddekel has been almost universally identified with the Tigris. The object of commentators who have sought to put a literal construction on the passage has, therefore, been to identify the Pison and the Gihon, by finding two rivers which together with the Euphrates and the Tigris fulfil the condition stated in Gen. ii. 10, “Aud a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted and became into four heads.” As there is no river which forms a common source for the Euphrates, the Tigris, and two others, recourse has been had to a straiued construction of one kind or other. Josephus, for example, supposes the river which is the common source to have been the ocean stream which surrounds the earth, and identifies the Pison with the Ganges and the Gilιon with the Nile; and in this he is followed by many of the fathers. Calmet, Rosenmüller, and others, again, suppose the river which is the common source to have been a region of springs, and, by making the Pison and the Gilιon mountain streams, place the site of Eden in the highlands of Armenia. Calvin, Huet, and Bochart place Eden in lower Babylonia, on the supposition that the Pison and the Gihon are the two channels by which the united rivers Euphrates and Tigris enter the Persian Gulf. Luther and others, such as Clericus and more recently Baumgarten, have hazarded the supposition that the flood altered the course of the streams, and thus rendered it impossible to identify the locality of Eden from the description given in Genesis. These may suffice as specimens of the almost innumerable solutions that have been offered of what is now generally admitted to be an insoluble problem. On the theory that the narrative in Genesis is veritable history to be literally interpreted, it is impossible to fix the geographical position of Eden with any approach to certainty. This impossibility fully accounts for the immense variety of the conjectures that have been put forward. It deserves mention as a curiosity of criticism that the site o'f Eden has been assigned by different writers to each of the four quarters of the globe, and that the particular localities specified have ranged from Scandinavia to the South Sea Islands. The allegorical interpretations, which have been offered in great variety from the time of Philo downwards, are, of course, not hampered with any geographical difficulties. Philo supposes Eden to be a symbol of the soul that delights in virtue, the river which is the source to be generic virtue or goodness, and the four rivers to be the specific virtues of prudence, temperance, courage, and justice. Origen finds in the subject an excellent opportunity for applying his favourite allegorical method, and supposes Eden to be heaven, and the rivers wisdom. Similar interpretations, with individual variations, are given by several of the fathers who are prone to allegorize. In modern times Coleridge is perhaps the most celebrated of those who have interpreted the story of Eden as an allegory. It is to be observed, however, that this mode of explaining the narrative has found even less favour with recent interpreters than that which accepts it as literal history, meeting the obvious difficulties as best it can. The undoubted tendency of later criticism has been to discard alike the theory of literal history and the theory of allegory in favour of another, according to which the story of Eden is a mythical tradition of a kind similar to that which is to be found in the early sacred literature of most nations. According to this view the true explanation is to be sought for in a careful comparison of these various traditions as preserved in sacred scriptures, early histories, inscriptions, and otherwise. See Adam, vol. i. p. 135-6, and Pentateuch.
