EGLINTON, Archibald William Montgomerie, thirteenth Earl of (1812-1861), lord lieutenant of Ireland, was born at Palermo, September 29, 1812. He was the grandson of Hugh, the twelfth earl, and only son of Archibald, Lord Montgomerie, who at the time of his sonâ€™s birth held a diplomatic post in Sicily. He was only in his eighth year when he succeeded to the title and estates on the death of his grandfather, in December 1819. The young earl was educated at Eton College; and for some time his chief object of interest was the turf. He had a large racing stud, and won success and a reputation in the sporting world. In 1839 his name became more widely known in connection with a tournament which he projected, and which was held at his seat in August of that year. At this attempted revival of mediaeval pageantry, one of the knights was Prince Louis Napoleon, afterwards emperor of the French. The earl of Eglinton was a staunch adherent of the Conservative party, and, on the formation of the first Derby administration in February 1852, he was called from his comparative retirement to fill the office of lord lieutenant of Ireland. He retired with the ministry in the following December, having by the manliness of his character, his affability, and his princely hospitality made himself one of the most popular of Irish viceroys. On the return of the earl of Derby to office in February 1858, the earl of Eglinton was again appointed lord lieutenant, and discharged the duties of this post till June 1859. Before his second retirement he was created earl of Winton in the peerage of the United Kingdom. He had been elected in 1852 lord rector of Glasgow University. The earl was twice married; first, in 1841, to Theresa, widow of Captain R. H. Cockerell, R.N., by whom he had four children. The countess died in December 1853; and in 185S the earl married the Lady Adela Capel, only daughter of the earl of Essex. He lost his second wife in December 1860, and died suddenly himself at St Andrews, October 1, 1861. He was succeeded in the earldom by his eldest son, Archibald William, Lord Montgomerie.
