ECKHEL, Joseph Hilarius (1737-1798), one of the most distinguished numismatists, was born at Enzersfeld in Lower Austria, January 13, 1737. His father was farm-steward to Count Zinzendorf, and he received his early education at the Jesuit’s College, Vienna. Here at the age of fourteen he was admitted into the order, still pursuing his studies with earnestness, and especially devoting himself to antiquities and numismatics. After being engaged as professor of poetry and rhetoric, first at Steyer and afterwards at Vienna, he was appointed in 1772 keeper of the cabinet of coins at the Jesuit’s College, and in the same year he went to Italy for the puιpose of personal inspection and study of antiquities and coins. At Florence he was employed to arrange the collection of the grand duke of Tuscany; and the first fruits of his study of this and other collections appeared in his Hurni Veteres Anecdoti, published in 1775. On the dissolution of the order of Jesuits in 1773, Eckhel was appointed by the empress Maria Theresa professor of antiquities and numismatics at the university of Vienna, and this post he held for twenty-four years. He was in the following year made keeper of the imperial cabinet of coins, and in 1779 appeared his Catalogus Vindobonensis Humorum Veterum. EckheΓs great work is the Doctrina Humorum Veterum, in 8 vols., the first of which was published in 1792, and the last in 1798. The author’s rich learning, comprehensive grasp of his subject, admirable order and precision of statement in this masterpiece drew from Heyne enthusiastic praise, and the acknowledgment that Eckhel, as the Coryphaeus of numismatists, had, out of the mass of previously loose and confused facts, constituted a true science. A volume of Addenda, prepared by Steinbüchel from Eckhel’s papers after his death, was published in 1826. Among the other works of this great scholar are— Choix de Pierres gravées du Cabinet Imperial des Antiques (1788), a useful school-book on coins entitled Kurzgefasste Anfangsgründe zur alten Numismatik (1787), of which a French version enlarged by Jacob appeared in 1825, &c. Eckhel died at Vienna, May 16, 1798.
