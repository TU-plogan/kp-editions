EICHENDORFF, Joseph, Freiherr von (1788-1857), a German poet and romauce-writer, was born at Lubowitz, near Ratibor, in Prussia. He studied law at Halle and Heidelberg from 1805 to 1808. After a visit to Paris he went to Vienna, where he resided until 1813, when he joined the Prussian army as a volunteer. When peace was concluded in 1815 he left the army, and in the following year he was appointed to a judicial office at Breslau. He subsequently held similar offices at Dantzic, Königsberg, and Berlin. Retiring from the public service in 1844, he afterwards resided successively in Dantzic, Vienna, Dresden, and Berlin. He died at Neisse on the 26th November 1857. Eichendorff was one of the most distinguished of the later members of the German romantic school. His genius was essentially lyrical, and he was deficient in the distinctive dramatic faculty. On this account he is most successful in his shorter romances and dramas, where constructive power is least called for. His first work, a romance entitled Ahnung und Gegenwart, appeared in 1815. This was followed at short intervals by several others, among which' the foremost place is by general consent assigned to Aus dem Lehen eines Taugenichts (Berlin, 1824), which has often been reprinted. Of his dramas may be mentioned Ezzelin von Romano, a tragedy (1828); Meierbeths Gluck und Ende, a tragedy (1828); and Die Freier, a comedy (1833). He also translated Calderon’s Geistliche Schauspiele (1846) from the Spanish. Eichendorff⅛ lyric poems were of a very high order, and many of them were set to music by composers of eminence. In the later years of his life he published several valuable works on subjects in literary history and criticism, such as Ueber die ethische und religiose Bedeutung der neueren romantischen Poesie in Deutschland (1847), Der deutsche Boman des 18. Jahrhundert in seinem Verhciltniss zum Christenthum (1851), and Geschichte der poetischen Literatur Deutschlands (1S56). An edition of his collected works in six volumes appeared at Leipsic in 1870.
