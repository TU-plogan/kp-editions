EGG, Augustus Leopold (1816-1863), a painter, was born on 2d May 1816, in Piccadilly, London, where his father carried on business as a gun-maker. He had some schooling at Bexley, and was not at first intended for the artistic profession; but, developing a faculty in this line, he entered in 1834 the drawing class of Mr Sass, and in 1835 the school of the Royal Academy. His first exhibited picture appeared in 1837 at the Suffolk Street Gallery. Iu 1838 he began exhibiting in the Academy, his subject being a Spanish Girl; altogether he sent twenty-seven works to this institution. In 1848 he became an associate, and in 1860 a full member, of the Academy. In 1857 he took a leading part in selecting and arranging the modern paintings in the Art-Treasures Exhibition in Manchester. His constitution being naturally frail, he went in 1853, with Dickens and Wilkie Collins, to Italy for a short trip, and in 1863 he visited Algeria. Here he benefited so far as his chronic lung-disease was concerned; but, riding out one day exposed to a cold wind, he caught an attack of asthma, which cut him off on 26th March 1863, at Algiers, near which city his remains were buried.

Egg was a gifted and well-trained painter of genre, chiefly in the way of historical anecdote, or of compositions from the poets and novelists. As years progressed, he developed in seriousness of subject-matter and of artistic treatment; and at the time of his death he might be ranked among our best painters in his particular class—clever, skilled, and observaut—although he had not any marked originality of point of view or of style. Among his principal pictures may be named :—1843, the Introduction of Sir Piercie Shafton and Halbert Glendinning (from Scott’s Monastery); 1846, Buckingham Rebuffed; 1848, Queen Elizabeth discovers she is no longer young; 1850, Peter the Great sees Catharine for the first time; 1854, Charles I. raising the Standard at Nottingham (a study); 1855, the Life and Death of Buckingham; 1857 and 1858, two subjects from Thackeray’s Esmond; 1858, Past and Present, a triple picture of a faithless wife; 1859, the Night before Naseby; 1860, his last exhibited work, the Dinner Scene from The Taming of the Shrew. The National Gallery contains one of his earlier pictures, Patricio entertaining two Ladies, from the Diable Boiteux; it was painted in 1844.

Egg was rather below the middle height, with dark hair and a handsome well-formed face; the head of Peter the Great (in the picture of Peter and Catharine, which may be regarded as his best work, along with the Life and Death of Buckingham) was studied, but of course considerably modified, from his own countenance. He was manly, kind-hearted, pleasant, and very genial and serviceable among brother-artists; social and companionable, but holding mainly aloof from fashionable circles. As an actor he had uncommon talent. He appeared among Dickens’s company of amateurs, in 1852 in Lord Lytton’s comedy Not so Pad as we Seem, and afterwards in Wilkie Collins’s Frozen Deep, playing the humorous part of Job Want.
