EGEDE, Paul (1708-1789), son of the preceding, accompanied his father to Greenland, assisted him in his labours there, and acted as his successor from 1734 to 1740. On his return to Denmark he became professor of theology in the mission seminary, and afterwards was superintendent of the Greenland mission. He published a Greenland-Danish-Latin Dictonary (1750), Greenland Grammar (1760), and Greenland Catechism (1756). In 1766 he completed the translation, begun by his father, of the New Testament into the Greenland tongue; and in 1787 he translated Thomas Ã  Kempis. In 1789 he published a journal of his life in Greenland.
