ECCARD, Johannes (1553-1611), a celebrated composer of church music, was born at Mühlhausen on the Unstrut, Prussia, in 1553. After having received his first musical instruction at home, he went, at the age of eighteen, to Munich, where he became the pupil of Orlando Lasso, one of the greatest masters of the Franco-Belgian school. In his company Eccard is said to have visited Paris, but in 1574 we find him again at Mühlhausen, where he resided for four years, and edited, together with Johann von Burgk, his first master, a collection of sacred songs, called Crepundia sacra Helmboldi (1577). Soon afterwards he obtained an artistic appointment in the house of Jacob Fugger, the great Augsburg banker, and in 1583 he became assistant conductor, and twelve years later first chapel-master, at Königsberg in Prussia. In 1608 he received a call to Berlin as chief conductor of the elector’s chapel, but this post he held only for three years, owing to his premature death in 1611. Eccard’s works consist exclusively of vocal compositions, such as songs, sacred cantatas, and chorales for four or five, and sometimes for seven, eight, or even nine voices. Their polyphonous structure is a marvel of art, and still excites the admiration of musicians. At the same time his works are instinct with a spirit of true religious feeling. They have indeed a religious and historic significance beyond their artistic value. The important position of music in the service of the Reformed churches is well known. It was derived from, and therefore appealed again to, the feelings of the people. Luther himself recognized the elevating influence of the art by [9:7:622] cultivating it with zeal and success. His setting of the beautiful words “Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott” is still regarded by the Germans as their representative national hymn. Eccard and his school are in the same way inseparably connected with the history of the Reformation. Of Eccard’s songs a great many collections are extant; for an enumeration of the old and rare editions the reader is referred to the works by Winterfeldt, who has devoted great care to the study of Eccard, and by Döring (Choralkunde, p. 47).
