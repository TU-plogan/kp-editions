EKATERINBURG, or Yekaterinburg, a town of Asiatic Russia, at the head of a department in the province of Perm, on the Siberian highway, about 238 miles to the south-east of Perm, in 56° 49' N. lat. and 60° 35 E. long. It is situated near the eastern skirt of the Ural Mountains, and occupies both banks of the Isset, which is there crossed by a dam and forms a valuable reservoir for industrial purposes. In 1834 it was made the seat of a suffragan bishop, and it has long been the head-quarters of the administration of the mines, not only for the immediate neighbourhood, but also for the Bogosloff, Goroblagodat, Perm, Zlato-ustoff, and Kam-Votkin districts. The streets are broad aud regular, and several of the houses of palatial proportions. There are two cathedrals—St Catherine’s founded in 1758, and Epiphany in 1774, with more than adozen churches and a monastery, two gymnasiums, a departmental school, a city infirmary, a workmen’s hospital, an almshouse, a children’s home, a prison, a theatre, and a museum opened in 1853. Besides the Government mint for copper coinage, which dates from 1735, the Government engineering works, and the imperial factory for the polishing of malachite, jasper, marble, porphyry, aud other ornamental stones, the industrial establishments comprise tallowfactories, soap-works, glue-works, rope-works, distilleries, potteries, and carriage factories. The trade is very extensive, especially in cattle, grain, iron, woollen and silk stuffs, and colonial wares; and besides a weekly market there are two annual fairs. The population in 1860 numbered 19,832’, mostly belonging to the Greek Church, only 47 being Catholics, 198 Protestants, and 36 Mahometans; in 1871 it had increased to 25,233.

Ekaterinburg took its origin from the mining establishments founded on the spot by Peter I. in 1723, and received its name in honour of Catharine I. Its development was greatly promoted in 1763 by the Siberian highway, which till then had passed by Verkhoturie, being diverted so as to pass through it; and the gradual extension of mining operations in the district has maintained its prosperity. In 1781 the town was transferred from the Tobolsk department to the government of Perm, and in 1863 passed from the jurisdiction of the Administration of Mines to the ordinary civil jurisdiction.
