EDESSA, or, as it is now called, Urfa or Orfa, a city of Northern Mesopotamia, on the Daisun, a left-hand tributary of the Euphrates, 75 miles W. of Diarbekir and 59 E. of Biredjik, in 37° 2Γ N. lat. and 39° 6' E. long. It is surrounded with walls and towers, well preserved on the northern side, has narrow but comfortable and cleanly [9:7:653] streets, and displays in its bazaar not only the native woollen stuffs, pottery, and silver work, but also a considerable variety of European goods. In the principal square there is a large mosque dedicated to Abraham, who, according to Mahometan legend, was slain in the city; and in its immediate vicinity is a pond shaded by fine pomegranate, plain, and cypress trees, and tenanted from time immemorial by sacred fish. The only ancient remains are those of a tower ascribed by tradition to Nimrod; but in the neighbourhood there exist extensive catacombs with numerous inscriptions of an early date. The prevailing language is Turkish, though more than three-fourths of the inhabitants are Christian. The population was estimated about 1796 by Olivier as from 20,000 to 24,000; by Buckingham at 50,000; and, in 1873, by Chernik at 40,000. There are two mission establishments, an American and a French, and in connection with the former a school with about 250 pupils. The outskirts are occupied by melongardens, vineyards, and mulberry plantations.

Nothing is known of the origin of Edessa. It has been suggested that probably the early inhabitants were Sabaeans, and that the sacred fish originally belonged to the worship of Atergatis. According to the Targum of the pseudo-Jonathan, Jerome, and Ephraem Syrus, the city is to be identified with the Erech of Genesis x.

10, and the local tradition of the Arabs and Jews makes it the same as Ur of the Chaldees; but there is no historical basis for either identification, though the former has received the support of Michaelis, Buttmann, and Von Bohlen. The first authentic mention of the city connects it with Seleucus, who appears to have greatly increased its prosperity, and was probably the bestower of the name by which it is best known in history. This, according to Stephanus, was taken from the Macedonian Edessa, from the abundance of the water in both cities, but a modern etymologist recognizes the Syrian Haditha or New Town. Another designation, Callirhoe, found in the ancient writers, undoubtedly alludes to its fountain; and it is at least possible that this may be the derivation of its modern name—Urlιoi among the Syrians, Er Roha among the Arabs, and Orfa among the Turks and Christians. In the time of Antiochus VII., about 135 b.o., the city became the seat or centre of the Osrhoenic kingdom, founded by Orhoi-Bar-Khevyo, and governed for centuries by a series of elective monarchs. Of these the eighth in succession, Abgar Bar-Abgar, fought against Lucullus, but afterwards sided with the Romans; the fifteenth Abgar Uchomo is famous for the legendary correspondence with Christ reported by Eusebius. The city was plundered by Trajan’s general Lusius Quietus, and the kingdom became tributary in 116. Restored by Hadrian it was finally abolished by Caracalla in 217, and a Roman military colony was established with the title of Colonia Marcia Edessorum. Meanwhile Christianity had been taking fast root in the city, the first church having been built as early at least as 202. By the time of Julian, the wealth of the Christians was sufficient to attract his revengeful cupidity; and in the course of the following century, the number of monasteries alone .is said to have exceeded 300. Great theological schools were established, and the city, in fact, became one of the chief seats of Oriental learning. Most famous of all was the Schola Persica or Persian School; but its professors having adopted the Nestorian heresy were expelled by Martyrus the bishop, and the building was destroyed in 489, and replaced by St Mary’s Church. The prosperity of the city gradually disappeared during the next five centuries, as it passed successively into the hands of the Arabs and the Seljuks. From the latter it was captured in 1097 by Baldwin de Bouillon, and for the next fifty years it continued an independent Christian countship. Baldwin’s successors were his cousin Baldwin

11. (1100-1118), Jocelin de Courtenay, surnamed the Great (1118- 1131), and Jocelin II. (1131-1144). The negligence of this last count permitted the city to fall into the hands of Zengi of Mosul, and in 1466, the attempt of the inhabitants to recover their independence brought down the vengeance of Zengi’s successor Nur-eddin. The sultans of Egypt and Syria obtained possession in 1181, the Byzantines in 1234, the Mongolians under Tamurlane about 1393, the Turkomans and the Persians at a later date, and finally the Turks in 1637.
