EDEN, The Honourable Emily (1795-1851), novelist and miscellaneous writer, was the seventh daughter of the first Lord Auckland, and was born in 1795. Happily gifted by nature, heι , literary faculties and tastes were fostered by a liberal education. In 1835 she accompanied her brother, Lord Auckland, to India, on his appointment as governor-general, and remained with him during his term of office, which covered the period of the Afghan war. Returning to England in 1841, she made herself favourably known as a writer by the publication, three years later, of her Portraits of the Princes and People of India. She was also author of two novels entitled the The Semi-detached House and The Semi-attached Couple, which first appeared anonymously under the editorship of Lady Theresa Lewis. In these works she gives clever and amusing delineations of Anglo-Indian life and manners as she saw them. In 1866 was published a. series of her letters to her sister written from India, and entitled Up the Country. Her private journal, at present unpublished, is said to be still more attractive and full of sparkling anecdote and graphic sketches. Another volume entitled Letters from India, edited by her niece, the Pion. Eleanor Eden, was published in 1872. For many years Miss Eden lived at Kensington, and her house was one of the most frequented centres of London intellectual and fashionable life. She afterwards removed to Richmond, and there died, August 5, 1869. Her eldest sister Eleanor attracted the warn’ affection of William Pitt, who, however, did not feel justified in making her an offer of marriage. This was, it is supposed, the only love-passage in Pitt’s history. She afterwards married Lord Hobart, and died in 1851.
