EAR-RING, an ornament worn pendent from the ear, and generally suspended by means of a ring or hook passing through the pendulous lobe of the ear. The general usage appears to have been to have ear-rings worn in pairs, the two ornaments in all respects resembling each other; in ancient times, or sometimes more recently among Oriental races, a single ear-ring has sometimes been worn. The use of this kind of ornament, which constantly was of great value and sometimes was made of large size, dates from the remotest historical antiquity, the earliest mention of ear-rings occurring in the book of Genesis. It appears probable that the ear-rings of Jacob’s family, which he buried with his strange idols at Bethel, were regarded as amulets or talismans, such unquestionably being the estimation in which some ornaments of this class have been held from a very early period, as they still are held in the East Among all the Oriental races of whom we have any accurate knowledge, the Hebrews and Egyptians excepted, ear-rings always have been in general use by both sexes; while in the West, as well as by the Hebrews and Egyptians, as a general rule they have been considered exclusively female ornaments. By the Greeks and Romans also ear-rings were worn only by women; and the prevalence of this fashion among the races of classic antiquity is illustrated in a singular manner by the ears of the famous statue of the Venus de’ Medici being bored, evidently for the reception of pendent jewels. Ear-rings invariably occupy important positions among the various remains of ancient and mediaeval goldsmiths’ work that from time to time have rewarded the researches of archaeological inquirers. And these early relics, with rare exceptions objects of great beauty and delicacy, never fail to exemplify the artistic styles of their periods, as they were prevalent among the races by whom each individual jewel was produced. Ear-rings of costly materials and elaborate workmanship have been brought to light in considerable numbers in the Troad and in Peloponnesus by Dr Schliemann; jewels of the same class, of exquisite beauty, and of workmanship that is truly wonderful, have been rescued from the sepulchres of ancient Etruria and Greece by Signor Castellani; other ear-rings of gold of characteristic forms have come down to our own times from the ancient Egyptians; we know well what styles of ear-rings were worn by the Romans of the empire and by the early Scandinavians; and recent researches among the burial places of our Anglo-Saxon predecessors in the occupancy of this island have led to the discovery of jewels in considerable numbers, which among their varieties include ear-rings executedin a style that proves the Anglo-Saxons to have made no inconsiderable advance in the arts of civilization. These same ornaments, which never have fallen into disuse, enjoy at the present day a very high degree of favour; like all other modern jewels, however, the ear-rings of our own times as works of arts can claim no historical attributes, because they consist as well of reproductions from all past ages and of every race as of fanciful productions that certainly can be assigned to no style of art whatever.
