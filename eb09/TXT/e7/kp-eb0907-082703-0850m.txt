ELDER, the name of an office both in the Jewish and in the Christian church, which is used in modern times only by Presbyterians. As first applied, among the ancient Jews, for example, it had no doubt a literal fitness, indicating the responsibility and authority that naturally accrue in any community to those advanced in age. As the office gradually came to be fixed in its character and limited in the number of its occupants, the name lost something of its literal fitness, the responsibility and authority becoming attached to it without regard to the age of the occupant. In this respect the kindred terms aiderman, senator, &c., have had a similar history. In the Old Testament usage of the word it is impossible to fix any exact point of time at which it passed from its primary or etymological to its secondary or official sense, as the process was a gradual one, and old age continued to be a leading qualification for the office long after it had ceased to be essential. In Exodus iii. 16 elders are mentioned as a recognized official body among the Israelites, and in subsequent notices (Ex. xix. 7; Ex. xxiv. 1; Deut, xxxi. 9) they appear as the representatives of the whole body of the people. In Numbers xi. 16, 17, seventy ciders, to be chosen out of the entire body, were set apart “to bear the burden of the people” along with Moses. It is unnecessary to enter here into any discussion of the moot question of the connection of this Mosaic council of seventy with large though undefined legislative and executive powers with the Sanhedrim as it existed at the time of Christ. From the time of the institu·. tion of the Mosaic council the elders are mentioned at each successive stage of Jewish history. After the settlement in Canaan they acted as the administrators of the laws in every city (Deut. xix. 11-12; xxi. 3-9, 19; xxii. 15-21); and references to them are frequent during the period of the judges and the kings, during the captivity, and after the restoration. In the New Testament the word is used to denote both an order of the Jewish economy and an office of the Christian church. Its precise significance in the latter usage is the main subject iu the standing controversy between Episcopalians and Presbyterians, and a statement of the arguments on either side belongs properly to the articles on Episcopacy and Presbytery respectively. Reference must also be made to the article on Presbytery for a full statement of the qualifications, duties, and powers of elders in a presbyterian church. It may be noted here that while the New Testament word presbyteros denotes, according to the admission of the adherents of all forms of church government, those especially set apart to the pastoral office, whatever else it may be held to include, its English equivalent elder is used as an official designation only in the presbyterian church. According to the presbyterian theory of church government there are two classes of elders, teaching elders, or those set apart specially to the pastoral office, and ruling elders, who are laymen, chosen generally by the congregation, and set apart by ordination to be associated with the pastor in the oversight and government of the church. When the word is used without any qualification, it is understood to apply to the latter class alone.
