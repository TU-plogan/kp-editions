EGYPT is a country at the north-eastern extremity of Africa, bounded on the N. by the Mediterranean Sea, on the S. by Nubia, on the E. by Palestine, Arabia, and the Red Sea, and on the W. by the Great Desert.

The name of Egypt in hieroglyphics is Kern, which becomes Kemi in demotic, a form preserved in the Coptic KH1ΛE (Sahidic), KHlli (Bashmuric), and (Mem-

phitic), with unimportant variants. The sense is “the black (land),” Egypt being so called from the blackness of its cultivable soil.^[1. C∕. Plut. De Iside et Osiride, cap. 33. Dr Brugsch objects to the idea that Kern may be connected with the biblical patriarchal name Ham DΠ (forming part of poetic names of Egypt in the Psalms:—“the land of Ham,” cv. 23, 27, cvi. 22; “the tents of Ham,” lxxviii. 51), on the ground that it is philologically difficult to connect the Egyptian K with ∏ {Geogr. Inschr., i. p. 74, note*). This objection would be valid were the case one of a Semitic word transcribed in ancient Egyptian; it is not so where we have a root which is common, as this may be, to both (c∕. Bunsen’s Egypt’s Place, v. 757, 758). The meaning of the Hebrew root DΠ is “hot, warm.” The Arabic root signifies “it became hot,” and describes blackness as a result Γ Sio- of heat; and the word isl⅜i⅛ “black mud” also occurs.]

In Hebrew Egypt is called Mizraim, D'.iyP, a dual, sometimes used as a singular.^[2. The use of Mizraim as the proper name of an individual appears to be as early as the time of Ramses II. Màzrima occurs as the name of a Hittite, the brother of the king (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., ii. 25, pl. xviii. 77). The Hebrew dual form is similarly transcribed in Mâhanemâ, Mahanaim (ii. 61, pl. xxiv. 22), a word not actually dual, and the Aramaic dual also in Neharina, the Hebrew Naharaim (i. pl. ix. 333).] It describes the country with reference to its two great natural divisions, Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, or the Delta. In the prophets Mazor, occurs as the singular form, and means Lower Egypt, Pathros being used for Upper Egypt.^[3. Pathros may take its name from the Pathyrite Nome, so called from its metropolis, P-hat-har (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 188, 189, pl. xxvii. 839). As this nonιe contained Thebes, it might have a signification like Thebaïs. De Rougé prefers p-to-res, “the country of the south,” or Upper Egypt. {Six Premières Dynasties, Mém. de tlnst., XXV. ii. 231).] Thus Mizraim may be compared to the two Sicilies, though sometimes we find Mizraim for the lower country where we should expect Mazor. (Gesen. Thes. s. v. Mizraim.) The meaning of Mazor is probably the “fortified,” rather than the “border,” referring to the natural strength of the country.

The Greek Αίγυπτος first occurs in the FIomeric writings. In the Odyssey it is the name of the Nile (masculine) as well as of the country (feminine). Afterwards it is not used for the river. No satisfactory Egyptian^[4. Dr Brugsch has conjecturally identified Αίγυπτο? with Ha-ke-ptah, the sacred name of Memphis, from which the westernmost branch of the Nile, the Canobic, with its two mouths, the Canobic and the Bolbitine, those best known to the early Greeks, seem to have been called {Geogr. Inschr., i. 83).] or Semitic origin has been proposed for it. The probable origin is the Sanskrit root gup, “to guard,” whence may have been formed âgupta, “guarded about,” a similar sense to Mazor.^[5. The apparent relation of Αίγυπτο s to aιγυπιis, a vulture, might seem to suggest a mythological origin for the proper name. Μ. Pictet has, however, most ingeniously traced both to gup, to guard, though his supposition that the name originally was connected with the Shepherd rule in Egypt must be regarded as hazardous {Origines Indo-Européennes, i. 459,seg¾.). It is better to consider it a translation of Mazor, as Ne<λo, of Shihor. ς>]

The Hebrew Mazor is preserved in the Arabic Misr, o pronounced Masr in the vulgar dialect of Egypt.

It occurs in the Korân as the name of Egypt (xliii. 50), but has been applied to the country and to its chief capitals since the Arab conquest, El-Fustât, now called Masr-el- ’Ateekah, or Old Masr, and El-KAhireh, the Cairo of the Europeans.^[6. In the Arabic lexicons is placed under the root which in the second conjugation has the sense “he built cities,” “he o commanded a city should be a capital; but we also find « red mud,” the term used meaning both red and reddish brown.]

By the Greeks and Romans Egypt was usually assigned to Asia, though some gave it to Libya, or Africa. This difference was owing to the adoption of the Nile as the division of the two continents, which would naturally have given half of the country to each continent.

In ancient times Egypt was the country watered by the Nile north of the First Cataract, the deserts on either side being assigned to Arabia and Libya.^[7. Probably the oldest southern boundary was at Silsilis, near Gebel-es-Silsileh.] The Egyptian name, “the black land,” is only applicable to the cultivable laud. The Misr of the Arabs is distinctly restricted to the same territory, the adjoining deserts being called the deserts of Egypt. Physically, ethnographically, and politically, the two tracts are markedly different, but it is now usual to treat them as a single country.

Physical Geography, Productions, and Inhabitants.

The political advantages of Egypt, in situation, natural strength, and resources, can hardly be overrated. It lies in the very route of the trade between Europe and Asia, and that between Africa and the other two continents. It is the gate of Africa, and the fort which commands the way from Europe to the East Indies. The natural ports on the Red Sea and the Mediterranean, selected and improved by the wisdom of Alexander and the Ptolemies, whose enterprises have been eclipsed by those of M. de Lesseps in our own days, have always been enough for its commerce, which the great inland water-way of the Nile has greatly aided. The inhabited country, guarded by deserts and intersected in Lower Egypt by branches of the Nile and canals, in Upper Egypt closely hemmed in by the mountains on either side, is difficult to reach and to traverse; at the same time its extreme fertility makes it independent of supplies from other lands, and thus easier to defend. The ancient wealth and power of Egypt should occasion us no wonder, nor even that the country still prospers in spite of centuries of Turkish misrule.

“The extent of the cultivated land in Egypt [Mr. Lane calculates] to be equal to rather more than one square degree and a half; in other words, 5500 square geographical miles. This is less than half the extent of the land which is comprised within the confines of the desert; for many parts within the limits of the cultivable land are too high to be inundated, and consequently are not cultivated; and other parts, particularly in Lower Egypt, are occupied by lakes, or marshes, or drifted sand. Allowance also must be made for the space which is occupied by towns and villages, the river, canals, &c. Lower Egypt comprises about the same extent of cultivated land as the whole of Upper Egypt.”^[8. Mrs Poole, Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 85,86. Mr Lane “made his calculation from a list of all the towns and villages in Egypt, and the extent of cultivated land belonging to each. This list is appended to Do] Since the date when this was written, [9:7:701] 1844, the extent of cultivated land has increased. This has been chiefly due to works of irrigation in Lower Egypt, the increased cultivation of cotton, and the greater facility of transport. The increase cannot, however, be very large.

Divisions.— The ancient like the modern Egyptians followed the natural division of the country into two tracts, the valley of Upper Egypt and the plain of Lower Egypt. The names in hieroglyphics are to-res, the “south land” (compared, with the article prefixed, p-to-res, to Pathros by Μ. de Rougé), and to-mehit, the “north land.” The two were divided by the southern boundaries of the highest nomes of Lower Egypt, the Memphite and Heliopolite, and thus the political boundary was somewhat south of the position where the valley extends into the plain. The most southern nome of Upper Egypt was called that of Nubia, and began at Silsilis. The Greek and Roman division excludes the Memphite Nome from Lower Egypt.

It is not known at what date Egypt was first divided into the provinces called Nomes. They are noticed in inscriptions of Dynasty IV. (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 93), and their symbol occurs in the name of Hesp-ti, “the two nomes,” fifth king of Dynasty I., Manetho’s Usaphaidos.^[9. Μ. de Rougé has already noticed the possibly commemorative character of two other not much later royal names, *.akau and Bi-n-nuter (Six Prem. Dyn.,2½3, 244), and this may therefore perhaps have been of the same kind.] The hieroglyphic name is hesp. In late inscriptions the term (p-)tesh occurs, which is also the demotic form, and the origin of the Coptic (Z√. i. 94, 95). The number of nomes is somewhat different in the various ancient Egyptian lists, all of which, except fragments, are of the Graeco-Roman age. Probably the number varied at different times. Dr Brugsch conjectures the true number to be forty-two, considering the forty-two judges of the dead {Ritual, ch. 125) as called from the chief towns of the kingdom to a great tribunal {Geogr. Inschr., i. 99), which he thinks represents the earthly court described by Diodorus Siculus (i. 75.)— {Geogr. Iηschr., i. 124.)

There was a double system of names for the nomes,— the sacred, usual in hieroglyphics, and the vulgar, taken from the capitals, and preserved in Greek in transcriptions or translations. In consequence of this double system the identification of the hieroglyphic names with those of the Greeks and Romans is not always certain. This is the case in Lower Egypt, where the form of the country makes it hard to determine the exact geographical relation intended by any order. On account of this difficulty, and because the hieroglyphic names are of inferior importance in the geography of Egypt, they are not here given. (See Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 93, seqq.)

By the Greeks and Romans Egypt w as divided into the Delta or lower country, and the Thebais or upper country. The third division, the so-called Middle Egypt, first occurs in Ptolemy as the Seven Nomes, 'Επτά νοpοl, or Hepta-

nomis, Επταvo∕χ⅛. This new division, and the transfer of the Memphite Nome from Lower Egypt to the Heptanomis. are the chief innovations, for the fanciful divisions of Lower Egypt in Ptolemy are no doubt theoretical.

The following list of the nomes is taken from Parthey’s Vocαbulaηum C optico-Latinum, compared with the same author’s Erdkunde des alten Aegyptens, Berl. Akad., 1858. The authorities are Herodotus, Agatharchides, Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, the coins of the nomes struck under Trajan, Hadrian, and Antoninus Pius, the last indicated by the abbreviation Nu., and other sources. The letters L., H., and T. indicate Lower Egypt, the Heptanomis, and the Thebais, as the divisions to which nomes thus designated are known to belong.
[table]

Sacy’s Abd-Allαtif. It was made in the year of the Flight 777 (a.d. 1375-6), [recording the census of 715, a.d. 1315-6], and may be rather underrated than the reverse. The estimate of Μ. Mengin (Histoire de l'Égypte, ii. 342-344) shows that in 1821 the extent of the cultivated land was much less; but since that period considerable tracts of waste land had been rendered fertile” (Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 85, note). In the Description de l' Égypte there is an excellent memoir on the superficies of that country by Col. Jacotin, who computes the space which the Nile does or can water or fertilize, including its bed, north of the first cataract, at 9582’39 square geographical miles, of which but 5626 - 59 were in a state of cultivation or fit for cultivation. The space actually under cultivation was found by Μ. Esteve to be 5469 - 86 square miles, but it is stated that 2735’07 more may have been anciently cultivable, of which much might be reclaimed. Description de l'Égypte, xviii. ii. 101, seqq. The close agreement of Mr Laue’s estimate with Col. Jacotin’s shows that the bases of both were accurate, and the difference from Μ. Mengin’s maybe explained by the disasters which preceded the establishment of Mehemet Ali as pasha.

It is very remarkable that the Arsinoïte Nome of the Heptanomis does not appear in the hieroglyphic lists, because Sebek, the crocodile-headed divinity there worshipped was, at least in later times, disliked in most parts of Egypt (Brugsch, Hist., 2 ed., 109, 107).

The Notitia Dignitatum, composed under Theodosius IL, a.d. 408-450, gives a new a division of Egypt into four provinces—Aegyptus, Augustamnica, Arcadia, and Thebal’s. Roughly the first comprised all Lower Egypt except the part east of the Delta, which was assigned to the second, and Arcadia appears to have succeeded the Heptanomis (Parthey, Erdkunde, 518, taf. vii.)

About the time of Justinian I. this division is found to be further developed, according to the statements of Hierocles. Egypt contained six eparchies :—1. Egypt Proper, Αιγυπτιακή, the west of Lower Egypt to the Sebennytic branch of the Nile; 2. The First Augusta, Aυγoυστα a', the north-eastern part of Lower Egypt to the Syrian border; 3. The Second Augusta, Αύγουσ-τα β, the territory southward of the First Augusta; 4. Arcadia, ’Αρκαδία, the earlier Heptanomis; 5. The Nearer Thebais, Θτ/βα’ίς g eγytστα, extending to Panos, or Panopolis, and including the Great Oasis; 6. The Upper Thebais, Θηβa⅛ η άνω, as far as Pliilae. The division into nomes had evidently been almost effaced at this time (Id. 520, taf. ix.).

The Copts preserved the oldest division of the country, and called Lower Egypt, the Northern Region, eJL5.ζ l IT (Mem.), Λlgl r Γ, <fcc. (Sah.), Upper Egypt, the Southern Region, pHC (Mem.), ΛΛApHC (Sah.) The names of the nomes were also known to them, and are given by Champoilion in H Égypte sous les Pharaons.

Like the Copts, the Arabs generally know of but two divisions, the names of which are such as the people of the desert would naturally give to the country watered by the Nile.. Lower Egypt is called Er-Reef, the cultivated, or fertile, and Upper Egypt, Es-Sa’eed, the happy, or fortunate.

Under the Memlook sultans of the Bâhree dynasty, as we learn from the list appended to De Sacy’s Abd-Allαtif, referring to a.h. 715 (a.d. 1315-6), the provinces of Egypt were less numerous than the ancient nomes. They are for Lower Egypt—the territory of Cairo and the provinces of Kalyoob, the Sharkeeyeh, the Dakahleeyeh, Ed-Dimyât, the Gharbeeyeh, Menoof, Abyar and Benee-Nasr, the Boheyreh, Fooweh, Nesterawiyeh, Alexandria, and El-Geezeh; and for Upper Egypt—the provinces of Atfeeh, the Feiyoom, Behnesè, Ashmooneyn, Manfaloot, Asyoot, Akhmeem, and Koos. At the time of the French occupation the provinces had been reduced in number to sixteen, and the division of the Middle Provinces introduced, thus reviving the Heptanomis. The Northern Provinces, El-Akaleem el-Bahreeyeh, were the Gharbeeyeh, that of Er-Rasheed, the Boheyreh, that of El-Mansooreh, the Manoo-feeyeh, that of Ed-Dimyât, the Sharkeeyeh, the Kalyoobeeyeh, and that of El-Geezeh. The Middle Provinces, El-Akaleem el-Wustaneeyeh, were that of Atfeeh, the Feiyoom, and those of Benee-Suweyf or Behnesè, and of El-Minyeh or Ashmooneyn.^[10. Μ. Jomard states that the older appellations were used for the two provinces of Benee-Suweyf and El-Minyeh, though these towns had succeeded the earlier chief places after which the provinces were named. —Descr. de l'Egyρte, ix. 594.] The Southern Provinces, El-Akaleem el-Kibleeyeh, were those of Asyoot, Girgà, and Kinè. There is no doubt that these provinces sometimes correspond to the ancient nomes, though generally composed of the territories of more than one. (Cf. Jomard in Descr. de IHgypte, 2d ed. ix. 594, 595.) By Mehemet Ali a new division was formed into districts governed by a mudeer, of which Lower Egypt, including a small portion of the Middle Provinces, contained four, and the rest of Egypt three. At the present time Egypt is divided into fifteen provinces, each governed by a mudeer.

It will be readily understood that much confusion prevails as to the divisions of the country, more especially at times when an arbitrary administrative division has been used side by side with a popular one, depending upon what nature and artificial aids, such as canals and dikes, have done to map out the country.

The general appearance of Egypt is remarkably uniform. The Delta is a level plain richly cultivated, and varied alone by the lofty dark-brown mounds of ancient cities, and the villages in groves of palm-trees, standing on mounds often if not always ancient. We sometimes see groves of palm-trees besides those around the villages, but other trees are, except in some parts, rare. In Upper Egypt the valley is in as rich a state of cultivation, but very narrow and bounded by mountains of no great height, which hem it in. They form the edge of the desert on either side of the valley, which has been cut through a rocky table-land by the river. They rarely take the form of peaks. Sometimes they approach the river in bold promontories, and at others are divided by valleys with the beds of torrents which flow only at very long intervals. The bright green of the fields, the reddish-brown or dull green of the great river, and the tender tints of the bare yellow rocks, beneath the deep blue sky, always form a beautiful view. In form the landscape varies little and is not remarkable; in colouι its qualities are always splendid, and under a general uniformity show continual variety.

Climate.— The climate of Egypt, being remarkably equable, is healthy to those who can bear great heat, and who avoid the unwholesome tracts of the country, such as the [9:7:703] northern coast, where there are extensive salt-marshes. Upper Egypt is healthier than Lower Egypt. The least healthy time of the year is the latter part of autumn, when the inundated soil is drying. In the desert, at a very short distance from the cultivable land, the climate is uniformly dry and unvaryingly healthy. Egypt, however, is unsuitable as a permanent residence to Europeans who do not greatly modify their mode of life;^[11. Beer, wine, and all alcohol should be very sparingly used, and little meat eaten in the hot season.] and it is almost impossible to rear European children there; but if they arrive after the age of ten or a little more they do not usually feel its ill effects.^[12. One resident at Alexandria adopted with success the method of εending her children to sea as soon as any weakness showed itself.] As a resort for invalids Egypt cannot be recommended without caution. Persons suffering from asthma and bronchitis are likely to gain benefit from a Nile-voyage, unless the season is unusually cold. The climate of the desert does not in all cases suit them, the small particles of sand which are inhaled increasing the irritation. The desert air is undoubtedly good for consumption, and a wise plan is to encamp near Cairo, or still better to find some kind of house within the limits of the desert; and there are ancient sepulchral grottoes at Thebes and other sites which afford excellent quarters for any one who will take the pains to build a court and a few rooms in front of them. A Nile-voyage cannot be so safely recommended. The climate on the river itself is more changeable than elsewhere, and often in winter far colder than is good for delicacy of the lungs. No one should visit Egypt in the winter without heavy as well as light clothing.

The atmosphere is remarkably dry and clear, except on the sea-coast; and even the humidity which is the consequence of the spreading of the inundation is scarcely felt but by its rendering the heat more oppressive. Sometimes a white fog, very dense and cold, rises from the river in the morning, but it is of rare occurrence and short duration. The heat is extreme during a great part of the year, but it is chiefly felt when accompanied by the hot winds of spring and the sultry calm of the season of the inundation. The winter is often comparatively severe in its cold, especially as the domestic architecture is intended to protect rather from heat than cold. “The general height of the thermometer in the depth of winter in Lower Egypt, in the afternoon and in the shade is from 50° to 60°; in the hottest season it is from 90° to 100°, and about 10° higher in the southern parts of Upper Egypt” {Mod. Eg., Introd.)

On the coast of the Mediterranean rain is frequent, but in other parts of Egypt very unusual. At Cairo there js generally one heavy storm in the winter, and a shower or two besides, the frequency of rain having increased since the growth of Ibrahim Pasha’s plantations between the city and the river. At Thebes a storm occurs but once in about four years, and light rain almost as rarely.

The wind most frequently blows from the N.W., N., or N.E., but particularly from the first direction. The proportionate prevalence of these winds to those from all the other quarters, in the year, is about 8 to 3; but to those from the S., S E., and S.W., about 6 to 1. (Clot-Bey, Aperçu General sur V Égypte, i. p. 30.) The northerly winds are the famous Etesian winds of Herodotus (ii. 20), which enable boats constantly to ascend the Nile against its strong and rapid current, whereas in descending the river they depend on the force of the stream, the main-yard being lowered. These winds also cool the temperature during the summer months. The southerly winds are often very violent, and in the spring and summer, especially in April and May, hot sand-winds sometimes blow from the south, greatly raising the temperature, and causing especial suffering to Europeans. The famous Simoom, properly called Samoom,^[13. Of the term samoom Mr Lane writes, “In the present day it is commonly applied to a violent and intensely-hot wind, generally occurring in the spring or summer, in Egypt and the Egyptian deserts usually proceeding from the south-east or south-south-east, gradually darkening the air to a deep purple hue, whether or not (according to the nature of the tract over which it blows) accompanied by clouds of dust or sand, and at length entirely concealing the sun; but seldom lasting more than about a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes.” —Arabic Lexicon, s.v., pt. iv. 1420.] is a much more violent hot sand-wind, which is more usual in the desert than in the cultivated tracts, but in either occurring only at long intervals. It is a kind of hurricane, most painful to experience, and injurious in its effects. {Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 96, 97.) The zôbâ’ah is a common but remarkable phenomenon. It is a very lofty whirlwind of sand resembling a pillar, which moves with great velocity. Mr Lane measured some with a sextant, and found them to be between 500 and 700 feet in height, and one to have an altitude of 750 feet. When crossing the Nile a zôbâ’ah frequently capsizes any boat which may be in its way, and of which the main-sheet is tied by the carelessness of the boatmen instead of being held. {Id., loe. cid.; Modern Egyptians, chap, x.) It may be mentioned that a sudden gust of wind from a valley in the mountains is equally dangerous when the sheet is tied, and a third danger is the attempt to move during a southerly gale, when the long shallow Nile-boat is easily caught broadside and capsized.

One of the most interesting phenomena of Egypt is the mirage, which is frequently seen both in the desert and in the waste tracts of uncultivated land near the Mediterranean; and it is often so truthful in its appearance that one finds it difficult to admit the illusion.

Diseases.— Notwithstanding the fineness of the climate, the stranger who visits Egypt is struck by the signs which he sees everywhere of the prevalence of many serious diseases, and in the first half of this century he might have witnessed the effects of a great epidemic of the plague or the cholera. Yet he should remember the poverty of the great mass of the inhabitants and the insufficiency of their food (both due to the selfish rapacity of the Government), the insufficient training of the native medical practitioners, the false system of many of the foreigners established in the country, and the reluctance of the natives to take medical advice. Ophthalmia when neglected is frequently followed by blindness, and dysentery in the same circumstances is very often fatal.

The plague has been the greatest scourge of Egypt. We cannot tell whether the pestilences mentioned by Manetho as having occurred in the reign of one of the most ancient kings were the same as the modern plague; it seems, however, to be alluded to in the Bible as peculiarly Egyptian (Zech. xiv. 18). In 1835 there was an epidemic of plague of extreme severity, during which there died in Cairo a number of the inhabitants equal to the whole adult male population {Modern Egyptians, Introduction). The last occurrence of the disease was in 1843, when the mortality was comparatively insignificant. The immunity which Egypt has enjoyed for more than thirty years, in which interval there would ordinarily have been several plagues, has been attributed to the sanitary measures of the Egyptian Government, and no doubt these may have somewhat contributed to this result. It should, however, be remembered that the plague is always imported into Egypt, and that there have been no severe epidemics of undoubted plague elsewhere in the period.

This disease has usually first appeared in the east and south coasts of the Mediterranean, and part of the north coast, a·nd when epidemic seems to pursue a similar cour.-e to the cholera in advancing steadily from place to place. Tn Egypt it usually appears first at Alexandria in the winter [9:7:704] or spring, and if the earliest cases occur towards the close of the year, one may be sure of a plague of great severity and long continuance. At first the cases are generally few, but they gradually increase, and in the hottest weather attain their maximum. The disease is not long in travelling from Alexandria to Cairo, but it rarely ascends much higher up the river, and has seldom been known at Thebes in modern times. Many medical writers have denied the contagious character of the plague, in particular Clot-Bey, a French physician, who was long chief medical officer of the Egyptian Government, and who published a treatise on the subject (Clot-Bey, De la Peste) ', yet the evidence on the other side is too strong to be rebutted. An epidemic of plague is greatly to be dreaded in the present circumstances of Egypt. Rapid communications would readily bring the disease to Europe, and the interests of commerce would stand in the way of the reasonable precaution of quarantine. It is stated that the plague is endemic in the marshes of Chaldaea. Surely it would be well if the European Governments were to appoint a commission for the investigation of the disease and to ascertain what, if any, is the value of the sanitary measures of the Turkish Government.

Dysentery is an extremely common malady, and causes very large mortality. It may usually be traced to a careless course of diet, and especially to eating uncooked vegetables, unripe fruit, or other unwholesome food, and to drinking brackish water. Mr Lane has published a mode of treatment which has been attended with extraordinary success {Modern Egyptians, App. E. of all later editions). Asiatic cholera visited Egypt in its westward course on the first two occasions of its appearance in Europe. According to the Government returns, which were probably below the truth, nearly 200,000 persons perished from the disease in all Egypt during the great cholera of 1848. It is remarkable that after each of these great epidemics the disease appeared a second time, but with far less destructive results. Among the diseases most dreaded by the European residents is liver-complaint. These who abstain from alcoholic drinks, or use them with extreme moderation, escape the complaint altogether, or suffer from it in a comparatively mild form. Hemorrhoids and herniae are among the commonest maladies. Skin diseases have been at all times very prevalent in Egypt. Leprosy is now well known, but not common, unlike elephantiasis, which in more than one form has numerous victims. Small-pox was formerly very severe, but it has been checked in its virulence by vaccination. The so-called guinea-worm occurs, but it is perhaps not indigenous.

Of the diseases of the eye, ophthalmia is the most formidable, from its prevalence and malignant character; yet perhaps no malady more readily yields to treatment if promptly used. Where the predisposition exists, a slight cause, such as the irritation occasioned by a grain of dust or sand, is enough to produce an inflammation, which, if not checked, inflicts a lasting injury if it does not produce blindness. For this disease Mr Lane has published a very efficacious mode of treatment {Mod. Eg., App. E).

Clot-Bey affirms that pulmonary consumption is extremely rare among the native inhabitants {Aperçu, ii. 372), yet another physician asserted (but not in print) that he had met with not a few cases in a short practice. Asthma and bronchitis are among the common disorders. The occurrence of coup-de-soleil is not unusual, but it is rarely attended with fatal results, probably on account of the sobriety of the people. Madness is common, generally in the form of idiocy. Maniacs alone are confined; idiots are regarded with much respect as saints, and it is probable that some persons feign idiocy to become objects of popular veneration, supported by alms. One of the Memlook sultans, Kaiâoon, following the example of Saladin {Abul fedoe Annales, ed. Reiske, iv. 30, 31) founded a madhouse, or mâristân, at Cairo, which was still used thirty years ago {Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 166). Its inmates were subsequently transferred to a modern hospital. Nervous affections are uncommon, probably owing to the calm life which the inhabitants lead. Rheumatism is of more usual occurrence; but, according to Clot-Bey, gout is unknown {Aperçu, ii. 377). It is well worthy of notice that, although ownerless dogs are very common in Cairo and the other towns, and watch-dogs are kept by the villagers, canine madness and hydrophobia are unknown; but Clot-Bey is probably in error when he says that rabies has never been observed in Egypt {id. ii. 78), for the Coptic prayer-books contain a prayer to be used for a person suffering from hydrophobia,^[14. This is stated on the authority of the late Rev. J. R. T. Lieder of Cairo.] and this is not likely to have been derived from a foreign source. (For an account of the diseases of Egypt, see Clot-Bey’s Aperçu General and De la Peste, and Descr. de l , Égypte, xiii. 29).

Geology.— In considering the geology of Egypt, its deserts claim our first notice. By a desert is generally understood a wide plain of shifting sand; but this is usually an erroneous description of such a tract, and especially inapplicable to the deserts which border the valley of the Nile. These are raised mountain regions, the surface of which is often covered with sand, debris, and pebbles, intersected by valleys, and diversified, in the case of the western desert, by some oases.

On both sides of the Nile the mountains are limestone, until a little above Thebes, where the sandstone commences. At the First Cataract red granite and other primitive rocks burst through the sandstone beneath the bed of the Nile, and for a considerable space on the east, obstructing the course of the river by numerous small islands and rocks, and thus forming the rapids. In several places, chiefly on the eastern side, the mountains approach the river, and sometimes reach it. They are always utterly devoid of vegetation, and, except the granite, generally of a yellowish or reddish colour, though in some places they are greyish. Near the Cataract the sandstone mountains are partially covered with bright yellow sand in drifts. The mountains on both sides neaι∙ the river are usually about 300 feet in height, and rarely much loftier. The highest point on the western bank at Thebes is four times that altitude. If one leaves the river and ascends the mountains, he finds a great rocky tract before him, the only easy paths through which are along valleys often very winding. The eastern desert gradually rises until about midway between the Nile and the Red Sea, where primitive rocks burst through the later formation, and the loftiest of them, a granite mountain called Gebel-Ghareb (about lat. 28°), attains the height of about 6000 feet. In this portion of the desert are porphyry, breccia, and basalt rocks, which were anciently much prized for purposes of architecture and sculpture. The western desert is of a lower elevation, and is principally remarkable for its oases, which are deep valleys containing alluvial soil, but they are little productive except in dates. Their beauty and fertility have been naturally much exaggerated. Notwithstanding the inequalities of their surface, it is evident that the deserts rise towards the Red Sea, attaining their greatest height in the peninsula of Sinai, which is but a continuation of the same tract.

The most remarkable geological change which has been observed to have taken place in Egypt is one still in operation, the depression of the northern shore notwithstanding [9:7:705] the constant deposit of the Nile, and the corresponding elevation of the southern part of the isthmus of Suez. The consequence of this change of level has been the ruin of places on the shore of the Mediterranean, the extension of the salt-marshes, and the drying up of a considerable part of the northernmost portion of the Gulf of Suez. The bed of the Red Sea may be traced for several miles north of Suez, which now stands at the head of the western gulf; and places far north of that town were on the coast in historic times.

The form of the plain and valley inclosed by the deserts is remarkably regular. In Lower Egypt the cultivable land little exceeds the limits of the ancient Delta, but greatly exceeds those of the space between the two remaining branches of the Nile. The northern coast is protected by shoals and a low range of sand-hills. To the south of these are extensive salt marshes and lakes, or waste tracts, and beyond, the cultivated land. The deserts on either side are of low elevation. To the east of the ancient Delta, a valley, the Wâdee-et-Tumeylât, is in course of being reclaimed by the Sweet-Water Canal.

The form of the valley, or Upper Egypt, may be best seen on the map; its leading peculiarities may here be noticed. Its course is nearly north and south until just within the border of the Thebais, when it takes a southeasterly direction as far as the town of Girgà, and then turns due east as far as Kinè, from which town it resumes ts former direction. The mountains and desert on the western side throughout Upper Egypt, that is, above Cairo, are generally further from the river than those on the eastern side, which frequently reach to the water’s edge. The difference is most remarkable as far as the town of Farshoot, by the course of the river about 350 miles above Cairo, and about 70 miles below Thebes. Near Farshoot begins a continuous series of canals, which flow parallel to the Nile, and near the Libyan chain, until they terminate in Lower Egypt, not far north of Cairo. Above Farshoot, the eastern mountains recede as far as a little above Thebes, and the western mountains gradually approach the Nile. Halfway between Thebes and the First Cataract, the cultivable soil is equally narrow on each bank. The greatest breadth of the cultivable land, all of which is not now cultivated, on the western bank seldom exceeds about 8 or 10 miles, and on the eastern bank, about 3 miles, but it is usually much narrower.

There is in Upper Egypt one striking deviation from the uniform character of the country 7 . About 70 miles above Cairo, by the course of the Nile, an opening in the Libyan range leads to a kind of oasis, the Feiyoom, a fertile tract, lying in a hollow of the desert, and having at its further extremity a great lake of brackish water.

The Nile.— The chief natural feature of Egypt is the Nile, and the great phenomenon of the country the yearly inundation. With the ancient inhabitants the river had, according to their usage with such names, its two appellations, sacred and common. The sacred name was Hapi, the same as that of one of the four genii of Amenti (Hades) and of the bull Apis. The probable meaning is “the concealed” (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 77). The profane name was Atur, or Aur, usually with the epithet aä, the great. The two forms, of which the first appears to be the older, the second the younger, mean “river,” as is equally the case with the demotic and Coptic forms of Aur (ΛZ. p. 78). There are at least three names of the Nile in the Bible,—Yeôr p⅛'., * 1 ^,), the same as the Egyptian name last mentioned, and probably of Egyptian derivation; Shichor ("ll∏'Vζ *"ii∏2∖ ^1W√ ’), “the black ;” and “the river θf Egypt,’· Q.'W ’ P *l∏λ The “torrent,” or “brook of Egypt” (O∏YP ⅛}), s p 0k en of as the western limit of Palestine, and so the eastern limit of Egypt, is either a desert stream at Rhιnocorura, now El-’Areesh, or the Pelusiae or easternmost branch of the Nile.^[15. The manner in which this term is used (Num. xxxiv. 5; Josh. xv. 4, 47; 1 K. viii. 65; 2 K. xxiv. 7; Is. xxvii. 12), to designate the boundary of Egypt and Palestine, precisely as Shichor is employed (Josh, xiii. 3; 1 Chr. xiii. 5), would be conclusive as to their identity, were it not that the country between the Pelusiae branch and Rhinô-corura is a waste region, which may have been wholly considered as boundary.]

The Greek and Roman name N∈Γλoς, Nilus, is certainly not traceable to either of the Egyptian names of the river, nor does it seem to be philologically connected with the Hebrew ones. It may be, like Shichor, indicative of the colour of the river, for we find in Sanskrit, Nila, “blue,” probably especially “dark blue,” also even black, as Nilapan·ka, “black mud.” The two great confluents of the Nile are now called the Bahr-el-Abyad, or “White River,” and the Bahr-el-Azrak, or “Blue River,” and the latter most nearly resembles the Nile in Egypt. As already noticed, Αίγυπτος, in the Odyssey, is the name of the Nile (masc.) as well as of the country (fem.).

The Arabs preserved the classical name of the Nile in the MJ Q

proper name En-Neel J. λ λJ1 , or Neel-Misr JuJ, the

Nile of Misr (Egypt). The same word signifies indigo.^[16. “Eη∙Necl is the river (lit. the inundation) of Egypt: Es-Saghânee says—‘ But as to the neel [indigo] with which one dyes, it is an Indian word Arabici zed” (77ιe Hιsbαh of Bl-Feiyoomee}.]

The modern Egyptians commonly call the river El-Bahr, “the sea,” a term also applied to the largest rivers, and the inundation “the Nile,” En-Neel; and the modern Arabs call the river Bahr-en-Neel, “the river Nile.”

The course of the Nile has already been noticedin speaking of the form of the Nile valley. In ancient times the Delta was watered by seven branches; now there are but two, the other ancient branches being canals not always navigable. The ancient branches were, beginning at the west, the Canobic, Bolbitine, Sebennytic, Pathmitic, Mendesian, Tanitic, and Pelusiae, of which the modern Rosetta and Damietta branches represent the Bolbitine and Pathmitic.

The mean breadth of the river in Upper Egypt may be put at from half a mile to three-quarters, except where large islands increase the distance. In the Delta the branches are generally narrower.

A remarkable change has been ascertained to have occurred in the level of the Nile above Gebel-es-Silsileh, (near the ancient Silsilis. more than 80 miles south of Thebes), and throughout part of Nubia. Indications of this change were first observed by Professor Lepsius, who discovered hieroglyphic inscriptions on rocks at the Cataract of Semneh, not far above the Second Cataract, showing that the river attained a much higher level in the time of Dynasties XII. and XIII. before b.c. 2000. He gives the difference of the mean water-level at Semneh as 7 ’ 30 metres, or 23 , 94 feet English. He observes that the whole level of Upper Nubia was anciently greater, and similarly that of Lower Nubia between the First and Second Cataracts, but that in this second tract the present level was attained since the time of Thothmes III. of Dynasty XVIII. (Auszug aus einen Schreiben des Hrn. Lepsius an Hrn. Ehrenberg, Philae, 10thSept. 1844.) Sir Gardner Wilkinson pursued the inquiry in a paper in which he argued that the cause of the change of level which he traced in the Upper Thebais was the breaking of a rocky barrier at Gebel-es-Silsileh, where the low mountains on either side confine the river to a narrow channel (Trans. P. Soc, Lit., n.s., iv.).

The water of the Nile differs considerably in appearance and purity at various seasons of the year. A little after midsummer it becomes very turbid, and not long afterwards [9:7:706] it assumes a green colour for more than a fortnight, owing to the quantity of vegetable matter which it brings down from its upper course. It then resumes its turbid character for the period of the rise, and retains it, though in a less degree, for the remaining portion of the year, until the following midsummer. The water is extremely sweet, particularly in its turbid state. A careful filtration destroys its peculiar flavour, and the best method is to allow it to settle in the porous jars manufactured in the country. It is very wholesome, except during the short period at which it is green. The turbid appearance, greatest during the rise and inundation, is owing to the presence of large quantities of earthy matter, which are annually deposited. This deposit or mud of the Nile has been analyzed by M. Régnault. The specimen was dry, and taken from a canal which conducted the waters of the inundation. He obtained the following results :—
[table]

M. Regnault remarks that the quantities of silica and alumen vary according to the places whence the mud is taken, and that on the banks of the Nile it contains much sand, but when carried by the waters of the inundation to distant tracts it loses a quantity of sand in proportion to the distance, so that, when the distance is very considerable, the argillaceous matter is nearly pure; and thus the soil presents this matter in the different degrees of purity which the arts of pottery and brick-making require {Descr. de l’ Égypte, XX. 162-164).

The Nile shows the first signs of rising in Egypt about the time of the summer solstice. At Khartoom, where the White and Blue Niles join, the beginning of the increase is observed early in April (Clot-Bey, Aperçu, i. p. 3G, 37). The slowness of the rise in the earlier stage causes this difference. Usually the regular increase does not begin in Egypt until some days after the summer solstice, and the inundation begins about two months after that solstice. The river attains its greatest height at, or not long after, the autumnal equinox, and then, falling more slowly than it had risen, sinks to its lowest point at the end of nine months, when it remains stationary for a few days, until it begins again to increase. The inundation continues rather longer than it naturally would do, because the waters are retained for some time upon the lands by closing the mouths of the canals (see the table, Descr. de l'Égypte, xviii. i. 630, segg., for the details of the state of the Nile, from July 2, 1799, to April 10, 1800). The river’s banks being a little higher than the rest of the cultivable soil, the water is conveyed by canals or cuttings, and does not pour over the banks.

The inundations vary considerably, and, by either failing or rising to too great a height, cause much damage and distress. In the Description de l'Égypte (xviii. i. 626-629) there is a table of 66 inundations, of which 11 were very high, 30 good, 16 feeble, and 9 insufficient. This table was taken from the official records of the Nilometer on the island of Er-Rôdah, near Cairo, and comprehends the inundations of a.ii. 1150-1215 (a.d. 1737-1800).

The Nile rises about 40 feet at the First Cataract, about 36 at Thebes, about 25 at Cairo, and about 4 at the Rosetta and Damietta mouths during a good inundation {Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 89; Dcscr. de l' Égypte, xviii. i. 576, 577). When it is said, however, that the river has attained to a certain height in feet or cubits, the height at the Nilometer of Er-Rôdah above-mentioned is »leant; and by ancient writers, that of the river at Memphis, which was situate on the western bank, a little higher than Er-Rôdah. If the river do not attain a greater height than 18 or 20 feet, the rise is scanty; if only 2 or 4 feet more, insufficient; if it attain to 24 feet, or a greater height, not exceeding 27 feet, the inundation is good; buta higher rise must be characterized as a destructive flood {Descr. de l'Égypte, xviii. i. 616). Sometimes the inundation has failed altogether; as for seven years (a.ii. 457-464) in the reign of the Fatimee caliph El-Mustansir bi-llah, when there was a seven-years’ famine (see below, page 752); and low inundations always cause dearths. Excessive inundations, on the other baud, produce, or at least foster, the plague and murrain; so that a variation of a few feet is productive of the most serious consequences.

The current, when the Nile is low, has beeu estimated at about 2 miles in the hour, and at about 3 miles an hour when it is high. The volume of water which the Nile pours into the Mediterranean in 24 hours is as follows, according to M. Linant:—
[table]

Although the water is abundantly charged with alluvium throughout the year, and especially during the inundation, the annual deposit by the river, except under extraordinary circumstances, is very much smaller than might be supposed. Various computations have been made as to the exact deposit left in a century on the land, but they have not usually differed above an inch. If, however, we compare the quantity of deposit on certain very ancient structures, of which we know the date, we shall find that the amount has materially differed in various places. Such differences are the natural results of irregularities in the river’s course, of the strength or weakness of the current at particular places, of the nature of the country, and many other disturbing causes. The mean ordinary rate of the increase of the soil of Egypt has been calculated by Mr Lane as about 4⅜ inches in a century. M. Girard, in the Descr. de l'Égypte, makesit “very nearly” 126 millimètres, or 4 ’ 960 English inches. (For a remarkable instance of rapid deposit, see the Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 132-134, and plan, p. 126.)

The cultivable land of Egypt must be regarded as wholly the deposit of the Nile, but it is vain to attempt a calculation of the period at which this process began, since we cannot conclude that the same rate has always obtained, and we must suppose that the causes at first in operation were very different from those which now regulate the phenomenon.

At the time of the French occupation of Egypt it was found that the cultivable soil occupied only 6921 square miles, or somewhat more thau two-thirds of the whole space included between the deserts; but the quantity actually under cultivation did not exceed 5500 square miles, or six-elevenths of the entire surface. This proportion has since not materially changed. It was not always so, and the deficiency of the population is the principal cause that so large a proportion of the soil which might possibly be brought into a state of culture is left uncultivated.

Throughout Egypt the cultivable soil does not present any very great difference, being always the deposit of the river; it contains, however, more sand near the river than at a distance from it. Towards the Mediterranean, its [9:7:707] quality is injured by the salt with which the air is impregnated, and therefore it is not so favourable to vegetation. This condition, however, is not usually found far south of the sea, or the salt-marshes and lakes, which intervene for the most part between it and the land. In Lower Egypt we find the greater portion of the neglected tracts principally to the east and west of the modern Delta, and in its northern portion. In Upper Egypt the narrowness of the valley, and the more numerous population, preserve the country in a better state of cultivation, and the soil is somewhat richer. The largest uncultivated tracts lie on the western bank, where the valley is broadest, and in places where the great canal running parallel to the Nile has fallen into a state of neglect.

Condition of the Country.— Although some of the accounts of the classics may be deemed exaggerated when they speak of the population and prosperity of Egypt, we cannot accuse them of errors, except in the number of towns and of the inhabitants of the country; for the monuments show us how rich was Egypt under native rulers, and indicate to what causes this condition may reasonably be assigned. From the time at which the Great Pyramid was built to the Persian invasion, a period of between 2000 and 3000 years, the population of Egypt and its extent of cultivated land far exceeded what they are in the present day. The country does not seem to have been over-peopled; and many causes conduced to prevent this, particularly the serious wars in which the Pharaohs engaged. The long and desolating struggles with the Assyrians and Persians inflicted a severe blow on the interests of the country. Under the Macedonians it recovered much of its former prosperity; and when the Romans held Egypt, it was one of their most productive provinces, and a granary of the empire. During the Roman rule various political causes contributed to the decline of the population. After the Muslim conquest this decay continued almost uninterruptedly until the time of the Fatimees; but from that time until the Turkish conquest the rulers of the successive independent dynasties generally governed the country with a regard for its interests, and cannot be accused of the systematic tyranny and misrule of the Turkish pashas. There was a temporary recovery under the independent or semi-independent Memlook rulers before the French invasion; and in spite of much of the Turkish system the country lias again made good progress during the government of the family of Mehemet Ali. To overtaxation, forced labour, and needless wars,—in other words, government in a Turkish sense,—must be attributed the present misery of the peasant population, and the want of hands enough to cultivate the soil.

Physical causes have had far less to do with the impoverishment of Egypt than political ones. The elevation of the tract north of the Gulf of Suez, with the depression of the north coast of Egypt, has much diminished the cultivable soil in the Delta, by increasing the salt lakes and marshes which occupy its northern portion. There is, however, no greater fallacy than to suppose that the sands of the deserts have done injury by encroaching upon the alluvial tracts, and that once fertile regions are buried beneath them. In some places undoubtedly they have encroached upon the cultivable land, particularly where, as in the case of the canal of the Red Sea, the neglect of the Government had withdrawn the inundation, but no sooner was the Sweet Water Canal opened than fertility returned. On the other hand the deposit of the Nile has been constantly, in almost every part of the country, encroaching upon the deserts and diminishing their extent. It is neglect that has permitted the sand to drift over the soil where there have been no labourers to cultivate it. Above Gebel-es-Silsileh, in Upper Egypt, the change in the level of the river has placed cultivable soil almost wholly beyond the reach of the inundation, and thus made agriculture very laborious, but this is only for the space of about 40 miles in Egypt, where the extent of the cultivable soil must always have been small on account of the narrowness of the valley. The failure of five of the seven branches of the Nile is partly due to the neglect of the Government, as they might all have been retained as constantly running canals; and the decay of the great canal which runs parallel to the Nile throughout the chief part of Upper Egypt is traceable to the same cause.

Under the government of Mehemet Ali a great engineering work was begun with the view of bettering the condition of Egypt. This was the construction of a barrage across both branches of the Nile at the point of the Delta, in order to regulate the inundation, and thus render the country more fertile and easy of cultivation. After being abandoned this work is now to be completed. Its operation will on the whole be beneficial, although undoubtedly the power to be thus acquired by the khedive, of regulating the inundation for the benefit of his lands without reference to small proprietors, will be productive of much injustice. Egypt can never regain her ancient prosperity without a radical reform. The country has been governed under the Turks upon the system of getting the maximum of revenue from a peasantry allowed the minimum of sustenance. This is what is meant by the high-flown phrases one hears about the welfare of Egypt. The welfare of the population has never been contemplated. The frugal peasantry are kept at starvation-point, and no one prospers but the tax-gatherers of all grades, who constitute the richer class. Yet Egypt is better governed than the other provinces of the Turkish empire which enjoy a purely Turkish administration, for it is held net on the uncertain tenure of an ordinary pashalik, but as a copyhold which it is the interest of the tenant to keep in decent repair.

Agriculture.— Under the Pharaohs Egypt was an agricultural country, and both commerce and manufactures were comparatively unimportant. The main energies of the people were expended in turning to the best account a soil of unexcelled richness, annually watered and renewed by the river. This natural policy was the true one for the prosperity of the country. From the sculptures and paintings of the tombs, we form a clear idea of the agriculture of the ancient Egyptians, while the classical writers give us information respecting the tenure of land, and the laws affecting the cultivators.

In the representations of the tombs which picture the daily life of the great proprietors of land, we learn what especial attention they paid to the processes of agriculture. We see them constantly overseeing the labourers, and thus watching the interests of their lands. They were especially anxious to conduct the water of the Nile over those tracts which were not above its level at different periods of the year, and to raise it by manual labour to the higher portions of the land. In their canal-system they displayed mechanical skill, as well as in the construction of dams and dikes to retain the water upon the lands; but for raising water they seem to have been contented with the rudest contrivances. Indeed we know of but two methods that were employed in raising water,—the use of the simple machine called in the present day the shadoof, and buckets carried by men. The ordinary shâdoof still employed is of the same form as that used by the ancient Egyptians. It consists of a pole resting upon a beam placed across two columns of brick or mud. and having at one extremity a weight, and at the other a rude bowl-shaped bucket suspended by a stick. A man stands beneath it, and pulling down the bucket to the water raises it again, assisted by the weight. (For the ancieut form of the shadoof, see Anc. Eg., ii, 4; for the modern, Mod. Eg., chap, xiv.) [9:7:708] Immediately after the water of the inundation had subsided, the land was ploughed or broken up by the hoe, and sown, the seed being sometimes trodden in by goats driven over the field for the purpose. Wheat being the most important field-produce, we find the various agricultural processes connected with it frequently represented. Besides the ploughing and sowing, the harvest is depicted, the reapers cutting the wheat just below the ear, the ears being carried in nets or baskets by men or on asses to the thrashing-floor, wdιere they were thrashed by kiπe, Sometimes the wheat was bound in sheaves. The same or similar processes with reference to other kinds of grain are portrayed in the tombs, in which we also find curious representations of the vineyards and gardens. The vineyard was not the least valuable part of an estate. Egypt was famous for its wines in the days of the Greeks and Romans; and it is evident that wine must have been prized in earlier times from several kinds being enumerated in the inscriptions, and from its always being seen at the feasts. Besides the vine, other fruit-trees were cultivated, and especially the date-palm. The gardens were often extensive, and were laid out with great formality, partly in consequence of their being watered in the same manner as the fields generally, and contained tanks for fish as well as for purposes of inundation. The Egyptians paid great attention to preserving fish, and the produce of the fisheries of one great artificial lake, that of Moeris, formed an important branch of the revenue. There were also tracts left to reeds, which, if not planted, were at least carefully maintained, on account of their value for manufactures, and as covers for wild-fowl.

Diodorus Siculus states that anciently the land was the property of the priests, of the king, and of the military class (i. 73), and the monuments leave little room to doubt that such was generally the case; for though there were no castes, the upper classes consisted of priests and military officers, and the son usually followed his father’s profession. It is stated in the Bible that Joseph purchased the whole of the land of the Egyptians for food during the famine, and gave them seed to sow it, claiming a fifth of the produce as the king’s right. The land of the priests alone was not purchased.

The agriculture of the modern Egyptians differs little from that of the old inhabitants. In one respect it is the converse: the ancients excelled in the management of dikes and dams, and raised water only by the simplest methods; the moderns, while they have paid less attention to the great canals, and the means by which they were regulated, have employed more ingenious methods of artificial irrigation. The deficiency of population has partly caused the decay of many of the canals and dams and dikes, and has at the same time necessitated the economizing of human labour, for which that of cattle has been in a great measure substituted.

Of the machines the most common is the shâdoof, already described, but there are also two kinds of water-wheels. The more usual of these is that called the sâkiyeh, which is composed of a horizontal wheel turned by a pair of cows or bulls, or by one, and connected with a vertical wheel which is • ou the same axis as another around which are earthen pots in which the water is raised and poured into a trough. The tiiboot is a similar machine, which differs from the sâkiyeh principally in having a hollow wheel instead of the wheel with pots, in the jaunts or fellies of which the water is conveyed. Sometimes a katweh is employed, which is a bucket like that of the shadoof, having four cords by which two men dip it into the river or canal and raise the water. ( Mod. Eg., ch. xiv.) Steam-pumps are now largely used.

“The ’ rei ’ lands (or those which are naturally inundated) are, with some exceptions, cultivated but once during the year. After the waters have retired, about the end of October or beginning of November, they are sown with wheat, barley, lentils, beans, lupins, chick-peas, &c. This is called the ’ shitawee ’ (or winter) season. Hut the ‘ shar⅛kee , lands (or those which are too high to be subject to the natural inundation), and some parts of the rei, by artificial irrigation are made to produce three crops every year; though not all the sharakee lands are thus cultivated. The lands artificially irrigated produce, first, their shitawee crops, being sown at the same period as the rei lands, generally with wheat or barley. Secondly, in what is called the ‘ seyfee, ’ or in the southern part of Egypt the ‘keydee’ or ’ geydee ’ (that is, the summer) season, commencing about the venial equinox, or a little later, they are sown with millet (‘durah seyfee ’), or with indigo or cotton, &c. Thirdly, in the 1 demeereh’ season, or period of the rise of the Nile, commencing about or soon after the summer solstice, they are sown with millet again, or with maize (‘durah shamee ’), &c., and thus crowned with a third harvest. Sugar is cultivated throughout a large portion of Upper Egypt; and rice in the low lands near the Mediterranean.”— Mod. Eg., l.c.

The culture of cotton was introduced by Mehenιet Ali with a view to promote his manufacturing schemes, and the Turkish grandees have found it a source of temporary profit. During the American War the profit was at its height, but subsequently it declined. The necessity of constructing dams to exclude the Nile water from the cottongrowing fields has rendered the inundations destructive, and the speculation seems on the whole to have injured the welfare of Egypt.

The agricultural implements of the modern Egyptians are rude in construction, and similar to those auciently employed in the country. One of these, however, was not known to the earlier inhabitants. This is the nôrag, a machine “in the form of a chair, which moves upon small iron wheels or thin circular plates, generally eleven, fixed to three thick axle-trees, four to the foremost, the same number to the hindmost, and three to the intermediate axle tree. This machine is drawn in a circle by a pair of cows or bulls over the corn.” It is employed to separate the grain of wheat, barley, &c., and to cut the straw, which is used for fodder. (Mod. Eg., l.c.) The ancient Egyptians, as before remarked, generally cut the wheat near the ear.

An Egyptian garden is a miniature Egypt. It is intersected by numerous small channels which are filled by one or more water-wheels. By these channels the water is spread over the garden, divided by them into many square compartments, edged with ridges of earth. This system of course makes it very difficult to keep a garden in good order, and no great variety of flowers is cultivated.

Though Mehemet Ali was very desirous to encourage manufactures, he did not endeavour enough to apply modern science to the improvement of agriculture. Ibrahim Pasha, who succeeded him, always maintained that the country should be agricultural rather than manufacturing, and introduced important improvements during his father’s government. This system has been steadily pursued by the present ruler.

Before the time of Mehemet Ali a kind of feudal system prevailed, and much of the land was held by small proprietors under the protection of the great emeers. By the massacre of the Memlooks, the pasha destroyed feudalism, and by arbitrarily seizing almost all the landed property, rendered private tenure of land a most rare condition. He allotted to those whom he thus unjustly dispossessed annual pensions for life, as the only compensation for au act of tyranny to which even the history of Egypt scarcely affords a parallel {Mod. Eg., ch. iv.). Those whose lands were not confiscated yielded them up through fear, and buried their title-deeds, which are yet so concealed. A system of government in which the supreme authoιity overlooks such acts, and subordinate governors perpetrate them, in defiance of the Muslim code and Arab jurisprudence, demands the most thorough and searching reform.

Lakes.— Egypt has always been famous for its lakes, [9:7:709] which have either aided commerce, or supplied the inhabitants of the country with fish and wild fowl, or with valuable vegetable productions, or assisted in regulating the effects of the inundation. All have enriched the land in some one of these ways, and thus they have been important sources of its natural wealth.

Beginning our examination at the north-western extremity of Egypt, we first observe the lake now called Boheyret-Maryoot,^[17. “Boheyreh,” (pronounced “Boheyret” when followed by a genitive) signifiée “a little sea,” being the diminutive of “bahr,” “a sea, and is applied to large lakes, smaller ones · receiving the appellation “birkeh.” The distinction is not always maintained, for the great lake of the Feiyoom is called Birket-el-Karn.] and anciently Lake Mareotis. This is an extensive salt marsh rather than a lake, except during the inundation, when its contents are augmented by filtration. Anciently this lake was navigable, and thus contributed to the commercial importance of Alexandria. The country around was cultivated, and produced the famous Mareotic wine. The relations of various travellers show that it was still a lake during the 15th and 16th, and even towards the close of the 17th century; and Villamont in 1590 mentions that in his time the fisheries produced a considerable sum {Descr. de l’Égypte, xvi. 201). When, however, the French army conquered and occupied Egypt (1798-1801) they found its basin to be “a sandy plain, of which the lower portion retained the rain-water, which remained there for a great part of winter” (7√. 200, 201). On the 4th of April 1801 the English army, which was cooperating with that of the Grand Vizir against the French garrison of Alexandria, cut the dikes of the canal of that city, and admitted the waters of the Lake of Aboo-Keer into the ancient bed of Lake Mareotis, in order to cut off the water supply of the besieged (∕<Z. 201, 202). The basin of the lake being partially inhabited, some loss of life and property was the result of this act, which has reasonably been much called in question. The unhealthiness of Alexandria is also traceable to the formation of this marsh. The precedent thus set has been twice imitated, first by the Turks in 1803, and a second time by the English army under General Fraser in 1807. At the present day the lake or marsh is unprofitable, and its shores are uncultivated and uninhabited, the whole wearing the most dreary aspect.

To the north of Lake Mareotis is situate that of Aboo-Keer, Boheyret-Aboo-Keer. It is the northernmost portion of the other lake, from which it is separated by the Mahmoodeeyeh Canal (which here occupies the line of the older Canal of Alexandria), and the embankments or dikes which form its banks. It is very small, nowhere measuring 10 miles across, and extremely shallow, usually not exceeding 3 feet in depth. The water is salt, being chiefly derived from the sea, from which the lake is separated by a narrow strip of land on the western side, and on the eastern by a similar strip of far less breadth, the shore of the memorable Bay of Aboo-Keer.

To the east of the Lake of Aboo-Keer is that of Atkoo, Boheyret-Atkoo. It spreads when full nearly to the town of Rosetta, and is separated from the sea by a narrow neck of land on which stands the large village of Atkoo. Its extent varies according to the quantity of water which it receives from the inundation {Descr. de l'Égypte, xvi.

204) .

The great Lake of El-Burullus begins a little to the eastward of the Rosetta Branch, and stretches to somewhat beyond where the canal which was anciently the Sebennytic Branch enters it, and passing through it reaches the sea. Like the other northern lakes, it is separated from the Mediterranean by a narrow strip of land, the coast of Egypt. It is throughout very shallow (ZcZ.

205) . It is chiefly known for its water-melons, which are yellow within instead of being red or pink, and come into season after those grown on the banks of the Nile.

The easternmost of the lakes of Egypt is Boheyret-el-Menzeleh, which greatly exceeds the others in size. It extends from very near the Damietta Branch of the Nile to the mouth of the old Tanitic Branch, now called the canal of El-Mo’izz, which passes through the lake to the sea. It also receives the waters of the canals which were once the Mendesian and Pelusiae Branches. The northern shore is separated from the sea by an extremely narrow strip of land. At its south-eastern extremity is a long marshy creek extending into the desert. Its average length is about 40 miles, and its average breadth about 15. The depth is greater than that of the other lakes, and the water is salt, though mixed with fresh. Upon the surface are numerous islands, and the whole lake abounds in reeds of various kinds. It supports a considerable population of rude fishermen, who dwell in villages on the shore and islands, and live upon the fish of the lake. The reeds are cover for water-fowl of various kinds, which the traveller sees in great numbers, and wild boars are found in the marshes to the south. {Mod. Eg. and Thebes, i. 446.)

The Lake Serbonis, well known in former times as having swallowed up those passing over its marshes concealed by shifting sands, is now dry, and cannot be any longer included in the list of the lakes of Egypt.

Besides the lakes above mentioned are those called the Bitter Lakes, which should rather be termed marshes, occupying part of the ancient bed of the Red Sea between Suez and Lake Menzeleh, and also the Natron Lakes. The latter, which are very small, are situate in a valley of the western desert, not very far from the river: they will be noticed below.

In Upper Egypt there is but one lake of importance. It is the Birket-el-Karn, or Lake of El-Karn, at the extremity of the Feiyoom, which is, as already mentioned, an oasis on the western side of the river, to which an opening in the mountains leads. The lake is about 35 miles long, and its widest part a little exceeds 7 miles, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, while in several places it is considerably narrower. About the middle is a single island. The depth is not great, for the same author, who “sounded in several places,” “found what is considered the deepest part to be only 28⅜ feet” {Mod. Egypt and Thebes, ii. 344-5). Its level is far below that of the Nile, as the bank of the river at Benee-Suweyf, at the entrance of the valley leading to the Feiyoom, is upwards of a hundred feet highor than the water of the lake {Ibid. 346). The shores are barren or uncultivated; the northern is desert and bounded by sandy mountains; the southern was in ancient times partly cultivated. The water is brackish and unwholesome, though the fishermen, of whom there are a few, drink it.

The famous Lake Moeris lay between the Feiyoom and the Nile, not far from the river. It was an artificial work executed by Amenemhat III., of Dynasty XII. The irrigation of neighbouring tracts was regulated by it, and its fisheries formed an important part of the revenue. After the subjugation of Egypt by the Romans its dikes were neglected, and by degrees it became ruined. Its position and extent were considered doubtful, until M. Linant’s excellent memoir, published by the Egyptian Society of Cairo, established these points most satisfactorily from the remains of its basin, which are yet traceable {Mémoire sur le Lac Moeris, Soc. Eg., 1843).

Canals.— The canals of Egypt deserve especial attention from their great importance in extending the beneficial influence of the inundation. In Lower Egypt we find, beginning from the west, first the Mahmoodeeyeh Canal, which connects Alexandria with the Rosetta Branch, taking [9:7:710] a similar direction to that of the ancient canal which it has succeeded. It was dug under Mehemet Ali; and although not quite 50 miles in length, and not 100 feet broad, about 12,000 labourers are said to have died in ten mouths while the work was in progress (Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 47, 48). This is well known to be a tolerably accurate statement of the losses experienced by the unfortunate workmen, and is only one of the many instances which the history of our own times affords of that reckless disregard of human life, which is one of the worst traits of Turkish character.^[18. A note from the eighth edition of this work is here reprinted in substance Writers on the East have not generally been careful to distinguish the Turkish and Arab national character, and the former has thus had the advantage of the virtues of the latter, which has received in return the odium of the other’s vices. The remarkable characteristics of Arab character are high honour, generous hospitality, and humanity, coupled with much deceit in small matters not considered points of honour, carelessness as to religion, though not irréligion, and a love of plunder. The Turkish character is as strongly marked by treachery, often of the blackest kind, little hospitality, particularly to strangers, cruelty and disregard of human life, bigotry as to their religion, which is now giving way to deism, and the same love of plunder which is so common among the Arabs, as well as darker vices unknown to them, which have rendered the Turkish name a bye-word in the East, as well as in the West. The conquests of the Arabs were not marked by desolation; their rule preserved the philosophy of Greece, which was welcome at the court of Baghdad when unknown in Europe. Arab art was due to them, and though long maintained under Turkish rule, at last perished through it. The rule of tile Turks is traced by ruined cities, and whole provinces laid waste; literature has forsaken its most famous seats, Constantinople, Athens, Alexandria, and Antioch; the arts have decayed. Until they held ⅛JT ’ t ar, *l Mesopotamia, these were the richest countries of the world, now they are half deserts. All these are facts which can be proved.]

Between the Rosetta and Damietta Branches are several canals, some of which are of importance, particularly the short canal of Manoof connecting the two branches not far from the point of the Delta. To the east of the Damietta Branch are others, of which the most remarkable occupy the beds of the Tanitic and Pelusiae Branches, which have been cleared to a sufficient extent to form canals. The former of these, which lies to the westward of the other, is called the Canal of El-Mo’izz, the first Fâtimee caliph who ruled in Egypt, having been dug by his orders, and the latter bears the name of the Canal of Abu-l-Munegga, a Jew who executed this work, under the caliph El-’Amir, in order to water the province called the Sharkeeyeh. The last mentioned canal is connected with the remains of that which anciently joined the Nile and the Red Sea. Of this important work the greater part was destroyed through neglect, but it has been restored, as the Sweet Water Canal, in order to supply the establishments on the Suez Canal with fresh water. It was of the Pharaonic times, having been begun by Ramses IL, or Sesostris, continued by Neku II. and by Darius Hystaspis, and at length finished by Ptolemy Philadelphus.

The extent and character of the great canal called the Bahr-Yoosuf, or River of Joseph, which runs parallel with the Nile on its western side, from a little below Cairo to near Farshoot, a distance by the river of about 350 miles, render it the most important work of the kind in Egypt. It is a continuous series of canals rather than one canal. Although the Joseph whence it takes its name is the celebrated Saladin, or Salâh-ed-deen, yet it is related that he merely repaired it, and it is not doubted to be of a much earlier period. Most probably it was executed under the Pharaohs. In the present day it is not navigable except during the season of the inundation, and at other times is dry in various places. Its restoration would not be a work of extreme difficulty, and would greatly benefit the commerce and agriculture of the country, perhaps more than any other undertaking of the kind.

Vegetable Products.— Egypt differs from most other countries in having neither woods nor forests. Besides the palm groves, we rarely see even a grove of trees, except in Lower Egypt. The largest common trees are acacias, sycamore-fig-trees, and mulberry-trees, all of which are frequently planted on each side of the great roads near Cairo; and the most beautiful trees are the date-palm and the banana. The beauty of the palm is, however, in a great measure owing to art, for its lowest branches are annually cut, which causes it to grow high, and renders its head of elegant form. When wild, this tree has a far inferior appearance, being low, and having long ragged branches reaching to the ground; and its dates are small and poor in flavour. The Theban or dδm-palm is a very different tree, having two great branches, each of which divides into two other branches, a subdivision which continues still farther. The weeping-willow, myrtle, elm, and cypress are found in the gardens and plantations, with various trees bearing the fruits to be next mentioned; and the tamarisk is to be seen everywhere.

The most common of the fruits are dates of various kinds, which are sold half-ripe, ripe, dried, and pressed in their fresh moist state in mats or skins. Many different sorts are enumerated as known in Egypt. The dependencies, however, and not Egypt, produce the finest of these dates. The hotter and drier climates of the Oases and Lower Nubia best suit the date-palm; and the pressed dates of Seewah, the ancient Oasis of Jupiter Ammon, are among the most esteemed. The grape is a common fruit, but wine is not made from it on account of the prohibition of Mohammad. The Feiyoom is celebrated for its grapes, and chiefly supplies the market of Cairo. The most common grape is white, of which there is a small kind far superior to the ordinary sort. The black grapes are large, but comparatively tasteless. The vines arc trailed on trelliswork, and form agreeable avenues in the gardens of Cairo; but little attention is paid to their culture, the common fault of Egyptian agriculture and gardening, due to the generosity of nature and the indolence of the inhabitants.

The best known fruits, besides dates and grapes, are figs, sycamore-figs, and pomegranates, apricots and peaches, oranges and citrons, lemons and limes, bananas, which are believed to be of the fruits of Paradise (being always in season), different kinds of melons (including some of aromatic flavour, and the refreshing water-melon), mulberries, Indian figs or pr ckly pears, the fruit of the lotus, and olives. Many of these are excellent, especially the figs and melons. The trees and plants which produce most of them are chiefly confined to the gardens. The cactus bearing the Indian fig is extremely common, and forms the hedges of gardens and plantations.

The general plan of an Egyptian garden has been already described. Although seldom in good order, such a garden is often picturesque, having a few date-palms and bananas, and perhaps overlooked by one of those houses of the old style of architecture which are rapidly disappearing. No great variety of flowers is cultivated. Among the more usual are the rose (which has ever been a favourite among the Arabs), the jasmine, narcissus, lily, oleander, chrysanthemum, convolvulus, geranium, dahlia, basil, the hinnè plant (Lawsonia alba, or Egyptian privet, which is said to be a flower of Paradise), the helianthus, and the violet.

The vegetables, <fcc., are very common and of various kinds, so that we cannot wonder that the Children of Israel longed for them in the desert. The principal are beans, pease, vetches, lentils (of which a pottage is made, which is the common food of the Nile boatmen), lupins, chick-pease, the loobiyeh (Dolichos lubia), fenugreek, mallows, the bamiyeh {Hibiscus esculentus), spinach, purslain, [9:7:711] melookheeyeh (Corchorus olitorius), leeks, onions, garlic, celery, parsley, chicory, cress, radishes, carrots, turnips, colocasia, lettuce, cabbage, fennel, gourds and cucumbers (both of several kinds), the tomato, the egg-fruit or badingàn (black and white), caraway, coriander, cumin, aniseed, and red pepper.

The chief field-produce is wheat (which is more grown than any other kind of corn), barley, several sorts of millet, maize, rice, oats, clover, pease, the sugar-cane, roses, two species of the tobacco-plant, and cotton, now largely cultivated. The sugar-cane is extensively cultivated, and excellent sugar is manufactured from it. There are fields of roses in the Feiyoom, which supply the market with rose-water. The tobacco produced in Egypt is coarse and strong compared with that which is used by the middle and upper classes and imported from Syria and Turkey. That of Syria is considered the best. Of textile plants, the principal are hemp, cotton, and flax; and of plants used for dyeing, bastard saffron, madder, woad, and the indigo plant. The intoxicating hasheesh, which some smoke in a kind of water-pipe formed of a cocoa-nut, two tubes, and a bowl, seldom used for any other narcotic, is not, as has been erroneously supposed, opium, but hemp. The effect is most baneful. The leaves of the hinnè plant are used to impart a bright red colour to the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, and the nails of both hands and feet, of women and children, the hair of old ladies, and the tails of horses. Indigo is very extensively employed to dye the shirts of the natives of the poorer classes, and is, when very dark, the colour of mourning; therefore, women at funerals, and generally after a death, smear themselves with it. Oil is extracted from the seeds of the cotton plant·, hemp, colewort, the poppy, the castor-oil plant, sesame, and flax. The high coarse grass called halfeh (7 ’ oα cynosurdides) grows in great quantity in waste place3 and among ancient ruins.

Many kinds of reeds are found in Egypt, though, if we compare the representations in the ancient tombs with what we see in the present day, it is evident that they were formerly much more common. That they should be wasted away was prophesied by Isaiah (xix. 6, 7). The famous byblus, or papyrus, from which paper was manufactured, appears to be nearly, if not quite extinct, since Sir Gardner Wilkinson had never seen it (Mod. Eg. and Thebes, i. 441). M. Delile, in his excellent account of the Egyptian flora, merely mentions it by name in his list as the Cyperιιs Papyrus, called in Arabic berdy, and found at Damietta,^[19. Cyperus Papyrus, Linn.—Arab, berdy, Damiatae.” Description de l’Egypte, tom. xix. 71. Other Cyperi are described at pp. 125-6 and 130-2 of the same volume.] but gives no figure of it. The lotus, greatly prized for its flowers by the ancient inhabitants, is still found in Egypt, though it is not common. The French naturalist above mentioned enumerates three species which formerly grew in that country, one with white flowers, another with blue, and a third with rose-coloured, the last of which is now extinct there. On the botany of Egypt, see Boissier, Flora Orientalis, in progress.

Animals.— The zoology of Egypt is not of remarkable interest, although it contains some very curious points. The absence of jungle and Df forest, and the little cover thus afforded to beasts of prey, as well as other wild animals, partly causes this; and we observe few birds of beautiful plumage for the same reason.

One of the most characteristic of the beasts is the camel, which is more at home in the dry climate of Egypt than elsewhere out of his native deserts. It has been remarked, however, that the camel, like his master the Arab.

degenerates when removed into a city or a cultivated tract, that the former commonly becomes mangy, and the latter experiences a physical and moral degradation. The Egyptian camel is of the one-humped kind, which has been erroneously called the dromedary, whereas the dromedary is merely a swift camel standing in the same relation to the ordinary camel that our saddle-horse does to our cart-horse. Camel’s flesh is for the most part eaten only by the peasants and the Arabs of the desert; by the Copts it is considered unlawful food.

It is very remarkable that no representation of the camel has been found in the sculptures and paintings of the Egyptian monuments, among the very numerous figures of the animals of Egypt both tame and wild, and of those brought from foreign lands as presents. It does not appear to have been introduced into other African countries until after the Christian Era (comp. Desmoulins, Mem. lu à l , Institut, 28 Juin 1823); but it was known to the Egyptians, although it is by no means certain that it was one of their domestic beasts. Two passages in the Bible which speak of camels in the possession of Pharaohs (Gen. xii. 16; Ex. ix. 3) refer to the time at which foreign tribes had been settled in Egypt; and perhaps the camel was peculiarly the animal of one or all of those tribes, and, as they were hated by the Egyptians, it may have been omitted in the representations of the monuments.

To modern Egypt the camel is very valuable, since the traffic with Syria, Arabia, Western Africa, and Ethiopia is to a great extent carried on by caravans. But the ancient Egyptians appear to have derived their wealth more from tributary presents than from commerce, to have allowed their land commerce to be much in the hands of foreign merchants, like those who brought Joseph into Egypt, and to have left even their sea commerce partly at least to foreigners.

The horse is not known to have been used in Egypt before the time of the Empire. Thenceforward the horses of Egypt were famous, and the armies of the Pharaohs were noted for their war-chariots. From Egypt, Solomon, and in his time the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria, had horses and chariots (J K. x. 28, 29). And long after, when first the kingdom of Israel and then that of Judah endeavoured to throw off the yoke of the great kings of the East, and made alliance with Egypt, they put their trust in Pharaoh’s horses (Isa. xxxi. 1). Tn the representations of battles fought by the kings of the Empire we see no Egyptian cavalry, but only chariots, called “horse” in the inscriptions. At later times they may have had cavalry, properly speaking, of their own, and perhaps at all times among the mercenary or auxiliary forces.

In the present day the horses of Egypt are of a very indifferent breed, and the best that one sees in that country have been brought from Arabia and Syria, but these are seldom of great excellence. It is indeed surprising to find few really good horses in a country bordering on Arabia; and not many years ago this was still more remarkable, though not during the existence of the Memlooks. The finest Arabs, however, are kept in the background by their possessors, partly for fear of the “evil eye,” and partly, in the case of all but the highest dignitaries, to avoid their forcible seizure by those of greater rank and power.

The Egyptian ass holds a middle place between that of Great Britain and the wild ass, which is more swift of foot than the horse. It is tall and handsome, docile, and having excellent paces, particularly a quick and easy amble. Thus it is well suited to the narrow streets of the t0wn3 of Egypt, and is therefore commonly used for riding by persons of the middle and lower classes. The mules are [9:7:712] handsome, but noted for vice, and for not being surefooted.

The cattle are short-horned, rather small, and, as of old, very beautiful, speaking artistically. They are exceedingly quiet in disposition, and much valued for agricultural labour by the people, who therefore very rarely slaughter them for meat, and then only for the Franks. Buffaloes of an uncouth appearance and of a dark slaty colour, strikingly contrasting with the neat cattle, abound in Egypt. When voyaging on the Nile, one often sees them standing or lying in the river by herds. They are very docile, and the little children of the villagers often ride them to or from the river. They are sometimes slaughtered, but their flesh is tough and coarse. Sheep (of which the greateι number are black) and goats are abundant in Egypt, and mutton is the ordinary butcher’s meat. Swine are very rarely kept, and then almost wholly for the Franks, the Copts generally abstaining from eating their meat. It appears that the ancient Egyptians, though not forbidden this flesh, rarely ate it, perhaps because it is extremely unwholesome in a hot climate.

The Muslims consider dogs unclean, and therefore those of Cairo and most of the towns are half-wild and without masters, living upon offal, and upon food thrown to them by humane persons. In the villages, however, and particularly in the Thebais, their case is better, for they are kept as guards to protect live stock from thieves, and from hyenas and other wild animals, which come from the deserts by night in quest of prey. The common dog of Egypt is generally of a sandy colour and strong, though not remarkable for courage; but in Upper Egypt, about Thebes, there is a fierce breed of dogs with wiry hair, generally black, and much esteemed for courage by their masters. Cats are as numerous in Cairo as dogs, and many of them are as homeless. They are, however, liked by the natives, who assign as their reason that Mohammad was fond of cats. This may perhaps be regarded as a relic of the veneratiou in which they were held by the ancient Egyptians. It is not a little curious, that there is at Cairo a royal foundation for the support of destitute cats. The author of this charity was the famous Memlook sultan, Edh-Dhâhir Beybars, whose humane intentions have of late years been sadly neglected by the trustees.

The wolf, fox, jackal, and hyena chiefly inhabit the deserts and waste places of Egypt, and lurk iu the ancient tombs and deserted quarries. The wild cat is also found in that country, though it is not common. The weasel abounds in Cairo, and is proverbial for its mischievous and revengeful disposition, and rats and mice are not among the least of the plagues. The ichneumon, jerboa, hare i and hyrax are likewise natives of Egypt or its deserts, and the tame rabbit is kept for food.

The beasts of the chase of the Egyptian deserts are antelopes of various kinds, and the wild ass, esteemed by the Arabs and Persians to be the prince of game, which is found in the southern part of the Eastern Desert. The most beautiful of the antelopes is the gazelle, which is often tamed and kept in the large courts of the houses of Cairo. In Lower Egypt, principally in the desolate marshes near the Mediterranean, the wild boar is found and occasionally hunted. It is, however, a timid animal, so that the sport is not, like boar-hunting elsewhere, exciting and dangerous.

From the representations in the tombs we see that in old times the hippopotamus was one of the wild beasts of the country. It has now retreated above the First Cataract, the southern boundary of Egypt. The crocodile has retreated in the same manner, and instead of being found throughout the Nile in Egypt, is rarely seen even in Lower Nubia. The name of the island of Elephantine, situaie a little to the north of the First Cataract, bearing the same signification in hieroglyphics as in Greek, makes it probable that at some remote period elephants were found in Upper Egypt, though now they are not seen north of Abyssinia.

In exploring the tombs and dark parts of the temples the traveller is annoyed by crowds of bats, which extinguish his candle, fly into his face, and cling to his clothes, sometimes rendering examination impossible without a lantern. One species is very large, but the common one is small.

Birds of prey are numerous in Egypt, and of many kinds. Of the most remarkable are three species of large nakednecked vultures—the Arabian, the sociable, and the fulvous; as well as the smaller species called the aquiline vulture. The aquiline vulture has a feathered neck, and when standing is by no means a handsome bird, but it is much to be admired when on the wing from the contrast of the black and white of its plumage, and the steady manner in which it soars in circles. Perhaps the bearded vulture breeds in the most lofty parts of the desolate mountains of the Eastern Desert; for when the French army was in Egypt, one of these birds was killed. It is said to have been of extraordinary size, measuring more than 14 Parisian feet, or more than 15 English, from point to point of its expanded wings. Several species of eagles and falcons, two kinds of hawks, the common buzzard, and the moorharrier live in Egypt, or visit that country, according as they are migratory, erratic, or sedentary. The common kite abounds at Cairo, and is one of the chief scavengers of the city, the others being the crow, the aquiline vulture, the half-wild dog, and the cat. The ruins aud tombs of Egypt, and the modern houses, scarcely ever in perfect repair, shelter owls of various kind3.

The Spanish sparrow, which differs little from that of Britain, the water-wagtail, linnets, and larks are among the birds of Egypt. The kind of kingfisher which is commonly seen on the Nile, perched on some eminence, and darting suddenly to seize a fish, is very inferior in its plumage, which is speckled, black and white, to the common kingfisher, which is also occasionally seen. The beautiful hoopoe is among the least rare birds, and there are also three species of bee-eaters. The hoopoe may be often seen in Cairo, where it is regarded with some reverence, as the bird of Solomon. Crows of the kind which we call the Royston crow are very numerous at Cairo. Birds of the swallow tribe, the wood pecker, and the cuckoo are also known in Egypt.

In the metropolis, in the towns and villages, and in the fields, no bird is more common than the pigeon, tame or wild. Pigeon-fancying is a favourite amusement of all classes at Cairo, aud in the villages the pigeon-houses are often loftier than the huts upon which they are raised. Tourists on the Nile inflict great loss on the poor peasantry by recklessly shooting these tame birds. Wild turtle-dovee build in the courts of the houses of the capital. These courts often serve for the purpose of poultry-yards, in which fowls wander about without any care being taken of them, except that food is occasionally thrown to them. They are consequently meagre, and produce very small eggs. Turkeys, ducks, and geese are kept in the same manner.

Quails migrate to Egypt in great numbers; aud sandgrouse, called by the natives kata, from their cry, are common in the deserts. There also the Arabs, like the ancient Egyptians, hunt the ostrich. A red-legged partridge is likewise found in Egypt.

The islands of the Nile, the sand-banks which appear when the river is low, the lakes and marshes, the sheets [9:7:713] of water caused by the inundation, and the mountains neaι the river, are the favourite resorts of many kinds of wading and of web-footed birds.

Of the waders the most interesting would be the sacred ibis of Egypt, if that bird be now found there. But it does not appear certain that only one species was anciently held sacred, and if so that this is the ∕6ιs religiosa of Cuvier now known in Egypt. The Egyptian plover is famous on account of the story, which modern observation has confirmed, related by Herodotus respecting it and the crocodile. Among the most common waders are the spur-winged plover, the snow-white egret, which has been erroneously called the ibis, and the pelican. The cormorant, too, is often seen, as are wild geese and ducks, both of several kinds.

Of the many reptiles the crocodile occupies the first place. It is seldom observed in the present day in Upper Egypt. Some years ago it was usual south of Asyoυt to see several crocodiles basking in the sun in the heat of the day on a sand-bank; at the approach of a boat they would quickly plunge into the stream. They rarely attack a human being, but it is unwise to bathe in the river at places where they are reputed to be fierce, and to bathe at any distance from a boat in the part of Upper Egypt where they are found. It is said that the Crocodile’s common mode of attacking a person on shore, who is near the river’s edge, is to approach stealthily and sweep him into the stream by a blow of his tail, the great weapon of all the lizard-tribe. The smaller saurians are found in great numbers: of these a species of chameleon may be mentioned.

Serpents and snakes are among the most common reptiles, aud are of various kinds, including the deadly cerastes and cobra di capello. The house snakes, however, which are numerous at Cairo, are harmless.

Fisheβ abound in the Nile and in the Lake Menzeleh. The modern inhabitants of the couutry are partial to fish as food, but they say that only those fishes which have scales are wholesome. The fishes of the Nile are generally insipid in comparison to those of the sea; though a few of them, particularly the bultee (Labrus niloticus, Linn.), the kishr (Perea nilotica), and the binnee (Cyprinus bynni, Arted.), are of a delicate flavour.

One of the commonest insects is the dangerous scorpion. Its sting is very painful, and, if no remedy is applied, sometimes fatal, particularly if a person is stung in the heel.^[20. A little ipecacuanha, made into a paste with water and applied externally to the place stung, has produced, in the many instances in which the writer has known it used, almost instant relief.] Large spiders are abundant, including more than one species of solpuga, incorrectly called tarantulas by the Europeans, and believed by the natives to be very venomous, but this is most likely an error Egypt has ever been famous for what may be termed insect-plagues, but not to the extent that has been asserted by some modern travellers. Caution will enable one partially to escape the attacks of fleas and bugs, and altogether to avoid the more dreaded insect usually spoken of with them. Beetles of various kinds are found, including that which was anciently held sacred, the scarabaeus. Locusts are seldom seen, and very rarely in large numbers. When, however, such is the case, they commit great havoc in the fields and gardens, reminding one of the account of the plague of locusts which preceded the Exodus, and the remarkable passage in the book of Joel (ii. 1-11) describing an invading army as a destructive flight of locusts. Sometimes they merely cross the valley of Upper Egypt, and leave the mark of their passage in desolated fields, entirely stripped of verdure; and at other times they spread themselves for days, or even weeks, over the cultivated lands, committing far more extensive mischief.

Bees are kept in Egypt, and their honey is much prized by the inhabitants, who usually eat it in a clarified state. It is inferior to that of England, and also to the famou.- Greek honey. Butterflies and moths of many kinds are observed in the fields. There are plantations of mulberry· trees in the eastern part of Lower Egypt, for the rearing of silk-worms. The manufacture of silks was a Government monopoly, but has lately ceased to be so. The silks of Egypt are generally inferior to those of Syria and other Eastern countries, though some have been produced of great excellence. Among the other insects may be mentioned the common fly, rightly deserving a place among the plagues of Egypt, as doeε also the mosquito, which, however, is not found throughout the country.

Ancient Inhabitants.— In the following remarks on the ancient Egyptians great assistance has been derived from the valuable work of Sir Gardner Wilkinson on their Manners and Customs, which has made us better acquainted with them than we are with any other people of antiquity. From the representations of their monuments, and from the mummies which have been unrolled, we can form an accurate idea of the personal characteristics of the ancient Egyptians. In consequence of a misconception of a passage in Herodotus (ii. 104), and confused notions respecting the inhabitants of Africa, it has been often supposed that the Egyptians were very nearly allied to the negro race. A careful examination of the most distinct data in our possession has, however, produced a far different result; and it is now acknowledged that they were more related to the Caucasian than to the negro type. It has also been shown that most of the modern inhabitants have preserved many of the characteristics of their ancient predecessors, and that it is, therefore, erroneous to suppose that they are chiefly of Arab origin, although the intermixture of Arab blood has so much changed the national type that it would not be safe to describe the earlier people from the appearance of the present. Nevertheless, one is often struck, among the remains of ancient monuments, by the similarity of an early representation to some one of the natives standing by, priding himself upon an Arab origin, and repudiating the reproach that he is of the race of Pharaoh.

Judging from the monuments and mummies, the countenance of the ancient Egyptians was oval, and narrower in the case of the men than of the women. The forehead was small and somewhat retiring, but well-shaped; the eyes large, long, and generally black; the nose rather •long, and with a slight bridge; the mouth expressive, with rather full lips, and white and regular teeth; the chin small and round, and the cheek-bones a little prominent. The hair was long, full, crisp, somewhat harsh, and almost always black. The beard was worn in so artificial a mode that one cannot judge whether it was full or not. The skin of the men was dark brown; that of the women varied from olive to pink flesh-colour in different persons. The colour of the women was natural, and the darker hue of the men the result of exposure to the sun, and the scantiness of their clothing explains why their faces were not darker thau the rest of their bodies.

The dress of the ancient Egyptians did not much vary at different periods. Under Dynasty IV. it was, however, simpler thau under the Empire. As most monuments remain of the Empire, the dress of the inhabitants at that time will be described, and this description will apply, in its main particulars, to the earlier and later times of their aucient history.

The men of all classes either had shaven heads, with skull-caps, or wore their own hair, or wigs, very full, and in numerous plaits or curls, falling to the shoulders, but sometimes much shorter and in the form of a bag; there [9:7:714] is, indeed, reason to suppose that the practice of shaving the -head was universal, except among the soldiers. All the hair of the face was also shaven, except in the cases of kings and great persons, who bad a small formal beard, possibly artificial, beneath the chin.

The king was distinguished from his subjects by the richness of his apparel. His head-dress was sometimes his own hair, or the wig, alone; and at others he wore the high crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt, the former being a kind of conical helmet, and the latter a short cap with a tall point behind, worn outside the other. He is also occasionally represented with another form of high cap. The figure of an asp, the emblem of royalty, is often tied just above his forehead. His beard was about three inches long, and one inch broad and deep, and formally plaited.

The simplest royal dress was a kilt, usually reaching nearly to the knees, rather full in front, having a girdle above, from which hung before a broad band, richly ornamented, and peculiar to the king, like the lion’s tail (natural or artificial) which was attached to it behind, and reached nearly to the ground. Sometimes a large and full shirt was worn over the kilt, descending almost to the ankles, and having wide sleeves reaching to the elbow: this outer dress is occasionally simply a skirt. Both these dresses were usually of white linen, and the outer dress was apparently very fine and transparent. Sandals were worn on the feet, and the ornaments were armlets, bracelets, both flat and broad, and deep necklaces.

The ordinary costume of men of the upper and middle classes was the same as that of the king, the short kilt, with sometimes the long shirt or skirt of fine linen above it, tied in various forms. Their beards were very short, scarcely exceeding an inch in length, and of a formal square shape, and they wore the full hair or wig, or a skull-cap. They generally went barefoot, but sometimes used sandals. The priest was occasionally clad in a leopard’s skin, either tied or thrown over the shoulder, or worn as a shirt, the fore-leg3 forming sleeves. Military personages are often represented with helmets, and sometimes with short coats or corslets of plate-mail. The royal princes were distinguished by a side lock apparently curiously plaited.

The men of the lower class wore the kilt and girdle alone, or, especially when engaged in laborious work, went altogether naked. They shaved the head and face, and had no head-covering but the skull-cap. The soldiers had kilts of different kinds, and coats or corslets of plate-mail, and either wore full hair or helmets.

The dress of the queen consisted of a tight skirt, descending to the ankles, supported by shoulder-straps, and bound at the waist by a girdle, with long ends falling in front. Over this was usually worn a full shirt of fine linen, with wide sleeves reaching below the elbows, and having a broad skirt falling to the ground. It much resembles the upper dress of the king, or of men of the richer classes. The queen was distinguished by her head-dress, which was in the form of a vulture with outspread wings, the bird’s head projecting over the forehead, and the wings falling on either side, while the tail extended behind. Sometimes the queen is also known by the royal asp above her forehead, and at other times she is represented with various forms of head-dress. The queen also wore sandals. (For illustrations of royal dress see Costume, vol. vi., p. 457-8.)

The dress of ladies was the same as that of the queen, without the distinguishing ornaments, but they frequently appeared in the under garment or skirt alone. The women of the lower class wore that garment only, and sometimes it was much shorter than that of the ladies, particularly when they were engaged in manual labour. The women’s hair was worn in the same manner as the men’s, but it was of greater length, usually reaching about halfway from the shoulders to the waist, being rarely longer, and sometimes much shorter. It was ornamented in various ways, but the general form was always the same.

The children of all ranks were very simply dressed, when clad at all, though those of rich persons were sometimes attired as their elders. Boys were distinguished by the side-lock, which the princes, as before mentioned, wore in a peculiar fashion.

Religion.— The credit which the Egyptian priests enjoyed in antiquity for a knowledge of philosophy led to the expectation among modern scholars that, when hieroglyphics were read, the world would recover a lost body of human speculation. The first results disappointed this expectation, but later studies have gone far to justify it. The statement of what those studies have achieved may be divided into the two main subjects—the teaching as to the gods and that as to man’s duties and destinies, rites and ceremonies coming under both heads.

Had the Egyptians any idea of one God ?—in other words, is their religion a complex structure raised upon a recognized monotheistic foundation 1 The Egyptian religious writings are held by M. de Ilougé to give an affirmative answer to this question. They speak of one supreme being, self-existent, self-producing, the creator of heaven and earth, called the double god or double being, as the parent of a second manifestation. From the idea of a supreme deity, at once father and mother, producing a second form, probably originated a first triad like the triads of father, mother, and son frequent in Egyptian mythology. To the local divinities the attributes of th s supreme deity are given, as though they were mere personifications: that they were originally so is, however, not certain. Ra, the sun, is indeed spoken of as this supreme being, but this appears to have been a later phase of opinion. (De Rougé, “Etudes sur le Rituel Funéraire,” 7ι⅛u Arch., n.s., i. 356 seqq.} It was probably an attempt to substitute a popular materialistic belief for a philosophical creed. A significant instance of this tendency is perhaps seen in the endeavour of a king of Dynasty XVIII. to abolish all worship but that of the solar disk—sun-worship in its most material form.

A very ancient moral tract, the papyrus of Ptah hotep, composed under Dynasty V., although a purely Egyptian work, mentioning Osiris and a divinity who may be a form of Osiris, yet speaks constantly of God as if the author had the idea of one God.^[21. “L’idée abstraite de la Divinité intervient fréquemment dans 1⅛ texte, comme si l'auteur avait la notion de l’unité et de l'indivisibilité divine. Mais cette manière de parler n’appartient pas exclusivement à cet antique document. On la rencontre fréquemment dans les textes plus modernes et notamment an Rituel. D’ailleurs le nom d’Osiris et celui de Dieu double crocodile suffisent pour nous démontrer que nous avons affaire λ un monument de pure origine égyptienne.” Chabas, “Le plus ancien livre du monde,” Rev. Arch. xv. IG.]

It also appears from one remarkable fact that this idea prevailed in Egypt before the conversion of the nation to Christianity. The Copts took care to eliminate from their vocabulary all the words connected with the religion of their forefathers, substituting for them Greek equivalents. Their term for God is, however, not Greek but Egyptian, ΠOY v f"> ^ ιe hieroglyphic neter. They also used it for heathen objects of worship, god or goddess. These uses must therefore have been prevalent in the vulgar dialect when it was first written in Coptic.

Though it cannot reasonably be doubted that the Egyptians had a distinct idea of monotheism, this idea was mixed up with the basest polytheism. The double character which we perceive in the race and the language, both partly Nigritian, partly Semitic, is equally evident in the religion. Every town in Egypt had its sacred [9:7:715] animal, or fetish, and every town its local divinities. Λs the animal worship was associated with higher ideas by the union of an animal’s head with the body of a man in the figures of divinities, so the local divinities were connected with the monotheistic idea by intermediate forms, principally identifying them with Ra, who thus was the generally received form of the notion of one god. According to this view monotheism was not the parent of polytheism, but in a later phase connected with it.

One great change affected the essential ideas of the Egyptian religion. For many centuries Seth, specially the divinity of Lower Egypt, who seems to have represented then, as certainly afterwards, the destructive power of nature, held a place in the Pantheon, although regarded as the adversary of Osiris and thus of mankind, whom, however, he finally befriends. He seems thus to have a character of necessary evil. At length, after the Empire, he was expelled from the Pantheon. This may have been because the worship of Seth was repugnant to a reigning house of Asiatic origin, which might have held the Persian dualism which identified physical and moral evil. It may have been because Seth had been considered to be the divinity of the eastern neighbours of Egypt, and with their success and the fall of Egyptian supremacy had come to be thought hostile to that country. If this were the cause, the kings who proscribed his worship could have had no relation to the nations supposed to reverence Seth. In effect the change identified physical and moral evil and destroyed the earlier philosophical notions on the subject, besides introducing some confusion into the Pantheon.

Herodotus speaks of orders of gods, Manetho of divine dynasties. The explanation is to be found in the worship at each town of a cycle of gods. This cycle is called “the society of the gods,” or “the nine gods.” M. de Rougé does not admit the second rendering except as a plural of excellence (“Etudes,” Rev. Arch., n.s., i. 237). The number varies at different places and in different lists at the same place, but is always nearly or exactly nine. The Egyptians themselves explained this cycle as the selfdevelopment of Ra; the other gods were in this view his attributes (De Rougé, l.c. 236, 237; Rit. xvii. 2, 3). Two forms of the cycle acquired the highest importance as representing the systems of the learned men of Memphis and Thebes, the successive great capitals of Egypt.^[22. These Tιave been called the systems of Memphis and Thebes. The local cycle of Memphis was, however, not the system of Manetho which has been called Memphite, and has a distinct local character (Brugsch, Geogr. Iηschr., i. 237).]

The two systems are thus given by Professor Lepsius^[23. Shu, true spelling since discovered, is here put for Mm]:—
[table]

The views of Professor Lepsius on the origin and constitution of these systems, with such modifications as later researches have suggested, may now be given. We first observe that the two systems are but variations, and may be treated as one. They consist of male divinities, most of whom are associated with goddesses. These goddesses hold an inferior place, and are not to be counted in reckoning the number of the order, except perhaps Isis, whose importance is much greater than that of the others. An examination of the various forms of the two systems immediately suggests that they increased in course of time, Ptah and Amen, the chief gods of Memphis and Thebes, having been added for state reasons. The order thus reduced consists of two groups, the group of Ra, and that of Osiris. The group of Ra is wholly of solar gods, the group of Osiris begine with Seb and ends with Hathor. Sebek then stands alone, but he is w anting in the older lists, and is only an addition of the Theban system.

The solar group consists of Ra, or else Mentu and Atmu, and Shu. Mentu and Atmu are merely a division of Ra into his two chief phases, the rising and the setting sun, the sun of the upper and of the lower world. Both are solar divinities (Brugsch, Geoyr. Inschr., i. 254.) Shu, the solar light, is the son of Ra or of Mentu or Atmu; Tefnet, the goddess associated with him, is the daughter of Ra.

The Osiris group is not genealogically connected with the solar group. The central point of the group is found in Osiris, with his consort Isis and his opponent Seth. Seb and Nut are merely extensions of the group upwards. They are, however, spoken of as parents of the gods, showing that they represent the commencement of a series. Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Nephthys were usually considered their children, and Horus, the child of Osiris and Isis. Hathor is'associated with Horus, but her genealogical place is not clear. It is, however, certain that she is of the family of Osiris. The characteristics of this group are predominantly cosmic; this is true of the myth of Osiris, and consequently of the whole group, and is especially evident in the cases of Osiris and Isis, Seth, and Seb and Nut.

How did these two groups come to be united in a single series 1 Professor Lepsius argues that this was due to the influence of Thinis, the oldest Egyptian royal seat, from which the first historic king Menes came to Lower Egypt and founded Memphis. Thinis at a very early time merged into the more famous Abydos. Abydos was the great seat of the worship of Osiris, which spread all over Egypt, establishing itself in a remarkable manner at Memphis. All the mysteries of the Egyptians and their whole doctrine of the future state attach themselves to this worship. Osiris was identified with the sun, and the union of the two groups was thus not forced. Both had indeed a common origin. Sun-worship was the primitive form of the Egyptian religion, perhaps even pre-Egyptian. The first development was the myth of Osiris, due to the importance of Thinis, just as the rise of Memphis put Ptah, an abstract idea of intellectual power, even before Ra. So the rise of Thebes introduced Amen, who was identified in the form Amen-ra with Ra, and as. an intellectual principle placed before the physical solar powers. This argument derives great weight from the relative position given to the two groups, the solar divinities coming first, and from the circumstance that the religious reform under Dynasty XVIII. suppressed everything but material sunworship, as though this had been the primitive belief of Egypt.^[24. See Lepsius, Ceber den ersten A egyplisehen Gi>tlerkreis und seine geschichtlich-mythologische Bntstehungf Berl. Akad., 1851.] M. de Rougé, in his examination of the Egyptian Ritual, comes to a similar but more definite result in treating [9:7:716] of the mythological elements of the important seventeenth chapter. He traces the solar gods to Heliopolis, and considers the Osiris myth as probably derived from Abydos, and added at a later time.^[25. “11 est facile d’apercevoir, dans tous ces caractères, les symboles osiriaques, qui composaient probablement la doctrine primitive d’Abydos, se superposant aux emblèmes d’Héliopolis” (Rev. Arch., n. s., i. 359, 360). Μ. Mariette, on the other hand, writes “Originairement Osiris est le soleil nocturne, il est la nuit primordiale; il précède la lumière; il est par conséquent anterieur à Ra, le soleil diurne” (Mus. Boulaq, 1869, 100).] Professor Lepsius does not admit the Heliopolite origin of the solar group, on account of the small political importance of Heliopolis. Yet the circumstance that the chief divinities of that city, which had the sacred name Pe-ra, the abode of Ra, were Atmu, Shu, and Tefnet (∕A7. xviii. 4, ap. Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr. i i. 254, cf. 255) seems conclusive.^[26. Shu is, however, not mentioned among the divinities of Heliopolis in the great Papyrus of Ramses III. Records oj the Past, vi. 52 seqq.]

Some account may now be given of these divinities in the order of the lists, the later additions being noticed last and then lesser divinities. It will be impossible to give more than the simplest particulars, and many names in the Pantheon must be omitted altogether.

Ba, the sun, is usually represented as a hawk-headed man, occasionally as a man, in both cases generally bearing on his head the solar disk, round which the uraeus, symbolic of royal power, is sometimes coiled. His symbol is either the solar disk or the hawk. Ra had the most general worship of any Egyptian divinity, except Osiris. The worship of Osiris under his own name was more common than that of Ra under his, but this was in some degree compensated for by the union of Ra with other gods besides solar ones, such as Amen, Num, Sebek, forming the compound divinities Amen-ra, Num-ra, Sebek-ra (Lepsius, Erst. Acg. Gotterkreis), and by his being the type of sovereignty, so that each king was a Ra son of Ra. This importance of his worship was due to the adoption of Ra as the leading representative of the supreme being, from whom indeed he is sometimes undistinguishable in the Ritual, though - as already noticed this docs not seem to have been the primitive opinion, for there are evidences of his inferiority to the supreme god and to Osiris (De Rouge, “Etudes,” Rev. Arch., . ’ ι. s., i. 358). In the religious paintings lie is the supreme being, carrying on in his course a constant warfare with and triumph over evil, represented by the great serpent Apap, a tvholly evil being, not a divinity. His careeι resembles that of Osiris, but with notable differences. Ra is purely solar. He is rarely associated with any consort, and if so associated his consort is a female Ra (Lepsius, Erst. Acg. Götter· kreis). He is always victorious. He protects mankind, but has nothing in common with them. Osiris on the other hand is only solar because he is the beneficent power of nature. He is constantly associated with Isis. He has a life-long conflict with a maleficent power, his brother or son Seth, who is not wholly evil. Vanquished and killed he recovers his life and wins, but it is rather Horus his son who wins, and Horus, a sun-god, is the direct link with Ra in the Osiris family. Osiris protects mankind because his life resembled theirs: if he did not live on earth, at least his tomb was shown there. At Heliopolis two animals sacred to Ra were reverenced, the black bull Mnevis, sacred to Ra and Atmu, and the Phoenix (Bennu) sacred to Ra. Both are connected with Osiris, the bull by the worship of Apis at Heliopolis, the Plioenix as also representing Osiris (Brugsch, Geogr. lηschr., i. 257, 258). In addition the sacred Persea-tree was reverenced at Heliopolis.

In the attempt under Dynasty XVIII. to establish sun-worship in an original or ideal simplicity, the only representation is the solar disk with the uraeus entwined round it, and rays ending in human hands, one of which offers the symbol of life to the worshipper. The great sun-temple then founded contained no statue whatever (Lepsius, Erst. Aeg. OiiUerkrcis).

Mentu and Atmu may best be noticed together as merely two phases of Ra, representing, as already stated, the rising and the setting sun, the sun of the upper and the lower world. Their twincharacter is seen in the circumstance that Mentu was worshipped at Southern An (Hermonthis) and Atmu at Northern An (Heliopolis, the On of the Bible). Mentu, or Mentu-ra, is represented as Ra with the tall plumes of Amen, Atmu in a human form. Both cannot be distinguished from Ra except that probably their attributes were more restricted, and while Mentu seems to be within limits identical with Ra, the human form of Atmu may perhaps hint a relation to Osiris.^[27. In the 17th chapter of the Ritual the justified dead is called in his new condition Turn, equivalent to Atιnu. This may be merely because the word turn has the sense man, and may be thus a play upon the name of the divinity (c∕. De Rouge, “Etudes,” 350, 351), but it is more likely that Turn is here used as Osiris everywhere to indicate the divine quality of the justified.]

Shu is light, and is a type of celestial force, for he is represented supporting the goddess of heaven. Μ. de Rougé remarks that it is curious to find in this ancient cosmogony the principle of force identified with the luminous principle (“Etudes,” Rev. Arch., i. 235, 236). His figure is human and he sometimes bears on his head the ostrich-feather, which, though the initial of his name, must here have its symbolical sense of “truth.” The relation of light and truth is not less remarkable than that of light and force. Tefnet, associated with Shu in the cycle, is represented with the head of a lioness. This is the most common compound form of Egyptian goddesses, as the hawk-headed cf the gods. Both are connected with solar worship. The lioness was probably chosen as the highest foπn of the family to which the luminous-eyed cat, one of the most popular of the sacred animals, belonged.

Seb stands at the hea∣l of the family of Osiris. He is represented in human form like his cousort Nut. They are called ‘ ‘ father of the gods” and ‘‘ bearer of the gods.” Seb was the god of the earth (De Rouge, Ibid. 238), and Nut the goddess of heaven. Her name means the abyss, though curiously the primordial abyss is called, in ch. xvii. of the Ritual, ηu, in the masculine (Ibid. 359).

Osiris, in Egyptian Hcsiri, is usually represented as a mummy, wearing the royal cap of Upper Egypt, which may indicate the Thinite origin of his worship, or that, as Horus and Seth were the special divinities of Upper and Lower Egypt, so lie was particularly connected with the upper country. His cap is usually flanked by ostrich plumes, which probably have a reference to Ma-t the goddess cf truth and justice. The myth of Osiris is the most interesting because the most human part of Egyptian mythology. It is impossible to attempt a full account of it: the materials have yet to be gathered. We cannot accept the treatise On Isis and Osiris as representing the older form of the myth. In different documents we seem to trace irs growth, and notably do we find in those later than Dyn. XXII. the change due to the altered theory of good and evil. Yet the general outlines are the same in what we may ιeason-ably hold to be the earliest documents. It is these that are, as far as possible, used here.

Osiris is essentially the good principle: hence his name Un-nefer, the good being, rather than the revealer of good (Maspero, Histoire Ancienne, 38). Like Ra he is the creator, and like him in perpetual warfare with evil. His brother, or son, Typhon, Seth (Set), is his opponent. They are light and darkness, physical good and evil, the Nile and the desert, Egypt and the foreign land. Osiris is certainly moral good, Seth is to a certain extent moral evil. Throughout the Ritual they are in conflict for right and wrong, for the welfare and destraction of the human soul. In ch. xvii., which was preserved intact from a remote age, this conflict appears. Seth is, however, not there distinctly named as the opponent of Osiris, except in the glosses, which may be as old or (like the case of the Mishna and the Gemara) older than the text, and once in the text he appears as joining with Horus his adversary in accomplishing the final condition of the deceased who had reached the abode of happiness (ver. 35); and on the other hand, one gloss explains the executioner of souls to be Seth, but otherwise Horus the elder, brother of Osiris, who is but a variation of the younger Horas (ver. 33). Yet the opposition of Osiris and Seth is a perpetual combat. Osiris is vanquished. He is cut in pieces and submerged in the water. Watched by his sisters, Isis his consort and Ncphthys the consort of Seth, he revives. Horas his son avenges him, and with the aid of Thoth, or reason, he destroys the power of Seth, but does not annihilate him. The myth is a picture of the daily life of the sun, combating darkness yet at last succumbing to it, to appear again in renewed splendour, as the young Horus a solar god triumphs over Seth. It is also a picture of human life, its perpetual conflict and final seeming destruction, to be restored in the new youth of a brighter existence. In this view suffering is not wholly evil, but has its beneficent aspect in the accomplishment of filial good. There are two ways of explaining the origin of this myth. Either we may regard Osiris as the sun of the night, and so the protector of those who pass away into the realm of shades, or we may suppose that once taken as the type and ruler of mankind in the after state, the hidden sun was naturally chosen to represent him, the sun being with the Egyptians the source and governor of all life. Those who make the solar idea the first form of the myth have to explain its specially human aspect, and particularly why we see no such aspect in any deep sense in the case of Atmu the sun of rhe night in the group of solar divinities.

It will be easily seen how such a story took ho’d of the affections of the Egyptians. Osiris was the type of humanity, its struggles, its sufferings, its temporary defeat, and its final victory. The living, and still mere the dead, were identified with him. Under his name, without distinction of sex, they passed into the hidden ρlaco [9:7:717] (Amenti), the divine world below (Ker-neter), to be protected by him in their conflict with Seth and his genii, and to have their final state determined by him as their judge. It was to Osiris that the prayers and offerings for the dead were made, and all sepulchral inscriptions, except those of the oldest period, are directly addressed to him. As Isis is a form of the female principle, Osiris, the sun and the Nile, was considered in one phase to be the male principle. The Osiris of Mendes was the name of this form, which was more especially known by the name of Mendes.

The three most famous of those more sacred animals which were worshipped as individuals, not as a class, were the bulls Apis and Mnevis and the Mendesian goat. Of these Apis and the Mendesian goat were connected with the worship of Osiris. Manetho says that all these animals were first reckoned among the gods under a very early Egyptian Pharaoh, Kaiechôs, in Egyptian Ka-kau, second king of Dyn. 1I.^[28. Μ. de Rouge has noticed that the name of this king, “the male of males” or “the bull of bulls,” may be connected with the cultus of the sacred bulls, while that of Binδthris, his successor, contains a symbol, the ram, interchangeable with the goat, which makes it look like a second commemorative medal (Six Prern. Dyn., 243, 244). If this be so the names of these early Pharaohs must have been taken on their accession or on some remarkable event, like the throne-names after the introduction of that second name. A change of name during a king’s reign for a religious reason is seen in the case of the sunworshipping Amenoph IV., who took the name of Khu-en-aten.] It is very characteristic of the Egyptian religion that the reverence for Osiris should have taken this grossly-material form.

The bull Apis, who bears in Egyptian the same name as the Nile, Hilpi, was worshipped at Memphis. Here Μ. Mariette discovered a series of the tombs of these bulls, with tablets recording the reigns in which they were buried, and in several cases further exact particulars of date, thus affording important chronological evidence. Apis was considered to be the living emblem of Osiris, and was thus connected with the sun and the Nile, and the chronological aspect of both explains his being also connected with the moon. On the death of an Apis, a successor was sought for and recognized by certain marks. He was then inaugurated and worshipped during his lifetime. (See Aι ’ ιs. )

Sarapis, or Serapis, in Egyptian Hesiri-Hapi, is the defunct Apis, who has become Osiris. The great extension of the worship of Sarapis, after the importation of his statue by Ptolemy I., was merely a development of long existing Egyptian ideas. Hence the rapid spread and great popularity of this worship. (See Serapis.)

The Mendesian goat had no special name. He is called the Ram. He was considered an emblem of Ra and Shu as well as of Seb and Osiris, but probably he was chiefly sacred to Osiris, and in his solar aspect, which would thus introduce the relation to the more markedly solar gods. The seat of his worship was Mendes in the eastern part of the Delta, where Dr Bιτιgsch has discovered a very interesting stele of the reign of Ptolemy IL, Philadelphus, giving the history of the finding and inauguration of a sacred ram, and of the honour paid to him and to his temple. His worship was similar to that of Apis, but of a grosser form, inasmuch as the goat or ram was a symbol of the productive force of nature.^[29. Records of the Past, viii. 91 seqq., where the stele of Mendes is translated.]

Isis, or Hes, represented as a woman bearing on her head her emblem the throne, or the solar disk and cow's horns, is the female form of Osiris. Unlike Ra, the Osiris family have consorts; but no one is so distinctly as Isis a counterpart and of equal importance. Though the place of Isis is not as significant as that of Osiris in the myth to which they belong, she is necessary to it, and this is probably the reason why she attained an importance beyond the other Egyptian goddesses except only Hathor, who is but another Isis.

Seth, the Egyptian Set, usually called by the Greeks Typhon, is represented with the head of a fabulous animal, having a pointed snout and high square ears. He was the brother or son^[30. It has been usual to call Seth the brother of Osiris; Dr Brugsch prefers to style him his son (Hist., 2 ed. p. 20, 22). This double relationship is the key to the similar position of IIorus, and the identity of Hathor and Isis.] and opponent of Osiris, the divinity of the enemies of Egypt, and the chief of the powers which fought with the human soul in the after life. He certainly represents physical evil. It would be easy to account for his worship in Egypt were it not for his appearing as the enemy of gods as well as of men. There is indeed something illogical in his holding a place in the Pantheon, which gains consistency by his expulsion, though the consequent confusion of moral and physical evil was detrimental to ethical ideas. It is remarkable as showing the Egyptian notion of Seth while he was still worshipped, that in the Tombs of the Kings at Thebes, those whose names are composed with his, Setee I. and II., and Set-nekht, use instead the name of Osiris. This seems to have been sometimes done afterwards by a change in the inscriptions, but still at the time when the tombs were first completed, and thus while the reverence of Seth, as is shown by these royal names, was in full bloom (Lepsius, Erst. Aeg. Gotterkreis). The subsequent change of opinion as to Seth, his identification with moral evil, and his consequent expulsion from the Pantheon have been already noticed. In consequence his figure and name are usually effaced on the monuments, and other gods take his place in the cycles in which he had a position. In later times Seth is the enemy of all good, feared and hated, but no longer reverenced. The date of the change is as yet undetermined. It has been usually assigned to the Bubastite kings who composed Dyn. XXII. Μ. Mariette has discovered the curious fact that one of those kings, a hitherto unknown Osorkon, altered the figure of Seth in the legends of Ramses II. at Tanis to that of a Set-Ra (Musée Boulak, p. 273). Was this the beginning of the change?

Nephthys, or Nebti, the sister of Osiris and Isis, and conscit of Seth, does not, as far as the Egyptian documents tell us, share his character. It is rather as the sister of Isis that she there appears, aiding her in her labours to recover and revive Osiris. Thus like Isis she is a protector of the dead, and her figure and worship escaped the fate of those of Seth.

Horus, or Har, is in the cycles the son of Osiris and Isis. There is also a Horus the elder, Haroëris, Har-oer, brother of Osiris, and a Horus the child, Harpocrates, Har-pe-khruti, son of Osiris and Isis, and two other forms, Har-Hut, the Horus of Hut or Apolhno-polis Magna, and Har-em-akhu, “Horus in the horizon.” Horus is generally hawk-headed, and thus a solar god connected with Ra. This connection is perhaps strongest in the form Har-em-akhu, worshipped at Heliopolis sometimes even as Ra-Har-em-akhιι. The most interesting form is that of Horus as the son and avenger of Osiris. Osiris being identified with the sun of the night, Horus is naturally the sun of the day. From this identification arose the idea of an infant Horus as the rising sun. As Horus took the place of Osiris rn the contest with Seth, he became the elder Horus, to be on an equality with his opponent, who seems offener the brother than the son of Osiris. Specially Horus is the ruler of Upper Egypt, and the typical king of Egypt as much as Ra. It is indeed so hard to distinguish Horus from Ra that it seems impossible to hold any opinion but that they had their oιigiu in separate religious systems.

Hathor, Athor, or Hat-har, whose name means “the abode of Horus,” is hard to distinguish from Isis.^[31. Dümichen considers Hathor as the female principle to be identical with Isis (Bauurkunde von Dendera, 20).] She was worshipped with Isis at Dendarah (Dümichen, Bauurkunde del Tempelanlagen von Dendera, 3, 4) and Dr Brugsch even supposes the local goddess to have been Isis-Hathor (Geogr. Insehr., i. 202, 203), but this he has not proved, for the representations and titles are different for the twe goddesses (c∕ - . Dümichen, l.e.). The cow was sacred tc both Hath or and Isis, and both wear the disk and cow’s horns. Hathor in the form of a cow plays an important part in Amenti (cf. Dümichen, ibid. 21; Mariette, Musée Boulaq, 118, 119). Curiously she is more widely reverenced than even Isis. She is really the female counterpart of Osiris. She was, like him, worshipped throughout Egypt, and the great temple of Adfoo contains a list of over three hundred names of the goddess in heι local forms (Dümichen, ⅛f<f. 20). Still more remarkably, in late times, the cow, here the symbol oi Hathor, not seldom takes the place of the name of Osiris as applied to women deceased: instead of taking the form of Osiris, they take that of Hathor (Ibid. 21). It is characteristic of the Egyptian religion that this irregularity should occur, and we may well hesitate to attempt to define the place of Hathor in the Pantheon (Mariette, Musée Boulaq, 118), though Μ. Dümichen has made this endeavour in a very interesting passage, that could be accepted had he given sufficient authority from the monuments, and not shown traces of the influence of Greek interpretation, besides too great a tendency to reason on the negative evidence of the simple statements of the earlier monuments (Ibid. 20, seqq.).

Phtha, or Ptah, the Egyptian Hephaestus, is the first to be noticed of the divinities introduced into the chief cycles after their formation. His name is one of the Egyptian words which can be recognized letter for letter in Hebrew (∏ns “he opened, began,” and (Piel) “carved”); and the sense is similar. Ptah is thus the divine architect (ef. Brugsch, Histoire, 2d ed., 21). He was the chief god of Memphis, worshipped under a human form, sometimes as a pigmy, supposed to be an embryo. He was the creative force, but seemingly not as the sun. Though when connected with the local form of Osiris worshipped at Memphis under the name Sekeri-Hcsiri, and then called Ptah-Sekeri-Hesiri, he is sometimes hawk-headed, this is rather with a reference to Horas than to Ra. Perhaps Professor Lepsius’s view that he is put before Ra in the Memphite form of the cycle as an abstract idea of intellectual power is the true one. If so, it seems probable that the worship of Ptah was of foreign origin.

Ammon, the Egyptian Amen, “the hidden,” probably owed his importance to the greatness of Thebes, the chief Egyptian seat of his worship. He seems to derive his characteristics from his association with other gods. As Amen-ra he takes the qualities of [9:7:718] the sin; as Amen-ra ka-mut-f, “the husband of his mother,” he takes those of Min or Khern, the productive principle. Rarely he has the ram-headed form that Greek notions would lead us to expect.

Sebek, the crocodile-headed god, seems to have held a similar place to Seth. There may have been a time when he was reverenced throughout Egypt, but in the Graeco-Roman period he was a local divinity so disliked in most parts of Egypt that, as already noticed, the Arsinoiite nome where he was worshipped does not appear in the geographical lists. His sacred animal the crocodile was held in abhorrence and hunted wherever Sebek was not reverenced (c∕ - . Brugsch, IIish, 2d. ed., 106, 107).

Thoth, or Tauut, is the head of the second cycle in the two principal forms of the cycles. As the chief moon-god he thus takes an inferior place corresponding to that of Ra. He is generally represented as ibis-headed, and frequently bears the disk and crescent of the moon. He is the god of letters and of the reckoning of time, and thus sometimes lias solar attributes. The ibis and the cynocephalus were sacred to him. As the deity of wisdom he aids Horus in his conflict with Seth, and records the judgment of the deceased before Osiris. He appears in Phoenician mythology, though not at a period early enough for us to infer that his worship was not borrowed from Egypt. Yet it is not impossible that here, as in the case of Phtha, we have a trace of early Eastern influence. It is at least remarkable that the great seat of his worship, Hermopolis Magna, bearing in ancient Egyptian the civil name Sesennu, also Pe-seseuuu and Ha-sesennu, Eight, or the Abode, or House of Eight, is called in Coptic cyΛΛOYΓf> or <AJ1UιOYΠR (“ClfAY, two), where the numeral eight approaches the Semitic form (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 219). Was the change in the Coptic numeral due to an ancient form of the name of this celebrated city?

Ma-t, the goddess of truth, succeeds Thoth in a fragment of the list of the dynasties of the gods in the Turin chronological papyrus. She is characterized by the ostrich-feather, the emblem of truth, upon her head. She thus corresponds to Shu, holding the corresponding place. Thoth is called her husband ( Lepsius, K'onigsbuch, taf. iii. 22), but she is not his consort at Hermopolis (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 220). She is the daughter of the sun. Her place in the myth of Osiris is very important, for it is in her hall, where she is called the Two Truths, that the deceased are judged.

Anubis, or Anup, jackal-headed, probably held in one system the next place to Ma-t. He belongs to the family of Osiris, being called the son of that divinity. He presided over mummification. In the earliest sepulchral inscriptions the divinity addressed is Anubis, not Osiris. No reason has yet been discovered for this. There can be little doubt that Osiris was always intended, and that the earliest inscriptions, for some reason connected with the Egyptian reticence as to this divinity, address Anubis.

The four genii of Amenti were inferior divinities connected with embalming. They were called Amset, II dpi, Tiu-mut-f, and Kebh-senuf. The vases found in Egyptian tombs which bear covers in the forms of the heads of these genii were intended to contain the viscera of the mummy, as it was held to be of importance that every part of the body should be preserved.

The rest of the principal Egyptian gods may now be noticed as far as possible in the order of their importance. It must, however, be remembered, that we are likely to be misled by the abundant monuments of Uj>ρer Egypt, and the scantiness of those of Lower Egypt, and that therefore we cannot yet decide which were insignificant members of the Pantheon.

Chnuphis, or Khnum, represented with a ram’s head, and to whom the ram was sacred, is the soul of the universe, and thus is spoken of as the creator (Mariette, Musée Boulaq, 113). He was specially worshipped in Nubia, and at the First Cataract, with his consort Sati, the goddess of the inundation (Brugsch, Gcogr. Insch., i. 150, seqq). He is closely connected with Amen.

The Egyptian Pan, the god of Panopolis, or Chemmis, was Min, or Khem, the productive principle, a form of Osiris. He was worshipped at Panopolis with a form of Isis as his consort (Brugsch, ibid., 212, seqq.) It is remarkable that he was connected with Amen at Thebes, for the myth of Amen and that of Osiris are singularly apart.

Mendes, or Ba-neb-tet, is merely a local form of Osiris, lord ot Mendes, connected with the worship of the sacred ram, or Mendesian goat (Brugsch, ibid., 267, 268, 271, 272; Records of the Past, viii. 91).

Neith, or Nit, worshipped at Sais, identified by the Greeks with Athena, is one of the few goddesses who held the first place in local worship. From the idea of a supreme being, single and selfproducing, arose that of a female aspect of this being. Thus Khnurn is called, as representing this being, “the father of fathers, the mother of mothers” (Mariette, Musée Boulaq, 113). This would suggest the personification of a female principle. This principle seems specially represented by the higher goddesses, like Neith, who is called “the mother who bare the sun, the first born, but not begotten, born” (Brugsch, Geogr. Iuschr., i. 247). She wears the crown of Lower Egypt, where she was principally worshipped.

Pakht, or Sekhet, and Bast, are two forms of one goddess difficult to distinguish. They are both usually lioness-headed, though sometimes they have the head of the cat, their sacred animal. Pakht was worshipped at Memphis as the consort of·Phtha; Bast seems to have held a place at her city Bubastis like that of Neith at Sai's. The monuments identify Hatlιor with Bast, and Isis with both Pakht and Bast, Hathor being called “Lady of Bubastis,” while Isis is spoken of as “bringing misfortune as the goddess Pakht, bringing peace as the goddess Bast” (Champ., Not. Man. 192, aρ. Brugsch, Gcogr. Inschr., i. 276). Pakht and Bast thus represent a double nature, not unlike the two principles in the Osiris myth (Mariette, Musée Boulaq, 1106; Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr., i. 275, 276). Pakht and Bast were identified with Artemis (Brugsch, ibid., 224, 275).

Mut, the “mother/’ consort of Amen-ra at Thebes, is, as her name implies, another embodiment of the female principle, though not in so important a form as Neith, so far as our present knowledge goes.

Khuns, worshipped at Thebes as the son of Amen and Mut, is a lunar divinity wearing the disk and crescent of the moon, his hair being plaited in the side-lock of a child. Sometimes he is hawkheaded, and thus connected with the sun. As a divinity mainly lunar his inferior place is accounted for.

The goddess Suben, identified with Eileithyia or Lucina, was worshipped at the town Eilethyia. She was especially the mothergoddess, and the goddess of southern Egypt; her symbol, that of maternity, was the vulture (Mariette, Musée Boulaq, 121).

The goddess corresponding to Suben was Uati, or Buto, who was the protector of the north, and whose emblem was the uraeus serpent.

Onuris, or Anher, was the local deity of the ancient city of Thinis. His functions are not clearly defined.

Imhotep, identified by the Greeks with Aesculapius, was the son of I , tah and Pakht, and with them formed the triad of Memphis. He is probably the god of the sciences, and similar to Thoth (Mariette, iδicf. 117, 118).

The Nile as a divinity bears the same name as the sacred Memphite bull, Ηέρΐ, probably meaning “the concealed.” He is represented as a man with pendent breasts, to indicate the fertility of the river. A hymn to the Nile by Enna, who flourished under Menptah, the successor of Ramses II. (Dyn. XIX. ), shows how completely even an inferior Egyptian divinity was identified with the supreme god, and with the principal members of the Pantheon (Select Papyri, xx.-xxiii., cxxxiv.-cxxxix.; Maspero, Hymne au Nil, a critical edition, and Records of the Past, iv. 105, scqq., an elegant translation by the Rev. F. C. Cook).

The Egyptian divinities were frequently associated in triads, temples being dedicated to one of these lesser cycles, consisting of father, mother, and child. The child is almost always a son. 11 is extremely difficult to make out a local triad in several cases, where there were two chief local divinities, or where the chief divinity was a goddess. At Thebes the triad was Amen-ra, Mut, and Khuus; at Memphis, Ptah, Pakht or Sekhet, and Imhotep; at Oιnbos there were two triads, Sebek, Hathor, and Khuns, and Haruer, Tasen-nefert, and Pnebto-pkhrut; the triad of Nubia and at Elephantine was Num, Sati, and the goddess Ank-t; at Apollino-ρolis Magna, Har-Hut, Hat-liar, and Har-pkhrut; at Latopolis, Num, Nebuut, and Har-pkhrut; at Hernιonthis, Munt, Ra-ta, and Har-pkhrut; and Osiris, Isis, and Horus, throughout Egypt. The third member of the triad always belongs to an inferior rank, and is sometimes a child-god (khrut), as will be observed in the three cases in which Har-pkhrut (Harpocrates) occurs, and the similar instance of Pnebto-pkhrut. Much of our knowledge of the Egyptian triads is founded on late documents of the Ptolemaic and Roman temples, and it is possible that the idea may have not been as much developed in earlier times. The whole subject requires a careful investigation.

The Egyptian notions as to the cosmogony are too closely identified with mythology to be very clearly defined. It seems, however, that they held that the heavenly aby ss was the abode of the supreme deity, who there produced the sun and the moon as well as the rest of the Pantheon. Yet it is stated in one gloss in the Ritual that the abyss itself was the supreme deity, (c∕. De Rougé, “Etudes,” Rev. Arch., n.s., i. 235, seqqf The aspect of the passages of the Ritual in which these ideas are developed seems as if due to the attempt to introduce philosophical ideas into the mythology, as though the Egyptians had some notion of the origin of things independent of that mythology.

The worship of the Egyptian deities was public and [9:7:719] pιivate—that of the temples and that of the tombs. Every town had at least one temple dedicated to the chief divinity of the place, with certain associated gods, and usually, if not always, a living symbol in the form of a sacred animal supposed to be animated by the chief local divinity. The services were conducted by priests, and on occasions by the king, and by scribes, who sometimes formed a college and lived at the temples, the various duties of which required the services of learned men. It is probable that the common people had a very small share in the religious services, the most important of which took place in the smaller inner chambers, which could never have admitted many worshippers. The outer courts, and still more the great inclosures containing the whole group of temple-buildings, must, however, have been the chief public resort for business and pleasure. There were no other public buildings, or, apparently, market-places. Like the modern mosque, the temple must have been the chief centre of the population.

The worship in the tombs was not local. It was always connected with Osiris or a divinity of the same group, and had the intention of securing benefits for the deceased in the future state. It took place in the chapel of each tomb of the wealthy; and though properly the function of the family, whose members officiated, the inscriptions invite all passers-by, as they ascend or descend the Nile, overlooked by the sepulchral grottoes, to say a prayer for the welfare of the chief person there buried.

The sacrifices were of animals and vegetables, with libations of wine, and burning of incense. Human sacrifice seems to have been practised in early periods. The monuments do not mention it, but Manetho speaks of its having been abolished, at least at one place, by Amôsis, no doubt the first king of Dynasty XV1II. The reference is probably to some barbarous usage during the great war with the Shepherds.^[32. According to Plutarch, Manetho stated that human sacrifices were anciently practised at Eilethyia (De Is. et Osir. i. cap. 73); whereas Porphyry says, on the same authority, that Amôsis abolished them at Heliopolis (De Abstiη., p. 199). As, however, according to Porphyry they were sacrificed to Hera, who would well correspond to Suben, goddess of Eilethyia, not to any goddess of Heliopolis, it is probable that Heliopolis is an error for Eilethyia (Ήλιου τriκtι for Eιληθuiαs r0λfi, as in the other passage where this is a correction for lδιθυιαs ττ6xtι), but the two citations are very different. According to Porphyry, Amôsis substituted waxen figures for the victims. The figure called the “Bride of the Nile,” now annually thrown into the river at the cutting of the Can∙ιl of Cairo, is said to represent a girl annually sacrificed in former times.]

The origin and destiny of man in the Egyptian religion is now known to us on the authority of its own documents, which in the main confirm what Greek writers had already stated on the subject. The aspect of the Egyptian teaching is either that of a simple theory, which was afterwards mythically interpreted, or of a union of such a theory with a superstition existing side by side with it. In the famous seventeenth chapter of the Ritual it is possible, as De Rouge has done with extraordinary skill, to extract from the text a consistent theory which the glosses confuse by the mythological turn they give to the simple statements of the text. Notwithstanding this difficulty, it is sufficiently clear that the Egyptians attributed to the human soul a divine origin, that they held that it was throughout life engaged in the warfare of good and evil, and that after life its final state was determined by judgment according to its doings on earth. Those who were justified before Osiris passed into perpetual happiness, those who were condemned into perpetual misery. The justified took the name of Osiris, the judge, under which they indeed already appeared for judgment.

Had this plain outline been left unfilled by the priests, the Egyptians might have been credited with a lofty philosophy. Unfortunately, however, a thousand superstitions took the place of the attempt to lead an honest life. In the tombs we find every one who could pay for a sculptured record characterized as justified, every mummy already an Osiris. How was this determined? Possibly there was a council held, which decided that the deceased could be treated as one who was certain of future happiness. It is, however, more probable that the learning certain prayers and incantations, the performance of ceremonies, and the whole process of embalming, together with the charms attached to the mummy, and prayers said by those who visited the tomb, were held to secure future happiness. In reading the Ridual we are struck by the small space given to man’s duties as compared with that filled by incantations and charms. The human mind must have lost sight of the value of good and seized upon the multifarious equivalents which needed nothing to be done by way of either self-restraint from evil or active benevolence. Thus as we look at the documents we see a noble idea lost in a crowd of superstitious fancies; as we look at the Egyptians as they lived, we trace the effect of the indomitable good, and yet find it always greatly alloyed with evil. The Egyptian idea of the future state is the converse of that of Socrates. It is no little incident of human weakness, like the request to sacrifice a cock to Aesculapius, which injures but does not destroy a harmonious whole; a mere glimpse of truth is seen through thick mists peopled with the phantoms of the basest superstition.

In the long course of ages the Egyptian ideas as to the future state seem to have undergone changes, not in themselves, but in the manner in which they were regarded. The vast labour expended on the Pyramids, and their solid simplicity, are in striking contrast with the elaborate religious representations of the tombs of the kings of Dynasties XIX. and XX. So, too, the sculptures on the walls of the tombs of subjects of the earlier kings, representing the everyday life of duty and pleasure, give place to funereal and religious scenes in the later periods. These were fashions, but they show the changed mood of the national mind. It is only in a tablet of the age of the Ptolemies that Greek ideas assert their predominance in a touching lament addressed from the land of shades, which no longer speaks of active happiness, but in its place of purposeless oblivion (Birch, “Two Tablets of the Ptolemaic Period,” Archceologia, xxxix. 22, 23).

Laws and Government.— We are gradually gaining an insight into the Egyptian laws. This is principally due to M. Chabas, the third volume of whose Melanges Égyptolo- giques mainly consists of essays, nearly all by himself, on texts relative to the administration of justice under the Pharaohs. His general results confirm the accuracy of what Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch state on the subject. It was to be expected that their evidence would have been good as to matters which could not have been easily misunderstood, and which must in the case of Diodorus have been personally observed. In this matter the two sets of authorities may fairly be combined.

The government of Egypt was monarchical. It was determined as early as the rule of Dynasty IL, according to Manetho, that women could reign. Accordingly we find instances of queens regnant. Their rule, however, seems to have been disliked, and they are passed over in the lists made under Dynasty XIX., when, it may be observed, the royal family seems to have been affected by Shemite influences. The royal power can scarcely have been despotic, although under certain kings it became so. It is sufficient to compare Assyrian and Babylonian with Egyptian history and documents to perceive a marked difference. The earliest monuments indicate a powerful local aristocracy holding hereditary functions. Those of [9:7:720] the Empire (Dynasties XVTII.-XX.} scarcely indicate any such class. Even the princes are no longer a royal clan, but the children of the reigning sovereign. The whole system of government rests with the king, who appoints all the functionaries and dismisses them at his pleasure. Hence arose a vast and corrupt bureaucracy, to which the decay of Egypt may have been mainly due. At all times the country was governed by nomarchs and lesser officers. In the earliest period these were local magnates whose office was at least sometimes hereditary, and whose interest it was to promote the welfare of their districts. Under the Empire governments seem to have been mere places of profit given by favour and held by force and corruption, according to the Turkish method.

The laws were administered by judges appointed by the king. It is certain that commissions for an occasion were thus formed. We do not know that there were judges appointed for life; but it is probable that such was the case, as it must have been the duty of a class to be thoroughly acquainted with the written laws. A legal scribe may, however, have been attached to each commission.^[33. AI. Chabas has given the constitution of a tribunal under Dynasty XX. It was held at the great assizes of Thebes, and presided over by the poliarch, with nine inferior judges, including his three assessors, who were a royal controller, a majordomo, and another royal controller, the Fist prophet of Amen-ra and an inferior prophet, a royal scribe, a captain of cavalry, an ensign of the navy, and the commandant of the city. The last was the prosecutor, and was himself condemned by the other judges on the acquittal of the defendants Mélanges, iii. i. 131, &< ).] All the particulars of each case, though not necessarily submitted in writing, were recorded, and the decision was written. The process was conducted with great care, and the culprit examined on his oath. The punishments probably were not extremely severe. For murder, but not for manslaughter, death was the penalty. Adultery was severely punished, perhaps rather by custom than by law. Theft was rigorously prosecuted. For sacrilegious theft the criminal was punished with death. The laws relating to debt are not yet well known. They appear to have been complicated by a system of loans and pawning, and to have been subject to modifications. Of the tenure of land we know little. The temple-lands seem to have been held in perpetuity, and this was probably the case with private domains in the earliest period (De Rougé, Six Prem. Dyn., 255, note 1).

Army.— ~∖Nq know little as yet of the organization of the Egyptian army, but much of its arms and mode of conducting warfare. It consisted from very early times of foreigners as well as Egyptians. The Egyptian troops seem to have been a military caste, though not in the strictest sense, and to have had certain lands allotted to them. There were two main divisions of the army,—a chariot-force, in which each chariot contained an archer and a charioteer, and was drawn by two horses; and a force of foot-soldiers variously armed, chiefly heavy infantry, armed with shield and spear, sword, axe, or mace, and light infantry, with bow, and axe or falchion, as well as slingers. It may be noticed that fiint-tipped arrows were used in the chase. We know nothing of the military manoeuvres, but it is evident that the troops were drilled to move in formations, and that the art of besieging was as well understood as by the Assyrians, in the mode of attacking the enemy’s fort as well as in that of protecting the soldiers.

Manners and Customs.— The subjects of the walls of the Egyptian tombs and the hieratic papyri tell us much of the domestic life of the ancient people. The education in the earliest age seems to have been more manly and more simple than in that of the Empire, when the college of a temple or the miniature court of a great officer was the school instead of the estate of the landed proprietor. This system, however, gave almost his only chance of advance ment to a poor man’s son, for the very highest posts were open to the successful scholar. (Cy. Brugsch, Hist. 2d ed. 16, 17.) Circumcision was practised from the earliest times, but apparently not as a religious rite, and not until the earlier years of childhood had passed. Of the education of girls there is no indication, but, as they afterwards shared the public life of men, and even held posts of importance in the priesthood, it could not have been neglected. It has not been proved that the Egyptians had any definite marriage law. We find, however, that they married but one wife, who is termed the lady of the house, and shares with her husband the honours paid to the deceased. Concubinage was no doubt allowed, but it is seldom that we find any trace of children more numerous than those of legitimate wives could be. The family of Ramses II. is an instance of an Oriental household, and the fifty-two children of Baba, whose tomb is found at Eilethyia, may also be cited, though the term children may in this case include other descendants {cf. Brugsch, ibid. 176, 177). Ordinarily the aspect of the family is that which it wears in civilized countries. The women were not secluded, and, if they did not take the place of those of republican Rome, it was due to faults of national character rather than the restraints of custom. There was no separation into castes, although many occupations were usually hereditary. As there was no noble caste, there was nothing to prevent the rise of naturally able persons but the growth of the official class, which gradually absorbed all power and closed the avenues to success. The corruption of this class has been remarkably shown by the researches into the Egyptian administration of justice by M. Chabas, who cites lists of robbers of tombs and houses containing the names of scribes and priests, besides a higher grade of servants {Melanges, iii. i. 1 ⅛A,seq<p). There are other indications of the social condition of Egypt under the Empire in the complaints of the lower class against the brigandage to which they were subject on the part of persons who found means to interest the highest functionaries, and so escape merited punishment. At the same time it is to be remembered that they had the right of direct appeal to the king {Ibid. 173-216). This part of the picture of Egyptian life is strikingly like that of China, and the dislike of foreigners is consistent with the comparison. The lower class being uneducated, and for the most part very poor, was held in contempt by the higher, and this was especially the case with labourers and herdsmen. All handicrafts were considered unworthy of a gentleman, and even the sculptor and painter were not raised above this general level. The only occupations fit for the upper class were priestly, civil, and military, and the direction of architectural and other works which required scientific knowledge, not skill of hand. The servants were of a higher grade than the labourers: not so the slaves, who were generally captives taken in war.

The everyday life of the ancient Egyptians is abundantly represented in the pictures of the tombs from the earliest monumental age to that of the Empire. The rich passed much of their time in hospitality, giving feasts at which the guests were entertained in various ways. The host and hostess sat together, as did other married people, and the other men and women generally were seated apart. The seats were single or double chairs, but many sat on the ground. Each feaster was decked with a necklace of flowers by the servants, and a lotus-flower was bound to the head, on which was also placed a lump of ointment. Small tables were set before the guests, on which were piled meat, fruits, cakes, and other food, and wine-cups were carried round. Before the repast, hired musicians and dancers entertained the company, and often this seems to have been the sole object of invitation.
[9:7:721]

These two kinds of entertainment are precisely what are customary at the present day in Egypt. Among the amusements of the ancient Egyptians was witnessing the performance of various gymnastic feats. They had several games, one of which probably resembled draughts. Under the old kingdom the chief occupations of the rich seem to have been those of a country life, in its duties, the superintendence of husbandry, of the taking stock of flocks and herds, and of the shipment of produce, and the examination of fisheries, or again in seeing to the efficient work of the people of the estate who were engaged in any craft; and the pleasures of country life filled up the leisure. In ancient times Egypt had far more cover for wild fowl than now. Thus we see from the subjects of the tombs that the rich Egyptian was in the habit of going into the marshes in a canoe, generally with some of his children, to spear the hippopotamus, or more frequently to knock down birds with the curved throw-stick. In fowling, a cat was sometimes used as a retriever. At other times he fished in his pond3, or shot or coursed with hounds various animals of the antelope kind. Every rich man in the age of the Empire had a chariot, generally drawn by two horses, which he usually drove himself, standing up in it. The life of the ladies was not unlike that of the meu, except that they only joined in the sports as spectators. They seem to have passed their time in household matters, in visiting, and in the simplest country pleasures. Occasionally they rode in heavy cars drawn by oxen. Their manners appear to have been indolent and luxurious. Among the lower orders the lighter work usually fell to the women. Both men and women led hard lives, having scanty clothing and poor food; yet the genial climate, in which the wants of the labourer must always have been few, rendered their condition not so painful as one might suppose.

Language and Literature.— The language of the people was the Egyptian, the later form of which, after they had become Christians, is called Coptic. Comparative philology has not yet satisfactorily determined its place. There can be no doubt that it is related to the Semitic family, but it has not yet been proved to belong to it. The grammatical structure is distinctly Semitic, and many roots are common to the Semitic languages. On the other hand, the Egyptian has essential characteristics which detach it from this family. It is monosyllabic, and its monosyllabism is not that from which scholars have endeavoured to deduce Semitic, but rather such as would belong to a decayed condition. This monosyllabism is like that of Syriac. Dr Brugsch strongly affirms the affinity of the Egyptian to the Indo-Germanic as well as the Semitic languages (7Zt√., 2 ed. 6), but the former relation has to be proved. It has been supposed that the monosyllabism of the Egyptian is due to its having in part originated from a Nigritian source (Genesis of the Earth and of Man, 2d ed. 255, seqq.). Certainly this is a characteristic of some Nigritian languages, and the want of any large agreement in the vocabulary would be sufficiently explained by the changes that the languages of savage nations undergo from the absence of a literature. It can therefore scarcely yet be asserted with Dr Brugsch that the Egyptian has no analogy to the African languages (Z.c.), by which, no doubt, he intends those which have no Semitic element. The problem will probably be solved either by a careful study of all the African languages which show traces of Semitic structure side by side with those that are without such traces, or by the discovery of the unknown element in Egyptian in the Akkadian or some other primitive language of Western Asia, which cannot be called Semitic in the recognized sense of the term. During its long history the language underwent little change until it became Coptic. It had two dialects—those of Upper and Lower Egypt, (Brugsch, ibid.); and by degrees a vulgar dialect was formed which ultimately became the national language not long before the formation of Coptic. One curious innovation in the Egyptian language was the fashion under the Ramses family of introducing Semitic words instead of Egyptian ones. From the manner in which these words are spelt it is evident that the Egyptians at that time had no idea of a Semitic element in Egyptian, for they always treat them as foreign words and retain the long foreign forms. The chief change in Coptic was the introduction of many Greek words, especially to supply the place of religious terms eliminated from the vocabulary. The inscribed and written character of Egyptian was the hieroglyphic, a very complex system, which expressed ideas by symbols or by phonetic sigus, syllabic and alphabetic, or else by a combination of the two methods. From this was formed the hieratic, a running hand, or common written form of the hieroglyphic, principally used for documents written on papyrus. Its oldest records are not equal in age to the earliest hieroglyphic inscriptions, but probably it is not much later in origin. The demotic or enchorial writing is merely a form of hieratic used for the vulgar dialect, and employed for legal documents from the time of Dyn. XXVI. downwards. The Coptic is written with the Greek alphabet, with the addition of six new letters and a ligature, the3e letters being taken from the demotic to express sounds unknown to Greek. For further details see the article Hieroglyphics.

Much ancient Egyptian literature has come down to us, and it must be allowed that from a literary point of view it has disappointed expectation. What it tells is full of interest, but the mode of telling rarely rises to the dignity of style. So unsystematic is this literature that it has not given us the connected history of a single reign, or a really intelligible account of a single campaign. The religious documents are still less orderly than the historical. It is only by the severe work of some of the ablest critics during the last fifty years that from those disjointed materials a consistent whole has been constructed.

The most important religious work is the Funeral Ritual, or Book of the Dead, a collection of prayers of a magical character referring to the future condition of the disembodied soul, which has already been noticed. It has been published by Dr Lepsius (Das Todtenbuch der Aegypter) and M. de Rouge (Rituel Funéraire), and translated by Dr Birch (Bunsen’s Egypt's Place, n.). De Rougé, in his most interesting papers in the Revue Archéologique (n.s.), has done the utmost that a splendid critical faculty and an unusual mastery of language could achieve to present parts of the work in the most favourable form. Still it must remain a marvel of confusion and poverty of thought. Similar to the Ritual is the Book of the Lower Hemisphere. The other religious works and inscriptions are of a wider range. The temple inscriptions indeed are singularly stilted and wanting in variety; but the papyri contain some hymns which are of a finer style, particularly that to the Nile by Enna, translated by Canon Cook (Records of the Past, iv. 105), and that to Ra-Harmachis, translated by Dr Lushington (ibid, viii. 129) and Professor Maspero (Histoire Ancienne, 32, seqq.). The moral writings have a higher quality than the religious, if we may judge from their scanty remains. The historical writings fall into two classes according to their official or unofficial character. Those that are official present the worst form of the panegyrical style, the others are simple though wanting in method. The letters are of more interest, from their lively portrayal of ancient Egyptian manners. In works of fiction there is a greater degree of skill, and in the “Tale of Setnau” (Records of the Past, iv.) we even find touches of humour. Egyptian literature [9:7:722] is not without its merits, but it has that want of lofty ideas and of charm which is characteristic of the literature of nations which have written very much and have had no other means of addressing mankind.

Science.— Fresh information is being constantly acquired as to the knowledge of science possessed by the ancient Egyptians. Their progress in astronomy is evident from their observations, and still more from the cycles they formed for the adjustment of different reckonings of time. Their knowledge of geometry is attested by their architecture, and by a document on the lands of the temple of Adfoo; and the annual inundation must have made careful surveys and records necessary for the preservation of landed property. Very great mechanical skill must have been needed to move the vast blocks used in their buildings, sometimes for very long distances, in part by difficult landroutes, and then to place them in position. Considering the want of iron, and of any but the very simplest mechanical appliances, the achievements of the Egyptian architects are an enigma to modern science (Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed. 52). Chemistry and metallurgy had also made great progress. The hardening of the bronze tools with which they cut granite is a proof of this, and the manner in which Moses destroyed the golden calf is another evidence. Medicine and surgery were much studied, and the Egyptians were in those sciences only inferior to the Greeks.

Arts.— Of the arts architecture claims the first place, sculpture and painting being subservient to it among the Egyptians. Temple3 were not built to contain statues, but statues were set up to adorn temples, of which they were a part, and the walls were covered with sculptures and paintings which had a decorative purpose. The group of these arts may therefore be considered as a whole, and thus the principle they expressed may be best discovered. This principle seems not to have been accidental, but a deliberate choice. The country and climate afforded the best means of symbolizing the leading idea of the Egyptian religion in the material forms of art. Life after death was that idea, and it found expression in the construction of t0mb3 as lasting as the rocks on which they rested. The pyramid is the first form of Egyptian art, and modifications of its form, in truncated pyramids, are seen in the main outlines of all later edifices or excavations. The decorations were subordinated to the idea of commemoration, and thus every building was at once religious and historical in its purpose. To this the Egyptian monuments owe a reserved grandeur that is not affected by the symmetrical qualities of hieratic art nor by the use of strongly contrasted colours. The art is always dignified, and the colours, being seen either in strong sunlight outside the monuments, or in dim twilight within them, are never glaring. The effect is exactly what was intended, and would probably not have been produced had the art been more advanced. In the whole range of ancient art Egyptian may take its place next after Greek. Indeed in some instances it excels Greek, as when in animal forms the natural is subordinated to the ideal. The lions from Gebel Barkal, presented by the fourth duke of Northumberland to the British Museum, are probably the finest examples of the idealization of animal forms that any age has produced.

From these observations we may form some idea of the character of the ancient Egyptians. They were religious, but superstitious; brave without cruelty, but tyrannical; hospitable, but not to strangers. In dress they were plain, but luxurious in their ornaments; simple in their food, but given to excess in wine. With respect for family ties, they were careless in their morals. The women enjoyed great freedom, yet their character does not seem to have been higher than it is among their descendants, subject to the lowering influence of the hareem seclusion. Though the chief object of every man’s life was the construction of his tomb, and the most costly personal event was the funeral, the Egyptians were singularly mirthful, delighting in music and the dance, and so given to caricature that even in the representation of a funeral ceremony the artist cannot omit a ludicrous incident. The double origin of the race seems as apparent here as in their physical type and their religion. The generous qualities of the Shemite are being perpetually perverted by the inferior impulses of the Nigritian; and again the bright elements of the Nigritian character are strangely darkened by the shadow of the gloomy tendency of the Shemite.

The industrial arts were carried to a high degree of excellence by the ancient Egyptians. In weaving and all the processes connected with the manufacture of linen they have never been surpassed. Their pottery was excellent in quality and suitable to its various purposes, and their glass but slightly inferior to that of the Greeks. In the making of furniture, and instruments of music, vessels of metal, alabaster, and other materials, arms and domestic implements, they showed great taste and skill, and their influence on Greek art through the Phoenicians is undoubted, though they did little more than afford suggestions to more skilful artists of Hellas.

The Egyptians had a great variety of musical instruments, the number of which shows how much attention was paid to the art. Various kinds of harps are represented, played with the hand, and of lyres, played with or without the plectrum, and also a guitar. There are other stringed instruments, for which it is difficult to find a modern name. The Egyptians had also flutes, single and double pipes, the tambourine of various forms, cymbals, cylindrical maces, drums of different kinds beaten with the hands or sticks, the trumpet, and the sacred sistrum. The military music was that of the trumpet, drum, and cylindrical maces; but almost all the instruments were used in the temple services. It is impossible to form any conjecture as to the character of the music, unless we may suppose that with many of the old instruments the modern inhabitants have preserved its tradition. It may therefore be mentioned that they are ignorant of harmony, but have fineness of ear and of execution. The musicians often sang or danced while they played. The dances of both men and girls were of various kinds, from what may be called feats of agility to slow movements. The dancers were chiefly girls, whose performances evidently resembled those of their modern successors, and whose clothing was even more transparent or scanty.

Ceremonies.— We know little of the private festivities of the ancient Egyptians. In particular no representation of a marriage ceremony has yet been discovered on the monuments. The greatest ceremony of each man’s life was his funeral. The period of mourning began at the time of death, and lasted seventy-two days or a shorter time. During this time the body was embalmed and swathed in many linen bandages, the outermost of which was covered with a kind of pasteboard, which represented the deceased, in the form we call a mummy, as a labourer in the Elysian fields, carrying the implements of husbandry, the face and hands being alone seen, and the rest of the body being painted with subjects relating to the future state, and bearing a principal inscription giving the name and titles of “the Osiris, justified.” The viscera were separately preserved in vases having covers in the forms of the heads of the four genii of Amenti. The mummy was inclosed in a case of wood having the same shape, and this was again inclosed, when the deceased was a rich man, within either another wooden case, or more usually a sarcophagus of stone, sometimes of the same form as the mummy, but generally rectangular, or nearly so. The mummy was then placed on a sledge, drawn by oxen or by men, and was frequently taken [9:7:723] to the bank of the river, or the shore of a sacred lake, which was to be crossed in order to reach the place of burial. A sacred boat carrying the mummy, attended by mourners, was towed by another boat, and followed by others containing mourners, offerings, and all things necessary for the occasion {Ane. Eg., pl. 83-86). On reaching the tomb the sarcophagus was placed in a sepulchral chamber, usually at the bottom of a pit, and offerings for the welfare of the deceased were made in a chapel in the upper part of the tomb. One tomb sufficed for each family, and sometimes for some generations; and in the case of the less wealthy, many were buried in the sepulchral chambers of a single pit, above which was no structure or grotto. It has been already noticed that,according to Diodorus, every one was judged by a legal tribunal before the right of burial was permitted, and of this there may be a survival in the practice of the modern Egyptians, which prescribes that a witness muyt answer for the good character of the deceased before his burial {Modern Egyptians, ch. xxviii.). After the burial, offerings were made at stated times each year by the family, and the chief inscription begged the passer-by to say a prayer for the good of the inhabitant of the tomb. These customs led to many abuses. The maintenance of the costly prescribed offerings must have been most inconvenient, and for this and other purposes the burial-grounds were peopled by a tribe of hungry professional embalmers and lower priests, who made their living not only by their profession but also by fraud and even theft. Yet we must admire the generosity with which the Egyptians lavished their riches upon the most tender form of affection. They were repaid not merely by a natural satisfaction, but also by the wholesome recognition that there are unselfish and unproductive uses for wealth.

The last official return (1876) estimates the population of the various provinces as follows :—
[table]

Of the present population of Egypt, the Muslims constitute seven-eighths, and nearly four-fifths of that of the metropolis; and to this class, and more particularly to the people of Cairo, the following sketch of personal characteristics and customs will relate, save in some few cases, which will be distinguished from the rest.

Tn describing the personal characteristics of this remarkable people, Mr Lane, in the first chapter of The Manners and Customs of the Modern Egyptians (which was written just before European influence was felt in the country, and still deservedly ranks as the only book of authority on the subject), says :—

“In general the Muslim Egyptians attain the height of about 5 feet 8 or 5 feet 9 inches. Most of the children under 9 or 10 years of age have spare limbs and a distended abdomen; but as they grow up their forms rapidly improve. In mature age most of them are remarkably well-proportioned; the men muscular and robust; the women very beautifully formed, and plump; and neither sex is too fat. I have never seen corpulent persons among them, excepting a few in the metropolis and other towns, rendered so by a life of inactivity. In Cairo, and throughout the northern provinces, those who have not been much exposed to the sun have a yellowish but very clear complexion, and soft skin; the rest are of a Considerably darker and coarser complexion. The people of Middle Egypt are of a more tawny colour, and those of the more southern provinces are of a deep bronze, or brown complexion—darkest towards Nubia, where the climate is hottest. In general the countenance of the Muslim Egyptians (I here speak of the men) is of a line oval form: the forehead of moderate size, seldom high, but generally prominent; the eyes are deep sunk, black and brilliant; the nose is straight, but rather thick; the mouth well-formed; the lips are rather full than otherwise; the teeth particularly beautiful; the beard is commonly black and curly, but scanty. 1 have seen very few individuals of this race with grey eyes; or rather, few persons supposed to be of this race; for I am inclined to think them the offspring of Arab women by Turks, or other foreigners. The Fellaheen, from constant exposure to the sun, have a habit of halfshutting their eyes; this is also characteristic of the Bedawees. Great numbers of the Egyptians are blind in one or both eyes. They generally shave that part of the cheek which is above the lower jaw, and likewise a small space under the lower lip, leaving, however, the hairs which grow in the middle under the mouth; or, instead of shaving these parts, they pluck out the hair. They also shave a part of the beard under the chin. Very few shave the rest of their beards, and none their moustache. The former they suffer to grow to the length of about a hand’s-breadth below the chin (such at least is the general rale, and such was the custom of the Prophet), and their moustache they do not allow to become so long as to incommode them in eating and drinking. The practice of dyeing the beard is not common; for a grey beard is much respected. The Egyptians shave all the rest of the hair, or leave only a small tuft (called ‘ shoosheh’) upon the crown of the head From the age of about 14 to that of 18 or 20 [the women], are generally models of beauty in body and limbs; and in countenance most of them are pleasing, and many exceedingly lovely; but soon after they have attained their perfect growth, they rapidly decline.” The relaxing nature of the climate, and other predisposing causes, contribute to render many of them absolutely ugly at the age of 40. “In the Egyptian females the forms of womanhood begin to develop themselves about the ninth and tenth year: at the age of 15 or 16 they generali}’ attain their highest degree of perfection. With regard to their complexions, the same remarks apply to them as to the men, with only this difference, that their faces, being generally veiled when they go abroad, are not quite so much tanned as those of the men. They are characterized, like the men, by a fine oval countenance, though in some instances it is rather broad. The eyes, with very few exceptions, are black, large, and of a long almond-form, with long and beautiful lashes, and an exquisitely soft, bewitching expression—eyes more beautiful can hardly be conceived: their charming effect is much heightened by the concealment of the other features (however pleasing the latter may be), and is rendered still more striking by a practice universal among the females of the higher and middle classes, and very common among those of the lower orders, which is that of blackening the edge of the eyelids both above and below the eye, with a black powder called ‘ kohl. ’”

Both sexes, but especially the women, tattoo several parts of the person, and the latter stain their hands and feet with the red dye of the hinnè.

The dress of the men of the upper and middle classes consists of cotton drawers, and a cotton or silk shirt with very wide sleeves. Above these are generally worn a waistcoat without sleeves, and a long vest of silk, called kaftan, which has hanging sleeves, and reaches nearly to the ankles. The kaftan is confined by the girdle, which is a silk scarf, or cashmere or other woollen shawl. Over all is worn a long cloth robe, the gibbeh (or jubbeh) somewhat resembling the kaftân in shape, but having shorter sleeves, and being open in front. The dress of the lower orders is the shirt and drawers, and waistcoat, with an outer shirt of blue cotton or brown woollen stuff; some wear a kaftân. The head-dress of all is the turban wound round a skullcap. This cap is usually the red cloth fez, or tarboosh, but the very poor wear one of coarse brown felt, and are often without the turban. Many professions and religions, Ac., are distinguished by the shape and colour of the turban, and various classes, and particularly servants, are marked by the form and colour of their shoes; but the poor [9:7:724] go usually barefoot. The ladies wear a shirt and drawers, a very full pair of silk trousers, and a close-fitting vest with hanging sleeves and skirts, open down the front and at the sides, and long enough to turn up and fasten into the girdle, which is generally a cashmere shawl; a cloth jacket, richly embroidered with gold, and having short sleeves, is commonly worn over the vest. The hair in front is combed down over the forehead and cut across in a straight line; behind it is divided into very many small plaits, which haug down the back, and are lengthened by silken cord3, and often adorned with gold coins and ornaments. A small tarboosh is worn on the back of the head, sometimes having a plate of gold fixed on the crown, and a handkerchief is tastefully bound round the temples. The women of the lower orders have trousers of printed or dyed cotton, and a close waistcoat. All wear the long and elegant head-veil. This is a simple “breadth” of muslin, which passes over the head and hangs down behind, one side being drawn forward over the face in the presence of a man. A lady’s veil is of white muslin, embroidered at the ends in gold and colours; that of a person of the lower class is simply dyed blue. In going abroad the ladies wear above their indoor dress a loose robe of coloured silk without sleeves, and nearly open at the sides, and above it a large enveloping piece of black silk, which is brought over the head, and gathered round the person by the arms and hands on each side. A face-veil entirely conceals the features, except the eyes; it is a long and narrow piece of thick white muslin, reaching to a little below the knees. The women of the lower orders have the same out-dυor dress of different materials and colour. Ladies use slippers of yellow morocco, and abroad, inner boots of the same material, above which they wear, in either case, thick shoes, having only toes. The poor wear red shoes, very like those of the men. Among the upper classes, however, the dress is rapidly becoming assimilated to that of Europeans in its most preposterous form.

In religion the Muslim Egyptians are Sunnees, professing the creed which is commonly termed “orthodox,” and are principally of the persuasion of the Shàfe’ees, whose celebrated founder, the imam Esh-Shâfe’ee, is buried in the great southern cemetery of Cairo. Many of them are, however, Hanafees (to which persuasion the Turks chiefly belong), and in parts of Lower, and almost universally in Upper, Egypt, Mâlikees.

The civil administration of justice is conducted in four principal courts of judicature,—that of the Zâbit, or chief of the police; where trivial cases are summarily disposed of; the Divan el-Khedivi, in the citadel, iu which the khedive or his deputy presides, and where judgment is given in cases which either do not require to be referred to the two other courts yet to be mentioned, or which do not fall within their province; the Divan el-Mahkemeh, the court of the cadi (kàdee), or chief judge, who must be a Hanafee, and who was formerly a Turk sent annually from Constantinople, but is now appointed by the khedive, and paid a fixed salary of 4000 napoleons a year; and that of the muftee of the Hanafees, or chief doctor of the law, who decides all cases of difficulty. There are besides five minor mahkemehs, or courts, in Cairo, and one in each of the neighbouring towns of Boolak and Masr El-’Ateekah, from which cases are always referred to the court of the kâdee; and each country town has a native kàdee, whose authority is generally sufficient for the villages around. The Council of the ’Ulemà, or learned men, consists of the sheykh, or religious chief, of each of the four orthodox persuasions, the sheykh of the great mosque called the Azhar, who is of the persuasion of the Shâfe’ees, aud is sometimes its sheykh, the kàdee, and the chief (nakeeb) of the Shereefs, or descendants of the Prophet, with several other persons. This body was until lately very powerful, but now has little influence over the khedive. Cairo is divided into quarters (Hàrah), each of which has its sheykh, who preserves order among the people; aud the whole city is partitioned into eight larger divisions, each having a sheykh called Sheykh et-Tumn. Various trades also have their sheikhs or chiefs, to whom reference is made in disputes respecting the craft; and the servants have similar heads who are responsible for their behaviour. The country is divided into governments, as before stated, each presided over by a Turkish officer, having the title of mudeer, and subdivided into districts under the control of native officers, bearing the titles “Mamoor” and “Nâzir.” A responsible person called Sheykh el-Beled (or “sheykh of the town” or “village”) presides over each small town and village, and is a native of the place. It must also be mentioned that the Sa’eed, or Upper Egypt, is governed by a pasha, whose residence is at Asyoot. Notwithstanding the consistent, able, and in many respects commendable, code of laws which has been founded on the Korân and the Traditions, the administration of justice is lamentably faulty. As is the custom throughout the East, judgment in Egypt is usually swayed by bribes, and a poor man’s case is generally hopeless when his adversary is rich. To this rule there have been some notable exceptions, and the memory of a few virtuous judges is cherished by the people; but such instances are very rare. The moral and civil laws observed by the Muslim Egyptians, being those of El-Islàm, will be noticed elsewhere. A great abuse formerly existed in Egypt in the system of consular jurisdiction. Natives were compelled to sue a foreigner before the latter’s consul, and in nine cases out of ten lost their cause. Similarly it was very difficult for a foreigner of one nation to obtain justice against one of another nation at the latter’s consulate. This abuse has now been done away. At the instance of Nubar Pasha, and after the deliberations of a European commission, three Courts of First Instance at Alexandria, Cairo, and Ismaïlia, and a Court of Appeal at Alexandria, were established in 1876, presided over by mixed benches of Europeans and natives, the former being the majority, and employing a new code based on the Code Napoleon, with such additions from Muslim law as were possible. These courts decide all cases between the Government or native subjects and foreigners, and between foreigners of different nationalities; and there can be no doubt that they will exercise a great influence for good on the administration of justice in Egypt. It is to be hoped that in course of time they may supersede the old native system in all causes. At present they do but supersede the consular system.

It is very worthy of notice, that in Cairo, as in some other Muslim cities, any one may obtain gratuitously an elementary education, and he who desires the fullest attainable education may receive that also without the payment of a single fee, by joining a class of students in a collegiate mosque. The elementary instruction which most boys receive consists chiefly of reading, and learning the Koràn by heart; day-schools, as charitable institutions, abound in Cairo, and every town possesses its school; a trifling fee to the fikee (or master) is the only expense incurred by the scholars. Girls are seldom taught anything beyond needlework. The children of both sexes, except those of the wealthy, have generally a very dirty and slovenly appearance; and often intentional neglect is adopted to avert the effects of the “evil eye,” of which the Egyptians entertain great dread. The children of the upper classes are excessively indulged, while the poor entirely neglect their offspring. The leading doctrines of El-Islàm, as well as hatred for all religions but their own, and a great reverence for their parents and the aged, are early inculcated.
[9:7:725]

This deference towards parents cannot fail to strike every foreigner who visits Egypt, and does not cease with the children’s growth, presenting an example well worthy of imitation in the West. Circumcision is observed at about the age of five or six years, when the boy is paraded, generally with a bridal procession, on a gaily caparisoned horse, and dressed in woman’s clothes. Some parents, however, and most of the learned, prefer a quieter and less expensive ceremony {Modern Egyptians, chap, xxvii.).

It is deemed disreputable for a young man not to marry when he has attained a sufficient age; there are therefore few unmarried men. Girls, in like manner, marry very young, some even at ten years of age, and few remain single beyond the age of sixteen; they are generally very prolific. The bridegroom never sees his future wife before the wedding night, an evil which is somewhat mitigated by the facility of divorce. A dowry is always given, and a marriage ceremony performed by a fikee (a schoolmaster, or one who recites the Koràn), in the presence of two witnesses; the ceremony is very simple, but constitutes a legal marriage. The bridal of a virgin is attended with great festivity and rejoicing, a grandee’s wedding sometimes continuing eleven days and nights. On the last day, which should be that terminating with the eve of Friday, or of Monday, the bride is taken in procession to the bridegroom’s house, accompanied by her female friends, and a band of musicians, jugglers, wrestlers, ⅛c. As before stated, a boy about to be circumcised joins in such a procession, or, frequently, a succession of such boys. A Muslim is allowed by his religion four wives; but advantage is rarely taken of this licence, and very few attempt to keep two wives in one house; the expense and discomfort which polygamy entails act, therefore, as a restriction to its general adoption. A man may, however, possess any number of concubine slaves, who, though objects of jealousy to the legal wife, are yet tolerated by her in consideration of her superior position, and conceded power over them, a power which she often uses with great tyranny; but certain privileges are possessed by the concubine, especially if she have born a son to her master. Such slaves are commonly kept only by grandees, the generality of the Muslin; Egyptians being content with one wife. A divorce is rendered obligatory by the simple words “Thou art divorced,” and a triple divorce is irrevocable under ordinary circumstances. The hareem system of appointing separate apartments to the women, and secluding them from the gaze of men, is observed in Egypt as in other Muslim countries, but less strictly. Mr Lane {ibid. ch. vi.) says— “I believe that in Egypt the women are generally under less restraint than in any other country of the Turkish empire; so that it is not uncommon to see females of the lower orders flirting and jesting with men in public, and men laying their hands upon them very freely. Still it might be imagined that the women of the higher and middle classes feel themselves severely oppressed, and are much discontented with the state of seclusion to which they are subjected; but this is not commonly the case; on the contrary, an Egyptian wife who is attached to her husband is apt to think, if he allow her uuusual liberty, that he neglects her, and does not sufficiently love her; and to envy those wives who are kept and watched with greater strictness.” The females of an Egyptian household never sit in the presence of the master, but attend him at his meals, and are treated in every respect as inferiors. The mother, however, forms a remarkable exception to this rule; in rare instances, also, a wife becomes a companion to her husband. On the other hand, if a pair of women’s shoes are placed outside the door of the hareem apartments, they are understood to signify that female visitors are within, and a man is sometimes thus excluded from the upper portion of his own house for many days. Ladies of the upper or middle classes lead a life of extreme inactivity, spending their time at the bath, which is the general place of gossip, or in receiving visits, embroidering, and the like, and in absolute dolce far nicnte. It is therefore no cause for wonder that their tone of morals is generally low. Both sexes are abstemious in their food, though fond of pastry, sweetmeats, and fruit. The principal meals are breakfast, about an hour after sunrise; dinner, or the mid-day meal, at noon; and supper, which is the chief meal of the day, a little after sunset. Coffee is taken at all hours, and is, with a pipe, presented at least once to each guest. Tobacco is the great luxury of the men of all classes in Egypt, who begin and end the day with it, and generally smoke all day with little intermission. Many women, also, especially among the rich, adopt the habit. Men who can afford to keep a horse, mule, or ass, are very seldom seen to walk, and numberless excellent asses are to be hired in Cairo. Ladies always ride asses and sit astride. The poorer classes are of course unable to observe the hareem system, but the women are in general carefully veiled. Some of them keep small shops, and all fetch water, make fuel, and cook for their households. The food of the poor is very meagre; flesh meat is rarely tasted by them, and (besides bread) dates, raw cucumbers, and onions are their common food, with soaked beans, roasted ears of Indian corn, &c.

In their social intercourse the Muslim Egyptians are regular, and observe many forms of salutation aud much etiquette; yet they are very affable, entering into conversation with strangers at shops and elsewhere. Their courtesy and dignity of manner are very striking, and are combined with ease and a fluency of discourse. Of their mental qualifications Mr Lane(⅛ι'(Z. ch. xiii.) remarks—“The natural or innate character of the modern Egyptians is altered, in a remarkable degree, by their religion, laws, and government, a3 well as by the climate and other causes; and to form a just opinion of it is therefore very difficult. We may, however, confidently state that they are endowed, in a higher degree than most other people, with some of the more important mental qualities, particularly quickness of apprehension, a ready wit, and a retentive memory. In youth they generally possess these and other intellectual powers; but the causée above alluded to gradually lessen their mental energy.” Their principal virtues are piety and strong religious feeling, a strict observance of the injunctions of El-Islâm, and a constantly professed sense of God’s presence and over-ruling providence, combined, however, with religious pride and hypocrisy. Their common discourse is full of asseverations and expressions respecting sacred things, often, however, used with a levity which it is difficult for a person unacquainted with their feelings easily to reconcile with their respect for God. They entertain an excessive reverence for their Prophet; and the Korân is treated with the utmost respect— never, for example, being placed in a low situation—and this is the case with everything they esteem holy. They are fatalists, and bear calamities with perfect resignation to the Divine will. Their filial piety and respect for the aged have been before mentioned, and benevolence and charity are conspicuous in their character; poverty is therefore not accompanied by the distressing circumstances which too frequently attend it in Europe. Humanity to dumb animals is another virtue, and cruelty is openly discountenanced in their streets, even to unclean animals; this is, however, unfortunately wearing off in consequence of their intercourse with Franks. Their affability, cheerfulness, and hospitality are remarkable, as well as frugality and temperance in food and drink, scrupulous cleanliness, a love of country, and honesty in the payment of debt. It should [9:7:726] be added, however, that the Egyptians rarely, if ever, exercise their social virtues but towards persons of their own persuasion and country. Their vices are indolence, obstinacy, and licentiousness, especially among the women, cupidity (mitigated by generosity), envy, a disregard for the truth, and a habit of cursing. Murders, and other grave crimes of this nature, are rarely committed, but petty thefts are very common.

“The Arabic spoken by the middle and higher classes in Cairo is generally inferior, in point of grammatical correctness and pronunciation, to the dialects of the Bedawees of Arabia, and of the inhabitants of the towns in their immediate vicinity, but much to be preferred to those of Syria, and still more to those of the Western Arabs” (Lane, ibid. ch. ix.). The language varies in Upper and Lower Egypt, and is more correct inland than near the Mediterranean.

In the decay of Arab literature, Cairo still holds the chief place as a seat of learning, and its university, the Azhar, is undoubtedly the first of the Eastern world. Its professors teach “grammatical inflexion and syntax, rhetoric, versification, logic, theology, the exposition of the Kur-ân, the Traditions of the Prophet, the complete science of jurisprudence, or rather of religious, moral, civil, and criminal law, which is chiefly founded on the Kur-ân and the Traditions, together with arithmetic as far as it is useful in matters of law. Lectures are also given on algebra, and on the calculations of the Mohammadan calendar, the times of prayer, Ac.” (Lane, ibidj). The students, as already remarked, pay no fees, and the professors receive no salaries. The latter maintain themselves by private teaching, and by copying manuscripts, and the former in the same manner, or by reciting the Korân. The students are now said to amount to the number of 11,000. Except the professors of literature, few Egyptians are taught more than to read and write; and of these, still fewer can read and write well. The women, as before mentioned, are very rarely taught even to read.

Science is but little studied, and barbers generally practise medicine and surgery. Mehemet Ali endeavoured to improve this state of things, by sending young men to Europe for the purpose of scientific study, and by establishing various schools, with the same object, in Egypt. His improvements have been continued by the present khedive, Ismail Pasha, with some success.

In common with other Muslims, those of Egypt have very many superstitions, some of which are peculiar to themselves. Tombs of saints abound, one or more being found in every town and village; and no traveller up the Nile can fail to remark how every prominent mountain has the sepulchre of its patron saint. The great saints of Egypt are the imâm Esh-Shâfe’ee, founder of the persuasion called after him, the seyyid Ahmad El-Bedawee, and the seyyid Ibrâheem Ed-Dasυokee, both of whom were founders of orders of dervishes. The former of these two is buried at the town of Tanta, in the Delta, and his tomb attracts mauy thousands of visitors annually to his principal festival; the latter is also much revered, and his festival draws together, in like manner, great crowds to his birthplace, the town of Ed-Dasook. But, besides the graves of her native saints, Egypt boasts of those of several members of the Prophet’s family; the tomb of the seyyideh Zeyneb, daughter of ’Alee, that of the seyyideh Sekeeneh, daughter of El-Hoseyn, and that of the seyyideh Nefeeseh, great-grand-daughter of El-Hasan, all of which are held in high veneration. The mosque of the Hasaneyn (or that of the “two Hasans ”) is the most reverenced shrine in the country, and is believed to contain the head of El-Hoseyn. As connected with the superstitious practices of Egypt, dervishes must be mentioned, of whom there are many orders found in that country, the following being the most celebrated :—(1) the Rifâ’eeyeh, and their sects the ’Ilwâneeyeh and Saadeeyeh; (2) the Kâdireeyeh; (3) the Ahmedeeyeh, or followers of the seyyid Ahmad El-Bedawee, and their sects the Beiyoomeeyeh, Shaarâweeyeh, Shinnâweeyeh, and many others; and (4) the Barâhimeh. or followers of the seyyid Ibrâheem Ed-Dasookee. These are all presided over by a direct descendant of the caliph Aboo-Bekr, called the Sheykh El-Bekree. The Saadeeyeh are the most famous for charming and eating live serpents, Ac., and the ’Ilwâneeyeh for eating fire, glass, Ac. The Egyptians firmly believe in the efficacy of charms, a belief which is associated with that in an omnipresent and overruling Providence. Thus the doors of houses are inscribed with sentences from the Koran, or the like, to preserve from the evil eye, or avert the dangers of an unlucky threshold; similar inscriptions may be observed over most shops, while almost every one carries some charm about his person. Among so superstitious a people, with whom, as we have already seen, science is in a very low state, it is not to be wondered that the so-called sciences of magic, astrology in the place of astronomy, and alchemy in that of chemistry, are in a comparatively flourishing condition.

Since the time of the Turkish conquest, the arts in Egypt have rapidly fallen into decay; this is partly attributable to the deportation of most of the skilled artificers of Cairo to Constantinople by the sultan Selim, but it is mainly owing to the misrule of the Turkish pashas, who have successively domineered over this unfortunate country. Cairo contains the most splendid specimens of Arab architecture of any part of the Arabian empire; but at present new buildings are erected after the Constantinopolitan model, or, what is still worse, the purely European—both styles immeasurably inferior to the Arab, and very ill suited to the requirements of the climate. In like manner, every other kind of native art is gradually perishing; and it is to be feared that even should the people be relieved from oppression and bad government, their industry will be encouraged rather to adopt imaginary improvements imported from Europe, than to cultivate the beautiful taste of their ancestors. The manufactures of the present inhabitants of Egypt are generally inferior to those of other Eastern nations, their handicrafts are clumsy, and the inevitable results of tyranny are everywhere evident; nevertheless, the curious shops, the markets of different trades (the shops of each trade being generally congregated in one street or district), the easy merchant sitting before his shop, the musical and quaint street-cries of the picturesque venders of fruit, sherbet, water, Ac., with the ever-changing and many-coloured throng of passengers, all render the streets of Cairo a delightful study for the lover of Arab life, nowhere else to be seen in such perfection, or with so fine a background of magnificent buildings.

Among the luxurious habits of the Egyptians must be classed the immoderate use of tobacco (as before mentioned) and coffee. They are, however, rarely guilty of the vice of drunkenness, wine being prohibited by the Korân. Eaters of opium, and smokers of hemp, called hasheesh, are not uncommon, though they are always of the dregs of the people. The bath is a favourite resort of both sexes and all classes. In Cairo alone are upwards of sixty public baths, and every good house has a private bath. Their amusements are generally not of a violent kind, being rather in keeping with the sedentary habits of the people, and the heat of the climate. They are acquainted with chess, draughts, backgammon, and other games, among which is one peculiar to themselves, called Mankalah, and played with cowries. The game of the gereed requires great bodily exertion; aud wrestlers, Ac., are found in the country, though not in any number. Music is the most favourite recreation [9:7:727] of the people of Egypt; the songs of the boatmen, the religious chants, and the cries in the streets are all musical. There are male and female musical performers; the former are both instrumental and vocal, the latter (called , Almeh, pl. ’Awâlim) generally vocal. The ’Awâlim are, as their name (“learned”) implies, generally accomplished women, and should not be confounded with the Ghawâzee, or dancing-girls. There are many kinds of musical instruments. The music, vocal and instrumental, is generally of little compass, and in the minor key; it is therefore plaintive, and strikes a European ear as somewhat monotonous, though often possessing a simple beauty, and the charm of antiquity, for there is little doubt that favourite airs have been handed down from remote ages. The prophet Mohammad condemned music, and its professors are in consequence lightly esteemed by the generality of Muslims, who nevertheless scruple not to enjoy their performances, and resort to the coffee-shops and to private festivities, where they are almost always to be found.

The Ghawâzee (sing. Ghâzeeyeh) form a separate class, very similar to the gypsies. They always intermarry among themselves only, and are all brought up to the venal profession. Their performances are too well known to need a description here, but it should be observed that the religious and learned Egyptians hold them to be improper. They dance in public, at fairs and religious festivals, and at private festivities, but not iu respectable houses, whether before the men or the ladies. Mehemet Ali banished them to Isne, in Upper Egypt; and the few that remained, occasionally dancing in Cairo, called themselves ’Awâlim, to avoid punishment. A most objectionable class of male dancers also exists, who imitate the dances of the Ghawâzee, and dress iu a kind of nondescript female attire. Not the least curious of the public performances are those of the serpent-charmers, who are generally Rifâ’ee, or Saadee dervishes. Their power over serpents has been doubted by most European travellers, yet their performances remain unexplained; and apparently they possess means of ascertaining the haunts of these and other reptiles, aud of alluring them forth; they, however, always extract the fangs of venomous serpents. Jugglers, rope-dancers, and farce-players must also be mentioned. In the principal coffee-shops of Cairo are to be found reciters of romances, surrounded by interested audiences. They are of three classes, and recite from several works, among which was formerly included the Thousand and One Nights; but manuscripts of the latter have become so rare as to render it almost impossible to obtain a copy.

The periodical public festivals are exceedingly interesting, and many of the remarkable observances with which they abound are passing away. The first ten days of the Mohammadan year are held to be blessed, and especially the tenth; and many curious and superstitious practices are observed on these days, particularly by the women. The tenth day, being the anniversary of the martrydom of El-Hoseyn, the mosque of the Hasaneyn is thronged to excess, mostly by women. Following the order of the lunar year, the next festival is that of the Return of the Pilgrims, which is the occasion of great rejoicing, many having friends or relatives in the caravan. The Mahmal, a kind of covered litter, first originated by the celebrated queen Sheger-ed-Durr, is brought into the city in procession, though not with as much pomp as when it leaves with the pilgrims. These and other processions have lost much of their effect since ' the extinction of the Memlooks, and the gradual disuse of gorgeous dress for the retainers of the officers of state. A regiment of regular infantry makes but a sorry substitute for the splendid cavalcade < f former times. The Birth of the Prophet (Moolid en-Nebee), which is celebrated in the beginning of the third month, is the greatest festival of the whole year. During nine days and nights its religious ceremonies are observed at Cairo, in the open space called the Ezbekeeyeh. Next in time, and also in importance, is the Moolid El-Hasaneyn, commemorative of the birth of El-Hoseyn, and lasting fifteen days and nights; and at the same time is kept the Moolid of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob, the last king but one of the Eiyoobee dynasty. In the seventh month occur the Moolid of the seyyideh Zeyneb, and the commemoration of the Mearâg, or the Prophet’s miraculous journey to heaven. Early in the tenth month (Shaabân), the Moolid of the imâm Esh-Shâfe’ee is observed; and the night of the middle of that month has its peculiar customs, being held by the Muslims to be that on which the fate of all living is decided for the ensuing year. Then follows Ramadân, the month of abstinence, a severe trial to the faithful; and the Lesser Festival (El-’Eed es-Sagheer), which commences Showwâl, is hailed by them with delight. A few days after, the Kisweh, or new covering for the Kaabeh at Meecca, is taken in procession from the citadel, where it is always manufactured, to the mosque of the Hasaneyn to be completed; and, later, the caravan of pilgrims departs, when the grand procession of the Mahmal takes place. On the tenth day of the last month of the year, the Great Festival (El-’Eed el-Kebeer), or that of the Sacrifice, closes the calendar.

The rise of the Nile is naturally the occasion of annual customs, some of which are doubtless relics of antiquity; these are observed according to the Coptic year.^[34. It may be mentioned here that the period of the hot winds, called the Khamâseen, that is,“The Fifties,’’ is calculated from the day after the Coptic Easter, and terminates on the day of Pentecost, and that the Muslims observe the Wednesday preceding this period, called “Job’s Wednesday,” as well as its first day, when many go into the country from Cairo, “to smell the air.” This day is hence called Shemm en-Neseem, or “the smelling of the zephyr.” The ’Ulema observe the same custom on the first three days of the spring quarter.] The commencement of the rise is fixed to the night of the 11th of Ba-ooneh (Payni), the 17th of June, and is called that of the Drop (Leylet en-Nuktah), because a miraculous drop is then supposed to fall, and cause the swelling of the river. The real rise commences at Cairo about the summer solstice, or a few days later; and on about the 3d of July a crier in each district of the city begins to go his daily rounds, announcing, in a quaint chant, the increase of water in the Nilometer of the island of Er-R<5dah. When the river has risen 20 or 21 feet, he proclaims the Wefà en-Neel, “Completion” or “Abundance of the Nile.” On the following day, the dam which closes the canal of Cairo is cut with much ceremony, and this is the signal for letting the inundation over the surface of the country. A pillar of earth before the dam is called the “Bride of the Nile,” and Arab historians relate that this was substituted, at the Muslim conquest, for a virgin whom it was the custom annually to sacrifice, to ensure a plentiful inundation. A large boat, gaily decked out, representing that in which the victim used to be conveyed, is anchored near, and a gun on board is fired every quarter of an hour during the night. Rockets and other fireworks are also let off, but the best, strangely, after daybreak. The governor of Cairo attends the ceremony of cutting the dam, with the kâdee aud others. The crier continues his daily rounds, with his former chant, excepting on the Coptic New-Year's Day, when the cry of the Wefà is repeated, until the Saleeb, or Discovery of the Cross, the 26th or 27th of September, at which period, the river having attained its greatest height, he concludes his annual employment with another chant, and presents to each house some limes and other fruit, and dry lumps of Nile mud.
[9:7:728]

This brief account of the modern Egyptians would be incomplete without a few words concerning the rites attendant on death. The corpse is immediately turned towards Mecca, and the females of the household, assisted by hired mourners, commence their peculiar wailing, while fikees recite portions of the Koran. The funeral takes place on the day of the death, if that happen in the morning; otherwise on the next day. The corpse, having been washed and shrouded, is placed in an open bier, covered with a cashmere shawl, in the case of a man; or in a closed bier, having a post in front, on which are placed female ornaments, in that of a woman or child. The funeral procession is headed by men called “Yemeneeyeh,” chanting the profession of the faith, followed by male friends of the deceased, and a party of schoolboys, also chanting, generally from a poem descriptive of the latter state. Then follows the bier, borne on the shoulders of friends, who are relieved by the passers-by, such an act being deemed highly meritorious. On the way to the cemetery the corpse is generally, in Cairo, in the case of the northern quarters of the city, carried either to the Hasaneyn, or, if the deceased be one of the ’Ulemà, to the Azhar; or, in the case of the southern quarters, to the seyyideh Zeyneb, or some other revered mosque. Here the funeral service is performed by the imâm, or minister of the mosque, and the procession then proceeds to the tomb. In the burials of the rich, water and bread are distributed to the poor at the grave; and sometimes a buffalo or several buffaloes are slaughtered there, and the flesh given away. The tomb is always a vault, surmounted by an oblong stone monument, with a stele at the head and feet; and a cupola, supported by four walls, covers the whole in the case of sheykhs’ tombs and those of the wealthy. During the night following the interment, called the Night of Desolation, or that of Solitude, the soul being believed to remain with the body that one night, fikees are engaged at the house of the deceased to recite various portions of the Korân, and, commonly, to repeat the first clause of the profession of the faith, “There is no deity but God,” three thousand times. The women alone put on mourning attire, by dyeing their veils, shirts, <fcc., dark blue, with indigo; and they stain their hands, and smear the walls, with the same colour. Everything in the house is also turned upside down. The latter customs are not, however, observed on the death of an old man. At certain periods after the burial, a khatmeh, or recitation of the whole of the Korân, is performed, and the tomb is visited by the female relations and friends of the deceased. The women of the fellâheen (or peasants) of Upper Egypt observe some strange dances, &c., at funerals, w hich must be regarded as partly relics of ancient Egyptian customs.

For further information see, in addition to Lane’s Modern Egyptians, his translation of the Thousand and One Hights, and particularly the notes to it, and the Englishwoman in Egypt, by Mrs Poole.

The native Christians of Egypt, or Copts, are chiefly descended from the ancient Egyptian race; and, as they rarely marry with other races, they preserve in their countenances a great resemblance to the representations of the tombs and temples. Their dress and customs are very similar to those of the Muslim Egyptians, but their reserve towards persons of another persuasion renders a knowledge of their peculiar observances exceedingly difficult. The causes which produced the separation of their church, and the persecutions they suffered, will be noticed in the historical portion of this article. Under Mehemet Ali they were relieved of mi ch oppression, and the immunities then granted to them they still enjoy. The neglected appearance of their houses, and their want of personal cleanliness, are in strong contrast to the opposite habits of the Muslims, and European residents generally prefer the latter as domestic servants.

The Jews, of whom there have always been great numbers in Egypt, appear to be even more degraded there than in other countries. They are held in the utmost abhorrence by the dominant race, and often are treated with much cruelty and oppression. Many are bankers and moneychangers, <tc. The quarter of the Jews in Cairo is exceedingly filthy, and would give a stranger the notion that they labour under great poverty. But such is not the case; the fear of the Muslims induces them to adopt this outward show of misery, while the interiors of many of their houses are very handsome and luxurious. (e. s. p. —s. r. p.)]

Chronology and History.

Before giving a sketch of the history of Egypt it is necessary to speak of Egyptian chronology. The difficulty of this subject has increased with the new information of the monuments. The statements of ancient writers were easily reconciled with half knowledge, but better information shows discrepancies which are in most instances beyond all present hope of solution. It may be said that we know something of the outlines of the technical part of Egyptian chronology; but its historical part is in a great measure mere conjecture before the times when we can check the Egyptian lists by their synchronisms with Hebrew and Assyrian history.

Dr Brugsch, in the second edition of his Histoire d'Égypte, frankly admits the growing difficulty of Egyptian chronology in terms which account for his not having continued his Matériaux pour servir à la reconstruction du Calendrier, the opinions of which are modified in the later work. Baron Bunsen completed his Egypt's Place, but in the progress of the work made a great change in his theories. Professor Lepsius alone has maintained his views, as stated in the Chronologie and Konigsbuch, of which the general correctness has not been disproved, although in any new work it would be necessary greatly to modify the details. The words, already referred to, of Dr Brugsch, which close the introduction to his History (2d ed.), may be cited in justification of the differences between the present article and that of the last edition of the Encyclopaedia. “En comparant cette édition avec la première, le lecteur impartial reconnaîtra facilement que nous avons remanié complètement le premier travail, et de plus, que nous nous sommes abstenu de fournir des hypothèses auxquelles seulement le temps et des découvertes futures pourront substituer les faits” (p. 3).

The Egyptians divided the civil day into 24 hours, 12 of the natural day and 12 of the night, counted from 1 to 12 during each period. Ordinarily the civil day began during the night, which was indifferently reckoned as belonging to the preceding or following day. Probably the beginning was at midnight. In the astronomical tables of the Tombs of the Kings the civil day probably begins with the night, and the reckoning is from the first hour, or six hours before midnight. The indication is, however, not conclusive, as the tables are of nights only, but one term used makes it highly probable (Brugsch, Matériaux, 103). We also find the so. called heliacal rising of Sothis indicated as marking the beginning of the New Year, but this may merely denote that the phenomenon characterized New Year’s day of the original Egyptian year, or of the fixed year, not that tire civil day began with the 11th hour of night (c∕. Id., 99 seqg.; Ideler, Handbuch der Chronologie, i. 100-102).

The Egyptian month was of thirty days. The months are usually known by Greek names occurring in Greek documents, which were taken from the cultus connected with the months, and are thus the Egyptian sacred names. They are 1. Thoth, 2. Phaophi, 3. Athyr, 4. Choiak, 5. Tybi, 6. Mechir, 7. Phamenoth, 8. Pharmuthi, 9. Pachon, 10. Payni, 11. Epiphi, 12. Mesori, after which came the five Epagomenae. The names λvere applied to the Vague and Alexandrian years. The ancient Egyptians had a different system · of names. With them the months were allotted to three great seasons of four months each, of which the months were called 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. These seasons are called “sha,” inundation, “per,” winter, and “sheiua’ summer. The second and third [9:7:729] renderings are undoubted; the first, which is that of Dr Bmgsch, is not certain. If, however, it was so, we should have a difficulty in deciding to exactly which four months each season applied. It may be remarked that, according to the Copts, there are four months from the supposed beginning of the rise of the Nile, a few days before the summer solstice, to the end of the inundation. If this were the ancient reckoning, and the rendering “inundation” be correct, “winter” would be the cold season, and “summer” would correspond to spring and early summer. In support of this hypothesis it may bo observed that the so-called heliacal rising ot Sothis on the 20th of July marked the beginning of the Egyptian year, although in the year commonly in use this phenomenon passed through all the seasons, and further that in the earliest times of Egyptian history this phenomenon occurred about the time of the summer solstice, and the conventional beginning of the rise of the Nile, the three phenomena probably marking the beginning of the first season when the calendar was instituted^[35. If the agreement of the sidereal and tropical phenomena marked the institution of the year, a very remote d∙τte would be needed, but we cannot tell how nearly accurate the earliest observations were, nor do we know where they were made, and this in the case of the rising of Sothis is an additional element of unceιtainty.] {cf. on the seasons, Brugsch, Matériaux, 34 seqq.).

The common year of the ancient Egyptians is that which has been called the Vague Year, because on account of its length of 365 days it fell short of a tropical or a sidereal year, and thus passed through all the seasons. That this year was that in which the inscriptions are usually dated before the introduction of the Alexandrian year under Augustus appears from the Decree of Canopus (Hierog. 1. 18, Greek 1. 36, 37).

The Egyptians also used a fixed year dated from the so-called heliacal rising of Sothis, July 20. It contained 365 days, and was adjusted by the addition of another day for every four years. It is uncertain how far back this year was in use. The Calendar of Medeenet IIaboo, of the time of Ramses III., begins with the rising of Sothis, or, if wc accept Dr Brugsch’s explanation, withits festival (Jfα⅛rtαt∞, p. 84). Perhaps at the time of this monument the phenomenon fell on the 1st Thoth of the vague year, or within the month; or if. the festival be intended, it may be used as a conventional indication of New Year’s day in a typical form {Ibid. p. 84, 85). In the Roman period, after the Alexandrian year had come into use, there are double dates in the Alexandrian and Sothiac calendars, but the common Egyptian notation of the months does not appear to have been usually applied to the Sothiac year. An exception is noticed by Dr Brugsch {Ibid. p. 93), and another instance in which the month-name Tybi appears to be used for the Sothiac calendar, while an Alexandrian name is employed for the corresponding month of the Alexandrian calendar {Ibid. p. 92, 17. See on the whole subject, Brugsch, Matériaux).

The inconvenience of the vague year in relation to the festivals, on account of their connection with natural phenomena, led Ptolemy 111. Euergetes to reform the calendar by intercalating a day after every fourth year before the year next following (Decree oi Canopus, Hierog. 1. 22, Greek 1. 43-45). Obviously this arrest of the common year was more convenient than the change to a fixed year already in use beginning at a different season. This new style was abandoned and the old resumed, but how soon we do not know.

Under Augustus a fixed year, called the Alexandrian, beginning on the 29-30th August of the Julian year, superseded the vague year. According to Lepsius, the Era of Augustus at Alexandria dated B.c. 30, but the first year of the new calendar, prolepti-cally, B.c. 26, when the 1st Thoth vague corresponded to 30th August of the proleptic year of Augustus. The new reckoning, however, in his opinion could not have been introduced before B.c. 8, and was probably introduced A.n. 5. (See Lepsius, Ueber einige Berührungspunkte der Aegyptischcn, Griechischen, und Römischen Chronologie, Berl. Akad., 1859). Although it is quite possible that Augustus adopted a proleptic synchronism of the Egyptian and Roman years for the official Egyptian year, thus dating back his reform, yet it is more probable that there was some sj>ecial reason for choosing the particular Egyptian year selected, which, moreover, was not the first of the Era of Augustus. Brugsch has put forward a theory, which is the more remarkable in its bearing on this question as it is of wholly independent origin. He has shown reasons for supposing that a year beginning on the 25-29th August was in use in Egypt from the time of Dynasty VI. It must be admitted that many of his correspondences are of the Roman period, and therefore probably refer to the Alexandrian year; but others cannot be so explained, and it seems probable that the year which under Augustus superseded the vague year was already in use long before {Matériaux, p. 17 scq.). The Alexandrian year superseded the vague year, and has remained in use to our times, never having been wholly supplanted by the lunar year of the Arabs; but it has now given way to the Gregorian calendar.

At the time of Dynasty XII. the Egyptians used four years. These Dr Brugsch holds to be the vague year, a solar year, a lunar year, and a lunar year with an intercalation {Hist., 2nd ed. 98-99). The second of these years no doubt was the Sothiac, the beginning of which had an original connection with the summer solstice, and the duration of which was probably the Egyptian measure of a solar year. The lunar years would seem to be true lunar years, if we are to accept Μ. Gensler’s theory that the Egyp tians had discovered a method of adjusting their solar calendar with a lunar year by the intercalation of a month eleven times in thirty years {Id. 73). That the Egyptians at a later time used four years is evident from the Calendar of Isnè, in which three beginnings are mentioned, that which stands at the head of the document and is of the Sothiac year, a beginning of the “year of the ancients” on the 9th of Thotlι, and another New Year’s day on the 26th of Payni (Brugsch, Matériaux, 19-22). This calendar is attributed by Lepsius to the reign of Claudius, but Brugsch can only decide that it is of the Roman period {Id. 88, cf. 22). If it is much later than the time fixed by Lepsius, the second commencement may be of the vague year, which began July 28 in a.d. 101-104. It is not probable that it is earlier than the introduction of the Alexandrian year, which, however, is unnoticed. Thus at least four years were probably in use in Egypt under the Romans.

No Era has been found in the Egyptian inscriptions. They always, if they date at all, date by the year of the reigning sovereign. There is but one instance of a reckoning of the nature of an era. It is the statement of the interval between two distant reigns in the stele in which, under Ramses 11., an interval of four hundred years after a Shepherd king is mentioned, or more strictly, following the analogy of ordinary dates, the 400th year of the earlier king, as though he were still living. This, however, is not a strictly Egyptian document {Records of the Past, iv. 36). Similarly the coins of the Ptolemies, except one class, present no era; even those bearing the name of Ptolemy Soter, struck in Palestine and Phoenicia under Ptolemy Philadelphus and Ptolemy Euergetes, are dated by the regnal years of the kings who struck them. Theιe are indeed coins dated by an era, probably struck at some town of Phoenicia, but these follow a foreign usage which otherwise is not found in the foreign coinage of the Ptolemies. It is therefore not surprising that the Egyptian cycles mentioned by ancient writers are not traceable on the monuments. One of these, the Sothiac Cycle, consisting of 1460 Sothiac and 1461 vague years, or the period in which the vague year passed through one Sothiac year, was probably used by the astronomers, but we have no indication of its having been known earlier than the first century b.c., when Geminus writes that the Egyptian festivals pass through the whole year in 1460 years {Isag., c. 6, Petav., Uranologium, 33). Censorinus fixes the beginning of a Sothiac cycle in A.D. 139 (c. 21), in the third vague year or second Alexandrian of the reign of Antoninus Pius. Curiously the Alexandrian coin commemorating in a symbolic manner this event is of the sixth year of this emperor. Theon, writing during the cycle beginning a.d. 139, speaks of the previous period as the Era of Menoplirês {ap. Biot, Rech, sur plus. p. de l'astr., p.181 seq., Sitëscq.; Sur lapérwdc Soth. 18, 129 scqq.) It is therefore generally supposed that a cycle beginning b.c. 1322 commenced in the reign of a Menptah, usually identified with the king of that name of Dynasty XIX. This is possible but not certain. Other cycles rest on less distinct evidence, and for the present we must be content to accept Brugsch’s cautious judgment on the whole subject.^[36. “Il y a eudes savants qui ont cru découvrir un autre expédient pour fixer plusieurs dates de l'histoire d'Égypte en se servant du calcul astronomique. Le règne d’un roi Ménophrès sous lequel, d’apiès une tradition des anciens, une nouvelle période sothiaque a recommencé, après la date du lever de l’étoile Sirius, la Sothis des Egyptiens, rapportée sous trois rois du nom de Ramsès sur des monuments contemporains de leur époque, et à la fin quelques autres indications de nature astronomique, ont donné lieu à des calculs tiès-compliqués sans que 1:· critique ait dit son dernier mot sur leur valeur historique.” tIRst., 2nd ed. 27.)]

The historical chronology of ancient Egypt if less obscure than the technical is even fuller of difficulty. Our chief authorities are— (1) the Egyptian historian Manetho, who gave a list of thirty dynasties, and the length of each, with in some cases the duration of the individual reigns, (2) the similar list of the Turin Papyrus of Kings, and (3) various data of the monuments. Manetho’s list is unhappily in a veιy cormpt condition. It appears, however, that his method is generally not strictly chronological. As far as we know, he makes up the sum of each dynasty, except Dynasty XI I., of the individual reigns, where these are stated, taking no account of the overlapping of some of them. He seems to have given larger sums in three great groups. These again are made up of the sums of dynasties, and if any were in part or wholly contemporary, they are treated as successive. According to Syncellus, he stated the duration of the dynasties tobe 3555 years. If this number, which suspiciously enough is given apart from the dynastic list, came down correctly to the Byzantine chronographer, many hundred years must be cut off' from the totals of the dynasties as they now stand for contemporary dynasties or kings. The Turin Papyrus is unfortunately in a far worse state than Manetho’s list, but it is valuable as confirming and correcting it. The system of reckoning seems, however, to have been more strictly chronological than Manetho’s usual method. The various data of⅛he monuments are as yet of little value beyond affording evidence that Manetho’s numbers [9:7:730] must be reduced, and as supplying fragments of historical chronology which may ultimately be united into a complete system. It has indeed been supposed that they enable us to construct an approximative chronology on genealogical evidence. This system, however, breaks down where we can test it, and it is therefore dangerous where it must stand alone. The great genealogy of the official architects gives 21 generations from the contemporary of Setee I. (Dynasty XIX. 2), to the contemporary of Darius I. (XXVII. 3); and thus, allowing three generations to a century, we should bring the birth of Setee and the beginning of Dynasty XIX. to about b.c. 1200.^[37. Dr Brugsch escapes this difficulty by adding to the genealogy the reigns of Dynasty XVIII. (Hist., 2 ed. 26) as generations, and as these reigns had a shorter average length than generations, he recovers lost time.] l It is, however, quite certain that, reckoning from the synchronism of Sheshonk I., or Shishak, with Relιoboam, we must allow for the intervening period at least a century more. The historical events require this. We must therefore suppose that generations, either of heiresses or of other persons who did not hold the office of architect, are dropped. If this method of computing by genealogies thus fails where we have a genealogical list, obviously it cannot be applied to dynastic lists which we do not know to be genealogical. The average length of reigns is usually different from and less than that of generations, and we cannot tell the most probable average length of reigns without knowing’ the law of succession of the country, and its political conditions in the period under consideration. It is therefore especially hazardous thus to measure the Egyptian chronology before. Dynasty XVIII., at which time ascending genealogical evidence fails us. (See, however, Brugsch, Hist., 2 ed. 25-27.)

The preceding observations will prepare the reader to find in the following pages no definite chronological system for the period before the synchronism of Egyptian and Hebrew history at the beginning of Dynasty XXII. The essay would, however, be incomplete without a short account of the chronological views of the leading Egyptologists. Μ. Mariette accepts Manetho’s numbers with some modifications, and makes all the dynasties but one consecutive. He thus dates the beginning of Dynasty I. B.c. 5004. Dr Brugsch, following the genealogical method,proposed by Prof. Lieblein, and treating the reigns of the Tablet of Abydos as generations, but making an exception for the distracted age of the XIII.-XVII. Dynasties, when he adopts a series of years derived from Manetho, places the beginning of Egyptian history cir. B.C. 4400^[38. The apparent disagreement of this date and that given p. 27 as the result of the genealogical method is due to the higher date given in the table cited above to the beginning of Dynasty XVIII. on chronological data (for XVII. read XVIII. p. 180). The lower date of this epoch is due to the strictly genealogical method in the earlier statement, but it must be admitted that the difference is large.] {Hist., 2d ed. 179). Professor Lepsius adopts the 3555 years as the true duration of the thirty dynasties, and thus lowers the date in question to B.c. 3892. He reduces the length of the dynasties by making some in {tart or in whole contemporary.^[39. It must be remarked that he modifies the numbers of Manetho where they can be tested by monumental evidence, but in the great periodsfor which thatevidence fails he is forced to accept them as they have come down to us. This system is developed with much skill iu the Chronologie der Aegypter and Königsbuch der Aegypter.] Μ. Chabas proposes with much ιesitation the 40th century B.c. (Étudessur l' Antiquité Historique, 2 ed. 15, 16). The following table gives the date of the beginning of each dynasty according to Μ. Mariette and Professor Lepsius. The less definite schemes of Dr Brugsch and Μ. Chabas cannot be tabulated in the same manner.
[table]

There are two weak points in all these systems. They rest to a greater or less degree upon numbers either occurring but once or due to a single authority. The sum of 3555 years, which is the foundation of Professor Lepsius’s system, occurs in but a single passage, and the same is the case with the round number of 500 years adopted by Dr Brugsch for the doubtful period of Dynasties XIII.-XVII.; it is taken from Manetho’s 511 years of the Shepherd dominion. How if both these numbers are corrupt? If they are not their er ∙ape is a marvel, considering to what authors and copyists we owe them. Again, the sums of most individual dynasties rest on Manetho’s sole authority, and his lists are in a state which is at present hopeless. It is equally unfortunate that while certain dynasties are represented by monuments from which Manetho’s lists can be verified, others have left little or no records. Thus we have no monuments of Dynasties I.-III. until the close of the last. Then there is an abundance of monuments of Dynasties IV., V., VI. A blank follows without a monument that we can assign to Dynasties VII., VIII., IX., X. Records reappear under Dynasty XL; of Dynasty XII. they are abundant. Under Dynasty XIII. they become scanty, and of X1V., XV., XVI., XVII. there are but a few, which may be of XV., XVI., or XVII. We have therefore three blank periods, the age before known monuments, the interval of Dynasties VII.-X., and that of Dynasties XIII.-XVII. It is significant that whereas Μ. Mariette’s reckoning exceeds that of Professor Lepsius 1112 years in the whole sum of the thirty dynasties, the excess is no less than 966 years in the sums of Dynasties VIL-X. and XIII.-XVII. Such a difference between two such great authorities is a proof of the want of even probability for solving this part of the problem. Dr Brugsch, in applying the genealogical method to the lists of the monuments for the first and second blanks, while he rejects it for the third, is manifestly unwary. The evidence of the Turin Papyrus proves that we must not apply any such method to the third blank. How do we know that it can be applied to the other two? It may be argued that Manetho’s numbers for the reigns of the first blank are probable, but neither his lists nor the monuments throw any light on those of the second, to which, notwithstanding, Dr Brugsch allows no less a period than about 500 years. His system has also the special fault that it rests on the supposition that the Egyptian reigns are equivalent to generations, which, as already shewn, is by no means proved.

In the following sketch of Egyptian history no dates before the Christian Era will be given until the beginning of Dynasty XVIII., when approximative chronology becomes possible. Where, however, we may reasonably conjecture the length of a particular part cf history, this will be stated.

The traditional age in Egypt is extremely obscure. History begins with the First Dynasty. The earlier period with Manetho, who is supported by the Turin Papyrus, is mythological, the age of the divine reigns, an idea also traceable in the monuments which treat certain divinities as sovereigns. This age is held to be spoken of on the monuments as that of the Shesu-har, the servants, followers, or successors, of Horus, who, in mythology, aid him in his combats with Seth (Chabas, Ant. Hist., 7, 8; Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed. 23). Manetho completely divests the time of any historical character by making it cyclical. It might be supposed that the Egyptians had some idea of records actually dating from this age, if we could accept Μ. Chabas’s reading of the Ptolemaic inscription relating to the plan of the temple of Dendarah, in which it is stated that the original plan was found in the time of Peρi, of Dynasty VL, in ancient characters on a skin of ιhe time of the Shesu-har. It appears, however, from the context that this inscription was of the time oi Khufu, of Dynasty Iλ r ., and consequently the parallel expression is merely used to denote remote antiquity (Dümichen, Bauurkunde der Tempelanlagen von Dendera, 15, tαf. xvi.; 18, 19, taf. xv.; cf., on the other side, Chabas, Ant. Hist., 2d ed. 7, 8).

Egyptian mythology has not been found to contain any allusion to a deluge, nor to have any connection with the Mosaic narrative in reference to the cosmogony and the early conditions of the human race. Similar terms have been pointed out, but the leading facts are wanting. Thus the Egyptian ideas of their prehistoric age have a strange isolation by the side of those of most other nations of remote civilization, which agree in one or more particulars with the narrative of Genesis. Discoveries may, however, modify this view.
[9:7:731]

In Egypt stone implements have been recently discovered. Owing, however, to the abundance of historical monuments, the prehistorical remains have scarcely received due attention. We do not yet know whether these implements were used by the Egyptians or by savage tribes who may have made incursions into their territory. We find, however, the use of flint arrow-heads in the historical period from the paintings at Benee-Hasan (Dynasty XII.).

It is impossible to conjecture the duration of the prehistoric age in Egypt. M. Chabas has proposed a space of 4000 years before the First Dynasty as sufficient for the development of the civilization which had already attained maturity in the time of the Fourth Dynasty (Änc Hist., 9, 10). We are, however, so entirely ignorant of the causes of this civilization, and so unable to decide how far it was native to the soil of Egypt, that it is safer to abstain from any attempt to compute a period of the length of which the historical Egyptians themselves do not appear to have had any idea.

With Menes, in Egyptian Mena, the “stable,” the history of Egypt begins. It is true that Manetho states cautiously of his successors of the Second Dynasty certain things that are evidently legendary. This must be the natural result of a want of monumental evidence, and a consequent dependence on tradition. At present no monuments are known before the time of the last king of Dynasty III., and this may be the limit at which inscribed contemporary records began. It is, however, agreed by all Egyptologists that the founder of the Egyptian state is no legendary personage. All we know of him wears the air of history, and is consistent with the conditions in which a state would have been formed. Menes was of Thinis, in Upper Egypt, and consequently the first two dynasties are called Thinite. Thinis, or This, in Egyptian Teni, was perhaps only a quarter of the more famous Abydos. Certainly it was obscured by the near neighbourhood of the sacred city. Menes, having gained the sovereignty of Egypt, which probably before his time was divided into two states, founded the city of Memphis. In order to gain sufficient room for the site he changed the course of the Nile by constructing a dike, which turned the stream more to the east. M. Linant believes that this dyke is probably represented by that of Kusheysh. 'Γhe great temple of Ptah, at Memphis, was then founded; and there can be no doubt that the seat of government was, under Meπes, or not much later, removed to the new city. Menes made laws and waged a successful war. After a long reign of sixty-two years he was killed by a hippopotamus. All this has a perfectly historical aspect. Only a legislator and warrior, and so a mighty hunter, could have set upon a stable basis the long-lasting fabric of Egyptian polity. The main qualities of the man who did this could not have been forgotten at Memphis, which was great and flourishing, the chief seat of Egyptian learning and wealth, before the close of the Third Dynasty. The reproach that Menes corrupted the primitive simplicity of the Egyptians is probably a perverted tradition, like that which changed the tyranny of Khufu and Khafra to impiety. In later times Menes was reverenced with other kings, but as far as we know had no special worship, a condition suitable to his historical character, now universally admitted.

Athothis, either Tota or Atot, the first or second successor of Menes, is related to have founded the palace at Memphis, and, being a physician, to have written anatomical books. A medical papyrus in the Museum of Berlin, composed under Ramses II. (Dynasty XIX.), curiously illustrates the second statement. It contains a portion said to have been copied from a very ancient papyrus discovered in the time of Hesp-ti, or Usaphaidos, a later king of the First Dynasty, and to have been subsequently taken to Senta, or Sethenes, of the next line (Brugsch, Hist., 2 ed., 42). Under Uenephes, the fourth Thinite king, a great famine, the first recorded, ravaged Egypt, He is also said to have raised the pyramids near Kochome. As Kakem is the monumental name of the part of the Memphite necropolis around the Serapeum, and north of the Pyramid of Steps of Sakkarah, Dr Brugsch and others are disposed to consider that pyramid, which is a very archaic structure among pyramids, to be here intended. The use of the plural “pyramids” by Manetho does not stand in the way of the identification, as we know a case in which a small pyramid was built at the same time as a large one. We do not know the original purpose of the monument. Under the early dynasties it was used as the burial-place of the bulls Apis. As, however, their worship was introduced under Dynasty IL, it may have been at first a royal sepulchre, like all other pyramids of which we know the use. Under Semempses, the seventh king of the dynasty, Manetho speaks of many wonders and a very great plague. Thus the two chief scourges of Egypt appear in this remote age, suggesting a large population, and consequently the length of the period preceding the accession of Menes.

With Boethos, or Butau, the Second Dynasty begins. Manetho relates that in his time a great chasm opened at Bubastis and many perished. Frequent as volcanic shocks are in Egypt, it is long since an earthquake has been experienced in that country. There are, however, reasons, from the manner in which monuments have fallen and the records of earthquakes in Palestine in antiquity, for supposing that Egypt was anciently more subject to such calamities than in later times. The next king, Kaiechos, Kakau, introduced the worship of the bulls Apis at Memphis, and Mnevis at Heliopolis, and of the Mendesian goat, and his name appears to commemorate these innovations, probably a necessary step owing to the increase of population, for animals locally worshipped were thus restricted in number. We also notice that already Heliopolis and Mendes, besides Thinis, Memphis, and Bubastis had been founded. Under the next king, whose name, Binothris, Bainnuter, was probably commemorative of the new worship at Mendes, we read that a law was passed that women could hold the sovereign power. This might in a semi-barbarous condition be a relic of polyandry, but in Egypt the civilization of Dynasty IV. forbids such an explanation, and we must rather regard this new law as a proof of advancement. In consequence we find a few reigns of queens in the Egyptian lists, but only one of them, Sebek-neferu-ra (Dynasty XII.), appears in those of the monuments. Succession through an heiress was, however, carefully respected, and it was perhape for want of a son that Binothris made this edict. It may be chance, but Manetho calls each king of Dynasty I. after Menes, son oi his predecessor, whereas under Dynasty II. he drops this characterization. Nothing more is told of this line but two marvels, that under Manetho’s seventh king, Nephercheres, the Nile was fabled to have flowed mixed with honey for eleven days, and that the eighth, Sesochris, was said to have had a height of 5 cubits and 3 palms, which is not improbably a confused account of a colossal statue.

The royal house now changed by the accession of Dynasty III., the first of Memphites. Manetho relates how, under its head, Necherophes or Necherochis, the Nebka of the monumental lists, the Libyans revolted from the Egyptians but returned to their allegiance terrified by a sudden increase of the moon. It is useless to speculate on the character of the phenomenon which, unless it be legendary, was probably an eclipse; but the glimpse we thus obtain of an Egyptian dominion beyond the Nile valley at this remote age iβ most valuable. In Genesis the Lehabim, or Lubim, appear as a race kindred to the Egyptians. In the [9:7:732] Egyptian inscriptions they are called Rebu, or Lebu, and appear on early monuments as a dark people. Under the Empire they have Caucasian characteristics. The change was probably due to the great maritime migrations of the Pelasgic tribes, in which the Libyans had an important share. To the next king, Tosorthros, Manetho assigns the invention of building with hewn stones and cultivation of letters, and says that for his medical knowledge the Egyptians called him Aesculapius. If the Pyramid of Steps dates from an earlier king, the first statement must be qualified, though it is to be remarked that the difference of constructive skill between that monument, if so early, and the works of Dynasty IV., would almost justify the historian; and again the discovery of inscriptions of a less accurately ordered kind than those of Dynasty IV. may support the second statement; the third seems at variance with the Memphite worship of the Egyptian Aesculapius, Imhwep. On the monuments contemporary history begins with the last king the lists assign to this dynasty, Senoferu, probably Manetho’s last but one, Sephuris. We may now take a retrospect of the age. It is in some respects curiously primitive in comparison with that which immediately follows it. Dr Brugsch has remarked the general absence in the kings’ names of the name of Ra, afterwards essential to thronenames, which from the medallic character of some of these they seem to have been, and the equally general absence of the names of other gods, Ra occurring once in the three dynasties and Sekeri once. Again he has observed the somewhat plebeian aspect of these names, as proper to men who sternly ruled the masses. Mena is “the stable,” he who resists; Tota, “he who strikes;” Senta, “the terrible;” Huni,“he who strikes.” Senoferu is “the betterer.” As “the striker of the peoples,” for so he is called in his inscription at Wadee Maghârah, in the Sinaitic peninsula, he is a foreign conqueror.^[40. The chronological length of this first unknown period in the thirty dynasties cannot be determined. In the Turin Papyrus three durations of reigτls are preserved. They are each less than Manetho’s numbers of the same reigns, however we fit the two lists together. It is further remarkable that while the length of Dynasty I. gives nearly a generation of 33∣ years to each reign (253÷8 = 3Γ6) that of Dynasty II. gives almost exactly this average (302, Afr.÷9 = 33'5; 297, Eus.÷9-33.)]

From Senoferu, at the close of Dynasty III., to the end of Dynasty VI., we have a succession of contemporary monuments by which history can be reconstructed, not only in its political events, but in those details of the condition of the population which make an essential part of all real history. Under Senoferu we find great material prosperity, and the arts already in that condition of excellence which makes the Pyramid age in some respects the most remarkable in the annals of Egypt. We also find foreign conquest, not as in the time of the Empire for glory, but with the view of extending the Egyptian rule to countries whose products were valuable for the arts. It is thus that this Pharaoh is the earliest who has left a tablet in the Sinaitic peninsula, where perhaps he, as Dr Brugsch thinks, was the first to plant military colonies to protect the workers in the mines of copper and the valuable blue stone called “mafkat,” and this idea is supported by his being afterwards worshipped there. He is also the first king whose pyramid is found with its special name on the monuments. Dr Brugsch thinks it is that now called the Pyramid of Meydoom, near which chapels of tombs bearing his name have been discovered, and a group consisting of two statues, remarkable as a splendid specimen of Egyptian archaic art. The subjects, it may be remarked, were usually buried near the pyramid of the reigning king. Senoferu the betterer left a good name as a beneficent king, and his worship was maintained until the Ptolemaic period.

Khufu, the Suphis I. of Manetho and Cheops of Hero dotus, immediately succeeds Senoferu in the lists of the monuments, so that he may be regarded as the legitimate head of Dynasty IV. The list of that dynasty is as follows :—Khufu, Ratatf, Khafra, Menkaura, Shepseskaf, corresponding to eight kings in Manetho, in whom also the order is different, Ratatf (Ratoises) following Menkaura (Mencheres), a natural consequence of the association in fame of the builders of the three most celebrated pyramids, Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura.^[41. The numbers of Manetho are irreconcilable with those of the Turin Papyrus assigned by scholars to this period. There is evidence that they cannot be considered to be consecutive in the inscription which mentions a lady, a Queen Mertitefs, as a great favourite of Senoferu and Khufu and attached to Khafra. M. de Rouge remarks that she must have been very old at the time of Khafra (Six Prem. Bryn., 256 seqq. ), but in the list of Manetho the intervening reigns (Ratoises 25, Suphis [IL] 66) amount to 91 years. If we allow her to have been 14 years old at the end of the reign of Senoferu and to have lived a year into that of Khafra, her age would not be less than 106 years. This is very near the extreme limit of human life in the Egyptian inscriptions, 110 years, and it is based on the minimum of time possible in the case. The length of early kings’ lives in the Turin Papyrus supports this view. Probably the reigns overlapped one another. This idea is supported by the two chief chambers in the Great Pyramid, which has already made Μ. de Rongé suspect that it was the tomb of two kings (Id. 261, note 1). A sound argument for the chronology of the time miglιt be found in the size of the three chief pyramids. A pyramid was the great work of a king’s reign, and it was so constructed that it might be continually increased in size and yet easily completed at any time. The Great Pyramid would indicate a reign of maximum duration; so, too, the Second; whereas the Third would, in its original size, mark a shorter time. By this method we should be induced to accept Manetho’s numbers for Khufu, 63 years, and Khafra, 66, but to doubt the long reign of Menkaura, 63. It would be reasonable on the other evidence to make Ratatf contemporary with Khufu or Khafra.]

The age of the pyramid-builders is the most brilliant before the Empire. We can judge from the royal tombs of the magnificence of the kings, and from the sepulchres around of the wealth of the subjects. The construction of the pyramids has perhaps been unduly marvelled at: we should know in what other manner the kings employed the vast amount of manual labour at their disposal, if we would estimate how much they could have effected by it in pyramid-building in the long period of time for which they ruled. If the two reigns of Khufu and Khafra extended over more than a century and a quarter, we may measure what we know them to have done against the works of other states during a like interval, and the comparison reduces our wonder.

The regal power at this time seems to have been very strong. So at least may we infer from the phraseology of the inscriptions, and from the fact that the kings threw much, if not all, of the force of the nation into personal monuments for their own memorial. Never in later times is the royal tomb the chief object of the king’s reign, or is he so completely detached from the welfare of Egypt. The pyramids with their priesthoods are proofs that then the Pharaoh was more positively worshipped than ever afterwards.

It must, how ever, be admitted that the great men whose tombs are planned around the pyramids enjoyed abundant wealth and ease. Their time was passed not in war or in state affairs, but in the management of large estates, probably royal gifts, and in superintending the handicrafts of their people, and giving no small share of their leisure to the pleasures of the chase, to hospitality, and to the enjoyment of musical performances. In the chapels of their tombs these occupations of everyday life are portrayed. There is no sign of war, no great military class. It is true that the common folk seem to have been very poor, but their life in that land of abundance is at least represented as happy. On the other hand, it is significant that the nobility include a large number of the royal family, and that the king is [9:7:733] not represented in the tombs, and when he is spoken of it is in terms of the most distant respect. Similarly there is an extraordinary reserve as to worship. Religious subjects are wanting, and the religious inscriptions are usually limited to the formula of dedication. The priesthood is already numerous, but it is connected with the service of the chapels of the pyramids. In the vast court a baneful bureaucratic class is already growing, in future to destroy the welfare of the people.

The reign of Khufu is principally marked by the building of the Great Pyramid. We learn from a curious inscription of a later date that he rebuilt the temple of Isis, near the Sphinx, carved out of the rock by some earlier king, and that he made a pyramid for the Princess Hent-sen in the same neighbourhood. The charge of impiety which the local tradition reported by Herodotus brings against Khufu thus fails, and the charge of tyranny associated with it, may be equally groundless. The cost of life in building the Great Pyramid can scarcely be compared with that of a long war under conditions resembling those of modern China. It should be noted that Khufu, as well as Khafra and Ratatf, were still objects of worship under Dynasty XXVI. (Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed. 57, 58). The only record of foreign conquest is a tablet in the peninsula of Sinai, commemorating what was probably no more than a successful maintenance of the posts already there established to guard the mines.

The reign of Khafra is commemorated, like that of Khufu, by the royal sepulchre and the tombs of subjects. From the latter we are able to contradict the tradition of his hostility to the national religion, in which Herodotus associates him with Khufu. The most interesting remains of the time are the statues of this king found in a well near the Sphinx, into which they were probably thrown either by a foreign invader or by early Christians or by Arabs, rather than in a popular revolt after his death (cf., however, Maspero, Histoire Ancienne, 73). A statue and a bust of Khafra from this find have been published by M. de Rouge (Six Prem. Dyn., pl. iv. v.). Both are remarkable works, showing a naturalistic style that makes them far superior to later statues. The king’s head is evidently a portrait, and the type is more Caucasian than the generality of later subjects.

Menkaura, or Mencheres, the Mycerinus of Herodotus, and the founder of the Third Pyramid, does not seem to have been specially reverenced in later times, in contradiction to the report of Herodotus. It is, however, interesting, in connection with the tradition of his support of religion, that the Egyptian Ritual speaks of its 64th chapter as found by Har-tot-ef, son of Mencheres, at Hermopolis Magna, when he made an inspection of the temples of Egypt, and brought as a precious document to the king (Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed. p. 59, 60). It would thus appear that the Ritual was not then completed, and Manetho’s statement that Suphis I., Khufu, wrote the sacred book may be another hint as to its date. It may also be noticed that the queen of Khafra was priestess of Thoth (Six Prem. Tlyn., 277 seqqj), and a noble, probably son of Khafra, was high-priest of Thoth at Hermopolis, a dignity held by another prince in the same reign (Id. 280, 281).

The most interesting record of Menkaura is his wooden mummy-case, found by General Howard Vyse in the Third Pyramid. In the disappointing silence of those vast monuments, without a single ancient Egyptian writing save the graffiti of workmen and the inscriptions of native visitors, this solitary record of the time is the one authoritative voice from the royal sepulchres, and it tells us in its short archaic formula that the whole myth of Osiris in its relations to human destiny was already matured. The king as Osiris has become divine and has vanquished his enemies (Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed., 58, 59).

The next family, Dynasty V., continued to rule at Memphis.^[42. This Dynasty appears to have consisted of nine kings, who probably reigned nearly 200 years (Brugsch, Hist., 1 ed., 288).] Of its sovereigns we know but little. The last but one, Assa, is the first Pharaoh whom we know to have had two names, the throne-name as well as the ordinary one. To his son Ptah-hotep is assigned the ancient moral treatise already noticed in speaking of Egyptian literature, which is on the whole the best fruit of Egyptian thought that time has spared. The last king, Unas, varied the form of royal tombs, by constructing the great truncated pyramid now called Mastabat-Faraoon, or Pharaoh’s Seat, north of the Pyramids of Dahshoor. (Id. 67.)

The Sixth Dynasty was probably a family of a different part of Egypt.^[43. Manetho assigns to Dynasty VI. a duration of 203 years. The monumental lists, themselves in disaccord, the Turin Papyrus, and the contemporary inscription of Una, show that Manetho’s list is here hopelessly corrupted. Una was in office under the immediate or second predecessor as well as under the immediate successor of Pepi, usually identified with Plιiops, to whom the Egyptian historian assigns a reign of 100 or possibly 94 years. Μ. de Rongé has seen this difficulty, and discussed without finally resolving it (Six Ρτern. Dyn., 361 scqq.). Μ. Maspero has proposed a most ingenious restoration of the dynasty, on the idea that Neferkara is the long-lived Phiops, and that his familyname must therefore have been Pepi (Hist. Anc., 96). This conjecture seems to us to be confirmed by the name of the later Neferkara Pepi of the Tablet of Abydos being qualified by the title “seneb," as if to distinguish him from an earlier king of otherwise identical name] It has left many records which indicate less centralization at Memphis than those of the earlier sovereigns, and mark the beginning of wars for predatory purposes and extension of territory. This change is accompanied by a less careful style of sculpture, and less pains in the excavation of the tombs, as though the Egyptians were gaining a larger horizon, or, it may be, exchanging religion for ambition. The interest of the dynasty centres in the undoubtedly long reign of Pepi, second or third king of the line, and the inscription of Una. In this inscription we first read of great wars, and foreign conquered nations are spoken of by name. A military system had already begun, for we read how the king sent with Una an officer and soldiers to transport a sarcophagus for the royal tomb from the quarries of Turk. A war is then undertaken against the nomads of the eastern desert— the Amu (Shemites ΐ) and the Herusha, “those who are on the sand.” An army is levied from the whole population of Upper and Lower Egypt, as though there were no military caste. Negroes are also enrolled from several countries mentioned byname, which must have been subject to Egypt, and are drilled by Egyptian officers, including priests. Una is appointed general in chief. Five separate expeditions are conducted by him into the country of the Herusha. It seems an error to suppose that this nation were Arabs of the desert, for the Egyptian general cut down their vines and their fig-trees (I) Another expedition was conducted by water against the same nation in a country called Takheba? (De Rougé) or Terehba '? (Brugsch), which M. de Rougé conjectures may be Arabia Petraea, or a part of Syria, remarking that it was near Egypt, for the expeditions seem to have been annual. The external activity of the reign of Pepi is also attested by a tablet at Wâdee Ma-gharali, and his public works by many inscriptions, among which we must not omit the occurrence of his name at Tanis, and in the inscription relating to the building of the temple of Dendarah. He founded a city called the “City of Pepi” in Middle Egypt, which has wholly disappeared, and tombs of his time are found in various parts of the Nile valley. His pyramid, which, like Memphis, was called the “good station,” Men-nofer, was probably at the ancient capital, and may be one of the two great pyramids of Dahshoor, which [9:7:734] are of later date than Dynasty 1V., if we may judge from their structure, and both of which from their size imply reigns of the greatest prosperity and of long duration.

Pepi was succeeded by his son Merenra. The new king made Una governor of Upper Egypt, and employed him to bring blocks of granite from Elephantine for his pyramid, and in various other works of which the inscription already referred to gives most curious details. He was charged to obtain wood, which was provided by the prince of four Ethiopian nations already mentioned among those furnishing negroes to the great army of Pepi. We thus learn that tributary Ethiopia was ruled by a native prince or princes under the governor of Upper Egypt, who also had the power of establishing posts in the dependency. Una made four docks and timber-yards in Ethiopia for building boats, and attached a chapel to each. We may thus expect to find some record of Egyptian rule at this early time, long before the complete reduction of Lower Nubia, in territories far south; for the timber-growing country does not begin for some distance within the tropics.

Merenra was followed by his younger brother Neferkara, and, according to Manetho, the dynasty ended with the beautiful Queen Nitocris, whose name appears in the Turin Papyrus, but whose exact historical place is not certain. If she was buried in the Third Pyramid, of which Manetho, according to the copyists, makes her the builder, she enlarged the original work of Mencheres, and certainly no pyramid is so evidently not merely a double structure but one of double design. Nitocris is almost the only Egyptian whose historical character has been lost in a succession of legends. One version of her story is the most ancient form of that of Cinderella; in another, she still bewitched the Arab of the Middle Ages when he approached her pyramid {cf. Maspero, Hist. Anc., 94).

With the later part of Dynasty VI. the second great chasm in Egyptian history begins, and we have no monuments to guide us until the time of Dynasty XI. According to Manetho, Dynasties VII. and VIII. were of Memphites, and IX. and X. of Heracleopolites, the Diospolite or Theban line comprising Dynasties XL, XII., and XIII. Whether the dynasties which intervened between the VIth and XIIth were contemporary or successive, and how much time they occupied, cannot yet be proved. In the Tablet of Abydos, a series of kings unknown from other monuments follows Dynasty VI., and precedes two kings of Dynasty XI. In the Chamber of Kings of El-Karnak other and earlier kings of Dynasty XI. are named, with curious indications that it was first but a local line. To the period of the earlier kings of Dynasty XI. belongs Entef-aa, who reigned at least fifty years. It would appear that the Memphite kingdom waned, and that another line arose at Thebes, the house of the Entefs and Mentuhoteps. The power of these kings gradually increased, and at last one of them reunited under a single rule the whole of Egypt. (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 98, 99.) Probably the Heracleopolite line, Dynasties IX., X., was a local house contemporary with the Memphites or Thebans, or both.

With Dynasty XII.^[44. The length of Dynasty XII. appears to have been 213 years 1 rn. 24 d. (Lepsius, Veber die Zwölfte Λegyptische Königsdynastie, Akad. Berl. 1853.)] the Theban line was firmly established over all Egypt. In the circumstances referred to in the “Instructions” of Amenemhat I., its first king, to his son Usurtesen I., we have a glimpse into the unquiet condition of the country when the line arose {Id., 101). Similarly the custom of associating the heir apparent as king with his father, the peculiarity of this dynasty, indicates the dangers that then surrounded the throne {of. Id. 105).

It is to the grottoes of Benee-Hasan that we owe most of our knowledge of the manners and arts of Egypt under Dynasty XII., and much of its history is there told in the memoirs of a family of governors under the first five kings of this house. No one can have examined these beautiful tombs without being struck by the advance in architecture which they show, and the evidence of prosperity and cultivation afforded by their paintings. The subjects resemble those of the tombs of the earlier dynasties, but there is a greater variety, partly due to a more luxurious condition of society, partly to a more flexible art. It is sufficiently evident that the preceding dynasty (XI.) cannot have been weak, and the country under its rule distracted. A time of prosperity must have preceded this bright period of Egyptian history.

Amenemhat I., probably a successful minister of an earlier king (Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed., 79, 80, 84), had an active and prosperous reign, ruling like Pepi beyond Egypt to the south, and occupying himself in the construction of various monuments. As the head of a new line he paid special attention to the boundaries of territories, to the regulation of the inundation, and to the confirmation of hereditary governors (Benee-Hasan inscr.; Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed., 94, 95). A very curious view of the state of Egypt in his time is given us by the story of Saneha in a hieratic papyrus of the Berlin Museum (translated by M. Goodwin, in Records of the Past, vi. 131, seqq. ∖ It is the history of an Egyptian who fled from the king and took refuge with a neighbouring prince, whose territory unhappily we cannot as yet determine, and after a long sojourn sought his sovereign’s pardon and returned home to be taken into the favour of Amenemhat. The reception of the fugitive abroad, his home-sickness, and the kindness of the Pharaoh, who at the same time is described in terms of the most abject respect, form an interesting picture, and one remarkably illustrating several events in the history of Egypt.

Under Usurtesen I., the co-regent and successor of Amenemhat I., Egypt had reached its highest prosperity after the age of the pyramid-builders of Dynasty IV. The obelisk which still marks the site of Heliopolis, a fragment of a statue at Tanis, inscriptions on the rocks of the Sinaitic peninsula, and a stele from Wâdee Halfeh, recording foreign conquests in the south, now in the Naples Museum, attest the splendour of this reign. The records of private individuals are, however, its most instructive memorials. Mentuhotep has given us a picture of the power and status of an Egyptian prime minister, holding all or nearly all the functions of the members of a modern cabinet, a position singularly parallel to that of Joseph, to the detail that even great men bowed before him. To his stele we owe the in - formation that he gained successes against the Asiatics, the Herusha, and the negroes. (Brugsch, Hist., 2d ed., 91, seqq.)

Of Amenemhat II. and Usurtesen IL, the next kings, there is little to relate but that Egypt continued to prosper. It was under Usurtesen III. that a great step in advance was made by the fixing of the boundaries of the Egyptian dominion beyond the Second Cataract, at Semneh and Kummeh, where this king built sanctuaries and fortresses, and placed great boundary-marks in the form of tablets. These in their inscriptions define the limits of the kingdom, and regulate the passage of negroes by the river {Id., 102). Here and throughout Nubia, Usurtesen was worshipped in subsequent times. He had introduced a settled government into the country, which long after was virtually a part of Egypt rather than a dependency. His successor Amenemhat III. is chiefly famous for his great engineering works. That care which the first Amenemhat bestowed on the regulation of the inundation seems to have been the great object of his reign. The rocks of Semneh and Knmmeh bear registers of the height of the Nile in several [9:7:735] years of his reign. His great enterprise, the most successful of its kind ever carried out in Egypt, was the construction of a vast artificial reservoir, Lake Mceris, in the province now called the Feiyoom, which received the waters of the Nile by a canal, and after the inundation spread them over the country. Its fisheries were also very valuable. Through the neglect of ages the site of Lake Moeris was forgotten until, in our time, M. Linant traced it. Near the lake, Amenemhat III. built the famous Labyrinth, of which the remains were discovered by Dr Lepsius during the Prussian Expedition to Egypt, and there raised a pyramid. The use of the Labyrinth is unknown; the pyramid was no doubt the royal tomb. Its moderate dimensions and the vast size of the lake show a remarkable contrast to the earlier great pyramids, with apparently no corresponding work of public usefulness. At the time which produced the Lake Moeris civilization had reached a point far above that of the age of Khufu, perhaps the highest Egypt has ever known. Of the short reigns of Amenemhat IV. and Queen Sebek-nefru-ra we know nothing, but that with the latter the dynasty came to a close.

With the accession of Dynasty XIII. we reach the third chasm in the Egyptian monumental records. This line, Theban like its predecessor, but with a special favour for Middle Egypt (c∕. Brugsch, Hist., 2<j ed. 115), seems to have ruled all Egypt. Its power, however, was evidently weakened, either by external war or by internal dissension. Many monuments may have been lost or may yet lie hid in the mounds of towns of Middle Egypt, but the scantiness of records of public works is a proof of its weakness. Where are its tablets in the quarries 1 In the Turin Papyrus are preserved the lengths of several of the reigns of its kings, who generally bore the names Sebek-hotep or Nefer-hotep. The longest reign is 13 years, and but one other reaches 10, the total of 13 reigns being but 48 years 22 days, and 6 sums of months and 7 of days effaced. Putting the total at 50 years, the allowance for each reign is under 4 years. This must have been a time of disturbance, but not necessarily of disastrous wars ; for if we compare the rule of the second line of Memlook sultans we obtain an average reign of 5 years each. This we know to have been the consequence of domestic disturbance, and not of great public disasters at home or abroad. Dynasty XIV., of Xoïtes, the next in Manetho’s list, is the first which had certainly its capital in the Delta. Beyond this fact we can only conjecture its importance and chronological place.

The invasion and conquest, at least in part, of Egypt by the Hyksos, or Shepherd Kings, is undoubtedly the chief cause of the obscurity of this age. The event did not happen until at least some time after the beginning of Dynasty XIII., for the eighteenth king of that line in the Turin Papyrus, who bears the significant name Mer-mesha, “the general,” has left a record at Tanis near the eastern frontier, which was probably the chief city of at least one dynasty of the invaders.

Manetho, as cited by Josephus, allows for the stay of the foreigners in Egypt a period of 511 years, which has been supposed to be about the interval beween Dynasty XII. and Dynasty XVIII., by which they were expelled. This number, however, rests upon the single evidence of J osephus, and is moreover probably made up of sums of dynasties, which would render its evidence doubtful. A better means of measuring the period would be afforded by the monumental evideuce that a Shepherd king ruled 400 years before Ramses II. could we place this foreign sovereign. All that can be said as to the chronology is that Dynasty XV. and XVI. were probably of Shepherds, and Dynasty XVII. was certainly Theban. Judging from the numbering, it is probable that there was a break in rhe Theban succession, and that the two Shepherd dynasties were successive, the Xoïtes perhaps being but a provincial line.^[45. The Tablet of 400 Years states that this period elapsed from some point in the reign of the Shepherd king Set-aa-pehti Nub to some point in that of Ramses II., and again Apepee, whose name corresponds to the Apophis of Manetho, almost immediately preceded Dynasty XVIII. Apophis is mentioned among the only Shepherd kings Manetho names. In the passage preserved by Josephus these are called the first Shepherd rulers, who very properly compose the first Shepherd dynasty, the XVth, in the epitome of Africanus; though Eusebius transfers them to Dynasty XVII., perhaps knowing they immediately preceded Dynasty XVIII. In Africanus, Dynasty XVI. is of Shepherds and XVII. of Shepherds and Thebans. If the identification of Apepee with the Apophis of Dynasty XV. were certain we might have a rough measure of the time of the Shepherd rule, but this is not proved.]

The story of the Hyksos is thus told by Manetho. Under a king called Timaios, or Timaos (not recognized in the list or on the monuments), certain invaders from the East conquered Egypt without a battle, destroying the temples and slaying or enslaving the people. At length they made one of themselves, Salatis by name, king, who ruled at Memphis, and made all Egypt tributary. For the better protection of the eastern border he rebuilt and fortified the city Avaris, in the Sethroite nome in Lower Egypt, where he kept a great force of soldiers. He was succeeded by other kings mentioned by name, who, and their descendants, held Egypt for 511 years. After this the kings of the Thebais and of the rest of Egypt rose against the Shepherd rule, and a great and long war was waged, until Misphragmuthosis drove the Shepherds out of all Egypt except Avaris, where his son Tuthmosis besieged them, and failing to take the place agreed to a capitulation, on the condition that they should be allowed to leave the country. Accordingly they went through the desert to Judaea and founded Jerusalem. They were called Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, and, according to some, they were Arabs.

This narrative, notwithstanding a general confirmation from the monuments, is evidently not wholly correct. In particular it is inconsistent with all other evidence in attributing the foundation of Jerusalem to the Shepherds, which is evidently the result of an endeavour to connect their departure with the Exodus. Manetho seems to have preserved two Egyptian theories of the Exodus, which both explained that event as the retreat of eastern invaders. M. Mariette’s researches in the ruins of Tanis have brought to light monuments of the Shepherds, and led to the discovery of others elsewhere, while M. de Bougé and other scholars have explained Egyptian documents connected with the war of independence. From these different sources we learn that the foreigners were of the Shemite or a kindred type, resembling the modern inhabitants of the north-east of Lower Egypt, who still retains the peculiarities already noticed by Greek writers. Though their conquest may have been marked by violence, we find them in their own monuments using and cultivating the manners and civilization of Egypt, and even giving a new and characteristic development to its art in their costly monoliths of granite, which show from their material that their rule extended to the southern boundary of Egypt. The war of independence arose between Apepee, one of their later kings, who is described as worshipping Seth only, and one of the three Theban kings called on the monuments Ra-skenen Taa, at this time apparently a tributary prince. The war, contrary to Manetho’s statement, does not seem to have been of long continuance, having been brought to a successful end by Aahmes, first king of Dynasty XVIII., between whom and Ra-skenen Taa no great length of time can have elapsed. Manetho’s text is again erroneous in making the conqueror Tuthmosis (Thothmes IV.), son (grandson) of Misphragmuthosis (Thothmes III.), sixth [9:7:736] and fifth sovereigns of Dynasty XVIII. in his list; but this may be a confusion due to copyists, as there is other evidence that he placed the conquest of the Shepherds under Amosis, or Aahmes. The expulsion of the foreigners was not so complete as Manetho would have us imagine. Several names in their territory remained Shemite, or the population non-Egyptian, and under Dynasty XIX. the prejudice that appears in Dynasty XVIII. seems almost removed.

It must be here noticed that Dr Brugsch has copied a remarkable inscription, from the tomb at Eile thyia of Baba, whom he assigns to the latter part of Dynasty XVII., in which mention is made of a famine of successive years. “A famine having broken out during many years, I gave corn to the town during each famine.” There are but two known instances in history of a famine in Egypt lasting several years, the seven years’ famine of Joseph and the seven years’ famine of the Fâtimee caliph El-Mustansir. Dr Brugsch has, therefore, argued with high probability that Baba records the famine of Joseph, and that the old tradition that Joseph governed Egypt under the Shepherd King Apophis is a true one (c∕. supra, p. 735, note 1). To this we shall recur in speaking of the Exodus. (See Brugsch, Hist., 2 ed. 174, seqqj)

The beginning of Dynasty XVIII. (b.c. 1600-1500?) is marked by two great events, the union of divided Egypt under one head, and the victorious end of the great war with the Shepherds.^[46. The chronology of Dynasty XVIII. is not yet fixed. Manetho’s list is here in a very corrupt state. Certain numbers can be corrected or confirmed by the monuments, and if we provisionally accept the others, we obtain a sum of not greatly over two hundred years for the line, supposing it to end with the accession of Ramses I. It must, however, be remembered that those numbers which are provisionally accepted are manifestly unsafe. The sum may be more nearly determined when we know the place of the Shepherd-king Nub, whose reign was 400 years before that of Ramses II.] Aahmes, probably a Theban prince, appears to have secured the supreme rule over the various princes of Egypt, without abolishing their rights, and to have gained Ethiopian support by his marriage with Nefru-ari, daughter of a king of Ethiopia. He then directed his whole power to the final liberation of Egypt. The tomb at Eilethyia of Aahmes son of Abuna, an officer of the Egyptian flotillas, in an inscription relating his services, throws light on the events of th⅛ war. He passed his early youth in the fortress of Eilethyia, one of the strong positions where the kings of Dynasty XVII. rallied their subjects. In the reign of Aahmes he was made officer of the ship called the “Calf.” Later he went to the flotilla of the north to fight. It was during the siege of the fortress of Avaris. He served in the vessel “Ruling in Memphis,” a name no doubt given to commemorate the addition of the ancient capital to the dominions of Aahmes. An engagement took place on the water near Avaris. Subsequently Avaris was taken, and the young officer carried off three captives, whom the king granted him as slaves. This was in the. fifth year of Aahmes; in the next we read of the conquest of Sharuhan, the Sharuhen of the book of Joshua, in the south-west of Palestine. The memoir then adds that, after having slain the Shepherds of Asia, the king undertook a successful expedition against an Ethiopian country. (See Brugsch, Hist., 1 ed. 80, 81.)

This narrative, while generally confirming Manetho’s story, corrects it in some particulars. It states that Avaris was taken, not that it capitulated, and indicates a pursuit of the enemy within the territory of Palestine, where they were again conquered in a city which they attempted to hold. The Ethiopian expedition was a reassertion of the Egyptian domiuion to the south. Two tablets in the Turk quarries record how, in the twenty-second year of his reign, Aahmes restored the temples which had fallen into decay, the blocks being removed by bulls under the charge of Phoenicians? (Fenkhu) (Brugsch, Hist., 2 ed. 173, 174). It may be recollected that the Phoenicians appear as skilled smiths and masons in the time of Solomon, and that as early as the Exodus they were already great metalworkers.

From the time of Aahmes till the close of Dynasty XX. we may reckon the rise, fulness, and decay of the Egyptian Empire. It is a period of abundant monuments, sculptured and painted, and of many papyri, rich in records of the history, manners, and religion of Egypt. The state of the country may be glanced at in this place, where the Shepherd period closes, so as not to break the continuity of the subsequent history.

The sudden growth of prosperity at home and power abroad which marks the early reigns of Dynasty XV1II. is truly surprising. The Egypt of Dynasty XVII. is broken up and only slowly reuniting; that of Dynasty XVIII. is at once solidly bound together, and soon to engage in designs of world-dominion never hinted at in earlier times. These conditions were the result of a great national war, in which the country discovered her hidden force, and was not content to use it only so far as was needful to make a strong Egypt like that of Dynasty XII. Having conquered her foreign rulers at home, she desired to add their native lands to her own dominions. The first effects of these designs were the enrichment of Egypt. In the early reigns of this house the wealth of the subjects as of the king rapidly grew. From the simple monuments of Dynasty XVII. and the first kings of Dynasty XVI IT. there is a sudden advance to richness and splendour. Egypt was, however, becoming a military state. The king is constantly more powerful, and his public works more magnificent; the subjects, notwithstanding the luxury of individuals, have not that solid princely strength that we admire in those of the Pyramid kings and Dynasty XII. The appearance of the horse under this dynasty is most significant. The beasts of burden, the ox and ass, now yield in importance to the war-horse, and the landed proprietor journeys in his car whose ancestor went afoot staff in hand. Thus the military man succeeds the farmer. The priest is no longer a great man who has assumed sacerdotal functions, but one of a class immensely extended, reaching from the highest dignitaries, one of whom, strengthened by hereditary power, could at last seize the throne, down to the menial class who lived upon the superstitions of the people. To carry on the government there grew side by side with soldiers and priests a vast official body, clever, ambitious, and unscrupulous, which rapidly on the true bureaucratic principle in- volved the administration in an entanglement which must have mainly led to the decline of the Empire. Justice, which was difficult at home, must have been almost impossible abroad. We now cease to hear of hereditary nomarchs studying the welfare of provinces to which they were attached by ancestral connection. All posts went by the royal favour. The common people fared ill in this age. Their function was to supply soldiers for the army and navy, and at first to take their share in the construction of public works; their only hope was to rise in the official class. Handicrafts and all labour were beneath a gentleman; hence no one could rise to his grade but through success at the schools, which were open to every one, and where a boy of talent had his chance of a career (cf. Brugsch., Hist., 1 ed. 16, 17).

Of the administration of provinces and conquered states we know little. Lower Ethiopia had always been ruled as a part of Egypt; this system was extended southward. At first the eastern states only paid tribute. Ultimately garrisons were placed in Palestine and Phoenicia (Brugsch, Hist., 1 ed. 135). Compared with the Assyrians the [9:7:737] Egyptians were civilized conquerors, and the sculptures of their battles do not represent any scenes of extreme cruelty. They do not, however, seem to have known the art of effectually holding their acquisitions, which had to be reconquered over and over again, until the inevitable tide of conquest on the other side set in, and the Empire fell.

On examining the earliest monuments of Dynasty XVIII. we are startled by their astonishing resemblance to those of Dynasty XI., a resemblance which would, had we no historical evidence on the other side, justify the leap of the Tablet of Abydos from Dynasty XII. to XVIII. This may be partly explained as a renaissance of art due to a royal descent traced rather to Dynasty XI. than Dynasty XII. Similarly under Dynasty XXVI. there was a renaissance of the art of the age of the early Memphite Dynasties. We must also not lose sight of the local character of Egyptian art and its intense conservatism, which may have preserved an ancient type through many centuries. The early art of Dynasty XVIII. has this character of a survival; that of Dynasty XXVI. is clearly a modern imitation.

The art of this age is in some respects the finest Egypt produced; it is, perhaps, best about the time of Thothmes III. and Amenophis IL, the middle of Dynasty XVIII. It is inferior in naturalism to the art of Dynasty IV., and in delicacy to that of Dynasty XII., but it has a certain splendour before wanting. After it had attained its highest point it slowly declined, partly from a decay in the vigour of the national character, perhaps more from the vast size of the later monuments, which must have led to a neglect of finish in the details, though this neglect can only be seen by one who is thoroughly acquainted with the Egyptian styles. At all times there is an invincible patience in the mastery of material and the execution of detail. The temples, not the kings’ tombs, are now the largest and most costly edifices; though a compromise with the old idea is effected by making grand temples as sepulchral chapels in religious connection with the royal tombs, commemorating in their sculptures the events of the reigns. The tombs of subjects do not maintain the proportion the earlier ones hold to the royal sepulchres. Their paintings have less of daily life, and religion takes a greater and growing place on the walls. We have, however, a multitude of interesting scenes, which show us a life more luxurious in the many than that of earlier times, but not as splendid in the few. There is more of feasting, of music, and the dance, less of country life and the welfare of the retainers. The royal tombs are now grottoes deeply cut in the rock, and the pictures of their walls are religious, the historical part being left to the funereal temples.

Amenhotep or Amenophis I., son of Aahmes and his Ethiopian queen, carried on the Ethiopian wars. It is of his son, the next king, Thothmes T., that the great eastern campaigns are first recorded. He advanced as far as the Euphrates, and must therefore have subdued, or at least marched through, the greatest part of Phoenicia and Syria. The prosperity of Egypt at this time is shown by the splendid works he executed in the great temple of Amen-ra at Thebes, the earliest of their kind that we can trace, and apparently the beginning of the series which was only to cease with the fall of the Empire. The employment of captives in public works was the main means by which they could be carried out. Probably after a time all that Egypt could do was to furnish men for the army, and in even this she failed when the dynasty came to an end. Before his death Thothmes I. had associated with him on the throne his daughter Hatshepu, or Hatasu (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 201), who succeeded him with her elder brother and husband Thothmes II. Her power is an evidence of the importance the

Egyptians attached to the female line. At the same time their dislike to be governed by a queen is evident in the attempt she subsequently made to assume the character of a king, being represented in male attire, a circumstance to which the monuments present no parallel.

After the seemingly uneventful reign of Thothmes II., Hatshepu was associated, apparently as regent, with her younger brother Thothmes III., and usurped the sole power. It is in this time that she appears as a king. She continued the works of the temple of Amen-ra, where the great obelisk and its fallen fellow bear her name. Her most interesting achievement was an expedition to Punt, either the Somâlee country or Arabia Felix. She collected a fleet on the Red Sea, and herself commanded it. The people accepted her rule, and she brought back great tribute, including small spice-trees, which she planted at Thebes. The glimpse we thus gain into the state of the civilization of the spice-growing countries at this remote age is most valuable, and explains the facility with which the southern dominions of Egypt were held. The nations in this direction were not masses of barbarous tribes, but their civilization did not take the direction of the pursuits of war.

Hatshepu had reigned about twenty-one years when Thothmes III. succeeded her. He carefully effaced her name on the monuments, substituting that of his brother and his own, and reckoned his reign from her accession. Whether he thus included his brother’s reign or not we do not know. With the sole reign of Thothmes III. a series of great expeditions begins, from the records of which we have great insight into the condition of Syria and Palestine about the 15 th century B.c.

It will be well here to glance for a moment at the Egyptian geography of this territory. There is great difficulty in explaining it, probably due to the different names apparently given to the same countries and peoples at one and the same time or at different times. We may, however, gain somewhat in clearness by observing that more than one important geographical name can only be an Egyptian appellative. Thus the Shasu, who were wander-, ing Arabs of the desert, who moved up as now into Palestine for pasturage or on predatory excursions, are nothing but “robbers." Most other names may be probably identified with Semitic equivalents. Syria is called Khal: this word is connected with Syria by the late equivalent Asher (ef. Maspero, Bist. Aηc., 181, note 1), which shows that the Egyptians then identified Syria and Assyria. The great nation of Syria in the time of Thothmes III. was the Ruten. These may be the Shemites of the stock of Lud, and may be also the Lydians in a primitive seat. Under Ramses II. the Kheta, a northern division of the Hittites, held the political position of the Ruten, as though the Ruten had migrated. As the Ruten probably represent the Aramaeans, so the Hittites represent the Canaanites. The Phoenicians appear to be the Kefa; in the time of Thothmes III. they held an insular position in the Mediterranean, probably Cyprus; under Ptolemy III., they give their name to Phoenicia. They are clearly the Biblical Caphtorim. The Philistines do not appear until the time of Ramses III. None of the primitive nations whom the Bible mentions as supplanted in the period before Joshua have been traced on the monuments, nor is there any clear notice before the time of Sheshonk I. (Shishak) of the Terahites. The period of Thothmes III. is one of Aramaean supremacy, that of Ramses II. of Canaanite; together they well correspond to the age before the Israelite conquest, while the condition of the time of Ramses III. suits the latest age of the Judges. The names of towns present less difficulty. Many are traceable in Biblical geography, and here but one indication occurs which may point to Israelite occupation.

The Egyptian conquests on the east being tributary, there were constant revolts on the accession of new sovereigns. It was thus that Thothmes III., on becoming sole ruler, had immediately to reduce the Ruten and their neighbours. This caused the series of eastern campaigns, which began in the twenty-second year, very early in his sole reign, and certainly extended to the forty-second, during which -whole time there was seldom a year of repose. The history of these wars is told in the Annals of Thothmes III., which contrast favourably with those of the Assyrian kings.
[9:7:738]

If they were marked by barbarity, there is no boast of ought but conquest and the levying of tribute. The tribute no less than a contemporary painting shows the great material civilization of the Asiatic states. Throughout, the Ruten are the most formidable enemies; the Kheta only appear. The first great achievement was the defeat before Megiddo of a confederacy led by the prince of Ketesh, or Kadesh on the Orontes. In the battle only 83 of the enemy were killed, and 340 taken prisoners; but the magnitude of the success is proved by the capture of 2232 horses, 924 chariots, and the speedy surrender of Megiddo. This town, as in Josiah’s time, was the key of the route to the Euphrates, and on its capture the king of the Ruten and the king of Assur are mentioned as becoming tributaries. In the course of the wars Kadesh was captured twice, and the king of Egypt marched as far as Nineveh, and the name of Babel is mentioned. The reign of Thothmes was also marked by expeditions in Ethiopia, and then we first meet with the supposed Egyptian name of the Danai, with whom he came in contact during some expedition in the Mediterranean. Great buildings commemorate this active reign, and we have a glimpse of the personal character of the king in the eccentric architecture of one of his additions to the temple of Amen-ra at Thebes. After a reign of 54 years 11 months, reckoning from the accession of Hatshepu, Thothmes III. was succeeded by his son Amenophis II.

The accession of the new king was marked by a war in Assyria, in which he captured Nineveh. An incident of his eastern campaigns is remarkable for its Oriental barbarism. He brought back to Egypt the bodies of seven kings whom he had slain with his own hands. The heads of six were placed on the walls of Thebes; the seventh was sent to remote Napata in Ethiopia to be hung on the walls to strike terror into the negroes. After a prosperous but probably short reign, Amenophis II. was succeeded by his son Thothmes IV., of whom we only know that he maintained his father’s empire during a reign that probably did not exceed the nine years assigned to him by Manetho.

Amenophis III. succeeded his father, and, during a long and it seems mainly pacific reign, occupied himself in great architectural works. Two temples at Thebes owe their origin to him, that on the western bank, which was the funereal temple of his tomb in the western valley beyond, and of which little now remains but the two great statues in the plain, the Vocal Memnon and its fellow, and also the temple of El-Uksur on the eastern bank. In his time the dimensions of the structures of the earlier kings are surpassed, and the proportions of the greatest monuments of the Empire are almost attained. Probably he was the first of the family after Aahmes who took a foreigner to wife. On the great scarabaei which commemorate his marriage with Queen Taï, we are informed that his rule extended from Mesopotamia to Southern Ethiopia.

Amenophis IV., the son of this foreign marriage, is the most perplexing character in ancient Egyptian history. Under his mother’s influence he introduced a new religion, the worship of Aten, the solar disk, and after a time wholly suppressed the national religion, even changing his name to Khu-n-aten. Abandoning Thebes as the capital, he founded a new city in Middle Egypt, where he constructed a chief temple to Aten, and near which his officials excavated their tombs in the mountain. The type under which the king and his family and subjects are represented is unlike any other in Egyptian art. They are all of emaciated and distended figure, and surpassing ugliness. The king is treated with a servile respect nowhere else seen on the monuments. His troops are mixed with foreign mercenaries. But we do not hear of foreign expeditions; every one is occupied in the duties of the new religion, without polytheism or idols. Flowers are the chief offerings and adorn the temple throughout; hymns chanted to the sound of harps are the form of worship. Was this a foreign religion, or an Egyptian restoration of primitive belief? If it were Egyptian why was the sun called Aten, not Ra? The king was the son of a foreigner, and his type and that which marks his court, probably because some were of his mother’s race, and art assumed the fashionable type for the rest, is not recognizable in any of the characteristic representations of foreign races. It is neither Ethiopian nor Shemite nor Libyan. The names of his mother and of her parents, the name of the sun-god, which is Egyptian, and the character of the worship, do not as far as we know point to any of these races. Certainly they are not Semitic. For race and religion we must probably look beyond the horizon of the Egyptian conquests. The type is not without an Indian aspect, and the religion has in its simplicity and the character of its worship a striking likeness to Vedism.

Khu-n-aten had seven daughters and no son. His successor Aï was his foster-brother and the husband of his eldest daughter. Under him the national religion was tolerated. Two other sons-in-law succeeded. Their line then or soon after came to an end, on the accession of Harem-heb, or Horus, who claimed to be the legitimate successor of Amenophis III., either by descent or on account of the innovations of Khu-n-aten, who with the kindred kings does not appear in the monumental lists, in which Har-em-heb is seen as the immediate successor of Amenophis III. The same order is followed in Manetho’s list, in which the house of Khu-n-aten follows Horus. What time this line lasted we do not know. Probably it did not exceed a generation. Horus occupied himself in destroying the monuments of Khu-n-aten and his successors, and no doubt in fully restoring the national religion.

Another family gained the throne after the reign of Horus, that of the Ramessides, forming Dynasties XIX. and XX.^[47. The chronology of Dynasty XIX. presents one great difficulty. We cannot determine the length of the reign of Setee I. Manetho assigns him more than 50 years, which is most improbable, as Ramses reigned 6 7 years, and his father and mother were married before his father’s succession. Ramses dates from his accession as sole king, and therefore we cannot include a period of co-regency in the Manethonian numbers for Sethos. The size and beauty of Setee’s tomb would imply a reign of not under 30 years. The length of the Dynasty cannot have been less than 130 years, and was perhaps as much as 150. It comprised three generations and the rest of the probably long life of the king (Setee II.) whose birth marked the third, which would give 100 + 40 ?) about 140 years for the total duration.] Ramses I., who seems to have been of Lower Egyptian extraction, and not impossibly connected by ancestry with the Shepherd kings, seized the royal power, maintained his authority abroad by campaigns in the south and the east, and concluded a treaty of peace with the king of the Hittites. After a very short reign he left the crown to his son Setee I., or Sethos, who strengthened his rights by marrying Taï, a granddaughter of Amenophis III. Ramses II., the son of this marriage, thus became legitimate king, and Setee made him his colleague at a very early age, no doubt to conciliate the Egyptians, a position at first ignored, evidently owing to the difficulty of defining it, but which ended in the virtual abdication of Setee (Maspero, Hist. Λnc., 215-217). The troubles that preceded the reign of Ramses I. must have weakened the foreign dominion of Egypt. Wars in the east occupied the earliest years of Setee. The Kheta had now succeeded to the Ruten in the supremacy of Northern Syria. Although Setee conquered the Kheta and captured Kadesh, now their chief town, the war ended by the conclusion of a second treaty between the Egyptian and Hittite kings. It is not necessary to suppose, with M. Maspero {Hist. Anc., 215), that the Egyptian Empire was already waning, because it was thus barred off from Further Asia and obliged to meet the Hittite king on [9:7:739] equal terms. The conditions were no doubt changed from those of the time of Thothmes III., but the list of the confederacy which the next king of the Kheta led against Ramses II., compared with that which Thothmes defeated at Megiddo, shows that the Kheta could bring into the field much more formidable allies than did the Ruten. Moreover there was a change in the foreign policy of Egypt. Phoenicia and Palestine were ruled by means of a chain of fortresses held by Egyptian garrisons. (Brugsch, Hist., 1 ed. 135; Maspero, Hist. Anc., 215.) If the Empire was narrowed in its limits, it was more solidly ruled; and this is quite consistent with the conclusion of a treaty with the Kheta. As a builder Setee I. is only equalled by Ramses II. He constructed the great hall of columns of El-Karnak, on the outside of the north wall of which he commemorated his victories in a series of most interesting sculptures. His splendid tomb is in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings.

Ramses II. is without doubt the greatest figure in the long line of the Pharaohs, and at the same time he is the one of whose character we have the best idea. His early training was in war and in government, for it cannot be a pure figure of speech by which the tablet found near Dakkeh in Nubia says that when he was but ten years old no monuments were executed without his orders (Brugsch, Hist., 1 ed. 137). This position was due to his superior right to the throne. Before the death of Setee I. the maritime nations of the Mediterranean made a descent on Egypt. The Shardana, or Sardones, and the Tuirsha, or Tyrseni, allied with the Libyans in this enterprise. Rainses defeated them so effectually that they do not seem to have again attacked Egypt till the reign of his son Menptah, about seventy years or more later. The captives of the Shardana instead of being employed in public works were enrolled in the king’s guard. After an expedition against Ethiopia, Ramses, on the death of Setee, returned to Egypt. Early in his sole reign the peace between the Egyptians and the Hittites was broken. The king of the Hittites formed a great confederacy. The nations of Asia Minor, the Mysians, the Lycians, the Dardans, the people of Ilium, are found in the list of the poem of Pentaur, the Egyptian Ramesseid, which appropriately records the oldest war in which Troy had a part. To bring together the army of the confederates time must have been needed. Probably the war was determined on by the Hittites on the accession of the new king. The great campaign was that of the fifth year of Ramses. The decisive battle was preceded by a repulse, when the Egyptian army, deceived by the Arabs (Shasu), were suddenly, while on the march, attacked and routed by the enemy, who numbered no less than 2500 warchariots. It was only by the personal bravery of Ramses that the Egyptians escaped destruction. This incident is the main subject of the poem of Pentaur. But on the next day the great battle was fought; the confederates were beaten and retreated into Kadesh. The Hittite king now sued for peace, which was granted. It was speedily broken. In his eighth year Ramses took Shalam, probably Salem or Jerusalem, Maram (Merom), and Tapur (Dabir? near Mount Tabor), Bethanath, and Kanιon. In his eleventh year he captured Ascalon. The war does not seem to have been ended until the Hittite king Khetasar proposed conditions of peace which he brought to Ramses written on a silver tablet. The treaty concluded on these bases in the twenty-first year of Ramses is sculptured at El-Karnak. It is a most interesting document, being an alliance offensive and defensive, with articles of extradition, remarkable for their humanity, and others for the protection of commerce (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 222, 223). Both kings swore to observe the compact, which was a renewal of the previous treaties. It is remarkable that in this document the Hittite prince, instead of being called the “vile chief of the Kheta,” is now the “great king,” the style given to Ramses also. Γhe eldest daughter of the Hittite king was taken in marriage as queen by Ramses, in whose twenty-third year Khetasar visited his son-in-law in Egypt. This alliance does not seem to have been broken for full a century, and then by conquerors who overcame the resistance of the Kheta and carried them with them. The remainder of the reign of Ramses appears to have been undisturbed by great wars, and given up to those vast buildings which are found throughout Egypt and Nubia, and which give him the first place among the architect Pharaohs. About the thirtieth year of his reign, his fourth son, the eldest surviving, -was made regent, and on the death of this prince in the fiftyfifth year, Menptah the thirteenth son, now heir, took this post, holding it for the rest of his father’s reign, which ended in the sixty-seventh year. Ramses must then have been at least near a hundred years old, perhaps more.^[48. M. Maspero thinks Ramses II. was at least 50 in the 21st year of his reign {Hist. Aηc., 250). This would make him at least 93 at the time of his death, and 30 at his accession. The latter age is barely reconcilable with the fact of three of his sons of the restricted class, which is evidently composed of the children of successive queens, being engaged in the campaign of the 5th year. Putting his marriage at 16, we must allow at least 4 years for the birth of these three sons, and cannot suppose the youngest to have gone to war in his chariot under the age of 1 4. If so (16 + 4 + 14 = ) 34 is the lowest age for the fifth year, and 29 for the accession, or 49 for the 21st year. But it is obvious that probability is against these extreme limits, and the fact that Ramses outlived twelve of his sons of the shorter list is in favour of a greater age.] He married three queens, and apparently had by them 23 sons and at least 13 daughters. The whole number of his children was 170, of whom 111 were sons and 59 daughters. All are styled princes or princesses, but probably only the children of queens had the right of succession.

Menptah succeeded Ramses II. There are but few monuments of his reign. The principal event they relate is a great incursion into the Delta of the maritime nations of the Mediterranean allied with the Libyans. By this time the Pelasgic tribes had wrested the dominion of the sea from the Phoenicians. »Some causes, perhaps famines, had already disposed them to move from Asia Minor and the Greek islands, seeking new establishments in Egypt. The attempt that Ramses II. defeated in the lifetime of Setee

I. was now renewed, apparently on a more formidable scale. The king of the Rebu (Libyans), with the warriors of several tribes joined the Shardana (Sardones), the Shakalasha (Sikels), the Leku (Lycians), the Tuirsha (Tyrseni), and the Akaiusha (Achaeans). They had already entered Egypt and spread themselves over the west of the Delta, where they intended to settle, when the Egyptian forces attacked them and put them to rout after a battle of six hours’ duration. It is remarkable that in this confederacy the Shakalasha and Akaiusha are added to the former list, and the Leku, who were in the Hittite confederacy against Ramses II., now appear on the west. Everything indicates the growing strength of the maritime nations and that power of united action which marked the period of the Trojan War. For the time the invasion was checked, but the Empire was evidently failing. The Hittites, indeed, were true to the treaty, and during famine were supplied with corn from Egypt, and the external provinces seem to have continued quiet. But side by side with the kingly power that of the high priests of Amen-ra had grown to formidable dimensions, owing probably to the interest Ramses

II. and Menptah showed for Lower Egypt, which put the weight of Thebes on the side of the highest local functionary. Menptah was not immediately followed by his son Setee II. There intervened two reigns, those of Amen-meses and Siptali, the first of the Ramses family by descent, the second, apparently, by marriage. They appear to have [9:7:740] been of a branch holding a local principality. Setee II. succeeded them and restored the legitimate line. His reign dosed in anarchy. There was no longer one king: the chiefs of the nomes ruled and engaged in civil war. A worse period followed. A Syrian, Arisu by name, became chief of the nomarchs, society was dissolved, and the templeservices neglected. We are as yet unable to say how this revolution began. It seems to have had nothing to do with foreign wars, but to have been brought about by internal weakness. The time it lasted must have been long, according to the Papyrus of Ramses III., from which alone we know of it. There “many years” are assigned to the period of the nomarchs and “years” to the rule of the Syrian.

As the Exodus is now generally held to have occurred in the later years of Dynasty XIX., its place in Egyptian history may best be here noticed. The view referred to was first carefully worked out by Prof. Lepsius. It rests upon chronological and historical grounds. Manetho, apparently adopting a tradition, placed the Exodus in the reign of Menptah. The number of generations assigned in the Bible to the interval from the Exodus to Solomon would bring the former event to about the same time. This approximative date is in accordance with that of the Rabbinical chronology, b.c. 1314-13. The coincidence is, however, valueless, for the interval from the Exodus to the building of Solomon’s Temple, in the Rabbinical chronology, is that of the Hebrew text, 480 years. The date of the Exodus should therefore be about b.c. 1480. The difference between 1480 and 1314-13 is caused by an error in the date of the building of the Second Temple, which is put B.c. 354, only 46 years before the date of Alexander’s death, which is dated b.c. 308, or 15 years too late. There is thus a mistake of more than a century in so cardinal a date as the building of the Second Temple. If an event of this importance, occurring only 800 years before the drawing up of the chronology, is thus incorrectly dated, and a period of Jewish history obliterated, surely the date of the Exodus cannot rest upon any accurate information. The historical grounds are far stronger than the chronological. Manetho, relating, if we may trust Josephus, a current tradition (υπep ωv 8' o Mαv∈0ωv oυκ ίκ των πap' MιγυτrτlθLς γραμμάτων, άλλ’, ώς αυτός ωμολόγηκεν, εκ των άδεαπότως μυθολογούμενων 7rρ0ςτεθεLκεv, ύστερον εξελέγξω κατά μέρος, κ. τ. λ., Contr. Αρ., 16), and Josephus is here confirmed by the evidence which the narrative shows of historical inaccuracy, has given an account of the Exodus from an Egyptian point of view. This story is the fullest version of one current in various forme in antiquity. As Manetho tells it, the chief points are these. King Amenophis, identified by him with Menptah, who occurs in his lists as Amenophis and Ammenephthis, determined, under the advice of a priest of the same name as himself, Amenophis the son of Papis, to cleanse Egypt of all lepers and other unclean persons, whom, accordingly, he set to work in the quarries. On their petition he gave them the city Avaris, left in ruins by the Shepherds. Having occupied the city, they chose one of themselves, a priest of Heliopolis, by name Osarsiph, as their ruler, who changed his name to Moyses. He made laws particularly directed against the Egyptian religion, and sent messengers to Jerusalem to the Shepherds, who had been expelled by the Egyptians, asking their aid and promising to give them their old territory Avaris, and to assist them to subdue Egypt. Accordingly the Shepherds invaded Egypt, when Amenophis came against them, but for superstitious reasons did not fight them, and withdrew to the friendly king of Ethiopia, in whose country he remained thirteen years, hie ally protecting the southern Egyptian border. Meanwhile the people of Jerusalem and the unclean Egyptians ravaged Egypt, and destroyed everything connected with the national religion. Afterwards Amenophis and his son Sethos, also called Ramesses, returned and expelled the Shepherds and the unclean people. Chaeremon gives a similar account with the same name for the king. Lysimachus and Tacitus vary in calling the king Bocchoris.

The Egyptian evidence for the date of the Exodus would place it about this time. The geographical inquiries of Lepsius have been carried on by Brugsch, who, in a paper read before the Oriental Congress, has identified the principal geographical names of the narrative of the oppression and of the Exodus (Brugsch, H Exode). In particular, Rameses is shown to have been another name of Tanis. The occurrence of this name in Genesis and Exodus is most important as bearing on the date of the Exodus, for it is almost certain that it was given by Ramses IL, who rebuilt the great temple of the town. Another cardinal piece of evidence is the mention of the ’Aperiu, or ’Apuriu, as engaged in public works under Ramses II. and later kings, but not after Dynasty XX. In this name that of the Hebrews has been recognized. If the identification were certain we should have much reason for dating the oppression under Ramses IL, which would accord with the Exodus under Menptah.

The difficulties of this theory are not slight. On the chronological side Manetho’s date is only dependent on a tradition, and we cannot fix the chronology of the dynasty, b.c. 1300 for Menptah being about the middle point in a doubtful two centuries. The evidence of the Hebrew genealogies therefore is not conclusive for a date identical with that of Menptah, which we cannot yet say is irreconcilable with the chronology founded on the interval of 480 years from the Exodus to the building of Solomon’s Temple. If, however, the genealogies are to be taken as a guide for the chronology up to the Exodus, Egyptologists prefer for the period of the sojourn the longer intervals stated in the Hebrew text to the very short ones that would result from the genealogical method. Still greater difficulties arise when we give a critical examination to Manetho’s story. It reads like a perverted narrative of the calamities which closed Dynasty XIX., for we cannot suppose two conquests by Asiatics and two expulsions, one by Menptah and Setee IL, the other by Set-nekht, who subdued the Syrian, nor resort to the violent hypothesis that the Papyrus of Ramses III. attributes to Set-nekht that which Setee II. achieved. The name of Amenophis is suspicious, the two names of his son Sethos, “who is Ramesses,” still more so; the recall of the Shepherds from Jerusalem, and the easy conquest of Egypt without a battle, all read like a legend founded on a fusion of the two periods of Eastern occupation. There is, moreover, another suspicious circumstance in the occurrence of the name of Bocchoris in two versions of the story. This would either point to Bocchoris of Dynasty XXIV., in whose time it is quite possiblo that there was a large number of Israelite fugitives in Egypt, or to some other king of the same or a similar name; we do not, however, know of any earlier Bocchoris. It may be reasonably asked whether this story has anything to do with the Exodus. Those who hold that it has yet, in common with all Egyptologists, argue, when they examine the Biblical data, on the ground of the minute accuracy of many of these data. If, then, the two narratives, that of Manetho and that of the Papyrus of Ramses III., relate to the Exodus, it may reasonably be inferred that the Manethonian is a faulty and distorted one. It is, however, quite possible that Manetho may have known when the Exodus happened, and yet may have confused it with an event of the same period. The argument from the Biblical data that Ramses II. ruled during the oppression of the Israelites is very strong, though it may be conjectured that a redactor has substituted the later name Rameses for the earlier Zoan.
[9:7:741]

The name of the Αρeriu, if certainly that of the Hebrews, would be decisive, but it is not a proper Egyptian equivalent, and so exact are the transcriptions of Semitic geographical names into Egyptian, that upon them mainly depends the theory of the sounds of the Egyptian alphabet developed byM. de Rougé and adopted by Dr Brugsch. Here, again, the evidence is inconclusive.

The arguments which would place the Exodus in any other period of Egyptian history are but slight. There is indeed the remarkable occurrence of a name similar to that of Jacob, or identical with it, in a record^ the conquests of Thothmes III.^[49. In tins list Iakab-aar is read by Μ. de Rongé as representing Jacob-el, a form like Nathaniel for Nathan (Rev. Arch., ms. iv., 370).] This may only be a reminiscence of Jacob, as M. de Rougé suggests, but it would be more natural to take it to indicate that the Exodus was anterior to the time of Thothmes, and there are other names in the list which may possibly point to the same conclusion.^[50. The chronology of Dynasties XX. and XXI. is extremely obscure. We know that Ramses III. reigned 32years, and Ramses XI. or XII. upwards of 32 years. The six successors of Ramses III. probably had very short reigns, as all but the second and sixth were certainly sons of that king, and the sixth probably. The other kings are represented by few monuments. Her-har, however, may have had a longer reign, the sculptures of the temple of Klιons at Thebes giving this impression. There does not seem, however, to be any ground for a duration of more than a century until the Tanites of Dynasty XXI. rose into power. The latest Theban kings probably held a local and constantly diminishing authority for part of the time of the Tanites, of whom the records are extremely scanty and the chronology consequently obscure. Two centuries is a probable measure of the whole interval.] Yet the preponderance of evidence is at present greatly in favour of the occurrence of the Exodus towards the close of Dynasty XIX. It is not, however, necessary to accept the date of Prof. Lepsius, in our present state of uncertainty as to the chronology of Dynasty XIX. It is also not a necessary consequence of accepting this historical synchronism, that we should take Manetho’s narrative of the Exodus as more than his identification with it of an event of the same period. These may seem but unsatisfactory results of the great erudition which has been bestowed on this question. We refrain from speaking more positively when a discovery may at any moment render speculation needless.

If the Exodus took place towards the close of Dynasty XIX., when did the period of oppression and the government of Joseph fall? The reckoning by generations would place Joseph in the later part of Dynasty XVIII., and the oppression under Ramses II. downwards. It is, however, very generally acknowledged that this method of computation is not consistent with the growth of the Israelites from a family to a nation during the sojourn in Egypt. Scholars are therefore disposed to choose a reckoning by years. Here the Biblical data give either 430 years exactly for the sojourn and 400 for the oppression, or else 215 years for the sojourn. The longer periods are those generally preferred. If we reckon by them, the government of Joseph would have fallen under the last Shepherd king, and the oppression would have probably begun under Aahmes, to be greatly increased in intensity under Ramses II.

Set-nekht, a chief probably of the line of Ramses IL, overthrew the Syrian intruder and again restored the Egyptian monarchy. His short reign, which begins Dynasty XX., 2 was probably entirely occupied in reorganizing the administration of Egypt. Ramses III., whom his father had already made his colleague (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 262), succeeded to a united Egypt but a distracted Empire. Evidently in the time of anarchy every province and tributary state had fallen away. The new king was equal to the effort of repelling invasion at home and reconquering lost territory abroad. In his fifth year he defeated the Libyan tribes who had invaded the west of Lower Egypt.

In his eighth, he met another attack from the opposite quarter. The Taanau (Danai Î) and the Takkaru (Teucrians), who now first appear, forming with the Tuirsha (Tyrseni), Wa-shasha (Oscansl), Shakalasha (Sikels), Leka (Lycians), and Pelesta (Philistines), a great confederation, which attacked the east of Egypt by sea and land. Their army conquered and carried with i·t the Kheta and neighbouring tribes. Their fleet, manned by the Takkaru and Shardana, reached Egypt at the same time. The Egyptian army and fleet encountered and defeated them. This campaign, and particularly the sea-fight, form the subjects of interesting reliefs in the great sepulchral temple built by Ramses III. in western Thebes. In his eleventh year a second invasion of the west of Egypt, by the Libyans, aided by the Tuirsha and the Leka, was equally unsuccessful. The eastern provinces and tributary states were recovered, and an expedition was sent to the Somâlee country on the eastern coast of Africa or Arabia Felix. This last great conqueror finally preserved Egypt from the maritime nations. The course of their migrations seems to have been changed. All that remained of their invasions were the Philistine settlement in Palestine and one of the Mashuasha, a Libyan tribe, in the Delta, from whose race the Egyptians drew mercenaries (Maspero, Hist. Λnc., 266). The importance of these forces is evident in the Biblical notices of Egypt of the time of the Hebrew kings.

The historical value of the Egyptian notices of the primitive populations of the Mediterranean is being more and more perceived. It is at first perplexing that we find the nations afterwards settled in well-known seats either far to the east or in constant movement. Yet the key thus afforded to the earliest Greek colonization is most valuable, and it is significant of the historical character of the documents that new names appear, as we should expect, in such a manner äs to explain the confusion of the Greek terms, which speak of Achaeans and Danai, Dardans and Teucri, at the same time indifferently, whereas the Egyptian documents show that they are not interchangeable. Ramses III., besides constructing the magnificent temple at Medeenet Haboo, enriched the temples of Egypt with splendid gifts, during a prosperous reign of thirty-two years. The later kings of the dynasty do not appear to have achieved anything remarkable. They maintained the Empire, but their authority at home waned, while that of the high-priests of Amen grew until, towards the close of the dynasty, Her-har, one of these high-priests, gained the royal power. Probably the close of the dynasty was occupied by a struggle between the last Ramesside kings and the high-priests, as well as by the additional distraction caused by the rise of another line, Dynasty XXI., of Tanite kings. Probably the Tanites ultimately gained the sole authority. The high-priests of Amen-ra, about this time, certainly not later than the rise of Dynasty XXII., retreated to Ethiopia, where they founded a kingdom, of which the capital was Napata. The Pharaoh whose daughter Solomon married was, if Manetho’s numbers are correct, Psusennes IL, Har-Psiunkha, last king of Dynasty XXI. He seems to have endeavoured to restore the military power of Egypt, for he made an expedition into Canaan and captured the town of Gezer, which he gave to his daughter, Solomon’s queen.

During the later period of the Empire, partly through marriages of the Pharaohs, partly in consequence of the large employment of mercenaries, chiefly Libyans, great settlements of foreigners, Asiatic as well as African, were established in Egypt. So far from the Shemites being then disliked, a multitude of Semitic words were introduced into Egyptian, and it even became the fashion to give a Semitic form to native words (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 337, 338). A Shemite family, settled at Bubastis, or in the Bubastite [9:7:742] nome, succeeded by the command of mercenaries and by alliances with the Tanite family in establishing a new royal line, Dynasty XXII., which is remarkable for its foreign names. The royal names Sheshonk, Osorkon, Takelot are all either Assyrian or Babylonian. Still more striking is the name Nemrut, or Nimrod, borne by non-kingly members of the family. Probably it came from the further East.

Sheshonk I., the Shishak of the Bible, may have gained the royal power peaceably. His son Osorkon married the daughter of the last king of the Tanite Dynasty, to whom Sheshonk succeeded. He seems early to have entertained the design of restoring the Egyptian rule in the East, for he received Jeroboam when he fled from Solomon. The revolt of the Ten Tribes enabled him to carry out this project, and late in his reign he marched against Rehoboam, and returned with the treasures of the Temple and the palace. A remarkable sculpture at the temple of El-Karnak gives a list of 130 names of towns and peoples conquered by Shishak in this expedition. Long as is the list, it is not like the rolls of the conquerors of the Empire. The items are far less important, and the Hagarenes recur several times, as if to record the subjugation of a series of small Bedawee tribes. Cities of Judah and Israel appear in the list, but the towns in the kingdom of Jeroboam seem to be Levite and Canaanite, and it is probable that the Israelite king was not averse to their overthrow. With this occurrence we gain the first good chronological footing in Egyptian history. The Hebrew chronology is indeed not as yet fixed. The Assyrian monuments seem to indicate a reduction of at least twenty-three years in the ordinary dates. The invasion of Shishak is ordinarily dated b.c. 971, but may thus have to be lowered to about u.c. 948; and as it probably took place in about the twentieth year of the Egyptian king’s reign, his accession may be dated approximately b.c. 967.

The government of Egypt under the kings of Dynasty XXII. underwent an important change. They made the high-priesthood of Amen-ra an office of a prince of the family, usually the eldest son, and gave high governments to other princes. Thus the power of the Pharaoh ultimately became merely nominal, and Egypt resolved itself into an aggregate of principalities. A further cause of decay was the importance of the Libyan mercenaries which each of the princes commanded. Under a new dynasty, XXIII., said to be of Tanites, but probably kindred to the Bubastitβ3, Egypt was, for a time at least, reunited under a single rule, but towards its close the process of disintegration had already again set in, and the country was divided among nearly twenty princes, at least four of whom took the royal insiguia (Maspero, ∕f⅛i. Anc., 378 seqqj).

Among these small princes but one was capable of attempting to reunite Egypt under his rule. This was Tafnekht, Tnephachthos, prince of Sais, who reduced great part of the country, and would probably have achieved complete success, had not the yet unconquered princes called in the priest-king of Napata, Piankhi Meriamen. While Egypt bad declined, Ethiopia had constantly risen, and at this time part of the Thebais owed it allegiance. Piankhi, the descendant of the priest-kings of Thebes, was not unwilling to recover his ancient dominions. Tn one brilliant campaign he defeated Tafnekht and his allies, captured their strongholds, and obtained the sovereignty of Egypt, leaving the small princes to rule as his vassals. The ancient Empire was thus in part restored, but as it was ruled from Ethiopia, and the little princes constantly strove for independence, it had no real durability. Piankhi was succeeded by Kashta, who was probably an Ethiopian, owing his throne to his intermarriage with a princess of the Theban line.

Bokenranf, or Bocchoris, son and successor of Tafnekht, no doubt seizing this occasion, was able to carry out the project of his father and make himself king of Egypt. After a short reign marked by energy and prudence he perished in a fresh Ethiopian invasion. . Shabak, or Sabakon, conquered Egypt, and having taken Bokenranf in his capital, Sals, put him to a cruel death. It was no longer an Egyptian prince who ruled atNapata; all the circumstances we know of Shabak and his dynasty indicate an Ethiopian line, governing Egypt as a conquered country, not as their ancient territory. Still Shabak’s connection with the priestly line was not forgotten. His sister,Queen Ameniritis, governed Thebes, and the power of the local rulers was limited, not destroyed. Hoshea, king of Israel, sent presents to Shabak,^[51. "With this transaction Shabak’s record at El-Karnak of the tributes of Syria has been connected (Maspero, Hist. Aηe. t 390).] who was subsequently drawn into a confederacy of Syrian and other princes against Sargon king of Assyria, but, as in all these wars, the Ethiopian king was a tardy ally. His capital lay too far south, and in crossing the eastern border of Egypt he left the ill-affected princes of the Delta in the line of his communications. He therefore came into the field too late, and it was but little east of Egypt that he met the Assyrians and experienced a disastrous defeat at Raphia. He lost great part of Egypt, in which the small princes again established themselves, now as vassals of Assyria, Shabak only retaining Ethiopia and part of Upper Egypt.

Shabatok, or Sebichus, was the son and successor of Shabak. He made himself supreme king in Egypt, but appears to have lost Ethiopia to Tahraka. Towards the close of his reign the Egyptian dynasts joined in an alliance against Sennacherib, who had recently succeeded Sargon. The confederates were defeated, or made their submission one by one. The Egyptian princes lost a battle in southern Palestine, in the territory of their ally Hezekiah, who was the last in the East to submit. But the Egyptians again advanced, encouraged by Tahraka, king of Ethiopia, who marched to their support. No battle was fought. The Assyrians moved against the Egyptians, but in one night the invading army perished,and Sennacherib fled to Nineveh. The tradition of the Egyptians agrees with Biblical history in relating the destruction of the Assyrians as miraculous; and it should be noted that for the rest of his reign Sennacherib never ventured again to invade Palestine. During this interval of respiteTahrakaenteredEgypt,slewShabatok, and made himself master of the whole country (b.c. 692).

After twenty years of what seems to have been a peaceful reign, the Assyrian w ar began afresh, Esarhaddon, son and successor of Sennacherib, resolving on the subjugation of Egypt. Tahraka was vanquished and fled to Napata, and Memphis and Thebes were taken. The country was divided between twenty princes, with Neku I. of Sal's as their chief. The fortresses were garrisoned with Assyrian troops (b.c.672). Tn a few years, however,Tahraka returned, defeated the Assyrians, and captured Memphis. In commemoration of the earlier subjugation or of this one, the Ethiopian king puts the name of Egypt among those of conquered nations not only at Napata but also at Thebes (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 427; Brυgsch, Hist., 1 ed., 244, 245). Soon after Esarhaddon abdicated in favour of his son Asshur-bani-pal, who speedily invaded and reconquered Egypt, driving out Tahraka and restoring the tributary princes. As soon, however, as he had left, a conspiracy broke out, and these chiefs sent emissaries to Tahraka. They w erc overcome by the Assyrians, and Neku and two others sent in chains to Nineveh, before Tahraka could come to their aid. But he again reconquered Thebes and Memphis. Asshur-bani-pal now made a politic use of the Egyptian party, treated Neku with honour, and sent him back to Egypt as ruler of Sals, giving a second principality to his son Psametik. Neku returned to find that Tahraka [9:7:743] had left Egypt (b.c. 666). Urdamen, Tahraka’s son-in-law and successor, held Upper Egypt, and at once attacked the Assyrians, captured Memphis from them, and took Neku, whom he put to death, while Psametik fled into Syria. Asshur-bani-pal now invaded Egypt, defeated Urdamen, and sacked Thebes, carrying the whole population captive. The twenty principalities were again set up, but Psametik was not the chief.

After a time the Egyptian princes became independent of Assyria, but they had once more to submit to au Ethiopian invader, Nouat-Meiamen, who reconquered the country without much difficulty, but does not seem to have Ion» held it. The Saite prince Psametik, whose ambition excited the jealousy of the other dynasts, at last achieved the object for which his predecessors had pertinaciously fought. By the aid of Carian and Ionian mercenaries lie put down his rivals, and by a marriage with the niece of Shabak rendered his line legitimate. This alliance with a princess only a generation younger than the first Ethiopian king brings into striking relief the vicissitudes which Egypt underwent during the Assyrian wars. Calamities were crowded into those years which usually occupy centuries. Yet under the new king, who was the real founder of Dynasty XXVI., Egypt rapidly recovered, and during the rule of his successors it was for the first time since the Empire strong and united, enjoying a true national existence. Public works of all kinds were carried on with energy. Art, which had fallen under the Bubastites and their followers, now suddenly revived, and with its recovery the ideas of the primitive dynasties came into fashion. The style of the age may be best compared with that of Dynasties IV. and V. It is, however, wanting in vigour, using elongated forms and abundant details. Still it has an elegance and a mastery of material which show that Egypt had not lost the true feeling of its art, in spite of the disastrous wars which had threatened the overthrow of all the institutions of the country.

Psametik I., or Psammetichus, employed his long reign in strengthening Egypt and in restoring the temples and making additional monuments. He recovered from Ethiopia a part of Lower Nubia, and made a successful expedition into Philistia. His designs of conquest were, however, frustrated by a wholesale desertion of Egyptian troops, caused by jealousy of the Ionian and Carian mercenaries to whom Psametik owed his throne. The mutineers, whose number IL·rodotus puts at 240,000 men, were too strong to be resisted, and deaf to the king’s intreaties marched to Ethiopia and received lands from the king of that country. All that the Egyptian sovereign could do was to form a new army and build a fleet. He thus missed the opportunity afforded by the decline of Nineveh of winning back the influence Egypt had long lost in the East. An interesting memorial of his reign is the Greek inscription on one of the colossi of Aboosimbel, in Nubia, recording the visit of mercenary and Egyptian troops.

Neku II.,b.c. 611, son and successor of Psametik, inherited his father’s energy but not his prudence. He attempted to complete an enterprise of the Empire and connect the Red Sea with the Nile, and so with the Mediterranean, by a canal. Under his orders Phoenician seamen circumnavigated Africa. Less fortunate was his attempt to recover the eastern rule of Egypt. He marched against Megiddo, still the key to the route to the Euphrates. Here he was met by the forces of Josiah, king of Judah, with whom he unwillingly fought. Josiah was slain, and the king of Egypt advanced to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Thus the Egyptian Empire was for a moment restored. There was no great eastern rival to contest its supremacy. Assyria had fallen, Babylon was not yet firmly established. After about three years Nabopolassar, the king of Babylon, sent his son Nebuchadnezzar against the Egyptians. At Carchemish the armies met. Neku was defeated, and the Egyptian rule in the East finally destroyed. Soon after the king of Egypt died, leaving his throne to his son Psametik IL, B.c. 595, whose short reign was only marked by an expedition against the king of Ethiopia. The next king, Psametik’s son, Uahabra, or A pries, the Pharaoh Hophra of Scripture, B.c. 590, inherited the energy and ambition of the Saite house. His accession was the signal for a general confederation of Palestine and Phoenicia against the king of Babylon. The war was speedily ended by the capture of Jerusalem, which Uahabra in vain endeavoured to prevent. He was, however, successful at sea. His Greek ships beat the Phoenician fleet of Nebuchadnezzar, and for a time he held the Phoenician coast, and aided Tyre in a resistance of thirteen years against the Babylonian besiegers. A great disaster lost Uahabra his throne. He engaged in a war with the Greeks of Cyrene. His Egyptian troops were defeated. The native soldiers believed that he had planned their destruction that he might put mercenaries in their place. They revolted and chose Aahmes, or Amasis, king. Amasis defeated the mercenary troops of Uahabra and dethroned him, B.c, 571. It is to this time that the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar is assigned by Josephus. The silence of Herodotus and the other Greek historians, and the prosperity of Egypt under Amasis, have induced modern scholars to suppose that Josephus based his statement on the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel. If, however, we read between the lines of the story of Herodotus, we need some other cause than the disaffection of the Egyptian troops to account for the sudden success of Amasis, and especially for his easy defeat of the mercenaries with a discouraged native force. Again, the conquests of Egypt by the Assyrians, though predicted by Isaiah and noticed as past by Nahum, are unrecorded by Herodotus and the Greeks. The prosperity of the country in the reign of Amasis might as easily follow a Babylonian conquest as that under Psametik I. followed the terrible Assyrian wars. The scantiness of the native records of Nebuchadnezzar’s reign leaves us without Babylonian evidence.

Amasis took to wife a grand-daughter of Psametik I. and his heiress-queen Shapentap, thus legitimatizing his pretensions. He greatly embellished the temples of Egypt. It may be that, as in the time of Psametik I., they needed restoration. His foreign policy was marked by energy and caution. He transferred the Ionian and Carian mercenaries to Memphis itself as a force of guards. He granted the Greeks the free use of Naucratis as a Hellenic settlement and trading port. He conquered Cyprus, and kept up the influence of Egypt in Phoenicia. He had friendly relations with the Greek states, and instead of conducting an expedition against the Babylonians during their Empire or against the rapidly rising power of the Persians, he joined in an alliance of which Croesus, king of Lydia, was the head, and agreed to furnish him with an Egyptian contingent in his war with Cyrus. After the fall of Croesus other wars kept Cyrus from any designs on Egypt, and it was not until the accession of his son Cambyses that the Persians could attempt its reduction. Meanwhile Amasis died, leaving the crown to his son Psametik III., the Psammenitus of Herodotus, who, after a single well-fought battle near Pelusium, and the capture of Pelusium and Memphis, lost his kingdom, B.c. 525.

Cambyses, as we learn from the narrative of the Egyptian priest Uta-har-sun of Sal's, at first adopted the style of a Pharaoh, and was initiated into the mysteries of Neith at Sals It was not until the failure of an expedition against the Oasis of Ammon, and of another directed by himself against the Ethiopian kingdom of Napata, that Camb) ses, probably aware of the satisfaction the Egyptians must have [9:7:744] felt at these reverses, changed his policy, and vented his rage upon the monuments and objects of worship in Egypt. The Saite priest, in general terms, describes this as a time of calamity such as had never before befallen his country. Cambyses left Egypt, which was so completely crushed that the subsequent usurpation of the Magian was marked by no revolt. One of the first cares of Darius I. was to charge Uta-har-sun with the restoration of the disordered country. In a visit to Egypt at the moment when a revolt had broken out, he pacified the people by supporting their religion, in the most marked contrast to Cambyses. For the rest of his reign he endeavoured to promote the commercial welfare of Egypt, in particular opening the canal from the Nile to the Red Sea. In the Great Oasis he built a temple to Ammon. It was not until the very close of his reign that the Egyptians rose against his rule, and expelled the Persians, choosing as king Khabbash, whose name has been discovered in the Sarapeum. The revolt lasted but three years, and Xerxes I. suppressed it with severity. Achaemenes, the brother of Xerxes, was made satrap. Egypt did not again rise until the troubles which marked the accession of Artaxerxes I. The insurrection was led by Tnaros, prince of Marea, who immediately concluded an alliance with the Athenians. Supported by 200 Athenian triremes, he defeated and slew the satrap Achaemenes, and besieged in the citadel of Memphis the remnant of the Persian army, which, though it included Egyptian soldiers, held out until the attacking force was drawn off by a fresh Persian army. The Egyptians and their allies were now driven to the island of Prosopitis, and there besieged for eighteen months. At last Inaros was taken and put to death; Amyrtaeus, an Egyptian who reigned with him, fled to the marshes, where he long maintained himself. Artaxerxes, after this serious revolt of six years, modified the administration of Egypt, recognizing Thannyras, son of Inaros, and Pausiris, of Amyrtaeus, as vassal kings. The government was, however, held by a Persian satrap; these were merely local princes.

An Amyrtaeus, probably son of Pausiris (Maspero, Hist. Anc., 562), revolted, and on the death of Darius IL, B.c. 404, made Egypt virtually independent. He is the one king of Dynasty XXVIII., Saite. His successor, Naifaaurut I., founded Dynasty XXIX. of Mendesians, B.c. 399. With him the monuments, silent since the rising of Khabbash, again give us information, and under the next dynasty show that the Saite art still lived in spite of the misfortunes the country had undergone. The Mendesians Naifaaurut and Hakor are chiefly known for the part they took in aiding the enemies of Persia. Hakor was followed by Naifaaurut IL, and then the sovereignty passed to Dynasty XXX. of Mendesians, the last native Egyptian line. The first of these kings, Nekht-har-heb, or Nectanebes I., came to the throne when a Persian invasion was imminent, B.c. 378. Hakor had already formed a powerful army, largely composed of Greek mercenaries. This army Nekht-har-heb intrusted to the Athenian Chabrias. The Persians, however, succeeded in causing his recall and in gaining the services of his fellow-countryman Iphicrates. The invading army consisted of 200,000 barbarians under Pharnabazus and 20,000 Greeks under Iphicrates. After the Egyptians had experienced a reverse, Iphicrates counselled an immediate advance on Memphis. His advice was not followed by Pharnabazus; the Egyptian king collected his forces and won a pitched battle near Mendes. Pharnabazus retreated, and Egypt was free.

Nekht-har-heb was succeeded by Tachos or Teos, whose short reign was occupied by a war with Persia, in which the king of Egypt secured the services of a body of Greek mercenaries under the Spartan king Agesilaus and a fleet under the Athenian general Chabrias. He entered Phoenicia with every prospect of success· but having offended Agesilaus, he was dethroned in a military revolt which gave the crown to Nekht-nebf, or Nectanebes IL, the last native king of Egypt. At this moment a revolt broke out. The prince of Mendes almost succeeded in overthrowing the new king. Agesilaus defeated the rival pretender, and left Nekht-nebf established on the throne. But the opportunity of a decisive blow against Persia was lost. The new king, Artaxerxes III. Ochus, determined to reduce Egypt. A first expedition was defeated by the Greek mercenaries of Nekht-nebf, but a second, commanded by Ocbus himself, subdued Egypt with no further resistance than that of the Greek garrison of Pelusium. Nekht-nebf, instead of endeavouring to relieve them, retreated to Memphis and fled thence to Ethiopia, B.c. 3401 Thus miserably fell the monarchy of the Pharaohs after an unexampled duration of nearly 3000 years, or as some think far longer. More than 2000 years have since passed, and though Egypt has from time to time been independent, not one native prince has sat on the throne of the Pharaohs. “There shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt” (Ezek. XXX. 13) was prophesied in the days of Apries as the final state of the land.

The causes of the downfall of Egypt are sufficiently evident in the previous history. The weakness of the later Thebans fostered divisions. The Bubastites aided the natural tendency of the country to break up into small principalities. The Ethiopians, while they brought a new force to resist the Assyrians, increased the divisions of Egypt, which had to choose to which of two foreign empires it would submit. The Saltes restored nationality, but they maintained it at the cost of alienating the native troops, and thus could not effectually resist Persia. Although their gallant struggles brought out the fighting qualities of the Egyptians, these Pharaohs could never venture on a great λvar without Greek mercenaries. Hence constant discontent and an inharmonious military system. At length the native energy was worn out.

The barbarian Ochu3 used his success mercilessly, rivalling the worst acts of Cambyses. Under him and his successors Egypt made no movement, and when Alexander entered the country as the conqueror of Persia he was welcomed as a deliverer. The Persian governor had not forces enough to oppose him, and he experienced nowhere even the show of resistance. He visited Memphis, founded Alexandria, and went on pilgrimage to the oracle of Jupiter Ammon. He then organized the government under two officers, who from their names appear to have been a Greek and an Egyptian. He left the Egyptians satisfied with his reverence for their religion, and for the rest of his reign the country remained a peaceful province of his great empire. With Alexander, the Macedonian dominion began. It lasted for 302 years, after the Empire the brightest period of Egyptian history, during the whole of which no general native revolt broke out. From this time the Egyptian local princes, who for five centuries, except only during the rule of Psametik and his house, had caused all the divisions of Egypt, disappear from the scene. This final settlement was probably due to the policy of Alexander, under whose successors we see the real government of the country, with its centre in the Greek city he had founded, and the control of the army and navy, intrusted to Greeks; whereas the native religion was protected, but wholly left to the Egyptian priests, except so far as the king himself acted as one of the priesthood. Thus the foreigners had all the true power, while the natives were satisfied with a semblance of it, and the local importance this semblance gave to their functionaries. Routes of trade were actively pushed, and works of public benefit carried out, and the Egyptians grew more and more [9:7:745] wealthy, in Egyptian towns, where a Greek was rarely seen, and the king only appeared in the character of a Pharaoh to show respect to the religion of the country. The learned men of both races drew nearer together, and Greek speculation had its effect on Egyptian thought. The less cultivated settlers were attracted by the native superstitions, and at last the Alexandrian was far more an Egyptian than even a Macedonian.

On the division of Alexander’s dominions, Egypt fell to the share of Ptolemy, son of Lagus and Arsinoë, a concubine of Philip’s, whose son he was supposed to have been. Of all Alexander’s generals he was the most far-sighted. Instead of aiming at the rule of the empire, he secured the least exposed province and employed its resources rather for defence than offence. One of his first acts was to divert the burial of Alexander from Macedon to Egypt. The body was taken to Memphis, but under Ptolemy’s successor it was removed to Alexandria, so that the conqueror rested in the city he had founded. His first conquest was the Cyrenaica (b.c. 322), a valuable province outside the field of the contests of his rivals, yet greatly useful for naval enterprises against them. Yet he did not declare himself independent; as a subject of the phantom kings Philip Aridaeus and Alexander Aegus, he inscribed their names in his restorations of Egyptian temples, and alone of all the generals struck money in the name of Aegus so long as that last heir of Alexander lived. He was not long left in undisturbed occupation of his government. The regent Perdiccas, finding that Ptolemy was engaged in a league against his authority, marched into Egypt, B.c. 321; but the resistance of Ptolemy and a mutiny in the invader’s army, which resulted in his death, delivered Egypt from this danger. The succeeding years were occupied in attempts to add Coele-Syria and Phoenicia to the Egyptian dominions, which can scarcely be considered rash when we remember the importance of these provinces to the security of Egypt against invasion, and for winning of the maritime supremacy of the eastern Mediterranean. During this time Cyprus was made a dependency, and the Cyrenaica, which had revolted, was finally reduced by Ptolemy’s step-son Magas. A great calamity now arrested the growing power of Egypt, when Demetrius, son of Antigonus, defeated Ptolemy in a sea-fight off Salamis of Cyprus (b.c. 306). Antigonus then assumed the royal diadem, and Ptolemy followed his example. Antigonus and Demetrius immediately attacked Egypt, but without success; and Ptolemy, rapidly recovering his strength, aided the Rhodians when besieged by Demetrius (b.c. 305-4). It is related that when the siege was raised the Rhodians gave Ptolemy, as their “preserver,” the title of ‰τ-ηp. This appears in his hieroglyphic inscriptions as his distinctive title, and upon the coins of his successors struck in his name in Phoenicia. After this Ptolemy again attempted without success the conquest of Coele-Syria and Phoenicia, but ultimately seized and held Cyprus, b.c. 295, which thus became a part of the Egyptian monarchy for nearly its whole duration. His later years were passed in consolidating his power. Seleucus was master of a Syrian empire, too firmly ruled to be attacked with any chance of success, and stretching too far eastwards to make its master aggressive on the Egyptian border. The government of Egypt was assured by the care taken to maintain and increase the Greek element in the country. Alexandria was made a seat of Hellenic culture, and if it is not absolutely certain that Ptolemy founded the Library and the Museum, he undoubtedly gathered the necessary intellectual materials. The great Greek colony of Ptolemais, in the Thebais, was established. Thus the native and foreign elements were kept apart, conflicts avoided, and strong Hellenic centres secured. The Egyptians were flattered by the arrival of the image of Sarapis from Sinope and the spread over Egypt, under the king’s influence, of a Hellenic form of their religion. The king’s portrait on his coins shows us him in old age, and is distinguished by resolution, keenness, and craft.

Having ruled thirty-eight years, the old king abdicated in favour of his young son Philadelphus, chosen to the prejudice of his elder brothers (b.c. 285), and died two years later (b.c. 283).

Ptolemy Philadelphus rιded for thirty-eight years of almost undisturbed peace. His half-brother Magas, probably soon after the death of Ptolemy Soter, declared himself king in Cyrenaica, and attempted to invade Egypt. Ptolemy remained on the defensive, and at last a treaty was signed by which Ptolemy, heir of the Egyptian crown, and Berenice, heiress of Cyrenaica, were betrothed, Magas retaining the power if not the name of king. Philadelphus was also fortunate in recovering Phoenicia and Coele-Syria. This probably took place not much before b.c. 266, for that is the earliest date in the series of coins struck at Tyre during his reign. He secured the friendship of the Phoenician and Palestinian coast-towns, by granting them a degree of autonomy, for their coins, though dated in his reign, were struck at each town, and bear not his name but that of his father. In Egypt lie paid great attention to the extension of commerce. He reopened the canal of the Red Sea and established a desert route from Coptos to Berenice on the coast which he had founded. He made war in Ethiopia, but according to his custom he was content to be on friendly terms with the Ethiopian king Ergamenes. His Ethiopian expedition led to his establishing a station for the purpose of securing a supply of elephants for war. An ambassador was sent to India. Thus the trade of Ethiopia, Arabia, and India was secured for Egypt, and continued to enrich it for eighteen centuries. Not Jess wisely Philadelphus made Alexandria, with the Museum and Library, the heart of the learning of Greece. Many cities were founded by him, or like Ptolémaïs in Galilee, refounded. In his long reign there was little expenditure but such as was calculated to enrich his empire. At his death his dominions equalled those of his father. He held Cyprus, much of the coast of Asia Minor, the Cyclades, and part of Ethiopia and Arabia. The Cyrenaica was only to be separated for the life of Magas. He twice married. His second wife was Arsiuoë II., his full sister, whom he married in accordance with Egyptian rather than Greek notions. She was a woman of great beauty and force of character, and much loved by her husband. The character of Philadelphus is marked by the craft rather than the force of his father’s; but he inherited to the full his love of literature and his love of pleasure, both undisturbed by warlike ambition. He is the last representative of the old Greek “tyrannos,” whom Pindar has made known to us, rather than one of the restless “diadochoi.”

Ptolemy Euergetes, son of Philadelphus and Arsinoë I., by his accession, b.c. 247, reunited the Cyrenaica to the Egyptian empire. A quarrel between Egypt and Syria immediately broke out. The Syrian king Antiochus II. had married a daughter of Philadelphus. She was now put away, and, as well as Antiochus, murdered by her rival, his first wife Laodice, who set up her son Seleucus II. Ptolemy invaded Syria, which he speedily subdued, and then following the traditions of Egyptian conquest, he passed the Euphrates and reduced the whole of the eastern dominions of Seleucus. He returned to Egypt with vast treasures, including the statues of the gods which Cambyses had carried away, and which he restored to the temples. At sea he was equally fortunate, and the maritime territories of Egypt in the eastern Mediterranean were greatly enlarged. For a moment the old Egyptian Empire was again revived [9:7:746] in larger proportions, extending from the Thracian coast to Ethiopia, from Cyrene to the border of India. The eastern provinces speedily returned to the Syrian rule, and Ptolemy was content with a moderate accession of territory on that side. He, however, retained his Greek conquests and pushed far south in Abyssinia. Euergetes was not merely a warlike king. He cared for literature, and more than his predecessors laboured to please the Egyptians. He is the first Ptolemy whose Egyptian structures are worthy of the wealth of the country. Art had lost its ancient delicacy, yet the sumptuous architecture of this age merits admiration as showing a new though somewhat false development of the ancient style. His reform of the native calendar, as recorded in the Decree of Canopus, is another mark of his wise interest in Egypt. He was fortunate in his marriage with Berenice IL, who as queen of Cyrene is the first Egyptian queen who has the same regal style as her husband. Having reigned twenty-five years he left his kingdom to his son.

Ptolemy Philopator, who began to reign b.c. 222, immediately on his accession put his mother Berenice and others of his nearest kindred to death, and, leaving the management of the state to Sosibius, abandoned himself to luxury. Antiochus III., king of Syria, seized the opportunity to wrest from Egypt all the eastern provinces. Ptolemy at length took the field himself in defence of Egypt, and defeated Antiochus at Raphia, where his success was greatly due to the courage of Arsinoë III., his sister and wife (b.c. 217). By this victory Coele-Syria and Phoenicia were recovered. Ptolemy returned to his former life, and Arsinoë was put to death. He left his kingdom, greatly weakened by bad administration and growing disaffection, to a child, Ptolemy Epiphanes. The other two Macedonian kings, Philip V. and Antiochus III., now allied themselves to despoil Egypt of the provinces. Everything but Cyprus and Cyrene was taken, and the Egyptian ministers only saved the country by having called in the aid of Rome. The Republic had long been friendly to the Ptolemies, and nothing suited her policy better than a protectorate of Egypt. Accordingly M. Aemilius Lepidus was sont as regent to Alexandria, and Antiochus was commanded to restore what he had conquered. It was finally settled that Ptolemy should marry Cleopatra, daughter of the Syrian king, and that she should take back Coele-Syria and Phoenicia. From this time Rome ruled Egypt with reference to her own eastern policy. The kingdom of the Ptolemies was not allowed to fall, but it was kept within the most moderate limits. Consequently the weak kings were supported and the strong kings thwarted in every way. Egypt could not rid herself of a bad ruler or enjoy the full advantage of a good one. The rest of the minority of Ptolemy was marked by a serious revolt in Lower Egypt, put down with great difficulty. In b.c. 196, when but thirteen or fourteen years old, the young king was crowned at Memphis, when the decree of the Rosetta Stone was issued. The place of coronation and the terms of the decree show a policy of conciliation towards the Egyptians which the revolt probably rendered especially necessary. The marriage of Ptolemy and Cleopatra I. took place b.c. 193-2, but the dowry was not handed over. Ptolemy continued true to the Romans in their war with Antiochus, but was not allowed to act as their ally, and gained nothing in the subsequent treaty. Another revolt broke out in Lower Egypt, and was cruelly suppressed, b.c. 185. Ptolemy perished by poison in B.c. 181, leaving two sons surnamed Philometor and Euergetes, who ruled Egypt in succession. Epiphanes inherited the weakness and cruelty of his father, and with him Egypt lost for a time her influence in the affairs of the world.

Cleopatra I., who like Berenice II. was queen as heiress, now became regent for Ptolemy Philometor, and ruled well until her death, about b.c. 174. The ministers then made war on Antiochus IV. (Epiphanes) for the disputed provinces. The Egyptian forces were defeated, Egypt invaded, and Ptolemy seized (b.c. 170). His younger brother, Euergetes IL, with an audacious courage that marks his whole career, declared himself king at Alexandria, where Antiochus besieged him in vain, and Roman ambassadors interfered for his protection. Antiochus retired, leaving Philometor as king at Memphis. The two brothers now made terms, agreeing to a joint rule. Antiochus again invaded Egypt, and inarched to Alexandria, but was forced to retire by the resolution of a Roman ambassador, M. Popillius Laenas (b.c. 168). From this time Egypt was more than ever in the hands of the Romans, and in consequence of the manner in which Philometor had yielded to Antiochus while Euergetes had resisted his pretensions and depended on their support, we find them constantly aiding Euergetes, whose abilities, if equal to those of Philometor, were weighted by a perfidious and cruel disposition. It was not long before Euergetes succeeded in driving Philometor from Alexandria. The fugitive went to Rome B.c. 164, and the senate agreed to reinstate him. Euergetes was spared by his brother, and the Roman deputies obtained for him the kingdom of Cyrene, where he occupied himself in ceaseless plots to obtain Cyprus, assisted by the active support of Demetrius I. of Syria and the unjust diplomatic aid of the Roman senate. Philometor had the courage to oppose his brother, who invaded Cyprus with Roman ambassadors ordered to settle him in the government of the island. Philometor defeated and took him prisoner, but again spared his life, and left him the kingdom of Cyrene (b.c. 154). The Romans did not interfere with this settlement.

The part Demetrius I. had played in the war in Cyprus led Philometor to take the side of the usurper Alexander I. (Balas), to whom he gave his daughter Cleopatra to wife (b.c. 150). When Demetrius II. endeavoured to recover his father’s kingdom Ptolemy advanced to the support of Alexander, but thinking him treacherous, he turned his arms to the aid of the legitimate king. Rapidly subduing the country, Ptolemy entered Antioch and was hailed king of Syria, to the crown of which he had a claim as descended maternally from the Seleucid line; but he admitted the higher right of Demetrius, whom he aided in resisting an invasion by Alexander. In a decisive victory Ptolemy was thrown by his horse and mortally injured (b.c. 146).

It was in the reign of Philometor that Onias founded the temple at Onion in Egypt, which tended to increase the importance of the Jewish colonies and to separate the Alexandrian from the Palestinian school.

With this king the power of Egypt finally fell. He was the last Ptolemy who had the capacity to rule amidst the growing difficulties of the time. In his wars he showed courage and generalship, in his dealings with Rome caution and decision, in his rejection of the Seleucid diadem moderation and justice, in his treatment of his brother and his subjects an extraordinary clemency and humanity.

Cleopatra IL, the sister and widow of Philometor, put their son on the throne.^[52. There is difficulty as to his name. In Egyptian documents Eupator precedes or follows Philometor (Lepsius, Berl. Akad. 1852, 464, serø.); but in a Greek inscription in Cyprus the later place is stated (Hogg, J., “Inscrs. from Cyprus,” R. S. Lit., 2 ser., vii. 387, seqq.).] Euergetes at once marched from Cyrene to Alexandria. The Romans as usual took his part, and stopped the war on the condition that Euergetes should marry his brother’s widow. r Γhe young king was instantly put to death. Ptolemy reigned as he had begun: Alexandria was depopulated by his cruelties, though the rest of Egypt seems to have fared better in consequence of his want of ambition. He divorced Cleopatra II. to [9:7:747] marry her daughter, his niece, Cleopatra III. In B.c. 130 he was driven out of Egypt by a revolt, and Cleopatra II. became queen. In revenge he put to death their son. Cleopatra having asked the aid of Demetrius IL, Ptolemy was recalled, b.c. 127, and for the rest of his reign adopted a more conciliatory policy. He engaged in war against Demetrius IL, and supported the usurper Alexander IL, against whom he subsequently turned, apparently with reason. The reconciliation with the Seleucids led to the recall of Cleopatra IL, with whom Ptolemy now reigned. He died B.c. 117, in the fifty-fourth year from his first accession. This king, the worst of the Ptolemies, as Philometor was the best, is significantly known by the nickname Physcon, or Fat-paunch, but he was also called by his subjects the Ill-doer, Kakergetes, instead of the Welldoer, Euergetes. Some of his latest coins present, instead of the idealized head of Ptolemy, the founder of the line, bloated and cruel features which can only be those of Physcon. His one good quality was a hereditary love of letters.

Cleopatra III., surnamed Cocce, widow of Euergetes and heiress of Philometor, succeeded, and, in deference to the popular will of the Alexandrians, associated with her Ptolemy Soter IL, surnamed Lathyrus, or Lathurus, her elder son, instead of Ptolemy Alexander I., the younger, whom she preferred. They ruled together with little concord, and at length Cleopatra expelled her colleague, who had been the real sovereign, and recalled Alexander from Cyprus, where he had already ruled independently for seven years (b.c. 107). Cyrene was probably lost to Egypt about this time. Physcon had left this kingdom to his base son Ptolemy Apion, w ho is generally supposed to have at once succeeded. The coins, however, show that the latest Cyrenalc coinage of Physcon was continued by Lathyrus. Cleopatra III. now ruled with a stronger authority, but by degrees Alexander gained the upper hand, and ultimately dissensions arose which ended by his causing her death (b.c. 89): this occasioned troubles which lost him his throne, and brought about the recall of his brother (b.c. 89). During the interval Lathyrus had ruled i∩ Cyprus, and both brothers had engaged on opposite sides in the wars of the Seleucid princes. As king of Egypt, Lathyrus had to subdue a native revolt, the first we know to have happened in Upper Egypt in the time of the Ptolemies. Thebes seems to have been its centre, and here the insurgents stood a siege of nearly three years, when the city was taken and reduced to the ruined state from which it has never since risen. Lathyrus died in b.c. 81. He appears to have been weak and cruel, with some qualities as a politician and general. He left one legitimate child, a daughter, Berenice III., who succeeded him. Her step-son, Alexander IL, son of Alexander I., came from Rome as Sulla’s candidate, and married her. The nuptials were almost immediately followed by the murder of the queen by her husband’s order, and his deserved death in a popular tumult which was thus excited (b.c. 80). In default of legitimate issue, two base sons of Lathyrus now shared the Egyptian dominions, the elder, Ptolemy Neus Dionysus, surnamed Auletes, the Flute-player, taking Egypt, and bis younger brother Ptolemy acquiring Cyprus. Auletes inherited the vices without the ability of Physcon, and having spent great sums in obtaining the recognition of the senate, who probably would not readily part with the claim based on the legacy which either Alexander I. or II. had made of his kingdom to the Romans, he wearied the patience of his subjects by heavy taxation, and was expelled by the Alexandrians b.c. 58. His wife Cleopatra V. and daughter Berenice IV. now reigned together, but, on the death of the elder, the younger became sole queen. Berenice was twice married, first to Seleucus, a pretended Seleucid, whom she put to death, and then to Archelaus. With the support of Gabinius, proconsul of Syria, Auletes at length recovered Egypt, B.c. 55. He punished his daughter with death, and in b.c. 51 his troubled reign came to an end. At this time his family consisted of two sons and two daughters,—the famous Cleopatra and Arsinoë, all of whom in turn exercised regal power, three in Egypt.

Ptolemy, the elder son of Auletes, and Cleopatra VI., his elder daughter, succeeded in accordance with their father’s will, which the Roman senate ratified. In B.c. 48 her brother expelled Cleopatra, who fled into Syria. Advancing to conquer Egypt by force of arms, she was met by her brother’s forces near Pelusium. Here it was that Pompey, after the ruin of his cause, was assassinated by order of Ptolemy’s ministers as he sought the king’s protection. Caesar, following Pompey, reached Alexandria, Here Cleopatra, giving up her ideas of war, made her way to Caesar and secured his interest. After a struggle with the Egyptian ministers, who almost succeeded in overpowering Caesar’s small forces, and who ultimately had the support of young Ptolemy, who escaped from the Romans, the Egyptians were defeated and the king drowned (b.c. 47). Cleopatra now became queen, associated with a phantom king, the younger Ptolemy. In B.c. 45 she went to Rome with her brother and young Ptolemy Caesar, her son by the dictator, wishing to be acknowledged Caesar’s wife, and that the boy should be made his heir. Next year Caesar was murdered, but by his will his nephew Octavius became his heir, Cleopatra’s son, his only surviving child, being necessarily set aside. The queen determined to secure for her sen Egypt at least, and made away with her unfortunate brother. She nextappears when, after the battle of Philippi, the triumvir Antony made his progress through Asia Minor. It was necessary that the queen of Egypt should conciliate the ruler of the Eastern world. Cleopatra resolved to govern him. As Caesar seven years before, Antony now was instantly captivated by the Egyptian queen. She was past thirty, but if her beauty had waned her wit had grown. Her portrait on her coins is that of a woman of intellect and charm, not of beauty. A broad head with wavy hair, an aquiline nose, large deep-set eyes, and a full eloquent mouth, is supported by a long slender throat. To these personal qualities she added a mind singularly cultivated, ready discourse in several languages, and, what that so often lacks, as ready wit. She took Antony to Alexandria and governed the East for him. While her power waxed his waned. Asia Minor was overrun by Q. Labienus at the head of a Parthian army, and Palestine and Phoenicia by another led by Pacorus, the Parthian king’s son. In Italy Antony’s adherents were routed. He now resolved to attack Italy itself, and a great war was only averted by the armies, which forced the generals to conclude a peace (b.c. 40). Octavia, his rival’s sister, was given in marriage to Antony, and for three years Cleopatra lost her power. In b.c. 36 Antony deserted Octavia and returned to Alexandria and the Egyptian queen. With the exception of an unsuccessful Parthian campaign and an inglorious Armenian one, Antony effected nothing. He was amused by the luxurious life of Alexandria; and, while Cleopatra maintained her Egyptian rights and ruled with Ptolemy Caesar, she shared Antony’s government of the East, appearing as queen with him as triumvir upon the coins of Antioch. In b.c. 32 Octavian declared war against Cleopatra, and Antony took his revenge by divorcing Octavia. Then followed the conflict in the Adriatic for the world’s empire, in which Antony’s old military skill failed him, and Cleopatra, leaving the battle, perhaps through a woman’s fear, drew him away also (b.c. 31). Arrived at Alexandria, Cleopatra showed more energy than Antony, and, when Octavian reached [9:7:748] Egypt, more policy. Antony, on the false news of the queen’s death, stabbed himself; and Cleopatra, finding Octavian resolved to make her walk in his triumph, perished by her own hands in some unknown way. Thus Egypt became a Roman province, b.c. 30. The young Ptolemy Caesar, in spite of his double claim, perished by the command of Octavian, but the beautiful Cleopatra, Antony’s daughter by the queen, was generously taken by his divorced wife Octavia, brought up with her own children, and married to a king, Juba II. of Mauretania. With their son Ptolemy, whom Caligula put to death a.d. 40, this great line came to an end. Its genius ended with Cleopatra. The dislike of the Romans for her has tended to give the moderns too low an estimate of her abilities. When we see what Egypt was under Auletes and under her we are astonished to perceive how much she accomplished by her management of Caesar and of Antony. After all the other independent states had been absorbed by Rome, Egypt was raised from a mere protected province to be once more a kingdom, and at last Alexandria became again a seat of empire. But the task Cleopatra set herself was beyond accomplishment; the more she turned Antony into an imperial ruler the less could he control the Roman armies by which he governed. Thus the fabric she had raised was rotten at the base, and with her fall it disappeared.

The history of Egypt under the Homans being that of a province, and the most interesting events matters of ecclesiastical history, may here be told very briefly. Worn out by the cruelty and avarice of a succession of bad rulers, the country must have welcomed the Romans almost as it had welcomed Alexander, and so soon as it was known that the native religion would be protected, all discontent must have vanished. The temples were still the care of the nιlers. Art had indeed fallen very low, yet it continued to produce buildings with a certain rich grandeur, that did not begin to give place to Graeco-Roman structures till the time of Hadrian and the Antonines.

Aelius Gallus, prefect of Egypt under Augustus, was ambitious to enlarge the province by foreign conquest. He failed in an expedition into Arabia Felix, but repelled an Ethiopian invasion, and in return penetrated as far as Napata, the capital of Queen Candace, which he captured. In later reigns the chief events were troubles connected with the Jewish population. In the time of Vespasian, the temple Onias had founded was closed, and a great J ewish revolt in the reign of Trajan, which was not easily suppressed, cost the Jews the privileges which, in common with the Greek population, they had enjoyed above the native inhabitants. Hadrian twice visited Egypt (a.d. 130,134). He renewed the old privileges and granted new ones. The foundation of Antinoë shows how low the nation had then fallen. Under Antoninus Pius, a Sothiac Cycle began (a.d. 139). In the next reign, Avidius Cassius, prefect of Egypt, having suppressed a serious revolt, usurped the purple, and was acknowledged by the armies of Syria and Egypt. On the approach of Marcus Aurelius, the adherents of Cassius slew him, and the clemency of the emperor restored peace. After the downfall of the house of the Antonines, Pescennius Niger, who commanded the forces in Egypt, was proclaimed emperor on the death of Pertinax (a.d. 193). Severus overthrew his rival (a.d. 194), and, the revolt having been a military one, did not punish the province, but gave great privileges to the Alexandrians. In his reign the Christians of Egypt suffered the first of their many persecutions. λVhen Christianity was planted in the country we do not know, but it must very early have gained adherents among the learned Jews of Alexandria, whose school of thought was in some respects ready to welcome it. From them it rapidly passed to the Greeks. Ultimately, the new religion spread to the Egyptians; their own creed was worn out, and they found in Christianity a doctrine of the future life, for which their old belief had made them not unready; while the social teaching of Christianity came with special fitness to a subject race. The history of the Coptic Version has yet to be written. It presents some features of great antiquity, and, unlike all others, has the truly popular character of being written in the three dialects of the language. Side by side there grew up an Alexandrian Church, philosophic, disputative, ambitious, the very centre of Christian learning, and an Egyptian Church, ascetic, contemplative, mystical. The two at length influenced one another; still we can generally trace the philosophic teachers to a Greek origin, the mystics to an Egyptian.

Caracalla, in revenge for an affront, massacred the population of Alexandria. Under Decius the Christians again sufΓered from persecution. When the Empire broke up in the weak reign of Gallienus, Aemilianus was made emperor by the troops at Alexandria; but, after a short and vigorous reign, was conquered by the forces of Gallienus. Zenobia, queen of Palmyra, after an unsuccessful invasion, on a second attempt conquered Egypt, which she added to her empire, but lost it when Aurelian made war upon her (a.d. 272). The province was, however, unsettled, and the conquest of Palmyra was followed in the same year by the suppression of a revolt in Egypt (a. d. 273). Probus, who“had governed Egypt for Aurelian and Tacitus, was subsequently chosen by the troops to succeed Tacitus, and is the first governor of this province who obtained the whole of the Empire. The country, however, was still disturbed, ändernder the reign of Diocletian, in a.d. 292, a formidable revolt had broken out, led by Achilleus, who as emperor took the name Domitius Domitianus. Diocletian, finding his troops unable to determine the struggle, came to Egypt and reduced the strongholds of the country. After he had left, Domitianus again raised his standard and captured Alexandria, but Diocletian returning to Egypt took the city and put his rival to death (a.d. 297). This revolt has very distinctly the character of a native rising, for it was not localized in Alexandria, but spread over the country.

The reign of Diocletian is the turning-point in the history of the Egyptian Church. The edict of a.d. 303 against the Christians, and those which succeeded it, were rigorously carried out in Egypt, where Paganism was still strong, and face to face with a strong and united church. Galerius, who succeeded Diocletian in the government of the East, implacably pursued his policy, and this great persecution did not end until the persecutor, perishing, it is said, of the dire malady of Herod and Philip II. of Spain, sent out an edict of toleration (a.d. 311). The Copts date from the accession of Diocletian (a.u. 284), which they call the Era of Diocletian or of the Martyrs.

By the Edict of Milan (a.d. 313), Constantine, with the agreement of his colleague Licinius, acknowledged Christianity as having at least equal rights with other religions, and when he gained sole power he wrote to all his subjects advising them, like him, to become Christians (a.d. 324). The Egyptian Church, hitherto free from schism, was now divided by a fierce controversy, in which we see two Greek parties, rather than a Greek and an Egyptian, in conflict. The Council of Nicaea was called together (A.υ. 325) to determine between the orthodox and the party of the Alexandrian presbyter Arius. At that council the native Egyptian bishops were chiefly remarkable for their manly protest against enforcing celibacy on the clergy. The most conspicuous controversialist on the orthodox side was the young Alexandrian deacon, Athanasius, who returned home to be made archbishop of Alexandria (a.d. 326). For the long period during which he presided over the Church of Egypt, his history is that of the struggle of the two parties. Four times expelled by the Arians, and once by the emperor Julian, he employed each banishment for work in the cause to which he was devoted, and on each restoration he used his success with a moderation in marked contrast to the persecuting policy of his enemies. His name and person were at last known to the whole empire, which unconsciously recognized in him an ecclesiastical ruler of Christendom, rather than the chief prelate of a province. He was more a man of action than of thought, more an administrator than a student, but his intrepid patience, his moderation, and his indomitable energy, all directed to the welfare of the church and to no personal ends, gave him an influence never afterwards obtained without the support of avast ecclesiastical machinery. His is the latest character which was formed upon the model of St Paul’s, and the most remarkable of his age. He died a.d. 373, at the momentwhenan Arian persecution began. The reign of Theodosius I. witnessed the overthrow of Arianism, which was followed by the suppression of Paganism, against which a final ediet was promulgated A.D. 390. In Egypt, the year before, the temple of Sarapis at Alexandria had been destroyed, and to the same period we must assign the beginning of a partial destruction of those Egyptian temples which had escaped the Persian conquerors. Generally the Coptic Christians were content to build their churches within the ancient temples, plastering over or effacing the sculptures which were nearest to the ground and in the way of the worshippers. They do not seem to have been very zealous in the work of destruction. The native religion was already dead and they had no fear of it. The prosperity of the church was the sign of its decay, and before long we find persecution and injustice disgracing the scat of Athanasius. Cyril the patriarch of Alexandria expelled the Jews from the capital with the aid of the mob, and by the murder of the beautiful philosopher Hypatia marked the lowest depth to which ignorant fanaticism could descend. A schism now produced lengthened βivil war, and alienated Egypt from the empire. The Monophysites, after a struggle of two centuries and a half, became utterly hostile to the Greek rule. It was in these circumstances that a country which, remote from the great conflicts that destroyed the Western Empire and threatened the existence of the Eastern, had enjoyed uninterrupted freedom from an invader since its conquest by Zenobia, and had known no rebellion since that of Achilleus, fell without a [9:7:749] [9:7:750] him publicly as a traitor from the pulpits throughout his dominions. Yet that he secretly favoured him is proved by his vain attempt to escape to Egypt from the tyranny of his warlike brother. Ahmad founded the dynasty of the Benee-Tooloon, which lasted for a period of 37 years. He built the royal city of El-Katâë', between El- ’ Askar and Mount Mukattam, enriched it with splendid buildings, and constituted it the seat of his government. Its site is now covered with ruins, only his great mosque remaining a proud example of his wealth and magnificence, still the largest mosque of Cairo, and, as presenting the earliest specimens of the pointed arch, noteworthy in the history of architecture. The reign of this vigorous and wise prince was remarkable for prosperity at home and conquests abroad. He took Barkah, and in Syria in 264 captured Damascus, Hims (Emessa), Hamah, and Aleppo; after which he proceeded to Antioch, and the governor refusing to surrender, he took that city by storm. He then advanced towards Tarsus, but his supplies failing he was compelled to retire. About five years later, Lu-lu, his deputy and governor of Aleppo and other towns in Syria and in Mesopotamia, revolted and entered into a league with El-Muwaffik. It was apparently after an expedition against this rebel that Ahmad died, in the year 270 (a.d. 884). During the latter years of his reign, he had abandoned that simplicity of life which had distinguished his youth, and had given himself up to boundless luxury. At his death, there was found in his treasury ten millions of deenars, and his establishment was discovered to consist of 7000 mounted memiooks, 300 picked horses for his own use, a body-guard of 24,000 slaves, besides 6000 asses and mules, 10,000 camels, and 100 wherries. By what oppression the revenue necessary to maintain such a household was raised some idea may be formed, when it is stated that at the time of his death 18,000 persons were confined in Ibn-Tooloon’s prisons.

Khumâraweyh, on the death of his father, was appointed his successor by the army, he being then twenty years old, and he inherited a kingdom extending from the Euphrates to Nubia. He fought a battle with the forces of the caliph, commanded by a son of El-Muwafhk (afterwards the caliph El-Moatadid), between Damascus and Ramleh; in which his army gained the victory, although he himself, never having seen a battle before, fled the scene of action in a panic, drawing a large part of his troops after him. But he soon reversed the independent policy of his father, and making peace with the caliph in 273 he not only put the latter’s name with that of his brother El-Muwaffik in the public prayers, but entirely omitted his own; though it must be allowed he did not pursue the same servile course in his coinage. On the accession of El-Moatadid in 279, Khumâraweyh continued his conciliatory policy and offered his daughter Katr-en-Nedà (Dewdrops) in marriage to the caliph’s son. In 282 he made an incursion into the Greek territory, and died at Damascus. It is said that he was fearful of assassination; to avoid which he had trained a lion to guard him while he slept on his bed of quicksilver. His fears were justified; for he was put to death by his women, or according to some by his eunuchs.

His eldest son, Geysh Abu-1-’Asâkir, not yet fourteen years old, succeeded him. This prince was killed in less than eight months: his youth, which rendered him unfit to govern, occasioned his fall; for he had discarded from his society those who were in favour with his father, and associated with none but worthless men. He was succeeded in 283 by his brother Haroon, the principal events of whose rule were a great tempest and earthquake in Egypt in 286, and a treaty which he concluded with the caliph, by which the provinces of Awâsim and Kinnesreen were ceded to him and the annual tribute from Egypt was fixed at 450,000 deenars. He reigned upwards of eight years, but gave himself up to pleasure, and, as some say, was put to death in 292 by his uncles Sbeyban and Àdee, sons of the founder of the dynasty, the former of whom succeeded to the government. In the meantime, at the instigation of the generals of Hâroon, Mohammad Ibn-Suleymân, a scribe of Lu-lu, advanced against Egypt with a numerous and heavily equipped army. Sheybân went forth to meet him with all the forces he could muster, but numbers of his troops deserted to the invader, and he was soon compelled to surrender. Mohammad Ibn-Suleymân burned El-Katâë’, and sacked El-Fustât, reducing the women to slavery, committing many atrocities, and exiling the family of Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon, with all their adherents (a.h. 292, A. D. 905).

Having thus completed his conquest, and restored the province of Egypt to the house of ’Abbâs, Ibn-Suleymân yielded the government to ’ Eesa En-N6sharee, appointed by El-Muktefee. He died in 297, and was followed by Tekeen El-Gezeree, under whose rule Egypt was invaded by the forces of Obeyd-Allah El-Mahdee, first prince of the dynasty of the Fâtimees, which had succeeded the Benee-l-Aghlab in the dominion of Northern Africa. His general Hubâsheh, having taken Barkah, advanced (in 302), with an army of 100,000 men, to Alexandria, which he found deserted, and thence marched to the Feiyoom, where Tekeen, reinforced with troops from El-Irâk, gave battle, and defeated the enemy in a sanguinary conflict. In the following year, he was succeeded by Abu-l-Hasan Zekee Kr·Roomee, in whose time El-Mahdee again attempted the conquest of Egypt with an army under the command of his son, Abu-1- Kâsim; Alexandria fell into his hands in 307; its inhabitants fled, and Zekee entrenched himself in El-Geezeh, on the western bank of the Nile, and shortly afterwards died. In this emergency Tekeen was reinstated in his office; and a fleet of twenty-five sail was sent from Tarsus by the caliph, which meeting with the flotilla of the enemy off Resheed almost annihilated it. Tekeen, meanwhile, had defeated the Africans, but without decisive effect. At length, being twice reinforced from Baghdad, he drove Abu-Kâsim back to Barkah. After rendering this important service Tekeen was again recalled. Three other governors were then successively appointed; but the troops revolting, and much sedition and rapine ensuing, Tekeen was once more despatched to Egypt, where he remained until his death in the year 321 (a.d. 933).

He was followed by Aboo-bekr Mohammad El-Ikhsheed lbn-Ta-ghag, afterwards the founder of the dynasty of the Ikhsheedees, who was almost immediately superseded by another governor; and for one year more Egypt continued to be a province of the caliphs of Baghdâd. In the year 323, El-lkhsheed again succeeded to the government. About this time little remained to the caliph of his once broad empire beyond the province of Baghdâd, and even there his power was but nominal. Khurasân, Fars, Kannan, Rei, Ispahân, Mosul, and the provinces of Mesopotamia, were either in a state of revolt, or nearly or wholly lost to him. Spain was governed by the Dynasty of Umeiyeh, and Africa by that of El-Mahdee; and we have seen the distracted state of Egypt since the fall of the Benee-Tooloon. El-Ikhsheed availed himself of these circumstances to make himself the independent sovereign of Egypt and Syria, continuing, however, to acknowledge the spiritual supremacy of the caliph. Shortly after, he defeated the forces of El-Mahdee, who had again made an inroad into the country: and in 327 he was decorated by Er-Râdee with the title of El-Ikhsheed, a name borne by the rulers of the province of Ferghâneh in Transoxania, from whom he was descended. In the following year Ibn-Râïk subdued a great part of Syria, and having taken Damascus advanced to the frontier of Egypt, where after a very severe engagement he was utterly routed and pursued by the troops of El-Ikhsheed as far as Damascus. There, however, the fortune of war turned against El-lkhsheed, and for a time he was deprived of the province of Syria, though he subsequently regained possession of it. During his reign, the caliphs of Baghdâd were daily losing power, and in the year 333, El-Muktefee wrote to him lamenting his miserable state; whereupon El-Ikhsheed immediately repaired to him at Rakkah with valuable presents and offered him assistance and an asylum in Egypt, of which the caliph was too timid to avail himself. About this time, also, he conducted a war with various success against Seyf-ed-Dowleh the Hamdânee, who had attacked Syria. He died at Damascus in 334 (A.D. 946), in the 66th year of his age, and was buried, as were his sons, in the mosque of Omar at Jerusalem.

Of El-lkhsheed’s two sons and successors, Abu-1-Kâsim Oongoor (who died in 349), and Abu-l-Hasan ’Alee, little is known, their vizir Kâfoor, a black eunuch, being the actual ruler. In the reign of the former, in the year 343, a great fire occurred in El-Fustât, which destroyed 1700 houses and much merchandise. Kâfoor succeeded to the throne in 355, and was acknowledged throughout Egypt, Syria, and the Higâz. He ruled with great ability, and was a patron of literature; his name is celebrated by the poet El-Mutanebbee, who was his boon-companion, and whom, as well as other learned men, he rewarded with magnificent presents. On his death in 357, internal dissensions respecting the succession of Abu-1-Fuwâris, a son of ’Alee, presented a favourable opportunity to the Fâtimee caliph to renew the often-repeated invasions of Egypt.

Hitherto, with few exceptions, the most notable of which are the reigns of Ibn-Tooloon, Khumâraweyh, El-Ikhsheed, and Kâfoor, the Muslim rulers of Egypt had not much benefited the country, or rescued it from the anarchy and troubles in which it had become involved under the Lower Empire. But the incidents of the time are so little known that they have been deemed worthy of more mention in this article than perhaps their importance would otherwise warrant. From the period at which we have now arrived, however, the annals of Egypt contain much important matter, and are so closely interwoven with the events of the Crusades as to lender them deeply interesting to the student of European history. The rise of the schismatic caliphs of Africa is a remarkable episode in the early days of El-Islâm, and most of the princes of that dynasty were not unworthy of their successors, the renowned Saladin and his family, and the Memlook sultans.

In the year 358 (a.d. 969) El-Mo'izz li-deeni-llâh, the fouτth Fâtimee caliph, equipped a large and well-aimed force, with a formidable body of cavalry, the whole under the command of Abu- 1-Hoseyn Gohar el-Kâïd, a native of Greece, and a slave of Lis father El-Mansoor. This general, on his aιτival near Alexandria, received a deputation from the inhabitants of El-Fustât, charged to negotiate a treaty. Their overtures were favourably entertained, and the conquest of the country seemed probable without bloodshed.
[9:7:751]

But, while the conditions were being ratified, the Ikhsheedees prevailed on the people to revoke their offer, and the ambassadors on their return were themselves compelled to seek safety in flight. Gohar lost no time in pushing forward. Before El-Geezeh a partial combat took place; several days were passed in skirmishes, and at length he forced the passage of the Nile a few miles south of that town, at the head of his troops. Here the Ikhsheedees offered a brave resistance; the greater part were left dead on the field, and the remainder, taking what valuables they could carry off, fled from El-Fustât. The former mediators were now brought to intercede for the inhabitants and the women of the fallen dynasty, and to the honour of the African general it is related that they were pardoned and the city was peaceably occupied. The submission of the rest of Egypt was secured by this victory; and all the Higâz, including the holy cities, and the Yemen, speedily acknowledged the authority of the Fâtimee El-Mo’izz. In the year 359 Syria was also added to his dominions, but shortly after was overrun by the Karmatees (Carmathians), the troops of El-Mo’izz met with several reverses, Damascus was taken, and those lawless freebooters, joined by the Ikhsheedees, advanced to ’Eyn-Shems. In the meanwhile, Gohar had fortified EI-Kahireh,^[53. The modern Cairo was originally called El-Mansooreeyeh; El-Mo’izz, however, changed its name to that of El-Kihireh, by reason of an omen at its foundation. For details respecting this and the other capitals of Egypt under the Muslims, see the sketch in the Englishwoman in Egypt, vol. i. 124, seqq. in which the author has availed herself of the valuable MS. notes of Mr Lane.] or Cairo (the new capital which he had founded immediately north of El-Fustât), and taken every precaution to repel the invaders; a bloody battie was fought on Friday, the 1st of Rabeea el-0wwal, in the year 361, before the city walls, without any decisive result. On the following Sunday, however, Gohar obtained a great victory over the enemy, who experienced a reverse more complete than any before suffered, and the camp and baggage fell into the hands of the conqueror.

At the earnest solicitations of his lieutenant, who had ruled Egypt both ably and justly, with almost absolute authority, ElMo’izz at length determined to remove his court to his new kingdom. In Ramadan 362, he entered El-Kalιireh, bringing with him the bodies of his three predecessors and vast treasure. ElMo’izz reigned about two years in Egypt, dying in the year 365. He is described as a warlike and ambitious prince, but, notwithstanding, he was especially distinguished for justice and was fond of learning. He showed great favour to the Christians, especially to Severus, bishop of El-Ashmooneyιι, and the patriarch Ephrem; and under his orders, and with his assistance, the church of the Mu’allakah, in Old Misr, was rebuilt. He executed many useful works, (among others rendering navigable the Tanitic branch of the Nile, which is still called the canal of El-Mo’izz), and occupied himself in embellishing El-Kâhireh. Gohar, when he founded that city built the great mosque named El-Azhar, the university of Egypt, which to this day is crowded with students from all parts of the Muslim world. The principal event of his reign in Egypt was the second irruption of Hasan the Karmatee. The enemy, as on the former occasion, reached ’Eyn-Shems; but now he gained more advantage over the African troops. Although he was twice defeated in different parts of Egypt, and constantly harassed in his advance, the capital was closely besieged by him, and its defenders were driven across the fosse. Thus straitened, El-Mo’izz had recourse to stratagem, and succeeded in bribing Hasan Ibn-El-Garrâh (who, with a body of the tribe of Tei, fought with the Karmatees) to desert them in the heat of the next battle. The result of this plan was successful, and again Hasan was defeated and compelled to flee. This event, which occurred in the year 363, relieved Egypt of another invader, an ally of Hasan, byname Abd-Allah Ibn-’Obeyd-Allah (formerly governor of Syria under Kafoor), and obtained for the arms of El-Mo’izz various successes in Syria.

El-’Azeez Aboo-Mansoor Nizâr, on coming to the throne of his father, immediately despatched an expedition against the Turkish chief El-Eftekeen, who had taken Damascus a short time previously. Gohar again commanded the army, and pressed the siege of that city so vigorously that the enemy called to their aid the Karmatees. Before this united army he retired by little and little to Ascalon, where he prepared to stand a siege; but being reduced to great straits, he purchased his liberty with a large sum of money. On his return from this disastrous campaign, El-’Azeez took the command in person, and meeting the enemy at Ramleh, was victorious after a bloody battle; while El-Eftekeen, being betrayed into his hands, was with Arab magnanimity received with honour and confidence, and ended his days in Egypt in affluence. El-’Azeez followed his father’s example of liberality. It is even said that he appointed a Jew his vizir in Syria, and a Christian to the same post in Egypt. These acts, however, nearly cost him his life, and a popular tumult obliged him to disgrace both these officers. After a reign of twenty-one years of great internal prosperity he died (a.h. 386) in a bath at Bilbeys, while preparing an expedition against the Greeks who were ravaging his possessions in Syria.

El-’Azeez was distinguished for moderation and mildness, but his son and successor rendered himself notorious for very opposite qualities. El-Hakim bi-amri-llâh Aboo-’Alee Mansoor began his reign, according to Muslim historians, with much wisdom, but afterwards acquired a character for impiety, cruelty, and unreasoning extravagance, by which he has been rendered odious to posterity. He is described as possessing at once “courage and boldness and cowardice and timorousness, a love for learning and vindictiveness towards the learned, an inclination to righteousness and a disposition to slay the righteous ;” and this character is fully borne out by his many extravagances. Of his cruelty numerous anecdotes are told us, especially in the discharge of his functions as Mohtesib, or “regulator of the markets and of the weights and measures,” an office which he assumed, and in wlrich he became the terror of the inhabitants. But his cruelty was surpassed by his impiety. He arrogated to himself divinity, and commanded his subjects to rise at the mention of his name in the congregational prayers, an edict which was obeyed even in the holy cities, Mecca and Medinah. He is most famous in connection with the Druses, a sect which he founded and which still holds him in veneration and believes in his future return to the earth. He had made himself obnoxious to all classes of his subjects, when, in the year 397, he nearly lost his throne by foreign invasion. Hishâm, surnamed Aboo-Rekweh, a descendant of the house of Umeiyeh in Spain, took the province of Barkah with a considerable force and subdued Upper Egypt. The caliph, aware of his danger, immediately collected his troops from every quarter of the kingdom, and marched against the invader, whom, after severe fighting, he defeated and put to flight. Hishâm himself was taken prisoner, paraded in Cairo with every aggravation of cruelty, and put to death. El-Hakim having thus by vigorous measures averted this danger, Egypt continued to groan under his tyranny until the year 411, when he fell by domestic treachery. His sister Seyyidet-el-Mulook had, in common with the rest of his subjects, incurred his displeasure; and being fearful for her life, she secretly and by night concerted measures with the emeer Seyf-ed-Dowleh, chief of the guard, who very readily agreed to her plans. Ten slaves, bribed by 500 deenârs each, having received their instructions, went forth on the appointed day to the desert tract southward of Cairo, where El-Hakim, unattended, was in the habit of riding, and waylaid him near the village of Hulwân, where they put him to death.

He was succeeded by his son, Edh-Dhahir (commonly pronounced Ez-Zâhir) bi-llâh Abu-l-Hasan ’Alee, who ruled with justice and moderation for nearly sixteen years. In 414 Aleppo was taken by Salih Ibn-Mardas; and although he was defeated and slain by an Egyptian force sent against him, a son, Shibl-ed-Dowleh, yet retained possession of that city. At this time also Hasan, of the tribe of Tei, before mentioned, had made himself master of Ramleh; and indeed from this caliph’s reign we may date the decline of the Fatimee power, especially in Syria.

In the year 427, El-Mustansir bi-llah Aboo-Temeem Ma’add came to the throne at the age of seven years. His reign occupied a long period, rendered remarkable by the unparalleled troubles which befell Egypt. It commenced prosperously with the defeat and death of Shibl-ed-Dowleh. Aleppo was taken, and the submission of the rest of Syria followed; and the general who had conducted the expedition against that province assumed its government. On his death, Mo’izz-ed-Dowleli, a brother of Shibl-ed-Dowleh, retook Aleppo in 433; but the various fortunes of this prince and his nephew Mahmood, from this time and during the calamities of Egypt, are too complicated and subordinate to claim a place here. In the western provinces, the rebel El-Mo’izz (the third successor of Yoosuf Ibn-Zeyree, who was appointed governor on the conquest of Egypt), was punished by an irruption of wild Arab tribes in the pay of El-Mustansir.

In the year 450 (a.i>. 1058), the Fatimee caliph was publicly prayed for in Baghdad,—a remarkable event, of which the immediate cause was briefly as follows. El-Besâseeree, a powerful Turkish chief exercising unbounded authority in that city, had fallen into disgrace, and received supplies of men and money from the caliph of Egypt; and while the Seljookee sultan Tughril-Beg espoused the cause of the ’Abbâsee caliph, his brother lbraheem Eyna,l revolted, joined El-Besâseeree, and defeated Tughril-Beg. El-Besâseeree entered Baghdad, in which the combat continued to rage; and the unfortunate city was devastated by massacre and pillage. El-Mustansir was solemnly declared Prince of the Faithful, and the insignia of the legitimate caliph was sent to El-Kâhireh. The success of El-Besâseeree, however, was but transient; Tughril-Beg had, in the meantime, defeated and killed his brother Ibraheem; he then entered Baghdad in Dhu-l-Kaadah 451, and despatched a force against El-Besâseeree, who fell in a battle near El-Koofeh.

A persecution of the Christians of Alexandria occurred about this time; and in 454 commenced a desolating struggle between the blacks and the Turks, both of whom had become numerous in Egypt. The former were succoured by the mother of El-Mustansir, [9:7:752] herself a negress, while the command of the latter was taken by Nâsir-ed-Dowleh Ibn-Hamdân, a general of El-Mustansir, more than once governor of Damascus, and at this period governor of Lower Egypt. To this man’s unscrupulous ambition was due much of the trouble which ensued. After many battles the Turks succeeded in destroying the power of their adversaries, and their leader assumed almost absolute authority, while they not only extorted from the caliph immense sums of money and treasure, but even rifled the tombs of his predecessors for the valuables which they contained. At the same time the bulk of the valuable library of the Fâtimees was dispersed by these brigands. But the very power of Nasir-ed-Dowleh threatened his overthrow. His sense of security in his position rendered him regardless of the support of the Turks; and when at length his schemes for the deposition of El-Mustansir brought matters to a crisis, a large portion of the army declared against him. Defeated and driven from the metropolis, he succeeded in possessing himself of Lower Egypt, and a terrible civil war raged between the contending parties. But an even heavier calamity afflicted Egypt. For seven successive years the inundation of the Nile failed, and with it almost the entire subsistence of the country, while the rebels intercepted supplies of grain from the north. El-Makreezee informs us that El-’Askar and EI-Katâë’ were depopulated, and that half the inhabitants of El-Fustat perished, while in El-Kahireh itself the people were reduced to the direst straits. Bread was sold for 14 dirhems the 1 lb loaf; and all provision being exhausted, the worst horrors of famine followed. The wretched people resorted to cannibalism, and organized bands kidnapped the unwary passenger in the desolate streets by means of ropes furnished with hooks and let down from the latticed windows. In the year 462 the famine reached its height. It was followed by a pestilence; and in the midst of these horrors, Nâsir-ed-Dowleh advanced on El-Kâhireh at the head of an enormous army; he was induced to withdraw by the promise of large concessions, only to repeat the attack, and finally to make himself master of the city, after having inflicted a signal defeat on the caliph, who became only the nominal raler of Egypt, a condition which lasted until the assassination of this powerful rebel in the year 465.

While these events were occurring in Egypt, Syria was in a continual state of anarchy and war. A distinguished general, the emeer El-Guyoosh Bedr-ed-Deen El-Gemâlee, held the government of Damascus during these times; and now El-Mustansir wrote, recalling him to assume the office of vizir of Egypt. On the condition of being allowed to bring with him a veteran force, he, happily for the country, obeyed the summons, and to his talents was owing the restoration of order and even prosperity which followed. By a massacre of emeers at a grand banquet shortly after his arrival, and by numerous executions, he subdued all opposition in the capital; and in a series of brilliant victories he annihilated the savage hordes who infested the country throughout its whole extent, having either been called to the aid of the contending parties, or voluntarily taken advantage of the universal confusion to commit their lawless ravages.

In concluding this necessarily extended notice of the reign of El-Mustansir, the invasion of Aksees with an army of Turkumans, Kurds, and Arabs, in the year 469, mιi3t be mentioned. Spreading devastation around them, they encamped near El-Kâhireh; and in the first engagement defeated the forces of El-Gemalee; but fortune favouring him in a second battle, the enemy was totally routed with immense carnage.

El-Mustansir reigned 60 years, and died in the year 487. He was a weak prince, solely given up to pleasure. El-Gemâlee had governed with almost absolute authority and great ability for a period of 20 years, dying only a few days before the caliph. While admiring El-Gemalee’s talents, we cannot but condemn his severity. He built the mosque which gives its name to the mountain immediately S.E. of the citadel of El-Kâhireh (Gebel-El-Guyooshee), and the second wall of the city, with its three principal gates, Bâb-Zuweyleh, Bâb-en-Nasr, and Bâb-el-Futooh. These gates, which are very fine specimens of architecture, are said to be the work of three Greek brothers.

El-Mustaalee bi-llah Abu-1-Kâsim Ahmad succeeded his father; but a son of El-Gemâlee, El-Afdal, had the principal management of the affairs of the kingdom. This caliph’s reign is memorable for the First Crusade. El-Afdal had taken Jerusalem from the Turks in the year 491 (a.t>. 1098); and a few months later it yielded to the Crusaders, after a siege of 40 days. El-Afdal arrived shortly after its fall with a reinforcement of 20,000 men, but he was defeated in the battle of Ascalon. Later, an Egyptian army, commanded by Saad-ed-Dowleh, was worsted by Baldwin, count of Edessa, and the general was killed in the action. From this period, with the exception of some efforts made in the next reign, to the time of Salah-ed-deen (“Saladin”), Egypt was too much occupied with intestine troubles to equip expeditions against the various parties who now straggled for the possession of Syria. El-Mustaalee died in the year 495. He is stated to have been a S∏nnee, a strange anomaly in a dynasty of Shiya’ces.

His son El-A'mir bi-ahkâmi-llâh Aboo-’Alee Mansoor came to the throne at the age of five years, and until his arrival at manhood the government was conducted by El-Afdal. The first act of the caliph, however, on taking it into his own hands, was to put his minister to death, and appoint in his stead a man whose wickedness obliged him to imprison him and afterwards condemn him to death. The rale of El-A'mir was chiefly remarkable for his impiety and tyranny, and for the successes of the Crusaders, who, having reduced many of the principal coast-towns in Syria, meditated the conquest of Egypt, and crossed the frontier, but were deterred from the prosecution of their enterprise by the illness of Baldwin, whose death took place at El-Areesh, on his way back to Jerusalem. El-A'mir was put to death in 524, at the town of El-Geezeh, it is said by partisans of El-Afdal, whose son then usurped the entire government, setting up, as caliph, El-Hâfidh li-deeni-llâh Abd-El-Megeed, a grandson of El-Mustansir (El-Ämir having left no male issue), but without the usual ceremonies of installation. This vizir, Aboo-’Alee Ahmad, even forbade the mention of El-Hâfidh in the public prayers, and inserted his own name in his stead. He perished in a popular tumult, roused by his extortions and arbitrary' rule, and El-Hâfidh was duly declared caliph and received the oaths of allegiance. After the death of Ahmad, he successively appointed three other vizirs; but these proving equally refractory, he at length dispensed with that office altogether. He reigned nearly 20 years. The licentiousness of his son and successor, Edh-Dhâfir bi-aadâï-llâh Aboo-Mansoor Isma’eel, occasioned his death in four years and seven months at the hand of his vizir El-’Abbâs.

El-Faïz bi-llah Abu-1-Kâsim ’ Eesa Ibn-’Aleewas, on his accession in 549, only five years of age, and the history' of his times presents merely the contentions of rival vizirs, of whom the chief were El-Melik Es-Salih Tataë Ibn-Ruzzeyk, and his competitor El-’Abbas, before named. The latter, finding his power failing, gathered together the wealth he had amassed and fled to Syria, where he fell into the hands of the Crusaders, who stripped him of all that he had and detained him a prisoner. Eventually he was given up to Tataë and crucified over the gates of the palace.

El-Faïz died in the year 555, and El-’Adid li-deeni-llâh Aboo-Mohamrnad Abd-Allah, a grandson of El-Hafidh, and the last of the Fâtimee caliphs, was raised to what was then but the shadow of a throne, the entire power being in the hands of Tataë, who by his oppression and cruelty well-nigh rendered El-’Adid, by nature benevolent and wise, as tyrannical as himself. He was assassinated after a year by the secret orders of the caliph, and the latter to conceal his agency in this act installed his son El-’Àdil in his place. At this time the well-known Shawir was governor of the Sa’eed (or Upper Egypt), a post next in importance to that of prime minister. During the last three reigns the vizirs had been rapidly increasing in power; and the annals of the period are entirely occupied with the rise and fall of potent grandees, all eager for a post which conferred on its possessor the supreme authority. At length, in the reign of this unfortunate prince, they consummated the rain of,the dynasty and overwhelmed themselves in its fall. In 558 El-’Adil dispossessed Shawir of his government, and the latter had immediate recourse to arms, marched against his enemy, and succeeded in putting him to death. He then constituted himself vizir, but in his turn was compelled to flee from a more powerful rival, Ed-Dirgham. Noor-ed-Deen (Noureddin), the sultan of Damascus, received the fugitive with favour; and in the course of the next year (559) despatched an army to Egypt, under the command of Asad-ed-Deen Sheerkooh, to reinstate him. In the meantime Ed-Dirgham had been busy putting to death the great men of the empire; and having thus weakened his power, he offered but a feeble resistance, was overthrown in a battle near the tomb of the Seyyideh Nefeeseh, on the S. of El-Kahireh, and Shawir was restored. No sooner, however, was this effected, than he forgot the engagements into which he had entered with Noureddin, and threw off his allegiance to him. Sheerkooh retired to the Sharkeeyeh, and occupied the town of Bilbeys, and thence threatened Shawir. In this position of affairs the latter had recourse to the Crusaders, who willingly responded to his call, and Amaury, king of Jerusiflem, arrived with a considerable force. With these allies, Shawir besieged his former protector in Bilbeys, until, hearing of Noureddin’s successes over the Franks in Syria, they negotiated a peace, and permitted Sheerkooh to withdraw from Egypt. About two years later, Noureddin, determined on punishing the treachery of Shawir, again sent Sheerkooh into Egypt with a great army, and accompanied by his nephew, the famous Saladin. Shawir again sought to strengthen himself by an alliance with Amaury, from whom he received the first intelligence of the meditated invasion. Apprised of this knowledge of his movements, Sheerkooh changed his course from Bilbeys, entered the valley of the Nile at some distance above Cairo, and crossing the river marched northwards to El-Geezeh. Here he endeavoured to raise ths people against Shawir and his Frank confederates; and had in some measure su∞eeded when the superior forces of the enemy [9:7:753] compelled him to retreat southwards as far as El-Babeyn, near Ashinooneyn, where he risked an engagement, and gained a complete victory. . This success opened to the invaders the greater part of Egypt, and Alexandria itself fell into their hands. Saladin was placed in that city with a numerous garrison, and his uncle departed to subdue the rest of Egypt. The Crusaders, however, at once closely invested Alexandria, and so pressed the siege for three months, as to oblige Sheerkooh to come to its relief. An honourable compromise was effected, by which the Syrians agreed to resign their conquests and evacuate Egypt. But fresh troubles were in store for this unfortunate country. Amaury, irritated at the result of a campaign in which he had only lost, determined on an expedition against his recent ally; and, entering Egypt, took Bilbeys, putting its inhabitants to the sword, and laid siege to El-Kahireh, his course being marked by the most dreadful barbarities. On his approach, the ancient city of El-Fustât was set on fire by order of the vizir, to prevent it falling into the enemy’s hands, and it continued bunιing somewhat more than fifty days. El-’Adid now earnestly sought the aid of Noureddin; and that monarch, actuated by religious zeal against the Franks, who had already felt his power in Syria, and by the desire of conquest, once more despatched Sheerkooh. In the meantime negotiations had been opened with Amaury to raise the siege of El-Kâhireh, on payment of an enormous sum of money; while, however, the conditions were yet unfulfilled, the approach of the Syrian army induced him to retreat in all haste. Sheerkooh and Saladin entered the capital in great state, were received with honour by the caliph and with obsequiousness by the perfidious Shâwir, who was contriving a plot which was fortunately discovered and for wlιich he z paid with his head. Sheerkooh was then appointed vizer by El-’Adid, but dying very shortly, he was succeeded in that dignity by Saladin 564 (A.υ. 1169).

For the short period which elapsed before Saladin’s assumption of the title of sultan a few words will suffice. One of his first acts was to put to death the chief of the eunuchs, and a revolt of the blacks resulted; a combat took place in El-Kâhireh in the street called Beyn-el-Kasreyn; and the malcontents being worsted, the disturbances were quelled. Bahâ-ed-Deen Karâkoosh, a white eunuch, who afterwards played a prominent part in the reign of Saladin, was appointed to the vacant post. This gave the vizir great in∩uence in the palace, of which he judiciously availed himself. In 565 we hear of Amaury with Greek allies unsuccessfully besieging Damietta; and in the following year, Saladin conducted an expedition against the Franks to Ascalon and Ramleh. In, 567, by order of Noureddin, he suppressed the name of El-’Adid in the congregational prayers, and substituted that of the ’ Abbasee caliph, a masterly stroke of policy to secure the adhesion of the orthodox Muslims. The last of the Fâtimees was lying dangerously ill, and his relations concealed from him his degradation. He died without the knowledge of it, and with him perished an illustrious but unfortunate dynasty.

Saladin was thus relieved of the most serious obstacle on his way to the throne; yet he dared not throw off his allegiance to the sultan of Damascus, but prudently waited for a favourable opportunity. Noureddin’s suspicion was already aroused, and he died (in 569) while secretly preparing to proceed in person to Egypt. Saladin almost immediately proclaimed himself sultan of Egypt, and inaugurated his reign with a series of brilliant successes. With the conquest of El-Mo’izz, Egypt again took an important place among the nations; and by the wars of Saladin it became the nucleus of a great empire. But military glory was not the sole aim of this prince and his successors. The patronage they continued to extend to letters and the arts had the most beneficial effect upon the civilization of the couutry.

Saladin, whose full appellation was El-Melik En-Nâsir Salâh-ed-deen Yoosuf Ibn-Eiyoob, ' acquired his greatest renown by his campaigns against the Crusaders in Syria. As these belong, however, more properly to the history of those wars than to that of Egypt, they will be more briefly noticed in this place than would otherwise be necessary. The youth of El-Melik Es-Sâlih Isma’eel, the son and successor of Noureddin, and the consequent confusion which prevailed in his dominions, gave Saladin a fair pretext to occupy Damascus, as the guardian of the young prince, and enabled him to wrest from him his kingdom. He thus considerably enlarged his territory, made himself master of a great portion of Syria, and continued to consolidate his power in those parts until the year 572 (a.d. 1178), when Philip, count of Flanders, laid siege to Antioch, and Saladin entered Palestine. Having encamped before Ascalon, the Egyptian troops ravaged the neighbouring country, and set fire to Joppa, until at length Baldwin the Leper, king of Jerusalem, issued from Ascalon and gave them battle. The result was disastrous to Saladin: his army was totally routed, and he himself fled alone on a dromedary. After this, however, he gained some partial advantages over the Christians, till a terrible famine induced him two years later to conclude a truce with the king of Jerusalem and to retire to Egypt.

In the year 576 he again entered Syria and made war on Kilij-Arslân, the Seljookee sultan of Anatolia, and on Leon, king of Armenia, the Cilicio-Armenian kingdom, both of whom he forced to make terms of peace. Not long after his return, Saladin departed from Egypt (a.h. 578) to prosecute a war with the Crusaders in which neither side desired peace. Their hostility was aggravated by the following circumstances. A vessel bearing 1500 pilgrims had been wrecked near Damietta, and its passengers captured; and to the remonstrances of the king of Jerusalem the sultan replied by complaining of the constant inroads made by Renaud de Châtillon. At this time the latter turbulent chief undertook an expedition against Eyleh, and for this purpose constructed boats at Karak and conveyed them on camels to the sea; but this flotilla was repulsed, and ths siege raised by a fleet sent thither by El-’Ädil (“Saphedin ”), the brother of Saladin, and then his viceroy; and a second attempt was still more unfortunate, the Christian captives on that occasion were sacrificed in the valley of Mina. Having threatened Karak, Saladin encamped at Tiberias, and ravaged the territory of the Franks; he then besieged Beyroot, but in vain; and thence turned his arms against Mesopotamia and subdued the country, but the city of Mosul successfully resisted him. In the meanwhile, the Crusaders contented themselves with miserable forays across the enemy’s borders, and made no serious preparations for the return of their redoubtable antagonist. The latter, having been almost everywhere successful in Mesopotamia, took Tell-Kh<did and ’Eyn-Tâb in Syria and obtained possession of Aleppo; he again besieged Karak, ravaged the territory of Samaria, and later received the fealty of the lord of Mosul, but not the keys of the city.

In the year 582 (1186 of our era) war again broke out between Saladin and the Crusaders. The sultan had respected a truce into which he had entered with Baldwin the Leper, and Renaud, before named, was the first to break it. The capture by the latter of a rich caravan enraged Saladin, who despatched orders to all his lieutenants and vassals, summoning them to assist in the “Holy War.” He marched (a.d. 1187) from Damascus to Karak, and there laid close siege to Renaud; at the same time a large body of cavalry under the command of his son, El-Afdal, advanced on Nazareth; and here a body of 130 Knights Hospitallers and Templars, seconded by a few hundred foot soldiers, and encouraged by the heroic Jacques de Maillé, marshal of the Temple, by their devotion immortalized their memory. Only the Grand Master of the Temple and two of his knights escaped from the unequal struggle. Soon after, Saladin approached in person at the head of an army of 80,000 men; and the Christians with their whole force encountered him on the shore of the Lake of Tiberias. The result of the battle which ensued was the heaviest blow which had yet fallen on the Crusaders. Weakened by thirst, shaken by the flight of a part of their troops on the second day of combat, and overwhelmed by numbers, the knights fought with desperate courage, but at length were forced to the hills of Hitteem. A multitude fell in this bloody fight, and among the prisoners were Guy [9:7:754] do Lusignan (the king of Jerusalem and successor of Baldwin), with his brother and Renaud de Châtillon. The number of prisonersis almo3t incredible; and the massacre of many of them is an indelible stain on the glory of the generally merciful Saladin. Tiberias, Ptolémaïs (Acre), NAbulus, Jericho, Ramleh, Caesarea, Arsoor, Joppa, Beyroot, and many other places successively fell into the hands of the conqueror. Tyre resisted his attacks; but Ascalon surrendered on favourable terms, and the fall of Jerusalem crowned these victories. The great clemency of Saladin on this occasion is chronicled by Christian historians, though it is but slightly mentioned by the Muslims, who took offence at the mercy shown to the enemies of their faith.

After these events Tyre was again besieged, and when about to capitulate was relieved by the arrival of Conrad, son of the marquis of Montferrat. The valiant defence of the town wearied Saladin, who turned his arms against Tripoli; but here he met with no better success. Bohemond, prince of Antioch, and at that time possessor of Tripoli also, was, however, glad to obtain a truce of eight months; and some strongholds (among others Karak) were taken. But now the fortune of war turned against the sultan. The ever-memorable siege of Acre, maintained with equal constancy by both Christians and Muslims, lasted upwards of two years, and attracted the attention of the whole western world. At length the immense reinforcements received by the besiegers, and the presence of Richard Coeur de Lion of England and of Philip IL of France, enabled them to overcome all resistance, and the standards of the Cross floated on the ramparts of the city (a.d. 1191). A horrible act of barbarity was here perpetrated: 2700 Muslim captives were massacred in cold blood, in consequence of Saladin’s having failed to fulfil the terms of the capitulation; and the palliative plea of the heat of an assault cannot be urged in extenuation of this enormity. Richard has been accused of being its author; but Michaud believes with reason that it was decided on in a council of the chiefs of the Crusade. On another occasion, however, that king was certainly guilty of similar cruelty.

After a period of repose and debauchery, the army of the Crusaders, commanded by Richard, directed its march towards Jerusalem. Saladin harassed his advance on every point, rendered the cities and strongholds defenceless, and ravaged the country. Richard, nevertheless, was ever victorious; his personal bravery struck terror into the Muslims, and he gained a signal victory over the sultan in the battle of Arsoor. But dissensions among the chiefs of his army and the uncertain temper of the commander himself debarred the Crusaders from the attainment of their great object, the deliverance of the Holy City; and when all the coast from Joppa to Tyre was in the hands of the Christians, and the army of Saladin was threatened with disorganization, a treaty was concluded, and Richard set sail on his return to England. The glory acquired by Saladin, and the famous campaigns of Coeur de Lion, have rendered the Third Crusade the most memorable in history, and shed a lustre on the arms of both Muslims and Christians greater than they ever attained in those wars, either before or afterwards.

Saladin died about a year after the conclusion of this peace (a.π. 589 or J193 of our Era) at Damascus, at the age of fifty-seven years. Ambition and religious zeal appear to have been his ruling passions; he was courageous, magnanimous, and merciful, possessed of remarkable military talents and great control over himself. His generosity to the vanquished and hrs faithful observance of his passed word are lauded by the historians of the Crusades; the former brought on him much obloquy among his own fierce soldiers, and is a trait in his character which is worthy of note in the annals of a time when this virtue was extremely rare. While engaged in the conduct of his continual wars, he was not unmindful of the welfare of Egypt, and during his reign many public works were executed. Of these we may mention especially the citadel of Cairo, with the magnificent buildings which, until very recently, it contained; the third wall of the city; and the repair of the great canal called the Bahr Yoosuf, a very important and useful work. From the year 578 until the period of his death he had not entered Egypt; but his brother El-Melik El-’Adil Seyf-ed-deen (Saphedin) and other princes of his family successively governed that country, and the eunuch Karâkoosh, who also defended Acre, held a large share of authority.

On the death of Saladin, his extensive dominions were divided chiefly among his sons, and Egypt fell to the lot of one of them, El-Melik El-’Azeez Imâd-ed-Deen ’ Othman. The grandees supported his claim to the throne, and he proved himself worthy of their choice. In conjunction with El-’Adil, we find him warring against the leaders of the Fourth Crusade. He reigned nearly six years, and was succeeded (in 595) by his son El-Mansoor Mohammad, whose uncle El-Afdal was compelled to relinquish the government of Damascus and assume the regency of Egypt. Disagreement among the sons of Saladin had occurred soon after that monarch’s death, and now hastened the rise of El-’Adil, who, by his military talents and other remarkable qualities, had excited the fears of even his brother. With the view of checking his growing ascendancy, El-Afdal formed an alliance against him with Edh-' Dhahir, another son of Saladin and lord of Aleppo, and besieged him in Damascus; but coming to strife, they raised the siege in 597. This attempt proved fatal to the power of El-Afdal. He was pursued to Egypt, in his turn besieged in El-Kâhireh, and forced to flee, and El-’Adil was proclaimed sultan. Having dethroned El-Mansoor, he speedily recovered Damascus from the hands of the confederate brothers, and Syria with Egypt acknowledged his supremacy. El-’Àdil (as Saphedin) is especially known by his opposition to the Fourth and Sixth Crusades, the former of which took place before his accession to the throne. He repulsed the Christians near Nâbulus, captured Joppa, and encountered the enemy between Tyre and Sidon. He was there defeated with heavy loss, and Sidon, Laodicea, Gibleh, and Beyrout were taken. But the Crusaders wasted their strength before the fortress of Thoron. El- ’Adil raised the siege of that place, and although afterwards he met with a reverse near Joppa, his adversaries bought a dear victory; and, having come to terms of peace, they returned to Europe. In the year 600 (a.d. 1204) he departed to Syria with the object of securing Jerusalem against threatened attacks, and concluded a trιιce which he offered to renew when about to expire; and to prove his good faith, he strengthened that offer by promising to cede ten castles to the Christians. These overtures were refused, and the Muslim army drove the newly arrived king of Jerusalem, Jean de Brienne, back to Europe. Those who remained then professed their willingness to accede to conditions of peace, and we do not again hear of El-’Adil in Palestine until 614 (A.D. 1217), when he was once more called thither to oppose the Crusaders; but a serious invasion of Egypt by these troublesome adventurers hastily recalled its king, and he died of grief, it is said, on hearing of the advantages gained by them.

El-Kamil immediately (615) came to the throne, and took the most energetic measures for the protection of his kingdom. In the meantime, the Franks had besieged Damiettaboth by sea and land; and, notwithstanding every effort for the relief of the place, its garrison was forced to capitulate. El-Kamil summoned to his aid the princes of his family, and with every available man watched the enemy’s movements. Flushed with success, Jean de Brienne commenced his march on the capital; and with the characteristic carelessness of the Crusaders he took no measures to secure supplies. His advance was stopped at the junction of the canal of Ashmoon with the Nile, where he found El-Kamil in a very strong position. Encamped on the opposite shore, the invaders depended for supplies on Damietta and its immediate district; but the inundation of the Nile gradually obstructed land-carriage, and El-Kamil, skilfully availing himself of this natural ally, caused boats to be carried overland to the enemy’s rear, and, thus cut off by land and water, they were compelled to attempt a retreat. At Beyramoon, however, all further progress was found to be impossible, the inundation had covered the level country, and the sultan’s boats blockaded the Nile. The Franks surrendered, and evacuated Damietta, but not before Egypt had suffered severely from the ravages they committed. The town of El-Mansoorah was founded on the site of El-KamiΓs camp, and commemorates his energy and sagacity. The Seventh Crusade was invited by the same sultan who had thus suffered by an invasion of the Franks. In A.n. 1228, El-Kamil invoked the aid of Frederick II. against his brother El-Moadhdham, lord of [9:7:755] Damascus, and, in consequence of this alliance, Jerusalem, with Bethlehem and the places between it and Joppa and Acre, Nazareth and the territory of Thoron and Sidon, with its dependencies, was ceded to Frederick on the 20th of Feb. 1229. Between these two monarchs existed the most friendly relations, presenting a curious spectacle in the midst of the intrigues and hatred of their subjects for each other, and endangering their popularity and even their lives. After various expeditions against h ’ 's brother and his successors, El-Kamil gained possession of Damascus, and died there in the year 635 (a.p. 1238). lie was distinguished by military talents and rare moderation, and was also a learned man, a patron of the arts, and a good king.

His son, El-Melik El-’Adil the Younger, was declared sultan of Egypt and Syria, with the consent of the nobles, and he speedily banished those ministers whose counsels he feared, and appointed creatures of his own. Oppressed by his tyranny, and impoverished by his extravagance, the people called his brother Es-Sâlih Negm-ed-Deen Eiyoob to the throne; and he deposed and imprisoned El- ’Àdil in the year 637, and to replenish his exhausted treasury, ordered all who had received presents from the late sultan to restore them to his successor. In the next year serious disturbances nroke out in Syria; ’Imâd-ed-Deen, who had taken Damascus in the reign of El-’Adil, formed an alliance with the Franks, and purposed the conquest of Egypt; the hostile armies met at Acre, and the Muslim soldiers of ’ Imad-ed-Deen deserting to the banner of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob, the Franks were routed. Negotiations for peace were then attempted, but these failing, the Franks were again induced to take the field by the cession of Jerusalem and other places. The king of Egypt, on his part, called to his assistance the Tatars of Kharesm, who took Jerusalem and overran Syria. In the next campaign (642) they were joined by the army of Es-Sâlih, under the command of his favourite slave Beybars, or Bibars, who was destined to play a conspicuous part in Egyptian history. At Gaza the allied army met the Franks, eager to avenge themselves on the Khares-mees for the horrible atrocities of which they had been guilty in the preceding campaign, and willingly joined by the Muslim princes of Damascus, Hirns, and Karak; on the first day the battle raged with unabated fury from daybreak to sunset, and was continued on the morrow until the prince of Hims, having lost 2000 men, gave way and fled towards Damascus. The Christians maintained the unequal fight with great constancy, and were only vanquished after the greater number had fallen. In these encounters 30,000 men (Christians and Muslims) were either killed or taken prisoners. Various successes followed this victory, Jerusalem was taken by the Egyptians, and Es-Sâlih laid siege to Damascus in person. The city having capitulated on favourable conditions, his fierce allies, enraged at the loss of pillage, quarrelled with him, and soon after joined his rebellious subjects. Damascus was reduced to the direst straits, but again fortune favoured Es-Sâlih. He hastened from Egypt, whither he had returned, and totally defeated the enemy. Other advantages were gained by his commander Fakhr-ed-Deen over the Franks in 645.

Although attacked by illness, the sultan was once more called to Syria to quell fresh troubles; but at Damascus news reached him of the threatened invasion of Egypt by the Crusaders under St Louis, and he travelled back in great suffering from his malady. Darnietta, which he rightly judged would be the first point of attack, was strengthened and well stored, and its defence was intrusted to Fakhr-ed-Deen. On Friday, June 4, A.υ. 1249, the French anchored before the place, and the. next day landed opposite the camp of the Egyptian general, who offered but slight opposition, and in the course of the next night betrayed his trust and retreated southwards. His army was precipitately followed by the entire population of Darnietta, and this important town with its stores fell into the hands of the invaders without a blow. Fakhr-ed-Deen nearly lost his life for this act of cowardice, and fifty-four of his principal officers were put to death. In the meantime the sultan’s illness gradually increased, but nevertheless he caused himself to be removed to the town of El-Mansoorah, which he fortified, and there he expired on Nov. 21, at the age of forty-four, and after a reign of ten years. He it was who introduced the Bahree Memlooks, a body of Turkish slaves, who composed his body-guard, and eventually usurped the supreme power. Their name Bahree (or “of the river ”) originated in their being trained and quartered on the island of Er-Rodah, where the sultan had built a palace.

The French were advancing southwards, and, notwithstanding the precautions of Sheger-ed-Durr (the widow of Es-Sâlih, who assumed the regency^), were apprised of the death of the sultan. Many partial actions took place on the march, and on Dec. 19, their army appeared before El-Mansoorah, the scene of the disaster of Jean de Brienne. Skirmishing continued until Shrove Tuesday, when, a traitor having shown the enemy a ford over the canal of Ashmoon, they surprised the camp and town. Very severe fighting ensued, Fakhr-ed-Deen fell early in the struggle, and the place was nearly lost, when the Bahree Memlooks led by Beybars furiously charged the assailants, and completely turned the fortune of the day. The morrow witnessed another battle, also disastrous to the Crusaders, .and a succession of misfortunes followed. Tooran-Shdh, on hearing of the death of his father, travelled in all haste from Mesopotamia to Egypt, and having reached the camp assumed the command. He had recourse to the stratagem which had proved so successful under the direction of El-Kâmil, and cut off the supplies of the enemy. This, coupled with disease, soon reduced St Louis to great straits, and he sent to propose a truce, but not coming to terms he resolved on retreating to Darnietta. A memorable conflict took place by land and water, and St Louis with lιis troops surrendered themselves prisoners of war.

Toorân-Shâh now gave himself up to debauchery, offended his nobles by bestowing hie favours only on certain creatures whom he had brought with him from Mesopotamia, and alarmed the queen by forcing her to render him an account of his father’s wealth. Sheger-ed-Durr appealed to the Memlooks, a conspiracy was formed, and the sultan was attacked in bis palace. He fled to a pleasuretower built on the banks of the Nile, which was set on fire in the presence of his army, the wretched king, from the summit, in vain promising to abdicate. He perished miserably, an<l his corpse lay unburied for many days on the bank. On his accession he had strangled a brother, and his fate deserves no pity.

Sheger-ed-Durr (vulgarly called Shegeret-ed-Durr), herself a slave, and the first of the Dynasty of the Bahree, or Turkish Memlooks, succeeded to the throne; and ’ Izz-ed Deen Eybek was appointed commander of the forces. After many delays, St Louis agreed to pay 400,000 livres as a ransom for himself and his army, 200,000 to be paid in Egypt, and the remainder on the fulfilment of certain stipulations at Acre: Darnietta was surrendered and Egypt evacuated. Thus ended the last invasion of Egypt by the Crusaders. Sheger-ed-Durr, in order to strengthen herself on the throne, shortly after married the emcer Eybek, and caused him to be proclaimed sultan, with the title of El-Melik El-Mo’izz, in the year 648. The followers of the late Es-Sâlih, however, obliged Eybek to associate with himself in the sovereignty a young prince of the family of Eiyoob, El-Melik El-Ashraf MudhafΓar-ed-Deen Moosà. En-Nasir, a son of El-’Azeez, invaded Egypt, and after many combats was driven back to Syria, but the country continued in a very unsettled state. The chief of the adherents of the fallen dynasty was arrested by Eybek; and Beybars and other leading men having repaired to the citadel to demand satisfaction, his bloody head was thrown to them from the ramparts, and in terror they fled to Syria. El-Ashraf was then cast into prison, and there he died. But Eybek soon roused the jealousy of his beautiful and ambitious wife; and lie was assassinated by her orders (655, A.D. 1257). In her turn she was beaten to death, not many days after, by the wooden clogs of the female slaves of another wife of Eybek, and her corpse was exposed for three days in the moat of the citadel.

El-Melik El-Mansoor Noor-ed-Dcen ’Alee, son of Eybek, was now raised to the throne, and Beybars being apprised of the death of his rival attempted to regain his power in Egypt; but Kutz, the viceroy of Eybek and also of his son, attacked and routed him; and he soon after (657) desposed El-Mansoor, and declared himself sultan. El-Melik El-Mudhaffar Kutz began his reign by putting to death El-Mansoor and Sharaf-ed-Deen, the able minister of the last Eiyoobee kings and of the first of this dynasty. A reign thus cruelly commenced ended tragically. Kutz was diverted from these severe measures by the advance of Hoolâgoo, grandson of Genghis-Khân, who, with a formidable army, overran El-’Irâk and Syria. By great efforts Kutz raised a considerable force and marched to meet him. The intelligence of the death of the Moghul emperor had, however, in the meantime recalled Hoolâgoo, who left Ketboogha to encounter the Egyptian sultan. The battle declared in favour of the latter, and Syria was restored to his rule. Returning in triumph to Egypt, he was assassinated on the frontier by Beybars in the year 658, and this Memlook (who had but recently fought under his banner against the Tatars) was forthwith chosen by the emeers to be his successor.

The brilliant reign of El-Melik Edh-Dhâhir Beybars El-Bun-dukdâree is so perplexed and full of incident as to render a concise account of it very difficult. It began with the reduction of a revolt in Syria. The rebels were supported by a Tatar army under Hoolâgoo, but Beybars was everywhere victorious, ar.d Damascus surrendered at discretion. Having subdued all opposition in this quarter, he endeavoured to improve the condition of Egypt, abolished the exorbitant imposts under which the people groaned, and welcomed to the court Ahmad, son of the caliph Edh-Dhâhir, who was declared Prince of the Faithful with the title of El-Mustansir bi-llâh, and-furnished with a small force, by which he hoped to establish himself in Baghdad. He was, however, repulsed by the Tatars and put to death. The succeeding line of caliphs, possessed of spiritual, but no temporal authority, remained at the court of the Memlook sultans until the Turkish conquest. From this time, Beybars continued to extend and confirm his rule. Ilis first expedition was to Syria agaiust the Christians, and the Church of the Nativity at Nazareth was destroyed. Thence he went to the fortified town of Karak, which had more than once resisted the attacks of Saladin, but opened its gates to the Memlook conqueror.
[9:7:756]

and its territory was added to his dominions. À grept scarcity afflicted Cairo in 662, and Beybars threw open the Government stores, and strove in every way to alleviate the sufferings of his subjects.

In 663 he again entered Syria, and took Caesarea and Ursoof; and in the next year he commenced a series of campaigns against the Christians, notwithstanding the earnest remonstrances of the kings of France, of Aragon, and of Armenia. To raise the necessary funds for the expenses of the war, he took occasion from the occurrence of many incendiary fires in Cairo, during his absence, to mulct their co-religionists of the sum of 500,000 deenars, ostensibly to repair the damage caused by these fires. He threatened Acre, and took Safad; and relieved from the apprehensions caused by the advance of the Tatars by the death of Hoolâgoo and the retreat of his army, Beybars despatched a force which effected the conquest of Armenia, and penetrated to the borders of Anatolia, a transient success which was speedily annulled by the advent of Abâkâ Khan, the son of Hoolâgoo. In the next war, Beybars again attacked the Christians, burning their churches and enslaving the people. He took Antioch, with horrible carnage, advanced to Hims and Hamah, and thence returned to Cairo. After a campaign against the Tatars, he ravaged the country around Acre (the constant object of his attacks), and the “Assassins,” so long the terror of dynasties, submitted to his power. About this time the Tatars renewed their inroads and besieged Beyrah; and in the year 671 Beybars took the field against them with two armies, one commanded by himself in person, the other by Kalâ-oon El-Elfee. In the battle of Beyrah the sultan was completely victorious, and the Tatars fled to the mountains of Kurdistan. In consequence of this victory, Armenia again fell into his hands, and was given up to pillage. Abâkâ Kinin afterwards was again repulsed at Beyrah. N ubia also about this time acknowledged the authority of Beybars. He died at Damascus in the year 676, after another expedition against Anatolia, attended with various success, in which the Tatars were leagued against him. Great military talents, coupled with the most indefatigable activity, Beybars certainly possessed, but he used his conquests unmercifully; on many occasions he ravaged whole provinces, and sacked many towns, putting great numbers of the inhabitants to the sword. The melancholy annals of the Crusades bear ample testimony to this fact; and while the example of other monarchs, and of the Franks themselves, may be urged as some palliation, nevertheless his barbarity remains an indelible blot on his character. In Egypt he endeavoured to reform abuses and suppress vice; and numerous public works were executed by his orders. Damietta was razed and rebuilt farther inland; and the mouth of the Nile was protected by a boom against sudden invasion. He repaired the fortifications of Alexandria and the Pharos, the mosque El-Azhar in Cairo, and the walls of the citadel, and built the great mosque known by his name to the north of the city.

The son and successor of Beybars, El-Melik Es-Sa’eed Barakeh Khan, was exiled after a short reign of two years, and a younger brother El-’Ädil Selâmish, raised to the throne, Kalâ-oon El-Elfee acting as regent. This Memlook had married a daughter of Beybars, and was consequently nearly allied to the sultan. He nevertheless conspired against him, and was soon proclaimed king by the title of El-Melik El-Mansoor. Distinguished in former wars, he achieved many successes during his reign of ten years. On his accession he despatched an army to reduce disturbances in Syria, and took Damascus. Peace was thus established in that province; and in the year 680 he in person defeated a very superior force of Tatars and raised the siege of Rahabeh. Later in his reign (in the year 688) he besieged Tripoli, which for nearly two centuries had been in the possession of the Christians and was very rich and flourishing. The town was sacked and its unfortunate inhabitants put to the sword. His memoιy is still preserved in Cairo by his hospital and mad-house adjoining his fine mosque in the principal street of the city. This charitable institution he is said to have founded as an expiation for great severity towards the citizens in enforcing an obnoxious edict. His son, El-Ashτaf Khaleel, rendered himself famous by the siege and capture (in the year 690) of Acre, the last stronghold of the Crusaders in Syria. Many thousands of its inhabitants were massacred; and 10,000 who presented themselves before the sultan and demanded quarter were slaughtered in cold blood. He also took Erzeroom in 691, and two years after was assassinated in Egypt (a.d. 1294).

El-Melik En-Nâsir Mohammad, another son of Kalâ-oon, succeeded him at the age of nine years. The regent Ketbooghà, however, followed the example of Kalâ-oon, and usurped the (sovereignty, with the title El-Melik El-’Adil. Pestilence and famine were followed by war with the Tatars, who again ravaged Syria. Ketbooghà despatched an army against them, but the valour of bis troops was unable to withstand overpowering numbers, and lAgeert, Kalâ-oon’s governor in Syria, was driven into Egypt with an immense crowd of fugitives. Ketbooghà was deposed on the allegation that he had not commanded in person, and El-Melik El-Mansoor Lâgeen was elevated in his stead. In little more than two years this king was deposed in a conspiracy. I lis character was amiable, and he deserved a better return for the equity and kindness he showed to his subjects.

A short period of confusion then ensued, during which an emeer was proclaimed king. En-Nasir Mohammad, however, was at length recalled from his exile at Karak, and restored in the year 698. Having firmly established himself in Egypt, he led an army against the Tatars, but met with a severe reverse in the plains of Hims; a second expedition proved more fortunate, and En-Nasir, then only nineteen years of age, gained a bloody and decisive victory over the enemy near Damascus, in the year 702. The battle lasted three days; during the first two the result was not decisive, although En-Nâsir held the field; on the third day the Tatars were utterly routed and pursued for many hours. The sultan on his entry into Cairo after this achievement was preceded by 1600 prisoners, each one carrying the head of a comrade slain in the combat, and 1000 other heads were borne on lances in the procession. En-Nasir reigned until the year 707, when he went to Karak and voluntarily abdicated. He had long struggled against the control of two powerful emeers, Beybars and Silâr; and in despair of throwing off their ascendency, he then openly yielded the reins of government to those who had long really held them. Since this prince’s accession the Christians and Jews of Egypt suffered the most severe persecution (excepting that of El-Hâkim) which had yet befallen them. In the year 700, they were ordered to wear blue and yellow turbans respectively, and forbidden to ride on horses or mules, or to receive any Government employment. The people took advantage of these measures to destroy many churches and synagogues. The churches continued shut for about a year; but some of those which had been destroyed wore afterwards rebuilt at the request of Lascaris and other princes.^[54. see Modern Egyptians, supplement; El-Makreezee, ZΓιst. des Sultans Mamlouks, trs. Quatreτnfere, tom. ii., livr. ii. 177, seqq.; and, for further information on the persecutions of the Christians, Quatremfere , s Mémoires sur CEyypte, tom. U. 220-266.] Another event of this period was a great earthquake which half ruined Cairo, giving it the appearance of a city demolished by a siege; Alexandria and other towns of Egypt, as well as Syria, also suffered from it considerably.

On the abdication of En-Nâsir, El-Melik El-Mudhaffar Rukn-ed-Deen Beybars II. was saluted sultan; but ere long En-Nâsir recovered his courage, and having collected an army marched to Damascus, where he was acknowledged, and thence to Egypt, entering Cairo without opposition. El-Mudhaffar had fled at his approach, and, never a favourite of the people, he was attacked on his exit from the metropolis, by a crowd of the citizens, who loaded him with abuse, and pelted him with stones. El-Nâsir now for the third time ascended the throne of Egypt, and took the entire authority into his own hands. The remainder of his life was a period of profound peace, during which he occupied himself in improving his dominions, and in embellishing Cairo. But another persecution of the Christians occurred in 721, and all the principal churches in Egypt were destroyed by certain fanatical Moslems. The sultan threatened a general massacre of the inhabitants of Cairo and El-Fustât; the Christians, however, took revenge themselves by setting fire to very many mosques and houses in the metropolis; much tumult ensued, and many Christians and Muslims were executed. The threats of the mob induced En-Nâsir to permit the people to murder and plunder any Christian whom they might meet in the streets; and the oppressive rules before enacted were rigorously enforced, and made even more degrading.

The sons of En-Nâsir followed him in succession, but the reigns of most of them were short and troublous. El-Mansoor Seyf-ed-Deen Aboo-Bekr, El-Ashraf ’Alâ-ed-Deen Koojυok, En-Nâsir Shihâb-ed.Deen Ahmad, Es-Sâlih ’Imâd-ed-Deen Ismâ’eel, El-Kâmil Zeyn-ed-Deen Shâabân, and El-Mudhaffar Zeyii-ed-Deen Ilâggee were only raised to the throne to be either exiled or put to death. After these, the sultan Hasan deserves notice. He was deposed by his brother, Es-Sâlih Salâh-ed-Deen, whose minister was Sheykhoon, a man well known to students of Egyptian subjects; but he soon regained his authority, reigned seven years, and at length fell by the swords of his memlooks in the splendid mosque which he built in the open space beneath the citadel of Cairo. Four more Memlook kings bring the history to the accession of a new dynasty. These were El-Mansoor Nâsir-ed-Deen Hâggee (son of El-Mudhaffar), deposed in six months; El-Ashraf Shâabân (son of Hasan), an unfortunate prince, whose reign passed away amid the intrigues of the fainéant caliphs and the struggles of the now too powerful emeers,by whom he was ultimately strangled; his son, El-Mansoor ’Alâ-ed-Deen, the victim of similar troubles, in whose time the celebrated Barkook rose to the regency; and Es-Sâlih Hâggee, a brother of the last king. Exiled by Barkook, who was proclaimed sultan, he unsuccessfully endeavoured to recover his throne in the year 784; in 790 (a.d. 1388) he was restored, but he was soon once more dethroned, this time with the loss of his life.

The sultan Edh-Dhähir Seyf-ed-Deen Aboo-Sa’eed Barkook was [9:7:757] now undisputed master of Egypt. He was the first prince of the Dynasty of Burgee or Circassian Memlooks. As the preceding dynasty was founded by the Turkish Memlooks of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob, so this dynasty was composed of the Circassian slaves rvhom those kings from time to time bought with the view of strengthening their power. They were originally placed in garrison-towns, and hence their name Burgee, signifying “of a tower or castle.” It is worthy of remark that, while many of the sultans of both these dynasties held an insecure tenure of power, many of the former met with a violent death, but few of the latter. The reign of Barkook is memorable for his war with Teemoor, or Teemoor-leng, commonly called by us Tamerlane, who had extended his conquests towards his dominions, but found him not unprepared, for he had foreseen the threatened danger. In the year 795, Karà-Yoosuf, lord of El-Medeeyeh, and Ahmad Ibn-Uweys, sultan of Baghdad, lied to his court for succour. The inhabitants of Edessa had been l>ut to the sword, and Aleppo was menaced with a similar catastrophe, when Barkook at the head of his army came to its relief. Ahmad was reinstated in Baghdad, as a vassal of Barkook; and soon after the’Otlimâulee Bâyezeed, commonly called by us Bajazet, concluded a treaty with the sultan of Egypt. His designs against India diverted Teemoor from his projects in Syria, but Barkook continued vigilant and by every means sought to insure the safety of his kingdom. He died suddenly in 801, much beloved by his subjects and regarded by less powerful chiefs as their strongest bulwark against the Tatar monarch. He was called “Sheykh” for his wisdom and learning, and combined with these qualities those of a skilful general and a good king. He was active, wary, and provident, and possessed the military talents of Beybars without his severity. He seems to have been fond of riches and display, and he certainly left his treasury in a very nourishing condition, besides much wealth in stores, slaves, horses, and the like.

His son, El-Mclik En-Nâsir Abu-s-Sa’âdât Farag, fell a prey to intestine troubles and the inroads of the invader. He had overcome a revolt of the governor of Syria, when Teemoor again threatened that province. Karà-Yoosuf and Ahmad sought refuge with the son of their former protector, and Farag’s refusing to betray his guests gave occasion to the enemy to continue the war; a battle was fought, Farag was defeated, Aleppo and l·Iims fell into the hands of the victor, and the Egyptian forces returned and were concentrated in Egypt. Intimidated, however, by the fall of his ally Bajazet, Farag sent an embassy to Teemoor with presents and offers of amity, and at length concluded a peace at the sacrifice of territory. Teemoor died in the year 807 (a.d. 1405), and Farag was preparing an expedition to recover his Syrian possessions, when he was surprised in his palace by an insurrection, headed by his brother, ’Abd-el-’Azecz, and compelled to take to flight. The people believing that he had perished proclaimed El-Maιτsoor ’Abd-el-’Azeez his successor. In the space of less than three months, however, he was deposed in favour of Farag, who thenceforth reigned at Damascus, until the caliph El-Musta’een bi-llah, at the instigation of the emeer Sheykh El-Mahmoodee, who had raised an army, boldly declared himself sultan, by an appeal to religion gained numbers to his side, instituted criminal proceedings against Farag on the plea of the exactions which lie had been forced to levy for the conduct of the war against Teemoor, and accomplished his death. Farag was beheaded in the month of Safar in the year 815, and his corpse was left unburied. Abu-l-Mahasin gives him the character of an extravagant, cruel, and voluptuous king..

El-Musta’een bi-llah, with the title of El-Melik El-’Ädil Abu-1- Fadl, began his reign well; but he had appointed El-Mahmoodee his vizir as a reward for his services, and this powerful and vigorous chief soon obliged him to abdicate and eventually exiled him to Alexandria, where he passed the remainder of his days.

El-Melik El-Mu-eiyad Abu-n-Nasr Sheykh El-Mahmoodee "(originally a memlook of Barkook’s) waged three successful wars in Syria, in the first of which he was guilty of a breach of faith in putting to death the governor of Damascus and part of the garrison of that city, after they had surrendered on promise of safety. He reigned peacefully in Egypt, and his name is recorded as that of a king who studied the happiness of his subjects and favoured the learned, who counted him among their number. But he was avaricious; although one might judge the contrary from his beautiful mosque and the minarets oyer the Bâb-Zuweyleh in Cairo, held to be among the chief ornaments of the city.

Three kings followed in rapid succession :—El-MudhafTar Ahmad, a son of El-Mu-eiyad, under two years of age at his accession, Edh-Dhahir Tatar, and his infant son, Es-Sâlih Mohammad, who was deposed by Barsâbay Ed-Dukmâkee. This Memlook assumed the title of El-Melik El-Ashraf, and worthily continued the prosperous reign of El-Mu-eiyad. In power and virtue he ranks second only to Barkook among all the kings of this dynasty. He is known in European history by his expedition in 827 (a.d. 1424) against John III., king of Cyprus, who became his vassal, and by the part he took, about seven years later, in the dissensions of the house of Savoy and the government of Cyprus. He ruled for seventeen years with great clemency, and died in 841. El-’Azcez Yoosuf, his son, was deposed by El-Mansoor Aboo-Sa’eed Jakmak El-’Ala-ee, a good prince, and a patron of the learned. After a peaceful reign he abdicated at the age of about eighty years in favour of his son, El-Mansoor Abu-s-Sa’âdât Otlimân, who was overthrown by the intrigues of the caliph El-Kâïm bi-amri-llâh, and was succeeded by an aged Memlook, El-Ashraf-Abu-n-Nasr Eynal, followed by his son, El-Mu-eiyad Shihab-ed-Deen Abu-1- Fet-h Ahmad. Edh-Dhâhir Seyf-ed-Deen-Khoslikadam, a Greek by birth, superseded him, reigning himself for seven years, with equity and benignity, presenting a contrast to the cruelty and oppression of his appointed successor, Ed-Dhahir Aboo-Sa’eed Bilbây El-Alâ-ee, which caused the latter's fall and the elevation of the sultan Aboo-Sa’eed Temerbeg Edh-Dhahiree, who, in his turn, was deposed to make room for El-Ashraf Kâït Bey, a prince who deserves especial notice for his struggles with the Turks, whereby the conquest of Egypt by the Porte was deferred for a few years. After a period of quiet which followed his accession, he was alarmed by the victory gained by Mehemet II. over his ally the king of Persia, and posted a considerable force on the frontier of Syria. The successes of the conqueror of Constantinople made him desire to abdicate; but the emeers prayed him to defend his rights, and he consequently prepared for the war. The death of Mehemet, and the dissensions between Bajazet II. and Jem (or Zizim) temporarily relieved him of these apprehensions. The fall of Jem, however, and his arrival at the Egyptian court, implicated the Memlook sultan in the quarrel; and on the final overthrow of this prince Kâït Bey made sure of a war with the more fortunate Bajazet, and himself began aggressive measures, intercepted the Turkish caravan of pilgrims, and an ambassador from India who was on his way to Constantinople with presents, and took Tarsus and Adaneh. A remonstrance from Bajazet was answered by a successful attack on his Asiatic commander, ’Alâ-ed-Dowleh. In the meantime Tarsus and Adaneh were recovered from him; but the emeer El-Ezbekee, to whom was entrusted the conduct of all future wars, being despatched against these towns, retook them, defeated an army sent to chastise him, and annexed Karamania. Another force was speedily equipped, and took the field in 893; conditions of peace were refused, and considerable success attended the Turkish arms. El-Ezbekee was, therefore, again ordered to Syria; a Turkish squadron conveying troops was dispersed, and at Tarsus he gave battle. The result was at first unfavourable to the Memlooks, whose commander, however, rallied them under cover of the night, and succeeded in surprising and totally defeating the Turks. Long negotiations followed this victory; and at length Kâït Bey, who was always most anxious for peace, ceded the disputed towns of Tarsus and Adaneh, and secured repose during the rest of his days. He died in 901, having designated El-Melik En-Nâsir Abu-s-Sa’âdât Mohammad as his successor. This weak and barbarous king was put to death after four years, during which he was deposed, and Kânsooh, surnamed Khamsameeyeh, and Edh-Dhâhir Abu-n-Nasr Kânsooh were successively installed. The first reigned but eleven days, and the latter abdicated after five months of great dilliculty and danger. On the death of En-Nâsir, El-Ashraf Kânsooh Jânbalât was elevated to the throne, but six months sufficed to accomplish bis fall, and he was Jortunate in preserving his life. The next sultan, El-Melik El-’Adil Too-mân Bey, was acknowledged both in Egypt and Syria. He, however, was overthrown and killed in a few months.

The Memlooks now compelled Kânsooh EI-Ghoorec to assume the dangerous dignity, with the title of El-Melik El-Ashraf. This prince very unwillingly yielded. His previous life shows him to have been both virtuous and learned; and he proved himself to be an able ruler. After an unsuccessful expedition against the Portuguese in the East, he reigned in peace until the year 915, when Kurkood, the father of Selim I., the Turkish sultan, obtained his protection and assistance. Events similar to those which accompanied the end of Jem followed; and Selim availed himself of a pretext to declare war against Egypt. The first reverse which the Egyptians suffered occurred to an army commanded by ΆΙά-ed-Dowleh, formerly defeated by Kâït Bey, but now in the pay of El-Ghooree. The winter was passed by the latter in preparing energetically for the inevitable struggle, and in the spring he advanced in person. Selim, on his part, pretended to march towards Persia; but at the same time he sent to demand of EI-Ghooree wherefore he opposed his passage and commanded in person on the frontier. El-Ghooree replied that his was merely an army of observation, and that he was desirous of mediating between Selim and Ismâ’eel Shâh. Selim, however, rapidly advanced, refused to listen to an attempt at negotiation, and was met by El-Ghooree on the plain of Marj-Dâbik, near Aleppo. A long and sanguinary battle ensued, and victory declared for neither side, until Kheyr Bey, commanding the right wing, .and El-Ghazâlee the left, of the Egyptian army, basely deserted to the enemy with their troops. The centre then gave way and fled in utter confusion, notwithstanding the efforts of the sultan to rally them. He was trampled to death by his routed cavalry, while (according to some) in the act of prayer.
[9:7:758]

This event took place on the 26th of Regeb 922 (a.d. 1516). With his death Egypt lost her independence. The shattered remains of the army collected in Cairo. Tooman Bey, a nephew of the deceased king, was elected snltan, and at once determined on every resistance to the conqueror. His general in Syria, El-Ganbardee, disputed the road with Selim step by step, and Tooman Bey awaited his arrival near Cairo. Between El-Khankah and the metropolis, at the village of Er-Reydaneeyeh, the opposing armies joined battle, on the 29th of Zu-l-Heggeh (January 1, 1517). The fall of a favourite general, Sinan Pasha, infuriated the Turks, and the brilliant bravery of the Memlooks availed them not. Immense numbers of them were slain by their enemies in the pursuit, and the survivors reunited in Cairo. El-Ganbardee, however, sacrificed his fame by joining the victor. The Turkish army paused for rest; and time was thus given to Tooman Bey to hire Arabs at a great cost to replenish his thinned ranks. Selim now passed to the west of Cairo. A night surprise conducted by Tooman failed, but he succeeded in putting to the sword a great many Turks. He fortified himself in the city, and a house-to-house combat ensued, the Memlooks defending every foot with the energy of despair; the citadel fell by assault, and the unfortunate Tooman effected his escape towards Alexandria; but on the way he was taken by Arabs, given up to El-Ganbardee and another, and brought in chains to Selim, who at first received him with honour, but afterwards falsely accused him of conspiring against him, and, with the cruelty and perfidy characteristic of his race, hung him over the Bäb-Zuweyleh, the pjace of execution for common malefactors. Thus miserably perished the last independent ruler of Egypt, who possessed the best qualities of his line, and whose noble defence of his kingdom would have secured to him the commiseration of any but a Turk.

In reviewing the period during which Egypt was governed by independent Muslim princes, it is necessary to consider the spirit of the times and the people over whom they ruled. They succeeded to the government of countries worn out by incessant warfare, overrun by savage hordes, and debased by the rule of the Lower Empire. Egypt had long struggled against the slavery to which it was condemned, and the history of the last three dynasties of Pharaohs evincee the patriotism which yet animated her people. But the successive tyranny of the Persians, the Greeks, and the Romans appears to have annihilated their nationality; and when the Arabs invaded the country, these causes, combined with religious strife, induced the people to afford to the conquerors every assistance in their power. But the changeful rule of the lieutenants and the troubles of the caliphs debarred Egypt (except at times under the Benee-Tooloon and the Ikhsheedeeyeh) from profiting by the enlightenment of the race who held the dominion over it, until the conquest by the Fàtimees. The caliphs of that dynasty contributed in a great degree to restore to Egypt some portion of its ancient prosperity, and with the house of Eiyoob it attained its greatest military glory under the Muslims; but the edifices erected during the rule of the two dynasties of Memlook kings, the libraries collected in Cairo at that period, and the learned men who then flourished would point to it as the age in which literature and the arts were cultivated with the most success, a sure evidence of the internal prosperity of any country. This is the more surprising when we consider the state of Syria, which had long before their accession fallen a prey to intestine wars and the ravages of the Tatars, the Crusaders, and other invaders, and also bear in mind the constitution of their government, in which the more powerful chiefs were constantly aiming at the supreme authority; and the practice of purchasing memlooks, and rearing them in the households of the great to enable their masters to maintain their ascendency augmented the number of these aspirants to the throne. These slaves were, unlike the Bahrees (who were the Turkish Memlooks of Es-Sâlih Eiyoob), chiefly Circassians, who afterwards composed the Second (or Burgee) Dynasty. Many of the Memlook sultans rivalled in military achievements the great Saladin, and even penetrated further than he in their foreign expeditions. In Cairo are etill seen the finest specimens of Arab architecture, almost ail dating during the period comprised under the domination of the two Memlook dynasties; the libraries of the mosques, and the private collections of that city, though grievously injured since the Turkish conquest, are or very recently were the best and most considerable of those of Egypt or Syria;^[55. It should, however, be mentioned that many of the most precious of their contents are plunder brought from tiιe libraries of mosques in Syria, as is proved by seals which they bear.] and, as before remarked, the university El-Λzhar is still, owing to the fostering care of these sultans, the principal seat of learning of the Eastern world. In this sketch of the history of Egypt we have given no account of the state of commerce, taxation, &c., under the Muslims. Those only who have read the Arab histories of this and other Eastern countries can appreciate the general fallacy of the conclusions based on their authority.

It would be tedious and unprofitable to follow the details of Turkish misrule and tyranny which are from this time presented to the student of Egyptian history. Although Selim had apparently destroyed the power of the Memlooks, he thought it wise to conciliate them, and to appoint twenty-four beys over the military provinces of that number into which he divided Egypt, subject to the supreme control of a pasha, whose council was formed of seven Turkish chiefs (ôjàklees), while one of the beys held the post of Sheykh el-Beled, or Governor of the Metropolis, an officer who became an object of hatred to the other chiefs. This system was begun by Selim, and completed by his successor. For nearly two centuries the successive pashas were mostly obeyed; but the ambition of becoming Sheykh el-Beled was the fruitful cause of intrigue and murder. The Memlooks who then held power in Egypt were called the Ghuzz, that being the name of the tribe to which they are said to have at first generally belonged; and they continually bought slaves, of Circassian or Georgian race, to supply the place of children, for they did not intermarry with natives of Egypt, and women of more northern climates are generally either barren or bear sickly offspring in that country. Thus they lacked the surest source of power; few possessed any family ties; but at the same time the slaves in general were remarkably faithful to their patrons. After two centuries, the beys gradually increased in power, until the authority of the pasha was almost nominal, and the government became a military oligarchy. This brings us to the rise of the celebrated Ali Bey. He was created Sheykh el-Beled in A.H. 1177; but, having revenged himself on an old enemy who had assassinated Ali’s master, to whom he owed his elevation to the rank of bey, he shortly after fled to Syria, and took refuge with the governor of Jerusalem, and thence went to Acre, where the Sheykh Dlιahir became his friend; and that same year he returned to Cairo in his former capacity of Sheykh el-Beled. In 1179 his enemies again compelled him to flee, and he betook himself this time to El-Yemen, once more to return to Egypt; after which he gained increased power. His favourite memlook, Mohammad Aboo-Dhahab, proved ungrateful, and, while enjoying the highest power, entered into a conspiracy against his life; but after receiving the presents of the hostile beys, he denounced them to his master, who would not listen to warnings of his meditated treachery.

In the year 1182 (a.d. 1768) the Porte demanded the assistance of Ali Bey in the Russian war, an order which he was about to obey, when he was apprised of the departure of a messenger with a firmàn demanding his head, he having been falsely accused at Constantinople of intending to aid the Russians and throw off his allegiance. He caused the bearer of this order to be waylaid and put to death, and having possessed himself of the firmàn, he convened[9:7:759] the beys, showed them the document, and aided by those of his own household persuaded the council to expel the pasha, and declare Egypt independent. The Sheykh Dhâhir took part in this rebellion, and the pasha of Damascus was beaten by him between Mount Lebanon and Tiberias. A period of good but vigorous government and of tranquillity followed these events in Egypt, notwithstanding the very heavy imposts levied for the replenishment of the treasury; and Ali’s generals gained for him extended power abroad. Mohammad Aboo-Dhahab was despatched to Arabia, and entered Mecca, where the Shereef was deposed; and another bey traversed the eastern shores of the Red Sea. After the expedition to Arabia, Mohammad Bey marched into Syria to assist the Sheykh Dhâhir against the Porte, and the co-operation of the Russians was demanded. A successful campaign terminated before the walls of Damascus, the siege of which was abandoned when nearly brought to a close, and Mohammad Bey returned with large forces to Egypt. This man, loaded with benefits by his patron, now openly rebelled; and being joined by Ali’s enemies, at the head of whom was Ismail, chief of the guard, he advanced on Cairo, and Aii escaped to his steady ally, Sheykh Dhâhir, the prince of Acre. These events took place the year 1186. Mohammad Bey was then declared Sheykh el-Beled. Ali Bey, in the meanwhile, in conjunction with his ally, gained various advantages in Syria, and, on the information that his return was desired in Egypt, he collected a small force, assisted by Sheykh Dhâhir and a Russian squadron, and determined on attempting to recover his power. He, however, fell into an ambuscade near Es-Sâliheeyeh, and was wounded by one of his memlooks named Murâd (afterwards Murâd Bey), carried to the citadel, and poisoned by Mohammad Bey. Thus terminated the career of the famous Ali Bey, a man whose energy, talents, and ambition bear a strong resemblance to those of the later Mehemet Ali.

Mohammad Bey continued Sheykh el-Beled, tendered his allegiance to the Porte, and was invested with the pashalik. He then entered Syria, and severely chastised Sheykh Dhâhir, taking Gaza, Joppa, and Acre itself. Joppa was taken by assault, and suffered a massacre of its inhabitants, and Acre was pillaged. At the latter place the pasha suddenly died. His mosque in Cairo is the latest fine specimen of Arab architecture, and is not unworthy of its better days.

The chief competitors for power were now Ismail, Ibrahim, and Murâd, the first of whom was speedily expelled, the contest continuing between the two latter beys. Ibrahim at length succeeded in causing himself to be proclaimed Sheykh el-Beled, and Murâd contented himself with the office of Emeer el-Hâgg, or chief of the pilgrims; but this arrangement was not destined to be of long continuance; a violent quarrel resulted in a recourse to arms, and that again in a peace of three years’ duration, during which the two beys held an equal sway. In the year 1200 the Porte despatched Hassan Capitan (properly Kapoodân) Pasha (or High Admiral), with a Turkish force, to reduce the turbulent Memlooks to obedience, and to claim the annual tribute. Murâd Bey was defeated at Er-Rahmâneeyeh, and the Turks advanced to Cairo, desolating the country, and acting according to their almost invariable practice on such occasions. The metropolis opened its gates to Hasan Pasha, who determined on pursuing the beys to Upper Egypt, whither he despatched a large portion of his army, and a sanguinary conflict took place. But a war with Russia recalled this commander to Constantinople. Ismail was again created Sheykh el-Beled, and he held that post until the terrible plague of the year 1205, in which he perished, and hence it is commonly called the “Plague of Ismail.” His death caused the return of Ibrahim and Murâd; and eight years after, intelligence of the arrival at Alexandria of a French army of 36,000 men, commanded by General Bonaparte, united these chiefs in a common cause.

On the 18th May 1798, this expedition, consisting of 13 sail of the line, 6 frigates, and 12 vessels of a smaller size, sailed from Toulon, and made the coast of Egypt on the 1st July. The troops were landed near Alexandria, and the city fell by assault on the 5th of that month. The French conquest and occupation of Egypt belong to European history; a recapitulation of the principal events of the period will therefore suffice in this place. The Memlooks affected to despise their antagonist, and hastened to chastise him: at Shibirrees they attacked the French and were repulsed; but, nothing discouraged, they collected all their forces, exceeding 60,000 men, under the command of Murâd, and entrenched themselves at Embâbeh, opposite Cairo. Here was fought the battle which has been dignified with the name of that of the Pyramids. European tactics completely bewildered the Memlooks: their famous cavalry was received on the bayonets of the French squares; a galling fire of grape and musketry mowed down their ranks; and of this great army only about 2500 horse escaped with Murâd Bey, while 15,000 men of all arms fell on the field of battle. Having made himself master of Cairo, Bonaparte despatched General Desaix to effect the conquest of Upper Egypt, and the success of the Eastern expedition seemed secured. But, ten days after the victory of Embâbeh, the battle of the Nile annihilated the French fleet in Aboo-Keer (Aboukir) Bay, and most materially influenced the future conduct of the war. On this point, Napoleon himself says, “La perte de la bataille d’Aboukir eut une grande influence sur les affaires d’Egypte et même sur celles du monde; la flotte Française sauvée, l’expédition de Syrie n’éprouvait point d’obstacles, l’artillerie de siège se transportait sûrement et facilement au-delà du désert, et Saint-Jean-d’Acre n’arrêtait point l’armée Française. La flotte Française détruite, le divan s’enhardit à déclarer la guerre à la France. L’armée perdit un grand appui, sa position en Égypte changea totalement, et Napoléon dut renoncer à l’espoir d’asseoir à jamais la puissance Française dans l’Occident par les résultats de l’expédition d’Egypte.”^[56. Napoleon, Mémoires, t. ii.] The disastrous expedition into Syria, undertaken for the purpose of frustrating the efforts of Sir Sydney Smith before Alexandria, and of Jezzâr I’asha, who was advancing from Acre, still further obscured Napoleon’s prospects in the East, and the victory soon after obtained by him over the Ottoman army at Aboo Keer, the second defeat of Murâd Bey, and various successes over the Turks, enabled the French general Kléber (Napoleon having left for Europe after the first of these events) to set on foot negotiations for an honourable evacuation of the country. But when the convention was already signed, and the French were about to quit Cairo, Lord Keith signified to Kléber that Great Britain would not consent to the terms of the treaty; and although this refusal was afterwards rescinded, Kléber considered that the withdrawal came too late: he totally defeated 70,000 men under the grand vizir at Heliopolis, and returned to Cairo to quell an insurrection of the inhabitants. This distinguished officer was about this time assassinated in the garden of his palace by a fanatic, who was impaled in the great square (then a lake) called the Ezbekeeyeh, in Cairo, and miserably lingered for the space of three days before death put an end to his sufferings. Under Kléber’s administration, Egypt began to resume its former prosperity; by his conciliatory and good government much prejudice against the French was overcome; by ceding a part of Upper Egypt to Murâd, he gained the good will of that chief, who gave him no cause to regret [9:7:760] this politic step; while under his auspices the “savans” of the Institute of Egypt collected the valuable mass of information embodied in the “great French work,” the Description de Vf: g ypte.

On the death of Kléber, General Menou succeeded to the command, and although he afterwards conducted the defence of the country with much valour, yet to his injudicious administration, and his want of military talent, we must mainly ascribe the determination of the British Government to attempt the expulsion of the French from Egypt, and the rapid success of the campaign that ensued. On the 2d of March 1801 an army under Sir Ralph Abercromby arrived in Aboo-Keer Bay, and made good a landing in the face of a well-disposed French force, which offered every possible resistance. The memorable battle of Alexandria, in which Abercromby fell, decided the fate of the war. A bold march, executed with talent, effected the capitulation of Cairo; Alexandria surrendered on the 1st of September, and the French sailed from the shores of Egypt in the course of that month.^[57. Very many of the French had either married Muslim women, or bought concubine slaves of the same faith, whom, on their departure, they left behind them; and these unfortunates were forthwith tied up in sacks and drowned.] General Hutchinson had taken the command of the English expedition, afterwards reinforced by a detachment from India under General Baird; and the army of the grand vizir, and that of the capitan-pasha, with the troops of Ibrahim Bey (Murâd having died of the plague), had co-operated in the measures which led to the evacuation of the country by Menou.

The history now requires that we should mention the early career of a man who subsequently ruled the destinies of Egypt for a period of nearly forty years. Mehemet Ali Pasha was born in a.h. 1182 (a.d. 1768-9) at Cavalia, a small sea-port town of Albania. On the death of his father, in early life, he was brought up in the house of the governor of the town, who, as a reward for military prowess, gave him his daughter in marriage. By her he had, it is said, his three eldest sons, Ibrahim,^[58. Ibrahim is, however, believed by many, or most, to have been the wife’s son by a former husband.] Toosoon, and Ismail. Having attained the rank of bûluk-bâshee (or head of a body of infantry), he became a dealer in tobacco, until, in his thirty-third year, he was despatched to Egypt with his patron’s son, Ali Âghâ, and 300 men, the contingent furnished by his native place to the Turkish expedition against the French; and soon after his arrival in that country he succeeded, on the return of Ali Aghâ, to the command, with the nominal rank of beenbâshee (or chief of a thousand men).

Soon after the evacuation of Egypt by the French, that unfortunate country became the scene of more severe troubles, in consequence of the unwarrantable attempts of the Turks to destroy the power of the Ghuzz. In defiance of promises to the English Government, orders were transmitted from Constantinople to Hoseyn Pasha, the Turkish high admiral, to ensnare and put to death the principal beys. Invited to an entertainment, they were, according to the Egyptian contemporary historian El-Gabartee, attacked on board the flag-ship; Sir Robert Wilson and M. Meħgin, however, state that they were fired on, in open boats, in the bay of Aboo-Keer. They offered an heroic resistance, but were overpowered, and some made prisoners, some killed, while some, including the afterwards celebrated ’Osmân Bey El-Bardeesee, escaped in a boat, and sought refuge with the English, who at that time occupied Alexandria. General Hutchinson, informed of this treachery, immediately assumed threatening measures against the Turks, and in consequence, the killed, wounded, and prisoners were given up to him. Such was the commencement of the disastrous struggle between the Memlooks and the Turks.

Mohammad Khusruf was the first pasha after the expulsion of the French. The form of government, however, was not the same as that before the French invasion, for the Ghuzz were not reinstated. The pasha, and through him the sultan, endeavoured on several occasions either to ensnare them or to beguile them into submission; but these efforts failing, Mohammad Khusruf took the field, and a Turkish detachment 14,000 strong, despatched against them to Demenhoor, whither they had descended from Upper Egypt, was defeated by a small force under El-Elfee; or, as Mengin says, by 800 men left by El-Elfee under the command of El-Bardeesee. Their ammunition and guns fell into the hands of the Memlooks.

In March 1803 the British evacuated Alexandria, and Mohammad Bey El-Elfee accompanied them to England to consult respecting the means to be adopted for restoring the former power of the Ghuzz. About six weeks after, the Arnaoot (or Albanian) soldiers in the service of Khusruf tumultuously demanded their pay, and surrounded the house of the defterdâr, who in vain appealed to the pasha to satisfy their claims. The latter opened fire from the artillery of his palace on the insurgent soldiery in the house of the defterdâr, across the Ezbekeeyeh. The citizens of Cairo, accustomed to such occurrences, immediately closed their shops, and the doors of the several quarters, and every man who possessed any weapon armed himself. The tumult continued all the day, and the next morning a body of troops sent out by the pasha failed to quell it. Tâhir, the commander of the Albanians, then repaired to the citadel, gained admittance through an embrasure, and, having obtained possession of it, began to cannon the pasha over the roofs of the intervening houses, ariu. then descended with guns to the Ezbekeeyeh, and laid close siege to the palace. On the following day, Mohammad Khusruf made good his escape, with his women and servants and his regular troops, and fled to Damietta by the river. This revolt marks the commencement of the rise of Mehemet Ali to power in Egypt, and of the breach between the Arnaoots and Turks which ultimately led to the expulsion of the latter.

T⅛hir Pasha assumed the government, but in twenty-three days he met with his death from exactly the same cause as that of the overthrow of his predecessor. He refused the pay of certain of the Turkish troops, and was immediately assassinated. A desperate conflict ensued between the Albanians and Turks; and the palace was set on fire and plundered. The masters of Egypt were now split into these two factions, animated with the fiercest animosity against each other. Mehemet Ali became the head of the former, but his party was the weaker, and he therefore entered into an alliance with Ibrahim Bey, and ’Osmân Bey El-Bardeesee. A certain Ahmad Pasha, who was about to proceed to a province in Arabia, of which he had been appointed governor, was raised to the important post of pasha of Egypt, through the influence of the Turks and the favour of the sheykhs; but Mehemet Ali, who with his Albanians held the citadel, refused to assent to their choice; the Memlooks moved over from El-Geezeh, and Ahmad Pasha betook himself to the mosque of Ez-Zâhir, which the French had converted into a fortress. He was compelled to surrender by the Albanians; the two chiefs of the Turks who killed Tâhir Pasha were taken with him and put to death, and he himself was detained a prisoner. In consequence of the alliance between Mehemet Ali and El-Bardeesee, the Albanians gave the citadel over to the Memlooks; and soon after, these allies marched against Khusruf Pasha, who having been joined by a considerable[9:7:761] body of Turks, and being in possession of Damietta, was enabled to offer an obstinate resistance. After much loss on both sides, he was taken prisoner and brought to Cairo; but he was treated with respect. The victorious soldiery sacked the town of Damietta, and were guilty of the barbarities usual with them on such occasions.

A few days later, Ali Pasha El-Tarâbulusee landed at Alexandria with an imperial fîrmân constituting him pasha of Egypt, and threatened the Beys, who now were virtual masters of Upper Egypt, as well as of the capital and nearly the whole of Lower Egypt. Mehemet Ali and El-Bardeesee therefore descended to Rosetta, which had fallen into the hands of a brother of Ali Pasha, and having recovered the town and captured its commander, El-Bardeesee purposed to proceed against Alexandria; but the troops required arrears of pay which it was not in his power to give, and the pasha had cut the dyke between the Lakes of Aboo-Keer and Mareotis, thus rendering the approach to Alexandria more difficult. El-Bardeesee and Mehemet Ali therefore returned to Cairo. The troubles of Egypt were now increased by an insufficient inundation, and great scarcity prevailed, aggravated by the exorbitant taxation to which the beys were compelled to resort in order to raise money to pay the troops; while murder and rapine prevailed to a frightful extent in the capital, the riotous soldiery being under little or no control. In the meantime, Ali Pasha, who had been behaving in an outrageous manner towards the Franks in Alexandria, received a khatt-i-shereef from the sultan, which he sent by his secretary to Cairo. It announced that the beys should live peaceably in Egypt, with an annual pension each of fifteen purses and other privileges, but that the government should be in the hands of the pasha. To this the beys assented, but with considerable misgivings; for they had intercepted letters from Ali to the Albanians, endeavouring to alienate them from their side to his own. Deceptive answers were returned to these, and Ali was induced by them to advance towards Cairo at the head of 2500 men. The forces of the beys, with the Albanians, encamped near him at Shalakân, and he fell back on a place called Zufeyteh. They next seized his boats conveying soldiers, servants, and his ammunition and baggage; and, following him, they demanded wherefore he brought with him so numerous a body of men, in opposition to usage and to their previous warning. Finding they would not allow his troops to advance, forbidden himself to retreat with them to Alexandria, and being surrounded by the enemy, he would have hazarded a battle, but his men refused to fight. He therefore repaired to the camp of the beys, and his army was compelled to retire to Syria. In the hands of the beys, Ali Pasha again attempted treachery. A horseman was seen to leave his tent one night at full gallop; he was the bearer of a letter to OsmΛn Bey Hasan, the governor of Kinè. This offered a fair pretext to the Memlooks to rid themselves of a man whose antecedents and present conduct proved him to be a perfidious tyrant. He was sent under a guard of forty-five men towards the Syrian frontier; and about a week after, news was received that in a skirmish with some of his own soldiers he had fallen mortally wounded.

The death of Ali Pasha produced only temporary tranquillity; in a few days the return of Mohammad Bey El-Elfee (called the Great or Elder) from England was the signal for fresh disturbances, which, by splitting the Ghuzz into two parties, accelerated their final overthrow. An ancient jealousy existed between El-Elfee and the other most powerful bey, El-Bardeesee. The latter was now supreme among the Ghuzz, and this fact considerably heightened their old enmity. While the guns of the citadel. those at Masr El-’Ateekah, and even those of the palace of El-Bardeesee, were thrice fired in honour of El-Elfee, preparations were immediately commenced to oppose him. His partisans were collected opposite Cairo, and El-Elfee the Younger held El-Geezeh; but treachery was among them; Hoseyn Bey El-Elfee was assassinated by emissaries of El-Bardeesee, and Mehemet Ali, with his Albanians, gained possession of El-Geezeh, which was, as usual, given over to the troops to pillage. In the meanwhile El-Elfee the Great embarked at Rosetta, and not apprehending opposition, was on his way to Cairo, when a little south of the town of Manoof he encountered a party of Albanians, and with difficulty made his escape. He gained the eastern branch of the Nile, but the river had become dangerous, and he fled to the desert. There he had several hairbreadth escapes, and at last secreted himself among a tribe of Arabs at Ras-el-Wâdee. A change in the fortune of El-Bardeesee, however, favoured his plans for the future. That chief, in order to satisfy the demands of the Albanians for their pay, gave orders to levy heavy contributions from the citizens of Cairo; and this new oppression roused them to rebellion. The Albanians, alarmed for their safety, assured the populace that they would not allow the order to be executed; and Mehemet Ali himself caused a proclamation to be made to that effect. Thus the Albanians became the favourites of the people, and took advantage of their opportunity. Three days later they beset the house of the aged Ibrahim Bey, and that of El-Bardeesee, both of whom effected their escape with difficulty. The Memlooks in the citadel directed a fire of shot and shell on the houses of the Albanians which were situated in the Ezbekeeyeh; but on hearing of the flight of their chiefs, they evacuated the place; and Mehemet Ali, on gaining possession of it, once more proclaimed Mahomet Khusruf pasha of Egypt. For one day and a half he enjoyed the title; the friends of the late Tahir Pasha then accomplished his second degradation,^[59. Khusruf Pasha afterwards filled with credit several of the highest offices at Constantinople. He died on the 1st of February 1855. He was a bigot of the old school, strongly opposed to the influences of Western civilization, and consequently to the assistance of France and England in the Crimean wsr.] and Cairo was again the scene of terrible enormities, the Albanians revelling in the houses of the Memlook chiefs, whose hareems met with no mercy at their hands. These events were the signal for the reappearance of El-Elfee.

The Albanians now invited Ahmad Pasha Khursheed to assume the reins of government, and he without delay proceeded from Alexandria to Cairo. The forces of the partisans of El-Bardeesee were ravaging the country a few miles south of the capital and intercepting the supplies of corn by the river; a little later they passed to the north of Cairo and successively took Bilbeys and Kalyoob, plundering the villages, destroying the crops, and slaughtering the herds of the inhabitants. Cairo was itself in a state of tumult, suffering severely from a scarcity of grain, and the heavy exactions of the pasha to meet the demands of his turbulent troops, at that time augmented by a Turkish detachment. The shops were closed, and the unfortunate people assembled in great crowds, crying Yâ Lateef! Υά Lateef! “0 Gracious [God] !” El-Elfee and’OsmAn Bey Hasan had professed allegiance to the pasha; but they soon after declared against him, and they were now approaching from the south; and having repulsed Mehemet Ali, they took the two fortresses of Turà. These Mehemet Ali speedily retook by night with 4000 infantry and cavalry; but the enterprise was only partially successful. On the following day the other Memlooks north of the metropolis actually penetrated into the suburbs; but a few days later were defeated in a battle fought at Shubrà, with heavy loss [9:7:762] on both sides. This reverse in a measure united the two great Memlook parties, though their chiefs remained at enmity. El-Bardeesee passed to the south of Cairo, and the (jrhuzz gradually retreated towards Lipper Egypt. Thither the pasha despatched three successive expeditious (one of which was commanded by Mehemet Ali), and many battles were fought, but without decisive result.

At this period another calamity befell Egypt; about 3000 Delees arrived in Cairo from Syria. These troops had been sent for by Khursheed in order to strengthen himself against the Albanians; and the events of this portion of the history afford sad proof of their ferocity and brutal enormities, in which they far exceeded the ordinary Turkish soldiers and even the Albanians. Their arrival immediately recalled Mehemet Ali and his party from the war, and instead of aiding Khursheed was the proximate cause of his overthrow.

Cairo was ripe for revolt; the pasha was hated for his tyranny and extortion, and execrated for the deeds of his troops, especially those of the Delees: the sheykhs enjoined the people to close their shops, and the soldiers clamoured for pay. At this juncture a firmàn arrived from Constantinople conferring on Mehemet Ali the pashalic of Jiddeh; but the occurrences of a few days raised him to that of Egypt.

On the 12th of Safar 1220 (May 1805) the sheykhs, with an immense concourse of the inhabitants, assembled in the house of the kadee; and the ’Ulemà, amid the prayers and cries of the people, wrote a full statement of the heavy wrongs which they had endured under the administration of the pasha. The ’Ulemà, in answer, were desired to go to the citadel; but they were apprised of treachery; and on the following day, having held another council at the house of the kadee, they proceeded to Mehemet Ali, and informed him that the people would no longer submit to Khursheed. “Then whom will ye have 1” said he. “We will have theef they replied, “to govern us according to the laws; for we see in thy countenance that thou art possessed of justice and goodness.” Mehemet Ali seemed to hesitate, and then complied, and was at once invested. On this, a bloody struggle commenced between the two pashas. Cairo had before experienced such conflicts in the streets and over the housetops, but none so severe as this. Khursheed, being informed by a messenger of the insurrection, immediately laid in stores of provisions and ammunition, and prepared to stand a siege in the citadel. Two chiefs of the Albanians joined his party, but many of his soldiers deserted. Mehemet Ali’s great strength lay in the devotion of the citizens of Cairo, who looked on him as their future deliverer from their afflictions; and great numbers armed themselves, advising constantly with Mehemet Ali, having the seyyid ’Omar and the sheykhs at their head, and guarding the town at night. On the 19th of the same month, Mehemet Ali besieged Khursheed. Retrenchments were raised, and the lofty minaret of the mosque of the sultan Hasan was used as a battery whence to fire on the citadel; while gnus were also posted on the mountain in its rear. After the siege had continued many days, Khursheed gave orders to cannonade and bombard the town; and for six days his commands were executed with little interruption, the citadel itself also lying between two fires. Mehemet Ali’s position at this time was very critical: his troops became mutinous for their pay; the silàhdàr, who had commanded one of the expeditions against the Ghuzz, advanced to the relief of Khursheed; and the latter ordered the Delees to march to his assistance. The firing ceased on the Friday 7 , but recommenced on the eve of Saturday and lasted until the next Friday. On the day following, news came of the arrival at Alexandria of a messenger from Constantinople. The ensuing night in Cairo presented a curious spectacle; many of the inhabitants gave way to rejoicing, in the hope that this envoy would put an end to their miseries, and fired off their weapons as they paraded the streets with bands of music. The silàhdàr, imagining the noise to be a fray, marched in haste towards the citadel, while its garrison sallied forth, and commenced throwing up retrenchments in the quarter of ’Arab-el-Yesàr, but were repulsed by the armed inhabitants and the soldiers stationed there; and during all this time, the cannonade and bombardment from the citadel, and on it from the batteries on the mountain, continued unabated.

The envoy brought a firmàn confirming Mehemet Ali, and ordering Khursheed to repair to Alexandria, there to await further orders; but this he refused to do, on the ground that he had been appointed by a khatt-i-shereef. The firing ceased on the following day 7 , but the troubles of the people were rather increased than assuaged; murders and robberies were daily committed by the soldiery, the shops were all shut and some of the streets barricaded. While these scenes were being enacted, El-Elfee was besieging Demenhoor, and the other beys were returning towards Cairo, Khursheed having called them to his assistance.

Soon after this, a squadron under the command of the Turkish high admiral arrived in Aboo-Keer Bay, with despatches confirmatory of the firman brought by the former envoy, and authorizing Mehemet Ali to continue to discharge the functions of governor for the present. Khursheed at first refused to yield; but at length, on condition that his troops should be paid, he evacuated the citadel and embarked for Rosetta.

Mehemet Ali now possessed the title of Governor of Egypt, but beyond the walls of Cairo his authority was everywhere disputed by the beys, who were joined by the army of the silàhdàr of Khursheed; and many Albanians deserted from his ranks. To replenish his empty coffers he was also compel’ed to levy exactions, principally from the Copts. An attempt was made to ensnare certain of the beys, who were encamped north of the metropolis. On the 17th of August 1805, the dam of the canal of Cairo was to be cut, and some chiefs of Mehemet Ali’s party wrote, informing them that he would go forth early on that morning with most of his troops to witness the ceremony, inviting them to enter and seize the city 7 , and, to deceive them, stipulating for a certain sum of money as a reward. The dam, however, was cut early in the preceding night, without any ceremony. On the following morning, these beys, with their memlooks, a very numerous body, broke open the gate of the suburb El-Hoseyneeyeh, and gained admittance into the city from the north, through the gate called Bàb el-Futooh. They marched along the principal street for some distance, with kettle-drums behind each company, and were received with apparent joy by the citizens. At the mosque called the Ashrafeeyeh they separated, one party proceeding to the Azhar and the houses of certain sheykhs, and the other continuing along the main street, and through the gate called Bàb Zuweyleh, where they turned up towards the citadel. Here they were fired on by some soldiers from the houses; and with this signal a terrible massacre commenced. Falling back towards their companions, they found the bye-streets closed; and in that part of the main thoroughfare called Beyn-el-Kasreyn, they were suddenly placed between two fires. Tims shut up in a narrow street, some sought refuge in the collegiate mosque El-Barkookeeyeh, while the remainder fought their way through their enemies, and escaped over the city-wall with the loss of their horses. Two memlooks had in the meantime succeeded, by great exertions, in giving the alarm to their comrades in the quarter of the Azhar, who escaped by the eastern gate called Bàb el-Ghureiyib[9:7:763]. A horrible fate awaited those who had shut themselves up in the Barkookeeyeh. Having begged for quarter and surrendered, they were immediately stripped nearly naked, and about fifty were slaughtered on the spot; and about the same number were dragged away, with every brutal aggravation of their pitiful condition, to Mehemet Ali. Among them were four beys, one of whom, driven to madness by Mehemet All’s mockery, asked for a drink of water; his hands λvere untied that he might take the bottle, but he snatched a dagger from one of the soldiers and rushed at the pasha, and fell covered with wounds. The wretched captives were then chained and left in the court of the pasha’s house; and on the following morning the heads of their comrades who had perished the day before were skinned and stuffed with straw before their eyes. One bey and two others paid their ransom and were released; the rest, without exception, were tortured and put to death in the course of the ensuing night. Eighty-three heads (many of them those of Frenchmen and Albanians) were stuffed and sent to Constantinople, with a boast that the Memlook chiefs were utterly destroyed. Thus ended Mehemet All’s first massacre of his too confiding enemies.

The beys, after this, appear to have despaired of regaining their ascendency; most of them retreated to Upper Egypt, and an attempt at compromise failed. El-Elfee offered his submission on the condition of the cession of the Feiyoom and other provinces; but this was refused, and that chief gained two successive victories over the pasha’s troops, many of whom deserted to him.

At length, in consequence of the remonstrances of the English, and a promise made by El-Elfee of 1500 purses, the Porte consented to reinstate the twenty-four beys, and to place El-Elfee at their head; but this measure met with the opposition of Mehemet Ali and the determined resistance of the majority of the Memlooks, who, rather than have El-Elfee at their head, preferred their present condition; for the enmity of El-Bardeesee had not subsided, and he commanded the voice of most of the other beys. In pursuance of the above plan, a squadron under Sâlih Pasha, shortly before appointed high admiral, arrived at Alexandria on the 1st of July 1806, with 3000 regular troops, and a successor to Mehemet Ali, who was to receive the pashalik of Salonica. This wily chief professed his willingness to obey the commands of the Porte, but stated that his troops, to whom he owed a vast sum of money, opposed his departure. He induced the ’Ulema to sign a letter, praying the sultan to revoke the command for reinstating the beys, persuaded the chiefs of the Albanian troops to swear allegiance to him, and sent 2000 purses contributed by them to Constantinople. El-Elfee was at that time besieging Demenhoor, and he gained a signal victory over the pasha’s troops; but the dissensions of the beys destroyed their last chance of a return to pow er. El-Elfee and his partisans were unable to pay the sum promised to the Porte; Sâlili Pasha received plenipotentiary powers from Constantinople, in consequence of the letter from the ’Ulema; and, on the condition of Mehemet Ali’s paying 4000 purses to the Porte, it was decided that he should continue in his post, and the reinstatement of the beys was abandoned. Fortune continued to favour the pasha. In the following month, El-Bardeesee died, aged forty-eight years; and soon after, a scarcity of provisions excited the troops of El-Elfee to revolt. That bey very reluctantly raised the siege of Demenhoor, being in daily expectation of the arrival of an English army; and at the village of Shubra-ment he was attacked by a sudden illness, and died on the 30th of January 1807, at the age of fifty-five. Thus was the pasha relieved of his two most formidable enemies; and shortly after he defeated Shâheen Bey, with the loss to the latter of his artillery and baggage and 300 men killed or taken prisoners.

On the 17th of March 1807, a British fleet appeared off Alexandria, having on board nearly 5000 troops, under the command of General Fraser; and the place, being disaffect ed towards Mehemet Ali, opened its gates to them. Here they first heard of the death of El-Elfee, upon whose co-operation they had founded their chief hopes of success; and they immediately despatched messengers to his successor and to the other beys inviting them to Alexandria. The British resident, Major Misset, having represented the importance of taking Rosetta and Er-Rahmaneeyeh, to secure supplies for Alexandria, General Fraser, with the concurrence of the admiral, Sir John Duck-worth, detached the 31st regiment and the Chasseurs Britanniques, under Major-General Wauchope and Brigadier-General Meade, on this service; and these troops entered Rosetta without encountering any opposition; but as soon as they had dispersed among the narrow streets, the garrison opened a deadly fire on them from the latticed windows and the roofs of the houses. They effected a retreat on Aboo-Keer and Alexandria, after a very heavy loss of 185 killed and 262 wounded, General Wauchope and three officers being among the former, and General Meade and seventeen officers among the latter. The heads of the slain were fixed on stakes on each side of the road crossing the Ezbekeeyeh in Cairo.

Mehemet Ali, meanwhile, was conducting an expedition against the beys in U pper Egypt, and he had defeated them near Asyoot, when he heard of the arrival of the British. In great alarm lest the beys should join them, especially as they were far north of his position, he immediately sent messengers to his rivals, promising to comply with all their demands, if they should join in expelling the invaders; and this proposal being agreed to, both armies marched towards Cairo on opposite sides of the river.

To return to the unfortunate British expedition. The possession of Rosetta being deemed indispensable, Brigadier-General Stewart and Colonel Oswald were despatched thither, with 2500 men. For thirteen days a cannonade of the town was continued without effect; and on the 20th of April, news having come in from the advanced guard at El-Hamâd of large reinforcements to the besieged, General Stewart was compelled to retreat; and a dragoon was despatched to Major Macleod, commanding at El Hamâd, with orders to fall back. The messenger, however, was unable to penetrate to the spot; and the advanced guard, consisting of a detachment of the 71st, two companies of the 78th, one of the 35th, and De Rolles’s regiment, with a picquet of dragoons, the -whole mustering 733 men, was surrounded, and, after a gallant resistance, the survivors, who had expended all their ammunition, became prisoners of war. General Stewart regained Alexandria with the remainder of his force, having lost, in killed, wounded, and missing, nearly 900 men. Some hundreds of British heads were now exposed on stakes in Cairo, and the prisoners were marched between these mutilated remains of their countrymen.

The beys became divided in their wishes, one party being desirous of co-operating with the British, the other with the pasha. These delays proved ruinous to their cause; and General Fraser, despairing of their assistance, evacuated Alexandria on the 14th of September. From that date to the spring of 1811, the beys from timeto time relinquished certain of their demands; the pasha on his part granted them what before had been withheld; the province of the Feiyoom, and part of those of El-Geezeh and Benee-Suweyf, were ceded to Shâheen; and a great portion of the Sa’eed, on the condition of paying the land-tax, to the others. Many of them took up their abode in [9:7:764] Cairo, but tranquillity was not secured; several times they met the pasha’s forces in battle, and once gained a signal victory. Early in the year 1811, the preparations for an expedition against the Wahhâbees in Arabia being complete, all the Memlook beys then in Cairo were invited to the ceremony of investing Mehemet Ali’s favourite son, Toosoon, with a pelisse and the command of the army. As on the former occasion, the unfortunate Memlooks fell into the snare. On the 1st of March, Shâbeen Bey and the other chiefs (one only excepted) repaired with their retinues to the citadel, and were courteously received by the pasha. Having taken coffee, they formed in procession, and, preceded and followed by the pasha’s troops, slowly descended the steep and narrow road leading to the great gate of the citadel; but as soon as the Memlooks arrived at the gate it was suddenly closed before them. The last of those who made their exit before the gate was shut were Albanians under Sâlih Koosh. To these troops their chief now made known the pasha’s orders to massacre all the Memlooks within the citadel; therefore, having returned by another way, they gained the summits of the walls and houses that hem in the road in which the Memlooks were incarcerated, and some stationed themselves upon the eminences of the rock through which that road is partly cut. Thus securely placed, they commenced a heavy fire on their defenceless victims; and immediately the troops who closed the procession, and who had the advantage of higher ground, followed their example. Of the betrayed chiefs, many were laid low in a few moments; some, dismounting, and throwing off their outer robes, vainly sought, sword in hand, to return, and escape by some other gate. The few who regained the summit of the citadel experienced the same cruel fate as the rest (for those whom the Albanian soldiers made prisoners met with no mercy from their chiefs or from Mehemet Ali), but it soon became impossible for any to retrace their steps even so far; the road was obstructed by the bleeding bodies of the slain Memlooks, and their richly caparisoned horses, and their grooms. 470 Memlooks entered the citadel; and of these very few, if any, escaped. One of these is said to have been a bey. According to some, he leapt his horse from the ramparts, aud alighted uninjured, though the horse was killed by the fall; others say that he was prevented from joining his comrades, and discovered the treachery while waiting without the gate. He fled and made his way to Syria. This massacre was the signal for an indiscriminate slaughter of the Memlooks throughout Egypt, orders to this effect being transmitted to every governor; and in Cairo itself, the houses of the beys were given over to the soldiery, who slaughtered all their adherents, treated their women in the most shameless manner, and sacked their dwellings. During the two following days, the pasha and his son Toosoon rode about the streets, and endeavoured to stop these atrocious proceedings; but order was not restored until 500 houses had been completely pillaged. In extenuation of this dark blot on Mehemet Ali’s character, it has been urged that he had received the order for the destruction of the Memlooks from Constantinople, whither the heads of the beys were sent. It may be answered to this plea, that on other occasions he scrupled not to defy the Porte.

A remnant of the Memk>oks fled to Nubia, and a tranquillity was restored to Egypt to which it had long been unaccustomed, and which has rarely been interrupted siιιce. In the year following the massacre, the unfortunate exiles were attacked by Ibrahim Pasha, the eldest son of Mehemet Ali, in the fortified town of Ibreem, in Nubia. Here the want of provisions forced them to evacuate the place; a few who surrendered were beheaded, and the rest went further south aud built the town of New Dongola (correctly Dunkulah), where the venerable Ibraham Bey died in 1816, at the age of eighty. As their numbers thinned, they endeavoured to maintain their little power by training some hundreds of blacks; but again, on the approach of Ismail, another son of the pasha of Egypt, sent with an army to subdue Nubia and Sennâr, some returned to Egypt and settled in Cairo, while the rest, amounting to about 100 persons, fled in dispersed parties to the countries adjacent to Sennâr.

Mehemet Ali, being undisputed master of Egypt, at the reiterated commands of the Porte despatched in 1811 an army of 8000 men, including 2000 horse, under the command of Toosoon Pasha, against the Wahhâbees. After a successful advance, this force met with a serious repulse at the pass of Safrà and Judeiyideh, and retreated to Yembo’. In the following year Toosoon, having received reinforcements, again assumed the offensive, and captured Medinah after a prolonged siege. He next took Jiddeh and Mecca, defeating the Wahhâbees beyond the latter place and capturing their general. But some mishaps followed, and Mehemet Ali, who had determined to conduct the war in person, left Egypt for that purpose in the summer in 1813. In Arabia he encountered serious obstacles from the nature of the country and the harassing mode of warfare adopted by his adversaries. His arms met with various fortune; but on the whole his forces proved superior to those of the enemy. He led a successful expedition in the Hijâz, and, after concluding a treaty with the Wahhâbee chief, ’Abd-Allah, in 1815, he returned to Egypt on hearing of the escape of Napoleon from Elba.

He now confiscated the lands belonging to private individuals, merely allowing them a pension for life, and attempted to introduce the European system of military tactics. A formidable mutiny, however, broke out in the metropolis, the pasha’s life was endangered, and he sought refuge by night in the citadel, while the soldiery committed many acts of plunder. The revolt was reduced by presents to the chiefs of the insurgents, and Mehemet Ali very honourably ordered that the sufferers by the late disturbances should receive compensation from the treasury. The project of the “Nizâm Gedeed,” as the European system is called in Egypt, was, in consequence of this commotion, abandoned for a time,

Soon after Toosoon returned to Egypt, but Mehemet Ali, dissatisfied with the treaty which had been concluded with the Wahhâbees, and with the non-fulfilment of certain of its clauses, determined to send another army to Arabia, and to include in it the soldiers who had recently proved unruly. This expedition, under Ibrahim Pasha, left in the autumn of 1816. After several unimportant advantages, Ibrahim sat down before the town of Er-Rass; but three months’ exertions proving unavailing, he raised the siege, with the loss of nearly half his army. Notwithstanding, he advanced on the capital, Ed-Dir’eeyeh, by slow but sure steps. The last place before reaching that city offered a brave resistance, and Ibrahim, in revenge, caused all its inhabitants to be put to the sword, except a number of women and children, the former of whom were spared not from motives of pity. Ed-Dir’eeyeh fell after a five months’ siege, in the course of which an explosion destroyed the whole of the besiegers’ powder; aud had the Wahhâbees been aware of the extent of the disaster, few, we may believe, would have escaped to tell the tale. ’Abd-Allah, their chief, was taken, and with his treasurer and secretary was sent to Constantinople, where, in spite of Ibrahim’s promise of safety, and of Mehemet Ali’s intercession in their favour, they were paraded and put to death. At the close of the year 1819, Ibrahim returned to Cairo, having conquered all present opposition in Arabia, but without having broken the spirit of the Wahhâbees.
[9:7:765]

The pasha, since his return from Arabia, had turned his attention to the improvement of the manufactures of Egypt, and engaged very largely in commerce. The results of these attempts are stated in other places, but the important work of digging the new canal of Alexandria, called the Mahmoodeeyeh, must here be again mentioned. The old canal had long fallen into decay, and the necessity of a safe channel between Alexandria and the Nile was much felt. Such was the object of the canal then excavated, and it has on the whole well answered its purpose; but the sacrifice of life was enormous, and the labour of the unhappy fellâhs was forced. Towards the accomplishment of a favourite project, the formation of the Nizam Gedeed, a force was ordered to the southern frontier of Egypt, and the conquest of Sennâr was contemplated in order to get rid of the disaffected troops, and to obtain a sufficient number of captives to form the nucleus of the new army. The forces destined for this service were led by Ismail, then the youngest son of Mehemet Ali; they consisted of between 4000 and 5000 men, Turks and Arabs, and were despatched in the summer of 1820. Nubia at once submitted, the Shageeyeb Arabs immediately beyond the province of Dongola were worsted, and Senuâr was reduced without a battle. Mohammad Bey, the defterdär, with another force of about the same strength, was then sent by Mehemet Ali against Kurdufân with a like result, but not without a hard fought engagement. In 1822 Ismail was, with his retinue, put to death by an Arab chieftain named Nimr; and the defterdär, a man infamous fur his cruelty, assumed the command in those provinces, and exacted terrible retribution from the innocent inhabitants.

In the years 1821 and 1822 Mehemet Ali despatched both ships and men (the latter about 7000 or 8000 Albanians and Turks) to the Morea, Cyprus, and Candia, to aid the Porte in reducing the Greek insurrection; and he continued to take part in that struggle, his fleet being engaged at Navarino, until the English insisted on the evacuation of the Morea in 1828 by Ibrahim Pasha. In 1822 an army of disciplined troops was at length organized: 8000 men (chiefly slaves, from Sennâr and Kurdufân) were trained by French officers at Aswan. Of the vast numbers seized in the countries above named, many died on the way; those who were not eligible were, with the women, sold in Cairo, and in the remainder were incorporated many fellahs. Colonel Sèves (Suleymân Pasha), a Frenchman who after wards became a Moslem, superintended their organization; great numbers of the blacks died, but the Egyptians proved very good troops. Many thousands were pressed in consequence, and they now constitute the bulk of the army. In 1823 the new conscripts amounted to 24,000 men, composing six regiments of infantry, each regiment consisting of five battalions of 800 men, and the battalions of eight companies of 100 men.

In 1824 a native rebellion of a religious character broke out in Upper Egypt, headed by one Ahmad, an inhabitant of Es-Sâlimeeyeh, a village situate a few miles above Thebes. He proclaimed himself a prophet, and was soon followed by between 20,000 and 30,000 insurgents, mostly peasants, but some deserters from the Nizam, for that force was yet in a half-organized state and in part declared for the impostor. The insurrection was crushed by Mehemet Ali, and about one-fourth of Ahmad’s followers perished, but he himself escaped and was never after heard of. Few of these unfortunates possessed any other weapon than the long staff (nebboot) of the Egyptian peasant; still they offered an obstinate resistance, and the combat resembled a massacre. In the same year war was once more made on the Wahhâbees, who had collected in considerable numbers. The 2d regiment was sent on this service, and it behaved in a very creditable manner.

But the events of the war with the Porte are perhaps the most important of the life of Mehemet Ali. The campaign of 1831 had ostensibly for its object the castigation of ’Abd-Allah, pasha of Acre; the invading force consisted of six regiments of infantry, four of cavalry, four field-pieces, and a greater number of siege-guns, the whole under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, while the fleet, conveying provisions, ammunition, Ac., was to accompany the army by sea. The terrible cholera of 1831, however, stayed the expedition when it was on the eve of departing; 5000 of its number died, and it was not until early in October of the same year that it started. Little opposition was encountered on the way to Acre, whither Ibrahim had gone by sea, and that place was invested on the 29th of November. The artillery of the besieged was well served; an assault in the following February was repulsed,, and the cold and rain of a Syrian winter severely tried the Egyptian troops. A second assault in like manner failed, and Ibrahim was called away to repel Osmân Pasha, governor of Aleppo. The latter, however, hastily decamped without giving him battle, and Ibrahim, deeming this advantage sufficient, retraced his steps towards Acre. He then pushed the siege with fresh vigour, and stormed the city on the 27 th of May; 1400 men fell in the breach, and the garrison was found to be reduced to about 400 men. The fall of Acre was followed by negotiation. Mehemet Ali evinced a disposition for peace, but demanded the government of Syria, and the Porte, in consequence, denounced him as a traitor. On his part, Ibrahim pushed his successes; Damascus was evacuated at his approach, and the battle of Hirns, fought on the 8th of July 1832, decided the superiority of the Egyptian army, and the advantage of disciplined troops over an irregular force, although very disproportionate in numbers. The enemy composed the advanced guard of the Turkish army, 30,000 strong, and the Egyptians numbered only 16,000 men.

Alter this victory, Ibrahim marched to Hamâh, and thence to Aleppo (which had just before closed its gates against the Turkish general-in-chief, Hoseyn Pasha, whose troops became rapidly disorganized), forced the defiles of Beykin, and pursued the fugitive Turks to Adaneh. About the same time an Egyptian squadron had chased the sultan’s fleet into Constantinople. Diplomacy was, at this point, again resorted to, but without any result; the sultan depended on his fleet to protect the capital, and determined to risk another engagement with the victorious enemy. The charge of this venture was intrusted to Resheed Pasha, the grand vizir. In the meantime, Ibrahim Pasha had gained the pass of Taurus, and having beaten the Turks at Oulou-Kislâk, he hesitated not to give battle to Resheed Pasha at the head of about 60,000 men, his own army being less than half that strength; the battle of Kooniyeh,on the plains of Anatolia, proved utterly disastrous to the Porte; in the confusion of the fight, and the darkness of a thick day, the grand vizir was made prisoner, his army routed, and Constantinople was within six marches of the victor, without an army to oppose his passage. The capital of the Ottoman Empire, in imminent danger by sea and land, was then intrusted to the keeping of its hereditary enemy, as the last resource of the sultan Mahmood, and a Russian fleet and army were sent thither. Negotiations were in cousequence opened, and on the 14th of May 1833 a treaty was concluded between Mehemet Ali and the Porte, by which the whole of Syria and the district of Adaneh were ceded to the former, on condition of his paying tribute. With this terminated the war, but not the animosity of the sultan. Ibrahim, by excessive firmness and rigour, speedily restored security and tranquillity to the greater part of Syria; but some years later, the attempt of Mahmood to get the better· of his vassal, and the consequent [9:7:766] disaster experienced by his arms at Nezeeb, entailed fresh complications, and the interference of Great Britain ended in the restoration of Syria to the Porte in 1841. Mehemet Ali had placed all his reliance on the co-operation of France, and to its desertion of his cause, and his confidence in its assistance, either moral or material, must be ascribed the unfortunate issue of the war. That the Syrians, in general, preferred the rule of Mehemet Ali to the tyranny of pashas appointed from Constantinople may be safely averred; but we cannot close this account of his possession of that province without animadverting on the horrible cruelties perpetrated by Ibrahim Pasha, or warning our readers not to give credence to the unmeasured praise bestowed by many on the Egyptian troops there engaged. Conceding that they were superior soldiers to the Turks, it must be borne in mind that they were veterans, disciplined and led by the French officers and an able general; their opponents were destitute of any European discipline, badly officered, and discouraged by the disasters in Greece. It has, moreover, been stated on good authority, that Ibrahim owed much of his success to the placing of artillery in the rear of his troops, with orders to fire on them should they show symptoms of wavering.

After the peace of 1841 Mehemet Ali gave up all great political projects, and solely occupied himself in improvements, real or imaginary, in Egypt. He continued to prosecute his commercial speculations, and manufacturing, educational, and other schemes. The barrage of the Nile, still uncompleted, was commenced by his direction, and in 1847 he visited Constantinople, where he received the rank of vizir. In the year 1848, however, symptoms of imbecility appeared; and after a short space Ibrahim was declared his successor, but died after a brief reign of two months.

Mehemet Ali survived Ibrahim, and died on the 3d of August 1849. Many and conflicting have been the opinions entertained of this remarkable man, for such at least all acknowledge him to have been. His massacre of the Memlooks has been the great point of attack by his enemies; but that, as well as many of his other acts, must be ascribed to his boundless ambition, not to innate cruelty; for he proved himself to be averse to unnecessary bloodshed. That he really esteemed European civilization may be doubted; but his intelligent mind could not fail to perceive that therein lay his great strength, and of this he availed himself with consummate ability. To his firm government Egypt is indebted for the profound tranquillity which it has long been its good fortune to enjoy. A traveller of any nation oi∙ faith may traverse it in its length and breadth with greater safety than almost any other country out of Western Europe; and the display of fanaticism has been rigorously punished. While, however, Egypt has benefited by the establishment of order, the people have suffered most severe exactions. The confiscation of private lands has been before mentioned; to that arbitrary act must be added the seizure of the lands of the mosques, the imposition of heavy taxation, and a system of merciless impressment. In fact, the condition of the Egyptian fell.4h has rarely been as wretched as it is at the present day. Mehemet Ali also misunderstood the real resources of Egypt, which are certainly agricultural; he dealt a severe blow to native produce by endeavouring to encourage manufacturing industry, and by establishing enormous Government monopolies, a measure which crushed the spirit of the agriculturists. His military and governing abilities were assuredly very great, and his career is almost unequalled in Turkish history. Had it not been for the intervention of Great Britain, his Syrian successes over the Porte would probably have rescued Egypt from the wretched condition of a Turkish province. But the firm<∙in of 1841 entailed the loss of all his military power, the army was reduced to 18,000 men, and the navy condemned to rot in the harbour of Alexandria; while Mehemet Ali, failing to gain the great object of his ambition, the establishment of an independent dynasty, and being compelled to look on his then living family as his only heirs, thenceforth confined himself to measures of less importance, and did not prosecute even these with his former energy.

The entire constitution of the government of Egypt is the work of Mehemet Ali. With a few exceptions, he destroyed all former usages, and introduced a system partly derived from European models. The army and navy are of his creation, so are the taxation, the regulation of import and export duties, &c., quarantine laws, the manufactories, colleges, and the ministry. Some of these institutions are useful, others both vexatious and ill-calculated for the country. The colleges of languages and medicine, and the printing-press at Boolâk, are among the former, and are exceedingly praiseworthy efforts in a right direction; and in the same category must be placed many minor improvements, in which Mehemet Ali showed himself to be far in advance of his countrymen; while, weighing his chequered life and numerous disadvantages of position and nation, his moral character, enlightened mind, and distinguished ability must place him high among the great men of modern times.^[60. The Dynasty of Mehemet Ali.]

Ibrahim was succeeded by his nephew ’Abbas, son of Toosoon. This miserable voluptuary, and withal bigoted though ignorant Muslim, utterly neglected the affairs of government and solely consulted his own gratification. During bis reign all the great works begun by Mehemet Ali were suspended. It was a time of deliberate retrogression, and his sudden death in July 1854 was welcomed by all true Egyptians as the removal of the country’s curse. His successor, Said Pasha, the fourth son of Mehemet Ali, endeavoured to pursue his great father’s policy and to carry out his aims. He had not, however, the strength of character or the health needed to meet the serious difficulties of the task, and he will chiefly be remembered for the abolition of some of the more grinding Government monopolies, and for the concession of the Suez Canal. It was reserved for his nephew, the present khedive, to attain all and more than all that Mehemet Ali had designed for his country.

The reign of Ismail promises to be the beginning of a new era for Egypt. A man of undoubted ability, possessed of unusual energy in administration, fully appreciative of the importance of Western civilization, fired with the ambition proper to a grandson of Mehemet Ali, the khedive is a ruler such as Egypt has scarcely seen since the Arab conquest. His first step was to remove, as far as possible, the irksome control of the Porte. At great cost he obtained an imperial firman in 186G, removing almost all the old treaty restrictions, granting him the title of khedive [9:7:767] (pron. khedeev), and settling the succession on the eldest son; and in 1872 another firm<4n made him virtually an independent sovereign.

Having thus obtained for himself and his dynasty a settled regal rank, Ismail turned his attention homewards, and began a series of reforms such as no previous governor of Egypt ever contemplated. He re-established and improved the administrative system organized by Mehemet Ali, and which had fallen into decay under 'Abbâs’s indolent rule; he caused a thorough remodelling of the customs system, which was in an anarchic state, to be made by English officials; in 1865 he bought the Egyptian post-office, and placed it under the direction, with full powers, of an official from St Martin’s le Grand, who has brought it into admirable working order; he reorganized the military schools of his grandfather, and lent his willing support to the cause of education in every way. Public works have largely engaged the attention of the khedive. Railways, telegraphs, lighthouses, the harbour works at Suez, the breakwater at Alexandria, have been carried out under his personal auspices by some of the best contractors of Europe. If there is a fault to be found in this Europeanizing of Egypt, it is that the practical zeal for modern civilization leaves no room for the honourable respect due to the unique antiquities of the country. It is true that ancient Egypt is protected by the care of Mariette Bey, but the art of the Arabs is suffered to decay, nay, is even purposely demolished, to make room for modern French gewgaws. A recent writer tells us that a new street cuts through about a mile of the “old Arab rookeries,” and gravely advances the opinion that the opera house and the public gardens and the other meretricious abominations that have been set up in Cairo are worthy of a second class European city! Still, terrible as is the vandalism now going on in Egypt, there can be little doubt that the present policy of the khedive will add greatly to the prosperity and health of the people. At the same time, future generations will gain at the fearful expense of the present. The funds required for these public works, as well as the actual labour, have been remorselessly extorted from a poverty-stricken population; and there is probably no peasant now existing whose condition is w orse than that of the long-suffering Egyptian fellàh.

One of the greatest reforms that Egypt owes to its present ruler is the abolition of the old system of consular jurisdiction, and the substitution of mixed courts, where European and native judges sit together to try all mixed cases without respect to nationality. These courts were established in 1876 on the suggestion of the wisest of Egypt’s statesmen, Nubar Pasha, and on the recommendation of an international commission. A code based on the Muhammadan law and the Code Napoléon has been drawn up, which seems thoroughly suited to the needs of the position; and the best results may be looked for from this reform. It were greatly to be desired that the jurisdiction of these courts should be extended so as eventually to supersede the old native system. At present they only take the place of the consular courts.

In recent times the khedive has annexed a large territory to the south of Khartoom, now extending about as far as Gondokoro, and which will doubtless shortly include the lakes of Victoria and Albert Nyanza. The expedition was at first commanded by Sir Samuel Baker, with very unsatisfactory results; and great relief was felt when the continuation of the work of conquest was intrusted to Colonel Gordon, an officer in whose character and ability the fullest confidence is placed. The khedive has professed himself anxious to put down the Nile slave-trade, and that he is really desirous of seeing the traffic ended is shown by the full powers he has given Colonel Gordon for the suppression of it in the heart of the slave-country. What the result will be it is hard to foretell; but the good faith of the khedive and the determination of Colonel Gordon are now beyond a doubt. Quite recently (Aug, 14, 1877) a convention between the British and Egyptian Governments for the suppression of the slave-trade has been signed, imposing stringent penalties on the importation of slaves into Egypt, and extending the power of search in the case of suspected vessels.

Altogether it may be believed that a better time is beginning for Egypt (e.s.p.—s.l,p.)] topography and monuments. ^[61. The following account of the topography and monuments of Egypt is mainly based on Mr Lane’s MS. “Description of Egypt,” which the writer of this article used as his guide to the monuments during his residence in that country.]

The northern coast of Egypt is low and barren, presenting no features of interest, and affording no indication of the character of the country which it bounds. It is a barrier, generally of sand-hills, but sometimes of rock, for the most part wholly destitute of vegetation, except where grow a few wild and stunted date-palms. Immediately behind are desolate marshy tracts or extensive salt lakes, and beyond, the fertile country. The last is a wide plain, intersected by the two branches of the Nile, and by many canals, of which some were anciently branches of the river, and having a soil of great richness, though in this particular it is excelled by the valley above. The only inequalities of the surface are the mounds of ancient towns, and those, often if not always ancient, on which stand the modern towns and villages. The palm-trees are less numerous, and not so beautiful as in the more southern part of the country, but other trees are more common. The houses and huts of the towns and villages are of burnt brick near the Mediterranean; but as the climate becomes drier, and the occurrence of rain far less frequent, the use of crude brick obtains, until near the point of the Delta it is very general. The mosques even of the towns are rarely remarkable for architectural beauty in the tract to the north of Cairo. The palaces or villas of the Turkish grandees, which are not uncommon, have, however, a light and picturesque appearance, though their style is not good. The deserts which inclose the plain on both sides are rocky tracts of very slight elevation, having their surface overspread with sand and other debris.

Of the towns on the northern coast, the most western, Alexandria, called by the natives El-Iskendereeyeh, is the largest and the most important. It was founded in the year B.c. 332 by Alexander the Great, who gave it the form of a Macedonian mantle (chlamys). The ancient city occupied the space between the sea and Lake Mareotis, being about four miles in its greatest length, and a little less than a mile in its greatest breadth. The island of Pharos was likewise inhabited, and was joined to the continent by the mole called the Heptastadium. The Heptastadium and the island divided the bay into two harbours. These were spacious, and although the western, anciently called Portus Eunosti, but now the Old Port, is difficult to enter, and the eastern, Magnus Portus, or the New Port, is not so deep and is less secure, they are, except Port Said, by far the best anchorages on this coast of Egypt.

Alexandria, which partly occupied the site of the ancient Rhacotis, a place of little importance, naturally speedily increased in consequence, and became the emporium of the trade between Europe, Arabia, and India. After the death of Alexander the city became the capital of the Ptolemies. By the Ptolemies Alexandria was adorned with palaces and [9:7:768] of great magnificence, for which they did not scruple to despoil more ancient edifices of some of their chiefest ornaments. While its commercial importance increased, it became a celebrated seat of learning, with the greatest library of antiquity, through the wise interest with which the Greek kings regarded science and letters. Under the Ptolemies, however, the inhabitants, who were chiefly Greeks, became very troublesome to their rulers, like most commercial populations, and their turbulence was ill restrained by the weakness of the later sovereigns of that line. From the time of the Roman conquest, b.c. 30, until it was taken by the Arabs, λ.d. 641, Alexandria sensibly declined, partly in consequence of its being a provincial capital, instead of a royal residence, but chiefly because of the unruly disposition of its inhabitants, and their violent religious and political disputes, which at last resulted in the seat of government being transferred to the fortress of Egyptian Babylon, near the modern Cairo, which became in some sort the capital. During this period it had been distinguished for the learning of its ecclesiastics, and the strong part which they took in the theological differences of the early church. Under the Muslims Alexandria never regained the position of metropolis of Egypt, and its importance, with some fluctuations, waned until the discovery and consequent adoption of the route to India by the Cape of Good Hope almost withdrew the main cause of its prosperity. Recently, however, the resumption of the overland route has greatly benefited this city, and although it was not made the capital, it became the favourite residence of Mehemet Ali, which in like manner contributed to its welfare.

The older part of the town of Alexandria stands upon the Heptastadium, now much wider than it was anciently; but the recent part, where are the houses of the European merchants, occupies the site of a portion of the ancient city, •which was nearest to the mole. The most striking edifice is the castle on the island of Pharos, containing a lighthouse, which has succeeded to the more famous Pharos of antiquity. Here also is the pasha’s palace, as well as a lesser Pharos. The houses of the town are built of stone, or have their lowest story cased with that material, and the portion above built of brick plastered and whitewashed. The residences of the European merchants and consuls and the richer Turks and natives are spacious and well-built, somewhat in the modern Italian style, but have no claims to architectural beauty. The mosques are not remarkable, but the English church will, if ever completed, be a great ornament to the town. The population of the town is estimated at over 200,000. One of the favourite projects of Mehemet Ali was the fortification of Alexandria, which has been thus rendered so strong that if well garrisoned it could not be invested by a force of less than about 40,000 men.

The ancient remaihs are very scanty and of little interest, compared to those which are seen on the sites of other Egyptian towns. Two objects are conspicuous, one of the obelisks commonly called “Cleopatra’s Needles,” and the great column known aβ “Pompey’s Pillar.” The former is a fine obelisk of red granite nearly 70 feet in height, bearing hieroglyphic inscriptions with the names of Thothmes III., Ramses IL, and a later king. Beside it was a fallen obelisk of the same dimensions, its fellow, now (Oct. 1877) on its way to England. They were brought here from some ancient temple during the Roman rule. Pompey’s Pillar is in like manner of red granite, and its shaft is about 70 feet high, the whole column being nearly 100 feet in height. Its pedestal bears a Greek inscription in honour of the emperor Diocletian.

Proceeding to the east of Alexandria, the first place of importance is Er-Rasheed, called by the Europeans Rosetta, a considerable town on the west bank of the Rosetta branch of the Nile, anciently the Bolbitine. Before the cutting by Mehemet Ali of the Mahmoodeeyeh Canal to connect Alexandria with this branch of the river, Rosetta was a place of greater importance than now, as in consequence of the decay of the old canal of Alexandria, the overland trade from India chiefly passed through it. It is a well-built town, having some gardens, and is in many respects more agreeable than Alexandria. Its population is stated to be 15,000. A little to the north of the town is the boghâz, a bar of sand stretching across the mouth of the river, and rendering it often impassable; and between it and Rosetta is an old fort called Fort St Julien by the French, who repaired it during their occupation of Egypt, when one of their officers discovered the Rosetta Stone, the famous trilingual tablet which afforded the clue by which hieroglyphics were interpreted.

In ascending the Rosetta branch, the first place of interest is the site of Sais, saï, on the eastern bank, marked by lofty mounds, and the remains of massive walls of crude brick, which were those of a great inclosure in which the chief temple and doubtless other sacred edifices stood. The goddess Nit or Neith was the divinity of the place, and a great festival was annually hekl here in her honour, to which pilgrims resorted from other parts of Egypt. Sals was remarkable for the learning of its priests, and was the royal residence of the Salte kings (Dynasties XXIV., XXVI.) A modern village here is called “Sà-el-Hagar,” or “Sals of the Stone,” a name which perhaps alludes to the famous monolith described by Herodotus.

In the interior of the modern Delta no remains of importance have been discovered, though there are many ancient sites marked by mounds. The chief towns are El-Mahalleh el-Kebeereh, not far from the Damietta brauch, about forty miles from the sea; Tantà, nearly in the middle of the Delta; and Manoof, farther south. Of these Tantà is best known as the birth-place of a Muslim saint, the seyyid Ahmad El-Bedawee, in whose honour three festivals are annually kept, the greatest of which attracts more pilgrims than any other in Egypt, and is in this respect second alone to the pilgrimage to Mecca. The festivals of Tantà are rather distinguished by riot than piety, and recall the revelries of Bubastis and Canopus.

Several places of interest are found on the course of the Damietta branch, the old Phatnitic or Pathmetic. First of these is the town whence it takes its name, Dimyât, called by the Europeans Damietta, which stands not far from the mouth of the branch, on its eastern side. In the time of the crusades it was a strong place, and regarded as the key of Egypt. It was taken and retaken by the contending forces, and formed the. basis of the operations of St Louis in the unfortunate eighth crusade. Shortly afterwards the sultan Edh-Dhàhir Beybars, in a.d. 1251, razed it and rebuilt it on the present site somewhat farther from the sea. It is a flourishing town, and has a population of 29,000 inhabitants. The next place of importance is the town of El-Mansoorah, founded by El-Melik El-Kâmil, the nephew of Saladin, during the sixth crusade, to commemorate, as its name imports, his success over the invading army of Jean de Brienne. A little to the south of El-Mansoorah, on the opposite or western bank, at a short distance from the river, are the remains of a very remarkable temple of the goddess Isis, and the mounds of the town of Iseum. Although the temple is entirely thrown down, as though by a natural convulsion, but probably by human violence, its plan may be partly traced and its date ascertained, as the materials have not been removed. It was, unlike most Egyptian temples, built altogether of granite, and was about 600 feet in length and 200 in breadth. The materials must have been transported [9:7:769] from Syene, a distance by the river, on which they were doubtless floated, of more than 600 miles. Bearing in mind this circumstance, and the difficulty of both working and sculpturing so hard a material, this temple must be considered to be one of the most costly in the country. The earliest name which has been found here is that of Nekht-har-heb (Dynasty XXX. ), but the most common one is that of Ptolemy Philadelphus. A little to the south of this site, on the same bank, is the small town of Semennood, anciently Sebennytus; and a short distance farther, on the same side, is the village of Aboo-Seer, the ancient Busiris, named after Osiris, who, with Isis, was here worshipped. Herodotus mentions among the great festivals that of Isis held at Busiris, but this was more probably kept at Iseum, which was not far. For a long distance there is nothing of interest until we reach Tel-Atreeb, where the site of the town of Athribis is marked by high mounds, with remains of ancient houses and some blocks of stone.

To the eastward of the Damietta branch, in the broad cultivated tract or the desert beyond, are some places worthy of note. The most eastern of these is the site of Pelusium, which was, in the times of the Pharaohs of Dynasty XXVI., the key of Egypt towards Palestine. No important remains have been discovered here. Between this site and the Damietta branch are the mounds of Tanis, or Zoan, z’an, zar, where are considerable remains of the great temple, the most remarkable of which are several fallen obelisks, some of which are broken. From their inscriptions, and those of other blocks, it has been ascertained that the temple was as ancient as the time of Dynasty XII., and -was much beautified by Ramses II. and other kings of that time and the subsequent period. Tanis was on the eastern bank of the Tanitic branch of the Nile, now called the Canal of the El-Mo’izz. On the same side of the same branch, but far to the south, was the city of Bubastis, pe-bast, the site of which is indicated by very lofty mounds, in which may be traced the remains of its great temple, which was entirely of red granite. Here was held the festival of the goddess Bast, or Bubastis, which attracted great crowds of pilgrims, and is ranked by Herodotus first of the festivals of Egypt. Not far south, and on the borders of the desert, is Bilbeys, which was a place of some importance as a frontier-town in the time of the Eiyoobee princes. Still farther south are the mounds of Onion, the Jewish city founded by the high priest Onias, where was a temple closed by Vespasian not long after the overthrow of Jerusalem. The site is called Tell-el-Yahoodeeyeh, or “The Mound of the Jewess.”

At the point of the Delta is the unfinished barrage, which, by crossing both branches of the river, will regulate the inundation above and below this point. The river here becomes broader than in its divided state, and long continues so. A little south of the point of the Delta, on the eastern bank of the river, near the village of El-Matareeyeh, not far north of Cairo, is the site of the ancient Heliopolis, or On, an, the City of the Sun, marked by a solitary obelisk, and crude brick ridges formed by the ruins of a massive wall. The obelisk bears the name of Usurtesen I., the second king of Dynasty XII., in the simple inscription which runs down each of its sides. It is of red granite, and nearly 70 feet in height. The city was famous rather for the learning of its college than for its size, and the temple of the sun was held in high veneration. Many famous Greek philosophers studied here, and much of their earliest knowledge of natural science was no doubt derived from their Egyptian instructors.

Boolâk, the port of Cairo, is a flourishing town, having two remarkable mosques. It was built a.h. 713, in the reign of the sultan Mohammad Ibn Kalâ-oon. Here M. Mariette has founded the national “Musée Boulaq,” a splendid collection of Egyptian antiquities.

Cairo is the fourth Muslim capital of Egypt; the site of one of those that have preceded it is, for the most part, included within its walls, while the other two were a little to the south. ’Amr, the Muslim conqueror of the country, founded El-Fustât, the oldest of these, close to the fortress of Egyptian Babylon, the seat of government at that time. Its name signifies “the Tent,” as it was built where ’Amr had pitched his tent. The new town speedily became a place of importance, and vas the residence of the Nâïbs, or lieutenants, appointed by the orthodox and Ommiade caliphs. It received the name of Masr, properly Misr, which was also applied by the Arabs to Memphis and to Cairo. It declined after the foundation of El-Kâhireh, but never became altogether deserted, for a small town, called Masr El-’Ateekah, or “Old Masr,” occupies, in the present day, part of what was its area in its time of prosperity. Shortly after the overthrow of the Ommiade Dynasty, and the establishment of the ’Abbâsee, the city of El-’Askar was founded (a.h. 133) by Suleymân, the general who subjugated the country, and became the capital and the residence of the successive lieutenants of the ’Abbâsee caliphs. El- ’Askar was a small town adjacent to El-Fustât, of which it was a kind of suburb. Its site is now entirely desolate. The third capital, El-Katâë’, or El-Katâyë’, was founded about a.h. 2GO, by Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon, as his capital. It continued the royal residence of his successors; but not long after the fall of the dynasty, and the subsequent Ikhsheedees, the seat of government was transferred by the Fâtimees to a new city, El-Kâhireh. El-Katâë’, which had been sacked on the overthrow of the Tooloonees, rapidly decayed. A part of the present Cairo occupies its site, and contains its great mosque, that of Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon.

Gôhar el-Kâïd, the conqueror of Egypt for the Fâtimee caliph El-Mo’izz, founded a new capital, a.h. 358, which waβ named El-Kâhireh, that is, “the Victorious,” a name corrupted into Cairo. This town occupied about a fourth part, the north-eastern, of the present metropolis. By degrees it became greater than El-Fustât, and took from it the name of Misr, or Masr, which is applied to it by the modern Egyptians. It continually increased, so as to include the site of El-Katâë’ to the south, and of the old town of El-Maks to the west. The famous Saladin built the Citadel on the lowest point of the mountain to the east, which immediately overlooked El-Katâë’, and he partly walled round the towns and large gardens within the space now called Cairo. Under the prosperous rule of the Memlook sultans this great tract was filled with habitations; a large suburb to the north, the Hoseyneeyeh, was added; and the town of Boolâk was founded. After the Turkish conquest (a.d. 1517) the metropolis decayed, but its limits were the same; with the present dynasty it has somewhat recovered.

Cairo is of an irregular oblong form. Its greatest length is about three miles, and its average breadth about a mile and a half, and its dimensions do not fall very much short of these in any part. M. Jacotin {Description de VTjgypte i xviii. ii. Ill) estimates the superficies of Cairo at 793 hectares, or about 3 square miles. This surface is not, however, entirely occupied by houses, for it contains the Citadel and various extensive gardens and open spaces, as well as lakes. Most of the streets are extremely narrow, and the markets generally crowded, so that the stranger usually acquires a delusive idea of the density of the population. Mr Lane states the population to have been 240,000 before the great plague of 1835, and adds that the deficiency, equal to not less than one-third of the inhabitants, caused by that terrible visitation, would be speedily supplied from the villages. {Modern Egyptians, Introduction[9:7:770].) Sir Gardner Wilkinson, in his Modem Egypt and Thebes (i. 256), published in 1843, gives the population at about 200,000; and Mrs Poole, writing in 1842, estimates it at about 240,000 (Englishwoman in Egypt, i. 136); but Clot-Bey (Aperçu General, i. 204), whose work appeared in 1840, states the much higher amount of about 300,000 souls. The census of 1847-8 states the more moderate number of 253,541 inhabitants, and in this instance it is not likely to have been far wrong. We may fairly suppose that during the time of comparative prosperity that followed the great plague of 1835, the population gradually increased to about 250,000, and that the cholera in 1848, and the conscriptions occasioned by the Crimean War, somewhat diminished its amount, which in the subsequent time of peace rose to the present sum of about 350,000. Of the population of 240,000, in Mr Lane’s estimate, about 190,000 were Muslim Egyptians, about 10,000 Copts, 3000 or 4000 Jews, and the rest, strangers from various countries. The adult male population was about one-third of the whole, or 80,000 persons, of whom 30,000 were merchants, petty shopkeepers, and artisans, 20,000 domestic servants, and 15,000 common labourers, porters, &c.; the remainder chiefly consisting of military and civil servants of the Government. (Modem Egyptians, l. c.)

Cairo is still the most remarkable and characteristic of Arab cities. The beauty of its religious and domestic architecture, before the recent innovations, is unexcelled elsewhere. The edifices raised by the Moorish kings of Spain and the Muslim rulers of India may have been more splendid in their materials, and more elaborate in their details; the houses of the great men of Damascus may be more costly than were those of the Memlook beys; but for purity of taste and elegance of design both are far excelled by many of the mosques and houses of Cairo. These mosques have suffered much in the beauty of their appearance from the effects of time and neglect; but their colour has been often thus softened, and their outlines rendered the more picturesque. What is most to be admired in their style of architecture is its extraordinary freedom from restraint, shown in the wonderful variety of its forms, and the skill in design which has made the most intricate details to harmonize with grand outlines. Here the student may best learn the history of Arab art. Like its contemporary Gothic, it has three great periods, those of growth, maturity, and decline. Of the first, the mosque of Ahmad Ibn-Tooloon in the southern part of Cairo, and the three great gates of El-Kahireh (the old city), the Bab-en-Nasr, Bab-el-Futooh, and Bab-Zuweyleh, are splendid examples. The leading forms are simple and massive, with in the mosque horse-shoe arches. The decoration is in friezes, and its details of conventionalized foliage. The second period passes from the highest point to which this art attained to a luxuriance promising decay. The mosque of Sultan Hasan, below the Citadel, those of Mueiyad and Kalâ-oon, with the Barkookeyeh, in the main street of the old city, and the mosque of Barkook in the Cemetery of Kâït Bey, are instances of the earlier and best style of this period. The forms, though still massive, are less simple, and they are admirably adapted to the necessities of space. The decoration is in conventionalized foliage of the most free forms, balanced by exquisite geometrical patterns. Of the last style of this period, the Ghooreeyeh, iu the main street of the old city, and the mosque of Kilt Bey in his cemetery, are beautiful specimens. They show an elongation of forms and an excess of decoration in which the florid qualities predominate. Of the age of decline the finest monument is the mosque of Mohammad Bey Aboo-Dahab, in the old city. The forms are now poor, though not lacking in grandeur, and the details are not as well adjusted as before, with a want of mastery of the most suitable decoration. The usual plau of a congregational mosque is a large, square, open court, surrounded by colonnades, of which the chief, often with more rows of columns, faces Mecca (eastward), and has inside its outer wall a decorated niche to mark the direction of prayer. In the centre is a fountain for ablutions, often surmounted by a dome, and in the eastern colonnade a pulpit and a desk for readers. When a mosque is also the founder’s tomb, it has a richly ornamented sepulchral chamber. Of domestic architecture there are a few precious fragments before the age of decline; but most specimens are of the latest period of that age. These are marked by a singular fitness and great elegance in the interiors. The decoration, though inferior to that of the mosques of the best style, is charming for variety and beauty of pattern. See Cairo, and also Architecture, vol. ii. pp. 445-44.

To the east of Cairo is a bold spur of the mountains known as El-Gebel El-Mukattam. Beneath it, and to the north of the Citadel, is the Cemetery of Kâït Bey, remarkable for the splendid tombs of the Memlook sultans. The most beautiful of these is that of Kàït Bey, from which the cemetery takes its name, but those of the sultan Barkook and of El-Ghooree must not be passed by unmentioned. At a little distance to the north-east is the Gebel-el-Ahmar, or “Red Mountain,” and southward of this, petrified wood in large quantities is seen strewn on the surface of the desert. The space between Cairo and the Nile, varying from a mile to a mile and a half in breadth, is occupied by plantations which were made by Ibrahim Pasha during Ids father’s rule. Formerly this side of the city was, as the other three are still partially, bounded by lofty mounds of rubbish; these he caused to be removed, and by doing so conferred a great benefit upon the inhabitants, as well as by planting with trees the intervening space. By irrigating this tract very freely with a steam-engine he considerably lessened the good he had effected, rendering the western part of the city somewhat damp. To t·he south of Cairo is a great cemetery containing the tomb of the Iraâm Esh-Shâfe’ee, and also an aqueduct, built by the sultan El-Ghooree, which conducts water from the Nile to the Citadel; and further south, the Roman fortress of Egyptian Babylon, now called Kasr-esh-Shema, at present chiefly occupied by a Coptic convent, as well as the small town of Masr El-’Ateekah, which is all that remains of the famous metropolis El-Fustàt. It contains no remarkable edifices: in its immediate neighbourhood, however, is the oldest mosque in Egypt, that of ’Amr, the Muslim conqueror, but it has been so frequently repaired and almost rebuilt that it is impossible to form any idea of its original appearance. Opposite to Masr El-’Ateekah, from which it is separated by a very narrow branch of the Nile, is the island of Er-Rôdah, containing the famous Mikyâs, or Nilomcter.

The chief place on the western bank near Cairo is the small town of El-Geezeh, opposite Masr El-’Ateekah. El-Geezeh is best known as having given its name to the most famous group of Pyramids, the chief monuments of Memphis, which stand on the slightly elevated border of the low Libyan range, not more than a quarter of a mile oeyond the limit of the cultivated land.

The city of Memphis, men-nofer, “the good station,” stood on the western bank of the Nile about ten miles above Cairo. It was founded by Menes, the first king of Egypt. The kings and people who dwelt there chose the nearest part of the desert as their burial-place, and built tombs on its rocky edge, or excavated them in its sides. The kings raised pyramids around which their subjects were buried in comparatively small sepulchres. The pyramids were grouped together, and often there is a long distauce from one group to another. Although many pyramids have been nearly or wholly destroyed, yet, as the largest undoubtedly[9:7:771] remain, the general features of the necropolis cannot be much changed. From the Citadel of Cairo we obtain a good view of the several groups. First, opposite to us, but a little to the south, are the three great Pyramids of El-Geezeh, two of which exceed all the others in magnitude; at some distance farther south we see those of Aboo-Seer, likewise three in number, of smaller dimensions, and, not so far beyond them, the great Pyramid of Sakkârah, called from its form that of Steps, with smaller pyramids in its neighbourhood. Farthest of all, after a wider interval, are the two large Pyramids of Dahshoor, which approach iu size the two great structures of El-Geezeh. There are more to the south as far as the Feiyoom, the last being that of El-Lahoon, but none above the Pyramids of Dahshoor can be included within the Memphite necropolis. That great tract extended, if we measure from the ruined Pyramid of Aboo-Ruweysh, somewhat to the north of those of El-Geezeh, to the southernmost Pyramid of Dahshoor, throughout a space of nearly twenty miles, in almost every part of which some sepulchres have been discovered, while it cannot be doubted that many more await a fortunate explorer.

The road to the pyramids of El-Geezeh from the town is through cultivated fields diversified by villages in palmgroves. As we approach them, these structures do not give us that idea of size that we had expected from our first distant view; and until we stand at their feet we do not appreciate their vastness. But as we endeavour to scan the height of the Great Pyramid, when about to begin its ascent, we fully realize a result that human labour has not achieved elsewhere. The very dimensions (a height of about half a thousand feet, four sides each measuring the seventh of a mile) are in themselves gigantic; but when we know that this huge space is almost solid, containing a few chambers so small as not to be worthy of consideration in calculating its contents, we discover that no monuments of man’s raising elsewhere afford any scale by which to estimate its greatness. The Pyramids, except one or more small ones, were tombs of kings. Each had its name and a priest attached to it, for whose functions there was a chapel at some distance in front of the entrance.

The Great Pyramid, “the Splendid,” was the mausoleum of Khufu, or Cheops, of Dynasty IV. The present perpendicular height of the structure is, according to General Vyse, 450 feet 9 inches, and the side of its present base 746 feet. It is about 30 feet lower than it was originally, in consequence of the casing stones and much of the outer masonry having been torn off; and its base is likewise smaller. General Vyse gives the former height at 480 feet 9 inches, and the side of the former base at 7 64 feet. Like all the other pyramids, it faces the cardinal points. At the completion of the pyramid the faces were smooth and polished, but now they present a series of great steps formed by the courses of stone, and are in some places (particularly in the middle of each face, and at the angles, and about the entrance) much broken. The ascent is easy though fatiguing, and the traveller is amply rewarded by the view which he obtains from the platform, about 32 feet square, at the summit. The prospect of the fertile plain and valley on the one side, and of the undulating barren surface of the Great Desert on the other, as well as of the pyramids and tombs beneath, is alike remarkable from its character and the associations which it calls up. The examination of the interior is no less interesting. All other tombs but the Memphite pyramids, and those which were simply pits, were not closed, the upper chamber being intended for the performance of funeral rites when the family of the deceased visited his sepulchre. These pyramids, however, were most carefully closed. The chambers which contained the bodies of the king, and of those (doubtless of his family) who were sometimes buried in the same structure, are without sculptures, and scarcely ornamented in any way, being usually wholly plain. The passages leading to them are only large enough to admit a sarcophagus, and after the king’s burial were closed by the lowering of heavy stone portcullises, and the blocking up of the entrance. The desired object was security, and we must not, therefore, expect beauty or grandeur in chambers constructed for this purpose, although we cannot fail to admire their massive and gloomy aspect.

The entrance of the Great Pyramid is not far from the middle of the northern face, 49 feet in perpendicular height from the base. The fallen stones and rubbish have, however, raised a mound which reaches nearly to the entrance, the masonry about which having been torn down, we gain some idea of the construction of the pyramid. In this manner the passage has lost somewhat of its length. The passage itself is 3 feet 11 inches high, and 3 feet 5⅜ inches wide, and is lined with fine limestone. It descends at an angle of 26° 4Γ.^[62. See Sir John Herschel’s “Observations on the Entrance Passages in the Pyramids of Gizeh,” in Vyse’s Pyramids of Gizeh, vol. ii. 107-109. The different angles of the entrance passages of other pyramids, and the circumstance that they were always closed at the completion of the buildings, show that the fact of this one’s having pointed, at a supposed date of its erection, to a Draconis, which wa then the pole-star, is not to be regarded as more than accidental. Nevertheless, as above mentioned, the pyramids face the cardinal points.] At a distance of 63 feet 2 inches from the beginning of the roof of the present entrance, α second passage commences from this, taking an ascending direction. The entrance of this new passage is obstructed by great blocks of granite which entirely fill it, and have been passed by mcaus of an excavation around them. We thus enter the ascending passage, which is of the same breadth and height as the former, and inclines at an angle of 26° 18'. The stones which line its roof and sides are very rough, and it has evidently been left unfinished. After ascending this passage for a distance of 109 feet 7 inches, we reach the Grand Passage, which, from its greater dimensions, presents a comparatively imposing appearance. It ascends at the same angle as the last, while a horizontal passage runs beneath it to a chamber to be subsequently mentioned. Just within the Grand Passage is the mouth of the Well, an irregular pit, partly excavated in the rock, leading to the lower portion of the first passage. Its object was probably to afford an exit to the workmen who had been engaged in closing the ascending passage. The Grand Passage is 6 feet 10 inches in w idth at its base, 28 feet high, and 156 feet long. The blocks which compose its sides gradually approach, every course above the second projecting a little, and on each side is a stone bench. At the end of this passage a horizontal one begins, of much smaller but unequal dimensions, and 22 feet 1 inch in length, leading to the Grand Chamber, commonly called the King’s Chamber, which it enters at the eastern end of its north side. This, which is the principal sepulchral chamber (unless, indeed, there be an undiscovered one of greater importance), is lined with red granite, and measures in length 34 feet 3 inches, in width 17 feet 1 inch, and in height 19 feet 1 inch. It is altogether plain, and contains only a sarcophagus of red granite, which is equally unadorned. Above this chamber are five small ones, which may be called entresols, evidently designed to lighten the pressure of the superincumbent masonry, particularly as the uppermost of them has a pointed roof. Four of these were discovered by the late General Howard Vyse, who found in them quarry-marks, bearing, in two varieties, the name of Khufu, the royal builder of the pyramid. These chambers are reached with difficulty, and chiefly by forced passages. The horizontal passage beneath the Grand Passage must now be described. This is but 3 feet 10 inches high, and [9:7:772] 3 feet 5⅛ inches wide, for the first 92 feet of its length, and then we descend a step and find the passage to be 5 feet 8 inches high for 17 feet 11 inches farther, until it enters the “Queen’s Chamber,” as it is usually called, at the eastern corner of its north side. This chamber is 18 feet 9 inches long, and 17 feet broad, and its extreme height is 20 feet 3 inches. It has a pointed roof, of great blocks of stone, inclined upwards and meeting in the middle. Within it is the entrance of a forced passage. The remainder of the first passage, beyond where the first ascending passage leads to the most interesting parts of the structure, is still to be noticed. It continues below the forced entrance to the ascending passage for a distance of 239 feet 10 inches, being cut through the rock on which the pyramid is built. For this space its inclination and proportions do not change, but it then becomes horizontal for 27 feet, terminating at the entrance of an excavated chamber 46 feet in length, and 27 feet 1 inch in breadth, but of irregular and inconsiderable height. There is no doubt that this chamber was left unfinished at the closing of the pyramid. Beyond it the passage continues, opposite to where it entered the chamber, and extends horizontally 52 feet 9 inches into the rock in the same direction.

The Second Pyramid, which bore the name of “the Great,” and was the tomb of Khafra, or Chephren (Dynasty IV.), stands at a short distance to the south-west of the Great Pyramid, which does not very much exceed it in magnitude, though far superior in its construction. It has a base of 690 feet 9 inches square, and is 447 feet 6 inches in height, being more steep than its larger neighbour. A great part of its casing having been preserved, extending about a fourth of the distance from the summit, the ascent is very difficult, especially as when one has climbed on to the cased portion he can see nothing of the lower part of the building, and thus feels as if upon a pyramid in the air. There are two entrances, both in the north side, from which, and other peculiarities, it is possible that the building was originally much smaller than now, and that, after its first completion, it was enlarged, and a new entrance and sepulchral chamber added.

The Third Pyramid, “the Superior,” the tomb of Menkaura, or Mycerinus, is almost in a line with the other two, and of much smaller dimensions, being only 203 feet in height, and 354 feet 6 inches square at the base. It is constructed beautifully, and in a costly manner, and in these respects is unexcelled, if equalled, by any other pyramid. The exterior was anciently cased altogether, or iu part, with granite, but this has been generally torn off. General Vyse opened it, and found that it had been previously ransacked. In it he discovered a very beautiful sarcophagus (which was unfortunately lost at sea on its way to England), as well as part of a mummy-case, bearing the name of King Menkaura, and a mummy, not certainly the king’s, both of which are now in the British Museum. This confirms the statement of Herodotus that it was the tomb of Mycerinus. Manetho says that it was built by Queen Nitocris (Dynasty VI.). This apparent inconsistency is explained, as Bunsen remarks (Egypt's Place, ii. 165, seq., 210, seq.}, by the construction of the pyramid, which has two principal chambers, and was evidently enlarged after its first completion, so that we may reasonably suppose that it is the sepulchre of both Mencheres and Queen Nitocris.

Near the three large pyramids are six smaller ones; three of these arc near the east side of the Great Pyramid, and three on the south side of the Third Pyramid. They were probably the tombs of near relations of the kings who founded the great pyramids. The space around the pyramids is occupied by very numerous tombs, some built of stone, others excavated in the sides of the rock on which the pyramids stand, while others are simply pits with sepulchral chambers leading from them. The most interesting of these occupy a square bounded on the east by the Great Pyramid and on the south by the Second, and are mostly the sepulchres of the subjects of Khufu and other kings of Dynasties IV. and V. These tombs, which are of inconsiderable dimensions in comparison with many at Thebes and elsewhere, are all built of stone, and have inclined walls, so as to resemble truncated pyramids. They usually contain a chapel, or more rarely chapels, the walls of which are decorated with most remarkable painted sculptures, portraying the everyday life of the Egyptians at that remote age, with short inscriptions of an explanatory character. The absence of representations of the gods and subjects clearly connected with religion is noteworthy. Other similar tombs stand to the east and south of the Great Pyramid; and in the former direction are the principal sepulchral grottoes hewn iu the side of the elevated rocky tract on which the pyramids stand. Some of these excavations bear similar representations to those of the other tombs already mentioned. To the east of the Second Pyramid is the Great Sphinx, called in Egyptian “hu,” emblem of Hor-em-akhu, “Horus in the horizon,” one of the most characteristic monuments of this wonderful necropolis, of an earlier date than the Great Pyramid. It is a recumbent androsphinx, or man-headed lion, 188 feet 9∣ inches in length, hewn out of a natural eminence in the solid rock, some defects of which are supplied by a partial stone-casing, the legs being likewise added. Steps lead down to its front, where are a sanctuary and tablets, but these are covered by the sand, which, after the hollow has been cleared, speedily fills it again. Not far to the westward of the Sphinx is the remarkable excavation known as Campbell’s Tomb, discovered by General Vyse, chiefly consisting of a large pit surrounded by a trench. The causeways leading to the Great Pyramid and to the Third, the former of which greatly excited the admiration of Herodotus, are well worthy of a careful examination. The only pyramid which stands to the north of this group is that of Aboo-Ruweysh, which is in so ruined a condition as scarcely to deserve a visit. It lies about five miles to the north of the Great Pyramid.

Southward of the Pyramids of El-Geezeh, the first objects of interest are those forming the similar group of Aboo-Seer, of much smaller dimensions, the largest being about the size of the Third Pyramid. They are on the elevated edge of the Libyan chain, about seven miles from the Third Pyramid, and are four in number, three being large, and the fourth very small. The Northern Pyramid of Aboo-Seer appears to have been the tomb of Sahura of Dynasty V., and the Middle Pyramid is the tomb of Ra-n-user of the same line.

About two miles farther in the same direction are the Pyramids of Sakkârah, the greatest and most remarkable of which is called the Pyramid of Steps. The tract around them appears from the number of the tombs to have been the principal burial place of Memphis, to which it is near. The Pyramid of Steps has a height of 196 feet 6 inches, and its base formerly measured on the north and south sides 351 feet 2 inches, and on the east and west 393 feet 11 inches. Within it are numerous passages and a gallery, which must, for the most part, have been made subsequently to the completion of the structure. In the centre is a very lofty and narrow chamber, and near it a small one, which was lined with blue tiles. In the latter was an inscription containing the title of the bulls Apis. Under the old monarchy those sacred animals were here entombed. It is thought that this pyramid was constructed by Uenephes of Dynasty I. If Manetho be correct in assigning the introduction of the worship of Apis to a later king, this [9:7:773] pyramid, if of Uenephes,was originally a royal sepulchre. In the tract between the Pyramids of Sakkârah and Aboo-Seer are the remains of the Sarapeum, and the burialplace of the bulls Apis, both discovered by M. Mariette. They are inclosed by a great wall, having been connected, for the Sarapeum was the temple of the defunct Apis. The tombs are in subterranean galleries or in separate excavations which contain many sarcophagi, in which the bulls were entombed. Not the least important result of this discovery is the certainty that Sarapis was a form of Osiris, and that his name was Hesiri-hâpi, or Osiris-Apis (Brugsch, Reiseberichte aιιs Aegypten, 27, seqqf, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson had long previously suggested (Materia Hiero-gtyphica, 21, and Vocab. MS. addition). The other pyramids are of comparatively little interest. There are also some curious private tombs, among which may be particularized a large grotto excavated in the face of the rock overlooking the valley, which is remarkable for being vaulted on the principle of the true arch, but without a key-stone. It is of the time of Psammetichus I. of Dynasty XXVI., being, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks, one of the two earliest known examples of the arch in stone, though, as he adds, there are brick arches at Thebes of the time of Amenophis I. of Dynasty XVIII. (Modem Egypt and Thebes, i. 368-9).

The site of Memphis is marked by mounds in the cultivated tract to the east of the Pyramids of Sakkârah, and near the village of Meet-Rabeeneh. Of the great temple of Ptah, its tutelary divinity, there are no remains above ground, except a few blocks of stone and some broken statues, one of which is a fine colossus of Ramses II., which most probably stood in ancient times before one of the principal entrances of the temple. It is of white chert, and beautifully executed, representing the king in a standing posture. It has fallen to the ground, and has lost part of its legs; nevertheless it has suffered inconsiderable damage elsewhere, so as to be still one of the finest specimens of Egyptian art. The original height was more than 40 feet. This colossus is the property of the British nation, but no steps have been taken to remove it to this country. As Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks, “when the Turks have burnt it for lime, it will be regretted” (Modem Egypt and Thebes, i. 373). The site of Memphis being in the cultivated tract, and near the modern capitals of Egypt, its monuments have alike suffered from the destructive power of nature, and from the barbarism of those who have used them as quarries or defaced them from motives of fanaticism. The Pyramids have not escaped man’s violence, but their vastnes3 has generally defied his attacks.

At a distance of about five miles to the south of the Pyramid of Steps is the northernmost of the Pyramids of Dahshoor, an interesting group, of the history of which nothing certain is known. To their north is a vast truncated pyramid, the sepulchre of Unas, last king of Dynasty V., anciently called “the Most Beautiful Place,” now Mastabat Faraoon, or “Pharaoh’s Seat.” Two of the Pyramids of Dahshoor are of stone, and three of crude brick. The former exceed in size all the other pyramids except the First and Second of El-Geezeh, and have remarkable chambers within them. The Northern Stone Pyramid has a base of 700 feet, and a height of 326 feet 6 inches, and has lost somewhat of its size, having originally measured 719 feet 5 inches, and 342 feet 7 inches. Some of the casing remains. It has an entrance in the northern face, leading to three chambers of similar construction to the Grand Passage in the Great Pyramid. The Southern Stone Pyramid is distinguished by the peculiarity of its form and by having two entrances, one in the eastern face and the other in the northern. The lower portion has an angle of 54* 14' 46'', but the inclination then changes to 42° 59' 26.'' It has been supposed that it was suddenly completed, having been originally planned to be much loftier, but the method in which the pyramids were built renders this unlikely; and it seems rather to have been given this form to gratify a whim of the founder, especially as the entrances in different faces afford another peculiarity. Its base is 615 feet 8 inches, and its height 319 feet 6 inches. At its southern side is a small brick pyramid. The Northern and Southern Brick Pyramids of Dahshoor are to the east of those already described. They are now in a very ruined state, being merely mounds of crude brick; one of them is probably the Pyramid of Asychis mentioned by Herodotus.

Among the earlier explorers of the necropolis of Memphis was Belzoni, by whom the Second Pyramid was opened. General Howard Vyse first undertook a complete examination of the series of pyramids, and having secured the assistance of Mr Perring, carried out this project with well-merited success. Professor Lepsius, the head of the Prussian expedition, opened many tombs in the Memphite necropolis, and has published in his magnificent work (Denkmäler aus Aegypten und Aethiopien) the most interesting sculptures which they contain. M. Mariette, aided by the French Government, discovered the Sarapeum and the tombs of the bulls Apis, and has since continued his researches under the authority of the khedive.

The voyage up the Nile from Cairo may now be described. Not far south of Masr El-’Ateekah, the mountain and desert approach very near the river on that side, and soon after the wide opening of a valley is seen. Beyond it is a bold promontory of the eastern range, which first gradually recedes and then becomes parallel with the river for some distance, leaving but a narrow strip of cultivated land. Behind the village of Turk, the ancient Troja, are the quarries named after it, and a little farther to the south are those of El-Maasarah. These quarries are great excavated chambers and passages, which are entered by large square apertures in the steep face of the mountain. Hence were taken the finer blocks of limestone employed in the construction of the Pyramids of El-Geezeh. Tablets in both quarries record the quarrying executed under different sovereigns. South of the quarries the character of the eastern bank continues unchanged, and presents no remarkable object until we reach the promontory of the Sheykh Aboo-Noor, which will be subsequently mentioned. The western bank, on the contrary, is broad and fertile, abounding in villages, and above its palm-groves rise in the distance the massive forms of the long series of pyramids. Considerably beyond those of Dahshoor, which may be considered as the most southern in the Memphite necropolis, are the two Pyramids of El-Metâneeyeh, which are too small to be seen from the river, and yet farther the solitary Pyramid of Meydoom, commonly called the False Pyramid. Dr Brugsch thinks it very probable that it was the tomb of Senoferu, last king of Dynasty III. It is a structure of great size, having a base of about 400 feet, and a height of about 310 feet. Iu consequence of blocks having been pulled off its sides for building purposes, it has the appearance of being built in two degrees, the lower of which is much greater than the upper, while the fallen stones around its base make it seem as if raised upon an eminence to increase its apparent size, and hence its name. The entrance has not beeu discovered. Its position, rising alone above the rich valley and desert beyond, without any object by which to measure its size, render this pyramid, especially when seen from some distance across a broad part of the river to the north, a very striking object. There is nothing else worthy of a visit on the western bank until [9:7:774] we reach the town of Benee-Suweyf, about seventy miles by the course of the river from Cairo.

Benee-Suweyf is a busy town, being the port of the Feiyoom. A. road leads hence to that province, in a north-westeιly direction. After crossing the great canal called the Bahr-Yoosuf, we pass through the opening in the Libyan range which leads to the Feiyoom, leaving on our right the ruined brick Pyramid of El-Lâhoon, so called from an adjacent village.

The Feiyoom, including its lake, is a pear-shaped tract (its narrowest part being to the west), extending into the desert, and measuring in its greatest length about thirty miles, and in its greatest breadth about twenty. The part now cultivated is more than two-thirds of this extent from the east. At the north-western extremity is the great lake of El-Karn, which is long and narrow, and fills the northern portion of the valley. A branch of the Bahr-Yoosuf flows through the opening leading to the Feiyoom. This canal soon spreads into many streams, two of which, after joining into a single course, carry off the superabundant waters of the inundation into the lake of El-Karn, while they contribute with the others to irrigate the cultivable tracts.

The site of the famous Labyrinth first claims our notice after entering the Feiyoom. Its position may be known by a ruined crude brick pyramid, that of Hawarah, which is spoken of by both Herodotus and Strabo, and may be called the Pyramid of the Labyrinth. The remains of the Labyrinth itself, which had been previously known, were first carefully examined by the Prussian expedition headed by Professor Lepsius, in 1843. The structure was so ruined, however, that the results were not as decisive as might have been hoped. Yet the plan was to some extent made out, and the building shown to have contained a great number of very small chambers, as ancient writers had said; and the discovery of royal names of Dynasty XII., particularly of Amenemhat III, to whom Mauetho ascribes the founding of the Labyrinth, leaves little doubt that this king was the Moeris who built the Labyrinth, according to the classic writers. The use of this building has not been distinctly ascertained. Manetho indeed makes it to have been the founder’s tomb, but it is most probable that he was buried in the pyramid, which, however, the Egyptian historian may have regarded as part of the Labyrinth, as it is evidently connected with that structure.

Not far beyond the site of the Labyrinth is the capital of the province, usually called “El-Medeeneh,” or “the City,” and “Medeeuet-el-Feiyoom,” “the City” or “Capital of the Feiyoom,” close to the mounds of the ancient Arsinoë, or Crocodilopolis. It is a small but flourishing town. The only monuments of antiquity in its neighbourhood are the remains at Beyâhmoo somewhat to the north, and the great broken tablet at Begeeg, at a smaller distance to the south. The former are two structures supposed by some to be pyramids, and the latter, which is a record of the time of Usurtesen I., is usually called an obelisk, but it must rather be regarded as a very tall and narrow stele or tablet, upwards of 40 feet in height.

In this part of the Feiyoom, to the north of El-Medeeneh, may be traced the remains of that remarkable hydraulic work the Lake Moeris. M. Linant, a French engineer, was the first to determine the position and character of this famous work of antiquity; and the results of his investigations are in accordance with the opinions of some who had previously noticed the subject in published works {Mémoire sur le Lac Moerisf Soc. Eg., 1843). The object of the Lake Moeris was to regulate the irrigation of the I eiyoom, anciently the Crocodilopolite Nome, and afterwards the Arsinoïte; and it was valuable on account of its fisheries. It seems rather to have deserved the name of a very large reservoir than that of a lake. Notwithstanding the drying up of the Lake Moeris, the Feiyoom is still an important and fertile province. It produces very large quantities of grapes; and the fields of roses, cultivated for the sake of rose-water, present a remarkable appearance.

The great Lake of El-Karn is perhaps the most interesting object in this part of Egypt. Its name, Birket-el-Karn, signifies “The Lake of the Horn,” or “Projection,” by which an island is intended, and not its general form, as has been supposed, It is, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson about 35 miles long and about 7 broad at its widest part and is not deep, as far as has been ascertained. The watet is brackish and unwholesome, though derived from the Nile, which has at all seasons a much higher level. It is bounded on the south by tracts in a state of cultivation, or deserted for want of labourers, though anciently cultivated, and on the north by the Libyan desert, above which rises a bold range of mountains; and it has a strange and picturesque wildness. Its northern shore was anciently cultivated, at least in part, but is now entirely waste. Near the lake are several sites of ancient towns, and the temple called Kasr-Kâroon distinguishes the most important of these. That temple, however, being devoid of sculpture, and doubtless of the Roman period, could not attract attention except in a region barren of monuments. After this cursory view of the Feiyoom we may return to the Nile and continue our southward course.

Not far south of Benee-Suweyf the eastern chain is washed by the river at the picturesque promontory of the Sheykh Aboo-Noor, whose tomb stands on its summit. From this point as far as the town of Manfaloot the mountains on the east are close to the Nile, leaving a narrow space of cultivable land, or none at all, while the western bank is far broader than before. For forty miles nothing remarkable attracts the eye except the lofty mounds of ancient towns, until one sees the well-proportioned minaret of a mosque in the large village of Semeloot, said to have been erected by the architect of the mosque of Sultan Hasan at Cairo. Not far beyond, the river washes the picturesque cliffs of Gebel-et-Teyr, or the Mountain of Birds, part of the eastern range. Upon its summit stands a Coptic convent, called the Convent of the Virgin, Deyr-el- , Adra. One of the monks of this convent usually climbs down the steep face of the mountain by a dizzy path, and swims to the traveller’s boat to solicit alms as a fellow Christian. In this part of Egypt we first begin to notice the entrances of grottoes in the face of the eastern mountains, but none of these for some distance are known to be of any interest. Not far beyond Gebel-et-Teyr is the town of El-Minyeh, on the western bank, a place wearing a cheerful aspect. Opposite El-Minyeh are quarries and sepulchral grottoes, the most remarkable of the latter being at a site called El-K0m-el-Ahmar, or “the Red Mound.” These are of the age of Dynasties IV. and VI., but they have sustained so much damage in modern times that they do not repay a visit, except from one who is a student of hieroglyphics. A governor of El-Minyeh, an ignorant Turk, used these ancient tombs as quarries; and had it not been for the interference of Mr Harris of Alexandria, the more important grottoes of Benee-Hasan would have shared the same fate at his hands.

The first noteworthy objects above El-Minyeh are the sepulchral grottoes of Benee-Hasan, which are inferior to none in Egypt for beauty and interest. They are excavated in the face of the eastern mountains, which are here very low and sloping, and separated from the river by a small extent of debris and desert, and a very narrow strip of [9:7:775] cultivable land. The grottoes are almost in a line near the summit of the mountain, and at no great height above the river. The two northernmost are remarkable for having porticoes, each supported by two polygonal columns of an order which is believed to be the prototype of the Doric. Most of the grottoes are adorned with sculptures and paintings, which portray with eminent truthfulness and character the manners of the Egyptians of the remote period at which they were executed, for they are tombs of nomarchs and other governors of Dynasty XII. They generally consist of a chapel of large dimensions, having sometimes a portico before it, and a niche with seated figures of the chief persons buried in the tomb at the extremity, and have pits leading to sepulchral chambers. The principal apartment is sometimes supported by pillars cut out of the rock, and vaulted. Its walls bear representations of the diversions of the occupant during his lifetime, and of his varied occupations, in scenes depicting hunting, fishing, games, feasts, the processes of agriculture, and the like. The figures of beasts and birds, more especially the latter, are characterized by a remarkable fidelity and beauty, and there can be no doubt that Egyptian art had attained a greater excellence at this time than it possessed under Dynasty IV. A little to the south of these grottoes, in a ravine, is the Speos Artemidos, a small rock-temple of Sekhet or Pakht, the Egyptian Diana, and some sepulchres of little interest.

A few miles to the south of the Speos Artemidos are two sites, one on either side of the river, which were marked, in the present century, by most important monuments, which have since been destroyed by the Turks. That on the western side, near the large village of El-Ashmooneyn, the ancient Hermopolis Magna, was part of a magnificent portico, bearing the names of Philip Aridaeus, Alexander Aegus, and Ptolemy I., all that stood of the temple of Thoth; and on the opposite side of the river were considerable remains of the edifices of the town of Antinoöpolis founded by Hadrian. While we regret the destruction of such interesting records, we must not charge either the Turks or the native Egyptians with all the mischief of this kind which is perpetrated, and our sorrow is increased by the reflection that to European travellers, principally Englishmen and Americans, must be assigned no small share in the destruction or mutilation of the monuments, which in the case of educated men is nothing less than a crime.

A short distance south of Antinoöpolis is the town of Mel-lawee, on the western bank, and a little farther, on the other side of the river, the promontory called Gebel-esh-Sheykh Sa’eed, which is honeycombed with grottoes, some of which are shown by their sculptures to be very ancient, but are so ill preserved as to require but a short examination. A little beyond, however, in the district of Tell-El-’Amàrineh, or the Mound of El-’Amârineh, a small fertile tract where the eastern mountains recede, noted, like Benee-Hasan, for the turbulent and thievish propensities of its inhabitants, are most curious remains of a very ancient town. It was the capital of Khu-n-aten, the sun-worshipper of Dynasty XVIII,, and was no doubt destroyed by Horus, and not subsequently rebuilt. In the mountain behind it are very interesting sepulchral grottoes, in which were buried the courtiers of this king, and from them we obtain much information respecting his religion, a very pure form of sun-worship. The representations are chiefly of the king, his queen, and their children, distributing presents to the soldiers and others, of acts of worship to the sun, and of the temple of the sun as well as gardens and villas.

On the western bank of the Nile, a little to the south of Tell-el-’Amârineh, is the small town of Deroot-esh-Shereef, supposed to be on the site of the Thebaica Phylace, which guarded the northern boundary of the Thebais. About 20 miles to the south is the town of Manfaloot, on the same side of the river, which has a decayed appearance from the manner in which the stream has encroached upon and washed away part of it. Opposite to Manfaloot in the eastern range are extensive crocodile-mummy catacombs. There is nothing of note during the next 25 miles of the river’s course, which is very winding, until we reach the village of El-Ham rà, the port of Asyoot. This town, the capital of Upper Egypt, or the Sa’eed, that is, of the whole country above Cairo, lies inland, about two miles from El-Hamrà, in a richly cultivated plain. Asyoot, with its beautiful mosques, two of which, one of the Memlook style, and the other of the Turkish, are not unworthy of comparison with those of the metropolis, and its Constantinopolitan palace, surrounded on three sides by verdant fields, and having behind it a fine rounded spur of the western chain, which here, for the first time, is near the river, presents a picturesque aspect as the traveller approaches it. On entering Asyoot he is not disappointed, for the excellence of the goods and provisions sold in the well-built chief market, and the solid look of the houses, indicate activity and prosperity. And it is not a little remarkable that this was an important town some 4000 years ago, and has thus outlived Thebes and Memphis, Tanis and Pelusium. The ancient Egyptian name was Ssut, or probably Ssiut, but the Greeks called it Lycopolis, on account of the worship of the wolf-or jackal-headed divinity of the place, a form of Anubis. In the mountain behind Asyoot are some ancient grottoes, one of which is of great size, but their sculptures have unfortunately suffered much. The view of the valley and the town beneath is an ample reward for the ascent.

Thirty miles farther by the river, on the eastern bank, is the village of Kâw-el-Kebeereh, where was anciently Antaeopolis. The interesting remains of the temple of Antaeus, which stood here early in the present century, have entirely disappeared through the encroachment of the river, and also, it is believed, from having been used as a quarry by the Turks. A few miles beyond, the lofty part of the eastern range called the Gebel-esh-Sheykh-El-Hareedee from a famous Muslim saint, hems in the river on one side for a short distance. It soon, however, retires again, and the valley on that side becomes broader than usual. Here, a short way from the river, stands the small town of Akhmeem, the ancient Chemmis, or Panopolis. No remains of importance mark this site. About 22 miles farther by the course of the river, on the western bank, is the important town of Girgà, which was, until a comparatively recent period, the capital of the Sa’eed. The rise of Asyoot, however, and the agency of the river which is gradually washing it away, have contributed to its decline, and it wears a dilapidated aspect.

The city of Abydos was a few miles from Girgà, in a south-westerly direction on the border of the desert, here separated from the Nile by a broad cultivated tract. Close to it was Thinis or This, the town of Menes. Two interesting edifices render Abydos worthy of a visit. They are both dedicated to Osiris, the chief divinity of the place. The southernmost of these is a temple of Osiris, in which we find the names of Ramses II. and his father Setee I. The other structure is smaller, and in a worse state of preservation than the other temple, and among its sculptures are the same names, those of Setee I. and Ramses II. Hence was taken the famous list of Pharaohs known as the Tablet of Abydos, which is now one of the most valuable objects in the British Museum, and M. Mariette has since discovered a corresponding tablet in the other temple, happily complete. In the desert near by are many sepulchres, remarkable on account of the interesting antiquities which have been discovered by clearing them out. The sanctity [9:7:776] of Abydos as a reputed burial-place of Osiris rendered this a favourite necropolis of the ancient Egyptians from very early times, particularly under Dynasty XII.

At a distance of more than 40 miles from Abydos, but in nearly the same latitude, is the village of Dendarah, on the left, here the southern, bank of the Nile. Before reaching it we pass the small town of Farshoot at the mouth of the great canal called the Bahr-Yoosuf, and the large village of Hoo, marking the site of Diospolis Parva. Opposite the latter place are some sepulchral grottoes in the eastern chain, called those of Kasr-es-Seiyâd, which is believed to occupy the position of Chenoboscion. They contain names of kings of Dynasty VI., but the representations which occupy their walls are not of unusual interest. At Dendarah is the first well-preserved and unencumbered temple that is seen in a voyage up the Nile, that of Athor, the Egyptian Venus, who presided over the town of Tentyra, or Tentyris, the capital of the Tentyrite nome. It stands on the mounds of the town about a mile and a half from the Nile. From it we gain a good idea of Egyptian religious architecture under the Greek and Roman dominions.

The temple is surrounded by a great wall of crude brick, entered by a stone portal adorned with sculptures representing the emperors Domitian and Trajan, engaged in acts of worship before several divinities. The portico to which it leads is about 135 feet in width, and is one of the richest and most beautiful structures of the kind. It is supported by twenty-four columns, four deep, nearly 50 feet in height, and having a diameter of somewhat more than 7 feet at the thickest part. The capitals have a full face of Athor sculptured on each of their four sides, and above these a kind of shrine. The three columns on each side of the entrance are connected by an intercolumniation. The portico, like the rest of the temple, is of higher merit as regards its architecture than its sculpture, for the latter art had declined under the Greek and Roman rule to a much greater degree than the former. The sculptures are of the same kind as on the portal, representing offerings made by some of the earlier Caesars; and on the ceiling are various mystical subjects, probably of an astronomical import, and the famous Zodiac from which an extravagant idea of the antiquity of the temple was deduced before hieroglyphics were interpreted. The greater part of the back wall of the portico was the front of the temple before this portion was added. This inner part consists of three considerable chambers, an isolated sanctuary, and numerous small apartments. The first of these is a hall, supported by a double row of columns, three on each side, of a rather heavy form, for they have, beneath the capital formed of the block with the faces of Athor and the shrine, another capital of a cup shape. This hall is entered by a doorway in the middle of the back wall of the portico, and passing through it we reach a second and third chamber of tbe same breadth but shorter, and then the sanctuary. This chamber is much narrower, and is isolated by a passage running round it. On each side of the chambers and passage are many small apartments, two passages to the exterior, and two staircases; and there are singular inclined passages in the walls, two of which are entered from the sides of the portico. The whole interior is covered with sculptures and inscriptions of a religious character, stating in a systematic manueτ the use of each chamber in the temple-worship. The royal names have not always been filled in, the rings remaining vacant; but when they have been sculptured, they are generally those of the last Cleopatra, and Ptolemy Caesar, her son by Julius Caesar. On the roof of the temple to which the staircases lead, there are a sort of chapel and some small chambers, one of which 13 very interesting, because its sculptures relate to the myth of Osiris. The exterior of the temple is as completely covered with sculptures as the interior. Among the figures represented here are those of Cleopatra and Ptolemy Caesar; but they cannot be supposed to convey any resemblance, since they belong not alone to a conventional art, but almost to its lowest period. There are two smaller temples near the great temple of Athor, one of Isis, and the other of the kind called a Typhonium. Both are of the Roman time. See admirable account of the temple in Mariette’s Monuments of Upper Egypt, 125 seqq.

On the opposite side of the Nile, a little above Dendarah, is the town of Kiuè, between which and Arabia some traffic is carried on by the route through the desert to El-Kuseyr on the Red Sea. The best of the porous water bottles which are used throughout Egypt are manufactured here; and the great water-jars, called “bellâsee,” which the women carry, are made at the large village of Bellas, a few miles higher on the western bank. Opposite to Bellâs is the village called Kuft or Kift, marking the site of the important town of Coptos, which was the emporium on the Nile of the Arabian and Indian trade under the Ptolemies; and, somewhat to the south, is the inconsiderable town of Koos, the ancient Apollinopolis Parva, which succeeded to the trade of Coptos, under the Muslims, until Kinè supplanted it. On the western bank, a little higher, is the small town of Nakâdeh, which the people call Nagâdeh, where are Roman Catholic and Coptic convents. A short distance beyond Nakâdeh are the northernmost of the remains of Thebes.

The monuments of Thebes do not present from afar the imposing appearance of the Pyramids of Memphis. Placed for the most part at a distance from the Nile, as well as from one another, and having on the western side the picturesque form of a much higher mountain than any near Memphis rising behind them, they do not strike those who see them from the river. Most of them are not indeed visible from the Nile except when it is at its height. The stately colonnade of the temple of El-Uksur, incorrectly called Luxor, on the very bank, is, however, not unworthy the magnificence of Thebes, and when one approaches the other monuments his utmost expectations are exceeded by the grandeur of El-Karnak, the beauty of the temple of Ramses IL, and the mystery of the Tombs of the Kings. Nowhere else are the mythology, the history, the very life and manners of the Egyptians of old times so vividly brought before the eye as in the sculptured and inscribed monuments of the capital of the Empire.

Thebes, or Diospolis Magna, is called in the hieroglyphic inscriptions Ap-t, or, with the article prefixed, T-ap, whence Thebes, and Nu-Amen, the city of Amen, the No-Amon or No of the Bible. The date of its foundation is unknown, but there are remains of the time of Dynasty XL, the first of Diospolite kings. Under the sovereigns of Dynasty XII. it must have become a place of importance, but it probably declined during the troubles of the Shepherd period. With Dynasty XVIII. it attained its highest prosperity, and maintained it during Dynasties XIX. and XX. To this period its greatest monuments belong. Then its decline evidently commenced; but from the manner in which Homer mentions it (II. ix. 381-4), Thebes must have been still a great city in his days. After this it suffered severely from the violence of the Assyrians and Persians, and lastly of Ptolemy Lathyrus; so that in Strabo’s time the Thebans inhabited villages as now, and there was no longer a city (Geogr., xvii. 1).

The monuments of Thebes, exclusive of its sepulchral grottoes, occupy a space on both sides of the river, of which the extreme length from north to south is about two miles, and the extreme breadth from east to west about four. The [9:7:777] city was on the eastern bank, where is the great temple, or rather collection of temples, called after El-Karnak, a modern village near by. The temple of El-Karnak is about half a mile from the river, in the cultivable land. More than a mile to the south-west is the temple of El-Uksur, on the bank of the Nile. On the western bank was the suburb bearing the name Memnonia. The desert near the northernmost of the temples on this side, the Setheum, almost reaches the river, but soon recedes, leaving a fertile plain generally more than a mile in breadth. Along the edge of the desert, besides the Setheum, are the Rameseum of El-Kurneh, and, less than a mile farther to the southwest, that of Medeenet-Haboo, and between them, but within the cultivated land, the remains of the Amenophium with its two gigantic seated colossi. Behind these edifices rises the mountain, which here attains a height of about 1200 feet. It gradually recedes in a south-westerly direction, and is separated from the cultivated tract by a strip of desert in which are numerous tombs, partly excavated in two isolated hills, and two small temples. A tortuous valley, which begins not far from the Setheum, leads to those valleys in which are excavated the Tombs of the Kings beneath the highest part of the mountain which towers above them in bold and picturesque forms.

The temple of El-Uksur is nearest of the edifices to the river, and but an appendage to the great group of El-Karnak. It takes its name from the small town of El-Uksur, or Abu-1-Haggâg, which is built in and around part of it, thus injuring its effect, and rendering examination difficult. It differs from most Egyptian temples in not facing the river, but this is accounted for by its connection with the temple of El-Karnak, from the southern approaches to which a long avenue of sphinxes (now wholly ruined) leads to it, ending at its entrance. This is a massive propylon, or portal with wings, 200 feet in width, before which is a very fine obelisk of red granite. Its fellow, which stood on the western side, was removed by the French to Paris in 1831, and now adorns the Place de la Concorde. Both have beautifully cut hieroglyphic inscriptions. The height of that which remains is about 80 feet. It is adorned with three vertical lines of hieroglyphics on each side, bearing the titles of Ramses II. The other obelisk differs from this only in being slightly shorter. Close to the winged portal are three seated statues of red granite representing Ramses II. · a fourth has been destroyed. The wings of the portal are covered with sculptures of remarkable interest, representing occurrences in the war of Ramses II. with the Klιeta or Hittites, in his fifth year. On the left wing is depicted the defeat by the Egyptians, led by their king, of the confederate peoples under the walls of the Hittite stronghold called Ketesh, or Kadesh, on the Orontes. The king is represented, according to the Egyptian custom, of a gigantic size, standing in his chariot, which he has urged into the midst of the hostile force, whose warriors fall by his well-directed arrows. The Egyptians, on the other hand, sustain no loss. On the right wing is represented the Egyptian camp. This has been sculptured over another subject, of which part may be now seen, owing to the falling out of the plaster with which it had been filled. All these representations are in sunk relief, and beautifully executed.

The entrance to the temple is contracted by a modern wall, through the small door of which we pass into a great court choked by the huts of the town, among which stands a mosque. The court is surrounded by a double row of columns, the capitals of which have the form of the bud of the papyrus. À ruined portal with wings forms the end cf this court, and with it begins the older part of the edifice, which has a more southerly direction; and its southernmost part in like manner turns a little more in that direction, that is, from the river, though not so remarkably. Some deviation was probably rendered necessary by the course of the Nile. The second court is much obstructed by rubbish; nothing is seen of it but a magnificent central avenue of fourteen columns, having capitals of the bell-shaped flower of the papyrus. The columns are about 60 feet in height, of fine form, and elegantly sculptured. They were raised by Amenophis III., whose name is the oldest which occurs on them and in the rest of the temple. Behind this is another court, which has a double row of columns on each side, and at its end a portico supported by columns four deep. This court is much ruined. Beyond it are several chambers of the time of Amenophis III., and in the midst of them an isolated sanctuary, the sculptures of which bear the name of Alexander Aegus, in whose reign it was built, in the place, no doubt, of one destroyed by the Persians under Cambyses or Ochus, as Sir Gardner Wilkinson remarks (Modern Egypt and Thebes, ii. 245). Most of these apartments are in a dilapidated state.

Although there is an approach to the temple of El-Karnak from that of El-Uksur, the grand entrance was towards the river, and from that direction it should be entered. This extraordinary assemblage of buildings consists of a great temple and several smaller structures, surrounded by a massive crude brick wall. There are other remains similarly inclosed, which were connected with the great temple.

The grand entrance is through a propylon more than 360 feet wide, for this is its measure above the rubbish which is piled up around it. It was never sculptured, nor was its surface smoothed. It presents, therefore, a rude appearance, and is much ruined, a great part of the left or northern wing having been demolished. The court of which the propylon forms the front measures 329 feet in width and 275 in length, having on each side a gallery with a single row of columns; and a double colonnade, of which one column alone stands, formed an avenue from its entrance to that of the hypostyle hall beyond. On the right side a temple of older date interrupts the side gallery, extending 50 feet into the court. Its front is formed by a propylon, about 90 feet wide, on each wing of which Ramses III. is portrayed in the act of slaying prisoners before Amen-ra. The interior of this temple consists of a court, which has on each side a row of Osiridean pillars, and at the end another row of such pillars with columns behind them, a hall or portico supported by eight columns, next to the court, and, beyond, other apartments. Nearly all the sculptures are of the reign of Ramses III., but the names of later sovereigns occur. On the other side of the great court is a small structure which may be called a chapel, or three chapels. The most interesting sculptures in this part of the group of temples are outside the eastern portion of the south wall of the great court, for here is the famous list of countries and towns subdued by Sheshonk I., or Shishak, the head of Dynasty XXII. Among the names is that thought to be the kingdom of Judah, and those of several places in the dominions of Rehoboam and Jeroboam I. At the end of the court is a fine portal, the wings of which are much ruined. This is the entrance to the great hypostyle hall, the most magnificent work of its class in Egypt. Its length is 170 feet, and its width 329; it is supported by 134 columns, the loftiest of which are nearly 70 feet in height, and about 12 in diameter, and the rest more than 40 feet in height, and about 9 in diameter. The great columns, 12 in number, form an avenue through the midst of the court from the entrance, and the others are arranged in rows very near together on each side. There is a transverse avenue made by two rows of the smaller columns being placed farther apart than the [9:7:778] rest. This great hall is therefore crowded with columns, and the effect is surprisingly grand. The spectator, being generally unable to see beyond the columns which are immediately around him, perceives the vast dimensions which, if viewed from a distance, might lose their effect. The forest of columns seems interminable in whatever direction he looks, producing a result unsurpassed in any other Egyptian temple. The partial ruin of its stone roof, and of some of the columns, renders the hall the more picturesque, and makes us wonder at the force which must have been expended in attempting to demolish it. This grand hall was built by Setee I., Dynasty XIX., and sculptured partly in his reign and partly in that of his son and successor Ramses II., who has sometimes effaced his father’s name to substitute his own. It commemorates, not in its grandeur alone, but also by its sculptures, the magnificence and power of these two great Pharaohs. The sculptures of the interior of the walls represent these kings making offerings to the gods, and the like subjects occupy the columns. Far more interesting are those which adorn the exterior of the walls, and record the achievements of the same kings, those of Setee I. being on the north wall, and those of Ramses II. on the south. The former are of much greater interest than the latter, as far as we can judge, and in this respect inferior to none in Egypt. The scenes on the north wall are arranged in three compartments, of which the upper one has been nearly destroyed. In these scenes the king is represented of a gigantic size, charging in his chariot, and putting to the rout his enemies, capturing their strongholds, and returning home in triumph. The chief nations are the Kheta or Hittites; the Paten (Leuten), at this time a great nation of Syria; the Shasu, or Arabs; the IChalu, Syria, or Syrians; and Pemenen, Armenia. Among the captured places is Ketesh, in those days the most important stronghold between Egypt and Mesopotamia. There is also a long list of countries, cities, and tribes, conquered or ruled by the king, among which we find Naharina, that is Aram-naharaim, or Mesopotamia, Kesh, Kush, or Ethiopia, &c. The battle-scenes of Ramses II. on the south wall do not, as far as they are seen, equal these in interest. Here also is a list of the king’s conquests and possessions, and on the west side of a wall which joins this one at right angles, forming the side of a court of the southern approach to the temple, is a representation of the capture of Askelena or Ascalon, and an inscription recording the treaty between Ramses II. and the Kheta, concluded in the twenty-first year of his reign. The back of the hypostyle hall is formed by a ruined propylon bearing the name of Amenophis III., and then at a distance of about 50 feet is another propylon, entirely ruined. In the space between these propyla, which was a court, stands a beautiful obelisk of red granite, upwards of 70 feet high, raised by Thothmes I. The fragments of its fellow, which was more to the north, strew the ground. Behind the second of these propyla is another granite obelisk, 108 feet high, and according to M. Mariette the loftiest known (Monuments of Upper Egypt, 170). This great obelisk of El-Karnak is a monument of Queen Hatshepu of Dynasty XVIII., and an inscription on its pedestal records the period which elapsed (nineteen months) from the time that it was begun to be cut in the quarry until its completion in the queen’s sixteenth year. The fellow of the great obelisk, which stood to the south of it, has been broken, and its fragments occupy its place. Beyond the great obelisk is the chief sanctuary, a structure almost entirely of granite, divided into two apartments, which was built under Philip Aridaeus, in the place, no doubt, of one destroyed by Cambyses or Ochus. The space between the hypostyle hall and this sanctuary is extremely ruined, the huge stones being piled up in heaps as though au earthquake had overthrown the temple. But this destruction was probably due to human violence. Behind the sanctuary are fragments of a very ancient part of the temple, bearing the name of Usurtesen I., Dynasty XII. Considerably farther is a large oblate building of the time of Thothmes III., which affords a remarkable example of architectural caprice, its columns having inverted shafts and capitals, and its cornices being likewise inverted. Behind this and a stone wall of inclosure are ruined chambers, and far beyond, directly behind the centre of the great temple, in the crude brick wall of inclosure, is a handsome portal, never finished, bearing the name of Nectanebes II.

The southern approach to the temple of El-Karnak from that of El-Uksur is, as before mentioned, by a ruined avenue of sphinxes, which ends near the great structure, and two other avenues begin. The westernmost of these, which is of colossal rams, conducts to a temple situate not far to the south-west of the first court of the great temple: we approach it through a stately portal bearing in its inscriptions the name of Ptolemy Euergetes I. The front of the temple, before which was another avenue of rams, is a propylon, which is almost uninjured. Behind it is a court having a double row of columns on each side and at the end, and again behind this is a hall supported by eight columns, and many small chambers. This temple was dedicated to Khuns, the third member of the Theban triad. It was begun under Dynasty XX., and continued by the high-priest kings. A small edifice having sculptures of the time of the Greek and Roman rule stands on the west of the court of this temple.

The avenue of sphinxes which branches off at the same place as the avenue of rams leading to the temple of Khuns takes an easterly direction and ends where another begins at right angles to it, which connects the southern courts leading to the great temple with a separate inclosure. The latter contains a lake which has the shape of a horseshoe, and the remains of the temple of Mut. At the northern extremity of the avenue, which is of criosphinxes, is a propylon forming the front of a large court ending in a second propylon, which, like the other, is much ruiued. Beyond this, but not in exactly the same direction, after a vacant space, the approach continues through two smaller propyla, the second of which is nearly destroyed. Each fronts a court, and at the end of the secondof these courts was the great side entrance to the temple. The first and second propyla were, like the criosphinxes, monuments of King Har-em-heb, or Horus, of Dynasty XVIIL,and were partly built of materials of a temple or palace of the sun-worshipping kings whom he overthreλv. The third propylon is more ancient, for it bears the name of Thothmes III. and Amenophis IL, as well as of subsequent kings; the age of the fourth is not certain; the name of Ramses II. occurs here, but it may have been founded before his time. There is an inclosure in the angle formed eastward by the third and fourth propyla with the great temple, which contains a sacred lake.

Adjoining the great crude-brick wall of inclosure at its north-eastern portion is another containing the ruins of an important temple. The chief approach is through a stately portal of the Ptolemaic period, in the crude-brick wall. The temple to which it conducted was very beautifιd and costly, as we can judge from its remains, which show with how much violence it was destroyed. It seems to have been founded under Dynasty XVIII. There are two small temples or chapels, one of the time of Achoris and the other of that of Nectanebes I. and IL, in the same inclosure. Another crude-brick inclosure of small dimensions, near the south-east corner of that of the great temple, contains some unimportant remains of a small edifice.

This brief description will convey some idea of the magnitude of the temple of Amen-ra at Thebes, with its [9:7:779] appendages; but no one who has not seen that wonder- ∣ ful assemblage of ruins can picture to himself the massiveness of its castle-like propyla, the grandeur of its hall of columns, the beauty of its great obelisk, and the sublimity of its heaped-up ruins. Of the city of Thebes there are scarcely any remains. Doubtless its edifices were of perishable materials.

Beginning our examination of the monuments of the western bank, where was the great suburb of the Memnonia, from the northward, the first object of interest is the Setheum, a small temple of Setee I., which the natives call Kasr-Er-Rubeyk, at the ruined village of El-Kurneh. A portico, originally supported by ten columns, of which two have fallen, extends along the whole front of the building. Three entrances lead to the interior of the temple: the middle one of these is the door of a hall having twelve columns. From this apartment we pass into several small chambers, which are of little interest, like the ruined chambers which we enter from the northern door. The southern door is the entrance of a separate part of the edifice, which contains a small hall supported by two columns, and three chambers behind it, the middle one of which was a sanctuary or chapel, devoted, as its sculptures show, to the worship of Ramses I., the father of Setee I. The inscriptions of the temple tell us that it was dedicated to Amen-ra by its founder Setee I., and continued by his son Ramses IL, and his grandson Menptah. It was the funereal chapel of the tombs of Ramses I. and Setee I.

The great temple of Ramses II, which may be called the Rameseum of El-Kurneh, but is commonly though incorrectly known as the Memnonium, is situate at a distance of about a mile to the westward of the Setheum, and is like it on the edge of the desert, which here is much farther from the Nile. Notwithstanding that its condition is much more ruined than that of other edifices of Thebes, the beautiful architecture of what remains, and the historical interest of its spirited sculptures, render it altogether second alone in its attractions to the great pile of El-Karnak. A propylon, 225 feet in width, of which a great part has been thrown down, forms the front of the edifice. Through its portal we enter a spacious court 180 feet wide and 142 long. It had originally a double colonnade on either side, every column of which has been destroyed, while the side walls have been entirely demolished and the end wall partially. On the back of the propylon are sculptured a battle and other scenes of a campaign in the king’s eighth year. In this court is one of the most wonderful objects at Thebes, a colossal statue of Ramses II., broken in pieces, exceeding in its weight and equalling in its dimensions any other known Egyptian statue. It was of a single block of red granite, and must have been transported hither from the quarries of Syene, notwithstanding that its weight was, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s computation, about 887 tons, 5∣ cwt. (Modern Egypt and Thebes, ii. 144, 145). It was 60 feet in height, representing the king seated on his throne, and was placed on the left side of the entrance to the second court. Of that court, happily, there are more remains than of the first. Its width was about 170 feet and its length about 140, so that it was not much smaller than the other court. It had a double colonnade m each side and at the end, and but a single colonnade at the front. These were of columns having capitals of the form of the papyrus bud, except eight of the ten forming the front row, that is, all of that colonnade but the two extreme columns, and, in like manner, the corresponding ones of the opposite row, which were Osiridean pillars, formed of a square block, having in front a figure of Ramses as Osiris. Many of the columns and pillars have been demolished; but those which yet stand enable us to judge how magnificent this part of the temple must have been. On what remains of the front wall of the couft, that is, on its northern half, are very remarkable sculptures. Here is a great scene representing a battle between the Egyptians, led by Ramses IL, and the Kheta or Hittites, near the strong city of Ketesh. The king of Egypt is portrayed routing the chariots of the enemy, who flee in disorder towards Ketesh l across a double moat, beyond which and beneath the city a strong force of regular infantry endeavours to protect their retreat. This was doubtless the decisive action of the campaign against the confederates, which must be regarded as the most important of the wars which distinguished the reign of Ramses IL Higher up on the same wall is a procession of priests bearing small statues of kings, the first of which is that of Menes, the earliest sovereign of Egypt, the second of a Munt-hotp, of Dynasty XT., and the subsequent ones of the kings of Dynasties XVIII. and XIX., as far as Ramses IL, with whom the series ends.

Next to the second court is a hypostyle hall, which is the most admirable part of the temple. It measures 100 feet in length and 133 in breadth, and originally contained forty-eight columns in eight longitudinal rows, each consisting of six columns. A central avenue is formed by twelve lofty columns, about 36 feet high, which have capitals of the shape of the papyrus flower; while the columns on each side, about 24 feet high, have capitals of the shape of the bud of the same flower. The elegance of the form and the justness of the proportions of all these columns is not equalled in any other Egyptian temple, and render this hall one of the most beautiful structures of its kind.· Happily, although much injured, it has suffered less from violence than the first and second courts. On its front wall, to the left as one enters, are curious sculptures, representing the rout of a hostile force, and the capture of a town, the walls of which the Egyptians ascend by means of scaling ladders: Ramses II. and six of his sons lead the army. On the end wall are religious subjects, and a series of the sons and daughters of Ramses IL, whose legitimate offspring they seem to have been, twenty-six in number, twenty-three sons and three daughters. At the temple of Wadee-es-Suboo’a, in Nubia, a much larger number of children of this king were represented.

Beyond the hypostyle hall are two smaller chambers, the first of which is entered by a doorway in the middle of the end wall of the hall. It is supported by eight columns, and has on its walls representations of mythological subjects. It is chiefly remarkable, however, for its astronomical ceiling, one of the most precious records of ancient Egyptian science. Behind this is a ruined chamber, which seems to have been of the same dimensions. The other apartments which must have adjoined these are entirely demolished. This temple was the chapel of the king’s tomb. The description which Diodorus Siculus gives from Hecataeus of Abdera of the Tomb of Osymandyas agrees best with the Rameseum of El-Kurneh; and the mention of the sacred library is in accordance with the character of the sculptures of the first chamber beyond the hypostyle hall, as well a3 with the statement in several papyri that they were written by the scribes in this temple, in which, or attached to which, was a kind of college (Lepsius, Chronologie der Aeggpter, i. 39, 53).

To the south-west of the Rameseum of El-Kurneh, at a distance of less than half a mile, a mound just within tho cultivable plain marks the site of a magnificent temple of Amenophis III., which may be called the Amenophium, and which, there is reason to believe, was destroyed by Cambyses. Of the obelisks and colossi which stood on either side of the approach of the Amenophium, all are thrown down except the two gigantic statues, one of which is known as the Vocal Memnon. The latter indeed, was [9:7:780] broken, but afterwards restored. These colossi stand about a quarter of a mile to the south-east of the mound where are the scanty remains of the temple. They are of hard gritstone, monolithic, and about 47 feet in height, with pedestals about 12 feet high. They represent Amenophis III. seated on his throne. Smaller tlιough colossal standing statues of the king’s mother, Queen Mut-em-wa, and of his wife, Queen Tai, rest against the space between the sides of the throne and the legs of the great statues, one at either extremity; while there are remains of two other statues of Queen Tai, of smaller size, standing between the feet of each colossus. The colossi are a little less than GO feet apart, a distance judiciously chosen, so that they should neither seem smaller than they actually are, by being placed too far from each other, nor should be so near as to appear but a double statue.

The Vocal Memnon is the more northern of the two statues. It was broken in the midst either by the barbarism of Cambyses, or by an earthquake, more probably the former (comp. Paus. A⅛te. i. 42), but long afterwards repaired. It presents in consequence a very shattered appearance, and the other colossus gives us a better idea of what the pair must anciently have been. Many Greek and Latin inscriptions on the Vocal Statue record the visits of those who were with Hadrian, and of others, and relate that they heard the voice of Memnon. There is thus satisfactory evidence to show that some sound was frequently heard here at sunrise; and the only dispute is whether it was produced by a physical cause, or was an imposture of the priests. That it was a natural occurrence does not seem impossible from the examples we have of sounds resembling that which is described as having been heard here by the ancients.

Less than half a mile from the mound of the Amenophium, in a south-westerly direction, within the desert, is the group of temples known as those of Medeenet-Haboo. This name is that applied by the Arabs to a town, which appears to be that called Papa in the Roman times. The ruins of its houses obstruct the temples, more especially the larger of the two. The smaller temple is nearer to the river, to the eastward of the other. We first enter a ruined court, which was never completed, and which had a colonnade of which two columns alone yet stand, at its end, a little before the first propylon of the temple, which bears the names of Ptolemy Lathyrus and Auletes among the sculptures of its gateway. Beyond this is a court which had a colonnade on each side, and a propylon, much smaller than the other at the end. Most of its columns have fallen, and the propylon has also suffered much. On the latter we see the names of Tahraka, or Tirhakah the Ethiopian, and later sovereigns. Beyond this is another court, and then the chambers of the temple. The chief of these is an isolated sanctuary, with a gallery around it having square pillars and fluted columns like those of certain of the tombs at Benee-Hasan. The sanctuary is ornamented with sculptures of sovereigns of Dynasty XVIII., including Queen Hatshepu.

To the south of this temple is a very remarkable structure, which differs from any other ancient monument in Egypt. It is supposed to have been a palace.^[63. The size and character of the only chambers in the temples which could have been used for habitation render it most improbable that any but priests and scribes resided in them; and it is most likely that the royal abodes were usually extensive pavilions constructed of no stronger materials than the houses of the people, and this view the representations of the tombs seem to support. The temples, however, were called palaces] After passing between what seem to have been lodges, we arrive at the main part of the edifice. This consists of two towers on each side of a court, ending in another tower, beneath which is a gateway conducting to the great temple. On the front of each of the two towers first mentioned Ramses III. is represented slaying his enemies before Amen-ra, and below is a series of captured chiefs. The inscriptions that remain tell us that these are the chiefs of the Kheta, or Hittites, the Amari, or Amorites, the Takkaru, or Teucrians, the Shardana of the sea, or Sardones, the Tuirsha of the sea, or Etruscans, and of other peoples. On the walls of the chambers are curious sculptures usually supposed to represent the private life of Ramses III., but probably of a mythological import. Among these the king is portrayed playing at a game like that of draughts with a goddess, while another stands by him.

The great temple of Medeenet-Haboo is directly behind the palace through which was, as already mentioned, the approach to it, and is a monument of the same king, Ramses IΓT., a sovereign inferior alone as a conqueror to Ramses IL, the greatest ruler of Egypt. Both the magnificence of its architecture, and the high interest of its sculptures, render it one of the most interesting edifices at Thebes.

The first propylon cannot be less than 200 feet wide. It is partly destroyed, and much of it is hidden by the remains of the town. Ou its wings the king is represented slaying prisoners before the gods, and acts of worship are also depicted. The court, of which this propylon is the front, is about 110 feet in length and 135 in breadth, and has a colonnade on either side, forming a gallery. The gallery on the right side consists of seven Osiridean pillars, that on the left of eight columns having capitals of the form of the papyrus-flower, affording a remarkable example of the irregularity of Egyptian architecture. At its end is a second propylon, on the left wing of which Ramses III. is represented bringing captives of the Takkaru, or Teucrians, before Amen-ra. Passing through the granite portal of this propylon we enter the second or peristyle court, the finest part of the temple. This court measures about 123 feet in length, and about 133 or somewhat more in w idth, thus exceeding in size the first court, contrary to the usual practice of ancient Egyptian architects. It has a single colonnade at the front and on either side, and a double one at the end. The colonnade at the front and that facing it are each of eight Osiridean pillars, while that behind the latter is of columns with capitals of the papyrus-bud, and the side colonnades consist each of five similar columns, one of which, on the left side, has fallen. The Christian inhabitants of the town, the ruins of whose church are seen in the court, defaced many of the sculptures, and particularly the Osiridean pillars; nevertheless the general effect is not lost, and one is struck by a simple grandeur, which is unsurpassed in any similar Egyptian structure. The sculptures of the walls are of especial interest. On the back of the left wing of the propylon a series of sculptures relating to the wars of Ramses III. begins and extends along the wall on the left side of the court. The rout of the Rebu or Lebu, the Libyans, is depicted, the triumphal return of the king, the bringing of prisoners before him on the field of battle, and the like; and besides these are subjects portraying ceremonies. On the right side-wall is a curious representation of the celebration of the Panegyry of Amen-ra Ka-mut-f, which, from the detail in which it is given, affords us considerable insight into the manner in which such solemnities were kept (Λnc. Ey., iv. pl. 76). On the end wall, and on part of each side wall, are depicted the many children of Ramses III. A door in the end wall conducts to the inner part of the temple, which occupies but little less space than the two courts just described. It is in a very ruined condition.
[9:7:781]

The sculptures of the exterior of this edιfi e next claim our attention, none of which have been mentioned except those which occupy the face of the first propylon. On the north-eastern wall is a remarkably interesting series of scenes in the wars of Ramses III., equalling in the importance of their subjects and the boldness with which they are executed any other records of the kind in Egypt. In the first representation, which is to the extreme right, we sec Ramses III. going to war; in the second is depicted the rout of the Tamhu, a Libyan people; and in the third, prisoners of the Tamhu and Mashuasha, also Libyans, are brought before the king, while scribes count the hands, &c., which have been cut from the slain, showing their number to have been 12,535. Then weapons are counted for distribution to the troops. Then we see troops setting forth. The next scene is a great battle with the Takkaru or Teucrians, whose army is defeated by the Egyptians. The Takkaru fight in chariots of two horses and in waggons drawn by four oxen. Mercenaries or allies of the Shardana, Sardoues, fight in the army of Egypt. The scene which follows this is one of the most spirited of Egyptian sculptures, and if compared with similar Assyrian reliefs, shows the great superiority of the best Egyptian art over that of Assyria. The king, who is passing through a marshy country in his chariot, encounters three lions, and having smitten two of them with his javelins, turns round to meet the third which is about to spring. The next subject, the most remarkable of the series, represents the sea-fight, in which the Egyptian fleet defeated that of the Shardana and the Takkaru, while Ramses and his army fought them from the shore. Ramses then receives the praises of his warriors, and the hands of the slain are brought before him and numbered. Next he leads prisoners, who are of the Takkaru and Rebu, before the gods of Thebes. The other battle-scenes of the series represent the capture of strong places, the carrying away of captives, &c. On the end wall the king is portrayed setting forth on an expedition, and on the other side w all, the south-west, is a long calendar, which appears to occupy the whole wall. This temple was no doubt connected in purpose with the royal tomb. Not far from the Rameseum, to the southward, is a small Ptolemaic temple containing three chambers. Farther in the same direction is a great lake. More than half a mile in a south-westerly direction from the lake is another small temple of Roman times, having an isolated sanctuary and other chambers.

The private and royal tombs must now be briefly noticed, but from their great number, and the variety of the paintings which occupy their walls, it will not be possible to give as detailed an account of them as has been given of the other monuments. Two temples which are situate in the necropolis likewise require a notice. The tombs, as before mentioned, occupy some of the space at the foot of the mountains, or are excavated in their sides towards the valley, and in two isolated hills, except the Tombs of the Kings, which are cut in the sides of two ser* 1 ιded valleys to the westward.

Beginning from the north, we first see the entrances of grottoes in the low spur of the Libyan chain behind the Setheum. Several of these have a series of square apertures, leaving pillars to support the roof, so as to form a kind of portico, behind which is a chamber or chambers, having pits, from which open other chambers for sepulture. Some grottoes here, and others extending towards the Rameseum, are inhabited by the people of El-Kurneh, whose village is ruined. At the foot of the mountains, as well as on their least steep sides, here and throughout the necropolis, are the entrances of many mummy-pits. On the spur above mentioned are brick pyramids, for the most part nearly destroyed; and in the wide tract beyond, the Asaseef, where tne mountains recede, are very remarkable sepulchres of die time of Dynasty XXVI. These are extensive excavations, profusely sculptured almost entirely with hieroglyphics, having before their entrances open courts hewn in the rock, and entered through crude-brick propyla, from which walls of inclosure of the same material extend around the courts. The largest of these, and indeed of all those known at Thebes, is the tomb of Pet-amen-apt, a priest whose date is not fixed, but who probably lived after the fall of the Ramessides. Sir Gardner Wilkinson says that “the area of the actual excavation is 22,217 square feet, and with the chambers of the pits 23,809, though, from the nature of its plan, the ground it occupies is nearly one acre and a quarter” {Modern Egypt and Thebes, ii. 222). Almost all the passages and chambers are covered with hieroglyphic inscriptions on a small scale, aud the few sculptures are of a religious character. At the end of the Asaseef is a temple which was approached by a very long avenue of sphinxes now entirely demolished. The temple is at the base of a steep cliff, and is partly excavated in the rock, and partly built of masonry. The built portion is almost wholly destroyed. A portal of red granite which formed its entrance yet remains, bearing the name of Thothmes III., cut over the erased name of Queen Hatshepu. A second granite portal stands behind this, almost close to the rock. At some distance to the left of this are two small chambers, one of which is remarkable for the form of its roof, which is vaulted by horizontal stones, of which the two uppermost meet in the centre, all being cut internally, so as to form an arch. The excavated part of the temple consists of an oblong chamber of moderate dimensions, another of smaller size with a cell on each side, and at the end a sanctuary. All these, except the sanctuary, are of the time of Queen Hatshepu and Thothmes HI., and have vaulted roofs. The sanctuary bears Ptolemaic sculptures, affording a remarkable contrast to the delicate style of those of the chambers which lead to it, and it is flat-roofed. This temple was probably sepulchral.

The isolated hill of the Sheykh’Abd-El-Kurneh (probably a mistake for ’Äbid-El-Kurneh, meaning “the Devotee of El-Kurneh ”), presents a singular appearance from the plain, as on that side it is honeycombed by the entrances of tombs. Several of these, like some of those first mentioned, have porticoes before them hewn in the rock, and many have very interesting paintings, representing scenes of domestic life, funeral ceremonies, arts, trades, &c., in their chapel or chapels. These have unfortunately suffered greatly from the disgraceful Vandalism of European travellers, and the cupidity of the natives which they have encouraged. Farther towards Medeenet-Haboo is a similar isolated hill, called Kurnet-Mara’ee, which contains a fewgrottoes of the same description, and in the valley between this and the main mass of mountain are many other interesting grottoes. At one extremity of this valley, at some distance behind the Rameseum, is a small edifice with a high inclosure of crude-brick walls. It is a temple of Athor, of the Ptolemaic period, and has a small portico and three chambers, in one of which, the side chamber to the left, is a curious sculpture, of which the subject is the judgment of a soul by Osiris. Hence we may infer that this was a temple attached to the necropolis. Beyond the other extremity of this valley is the secluded valley called that of the Tombs of the Queens, from its containing the sepulchres of queens and princesses of Dynasties XVIII., XIX., and XX. These are similar to the Tombs of the Kings, but are not large, nor are the subjects on their walls, which seem generally of little interest, well preserved.

A long and winding valley, the entrance to λvhich is an [9:7:782] opening in the mountains behind the Setheum, leads to two other valleys, that of the Tombs of the Kings, and the Western Valley. Both these contain royal sepulchres, but those of the former are the more important. The sepulchres in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings are twenty-five in number. Nineteen are the mausolea of kings, of a queen with her consort, and of a prince, all of Dynasties XIX. and XX. One tomb is without sculpture, and there is likewise an unsculptured passage running for a considerable distance into the mountain, which may be regarded as an uncompleted tomb. M. Mariette has found the tombs of functionaries in this valley {Mon., 234). Their plan is always the same in its main particulars, but they differ greatly in extent, in consequence of having been begun at a king’s accession, or even before (for one of them is the tomb of an heir-apparent), and continued throughout his reign, like the pyramids of Memphis. Their paintings and painted sculptures likewise do not present remarkable varieties, for they are almost wholly of a religious character, and principally refer to the future state. These subjects are taken from the Book of the Lower Hemisphere, treating of the course of the sun in the twelve hours of the night, and so in the nether world. They are interesting for the manner in which they illustrate the Egyptian religion, and for the beauty of their execution; but their intricate nature forbids any detailed description of them in the present article. The plan of one of the most interesting sepulchres may, however, be described. The tomb of Setee I., commonly called Belzoni’s, since that explorer first opened it since ancient times, is in the freshest state of preservation, except in its outer part, although the miserable barbarism of modern travellers is yearly lessening its beauty. We enter by a staircase, and pass along a steep passage, which ends in a deep pit, now filled up. Thus far the subjects and inscriptions which occupy the walls are unfinished, showing that the tomb was not completed. Immediately beyond the pit, the part discovered by Belzoni begins with a hall 26 feet by 27, supported by four square pillars, the walls of which are covered with very beautiful painted sculptures, including the celebrated procession of the four races. To the right of this is another chamber, supported by two columns, the decorations of which were never begun, having only been drawn in outline. From the left side of the former chamber we descend a flight of steps, which leads to a passage, another flight of steps, and then another passage, ending in a chamber 17 feet by 14, from which we pass into a hall 27 feet square, having six square pillars, and on either side a small chamber. This forms the portico of the great sepulchral hall, the most splendid part of the tomb, which is of an oblong form, 19 feet in length and 30 in breadth, with an arched roof. In the midst, in a depression, was a splendid sarcophagus of alabaster, now in the Soane Museum, and on its removal blocks of stone were found filling up the entrance of an inclined descent, which was cleared for 300 feet by Belzoni, without its termination being discovered. It is not impossible that the king was buried in a chamber at the end of this passage. The great sepulchral hall is covered with beautiful painted sculptures, and on its ceiling are astronomical or astrological representations, resembling the astronomical ceiling of the Rameseum of El-Kurneh. A door in the left side of the sepulchral hall leads to a chamber which has two square pillars, and on the same side is a cell; there is another chamber on the opposite side. A large apartment, which was left unfinished, is behind that in which was the sarcophagus, and is the last of those contained in the tomb, if the inclined descent does not lead to other unknown ones. From the entrance to the end of this chamber is a distance of about 300 feet.

The tomb of Ramses III. is among the most splendid of the royal sepulchres. Its length a little exceeds 400 feet, but from the nature of the rock its sculptures are less delicately executed than those of the tomb of Setee I. In cells on either side of its passage, a little within the entrance, are interesting paintings illustrating manners and customs, in one of which is the celebrated representation of the harpers.

The tombs which have been found in the Western Valley are only four in number, and but two of these contain paintings, those of Amenophis III. and of King Aï, the sun-worshipper who succeeded Khu-n-aten. The former is decorated with paintings in a very good style, but unfortunately they have sustained much damage; the latter is historically interesting as a record of an obscure king, but its paintings are of poor execution.

Nowhere, perhaps, are we so forcibly struck by the feeling of the ancient Egyptians with respect to death and the future state as in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings, and in the sepulchres themselves. The desolateness of the spot, apart from all signs and sounds of life, fitted it for the solemn use to which it was assigned; and those long dark passages, and lofty chambers, on -whose walls we see the awful punishments of the wicked and the rewards of the good,.fitly unveil the most secret mysteries of the Egyptian religion.

Not far south of Thebes, on the western bank, is the large village of Arment, the old Hermonthis, where stands a picturesque temple built by Cleopatra. It has two courts with colonnades, and three chambers around which was also a colonnade, of which but one column now stands. It is of small dimensions, having been the “Typhonium” attached to the great temple of Mentu, the divinity of the place, which has been razed. On the other bank of the river, a little higher, at Tôd, anciently Tuphium, is a small Ptolemaic temple. Not far beyond, and about 20 miles above Thebes, by the course of the stream, are the “Gebeleyn,” or “Two Mountains,” on the western side of the river, where the sandstone begins. The town of Isnè, the ancient Sne, called by the Greeks Latopolis, is likewise situate on the western bank, about twelve miles higher, and is remarkable as containing a very fine Egyptian monument, the portico of its great temple of Kneph. This is in the heart of the modern town, and was much choked with rubbish until cleared by Mehemet Ali. It is supported by twenty-four lofty and massive columns, six in front, and four deep, having capitals of various forms, of which those alone in corresponding positions on opposite sides are of the same description, a deviation from regularity of which we do not see examples previous to the Greek rule. The columns and walls are covered with minute sculptures of the bad style of the period when the portico was erected. —that of the Caesars. It contains the hieroglyphic names of Claudius, Vespasian, Titus, and other emperors as late as Severus. The back is, however, more ancient, for it bears the name of Ptolemy Philometer, being the front of the older temple of which nothing more is known for certain to remain. Upon the ceiling is a zodiac, from which this monument was supposed to have been of very great antiquity before the interpretation of hieroglyphics had been discovered. On the other bank of the Nile, on the site of Contra Latopolis, is a small temple of the Ptolemaic and Roman periods.

A few miles above Isnè, where both the Libyan and Arabian chains approach the river, are the curious remains of Eilethyia (so written in Egyptian geography). There is a small temple of the Ptolemaic time, and two little sacred edifices of the period of the Pharaohs, but the most interesting monuments are the tombs and the fort. The former, which are excavated in a hill, are very remarkable[9:7:783] as illustrating history as well as everyday life, husbandry, &c.; and in one of them is the very curious inscription of its occupant Aahmes, chief of the mariners, recording his services to early kings of Dynasty XVIII. The fort is a large inclosure of crude-brick,^[64. For an account of the Egyptian system of fortification, see Wilkinson in Τrαηs. Soc. Lit., n. s., iv.; and Popular Account of Ancient Egyptians, i. 407-409.] which was a place of importance as early as the Shepherd war, for it is mentioned as the “Fort of Suben,” that is of Eileithyia, in a part of the inscription above mentioned, relating to the time of that war. The goddeu of the place was Suben or Lucina (Eileithyia), who was especially regarded as the protector of Upper Egypt.

Having proceeded about twelve miles to the southward we reach the large village of Adfoo or Edfu, which represents the town called by the Greeks Apollinopolis Magna, the great temple of which yet stands in a comparatively perfect state, and is one of the most stately monuments of ancient Egypt, although of a time at which art had greatly declined. It was dedicated to Har-hut, the god of the place, whom the Greeks called Agathodaemon. Mounds of rubbish around it, as well as the huts of the village, injured its effect, until it was lately cleared by M. Mariette.

The great propylou which forms the front of the temple measures about 226 feet in width, and is, like the rest of the edifice, in a good state of preservation. The sculptures upon its face represent acts of worship by Ptolemy Auletes, who is portrayed slaying prisoners.

The portal between the wings of this propylon is the entrance to the temple, of which the first part is a great court about 161 feet long and 140 broad, with a colonnade along its front and each side, of columns with various capitals supporting covered galleries. At the end is a portico having eighteen columns, six in front and three deep, about 82 feet broad and 46 long, measured within, beyond which are a hall and passages and other chambers, the most important of which is an isolated sanctuary. The wall of the great court is continued so as to inclose the further portion of the temple, leaving a passage around it. The sculptures show that it was begun by Ptolemy Philopator and completed at the end of the Greek monarchy, though an insignificant additional subject was added by Claudius. Not far from the great temple is a smaller one of the sort called Typhonia, containing two chambers, around which runs a gallery supported by Typhonian columns.

About twenty-three miles above Adfoo the mountains on either side, which had for some distance confined the valley to a narrow space, reach the river and contract its course. They are low, but steep and picturesque, and in their western side are seen the entrances of excavations. They are called Gebel-es-Silsileh, a name derived from the earlier Silsilis. The most interesting of the excavations is a rocktemple in which is portrayed the defeat of a negro nation by King Har-em-heb, or Horus, of Dynasty XVIII.; here, also, are subjects depicting acts of worship paid to Nilus and Sebek. To the southward of this, and also facing the river, are the entrances of several excavated tombs, the representations in which are not of a remarka⅛le character. Beyond these are three chapels of the time of Dynasty XIX. On the opposite side are very important quarries, where much of the materials of the great temples was cut, especially under the Eighteenth and subsequent Dynasties.

Beyond Gebel-es-Silsileh, although the mountains recede, the tract of cultivated land is extremely narrow, and sometimes the desert touches the river: this is partly owing to the sinking of the level of the stream, which, as already mentioned, was very anciently restrained by some barrier at Silsilis. About eleven miles above that place is the extremely picturesque temple of 0mbos, placed on a rocky eminence called “Kbm-Umboo,” “the Hill of Urnboo.” It stands within a great inclosure of crude-brick walls, which we see on every side, except that towards the river. There is a portal in this wall of the time of Queen Hatshepu and Thothmes III. The great temple is double, one-half having been dedicated to the worship of Sebek, and the other to that of Har-oer, or Aroëris. It consists of a portico of fifteen columns, of which two have fallen, the foremost being connected by a wall of intercolumniation having two entrances, and behind, there is a smaller portico and remains of chambers, including the two sanctuaries. The earliest name here is that of Ptolemy Philometor (Modern Egypt and Thebes, ii. 282), unless Champoilion be right in saying that the name of Epiphanes is also found in the temple (Lettres, 173), and it appears to have been completed by Ptolemy Auletes. There were also remains here of a smaller Ptolemaic temple which have been washed away by the river.

Nothing remarkable occurs between Ombos and Syene, a distance of about twenty miles. The valley is confined to a very narrow space by the mountains, which take bold forms on both sides near the latter place. Just before we reach it, we see the island of Elephantine, where is the famous Nilometer of the Roman time. The town of Aswan, which represents the ancient Syene, stands amid palm-trees on the eastern bank opposite to Elephantine. It is a considerable place, of greater political than commercial importance, and has succeeded to an older town of the same name, the ruins of which occupy the river’s bank and a granite hill to the south. Among them may be mentioned a pier, which has a well, most probably the Nilometer constructed by ’Amr, the Muslim conqueror of Egypt. In the ruined town is also a small temple of Roman date. Farther to the south is its extensive Arab cemetery, which is full of curious tombstones bearing inscriptions in Cufic characters. In the granite hills to the eastward are the quarries w ι hence were taken the obelisks and very many of the statues which adorned the Egyptian temples.

The bed of the river above Aswân is obstructed by numerous rocks and islands of granite, one of the latter of which, that of Saheyl, is interesting on account of the numerous hieroglyphic tablets and inscriptions at its southern part. This island is almost a mile and a half above Aswan, and at the distance of another mile from it begin the rapids called the First Cataract, caused by the granite rocks, which almost entirely choke the river. The cataract is so inconsiderable, that during the inundation boats favoured by a strong northerly wind can pass it without aid, though at other times it is necessary to hire natives, who drag them through, but then the principal rapid has a fall of only five or six feet (Modern Egypt and Thebes, ii. 294), and that is not perpendicular. Nevertheless the roaring of the troubled stream, and the red granite islands and rocks which stud its surface, through which the boat threads its way, give the scene a wild picturesqueness, until we reach the open stream, less than two miles farther, and the beautiful isle of Philae suddenly rises before the eyes, completely realizing our highest idea of a sacred place of ancient Egypt.

Philae is beyond the proper limits of Egypt, but as it is usual to describe it in noticing Aswân and the rapids, some account will here be given of its very beautiful and interesting monuments. The island is very small, being only a quarter of a mile long, and about 500 feet broad. On its granite rock is a little alluvial soil and some vegetation, with a few date-palms, but its verdure has been exaggerated, and to this it little owes its beauty. It was highly reverenced by the ancient Egyptians as a buiial-place[9:7:784] of Osiris. On.the east side is a small but very picturesque temple, now hypaethral, of the Greek and Roman time, and unfinished. It is 48 feet in width and 63 in length, and has 14 columns with capitals of various forms, connected by intercolumnal walls. The great temple of Isis stands to the westward of this. Its front is formed by a propylon, before which is a kind of court, to be afterwards described. The portal bears the name of Nectanebes IL, but the wings were added by the Ptolemies, making the entire width about 122 feet. Through the portal we enter a court, on the right side of which is a gallery fronted by columns, behind which are several small chambers, and on the left side is a separate small temple of Athor, the main entrance to which is by a door and passage in the left wing of the great propylon. This small temple begins with a portico having four columns with the faces of Athor sculptured in high relief upon each of their sides above the capitals. Beyond this are three chambers behind one another, above the door of the first of which is a Greek dedication by Ptolemy Euergetes IL, and the two Cleopatras. The temple was, however, begun by Epiphanes. The court of the great temple, that of Isis, is bounded by a second propylon of smaller dimensions than the first, forming the entrance to the portico, which is a very elegant structure raised on ten columns, eight of which are at the back and one on each side. It is partly hypaethral, an open space being left between the two columns last mentioned. The beautiful forms of the columns and the bright remains of colour on them and the walls, with the effect of the sunlight through the aperture of the roof, produce a charming effect. Behind this hall are several small apartments, one of which, reached by a staircase, contains very curious sculptures relating to the story of Osiris. The temple appears to have been begun by Ptolemy Philadelphus (whose name is the earliest found there), and was continued under the Roman emperors. The court before the temple remains to be noticed. It is bounded by two galleries with columns in front. One of these is about 250 feet long, and is built close to the western side of the isle, terminating at a small temple of Athor near its southern end. This edifice, w hich is much ruined, was supported by columns with faces of Athor above their capitals, of which six stand; it was raised by Nectanebes II. The eastern gallery, w hich is shorter than the other, is not parallel with it, and thus shows that this court was not part of the great temple, but rather an approach to it. The other remains are of minor importance, and the same may be said of the ruins of a temple on the neighbouring large island of Bigè.

A few words must be said respecting the eastern and western deserts. The latter is remarkable for two valleys besides those called the Oases. The first of these valleys is that of the Natron Lakes to the westward of the Delta, containing four monasteries, the remains of the famous anchorite settlement of Nitriae. To the southward of this, and parallel to it, is a sterile valley called the Bahr-bela-Ma, or “River without Water.” Yet farther to the southward is the Little Oasis (Oasis Parva), about 100 miles from the Nile in 29° E. long., nearly due west of the town of Bahnesè. It contains remains of little interest. Within 200 miles due south of this oasis is another, of which the usual apellation is Wâh ed-Dàkhileh, where, near the town of El-Kasr, is an Egyptian temple of the Roman period. This, according to Sir Gardner Wilkinson, is the most flourishing of the oase≡. About half-way between this oasis and the Nile at Thebes lies the Great Oasis (Oasis Magna). Here, near the town called El-Khârigeh, the ancient Hibe, is a great temple of Amen built by Darius I., and in the same oasis are other ruins of the period of the Ptolemies and Caesars. The Oasis of Jupiter Ammon, that of Seewah, is not far from the coast at a great distance to the westward, and it is not properly included in Egypt. Various Arab tribes occupy this desert, besides the settled inhabitants of the oases.

In the eastern desert must be mentioned the town of Es-Suweys, or Suez (15,000 inhabitants), anciently Arsinoë, at the head of the gulf to which it gives its name. To the southward, a little below 29° lat., are the secluded Coptic convents of St Antony and St Paul, near the sea. Farther south are the porphyry quarries of Gebel-ed-Dukhân, extensively worked under the Romans, and the granite quarries of Gebel-el-Fateereh. Considerably more to the south, at El-Hammâmàt, on the old way from Coptos to Philoteras Portus, are the Breccia Verde quarries, which were much worked from very early times, and have interesting hieroglyphic inscriptions. At Gebel Zabârah are emerald mines, now abandoned as unproductive. At the various mines, and on the routes to them and to the Red Sea, are some small temples and stations, ranging from the Pharaonic to the Roman period. Along the shore of the sea are the sites of several ancient ports, the most important of which were Myos Hormos and Berenice, and also the modern town of El-Kuseyr. The northern part of this desert is occupied by the Ma’âzee Arabs and smaller tribes as far as the Kuseyr road, beyond which are the ’Abâbdeh, an African tribe very different from the Arabs in appearance; and to the south of these, to the east of Lower Nubia, is the Bishâree tribe, a people also of African race.

Statistics. ^[65. For much of the information contained in the present section, the writer is indebted to the industrious work of Mr J. C. M ζ Coan, Egypt as it is, though he has thought it necessary to check it with official reports and other authorities: but it must always be remembered that Egyptian like all Oriental statistics can be accepted only with reserve.]

[In Egypt, as has been well said, HÉtat c ’ est le Khedive. So far as the country itself is concerned the khedive is its personal, absolute, and independent sovereign; but his relations with the Porte are somewhat less simple. When Selim I. of Turkey conquered Egypt at the beginning of the 16th century, the Memlook power was still too strong for complete subjection, and Selim was obliged to allow his new subjects liberal terms. Egypt still retained practical autonomy, the government being in the hands of a council of Memlook beys, presided ; over by a pasha, whose duty it was to look to the annual tribute paid to the Porte, but who possessed little or no actual' pow er. This system was continued till the French occupation, and was re-established when the English army evacuated the country. The Memlooks were still the virtual governors of Egypt, until their massacre by Mehemet Ali. The ambitious designs of this pasha opened the eyes of the Porte to the dangers incurred by so lax a control of a governor unshackled by the council of beys. Menaced with the loss of Syria as well as Egypt, the cause of the sultan was espoused by four of the Great Powers; and the Treaty of 1840, confirmed by the Convention of 1841 limited Mehemet All’s pow er to the vice-royalty of Egypt, hereditable by the eldest male of his family, ordered the continuation of the customary tribute, restricted the military and naval strength of the viceroy, and imposed certain other conditions, thus reducing Egypt once more to the state of a Turkish province. But in the reign of the present ruler a change has taken place in the relations between the sultan and his viceroy. A series of expensive negotiations with the Porte, ending with the raising of the tribute from .£376,000 to <£675,000, procured for Ismail Pasha the title of Khedive, and the right of succession from father to son. The limitation of the Egyptian army [9:7:785] and other restrictions which still remained were removed in 1872 by another firmân, confirming all the rights previously granted, and giving the khedive every substantial attribute of sovereignty, except only theyws legationis. The khedive is therefore virtually an independent sovereign, holding his power on the easy tenure of tribute and military aid in case of war.

The real work of governing is entirely performed by the present energetic and able sovereign. The merely formal business is transacted by a Privy Council and eight ministers—the agents, not the rulers, of the khedive. The Privy Council, presided over by the Prince Hérétier Mehemet Tawfik Pasha, and consisting of the ministers, the Sheykh el-Islâm, and some other functionaries, examines and reports to the khedive on the work of the several departments. The eight ministries are those of (1) Finance, (2) Foreign Affairs, (3) Interior, (4) War, (5) Marine, (6) Commerce, (7) Public Works and Agriculture, and (8) Public Instruction. Besides these there are the sub-departments of the Customs and Post-Office.

The provincial administration (exclusive of the separate governors of the eight “cities ”) is divided among the mudeers of the fourteen prefectures, the Feiyoom now being one, each subdivided into departments and communes, or cantons including several villages, governed by ma-moors, nâzirs, or sheykhs el-beled, appointed by the Government and assisted and checked by councils of agriculture and an administrative council for each canton.

In 1867 the Assembly of Notables was revived, consisting of village sheykhs, <fcc., elected by the communes and meeting once a year to receive from the Privy Council a report of the twelvemonth’s administration. Although the Assembly has not yet attained to the full dignity of parliamentary power, it has considerable weight in the control of state measures.

By the Convention of 1841 the Egyptian army was limited to 18,000 men, but this was raised to 30,000 by the firmân of 1866, and now all restrictions have been done away. The present force may be placed at an average peace strength of 30,000 men, regulated, however, on a short service system, so that not more than half this number are generally at one time with the colours. This army consists of 18 regiments of infantry, 3 battalions each; 4 battalions of riflemen; 4 regiments of cavalry, 6 squadrons each; 4 of field artillery, 6 batteries each (2 mounted); 3 of garrison artillery; and 3 battalions of pioneers. The infantry are armed with the Remington rifle; the cavalry with revolver and lance, or sabre and carbine; the field artillery with 100 Krupp guns and 50 smooth-bore. Besides these there is a reserve of 30,000 men, and an irregular contingent of 60,000 mounted Bedawees. The army is raised by conscription, irregular levies being held every two or three years. All Egyptians of any creed are liable to conscription, except only the inhabitants of Cairo and Alexandria; but immunity may be purchased by payment of a tax. The monthly pay ranges from 20 piastres ( = 4s. 2d.) for a private, to £5 (Egyptian) for a captain, £40 for a full colonel, and £75 for a full general. Under the training of French and American officers, the army has been brought into an admirable state of discipline and efficiency.

The Egyptian navy hardly deserves notice. It consists at present of 2 frigates, 2 corvettes, 4 gunboats, and 2 sloops, all unarmoured.

Mehemet Ali devoted considerable attention to the establishment of colleges and military schools, besides sending young men to Europe for purposes of scientific study. In Cairo and its environs he founded several elementary schools of a higher order than the native schools of the same class; a school of languages; a printing press at Boolâk, from which many valuable publications have issued; and a school of medicine at Kasr-el-’Eynee, between Cairo and Masr-el- ’Ateekah, which has done excellent work. At El-Khankah and in its neighbourhood he placed a military hospital, a school of medicine, a veterinary college, an infantry school, and a school of music; at El-Geezeh a cavalry school; and at Turâ one of artillery. These and similar establishments were well designed and ably carried out. When Mehemet All’s ambitious designs were defeated in 1840 by the action of the Powers, his educational reforms languished, and under ’Abbas the schools were closed and everything returned to the old system. Said Pasha endeavoured to revive Mehemet All’s improvements; but it was reserved for the present khedive entirely to carry out his grandfather’s designs. Besides the revived and newly created military schools, there are two systems of education in Egypt—by the schools established and supported by the Government, and by the old system of mosque education and Arab primary schools,—besides the numerous establishments of the non-Muslim communities. The Government schools are nine in number—the Polytechnic, Book-keeping and Surveying, Law and Languages, Industrial, Medical, Midwifery, two preparatory schools at Cairo, and one at Alexandria. Besides these the Government supports a school for the blind, a normal school, two girls’ schools, three industrial schools, and 23 municipal schools. At the Polytechnic School the course extends over six years, and includes the higher mathematics, chemistry, physics, geology, mechanics, geography, history, drawing, Arabic, and English or French.

Of the mosque colleges, the greatest, not only in Egypt but in the whole Mohammadan world, is the Azhar, where over 11,000 students, coming from every quarter of the Muslim empire, are instructed by 325 sheykhs in the old curriculum of Muslim acquirement. The Arab primary schools, 4000 or 5000 in number, are the regular providers of education for the fellâlieen, who pay either nothing at all, or a merely nominal sum, for being taught to read and recite the Korân, and sometimes writing and very elementary arithmetic. How greatly the educational system in Egypt has been enlarged of late years may be judged from the fact that, under Said Pasha it hardly cost the Government £4000 a year, whilst the educational budget (exclusive of the military schools) now reaches the sum of £40,000, to which the khedive adds £12,500, making a total of £52,500.

Of the schools of non-Muslim communities the Copts have 16, the Greeks 4, the Armenians 1, and the Jews several academies. Besides these there are two undenominational “Universal Schools,” of foreign foundation, where a moderate education, without religious instruction of any kind, is given to all comers, and many schools founded by the American Board of Missions, and Miss Whately’s admirable British Mission School. The proportion of girls’ schools is extremely small, but their existence, and the fact that they receive the warmest support of one of the wives of the khedive, is a hopeful sign.

The public works carried out in Egypt during the present reign would fill a long catalogue, without reckoning the Suez Canal, for an account of which see Canal, vol. iv. p. 789. Railway communication has been established between Alexandria, Cairo, Ismaïlia, Suez, Damietta, the Feiyoom, and Asyoot, the various lines covering over 1200 miles. A Soodân railway, from Wadee Half eh to Hannek, and from near Dunkalah to Khartoom, involving costly and difficult engineering for a length of more than 1000 miles, has been begun with the view of shortening the passage to India, and bringing the produce of the rich southern soil into easier connection with Cairo; these works are, however, at present at a standstill. The canal [9:7:786] system has been greatly enlarged and improved, but a still better result is anticipated from the barrage of the Nile, a plan projected by M. Mougel and now about to be carried out for the khedive by Mr Fowler. In 1871 the work of building a breakwater to defend the New Harbour at Alexandria from the seas caused by the constant southwest winds was begun. The outer breakwater extends above two miles across the mouth of the harbour, inclosing an area of 1400 acres of calm water. The structure rises 7 feet above the highest sea-level, and is of a uniform width of 20 feet. Harbour works have also been constructed at Suez. At a cost of over £180,000, fourteen fine lighthouses have been erected, seven on the Mediterranean and seven on the Red Sea, whereas at the beginning of the reign of the khedive there was but one. Telegraph lines (begun by the enterprise of Said), have been set throughout Egypt, covering nearly 6000 miles, and putting Alexandria into direct communication with Khartoom; and this branch of the public service is managed by English officials. Submarine telegraphs also bring Egypt into communication with Candia and thence with Constantinople and Otranto, and with Malta and thence with England, France, Ac. The post-office was bought by the Government in 1865, and under the management of an English post official has been greatly improved. In about 70 towns and villages offices have been established, and several mails a day are despatched from the chief places.

The manufactures of Egypt have been in a declining state for several centuries. Mehemet Ali tried to promote them, by establishing large manufactories of cottou, silk, and woollen goods, tarbooshes, <fcc., and, especially in Upper Egypt, sugar-refineries. Ibrahim Pasha was much opposed to his father’s policy, and in pursuance of his own views he laid out extensive plantations of olive and other trees, erected powerful steam-engines for the irrigation of his lands, and on all his estates endeavoured to encourage agriculture. It cannot be doubted that had he lived the correctness of his conviction that Egypt is an agricultural, not a manufacturing, country would under his rule have been fully verified. Mehemet Ali introduced cotton and largely cultivated it; the Turkish grandees found that from it they could extract more gain than from other field produce, and large tracts were speedily devoted to its culture. The necessity, however, of excluding the waters of the Nile has caused several destructive inundations; and so long as the cotton growth remained a monopoly of the pasha it was no means of enrichment to the producer. Now, however, that the monopoly is abolished, the trade in cotton is greatly increasing, and this produce will undoubtedly become every year a more important item in the wealth of the country. The old restrictions upon agriculturists have been more or less done away; and the Government, whilst not wholly abandoning Mehemet All’s views on manufactures, is yet alive to the paramount importance of affording every encouragement to agriculture.

The cotton crop in 1875 extended over 871,847 feddans ( = acres, nearly) and produced 2,615,541 quintals (of 110It>) of ginned staple, 1,954,555 ardebbs (of 5 bushels) of seed, and 3,749,446 loads of cotton sticks, altogether reaching a total value of about twelve millions and a quarter. The wheat crop in the same year was estimated at 6,662,632 ardebbs, of the value of E£7,995,158; maize (durah), 10,502,715 ardebbs, = E£8,193,000; beans, 4,575,273 ardebbs, — E<fi4,575,273; barley, 3,103,085 ardebbs, = E£2,394,000; rice, 98,521 ardebbs, - E£738,908. The other crops of Egypt arc chiefly clover, sugar-cane, flax, hemp, tobacco, hinnè, and indigo.

The revenue is derived chiefly from the land-tax, the tax on date-trees, trade licences, the customs, the tobacco duty, railways, and the Mukabalah (of which an account will be given), and village annuities. Of these the land-tax is the principal item, amounting to nearly half the total revenue; but this will be considerably reduced when the Mukabalah comes to an end (in 1885). The whole revenue may at present roughly be placed at £10,500,000. It is very-difficult to estimate the exact amount of direct taxation on the population. One writer places it at 25s. per head per annum; whilst a recent report states that, including the Mukabalah, the annual payment of taxes has lately reached £4! It is certain the taxation at present exceeds the possible returns of the land, and that the fellâheen are compelled to borrow money to pay the taxes. The items of expenditure may thus be roughly summarized general public administration, £1,300,000; civil list, £600,000; tribute to the Porte, £700,000; army, £700,000; the the rest being devoted to the payment of the debt.

The following is an abridgment of the Egyptian budget for 1876
[table]

During the last fifteen years Egypt has acquired the enormous national debt of about £80,393,000. The attempt to Europeanize the country has entailed a vast expenditure. Public works have been carried out at an altogether unnecessary rate of speed, and European contractors have been employed who have not scrupled to drive bargains exceedingly favourable to themselves and ruinous to the Egyptian Exchequer. To these causes of expenditure must be added the dishonesty and extravagance of the Government officials, the waste of money on works which have proved unproductive and useless, and the heavy damages given against the khedive in the extraordinary award of the late emperor Napoleon as arbitrator in the dispute with the Suez Canal Company. To meet the heavy expenses resulting from these causes, five loans have from time to time been raised.

The first was borrowed by Said Pasha in 1862, and amounted to only £3,292,800 nominal, to be repaid in thirty years, interest 7 per cent., and sinking fund 1 per cent. The present viceroy then raised the 1864 loan of £5,804,200 nominal, with interest and sinking fund at 7 and 3'87 per cent., redeemable in 15 years. The next loan, of 1868, redeemable in 1898, was for £11,890,000 nominal (of which only £7,193,334 was received), with apparent interest and sinking fund of 7 and 1 per cent., really ll - 56 and l - 68 pt·r cent, on amount received, or altogether 13∣ per cent.
[9:7:787]

annual charge. The loan of 1873 was for the nominal amount of £32,000,000 at 7 and 1 per cent, interest and sinking fund; hut, as only £20,062,658 was received, the interest and sinking fund became really 11 and l - 62 per cent. The actual amount received was, however, slightly increased by part being paid in Egyptian Treasury bonds. Besides these, in 1866 a railway Joan had been raised, of the nominal amount of £3,000,000 at 7 per cent. This was repaid in 6 annual instalments of £500,000 each, the last being in January 1874. Two loans secured on the Daïra estates of the khedive have been transferred to the state for value received; these are the Anglo-Egyptian loan of 1865 for £3,000,000 at 9 per cent, interest, with sinking fund of 3’27 per cent; and the Mustafa-Pasha loan of 1867 for £2,080,000 at 9 and 3∙4 per cent, interest and sinking fund. The khedive raised also a personal loan secured on his private estates (Daïra) in 1870; £5,000,000 was received, for which £7,142,860 was to be paid back iu twenty years, with interest at 7 per cent on this nominal amount. “None of the Egyptian loans,” Mr Cave observes, “cost less than 12 per cent, per annum, while some cost more than 13} per cent, per annum, and the railway loan even 26'9 per cent, per annum, including sinking funds.”

These loans hardly sufficed to meet tho necessities for which they were raised, and the exorbitant interest charged on the nominal sums, of which the khedive received little more than half, effectually crippled the resources of the country. In 1871 another fatal step was taken. A measure was passed by which a landowner might redeem half his land-tax in perpetuity by paying six years’ tax in advance, either in one paymentor in six yearly instalments. As, however, few but the wealthiest proprietors could afford this additional charge on their incomes, the six instalments were commuted into twelve, a discount of 8∣ per cent, being allowed od each instalment. This composition tax is called the “Mukabalah.” By this measure the Government, for the sake of the immediate possession of about <£27,000,000, will sacrifice from 1885 onwards about £2,500,000 annually of certain revenue. For the overtaxed fellaheen the change is most advantageous, if only they can avail themselves of it; for the Government it nearly resembles suicide.

In 1875 the khedive procured a temporary respite from his difficulties by the sale of the Suez Canal shares to the British Government; and then, at last aware of the critical state of his finances, and of the incompetence of Easterns to mend it, His Highness requested the British Government to provide him with some experienced financier to carry out a thorough reform. In December the Right Honourable Stephen Cave, M.P., accompanied by Colonel Stokes, R.E., and clerks, was sent out, and after some months’ examination wrote an elaborate report on the Egyptian finances. But after Mr Cave’s departure, and the publication of his report, Egyptian credit fell still lower, till in 1876 the khedive, finding himself totally unequal to meet the demands of his creditors, and weary of renewing bonds at ruinous rates, suspended payment for a time. A French scheme was then urged upon him with so much insistance that on May 7 he adopted it in a decree which announced the consolidation of all the state and Daïra loans, and the distribution of a bonus of 25 per cent, to holders of treasury bonds. These bonds had then reached a sum exceeding £20,000,000, and were held chiefly by French firms. The arrangement speaks for itself. It was immediately quashed by the firm actiou of the English Stock Exchange; and the Right Honourable G. J. Goschen, M.P.,and M. Joubert were sent out to attempt the adjustment of the affairs of Egypt. The result was a scheme which the khedive accepted, and which may shortly be described as follows: the private Daïra debt was separated from the state debt; the three small loans of 1864, 1866, and 1867 were reserved to be paid off by the Mukabalah; the bonus on the treasury bonds was cut down to 10 per cent.; and £17,000,000 was converted into a preference stock, secured on railways and harbour dues. The state debt was thus divided into three classes :—unified debt of £59,000,000, iuterest percent., reduced till 1885 by a sinking fund of 1 percent; preference stock, £17,000,000, interest 5 per cent.; and the three short loans, interest 7 per cent., redeemable at 80 instead of 100, and to be paid off by the Mukabalah. Besides these, there is the private Daïra debt of the khedive. The scheme is perhaps the best that can be devised under the present perplexing conditions; and if the Egyptian Government can maintain its revenue and will hold to its engagements there is every probability that the debts will be paid off at the appointed times. When the Mukabalah falls in in 1885 the three short loans will (presumably) have been paid off. Tho preference debt is to be redeemed in 65 years by the operation of a sinking fund of £35,744 a year, and the unified debt in the same time and after a similar manner. With a view to insure the carrying out of these reforms, the khedive has appointed English and French comptrυllers-general, who are intrusted with the collection of the revenue and the appropriation of it to the purposes settled by the financial scheme. A European Commission of the Public Debt has also been appointed for receiving the revenue devoted to the payment of the debt charges; and another commission, composed of three Europeans and two natives, controls the railways and the port of Alexandria. So long as the present arrangement is held to, and if no unforeseen decrease takes place in the revenue, the financial position of Egypt may be considered hopeful. The khedive has been the subject of much censure at the hands of his bondholders. It must however be remembered that he received but half of the sums supposed to have reached him. Of the £45,000,000 received he has paid back over £30,000,000 in interest, Ac., and £10,000,000 went in the Suez Canal indemnity, so that only £4,000,000 could have been squandered. That the khedive is no financier is obvious; but he seems honestly determined to pay his debts, and if there was any dishonesty in the matter of the loans it was not on the khedive’s side.

The principal exports from Egypt are cotton, cereals, and sugar. In 1875, 163,912,336 lb of raw cotton was exported to Great Britain, at the value of £6,668,340; and the total cotton export is estimated at over two millions and a half of quintals. Of beans, 490,257 ardebbs were exported in 1875; of wheat, 836,997 ardebbs; of sugar, 986,000 quintals. Maize, barley, flax, natron, dates, hinnè, and other produce form less important items in the list of exports. The total value of exports is estimated at between twelve and thirteen million of pounds. The imports are estimated at about five millions and a half of pounds and consist chiefly of manufactured goods, coals, oil, wine, machinery, &c. Of the whole commerce about 70 per cent, is with Great Britain. There is also a considerable transit trade, which, however, has necessarily diminished since the opening of the Suez Canal.

The Egyptian measures are—the fitr, or space measured by the extension of the thumb and first finger; the shibr, or span; and the cubit (of three kinds, = 22 j, 25, and 26J inches). The measure of land is the feddân, very nearly equal to the English acre, subdivided into 24 keerâts, and each of these into 330 (formerly 333⅜) kasabehs, or rods, the kasabeh being a square measure with side of 22 kabdehs, each equalling 6∣ inches. The ardebb is equal to about 5 bushels, and is divided into 6 weybehs, and each weybeh into 24 rubas.
[table]

The French metrical system has been established by the khedive, but has not yet been generally adopted.

The standard unit of currency is the kirsh, or piastre ( — about 2Jd.), which is coined in gold pieces of 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 piastres ·. silver of 1, 2∣, 5, 10, 20 piastres.
[9:7:788]

Copper coins of 5, 10, 20 paras (or faddahs, 40 to the piastre) and 1 piastre are also coined. The kees, or purse, of 500 piastres, is equal to about £5, 2s. 6d. The khazneh, or treasury, consists of 1000 purses. 97J piastres are given for the English pound sterling. Besides the regular

Egyptian currency, European coins of all kinds are commonly employed in Egypt, especially the English sovereign, the French Napoleon, the Venetian sequin, the Spanish doubloon and dollar, the 5-franc piece, and the Constantinople coins. (s. l. p.)] (κ. s. p.)
