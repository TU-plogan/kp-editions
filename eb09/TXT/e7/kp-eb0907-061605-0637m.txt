EBERH zYRD, surnamed im Bart {Barbatus), count and afterwards first duke of Wiirtemberg, was born December 2, 1445. He was the second son of Count Ludwig I., who died in 1450; and he succeeded his elder brother, Ludwig IL, at the age of twelve (1457). The guardianship of the young count was assumed by his uncle, Count Ulrich, and he had for tutor the learned John Nauclerus. Coveting power and careless of learning, he profited little by the learning of his tutor; and at the age of fourteen he succeeded in throwing off the restraint of the guardianship, and assumed the government. But instead of discharging its duties he thought only of indulging his passions, and for a time led a wild, reckless life. By some means he was brought to serious reflections, and we find him, according to a custom which had not become wholly extinct, undertaking in 1468 the pilgrimage to Jerusalem. He also visited Italy, and made acquaintance with some of the most famous scholars of the age. His marriage with Barbara, daughter of Lodovico di Gonzaga, contributed to the amendment and elevation of his character. He began to study and to take a practical interest in the promotion of the new learning, and at the instigation of his wife he founded, in 1477, the university of Tübingen. Hither came, in 1481, [9:7:617] the young advocate John Reuchlin, who lectured on Greek at the university and took his degree of doctor of laws. Count Eberhard conceived a great liking for him, appointed him his private secretary, and named him councillor. In the spring of 1482 Eberhard, accompanied by Reuchlin, visited Rome, had an audience of Pope Sixtus IV., and received from him the Golden Rose. On his return he visited Florence, and enjoyed the society of the group of scholars gathered around Lorenzo de’ Medici. It was in the same year that Eberhard, by the treaty of Minzingen, put an end to the evils which had arisen from a division of the county made in 1437 between his father and his uncle Ulrich, a3 representatives of the two lines of Urach and Stuttgart, and secured the future indivisibility of Wiirtemberg, and the right of primogeniture in his own family. The treaty was made under the guarantee of the empire, and was sanctioned by an assembly of prelates, knights, and landed proprietors. By a limitation of the power of the prince agreed to at the same time, Count Eberhard became the founder of the constitution of Wurtemberg. He made Stuttgart his place of residence, and retained Reuchlin in his service till his own death. Eberhard sympathized with the desire that was daily strengthening for a thorough reformation in the church; and in his own dominions he rendered great services by his regulation of convents. Some of these institutions he secularized. Though a lover of peace, he knew how to bear the sword when war was necessary; and by his courage, wisdom, and fidelity to his engagements he secured the esteem and friendship of the emperors Frederick III. and Maximilian I., as well as that of other princes of his time. He was one of the leading members of the Grand Swabiau League formed in 1488, and took part in the liberation of Maximilian, then king of the Romans, from his imprisonment at Bruges. In recognition of his great services the emperor at his first diet, held at Worms in 1495, raised Eberhard, without any solicitation on his part, to the dignity of duke, confirming at the same time all the possessions and prerogatives of his house Duke Eberhard did not live long to enjoy his new dignity. He died at Tübingen on the 25th of February 1496. He had two children by his marriage; but these died in their infancy, and with him the line of Urach became extinct.
