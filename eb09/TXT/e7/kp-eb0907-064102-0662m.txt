ECK, Johann Maier von (1486-1543), the most indefatigable and important opponent of Martin Luther, was born 13th November 1486, at Eck in Swabia. His father was a peasant, who becoming bailiff of the village, added Eck to the family name Maier. The son entered in his eleventh year the university of Heidelberg, from which he went to Tubingen, where he took his master of arts degree in his fourteenth year, and afterwards studied theology. He then went to Cologne, and afterwards to Freiburg, where, besides studying jurisprudence and mathematics, he taught philosophy. In 1506 he published a work on logic. From this time he appears to have devoted his attention chiefly to theology; and his skill and versatility in scholastic disputations having attracted considerable notice, the duke of Bavaria, in 1510, presented him to the chair of theology in the university of Ingolstadt. In 1515 he took part in a public disputation at Bologna, and in 1516 in one at Vienna, on both occasions gaining great admiration. In 1518 he circulated privately his Obelisci against Luther’s thesis on the mass. Luther intrusted his defence to Carlstadt, who, besides answering the insinuations of Eck in 400 distinct theses, declared his readiness to meet him in a public disputation. The challenge was accepted, and the disputation took place at Leipsic in the following year. It lasted for three weeks, and Luther as well as Carlstadt opposed himself to Eck. The general impression was that victory rested with Eck; but apparently success only embittered his animosity against his opponents, for from that time his whole efforts were devoted to Luther’s overthrow. He induced the universities of Cologne and Louvain to condemn the Reformer’s writings, and in 1520 went to Rome to obtain strict regulations against what he called the “Lutherans.” He returned with the celebrated papal bull against Luther’s writings, and with the commission to publish it, but at Leipsic met with so bad a reception from the inhabitants, that he was compelled to take refuge in the Pauline convent. Eck took a leading part in the Augsburg diet of 1530, and in the conferences at Worms in 1540 and at Ratisbon in 1541. He died in 1543. He is said to have been a bad linguist, aud not an able theologian, but to have possessed great readiness and fluency, a retentive memory, and remarkable dexterity in sophistical argumentation. Among his numerous writings is a translation of the Bible, which was written to supersede that of Luther, but met with no success.
