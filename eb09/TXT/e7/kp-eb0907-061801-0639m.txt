EBERT, Friedrich Adolf (1791-1834), a very eminent bibliographer, was born at Taucha, near Leipsic, July 9, 1791. He received his early education partly from his father, preacher to the Georgenhaus at Leipsic, and partly at the Nicholas School. At the age of fifteen he was appointed to a subordinate post in the town library of Leipsic, in which his literary tastes, early awakened, were fostered and strengthened. He studied theology for a short time, first at Leipsic and afterwards at Wittenberg, but, by the advice of a friend, renounced it in favour of history. After the close of his academical studies, he made his appearance as an author by the publication in 1811 of a work on public libraries, and in 1812 of another work entitled Hierarchie in religionem ac literas commoda. In the following year he took part in the reorganization of the Leipsic University Library, and in 1814 was appointed secretary to the Royal Public Library of Dresden. The same year he published F. Taubmann's Leben und Verdienste, andin 1819 Torquato Tasso, a translation from Ginguené with annotations. Anxious to turn to good account the rich resources open to him in the Dresden library, he undertook the work on which his reputation chiefly rests, the Allgemeines bibliographische Lexikon, the first volume of which appeared in 1821, and the second in 1830. This was the first work of the kind produced in Germany; but nevertheless it had a higher aim and a more scientific character than its non-German precursors. In 1823 Ebert was called to the post of chief librarian and professor at Breslau, and at the same time was offered that of librarian to the duke of Brunswick at Wolfenbüttel. He accepted the latter. But early in 1825 he returned to Dresden as public librarian; he was soon after named private librarian to the king, and in 1828 chief librarian and aulic councillor. Among his other works are— Die Bildung des Bibliothekars (1820), Geschichte und Beschreibung der Königlichen öffentlichen Bibliothek in Dresden (1822), Zur Handschriftenkunde (1825-27), and Culturperioden des obersachsischen Mittelalters (1825). Ebert was a contributor to various journals and encyclopaedias, and took part in the editing of Erseh and Gruber’s great work. He died at Dresden, November 13, 1834, in consequence of a fall from the ladder in his library a few days before.
