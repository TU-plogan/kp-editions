EISENBURG, or Vas Vârmegye, a county of Western Hungary, on the Styrian frontier, inclosed on the north, east, and south by the counties of Sopron, Veszprim, and Szala, and on the west by the Styrian circle of Gratz. Its area is 1536 geogr. square miles. Though mountainous in the west and south, the land is generally fertile. The chief river is the Raab, which receives the Pinka, Sorok, Gyöngyös, and other streams. The natural and agricultural products consist of coals, mineral waters, quicksilver, corn, wine, fruit, and tobacco. Game, wild fowl, and fish are also plentiful. The population in 1870 amounted to 331,602, of whom nearly three-fourths were Roman Catholics, the rest chiefly Protestants and Jews. According to nationality about 140,000 are Magyars, 120,000 Germans, and the remainder Croatians and Slovaks. The principal town is Szembathely or Stein-am-Anger.
