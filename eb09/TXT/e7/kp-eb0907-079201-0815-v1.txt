EJECTMENT, in English law, was an action for the recovery of the possession of land, together with damages for the wrongful withholding thereof. In the old classification of actions, as real or personal, this was known as a mixed action, because its object was twofold, viz., to recover both the realty and personal damages. The form of the action as it prevailed in the English courts down to the Common Law Procedure Act, 1852, was a series of fictions, among the most remarkable to be found in the entire body of English law. The following outline is condensed from the work of Mr Sergeant Adams :—A, the person claiming title to land, delivers to B, the person in possession, a declaration in ejectment, in which C and D, fictitious persons, are plaintiff and defendant. C states that A has devised the land to him for a term of years, and that he has been ousted by D. A notice signed by D informs B of the proceedings, and advises him to apply to be made defendant in D’s place, as he, D, having no title, does not intend to defend the suit. If B does not so apply, judgment will be given against D, and possession of lands will be given to A. But if B does apply, the court allows him to defend the action only on condition that he admits the three fictitious averments—the lease, the entry, and the ouster—which, together with title, are the four things necessary to maintain an action of ejectment. This having been arranged, the action proceeds, B being made defendant instead of D. The names used for the fictitious parties were John Doe, plaintiff, and Richard Roe, defendant, who was called the casual ejector. The explanation of these mysterious fictions is this. The writ of ejectione firmce was invented about the beginning of the reign of Edward III. as a remedy to a lessee who for years had been ousted of his term. It was a writ of trespass, and carried damages, but in course of time the courts of common law added thereto “a species of remedy neither warranted by the original writ nor demanded by the declaration, viz., a judgment to recover the term and a writ of possession thereupon.” The next step was to extend the remedy to cases of disputed title to freeholds. This was done indirectly by the claimant entering on the land and there making a lease for a term of years to another person; for it was only a term that could be recovered by the action, and to create a term required actual possession in the granter. The Jessee remained on the land, and the next person who entered even by chance was accounted an ejector of the lessee, who then served upon him a writ of trespass and ejectment. The case then went to trial as on a common action of trespass; and the claimant’s title, being the real foundation of the lessee’s right, was thus indirectly determined. These proceedings might take place without the knowledge of the person really in possession; and to prevent the abuse of the action a rule was laid down that the plaintiff in ejectment must give notice to the party in possession, who might then come in and defend the action. When the action came into general use as a mode of trying the title to freeholds, the actual entry, lease, and ouster which were necessary to found the action were attended with much inconvenience, and accordingly Lord Chief-Justice Rolle during the Protectorate substituted for them the fictitious averments already described. The action of ejectment is now only a curiosity of legal history. Its fictitious suitors were swept away by the Common Law Procedure Act of 1852. A form of writ was prescribed, in which the person in possession of the disputed premises by name and all persons entitled to defend the possession were informed that the plaintiff claimed to be entitled to possession, and required to appear in court to defend the possession of the property or such part of it as they should think fit. In the form of the writ and in some other respects ejectment still differed from other actions. But now by the Judicature [9:7:793] Act, 1875, all actions are begun and carried on in the same manner, and an action for the recovery of land will, with very few exceptions, proceed in the same manner as any other action.
