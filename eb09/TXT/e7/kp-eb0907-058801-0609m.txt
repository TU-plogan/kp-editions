E is the second vowel-symbol and the fifth letter in our alphabet. In its original form among the Phoenicians it represented the rough breathing—our h: we have seen that A represented the smooth breathing. As the Greeks had the sound h at a very early period, it might have been expected that this symbol would have been taken by them with its original value. But the want of symbols to denote the vowels was apparently felt to be more imperative; therefore all the Phoenician symbols (corresponding to the Hebrew aleph, he, ayin) were taken to denote the vowelsounds ct, e, o respectively. The form of the symbol E has varied little from the earliest Greek times to our own. In old Latin it is sometimes, but rarely, found in the form 11. The typical sound of E in almost all languages is one of those which we denote generally by a in English, e.g., in the word fate— that is, one of the simple sounds between A (English ah) and I (English ee), which are produced by raising the tongue gradually from its lowest position (at A) to its highest position (at I): in this scale of sounds the lips are not employed. The most clearly distinguished of these sounds are (1) that in men, (2) that in fair, (f) that in fate. It will be observed that these sounds have here different symbols; and if these were consistently employed in English we should not have much reason to complain of our spelling; but e has also the I-sound in here and see; ai in wait has the same sound as a in fate; and a has many sounds. Other languages employ diacritical marks to distinguish these sounds; thus in Italian we have è and e, called “open” and “close” e respectively; these correspond very nearly to (2) and (3) mentioned above. It is probable that the same distinction of sound was given in Latin by employing ae to express the open e: at least open e is commonly found in Italian words which were written in Latin with ae, or with e short. It is possible that in Greece a similar distinction of close open e was expressed in early times by the symbols e (epsilon) and η (eta); but in Attica, at least after 403 b.c., the distinction seems to have been rather quantitative than qualitative. For the history of eta see article H. It is clear that in a perfect alphabet we ought to have at least three distinct symbols between A and I: we ought not to be compelled to distinguish the simple sounds by diphthongs or other modifications. Indeed yet more symbols would be desirable, for there are other sounds in this scale, which, however, are not easily distinguished from the above except by a practised ear.

It is probable that ee in English of the 16th and 17th centuries had the sound still heard in Scotland in words like ell, i.e., the simple e in our men pronounced long: this is not unlike the open e, but the back of the tongue is lower. But ee had acquired its present I sound in the last century.
