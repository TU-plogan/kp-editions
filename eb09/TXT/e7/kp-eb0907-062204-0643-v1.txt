ECCLESIA, in Grecian antiquity, the general assembly of Athenian citizens, who met from time to time to discuss public affairs. Ecclesiae were of two kinds, ordinary and extraordinary. The first of these were held, according to the laws of Solon, four times in each prytany, or period of thirty-five days; while the others were only summoned on some pressing emergency. When any measure of unusual importance was to be publicly debated, the people were summoned from the country by special messengers. An assembly thus convened was called a cataclesia. Much discussion has taken place as to the exact days of the month on which the ecclesiae were held; but the result has only been to prove either that there were no days invariably fixed for them, or that we have no data by which to determine accurately what these days were. In Ulpian it is stated that when there were three assemblies a-month, the first fell on the eleventh, the second on the twentieth, and [9:7:623] the third about the thirtieth of the month. The likelihood is that they were held at regular intervals though the days were not absolutely fixed. Ecclesiae were originally held in the Agora or Forum. The place of meeting was subsequently removed to the Pnyx, and afterwards to such of the greater temples as might be most convenient. The Pnyx lay to the west of the Areopagus, and commanded an extensive view. It was partly within the city walls, and had an area of about 12,000 square yards. On its northern side, cut out of the solid rock, was the bema or hustings from which the speakers addressed the people. From this tribunal a splendid view of the principal buildings of the city might be had. The right of assembling the people lay with the prytanes, or presidents of the senate or Council of Five Hundred, who both advertised beforehand the business to be discussed, and on the day of meeting sent round a crier to remind the citizens that their presence was required. In times of war, however, or other national crises, the generals of the army sometimes assumed this privilege, though it was necessary for them in doing so to give notice of their intention by a public proclamation. They also sometimes claimed the right of preventing the ecclesia from assembling; but their claims to this privilege were not generally recognized. Such of the citizens as refused to attend were fined, and six magistrates called lexiarchs were appointed to collect the fines. To assure a full meeting, the custom was ultimately introduced of paying the poorer classes a small sum for their attendance. This sum was originally an obolus, but after the time of Pericles it was raised to three, According to the usual order the proceedings of an ecclesia were commenced by a lustration or ceremonial purification of the place of assembly. The victims sacrificed were usually sucking pigs, whose blood was sprinkled round the boundary of the assembly. The crier next offered up a prayer to the gods for guidance, after which the business for which the assembly had been convened was introduced. According to the laws of Solon, the crier first called upon citizens above fifty years of age to speak and then upon all others; but this distinction was afterwards abolished, and the discussion was open from the commencement to all citizens of whatever age. The vote was generally taken by show of hands. In certain special cases, however, such as those affecting individual rights, the ballot was used. The decision to which the assembly came was called Αpsephisma. The ecclesia was sometimes adjourned from one day to the next, and it generally broke up at once if any of those present declared that he had seen an unfavourable omen or if thunder and lightning occurred. The word ecclesia came to mean any assembly regularly convened, and in New Testament Greek it is used to denote the assembly of Christians in any particular place, or the Christian church.
