QUINTUS SMYRNAeUS, a late epic poet of Greece, sometimes called Quintus Calaber because his poem was discovered at Otranto in Calabria. Next to nothing is known of him. He appears to have lived in the latter part of the 4th century, shortly before Nonnus. He speaks of himself as having tended sheep in his youth at Smyrna (bk. xii. 308 sq.~). His epic in fourteen books, known as τα μeθ' 'Όμηρον or the Posthomerica, takes up the tale of Troy at the point where Homer’s Iliad breaks off, i.e., after the death of Hector, and carries it down to the capture of the city by the Greeks. It describes the doughty deeds and deaths of Penthesilea the Amazon (bk. i.), Memnon, son of the Morning (bk. ii.), and Achilles (bk. iii.)j the funeral games in honour of Achilles (bk. iv.); the contest for the arms of Achilles and the death of Ajax (bk. V.); the exploits of Neoptolemus and Deiphobus, the deaths of Paris and Oenone, the capture of Troy by means of the wooden horse, the sacrifice of Polyxena at the grave of Achilles, the departure of the Greeks, and their dispersal by the storm (bks. vi.-xiv.). The poet has no originality; in conception and style his work is closely modelled on Homer. His materials are borrowed from the cyclic poems from which Virgil also drew, in particular the Aethiopis of Arctinus and the Little Iliad of Leschcs. The style is clear, but the poem is flat and tedious, in spite of the abundance of similes with which the poet seeks to relieve its dulness.

The first edition of Quintus Smyrnaeus was published by Aldus Manutius in 1504 or 1505; in this century there have been editions by Tychsen, 1807, Lehrs in the Didot edition of Hesiod, &c., 1841, and two editions by Köchley in 1850 (Weidmann) anti 1853 (Teubner). Sainte-Beuve has an essay on him.
