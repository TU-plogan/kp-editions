QUINCY, a city of the United States, the county seat of Adams county, Illinois, occupies a limestone bluff 125 feet above low-water mark on the east bank of the Mississippi at the extreme western point of the State. The river is crossed here by the great bridge of the Hannibal and St Joseph Railroad. Quincy Bay, an arm of the river, is the finest natural harbour for steamboats on the upper Mississippi. By water Quincy is 160 miles above St Louis, and by rail 263 miles south-west of Chicago via Galesburg. Commanding an extensive view, being well built, having excellent waterworks, and forming an important centre in the railway system of the region, Quincy is both an attractive and a prosperous place, with very miscellaneous industries. Among the public buildings are the court-houses, St Johnâ€™s cathedral (1877), a medical college (1873), a city library, and several hospitals and asylums. The population in 1860 was 13,718; in 1870, 24,052 (1073 coloured); and in 1880, 27,268 (1508 coloured). Laid out in 1825 or about three years after the arrival of the first white settler, Quincy was made a town in 1834, and a city in .1839.
