QUEENSTOWN, formerly Cove of Cork, a market town and seaport in the county of Cork, Ireland, is picturesquely situated, 13 miles east south-east of Cork, on the south side of Great Island, on the slope of an eminence rising somewhat abruptly above the inner Cork harbour. It consists chiefly of terraces, rising above each other, and inhabited by the wealthier classes. On account of the mildness of the climate it is much frequented by valetudinarians in winter. Previous to the American War the Cove of Cork was a very small fishing village, but within the last fifty years it has rapidly increased. It received its present name on the occasion of the visit of Queen Victoria in 1849. The harbour, which is 4 miles long by 2 broad, and is defended by the Carlisle and Camden Forts at its entrance, and by Fort Westmoreland on Spike Island, can afford shelter to a very large fleet of vessels. The port is the calling station for the American mail steamers. Among the principal buildings are the new Catholic cathedral for the diocese of Cloyne, and the Protestant Episcopal church for the united parishes of Clonmel and Temple Robin. A fine promenade, over a mile in length, connects Queenstown with Rushbrook, a favourite watering-place. The population of Queenstown in 1871 was 10,334, and in 1881 it was 9755.
