QUEEN’S COUNTY, an inland county in the province of Leinster, Ireland, is bounded N.W. and N. by King’s County, E. by Kildare and a detached portion of King’s County, S. by Carlow and Kilkenny, and W. by Tipperary. Its greatest length from east to west is about 35 miles, and its greatest breadth from north to south about 30 miles. The area is 424,854 acres, or about 663 square miles. The surface is for the most part level or gently undulating, but in the north-west rises into the elevations of the Slieve Bloom Mountains, the highest summit being Ardern, 1733 feet. Like the level country, they belong to the limestone formation, but are wrapped round with folds of Old Red Sandstone. In the central part of the county there is a large extent of bog. The south-east portion is included in the Leinster coal-field. Iron ore, copper, and manganese are found in small quantities. Potter’s clay is plentiful; and slate, sandstone, and marble are quarried in some places. Nearly the whole of the [9:20:171]

county is drained either by the Barrow, which has its source in the Slieve Bloom Mountains, and forms at various points the boundary with King’s County, Kildare, and Carlow, or by the Nore, which enters the county from Tipperary near Borris-in-Ossory, and flows east and then south till it reaches Kilkenny. The lakes are few and small, the largest being Lough Anaghmore on the northwestern boundary. The Grand Canal enters the county at Portarlington, and runs southwards to the Barrow in Kildare, a branch passing westwards 12 miles to Mountmellick.

Agriculture.— The climate is dry and salubrious. Originally a great extent of the surface was occupied with bog, but by draining much of it has been converted into good land. For the most part it is very fertile except in the hilly districts towards the north, and there is some remarkably rich land in the south-east. The total extent under crops in 1884 was 129,617 acres, of which 73,536 acres were under tillage and 56,081 acres under meadow and clover. Of the 42,755 acres under corn crops 639 acres were under wheat, 24,467 acres under oats and 17,639 acres under barley. Of the 30,601 acres under green crops, 15,888 were under potatoes, and 12,077 under turnips. Dairy farming is extensively carried on. The total number of cattle in 1883 was 78,496, of which 20,421 were milch cows. There were 70,530 sheep, 33,834 pigs, 5433 goats, and 249,619 poultry. Horses and mules numbered 14,494, and asses 5742.

Agriculture forms the chief occupation, but the manufacture of woollen and cotton goods is carried on to a small extent.

Railways.— The Great Southern and Western Railway crosses the country from north-east to south-west with stations at Portarlington, Maryborough, Mountrath, and Ballybrophy. At Portarlington a branch passes westward to Mountmellick; there is also a branch passing southward from Maryborough, and another passing westward from Ballybrophy.

Adminstration.— The county is divided into eleven baronies, and contains 53 parishes and 1156 townlands. Ecclesiastically it is in the dioceses of Leighlin and Ossory, with portions in those of Kildare, Killaloe, and Dublin. Judicially it is in the home circuit. Assizes are held at Maryborough, the county town, and quarter sessions at Abbeyleix, Borris-in-Ossory, Carlow-Graigue, Maryborough, Mountmellick, and Stradbally. There are fifteen petty sessions districts. The poor-law unions of Abbeyleix and Donagh-more are wholly within the county, and portions of those of Athy, Carlow, Mountmellick, and Roscrea. The county is included in the Dublin military district, and there is a barrack station at Maryborough.

Population.— Within the last forty years the population has diminished by more than one-half. In 1841 it numbered 153,930, which in 1871 had diminished to 79,765, and in 1881 to 73,121. The following were the largest towns :—Mountmellick( 3126), Maryborough (2872), Portarlington (partly in King’s County) (2357), and Mountrath (1865).

History.— Anciently the territory now included in Queen’s County was divided between the districts of Leix, Offaly, Clamnaliere, and Ossory. In the reign of Philip and Mary, it was made shire ground under the name of Queen’s County, in honour of the sovereign, the place chosen for the county town being named Maryborough. Three miles south of Stradbally is Dun of Clopook, an ancient dun or fort occupying the whole extent of the hill, and there is another large fort at Lugacurren. Aghaboe, where there are the ruins of the abbey, was formerly the seat of the bishopric of Ossory. There are no remains of the Abbey of Timahoe founded by St Mochua in the 6th century, but in the neighbourhood of the site there is a fine round tower. Among the principal old castles are the fortress of the O’Moores in ruins occupying the precipitous rock of Dunamase, three miles east of Maryborough, Borris-in-Ossory on the Nore, and Lea castle on the Barrow, 2 miles below Portarlington, erected by the Fitzgeralds in 1260, burnt by Edward Bruce in 1315, again rebuilt, and in 1650 laid in ruins by the soldiers of Cromwell.
