QUEENSBERRY, James Douglas, second Duke of (1662-1711), was the eldest son of William, third earl and first duke, high treasurer of Scotland, and Isabel Douglas, sixth daughter of William, first marquis of Douglas. He was born at Sanquhar Castle 18th December 1662, and educated at the university of Glasgow, after which he spent some time in foreign travel. He sided with the prince of Orange at the Revolution, and was appointed a privy councillor, and colonel of the Scotch troop of horse guards. On the death of his father in 1695 he succeeded him as extraordinary lord of session, and was also appointed keeper of the privy seal. In 1702 and 1703 he was appointed by Queen Anne secretary of state, and commissioner to the parliament of Scotland. In the latter year he was deprived of his offices, but he was again restored in 1705, and in the following year was constituted high commissioner on the part of Scotland for carrying out the Treaty of Union between the two kingdoms, which, chiefly owing to his influence and skill, was completed in 1707. In recognition of his services he received a pension of Â£3000 per annum, and on the 26th May 1708 was created a British peer by the title of duke of Dover. On 9th February 1709 he was appointed third secretary of state. He died 6th July 1711.
