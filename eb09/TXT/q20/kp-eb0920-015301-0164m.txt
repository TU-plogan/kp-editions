QUANTAMPOH, or Kuntampoh, a town of the Gold Coast region of western Africa, situated about 80 miles north-east of Coomassie, in 7° 36' N. lat. and 1° 4' W. long. According to Captain Brandon Kirby, who was the first white man to reach the place, it had in 1881 a resident population of 15,000, and traders passed through it to the number of about 25,000. Formerly it was one of the great ivory-marts of this part of Africa, and it is still a centre of the cola-nut trade, the slave trade, &c.
