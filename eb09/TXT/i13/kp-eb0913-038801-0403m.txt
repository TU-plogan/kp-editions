ISMAILÍA, a town of Egypt, nearly in the centre of the isthmus of Suez, on the western shore of Lake Timsah (which is traversed by the canal), and connected with the railway which joins Zagazeg, and consequently Alexandria and Cairo, with Suez. It was laid out in 1863, and for a time had a population of about 3000, mainly engaged in the construction of the canal. The broad macadamized streets and regular squares bordered with trees give it an attractive appearance; and it has besides the advantage, a rare one in Egypt, of being surrounded on three sides by flourishing gardens. The Quai Mehemet Ali, which lies along the canal for upwards of a mile, contains the châlet long occupied by M. de Lesseps. At the end of the quay are the works for supplying Port Said with water; and there is a bathing establishment on Lake Timsah. Ismailia is a separate mohafza or governorship, and has a vice-regal palace and a court of first instance. The population was returned as 3062 in 1872, and as 1897 in 1877. On the other side of the lake are the so-called Quarries of the Hyaenas, from which the building material for the town was obtained.
