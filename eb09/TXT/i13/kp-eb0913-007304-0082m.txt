INGELHEIM. Oberingelheim and Niederingelheim, two contiguous market-towns of Germany, in the Hessian province of Rhine Hesse, circle of Bingen, are situated on the Hessian Ludwig Railway and on the Saiz near its confluence with the Rhine, 9 miles west-north-west of Mainz. Oberingelheim, formerly an imperial village, has an old Evangelical church with painted windows representing scenes in the life of Charlemagne, a Catholic church, and a synagogue. Its industries are the manufacture of wine and papermaking. The population of Oberingelheim in 1875 was 2846, and of Niederingelheim 2474.

Niederingelheim is, according to one tradition, the birthplace of Charlemagne, and it possesses the ruins of an old palace built by that emperor between 768 and 774. The building contained one hundred marble pillars, and was adorned with sculptures and mosaics from Italy. It was extended by Frederick Barbarossa, and continued to be a favourite residence of the emperors till 1356, when Charles IV. resigned it to the Palatinate. The building suffered much damage during the Bavarian feud of 1504, the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War, and the French invasion in 1689. Only few remains of it are now standing, but some of the pillars are still to be found in different parts of Germany. Inside the boundaries there is an old church, apparently dating from the time of Frederick I. See Hilz, Der Reichspalast zu Ingelheim, Oberingelheim, 1868.
