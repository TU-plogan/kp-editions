ISMAILA, or Gondokoro, a famous mission-station and market-place in the territory of the Bari negroes on the right bank of the White Nile, about 330 miles, according to Baker, above the confluence with the Bahr Giraffe, and about 200 miles below the northern end of Lake Albert Nyanza, in 4° 54' 5'' N. lat. and 31° 46' 9" E. long. The name Ismailia is more strictly applicable only to the military post established by Baker in 1871, and Gondokoro, as it is the more ancient, is still the more ordinary designation. In former times Gondokoro was a great centre of the ivory and slave trade; and, though the site is now almost forsaken for ten months of the year, there is still a considerable ivory market held in December and January. In connexion with the mission instituted by Pope Gregory XVI. in 1846, the pro-vicar Knoblecher founded a station at Gondokoro in 1851, the principal station being at Khartum. A succession of misfortunes, including the death of Knoblecher in April 1858 and a famine in 1859, led to the final abandonment of the place. An interesting series of meteorological observations taken at Gondokoro will be found in Atti dei Lincei, 1860-61.
