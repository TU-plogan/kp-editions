ISLA, JoséFrancisco de (1703-1781), Spanish satirist, was born at Segovia in 1703, and became a member of the Society of Jesus, in which he distinguished himself both as a teacher and as a preacher; on the expulsion of his order from Spain in 1767 he betook himself to Bologna, where after some years of impaired health he died in 1783. His first literary experiment was the Juventud Triunfante (“Triumph of Youth,” Salamanca, 1727), a cleverly disguised satirical account of a festival celebrated in 1727 at Salamanca in honour of two young Jesuits who had recently been canonized by Benedict XIII., iu which he was assisted by a brother priest named Losada; it was followed iu 1746 by his Triuηfo del Amor y de la Lealtad: Dia Grande de Navarra, being an account df the extravagant ceremonies with which the accession of Ferdinand VI. of Castile had been celebrated in Pampe-lona. This was written in so delicate a vein of satire that at first the parties chiefly ridiculed felt really flattered, and expressed their gratitude to the author; ultimately, however, its true meaning was discerned, and so strong was the reaction that he had to leave the locality. The work on which Isla’s claim to a place in the history of the literature of his country rests, however, is his Historia del Famoso Predicador Fray Gerundio de Campazas, in which in course of an imaginary biography of a preaching friar named Gerundio many of the absurdities that deformed the Spanish pulpit at that time are ably held up to ridicule. The first volume appeared at Madrid in 1758, duly approved by the ecclesiastical authorities, who probably were not unwilling that the faults then glaringly prevalent among preachers should be chastized and if possible corrected; so great was the offence given, however, to the religious orders, and especially to the Dominicans, by the causticity of Fray Gerundio, that the royal authority was at last called in to prohibit the book. The second volume, which therefore could only appear surreptitiously, is dated “Campazas” (i.e., Madrid), 1770, and like the first bears on the title page the name of Don Francisco Lobon de Salazar as its author. An anonymous translation by Thomas Nugent (The History of the famous preacher Friar Gerund de Campazas, otherwise Gerund Zotes) appeared in London, in two volumes, in 1772. Six volumes of Sermones, written between 1729 and 1754, and published in 1792, show that Isla’s own high reputation as a preacher was not undeserved; and his Cartas Familiares (6 vols., Madrid, 1785-86) are written iu an easy and attractive style. He is also well known iu the Peninsula as the eminently successful translator of Gil Blas (Gil Blas de Sxηtillaηa vueltο ά su patria, printed at Madrid in 1787), although his strenuously asserted theory that La Sage had borrowed that popular story wholesale from a Spanish source is now entirely exploded.
