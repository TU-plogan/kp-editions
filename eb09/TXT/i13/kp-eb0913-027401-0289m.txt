IRENE (752-803) was the wife of Leo IV., emperor of the East. A poor but beautiful Athenian orphan, she speedily added the confidence to the love of her feeble husband, and at his death in 780 was left by him sole guardian of the empire, and of their young son Constantine VI. Seizing the supreme power in the name of the latter, Irene’s first endeavours were to revive the orthodox image-worship, which she had secretly cherished, although compelled solemnly to abjure it in the life-time of her iconoclastic father-in-law and husband. In 784 she obtained the elevation of Tarasius, a partisan of her own, to the patriarchate; and, at first suffering the laws against image-worshippers to fall into disuse, she assembled a council of clergy at Nicaea in 787 to discuss the whole question anew. An attempt to hold the council at Constantinople in the preceding year had been frustrated by the iconoclastic zeal of the soldiers. Under the auspices of a ruler whose wishes were so clearly known, the decision of this second council of Nice could take only one direction, and the Iconoclasts were hurled from their supremacy (vol. xii. p. 713). So long as Constantine remained a child, Irene was able to combine his interests and her own, and to rule wisely and faithfully; but as the prince approached maturity he began to grow restive under her autocratic sway. An attempt to free himself by force was met and crushed by the empress, who in her first indignation demanded that the oath of fidelity should thenceforward be taken to her name alone. The discontent which this occasioned swelled in 790 into open resistance, and the soldiers, headed by the Armenian guard, formally proclaimed Constantine VI. as the sole ruler. A hollow semblance of friendship was maintained between Constantine and Irene, whose title of empress he confirmed in 792; but the court, the army, and the capital were divided between rival factions, and that which supported the mother against her son grew daily in number and strength. Constantine perceived his danger too late to avert it; and when he saw the conspiracy ripe for action he could only flee for aid to the provinces. But even there he was surrounded by those who were already too deeply implicated in treason to refuse to complete their perfidy. Seized by his attendants on the Asiatic shore of the [9:13:275] Bosphorus, the emperor was carried a captive back to the palace at · Constantinople; and there, by the orders of his inhuman mother, in the very porphyry chamber where he first saw the light, his eyes were stabbed out by fierce blows of a murderous dagger. An eclipse of the sun and an obscurity of seventeen days were attributed by the common superstition to the horror of heaven at this crime. Irene, having thus removed her rival, reigned in prosperity and splendour for five years. She is said to have endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne; but according to the Greek writers, who alone mention it, the scheme was frustrated by Aetius, one of her favourites. In 802 the patricians, upon whom she had lavished every honour and favour, conspired against her, and placed the avaricious Nicephorus on the throne. The haughty and unscrupulous princess, “who never lost sight of political power in the height of her religious zeal,” who, hailed by the church as a second Helena, the mother of another great Constantine, had revealed herself to the world as a second Athaliah, was forced in her exile in Lesbos to support herself by the daily toil of her distaff. She died the following year. Her religious zeal has given her a place among the saints of the Greek Church.
