ITINERARIUM. This Latin word, equivalent to road-book, is more particularly employed to designate the descriptions still extant of the ancient Roman roads and routes of traffic, with the stations and distances. It is usual to distinguish two classes, Itineraria Adnotata or Scripta and Itineraria Picta, — the former having the character of a book, and the latter being a graphic indication of the route in the form of a chart. Of the Itineraria Scripta the most important are :—(1) It. Antonini (see Antonini Itinerarium and Antoninus), which consists of two parts, the one dealing with roads in Europe, Asia, and Africa, and the other with familiar sea-routes,—the distances usually measured from Rome (the better MSS. probably represent a revision dating from the time of Diocletian; edited by Tobler, St Gall, 1863); (2) It. Hierosolymitanum or Burdigalense, which belongs to the 4th century, and contains the route from Bordeaux to Jerusalem and from Heraclea by Rome to Milan (see Pindar in Verlιandl. of the Berlin Academy, 1860; A. de Barthélémy in Revue Archeol., 1864; Aurès, Concordance des voies apolliηaires, &c., Nîmes, 1868); (3) It. Alexandri, containing a sketch of the march-route of Alexander the Great, mainly derived from Arrian and prepared for Constantius’s expedition in 340-345 a.d. (first ed. by Mai, Milan, 1817, since by C. Miiller in Diibner’s Armanus, Paris, 1846, and by D. Volkmann, Naumb., 1871; see Kluge, De itiη. Alexandri, Berlin, 1861). A collected edition of the ancient itineraria was issued by Fortia d’Urban, Paris, 1845. Of the Itineraria Picta only one great example has been preserved. This is the famous Tabula Peutingeriana, which, without attending to the shape or relative position of the countries, represents by straight lines and dots of various sizes the roads and towns of the whole Roman world. The best edition is by Desjardins, Paris, 1868.
