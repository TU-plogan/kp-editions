ISCHL, a favourite watering-place in the district of Gmunden, Upper Austria, is beautifully situated on the peninsula formed by the junction of the rivers Ischl and Traun, and is surrounded by high mountains, presenting scenery of the finest description. It has mineral springs and numerous brine and brine-vapour baths. The brine used at Ischl has in 16 oz. 233 grains of chloride of sodium (common salt) and 15 grains of other solids. The principal buildings include the casino, erected in 1875, the town church, with fine frescoes, the theatre, the official buildings, and the imperial villa surrounded by a beautiful park. Ischl first came into repute in 1822, and since that time the yearly advent of the imperial family and of many of the Austrian nobility has made it one of the most fashionable and prosperous spas of Europe. In the neighbourhood is a very productive salt-mine, which has been worked for more than three hundred years. The place has some trade in wood, gypsum, and chalk. The population in 1869 was 6842.
