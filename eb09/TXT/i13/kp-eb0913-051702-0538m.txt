ITHACA, the chief town of Tompkins county, New York, U.S., is prettily situated in a township of the same name on the Cayuga Inlet, 1⅛ miles from the southern end of Lake Cayuga, and 142 miles west by south of Albany. It is at the junction of several railways, has gas and water works, and carries on some commerce, of which the shipping of coal from the Pennsylvanian anthracite district forms an important constituent. The manufactures include agricultural implements, paper, glass, leather, and machinery. On an eminence to the north-east rise the handsome buildings of Cornell university, chartered in 1865 and opened in 1868, in which a marked characteristic is the prominence given to the study of agriculture and the mechanical arts. Sage College was presented to the university by the Hon. H. W. Sage, on condition that women should have the same advantages for education as men. The public library of Ithaca was built and stocked at a cost of £13,000 by the same munificent citizen whose endowment of the university is commemorated in its name. The neighbourhood of Ithaca is remarkable for the number of its waterfalls, of which Ithaca Fall, 160 feet high by 150 feet broad, is the chief. The population of the town in 1880 was 9864.
