IRIS. The iris flower belongs to the natural family Iridacex, of the class monocotyledons, and to the petaloid division with inferior ovary and only three stamens, (the outer series), being thus distinguished from the Amaryllis family, which has six stamens. They are handsome showy-flowered plants, the Greek name iris having been applied on account of the hues of the flowers. Two of the species are British,— I. Pseudacorus, or yellow flag, and the I. foetidissima, the foetid iris or roast-beef plant, with bluepurple rarely yellow flowers. The former species is widely distributed; the latter is English, although naturalized in Scotland and Ireland. The roasted seeds of I. Pseudacorus have been used as a substitute for coffee. Iris florentina, with white or pale blue flowers, is a native of the south of Europe, and is the source of the violet-scented orris root used in perfumery. Iris versicolor, or blue flag, is indigenous to North America, and yields “iridin,” a powerful hepatic stimulant. Ims germanica of central Europe, “the most common purple Fleur de Luce” of Ray, is the large common blue iris of gardens, the bearded iris or fleur de luce. From the flowers of Iris florentina a pigment—the “verdelis,” “vert d’iris,” or iris-green, formerly used by miniature painters—was prepared by maceration, the fluid being left to putrefy, when chalk or alum was added. The garden plants known as the Spanish iris and the English iris are both of Spanish origin, and have very showy flowers. Along with some other species, as I. reticulata and I. persica, both of which are fragrant, they form great favourites with florists. All these just mentioned differ from those formerly named in the nature of the underground stem, which is tuberous and not a rhizome as in I. Pseudacorus, florentina, &c. Modern botanists separate these bulbous irises from the genus Ims, and place them apart in the genus Xiphium, the Spanish iris,— I. Xiphium of the older botanists being now known as Xiphium vulgare. As defined by Baker, Xiphium includes 15 species, all from the Mediterranean region and the East, and Iris 81 species, mostly from the northern temperate region. Remains of three species of Ims have been met with in a fossil state, in rocks of Tertiary age.
