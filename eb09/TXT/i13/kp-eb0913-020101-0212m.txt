INVESTITURE, in feudal phraseology, means the act of giving corporal possession of a manor or office,—an act which was usually conjoined with some significant ceremonial, such as the delivery of a branch, a banner, or some other appropriate symbol of the thing conveyed. Investiture with staff and ring was during and after the 11th century the name given to the ceremony by which ecclesiastical dignitaries were admitted by the civil power to possession of the temporalities of their office. The word investiture (from “vestire,” to put in possession; see Ducange) is later than the 9th century; the thing itself is an outcome of the feudal system. Under the Frankish monarchy the idea came very early into vogue that the right of nominating bishops lay with the sovereign,—an idea that gained currency all the more widely, especially in Germany, as the territorial and temporal character of the bishoprics and abbacies, with their various immunities and privileges of coinage, toll, market, and the like, gradually came into prominence, and their spiritual nature and functions were proportionally obscured. It was indeed but logical that ecclesiastics, so far as they were the holders of lands, should not be exempted from the ordinary obligations of feudatories to their suzerain; nor was this view seriously disputed until after the middle of the 11th century, when the views of Hildebrand (afterwards Pope Gregory VII. ), who aimed at asserting the absolute freedom of the church from all secular control, began to prevail at Rome. Thus a Roman synod in 1063 forbade all clergymen from accepting churches at the hands of laymen; and in 1068 a direct collision took place at Milan between the German court, which had invested a bishop in the usual way, and the populace, who under papal influence insisted on the appointment of one who had been canonically elected in accordance with the views of the reforming church party. In 1075 (the second year of his pontificate) Gregory VII. in a council held at Rome(Labbé, Cone., vol. xii., ed. 1730) in the most stringent terms deposed .every bishop, abbot, or inferior ecclesiastic who should receive investiture from any lay person, interdicted any one who should be guilty of rebellion from all communion in the favour of St Peter and from all fellowship with the church, and imposed a similar sentence on any emperor, duke, marquis, count, or other secular person who should presume to grant such investiture of bishopric or inferior dignity. The conflict between the empire and the Roman See, which began with this decree, was carried on with varying success throughout the whole of that pontificate, and was continued by Gregory’s successors, with more than one unsuccessful effort at an adjustment, until in the concordat of Worms (1122) it was agreed between Henry V. and Calixtus II., on the one hand, that the emperor should surrender to the church the right of investiture by the ring and the pastoral staff, grant to the clergy throughout the empire the right of free election, and restore the possessions and feudal sovereignties which had been seized during the wars in his father’s time and his own; while, on the other hand, it was conceded by the pope that all elections of bishops and abbots should take place in the presence of the emperor or his commissioners, and that every bishop elect in Germany should receive, by the touch of the sceptre, all the temporal rights, principalities, and possessions of the see, excepting those which were held immediately of Rome. It was also stipulated that in all other parts of the empire (Italy and Burgundy) the royalties should be granted to the freely elected bishoυ within six months after consecration. Later, [9:13:202] the imperial control over the election of bishops in Germany came to be in practice much curtailed, partly by the tacitly changed relations between the empire and its feudatories, partly by explicit concessions wrung at various times from individual emperors (Otto IV. in 1209, Frederick II. in 1213); but the principles of the concordat of Worms continued theoretically to regulate the tenure of bishoprics and abbacies until the dissolution of the empire in 1806.

The question of investitures never assumed an aspect of first rate importance in France, partly because the bishoprics there partook less than in Germany of the nature of secular principalities, partly because at an early period in the dispute the sovereigns voluntarily yielded the leading claims of the church party. In England an arrangement was come to as early as 1105 between Pascal II. and Henry I., in virtue of which the king gave up the right to invest with staff and ring, but retained the right to nominate his bishops and to exact from them the oath of allegiance. A certain freedom of election, somewhat similar to that which still exists (but see Bishop), was first conceded under Stephen, and confirmed by John in 1215.
