ISAAC I., Comnenus, Roman emperor of the East from 1057 to 1059, was the son of a gallant officer under Basil II., named Manuel Comnenus, who on his deathbed commended his two sons Isaac and John to the emperor’s care. Basil caused them to be carefully educated at the monastery of the Studium, and afterwards advanced them to high official positions. During the disturbed reigns of Basil’s seven immediate successors, Isaac, serving in the army, acted prudently and cautiously; and, when the insults of Michael, the eighth from Basil, stung the nobles and generals into rebellion, Caracalon, the leader of the conspiracy, induced the rebels to prcclaim Isaac emperor. Michael, conquered in one battle, was forced to assume the monastic habit, and Isaac ascended the throne in August 1057. The first care of the new emperor was to reward his noble partisans with appointments that removed them from Constantinople, and his next was to repair the beggared finances of the empire. He revoked numerous pensions and grants conferred by his predecessors upon idle courtiers, and, disregarding the charge of sacrilege, and meeting the insolent menaces of the patriarch of Constantinople by a decree of exile, resumed a proportion of the revenues of the wealthy monasteries. Isaac’s only military expedition was against the Hungarians and Patzinaks, who began to ravage the northern frontiers in 1059. Shortly after his successful return he was seized with an illness, and believing it mortal appointed as his successor Constantine Ducas, to the exclusion of his own brother John. Although he recovered from his illness, Isaac did not resume the purple, but, retiring to the monastery of the Studium, spent the remaining two years of his life as a humble monk, alternating menial offices with literary studies. His Scholia to the Iliad, and other works on the Homeric poems, are still extant in MS. Isaac died in the year 1061. He was a good and just prince, and his reign justified his choice as emperor. He was grave and reserved, and, more affable in deed than in word, offended many by his haughtiness and soldierlike brusqueness; while the fact that he coined money with the image of a drawn sword was attributed to his arrogance and impiety. His great aim was to restore and maintain the early splendid organization of the government, and his reforms, directed to that end, though unpopular with the aristocracy and the clergy, and not understood by the people, certainly contributed to stave off for a little while longer the final ruin of the Byzantine empire.
