IVORY, Vegetable. The plant yielding the vegetable ivory of commerce is known to botanists as' Phytelephas macrocarpa, Ruiz and Pavon. It is a native of South America, occurring chiefly on the banks of the river Magdalena, Colombia, always found in damp localities, not only, however, on the lower coast region as in Darien, but also at a considerable elevation above the sea. It is mostly found in separate groves, not mixed with other trees or shrubs, and where travellers tell us even herbs are rarely met with, “the ground appearing as if it had been swept.” The plant is severally known as the “Tagua” by the Indians on the banks of the Magdalena, as the “Anta” on the coast of Darien, and as the “Pullipunta” and “Homero” in Peru. It is a stemless or caulescent palmlike plant, the top of which is crowned with from twelve to twenty very long pinnatifid leaves. The plants are dioecious, the males forming higher, more erect, and robust trunks than the females. The male inflorescence is in the form of a simple fleshy cylindrical spadix covered with flowers; the female flowers are also in a single spadix, which, however, is shorter than in the male. The fruit consists of a conglomerated head composed of six or seven drupes, each containing from six to nine seeds, and the whole being enclosed in a walled woody covering forming altogether a globular head as large as that of a man. A single plant sometimes bears at the same time from six to eight of these large heads of fruit, each weighing from 20 to 25 lb. In its very young state the seed contains a clear insipid fluid, which travellers take advantage of to allay thirst. As it gets older this fluid becomes milky and of a sweet taste, and it gradually continues to change both in taste and consistence until it becomes so hard as to make it valuable as a substitute for animal ivory. In their young and fresh state the fruits are eaten with avidity by bears, hogs, and other animals. The seeds, or nuts as they are usually called when fully ripe and hard, are used by the American Indians for making small ornamental articles and toys. They are imported into Britain in [9:13:525] considerable quantities, frequently under the name of “Corozo” nuts, a name by which the fruits of some species of Attalea are known in Central America,—their uses being chiefly for small articles of turnery. The question of the position of this plant in the vegetable kingdom is one upon which botanists have been much divided. The plant has at different times occupied the attention of such well-known botanical authorities as Ruiz and Pavon, who gave to it its scientific name of Phytelephas macrocarpa, and of Martius, Morren, Humboldt, Bonpland, Spruce, and others, by whom it has been considered respectively to be near to the Palmeae or the Pandaneae, or to belong to a separate and distinct order, the Phytelephasieae of Brongniart. This order is now placed by Le Maout and Decaisne between Palmeae and Paudaneae, and Phytelephas is of course retained in it as the type,—one other genus only, that of Wettiηia, being included.
