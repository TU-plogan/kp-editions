INGULPHUS [Ingulf], abbot of Crowland, for a long period believed to be the author of the Historia Monasterii Croylandensis, was born of English parents. The account of him given at the conclusion of the Historia has been shown to be incorrect in several particulars, but according to the authority of Ordericus Vitalis, who visited Crowland three years after the death of Ingulf, he became secretary to William, duke of Normandy, and after taking part in a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, lived as a monk in Normandy, where he rose to the rank of prior. After the accession of William to the throne of England, he in 1085 received the abbatial stall of Crowland, Lincolnshire, where he remained till his death, December 16, 1109. Through his influence with the Conqueror he secured for the abbey many valuable privileges and immunities, besides the reconstruction and enlargement of the building itself, which had been greatly damaged by the Danes in 870. The only manuscript of the History of Ingulf now known to exist is the Arundel manuscript, No. 178, in the British Museum, which breaks off at the same point as that published by Sir Henry Savile in the Scriptores Rerum Anglicarum post Redam, London, 1596. Other four manuscripts are known to have been at one time in existence; and a more complete copy with a continuation by Peter de Blois was printed by Fulman in vol. i. of the Rerum Anglicarum Scriptores veteres, Oxford, 1684. The authenticity of this work was, however, disputed by Sir Francis Palgrave in the Quarterly Review for September 1826, and the errors which it contains show beyond doubt that it must have been written by a later author, and entirely destroy its value as an historical authority. The work, edited by H. S. Riley, forms vol. xxix. of Bohn’s Antiquarian Library. Two elaborate papers by Mr Riley in opposition to its authenticity are contained in the Archaeological Journal, March and June 1862. A full account of it is also given in Hardy’s Rerum Britannicarum Medii Aevi Scriptores, vol. ii., 1865.
