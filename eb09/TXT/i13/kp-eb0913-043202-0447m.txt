ISSIK-KUL, a large lake of Central Asia, lying in a deep basin between the Trans-Ili Ala-tau and the Tian Shan mountains, and extending from 76° 10' to 78° 20' E. long. The greatest length from west-south-west to eastnorth-east is 120 or 125 miles, and the greatest breadth 33 miles, the area being estimated at not less than 2260 square miles. The name Issik-Kul is Kirghiz for “warm lake,” and, like the Chinese synonym Zhe-hai, has reference to the fact that the lake is never entirely frozen over. The surface is variously stated at 4475 (Semenoff) and 5300 (Golubeff) feet above the sea. Towards the east the valley strikes well in among the mountains in the direction of the Santash Pass (6650 feet), and it is traversed by two parallel streams, the Tub and the Jirgalan, which form the most important affluents of the lake. On the south the Tian Shan mountains, or, as that part of the system is locally called, the Terskei Ala-tau, do not come down so close to the shore as the mountains on the north (the Kungei Ala-tau), but leave a strip 5 to 13 miles broad. The water is too salt to be fit for drinking. Fish are remarkably abundant, especially in the bays, the principal species being carps (Cyprinus, 0reimιs, and Schizothoraf).

Issik-Kul begins to appear in history in the end of the 2d century. It was by this route that the tribes driven from China by the Huns found their way into the Aralo-Caspian basin. The Usuns settled on the lake and built the town of Tchi-gu, probably at the mouth of the Tub, where remains of stone buildings are said to exist below the λvater. Peculiar remains of the Usun sculptures quite distinct from those of the Calmucks or the Kirghiz, and articles of household furniture, such as copper kettles of great size, are sometimes found. The town of Tchi-gu still existed in the 5th century, but after that there is no mention of it in the Chinese historians. It is to Hwen T’sang, the Buddhist pilgrim, that we are indebted for the first account of Issik-Kul based on personal observation. In the beginning of the 14th century Nestorian Christians reached the lake and founded a monastery on the northern shore, indicated in the Catalan map of 1374. Timur skirted the southern shore in the beginning of the 15th century. It was not till 1856 that the Russians made acquaintance with the district.
