IRAK ARABI, or Irak el Arabi, to which the name Irak is more properly applied, is the district between the Tigris and Euphrates, and from the Euphrates west to the desert, its northern limit being from Anah on the Euphrates to Tekrit on the Tigris. It corresponds to the land of Chaldaea or Lower Mesopotamia. There is a town Irak in the district, about 20 miles east of the Euphrates.
