ISHMAEL (⅛J⅛', “God hears”; ⅛ατ∕λ), the son of Abraham by his Egyptian concubine Hagar, was born when his father was eighty-six years old, received circumcision along with Isaac when thirteen years of age, and some three or four years later (apparently in his sixteenth year) was, on account of the jealousy of Sarah, who had seen him “playing” (Hebrew), turned out of doors along with his mother. It had been foretold to his mother before his birth that he should be “a wild ass among men,” and that he should dwell “before the face of” (that is, to the eastward of) his brethren. It is subsequently stated that after leaving his father’s roof he “grew, and became an archer, and dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.” It is also related that he was present at the burial of Abraham. His twelve sons are enumerated by their “villages” and “encampments” in Gen xxv., where also (ver. 18) their locality is indicated by the expressions that “they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur that is east of Egypt, and he settled to the eastward of his brethren” (Heb.). Of the twelve names given, only a few have historical associations apart from the Biblical records. Nebajoth and Kedar suggest the Nabataei and Cedrei of Pliny (v. 12), the first-mentioned of whom were an important Arab people after the time of Alexander, and for some time both before and after the Christian era formed an independent kingdom (Nabatene). Dumah may perhaps be the same as the Domata of Pliny (vi. 32) and the ∆oυ∕*∈0α or ∆oυ∕zcu‰ of Ptolemy (v. 19, 7; viii. 22, 3), and Jetur is obviously the Ituraea of classical geographers. The word “Ishmaelite” is sometimes used in Scripture in a wide sense, which includes such families as the Midianites (Judg. viii. 24), who, according to Gen. xxv., are children of Keturah. On the other hand, no connexion is alleged between the Ishmaelites and the Hagarites (1 Chr. v. 10) or Hagarenes (Ps. Ixxxiii. 7), the ΑγpαΓot of Ptolemy and Strabo. According to the Mahometan Arabs, who recognize Ishmael as their ancestor, he lies buried with his mother in the Kaaba in Mecca.
