INNOCENT V., pope from January 20 to June 22,1276, was a native of Tarantasia in Burgundy, where he was born in 1225. In early life he joined the Dominican order, in which he acquired great fame as a preacher. The only noteworthy feature of his brief and uneventful pontificate was the practical form assumed by his desire for union with the Eastern Church. He was proceeding to send legates to the Greek emperor in connexion with the recent decisions of the council of Lyons when he died. He was the author of several works in philosophy, theology, and canon law, including commentaries on the Pauline epistles and on the Sentences of Peter of Lombardy, and is sometimes referred to as “famosissimus doctor.” His predecessor was Gregory X., and he was succeeded by Hadrian V.
