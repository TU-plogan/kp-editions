ISTRIA (anciently also Histria, in German Istrien, and formerly Histerreicli), a margraviate of Austria, forming the southern part of the Küstenland crownland, is contained in the peninsula which, bounded on the north by the districts of Trieste, Görz, and Carniola, stretches southwards into the Adriatic Sea, between the Gulf of Trieste (Sinus Tergestinus), and the Gulf of Quarnaro (Sinus Flanaticus). The area of the official district, which includes Veglia, Cherso, Lussino, and other smaller islands on the south-east coast, is 1908 square miles, of which 1545 belong to the peninsula itself. The surface is mountainous, especially in the north and east regions, which are occupied by offshoots from the Julian Alps. Monte Maggiore (4573 feet) in the north-east is the highest summit. The Quieto in the west and the Arsa in the east, neither of which is navigable, are the principal streams. The west coast abounds in convenient bays and harbours, of which Pola, an imperial naval station, is the chief; but the steep and rocky east coast is beset with shallows and islets, and is much exposed to the prevailing winds, the Sirocco from the south-south-east and the Bora from the north-east. The climate of Istria, although it varies with the varieties of surface, is on the whole warm and dry. The soil is not unfertile, but its resources are far from being fully developed. About one half of the total area is occupied with scanty grass and pasture land, while timber and the various annual crops divide the remainder in different proportions. Wheat, oats, potatoes, and rye are grown in the north, and in the south wheat, maize, rye, olives, vines, and melons. The harvest of 1872 yielded 46,410 bushels of wheat, 157,385 of rye, 165,800 of oats, and 158,200 of maize; and the value of the total agricultural produce was £950,000. Beech and oak timber (good for shipbuilding), gall-nuts, oak-bark, and cork are also produced. The minerals include coal, alum, quartz, and good building stone. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in a seafaring life, in fishing, and in preparing salt for fishcuring. Shipbuilding, sheep and cattle rearing, and the manufacture of oil, wine, and bricks are also noteworthy industries. The best sorts of wine are made near Capo d’Istria, Muggia, Isola, Parenzo, and Dignano; and the oil of Istria was famous even in Roman times. The trade of the peninsula is unimportant. The roads are fairly numerous, and a railway, lately opened, with a branch to Rovigno, connects Pola with Trieste. Istria is divided into the six government districts of Capo d’Istria, Parenzo, Pisino, Pola, Volosca, and, for the islands, Lussino. The estates of Istria, which meet at Parenzo, consist of 3 bishops, 5 representatives of the landed proprietors, 8 representatives of the towns, 12 representatives for the other and rural communities, and 2 representatives of the chamber of commerce at Rovigno. Two-thirds of the people are Slavs, although among these there are many differences of dress and dialect. The remaining third, on the coast and in the towns, is almost entirely Italian. The population in 1869 was 254,905, of whom 35,917 belonged to the islands: 278,218 was the official estimate at the end of 1879.

The modern Istria occupies the same position as the ancient Istria or Histria, known to the Romans as the abode of a fierce tribe of Illyrian pirates. It owed its name to an old belief that the Danube (Ister, in Greek) discharged some of its water by an arm entering the Adriatic in that region. The Istrians, protected by the difficult navigation of their rocky coasts, were only subdued by the Romans in 177 b.c. after two wars. Under Augustus the greater part of the peninsula was added to Italy, and, when the seat of empire was removed to Ravenna, Istria reaped many benefits from the proximity of the capital. After the fall of the Western empire it was pillaged by the Longobardi and the Goths; it was annexed to the Frankish kingdom by Pippin in 789; and about the middle of the 10th century it fell into the hands of the dukes of Carinthia. Fortune after that, however, led it successively through the hands of the dukes of Meran, the duke of Bavaria, and the patriarch of Aquileia, to the republic of Venice. Under this rule it remained till the peace of Campo Formio in 1797, when Austria acquired it, and added it to the north-eastern part which had fallen to her share so early as 1374. By the peace of Pressburg, Austria was in 1805 compelled to cede Istria to France, and the department of Istria was formed; but in 1813 Austria again seized it, and has retained it ever since. Sαggiο di bibliοgrafa Istriaηa (Capodistria, 1864) contains a classified bibliography of the province.
