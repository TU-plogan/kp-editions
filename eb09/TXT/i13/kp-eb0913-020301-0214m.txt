ION, of Chios, one of the five Greek tragic poets of the canon, was born in Chios, probably in the 74th Olympiad, —485-480 B.c. Although he seems to have lived much in his native island, where he met Sophocles in 441 b.c., he paid frequent visits to Athens, making the acquaintance of Aeschylus, and becoming a warm admirer of Cimon and a severe critic of the rival statesman Pericles. His first tragedy dates from the 82d Ol., between 452 and 449 B.c.; and he is mentioned as third to Euripides and Iophon in the tragic contest of 429 b.c. In a subsequent year he gained both the tragic and dithyrambic prizes, and in honour of his victory gave ajar of Chian wine to every Athenian citizen,—a gift which would imply an ample fortune. From a passage in the Peace of Aristophanes (830 seqj}, which was produced in 421 b,c., it is generally concluded that Ion died before that year. The names and a few fragments of eleven of Ion’s plays remain; the latter give him a place only inferior to the three great tragic masters of Greece. He is credited by the scholiast on Aristophanes (loc. citj) with having composed comedies, dithyrambs, epigrams, paeans, hymns, scholia, encomia, and elegies; and he is the reputed author of a philosophical treatise on the mystic number three. His historical or biographical works were five in number, and included an account of the antiquities of Chios.
