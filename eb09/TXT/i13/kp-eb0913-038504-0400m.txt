ISÈRE, a department of south-eastern France, formed from the southern part of the old province of Dauphiné, is bounded on the N. by the department of Ain, E. by Savoie and Hautes-Alpes, S. by Hautes-Alpes and Drome, and W. by Drôme, Loire, and Rhone. It lies between 44° 43'and 45° 43' 19" N. lat., and between 4° 43' 32" and 7° 6' 9" E. long., being about 100 miles long from northwest to south-east and 60 miles broad from north-east to south-west. It derives its name from the river Isère, which flows through it from north-east to south-west. The Rhone, with several tributaries, is the other chief stream. Lake Paladuc is the largest of several lakes in the department. The surface is mountainous, especially in the south-east, which is occupied by lofty offshoots of the Alps, some of whose summits are covered with perpetual snow. The Belledonne, the Grandes-Rousses, the Oisans, the Grande Chartreuse, famous for its monastery, the Vercors, the Lans, and the Dévoluy are the chief groups and ranges which are found either wholly or partly within Isère. The highest point is the Aiguille du Midi (9800 feet). Towards the north and west the country gradually slopes down in fertile terraces to the Rhone. The river valleys are remarkable for their extent and fertility; that of Graisivaudan is reckoned one of the richest in France. The climate of Isère varies according to the irregularity of the surface, but is on the whole colder and ruder than is usual at its latitude. Agriculture occupies about four-fifths of the inhabitants, although less than half the total area is suited for cultivation. Wheat, barley, rye, oats, buckwheat, maize, potatoes, hemp, colza, and fruit, and, on the southern slopes, vines, walnuts, mulberries, and almonds, are the principal crops. Valuable pastures, on which mules and large flocks of sheep are bred, extend up the mountain to meet the large forests stretching down from the snow-line. Silkworms are reared easily and profitably; fish is exported in considerable quantity to Paris; and the cheese of the department is much esteemed. Gold and silver are found in small quantities. The chief minerals are coal, lignite, and iron; but copper, lead, mercury, zinc, and antimony, with marble, gypsum, granite, porphyry, and slate, are also worked. After agriculture the chief industry is the working of the minerals; glovemaking occupies about 20,000 persons in and around Grenoble; while the department is the leading district of France for the manufacture of paper. Wine, felt, silk, linen, cloth, beet-root sugar, straw-hats, brandy, glass, and other commodities are also manufactured. There is trade in iron, steel, and other metals, cement, lime, grain, wine, liqueurs, and gloves. Isère is divided into the arrondissements of Grenoble, Vienne, La Tour-du-Pin, and Saint Marcellin, with 45 cantons and 558 communes. The chief town is Grenoble. The total area is 3200 square miles, and the population in 1866 was 581,386, and in 1876 581,099.
