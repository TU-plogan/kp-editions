1. Properties of Iron.— The peculiar physical characters of iron, more especially when in the form of steel or slightly carbonized iron, have rendered this element one of special importance since the earliest ages for the fabrication of cutting instruments, weapons, and tools of various kinds. In the form of moderately-pure malleable or wrought iron, the metal is a substance possessed of considerable lustre and hardness, and of a bluish-white or bluish-grey colour; it takes a high polish, and when bright does not readily oxidize in dry air, although moist air, especially in presence of traces of acids, even of carbonic acid, readily effects its tarnishing and the subsequent formation of rust. It has a specific gravity near to 7 '75, and requires a very high temperature to effect its fusion, the melting point being the more elevated the purer the substance; its most valuable and characteristic property is its power of becoming soft and pasty before undergoing complete fusion, so that two hot masses may be pressed or squeezed together into one by the process of ιoelding, and so that by forging, rolling, hammering, or other analogous operations it can readily be fashioned into shapes which its rigidity and strength when cold enable it to maintain. Its strength and tenacity are very high, as also are its powers of being drawn into wire and rolled or hammered into sheets (ductility and malleability); these properties, however, are very largely influenced by the presence of impurities. In magnetic characters it is superior to all other substances, nickel and cobalt coming next to it in these respects, but being much lower in power; when it is almost pure, the magnetic influence produced, owing to induction, by the proximity of a permanent magnet or of an electric current disappears entirely on removal of the magnet or current; if, on the other hand, carbon be present (as is usually the case to some extent even in the softest malleable iron), there remains after removal of the magnet or current a greater or less amount of permanent magnetism according to circumstances, hard steel exhibiting the greatest power of becoming permanently magnetized under given conditions, and substances intermediate between pure iron and hard steel (soft steels and hard irons) possessing this power to a lesser extent. Other elements besides carbon, e.g., oxygen and sulphur, can communicate to iron the power of becoming permanently magnetized, as in the case of the minerals loadstone (magnetic oxide of iron) and magnetic pyrites. The effect of a magnet on iron at high temperatures is far below that exhibited at ordinary temperatures; according to Matteucci the action of a given magnet on a molten globule of iron is only 0 ’ 0015 per cent, of that on the same globule when cold, so that the attractive action is wholly insensible in the case of molten iron except when a powerful electromagnet is employed. In electrical conductivity and power of conducting heat (which are always approximately in the same ratio), iron stands about midway amongst metals; Matthiessen’s experiments give the specific resistance (C. G. S. system) of annealed iron as 9827 at 0° C., that of annealed silver being 1521 and that of mercury 96,190 at the same temperature. As with the other physical properties, the presence of small amounts of impurity largely affects the numerical value of the specific resistance, which is decreased some 35 per cent, by a rise in temperature from 0° to 100° C.

The specific heat of iron at the ordinary temperature is 0Ί1379 (Régnault), 0110 (Dulong and Petit). Pouillet gives the melting point when in a state of high purity as between 1500° and 1600° (probably somewhat too low), Scheerer as 2100°, Deville as near to that of platinum, which is not far from 1900°-2000°. The presence of minute quantities of carbon, sulphur, &c., sensibly lowers the fusing point, whilst 1 per cent, of the former furnishes a steel melting at several hundred degrees lower than pure iron (at near 1600°),—cast iron containing some 3 per cent, of carbon [9:13:279] melting at near 1500°, and being rendered still more fusible by the presence of small quantities of sulphur and silicon; whence sulphurized pig irons are often blended with purer varieties in order to produce good casting metal for various purposes. At the ordinary temperature the linear coefficient of expansion of wrought iron is near to 0Ό000125 (values between 0Ό000115 and 0Ό000144 having been obtained by Borda, Smeaton, Lavoisier and Laplace, Troughton, and Dulong and Petit), so that 1 unit of length at 0° will become on an average 1 , 00125 units in length at 100°. Slightly lower values have been obtained with steel of different qualities by various of these observers, averaging 0Ό000115; whilst cast iron expands less still, averaging 0 ’ 0000111 as linear coefficient of expansion; the precise numbers obtainable vary with the conditions, according as the metal has been hammered, rolled, hardened, annealed, <fcc. At somewhat elevated temperatures the rate of expansion is higher; thus Dulong and Petit find that the mean rate of expansion of iron between 0° and 100° is to that between 0° and 300° nearly in the ratio of 4 to 5. The force exerted during expansion is very great, being equal to that requisite to produce an elongation of the bar examined to the extent through which its length increases by heat; thus, according to Barlow, a weight of 1 ton suspended to an iron bar a square inch in section will extend its length by 0Ό001 times the original length, so that 1 inch of length will become 1∙0001 inches; this increase in length would be brought about by a rise in temperature of about 9° C.; hence for an increase of 36°, or less than the average difference between a cold and warm day in winter and summer respectively, a girder of iron of 20 square inches in section would exert a thrusting strain upon two walls, &c., built firmly up to its ends when coldest, equal to about 20 × 3 ∕ or 80 tons for each inch of its length, were it not that the pressure is more or less relieved by the giving of the walls long before this strain is reached. In consequence it is indispensable to allow a space for expansion in all constructions in which iron is employed, e.g., ordinary buildings, railways, furnaces braced together with tie-rods, &c.

With large masses of ironwork exposed to the weather, very great strains may be produced through unequal expansion in differently heated parts, e.g., in the portions exposed to sunshine and in the shade respectively; as just indicated, a difference of temperature of 9° between two portions rigidly connected will produce a strain of about 1 ton per square inch. Edwin Clark has calculated that half an hour’s sunshine produces more effect in the way of developing strain on the tubes of the Britannia bridge over the Menai Straits than the heaviest rolling loads or the most violent storms. Variations of temperature also exert some effect upon the strength and tenacity of iron; the numerical values are largely variable with the quality of the metal. At temperatures below a red heat the strength is considerably lessened, and at high temperatures approximating to the welding temperature the tenacity becomes comparatively small (see § 43).

A peculiar suspension of the chemical activity of iron in reference to nitric acid (passive condition) appears to be connected with its electrical relationships; when placed in nitric acid very slightly diluted (specific gravity about l - 4), iron is ordinarily violently attacked; but if whilst in the acid it be touched with certain substances, e.y., gold, platinum, plumbago, &c., the action stops (at least under certain conditions, especially when not heated above some particular temperature varying with the strength of the acid —Ordway); the iron thus rendered passive will induce the same condition in a second piece immersed in the acid by contact; on exposure to air the passive iron loses its power of remaining unattacked. Concentrated nitric acid, of specific gravity 1 - 45, produces the passive condition at once, so that a piece of bright metal may be kept for months immersed in the acid without any action being set up; acid of strength below specific gravity 1 '35, on the other hand, is usually incapable of permitting iron to become or remain passive in contact with it. If, whilst passive and immersed in nitric acid, iron be made the positive pole for a voltaic current sent through the acid, oxygen is evolved from its surface without any oxidation being visible; if on the other hand it be made the negative pole, it immediately loses its passivity, and is attacked by the acid. In consequence of the production of the passive state by contact with concentrated nitric acid, iron is sometimes substituted for carbon or for platinum in the forms of voltaic battery known as Bunsen’s and Grove’s cells. Passivity may also be brought about in iron by heating the bright metal in the flame of a spirit lamp, &c., so as to coat it superficially with a film of oxide.

Preparation of Pure Iron.— In order to prepare pure iron, special chemical operations must be gone through, of increasing complexity the greater the purity desired. Berzelius obtained a nearly pure fused substance by mixing filings of the purest soft iron of commerce obtainable with about 20 per cent, of pure ferric oxide and some glass powder (free from lead) as a flux, and exposing for an hour to the highest heat of a smith’s forge in a covered crucible; in this Λvay the small quantities of carbon and other impurities still retained by the filings are oxidized, and a button of silvery lustre results, of specific gravity 7 - 844, more tough but softer than ordinary iron. Matthiessen and Szczepanowski found the greatest difficulty in obtaining iron absolutely free from sulphur by means of the ordinary methods for preparing oxide of iron subsequently reduced by pure hydrogen, but ultimately succeeded in obtaining moderately large quantities of metal not containing more than ΟΌ0025 to 0 ’ 0007 per cent, of sulphur by the employment of a specially prepared ferric oxide made by heating together pure ferrous sulphate and sodium sulphate {Brit. Assoc. Reports, 1868, 1869), and thoroughly washing out the sodium sulphate from the fluxed product. After reduction in platinum vessels by pure hydrogen, and fusion in lime crucibles by the oxyhydrogen flame fed with purified gases, buttons of metal were obtained absolutely free from phosphorus, silicon, and calcium, and practically free from sulphur. By the electrolysis of as nearly as possible neutral solutions of ferrous chloride, or better of double magnesium ferrous sulphate, iron is thrown down in hard brittle films containing a considerable amount of occluded hydrogen (usually about twenty times its volume); on annealing, the metal becomes soft, malleable, and silvery white, increasing considerably in density, the specific gravity when first deposited, being about 7 ’ 67, and rising to 7’81 after annealing; Lenz finds that the amount of hydrogen occluded is greater the thinner the film of metal, the amount rising in the case of a very thin film to upwards of 180 volumes; the metal deprived of the occluded gas by heating in vacuo decomposes water at ordinary temperatures and rusts, partially reabsorbing hydrogen in so doing {Pegg. Aηηaleη, v. 242, 1870); whereas before the expulsion of the hydrogen by heating in vacuo the iron is highly brittle and of a fine granular texture, showing no crystalline structure under the microscope (being deposited from solutions containing no free acid), after the expulsion of the hydrogen the metal becomes highly tenacious and capable of resisting repeated bending backwards and forwards without rupture; the hardness is lowered from 5 5 to 4‘5 on the mineralogical scale, ie., from something between the hardness of felspar and apatite to something between that of apatite and fluorspar. Under certain conditions iron can be obtained in a crystallized state, the crystalline character being far more readily assumed when small quantities of other substances, notably carbon, are present; by reducing ferrous chloride by hydrogen at a red heat, Peligot obtained· the metal in brilliant crystals belonging to the cubic system; by reduction with zinc vapour Poumare<le transformed ferrous chloride into hollow tetrahedra of specific gravity 7’84. Bessemer iron has been obtained in distinct cubic crystals, whilst Percy has observed solid and skeleton octahedra in cast iron. Malleable iron that has been much rolled and forged during its manufacture exhibits on etching with acids a fibrous structure; when pulled asunder by a slowly acting force, this structure is also well seen; if, however, it be transversely ruptured by a suddenly applied force {e.g., the impact of a heavy shot on an armour plate), a crystalline fracture usually results. Iron exhibiting fibrous structure on etching is usually considerably more tough and tenacious than that which is crystalline. A change from the former kind of molecular structure to the latter, producing comparative brittleness, is believed by many to occur with crank-shafts, axles, &c., exposed to continuous vibration and jolting; in some cases the acquisition of a high degree of permanent magnetism {e.g., in pump rods) is said to have been observed as occurring just before rupture of the metal took place.

2. Chemical and Physical Relationships of Iron.— Don unites with oxygen in several proportions, forming definite oxides, the best marked of which are those indicated by the formulae FeO, Fe. 1 O 4 , and Fe ? O 3 , O standing for .16 parts of oxygen, and Fe for 56 of iron, the value 56 being [9:13:280] chosen rather than the older combining number 28 in accordance with Dulong and Petit’s law. Besides these, however, indications of the existence of a lower oxide Fe 2 O have been obtained by Lowthian Bell (Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting, p. 85); for by partially reducing the higher oxides by carbon oxide at temperatures near to 420° C., a mixture of metallic iron, unreduced oxide, and free carbon results, from which the iron can be dissolved out by digestion with water and iodine in closed vessels, after which the relationship between the undissolved iron and the oxygen present is very close to that indicated by the formula Fe 2 O. On the other hand, derivatives of an oxide higher than Fe 2 O 3 exist, compounds known as ferrates being formed by heating iron with nitre, and in other ways, the composition of which may be expressed by regarding them as containing iron trioxide united to other metallic oxides, eg., potassium ferrate, K 2 O, FeO 3 (just as potassium sulphate may be regarded as an analogous compound containing sulphur trioxide, K 2 O, SO 3 ). Neither the hypothetical ferric anhydride (or iron trioxide, FeO 3 ) nor any other oxide intermediate between it and Fe 2 O 3 has as yet been isolated, although iron disulphide, FeS 2 , is well known.

Of these oxides, two, viz., FeO and Fe 2 O 3 , correspond to stable well-defined classes of salts conveniently referred to as the ferrous and ferric salts respectively, 56 parts of iron replacing 2 parts of hydrogen in an acid to form the corresponding ferrous salt, and replacing 3 parts to form a ferric salt. The heat of formation of all oxides up to Fe 3 O 4 appears to be about uniform, viz., near to 66,000 gramme degrees per 16 grammes of oxygen combined; but that of the formation of Fe 2 O 3 is sensibly less, so that when the latter oxide is reduced the rate of reduction is much more rapid prior to the removal of one-ninth of the oxygen present and consequent formation of Fe 3 O 4 than it is subsequently, in accordance with the general law which appears to exist connecting the rate at which reduction goes on with the development of heat during the chemical change (Alder Wright and Rennie, Chem. Soc. Journal, 1880 [Transactions], p. 757). Probably it is in consequence of this that Fe 2 O 3 breaks up at an intense white heat into oxygen and Fe 3 O 4 , and that when iron is burnt in oxygen so that the temperature is very high Fe 3 O 4 is formed and not Fe 2 O 3 ; just as higher oxides of manganese than the corresponding Mn 3 O 4 break up on strong ignition into oxygen and Mn 3 O 4 . On the other hand, just as oxides of manganese lower than Mn 3 O 4 , and also that oxide itself, take up oxygen forming higher oxides on heating in the air to moderate temperatures, so Fe 3 O 4 can be oxidized to Fe 2 O 3 by direct addition of oxygen taken up in the s*ame way; it is noticeable, however, that, whilst Fe 3 O 4 , possessing a certain kind of physical structure, will thus oxidize to Fe 2 O 3 on being exposed to ordinary atmospheric influences, yet when other kinds of physical structure are possessed (producible by special modes of formation) its tendency to oxidize further even in moist city air becomes inappreciable.

It is remarkable that, whilst iron ores which mainly contain the oxide Fe 3 O 4 are highly magnetic in character (the loadstone being one variety of this class of minerals, and the generic names “magnetic iron ore” and “magnetic oxide of iron” being derived from this fact), the other iron compounds found in nature are far less marked in regard of their possession of this quality, one particular sulphide of iron excepted, termed magnetic pyrites in consequence, and indicated by the formula Fe 7 S 8 , or possibly Fe 8 S 8 . Thus the following values were found by Pliicker as the relative effects of equal volumes of soft iron, loadstone, specular iron ore, and brown haematite on a given magnet undeχ∙ similar conditions :—
[table]

Oxides of iron of all classes are readily acted upon by reducing agents (especially hydrogen, carbon, oxide, and free carbon and silicon) in such a fashion as to cause the transference of the oxygen of the oxide to the reducing agent, a lower oxide of iron and finally metallic iron being set free. In accordance with the general rules obtaining in such cases (Alder Wright and Bennie, loc. cit.), the rate of reduction of feme oxide of given physical character is less, caetcris paribus, when a reducing agent is employed which evolves less heat in uniting with oxygen than when one is used evolving more heat; so that a reduction by hydrogen with formation of water vapour goes on more slowly under constant conditions than reduction by carbon oxide forming carbon dioxide, whilst the temperature requisite to cause reduction to be brought about to a just measurable extent (temperature of initial action) is lower with carbon oxide than with hydrogen, and lower with hydrogen than with free carbon (Alder Wright and Luff, Chem. Soc. Journal, 1878 ^Transactions], pp. 1, 504). The precise rate of reduction and temperature of initial action observed in any given case vary with the conditions of the experiment and also with the physical character of the iron oxide (see also Lowthian Bell, Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting).

When ferric oxide is reduced by carbon oxide, a peculiar secondary change is brought about under certain conditions, which has been investigated by Lowthian Bell with the present writer’s cooperation (loc. cit.) ; this consists in the reaction of a lower oxide of iron (Fe 2 O ?) formed at a certain stage of the reduction on the carbon oxide forming a higher oxide of iron and setting free carbon;^[1. According to Grüner (Comptes Rendus, 1871, 28), the reaction is 3FeO + CO-FeO+C, some metallic iron being always formedin addition to the ferrous oxide produced by the subsequent reduction of the FeO, so that a ferruginous carbon always results. ] the higher oxide of iron is then again reduced by a fresh portion of carbon oxide, and so on in a cycle, so that after some time the quantity of free carbon deposited largely exceeds the total iron present. This peculiar action is also exhibited by oxides of nickel and cobalt, but apparently by those of no other metals; it has a most remarkable influence upon the nature of the chemical changes ensuing in the process of smelting iron by the blast furnace (§ 19), and is doubtless the chief source of the carbon contained in pig iron thus produced; it is also the main reaction taking place during the conversion of iron into steel by cementation (§ 32).

Ferrous carbonate differs from most of the other compounds of iron found in nature in being soluble in water, especially when excess of carbonic acid is also present, an “acid carbonate” being formed. Such water on exposure to air forms a rusty deposit of hydrated ferric oxide produced by the combination of the oxygen of the air with the ferrous oxide contained in the ferrous carbonate, the carbon dioxide originally combined therewith being set free. In certain localities large deposits of more or less pure hydrated ferric oxide are thus formed, constituting “bog iron ores.”

The sulphides of iron partly correspond to the oxides. Thus the sulphides Fe 2 S, FeS, and Fe 2 S 3 exist; besides these, the compound Fe 8 S has been described, whilst magnetic pyrites, Fe 7 S 8 (or Fe 8 S 9 ), and ordinary pyrites, FeS 2 , and its allotropic or metameric modification marcasite, constitute minerals of widespread occurrence, and of considerable value, mainly as sources of sulphur, secondarily on account of the iron they contain, and more especially with certain kinds of pyrites on account of the copper, silver, and gold sulphides intermixed therewith. It is to be noticed in connexion with pyrites that, by the action of reducing agents on solutions of iron compounds in presence of sulphates, a slow formation of crystalline FeS 2 often results; thus many fossil plants and animals occur in various strata in which the deposition of pyrites by this means has produced a perfect cast or pseudomorph, so to speak, of the organism; it is probable that the pyritous deposits of large magnitude which exist in various localities have been formed by these agencies, the soluble iron salt having been originally the carbonate.

The chlorides of iron correspond to the ferrous and ferric series of salts, i.e., are indicated by the formulae FeCl 2 and FeCl 8 (or preferably Fe 2 Cl 4 and Fe 2 Cl 6 ) respectively; chlorides corresponding to Fe 2 O, Fe 3 O 4 , FeS 2 , <tc., have not as yet been formed. The same remark applies to the salts of iron formed by the substitution of iron for hydrogen in all the acids of common occurrence. For the use of iron salts and other ferruginous compounds in the arts [9:13:281] generally see separate articles. Its therapeutic uses are noticed at p. 359.

3. Relationships between Iron {Malleable and Cast) and Steel.— Iron possesses the power of uniting with a number of elements, forming products which either are highly intimate mixtures of more than one substance presenting apparent homogeneity, or else are compounds of an indefinite character, i.e., in which the constituents are combined in proportions which do not come under the usual chemical laws of invariableness of composition and of combination in multiple proportions; in short, these iron compounds are substances belonging to the same category as alloys generally and solutions, the placing of which inside or outside the class of true chemical compounds depends on the particular definition of a chemical compound adopted. Probably the most accurate view of the constitution of such substances is that which regards them as being “solidified solutions” of one substance in another (Matthiessen), i.e., when the bodies in question have been fused: the most useful commercial forms of iron are of this class. Thus, for example, iron sulphide and metallic iron fused together in such proportions that the latter greatly predominates form a homogeneous mixture (or solution of irop sulphide in molten iron), which on cooling solidifies as a whole, not exhibiting any tendency to separation t>f the iron and iron sulphide; a product similar but melting more readily is formed if iron sulphide and sulphur be fused together, forming one of the varieties of the so-called “Spence’s metal” recently patented; so that between the extremes of pure iron on the one hand and pure sulphur on the other an apparently homogeneous mass can be obtained containing iron or sulphur in any assignable proportions, the compound being a solidified solution of iron sulphide in either iron or sulphur, according as the former or the latter is in excess. Silicon and phosphorus can be similarly incorporated with excess of iron, forming analogous solidified solutions; the same remark is true for nitrogen and other non-metallic elements, as well as for manganese and many other metals, notably nickel, gold, tin, platinum, rhodium, aluminium, zinc, titanium, tungsten, and chromium. With arsenic and tin definite compounds can be produced expressible by simple formulae, e.y., FeAs (Gehlen) and FeSn (Deville and Caron). When carbon is thus incorporated with iron a peculiar phenomenon is (under certain circumstances) observable which has no parallel with the other compounds, except perhaps to some extent in the case of silicon; this is that, whereas the carbon is in the amorphous condition when first dissolved, yet on long-continued maintenance in the molten state, but more especially on cooling (whilst the substance is still liquid or semisolid), a more or less complete separation of carbon in the crystallized graphitoidal state ^[2. Snelus has shown {Journal Iron and Steel Institute, 1871, i. 28) that it is practicable to remove mechanically from a highly crystalline pig iron graphitoidal scales, which consist so entirely of carbon as to leave little or no appreciable residue on combustion. ] often ensues; so that the cooled mass is no longer visibly homogeneous, but consists of granules and crystals, partly of graphite and partly of solidified solution of amorphous carbon (and such other elements as were originally present) in iron. This phenomenon may be compared with a somewhat analogous change undergone by phosphorus: when this element is dissolved in carbon disulphide or certain organic bodies, e.g., ethyl iodide, the phosphorus gradually changes more or less completely into the red variety, which, being insoluble in the menstruum, precipitates in flakes. The amount of carbon which changes during solidification from the amorphous into the graphitoidal variety depends largely on the nature and amount of the substances present along with it dissolved in the iron, and also on the absolute amount of carbon present and on the rate of cooling; it appears to be promoted by the presence of silicon, the greyest irons {cseteris paribus) being usually the richest in silicon. On remelting graphitoidal cast iron, the graphite is again dissolved, so that by rapidly chilling the fused mass “white” iron results. Under certain conditions silicon appears to extrude from highly silicious irons in cooling, but not in a difficultly oxidizable form, so that the outside of the pigs becomes covered with silica of a peculiar physical aspect (Lowthian Bell, Journal Iron and Steel Institute, 1871, i. 44); under other conditions several parts per cent of silicon can be permanently retained by the pig without extrusion on cooling, forming a peculiar metal known as “glazy iron,” bearing to the silicious pig from which silicon does separate much the same relations as highly carbonized white iron bears to grey pig.

When foreign substances are present in but small quantity (manganese excepted), and the amount of total carbon does not exceed 1 ’ 5 to 2Ό per cent, of the iron, little or no separation of graphitoidal carbon takes place, and the resultant product is tolerably homogeneous, and possesses the properties of steel more or less soft in proportion as the carbon percentage is minute or otherwise.

When the carbon amounts to some 2 ’ 5 or upwards per cent, of the iron, and especially when the fused substance is rapidly cooled, the metal often solidifies as an almost homogeneous mass, possessing somewhat different properties from those of good steel; it is then known as white cast iron (from its colour after fracture); under other conditions, especially when a longer time is allowed for solidification, a more or less complete separation of graphite and consequent production of a coarse-grained crystalline structure results, the product being then termed grey cast iron, which consequently stands to white cast iron in much the same relation as devitrified glass (Reaumur’s porcelain) to ordinary glass. When the amount of manganese present is relatively large (constituting several parts per cent, of the iron present), this separation of graphitoidal carbon takes place to but a small or even inappreciable extent; the cooled mass is homogeneous and highly crystalline, the fractured surface exhibiting great brilliancy, whence the term spiegeleisen applied to such substances. As a rule cast irons, whether white or grey, contain more than traces of impurities, such as sulphur, phosphorus, and silicon; but otherwise no absolute line of demarcation between malleable iron and steel on the one hand, and between steel and white iron on the other, can be drawn, based on the chemical composition; so that it cannot be said that a substance containing so much carbon is malleable iron, and so much more carbon steel, and so much more still cast iron; the definition is purely arbitrary; moreover, the physical qualities of a steel containing a given amount of carbon often differ much, according as the proportion of other substances present varies.

The ordinary practical test applied todistinguish iron from steel is the ascertaining whether the substance hardens on heating and quenching in cold water, becoming again softened on reheating and cooling slowly: a substance which does this may fairly be regarded as steel (possibly of very bad quality, but still steel), ιvhilst one which does not may be fairly regarded as a soft iron. With certain specimens it is difficult thus to classify the substances under either head satisfactorily, whilst such a classification would not be accepted by many who would define a steel as being either the product of the cementation of malleable iron or as a substance that has been fused during manufacture, and who consequently would not admit that a very hard puddled metal was steel, even though it did harden distinctly on heating and quenching in cold water.

Although it is impossible to draw a sharp line distinguishing[9:13:282] between malleable iron when hard and steel when soft, there is no difficulty in tabulating the essential differences between good malleable iron, well-marked steel, and cast iron. Thus the following table may be drawn up

The following recommendations as to the nomenclature of iron and steel were made by an international committee appointed at Philadelphia in the year 1876 by the American Institute of Mining Engineers, consisting of I. L. Bell, Dr H. Wedding, Professors Tiinner and Akermann, L. Griiner, A. L. Holley, and T. Egleston :—

1. That all malleable compounds of iron, with its ordinary ingredients, which are aggregated from pasty masses or from piles or from any form of iron not in a. fluid state, and which will not sensibly harden and temper, and which generally resemble what is called wrought iron, shall be called weld iron (German, Schιoeisseisen ; French, fer soudé).

2. That such compounds, when they will from any cause harden and temper, and rvhich resemble what is now called “puddled steel,” shall be called weld steel (German, Schιctissstahl ; French, acier soudé).

3. That all compounds of iron, with its ordinary ingredients, which have been cast from a fluid state into malleable masses, and which will not sensibly harden by being quenched with water while at a red heat, shall be called ingot iron (German, Flusseisen-, French, fer fondu). 4 . That all such compounds, when they shall from any cause so harden, shall be called ingot steel (German, Flussstahl-, French, acier fondu).

Siemens (Lecture to Chemical Society, Journal Chem. Soc., 1868, p. 284) lays down the aphorism that “no method of producing steel can be considered admissible at the present day which does not pass the metal through the condition of entire liquefaction, for it is only by fusion that foreign admixtures can be thoroughly separated, and that flaws and fissures can be avoided;” which appears to imply that no substance that has not been completely fused should be termed a true steel even though it be susceptible of hardening. Nine years later {Presidential Address to the Iron and Steel Institute, 1877), in discussing the above proposed definitions of the international committee, he remarks that practical difficulties would be introduced by these definitions; for instance, railway bars, which ordinarily contain from 0 ’ 2 to 0'6 per cent, of carbon, would sometimes be stamped as ingot iron and sometimes as ingot steel; and he further objects that, unless the precise temperature to which the metal is to be heated in order to harden it is specified, and also the cooling medium into which it is plunged, discrepancies will be introduced between the results of tests of the same metal by different experimenters, certain conditions of temperature and cooling material enabling particular classes of metal to take a slight temper, the·which substances would not be hardened by the use of lower temperatures or different cooling materials, e.g., oil in lieu of water or msreury.

In view of the difficulty experienced in defining precisely what is meant at the present day by the terms iron and steel, and the practical inconveniencesand litigation thereby brought about, it has been proposed by Sir Joseph Whitworth and others to disuse the terms “iron’’and “steel” as distinctive marks of quality, and instead to define the metal in terms of its tensile strength and ductility (percentage elongation before rapture). The following table illustrates such a “scale” of qualities, being one employed at Seraing^[3. Recently a slightly different classification of the Seraing steels (Société John Cockerill) has been adopted (Annales Industrielles, August, 1879), viz. [table] ] for “steels” prepared by fusion processes :—
[9:13:283]
[table]

A tensile strength of 1 kilogramme per square millimetre is about equal to 0 '63 tons per square inch, so that on this scale extra soft, soft and semihard, and hard steels have average tensile strengths of about 32, 39, and 55 tons per square inch respectively. Steels of the (a) class can be bent U" shape without breaking, and will generally allow the two ends of the U to be hammered together without fracture; steels of the (e) class break when the angle of bend reaches to 130°-140°; and the .other classes are intermediate between these limits.

Hackney has proposed a classification of iron and steel practically identical with this “Seraing scale”; the main objections to such scales are that, as even the softest completely fused metals are thus designated “steel,” the time-honoured definition of steel as being a substance that can be hardened and tempered is wholly done away with; and the circumstance that the numerical values expressing the ductility and tensile strength are variable with the dimensions of the piece of metal tested (§ 43). Much confusion and litigation would be avoided were some name other than ‘ ‘ steel” applied to the modern metals of low carbon percentage obtained by fusion processes, and destitute of the power of taking any considerable amount of temper by heating red hot and rapidly cooling.

In practically testing a sample of steel, the difference between a specimen that has been prepared by a fusion process and by a process of puddling is usually very manifest when the specimens are slightly etched by dilute nitric acid or other agent that will gradually attack the metal: the fusion product exhibits a regular more or less granular structure, whilst the other exhibits more or less of a fibroid character. On dissolving the metal in cupric chloride (§ 6), a small amount of silicious cinder is left undissolved in the latter case, but practically none with a properly fused steel.

The presence of sulphur and phosphorus in true steels in other than the most minute proportions exercises a marked deteriorating effect upon the strength and tenacity of the metal, the former substance rendering the steel more or less brittle when hot (red-short or hot-short), the latter causing it to be liable to crack and break when cold (cold-short). The presence of manganese, however, and to some extent of carbon and silicon, modifies the exact amount of effect produced by a given quantity of phosphorus or sulphur; as a general rule it may be said that a steel containing 0 ’ 5 per cent, of carbon and upwards, and also containing more than 04 per cent, of sulphur, will be objectionably red-short, and that, if it contain more than 04 per cent, of phosphorus, it will be too cold-short for most applications; whilst a much smaller quantity, as little as 0Ό3 per cent., renders the steel almost useless for tools and cutting instruments, &c., in which a fine temper is essential. These figures, however, are subject to notable corrections: the presence of manganese to an extent of several times the amount of sulphur present considerably mitigates the evil effect of that substance, whilst, provided the carbon be very low (i.e. t that the metal is really not steel at all but only fused iron), much larger quantities of phosphorus than 04 per cent, may be present without deteriorating the properties of the substance to so great an extent as would be occasioned by the presence of much smaller quantities of phosphorus simultaneously with several tenths per cent, of carbon. Thus years ago the practical experience acquired at the Terre Noire works proved that good rails could be made from steel containing about 1 per cent, of manganese and as much as 0 ’ 3 per cent, of phosphorus, provided the carbon did not exceed half that amount; subsequently, good serviceable rails have been rolled not only in England but also in Saxony, Austria, America, and elsewhere, containing 0 , 3 to nearly 0 ’ 4 per cent, of phosphorus and about half as much of carbon, or less. These “phosphoric steels” (more correctly “homogeneous irons,” fused irons, or “ingot irons ”), however, are wholly unsuitable for all purposes requiring the metal to be tempered, on account of the impossibility of having so much phosphorus present together with more than minute amounts of carbon without producing brittleness and utter inability to be worked.

The effect of silicon on the physical qualities of steel is far less marked than that of sulphur and phosphorus. Like that of the latter it is modified by the amount of carbon present: thus Riley has found 2 per cent, of silicon in rails of good quality; Gautier states that a siliconeisen containing upwards of 7 per cent, of silicon, but almost destitute of carbon, could be forged perfectly, whilst a steel containing 1 ’ 5 per cent, of silicon and slightly less than 0 ’ 2 per cent, of carbon (with O ’ 76 of manganese) rolled perfectly and was very strong. The presence of silicon, moreover, conjointly with that of manganese, exerts a remarkable action in diminishing the extrusion of gases from molten steel in the act of solidifying, thereby producing honeycombing; so that when very soft steels are cast into ingots much sounder masses are obtained by the ordinary casting processes (i.e., not under hydraulic or other powerful pressure) when a little siliciuretted metal is added to the steel just before casting than when ordinary rich spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese is employed. On the other hand, when carbon and silicon are simultaneously present to the extent of 0 - 5 to 1Ό per cent, or thereabouts, both hot and cold shortness are brought about to a greater or lesser extent.

Nitrogen has been supposed by many chemists and especially by Fremy to be an essential constituent of steel; and in favour of this view it is to be noticed that in the preparation of steel by cementation the addition of nitrogenous organic matter (scraps of leather, horn, ferrocyanide of potassium, &c.) is found to facilitate the conversion of bar iron into blister steel. On the other hand this may be due simply to the formation and absorption of cyanogen, which carbonizes the iron without necessarily communicating nitrogen to it. The actual quantity of nitrogen found in steel by various experimenters is always extremely small,^[4. From 0Ό11 to 0T8 per cent, of nitrogen was found by Bonis in various specimens of malleable iron, cast iron, and steel; from 0 Ό07 . to 0 '057 per cent, in various steels and wrought irons was found by Boussiugault. By heating metallic iron in ammonia gas much more highly nitrogenized substances can be produced, Fremy having thus obtained substances containing as much as 9 - 8 per cent, of nitrogen. In these and other analogous experiments by others, various methods of analysis were adopted, the most conclusive ones being solution of the metal in pure hydrochloric acid, and determination ot the ammonia freed by the combination of the nascent hydrogen with the nitrogen. Recently A. H. Allen has repeated these experiments, and also made others by passing steam over the red-hot metal, and determining the ammonia produced. The quantity of nitrogen thus obtainable varied from 0’0041 per cent, in spiegeleisen to 0 ’ 0172 per cent, in steel made from Dannemora iron. ] whilst it is possible to produce steel from iron free from nitrogen by cementation in pure carbon oxide, or in an atmosphere of coal gas (Macintosh’s patent),—so that nitrogen is clearly not an essential constituent in these cases. Moreover, nitrogen has been found both in wrought and in cast iron in even larger quantity than in steel, so that the peculiar properties of steel as regards hardening [9:13:284] and tempering cannot be markedly influenced by the presence of this constituent. No connexion between the amount of nitrogen present and the physical properties of the metal, or the amount of carbon or other foreign elements present therein, has as yet been thus established by any experimenter.

As regards the presence of oxygen in iron and steel, and its effect on their qualities, little evidence as yet exists. It is well known that certain metals, e.g., copper, will dissolve small proportions of oxide, the presence of which renders the metal much less tenacious than it otherwise would be, so that certain operations are usually gone through in the final stages of the extraction of these metals for the purpose of again reducing the oxide disseminated through the mass, e.g., “poling” melted copper. The tenacity exhibited by “phosphor-bronze” is largely due to the complete reduction of copper and tin oxides by the phosphorus. This solution of oxide in the metal also takes place with iron, especially when tolerably free from silicon; this element is capable of reducing iron oxide when heated therewith, so that when present the silicon is oxidized in preference to the iron.

Overblown Bessemer metal is comparatively unforgeable and brittle, so that probably the presence of oxygen affects iron in the same way as sulphur. When iron and steel are overheated for a long time, they become “burnt” and brittle; this is supposed by some to be due to the formation of oxide disseminated through the mass of the metal, but many others consider that a more or less crystalline structure set up under the influence of a softening heat is the sole cause of the diminution in strength and tenacity <§ 43).

Iron and steel usually give off, on heating under diminished pressure, carbon oxide and more or less hydrogen, and the former gas is largely extruded from steel in the act of solidifying (Bessemer), thereby giving rise to honeycombing of the casting. This is usually attributed to the same cause as the “spitting” of silver, i.e., to a physical inability on the part of the metal to retain in solution at a lower temperature the same amount of gas that it can dissolve when more highly heated; the presence or silicon diminishes this evolution of gas, probably by the decomposition of the carbon oxide with formation of non-gaseous silica. A number of observations and determinations of the gases occluded by and otherwise present in iron and steel have been made by Parry, Troost and Hautefeuille, Miiller, and others, but without leading to any definite correlations between the physical properties of the metals and the gases occluded. Moreover, it does not seem to be absolutely established whether the carbon oxide obtained by heating in an exhausted tube really exists as dissolved gas or as a mixture of oxide and carbide (or solution of carbon); the writer has found that by varying the mode of heating and the temperature variable proportions of carbon oxide and dioxide may be obtained from spongy iron (prepared by heating to a bright red heat ferric oxide in an atmosphere of carbon oxide) when it is heated in connexion with a Sprengel pump; which seems to suggest that a mixture of oxide and carbide is present rather than simply occluded gases.

Hydrogen when present in iron to a considerable extent appears very considerably to diminish the tenacity and strength; thus electro-deposited iron containing much hydrogen is brittle, but becomes soft and flexible on heating under diminished pressure so as to extract the hydrogen. When iron or steel wires are immersed in dilute sulphuric acid, especially in contact with zinc, so as to evolve hydrogen copiously from the surface of the iron, the wires take up about twenty times their volume of hydrogen, and become so brittle that they break on attempting to bend them.

Copper is often present in minute quantity in pig iron. When steel contains a few tenths per cent, of copper it is distinctly red-short, more so when the proportion is increased (Eggertz). Malleable iron does not seem to be so much affected by copper, 0 ’ 5 per cent, giving but little red-shortness; the welding power is, however, considerably diminished. On the other hand, addition of iron to bronze and similar copper alloys increases their strength and tenacity, as in Aich’s gun-metal and Gedge’s metal. Antimony acts as injuriously upon iron as sulphur and phosphorus conjointly, a few tenths per cent rendering bar iron highly cold-short and also hot-short. Chromium, tungsten, vanadium, and titanium are all apparently capable of increasing the strength of iron more or less after the fashion of carbon, and accordingly have been regarded as valuable constituents in special kinds of iron and steel, e.g., the so-called chromium steel and tungsten steel, and the iron containing traces of vanadium employed on the Swiss wire bridges at Freiburg. Faraday and Stodart found that about 1 per cent, of platinum or certain of its congeners (e.g., palladium and rhodium) improved the toughness of steel, and communicated to it a fine grain. Hickel is largely present in meteoric iron (vide infra), from which knife blades, &c., are readily beaten out, so that the presence of nickel does not appear to diminish materially the malleability of iron.

The question as to whether the carbon which does not separate in the graphitoidal state on cooling molten cast iron or steel is truly combined or not (in the sense in which oxygen is combined in ferric oxide, and not in the sense in which silicate of cobalt may be said to be combined in blue glass to which it gives the colour, or in which sugar is combined with water in syrup) is one about which great divergence of opinion exists. It is usual to speak of this carbon as “combined carbon,” because when the iron or steel is dissolved in an acid (e. g. , hydrochloric acid), this carbon combines with the evolved hydrogen and escapes as carburetted hydrogen of some kind, whereas the graphitoidal carbon remains behind unaffected; just in the same way the sulphur escapes as sulphuretted hydrogen. It is by no means apparent, however, that carbon if set free in the amorphous condition in a state of excessively fine division and in presence of nascent hydrogen would not forthwith combine with the hydrogen, even though its condition in the iron were only that of a dissolved body; the probability is indeed rather the other way, for such carbon when free and warm is known to be often pyrophoric in the air, whilst the mixture of carbon and partially reduced iron and iron oxide, formed when carbon oxide is allowed to act on feme oxide for some time at a low red heat, evolves hydrogen containing much carburetted hydrogen on treatment with an acid, e.g., hydrochloric acid. It is to be remembered also that, whilst definite sulphides of iron are known and are easily obtainable, the same can hardly be said of carbides of iron; it is true that spiegeleisen (manganeseiron alloy) contains a larger amount of so-called combined carbon than ordinary steel, amounts up to 6 per cent, having been found therein; but it hardly follows from this that spiegeleisen and steel, &c., contain a definite carbide, such as Fe 4 C, or Fe 8 C, which has sometimes been considered as present therein, e.g., by Karsten, Gurlt, Mattieu Williams, and others. A compound the constituents of which separate on cooling would be a very unusual sort of substance, whereas it is well established that by fusing and very rapidly chilling certain kinds of grey cast iron they are more or less converted into white or mottled iron, the amount of “combined” carbon largely increasing, and that of graphite correspondingly decreasing; whilst the converse change can be brought about in some kinds of white iron by fusing and very slowly cooling them, a notable separation of graphite and diminution in the quantity of “combined” carbon present being thus brought about. According to Âkermann fusion is not indispensable, long continued maintenance at a yellow heat sufficing to change white iron into grey.

In practice the quality of pig iron is to a considerable extent decided by the degree of crystallinity exhibited by it, i.e., by the extent to which graphite has separated out during solidification, and the size of the crystals of this substance and of the solidified partly decarbonized pig iron, the crystallization of which is promoted by the particles of graphite acting as nuclei. Pigs with the largest crystals are known as No. 1; those made up of somewhat smaller but still moderately large crystals, as No. 2; smaller-grained pigs, but still crystalline and grey, arc known as Nos. 3 and 4. The finest grained No. 4 pigs, being usually unsuitable for making castings, and only serviceable for the puddling forge, are designated ‘ ‘ forge 4,” the higher kinds being known generically as “foundry iron.” Sometimes a pig will solidify partly as white iron partly as grey, the crystallization having commenced in patches, but not having spread throughout the whole mass before it solidified; such iron is known as “mottled pig.” The price of market pig iron is regulated by these numbers and the locality of the furnace, i.e., the nature of the ore from which it is smelted; those brands which are specially free from phosphorus, and are consequently applicable to the preparation of “Bessemer metal” (steel made by the Bessemer-Mushet process—§ 36), are usually designated “Bessemer pig.” Special qualities of white iron free from sulphur and phosphorus and containing several parts per cent, of manganese smelted from spathose and other highly manganiferous ores are known as spiegeleisen, from their mirror-like fracture. Ferro-mαngαnese is a similar product containing a much larger amount of manganese (§ 41).

II. Natural Sources of Iron.

4. Meteoric Iron.— Metallic iron in a more or less pure condition is occasionally met with in nature, but the supply of metal from this source is wholly inconsiderable. Probably nearly all such substances are of meteoric origin, with the exception of ferruginous metallic platinum. Certain masses of oxidized iron with unoxidized metal in the interior have been found in Saxony and elsewhere; but great doubt exists as to whether these substances are not artificially prepared metal which has rusted exteriorly in the course of time. Near Nery (France), at a spot where a seam of coal had been burning for some time, Mossier found a mass of a very hard steely iron weighing upwards of 16 lb, together with smaller lumps, evidently formed by the reducing action of the burning coal on ferruginous matter in the soil and rock. True meteoric iron usually if not invariably contains nickel to the extent of from 1 or 2 parts per 100 of iron (as in meteorites analysed by Prout) up to considerably larger amounts. The following analyses of various specimens of meteoric iron consisting wholly or almost entirely of unoxidized substances may be taken as representing the general composition of the substance :—
[table]

Many meteorites consist of nickeliferous iron intermixed with larger or smaller amounts of oxidized minerals, in particular olivine, augite, labradorite, and other silicates, together with chrome ironstone, magnetic pyrites, magnetic oxide of iron, and schreibersite (phosphide of nickel and iron), &c. On solution in acids many of these substances are left undissolved, especially schreibersite; in consequence meteorites of mainly metallic character often exhibit peculiar crystalline figures (something like the “moirée metallique” produced by pouring acids on tinplate) when etched by acids (Wiedmanstadt’s figures). Nordenskjöld has recently shown that many meteorites that have fallen at different times exhibit great uniformity in composition, so that it is highly probable that they all had a common extra-terrestrial origin. Graham found (Proceedings of Royal Society, xv. 502, 1867) that the Lenarto iron yielded on heating in vacuo 2'85 times its volume of gas, containing
[table]

whilst ordinary malleable iron (horse-shoe nails) yielded a rather smaller amount of gas, of which carbon oxide and dioxide constituted the majority; from the fact that he was unable to impregnate ordinary metallic malleable iron with more than about its own volume of hydrogen, whilst this meteoric metal contained upwards of two and a half times its volume of that gas, Graham concluded that the meteorite was derived from a cosmical body possessing a dense atmosphere of hydrogen, such as spectrum analysis indicates as ex» isting in various fixed stars, of which α Lyrae may be taken as a type.

5. Ores of Iron.— Cutting instruments of a rough character have been fashioned by savage and semi-savage nations from meteoric iron; but the sources from which the metal is practically extracted are those ores in which the metallic properties of the element are masked by its combination with non-metallic substances. These ores are essentially divisible into three classes, viz., those respectively in which the iron exists as sulphide, as carbonate, and as oxide. The first class of ore is best exemplified by pyrites or iron disulphide, FeS 2 ; comparatively little iron is directly pro duced from ores of this class, although the impure ferric oxide obtained from the residue left in the vitriol works after combustion of pyrites and extraction of copper from the residue, known as “purple ore” or “blue billy,” is utilized as “fettling” in the puddling operation, and has sometimes been employed on the spot where it is produced as a source of finely divided metallic iron for the precipitation of the more valuable copper, the reduction being simply effected by heating together the iron oxide and small coal, or by passing over the heated oxide reducing gases prepared by the partial combustion of coal or other fuel, &c. It may be noticed in passing that the ferrum redactum of pharmacy, or spongy metallic iron, is produced in much the same way, purer materials being employed, ordinarily a pure ferric oxide or hydrated ferric oxide and hydrogen gas; and that several methods for the reduction of iron on a manufacturing scale from various ores based on the same principle have been attempted hitherto without much commercial success (§ 30). The ores in which iron exists as carbonate, FeCO 3 , are essentially of two kinds, viz., those in which the ferrous carbonate is crystalline and but little admixed with earthy matters, and those in which a larger or smaller amount of clayey matter is intimately intermixed with the ferruginous compound: the former class is generally termed spathic iron ore (sparry ore, siderite, spathose), and often contains a notable amount of magnesium or of manganese carbonate; the latter class is from its texture and appearance generally spoken of as clay ironstone or argillaceous iron ore. Large deposits of a variety of clay ironstone exist in the Coal Measures, frequently alternating with layers of carbonaceous matter, whence the term blackband is applied to this variety. In many cases deposits of spathose and of clay ironstone have become more or less altered by the action of air and moisture, the effect of which is to convert ferrous carbonate into ferric oxide; in other instances by the action of heat derived from the underlying strata by conduction, or due to trap dykes and analogous volcanic agency, the ferrous carbonate is more or less completely converted into an iron oxide akin to magnetic oxide,—so that the deposits of spathose ore or clay ironstone shade off in places into deposits of the iron oxide class.

The third class of iron ores in which the iron exists as oxide may be divided into three subclasses, viz., those in which the iron respectively exists as anhydrous ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 , as hydrated ferric oxide, Fe 2 O 3 ,H 2 O, or other hydrate, and as ferrous and ferric oxides combined, of which magnetic oxide of iron Fe 3 O 4 is the type. To the first division belong the red haematite and specular ores, to the second brown haematite and bog iron ore, and to the third the magnetic iron ore properly so called, or loadstone, and various modifications of this found in different localities, and usually also designated as magnetic ore, although frequently not possessed of strongly marked magnetic properties, and also the ironsands of India, New Zealand, St Lawrence, and elsewhere. These latter are usually almost pure Fe 3 O 4 , intermixed with more or less silicious matter (often titaniferous), and are distinguished by their remarkable freedom from tendency to take up oxygen and pass into the state of ferric oxide, the which property is not by any means possessed to an equal extent by all so-called magnetic ores; just as deposits of ferrous carbonate by the action of heat, air, and moisture become changed, so beds of ore exhibiting in the main a composition akin to that of magnetic oxide of iron often contain portions which have become converted by similar agencies into ores more resembling red or brown haematite. Owing also to the variable intermixture of gangue of various kinds with the veins of iron ore, the physical properties of the substances become more or less altered, so that it is often difficult to [9:13:286] classify a particular ore otherwise than in broad general terms.

According to the nature and amount of the admixed substances, the value of the ore varies largely. The presence of certain impurities, notably of phosphorus, in more than minute quantity prevents the use of certain ores for particular purposes, and thus reduces their value; the admixture of particular kinds of gangue in other cases renders the ores unsuitable for working in the same kind of way that would otherwise be advantageous; in smelting such ores by means of a blast furnace different kinds and amounts of flux for the earthy impurities are requisite in different cases, thus affecting the cost of production, —so that in fine the value of an ore is by no means necessarily proportionate to the amount of actual iron present therein. The following table gives a rough idea of the general composition and characters of the leading classes of iron ores, such as are in actual use as sources of metal :—
[table]

Red haematite ores (including specular ore or fer oligiste and micaceous ore) vary considerably in their external appearance; the variety known as ‘ ‘ kidney ore” is well exemplified by the Cumberland deposits, and constitutes dark brownish-red botryoidal and reniform concretions, occasionally with a considerable amount of smoothness and lustre externally, and of crystalline frequently radiating structure; softer varieties are known as “red ochre” and “puddlers’ ore,” owing to their use for “fettling” puddling furnaces and’as pigments, and are of unctuous consistency almost earthy in character. ‘ ’ Specular ore” is a hard well-crystallized form, deriving its name from the brightness of the surface of its crystals, which appear dark grey or black by reflected light; this variety is well exemplified by the Elba ore; its specific gravity is near 5 ‘0, the crystalline, system being the hexagonal. “Titaniferous iron ore” or “ilmenite” resembles specular ore in appearance and crystalline form; it is more strictly a variety of magnetic ore, however, inasmuch as it usually contains a considerable amount of ferrous oxide; the ferrous titanate present may on the other hand be regarded as FeTiO 3 , or Fe i O 3 , in which half of the iron is replaced by titanium; whilst some of the ferrous iron is frequently replaced by magnesium. “Micaceous iron ore” is a crystalline scaly substance which, when of sufficient brilliancy, forms a good pigment for ironwork, known as ‘ ‘ minium de fer.” Asa rule haematites are considerably free from phosphorus and sulphur; various haematitic deposits in Spain, however, have been found by the writer and others to contain large amounts of phosphorus, sometimes to the extent of several parts per cent, of that element in relation to the iron; whilst occasionally pyrites veins are found in haematite beds. The chief haematitic ores worked are those from Cumberland and North Lancashire (Ulversion, Furness, Whitehaven, &c.); from Sweden and Norway (Dalkarlsberg, Uto, &c.); from Liege, Saxony, the Harz, Silesia, and Austria; from Elba and Brazil (specular ore); and from Missouri (Iron Mountain, Pilot Knob), Lake Superior, Ohio, Tennessee, and Alabama; many other deposits, however, exist, this class of ore being very widely spread; thus it is found in some quantity in Cornwall (Restormel), Brixham, Ayrshire, Glamorganshire, North Wales, the Isle of Man, the Erzgebirge, Russia, Spain, &c. Haematitic ores are usually found in the older geological formations, especially the Huronian, Cambrian, Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous rocks; in many cases they are distinctly of sedimentary character, i.e., they have obviously been deposited by aqueous agency. Some deposits have probably been originally thrown down either as ferric oxide detritus from the abrasion of rocks, &c., containing ferruginous matter, or as hydrated oxide from the oxidation of water containing ferrous carbonate in solution, the ochreous deposits thus formed having been rendered more or less completely anhydrous and indurated by the long-continued effect of pressure and the conduction of the internal heat of the earth to them. The Cumberland haematite largely occurs in pockets in Carboniferous Limestone, and has doubtless been produced by the latter kind of agency, the cavities of the limestone rock becoming gradually filled up by the deposition of iron oxide. Red sandstones, on the other hand, represent deposits of ferric oxide thrown down simultaneously with much sand; whilst the earthy varieties of haematite have probably been less indurated by heat and pressure, and were doubtless formed by deposition from water containing clayey matters in suspension to a greater or lesser extent. The Alabama deposits exhibit distinct stratification, forming a bed between the Coal Measures and the Devonian Limestone upwards of 100 feet in thickness, and several square miles in extent. In Cornwall, North Wales, and especially in the Lake Superior and Missouri districts, the haematitic deposits form large veins and lodes. The specular ores of Elba, Sweden, Missouri, and elsewhere usually occur as massive deposits; portions of the latter occasionally show the passage of spathose ore into specular ore (Snelus), suggesting the effect of heat accompanied by oxidizing action. Occasionally brown haematite is found passing into red, indicating gradual dehydration more complete in one portion of the deposit than in another. The following analyses illustrate the composition of some haematites :—
[table]

Brown haematite (including göthite, limonite, bog iron ore, lake ore, &c. ) varies even more in appearance and character than red haematite, and is found of the most varied degrees of purity. Many deposits have been apparently formed by the alteration of argillaceous ferrous carbonate; others form superficial sandy beds produced by the deposition of ochreous matters from solution either by purely chemical action, such as the oxidation of dissolved ferrous carbonate, or by the action of organized beings, especially Diatomaceae. 4- s a ru lθ much earthy matters are contained in this class of ores, together with considerable amounts of sulphur and phosphorus; certain deposits found in Spain and Africa (Bilbao and Marbella ores, &c.) are, however, often considerably free from these objectionable ingredients. Usually brown haematites are distinctly of sedimentary character, forming beds; but they often occur also as veins, especially in the older formations, doubtless deposited (often along with other minerals, e.g., copper ores) from water flowing through the cracks and crevices of the rocks. Sometimes the brown colour is much lightened, the tint being almost red and sometimes even yellow. In texture these ores usually differ considerably from the more compact kinds of red haematite, being cindery, earthy, or sandy in character, and only comparatively rarely massive, save when they have been subjected to indurating and compressing influences since their deposition, in which case they have usually lost water and become partially converted into something more like red haematite. Sometimes a definitely crystallized hydrate, Fe 2 O 3 , H 2 O (göthite), is found; scaly minerals of the same composition have also been described under the names of lepidocrocite, &c. The larger deposits of brown haematite are found in the Secondary and [9:13:287] more recent formations as a rule, but some considerable ones occur among the Coal Measures and Carboniferous Limestone; the Oolite, Lias, Jurassic, Greensand, and Wealden formations of England especially Northamptonshire and adjacent counties), and of France ( Boulogne and the Ardèche), Luxembourg, Bavaria, and Wurtemberg, contain deposits often of considerable magnitude and extent, which occasionally show distinct passage into reel haematite, and often passage of clay ironstone into brown haematite. Bog and lake ores are considered by Ehrenberg to be mostly formed by infusorial agency; on the dredging up of deposits of this kind (occurring in nodules and granular concretions), a new formation of lumps is often found to occur after the lapse of some years. In some cases these deposits are of large magnitude, e.g., those of Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Three Rivers (Canada). Pisolitic concretionary masses of a variety of brown haematite are found sometimes in large quantity in the German Oolites, and elsewhere in the cavities and crevices of limestones; these have been probably formed by deposition from water percolating through the rock, and the aggregation together of the ferric oxide thus thrown down, and the earthy matters also in suspension. The following table gives the composition of various kinds of ores belonging to the brown haematite class :—
[table]

Magnetic Iron Gres.— The substances most nearly approaching to the composition Fe3O 4 sometimes occur well-crystallized in forms belonging to the cubic system, and possessing a semi-metallic lustre; in the mineral franklinite (found in large quantities in New Jersey) the ferrous oxide present is largely replaced by zinc and manganese oxides without altering the crystalline shape (usually octahedral). The purest magnetites are strongly magnetic, and often show polarity, then constituting loadstone·, they differ from haematites in the colour of the streak, magnetic ore yielding a black, red haematite and specular iron a red, and brown haematite a brown streak; the specific gravity is about the same as that of compact red haematite, viz., near to 5'0, while brown haematites are usually considerably less dense, their specific gravity being near to 4 '2. Massive deposits are found in the older formations in Sweden and Norway (crystalline limestones, talcose schists, and diorites), North America (Laurentian series), the Ural mountains (doleritic porphyry), and Mexico (Cerro Mercado—felspathic porphyry); whilst considerable amounts are also found in somewhat more recent formations, e.g., in Piedmont (Traversella—talcose schists and dolomites), Spain, northern India, and Saxony (Berggieshiibel); in England only comparatively small quantities are found, notably at Rosedale (Yorkshire) and Brent and Dartmoor (Devonshire). The mines of Dannemora (southern Sweden) and Gellivara (Swedish Lapland) are of great antiquity, the iron produced from the ore thence raised being of the finest quality (partly owing to the use of charcoal in smelting); the Indian mines have also been a source of wootz for some two thousand years at least, whilst the Traversella deposits have been worked from time immemorial. Notable amounts of magnetic ore also occur in various parts of France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, North Africa, Greece, Australia, and Brazil; whilst in New Zealand (Taranaki), as also in the Bay of Naples, and especially along the north-east coast of British America and Labrador, enormous quantities of “iron sand” occur along the beach, derived from the disintegration of rocks containing crystalline magnetic oxide of iron (usually more or less titaniferous); this variety of magnetic oxide is capable of resisting indefinitely the oxidizing effect of air and water, and from its hardness and density becomes mechanically separated from the felspathic and silicious particles of matrix simultaneously formed during the erosion of the rocks; owing to its great freedom from sulphur and phosphorus, it is practicable to obtain from it (by the aid of charcoal) the finest qualities of iron. It has been supposed by some that the presence of titanium in the ore communicates special qualities to the steel thence prepared; but evidence in proof of this is requisite, inasmuch as it seems that the titanium present in the pig iron smelted from titaniferous ores, to the extent of some tenths per cent, or more, becomes eliminated during the transformation into malleable iron and steel just as silicon is similarly oxidized and removed. The following analyses illustrate the composition of various kinds of magnetic ore :—
[table]

Spathose Iron Ores.— Ferrous carbonate, being isomorphous with magnesium, manganese, and calcium carbonates, frequently occurs crystallized either by itself as siderite or with large intermixture of one or the other of these salts; when manganese is present to any considerable extent, the ores are more especially suitable for the production of spiegeleisen and ferro-manganese, especially when they contain little or no phosphorus. In Great Britain the chief deposits are those of Weardale (Carboniferous Limestone), Alston Moor (Cumberland), Brendon hills (Somerset), and Exmoor (Devonshire); these frequently show passage of the mineral into brown haematite by oxidation through access of air and moisture. Large massive deposits are found in Germany (Stahlberg near Müsen, Westphalia), Styria (Eisenerz), Thuringia, and Carinthia, mostly in rocks of the Devonian period or thereabouts, and sometimes constituting almost entire mountains; also in the Basque provinces, the Pyrenees, South Spain, and Nova Scotia. These ores are as a rule extremely free from phosphorus and sulphur, whence they are largely employed for the manufacture of malleable iron, steel, and spiegeleisen of high qualities; they are of notably less density than compact haematite or magnetite, usually possessing a specific gravity of near 3 - 8. The following analyses represent the composition of certain kinds of spathose ore :—
[table]

Clay Ironstone.— When ferrous carbonate occurs largely mixed with clayey matter, the crystalline structure is usually non-apparent; frequently so much calcium carbonate is also present as to make the ores useless for smelting purposes except when intermixed with others, the calcareous matter then serving as flux; nodules of this poor or· “lean” ironstone found in the London clay and elsewdιere are, however, largely used in the manufacture of cements, and hence are often known as cement stones. The largest deposits of clay ironstone are found in the Coal Measures, and often exhibit distinct stratification, fossils being not unfrequently met with, especially in the nodular varieties; blackband ores (layers of ironstone and clay alternating with coaly matter) are largely found in Staffordshire, Wales, and Scotland, and to some extent in the Rhenish and Westphalian[9:13:288] coalfields and in Ohio. When carbonaceous matter is not present in any considerable quantity, clay ironstone forms a dark bluish-grey or greyish-yellow mass, sometimes forming layers of nodules, sometimes distinctly bedded deposits of large area, e.g., the Cleveland beds of North Yorkshire, the ores of Glamorganshire, Shropshire, Derbyshire, France, Westphalia, and various parts of the United States, notably Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. Curiously, although an ordinary concomitant of coalfields, clay ironstone is almost entirely absent from the Coal Measures of Durham and Northumberland. In many localities clay ironstone has become so changed by oxidizing and hydrating influences as to contain but little ferrous carbonate, the iron being converted into a hydrate, giving to the ore the character of a brown haematite; this is specially noticeable in the Northamptonshire deposits, most of which are usually classed as brown haematite, although containing some amount of carbonate, whilst occasionally ferrous carbonate is found in them having undergone but little alteration, and forming a clay ironstone closely resembling that of Cleveland. As a rule Coal-Measure ironstones are somewhat highly phosphorized; this is especially noticeable with the Cleveland ore, which usually yields on smelting a pig iron containing between 1 and 2 parts of phosphorus per 100 of iron. The following table illustrates the composition of some of the more important clay ironstone deposits :—
[table]

Pyrites. — As already stated, pyrites is never used directly by the smelter as a source of iron; but the residue left after burning pyrites to make vitriol and extracting copper from the residue by Henderson’s process consists almost entirely of ferric oxide, and from its physical characters is valuable as fettling for puddling furnaces; so that the iron contained in the pyrites ultimately becomes largely reduced to the metallic state, either in the puddling furnace itself, or subsequently from the tap cinder produced therein on its being smelted in combination with other ores. The cupreous pyrites of Spain and Portugal (Huelva and Tharsis ores), and certain other analogous substances from other countries, containing but little silicious matter or other ingredients besides iron, sulphur, and copper, are in consequence largely used by vitriol makers. The following table illustrates the average composition of Huelva and Tharsis ores before burning and subsequently, and also of the “purple ore” or “blue billy” left when the copper has been almost entirely extracted (together with quantities of silver and gold, relatively small, but absolutely sufficiently great to be a distinct source of profit) by conversion into chloride by heating in contact with air with sodium chloride and lixiviation of the product, the “purple ore” remaining undissolved :—
[table]

A valuable report on the character of various British iron ores is to be found in the Journal of the Iron and Steel Institute, 1871, whilst numerous analyses and descriptions of ores from almost all parts of the world are given in the volumes published during the last ten years or so.

6. Analysis of Iron Ores and of Metallic Iron and Steel. —The analysis of iron ores by the “dry method” (fusing with reducing agents, such as powdered charcoal, and suitable fluxes, and weighing the button of cast iron produced) has the advantage of giving in a comparatively short time a notion both of the amount of iron contained in the ore and of the presence or absence of phosphorus, manganese, &c. (judged of by the physical characters of the button), but has little to recommend it on the score of minute accuracy. The results are usually in excess of the iron actually present by to τ θ- π , on account of the button containing carbon, Ac.; whilst it does not by any means necessarily follow that the reduction of a given ore on the small scale in a crucible and on the large scale in a furnace will produce a metal of the same characters in each case. Accordingly the “wet method” of analysis (solution in appropriate solvents and separation of the various constituents from one another or other treatment equivalent thereto) is ordinarily preferred.

The ore, after being finely pulverized and sifted, &c., and representing a fair average sample of the material operated on, is dissolved in hydrochloric acid (if this fails by itself to produce ready solution, the ore may be heated to a low red heat in hydrogen so as to reduce to the metallic state, and then dissolved in hydrochloric acid); the ferric salt present is then reduced to the ferrous state by nascent hydrogen (evolved by adding fragments of pure zinc or other reducing agents, such as sulphur dioxide), and the amount of iron contained in the fluid determined either by adding a standard solution of potassium permanganate to the diluted flüid until a pink tint just appears (Marguerite), or by adding standard potassium dichromate solution until a drop of fluid just ceases to form a blue precipitate or greenish colour with potassium ferricyanide (Penny); the oxygen communicated by the test fluid being known from the volume of liquid consumed, the amount of iron peroxidized is known. When the ores contain iron in both the ferrous and ferric states, and the amount of each is required to be determined, the ore is boiled with hydrochloric acid, and the ferrous salt determined in one part of the solution, and the total iron in another portion. If the iron exist wholly or partially as carbonate, the amount of carbon dioxide may be determined by treating the finely pulverized ore with sulphuric acid in a suitably constructed apparatus, and weighing the apparatus after the (completely dried) gas has been wholly removed, or by absorbing the evolved gas in ammonia, boiling with calcium chloride, and weighing the precipitated calcium carbonate, a correction being made by means of a blank experiment for any ammonium carbonate originally present in the ammonia solution, or formed by absorption of carbonic acid from the air during the operation. Manganese is conveniently determined by dissolving the ore, peroxidizing if necessary, rendering nearly neutral, and boiling with sodium or ammonium acetate, whereby all iron and alumina present are thrown down as basic acetates, carrying with them all the phosphoric acid which is in solution; to this filtrate bromine is added (or it is saturated with chlorine), and the whole allowed to stand in not too cold a place for some hours, when the manganese is precipitated as a hydrated dioxide, or oxide approaching in composition thereto, which is collected, washed, ignited, and weighed as Mn 3 O 4 ; when more than a trace of manganese is present it may be determined volumetrically by several methods, e.g., Pattinson’s, consisting of addition of ferric chloride if the iron present is not already present in larger quantity than the manganese, of bromine water or calcium hypochlorite, and finally of freshly precipitated calcium carbonate, the liquid being at a temperature of 60° - 70° C.; the precipitate thrown down contains all the manganese as MnO 2 (Pattinson, Chem. Soc. Journal, 1879 [Transactions], p. 365), which may be estimated by dissolving with dilute sulphuric acid and a known amount of standard ferrous sulphate solution, and determining the iron which remains unoxidized by the MnO 2 , Kessler {Zeitsch. Anal. Chemie, 1879, 18, part i.) employs an analogous method for manganese determination, adding zinc chloride and bromine, boiling for a long time to ensure that all the manganese is precipitated as MnO 2 , and finally dissolving in solution of antimonious chloride in hydrochloric acid, and titrating the non-perchlorinated antimony by permanganate. Alder Wright and Menke {Chem. Soc. Journal, 1880 [Transactions], p. 22) find that Pattinson’s process gives more satisfactory results if zinc is present as well as iron in the precipitation of the manganese as MnO 2 , the formation of oxides of manganese lower than MnO a and of permanganate (which may sometimes otherwise [9:13:289] occur and cause error) being thus avoided; whilst they also find that a modification of a method originally due to Guyard (precipitation of manganese as MnO 2 by the addition of permanganate) will give good results provided that a zinc salt be added to ensure the formation of MnO 2 only, and that the amount of free acid be not too great. When it is required to determine the alumina dissolved by the acid employed to act on the original ore, the phosphoric acid in the total precipitate thrown down by the acetate treatment for the estimation of manganese gravimetrically may be determined; subtracting this and the Fe 2 O 3 from the weight of the precipitate, the Al a O, is approximately known; or the alumina may be separated by other processes, e.g., use of caustic soda, &c. Sulphuric acid, if present in the ore, is precipitated as barium sulphate from the hydrochloric acid solution of the ore; sulphur in the form of pyrites is determined by fusing the ore with sodium carbonate and nitrate in a gold crucible, and determining the total sulphate formed, the sulphate existing as such in the ore being subtracted. Phosphorus may be determined by dissolving the ore in aqua regia (usually the phosphorus exists as phosphate, and is wholly dissolved by hydrochloric acid), precipitating the phosphoric acid (best after separation of dissolved silica by evaporation to dryness and re-solution in dilute acid) in combination with part of the iron, by reducing most but not all the iron to the ferrous state, and then precipitating the ferric iron and phosphoric acid by boiling with an acetate; the precipitate is finally converted into magnesium pyrophosphate by solution in hydrochloric acid, addition of citric acid (less conveniently tartaric acid), ammonia, and magnesia liquor, and ignition of the precipitate collected after standing twenty-four hours; Eggertz’s method of determining phosphoric acid is, however, more suitable for the estimation of minute quantities, this depending on the precipitation by molybdic acid of a peculiar yellow crystalline phosphomolybdate of ammonium on bringing together the phosphoric acid solution (from which dissolved silica has been removed by evaporation to dryness) and excess of molybdate of ammonium solution supersaturated with nitric acid. Calcium and magnesium are conveniently determined in the filtrate from the basic acetate and phosphate of iron and alumina thrown down in the separation of •manganese gravimetrically, the filtrate from the precipitated manganese dioxide being employed, the calcium being first precipitated as oxalate, and then the magnesium as ammonio-phosphate; or the ferric oxide and alumina may be thrown down by ammonia free from carbonate, and the filtrate employed. Hygroscopic water and ordinary moisture are determined by drying at 100°, and noting the loss <>f weight; whilst combined water is subsequently determined by heating to redness in a tube through which dry air is aspirated, the issuing gases passing through a drying tube to absorb the water evolved; if nothing but water is lost on ignition, the weight so lost may be directly determined without collecting the water. Titanic oxide, chrome ironstone, complex silicates, kc., are often contained in the substance left undissolved by acid; for the modes of determination and analysis of these, and for the precautions in the determination of the soluble constituents should titanium be present and partly dissolved by the acid, &c., the reader is referred to larger treatises, in which also are to be found numerous methods of analysis other than those briefly indicated above.

The analysis of iron and steel is carried out on much the same lines as that of iron ores. The metal being dissolved in nitric acid or aqua regia, phosphoric arid is separated as above described, usually by Eggertz’s process, the acid solution being previously evaporated to dryness and treated with dilute hydrochloric acid, which leaves behind silica formed from the silicon present, graphite, and slag ; after ignition to burn off graphite, the silica is dissolved out by sodium carbonate solution and the residual slag weighed; in this way, however, more silica is generally obtained than represents the silicon originally present, as the silicates of the slag are apt to be more or less attacked by the acid; a better method for the determination of the slag is to dissolve the iron in bromine or iodine water, or by means of copper chloride (or mixed copper sulphate and ammonium chloride solution), which gives rise to cuprous chloride, dissolved out by heating; the slag is thus left undissolved, and may be weighed after boiling with sodium carbonate; the silica in the united sodium carbonate and bromine solutions being determined, the silicon is readily calculable. Manganese is determined just as in the case of ores. Sulphur is conveniently determined by treating with hydrochloric acid, and leading the evolved gases through a solution of lead or silver or some analogous metal, and finally converting the precipitated sulphide into barium sulphate; or by dissolving in aqua regia, evaporating, and converting the sulphuric acid found into barium sulphate: this method usually gives lower values than the others, barium sulphate not precipitating readily from very dilute highly acid solutions. The so-called “combined” carbon is found by determining the graphite left undissolved during the treatment of the metal with hydrochloric acid (by collection and burning to CO 2 in oxygen, and absorption in caustic potash), and subtracting the amount from the total carbon found by digesting with copper sulphate or chloride, or with bromine water, collection of the undissolved mass on an asbestos filter, and burning in oxygen, preferably with lead chromate in the front of the tube, to prevent chlorine or bromine vapours, &c., passing over, should the precipitate contain (through insufficient washing, &c.) substances which may evolve chlorine or bromine. Copper sulphate leaves behind an amount of copper equivalent to the iron dissolved; this covers up the finely divided particles of carbon, and diminishes the chance of pyrophoric oxidation and consequent loss of carbon during drying, which may otherwise occasionally take place, especially when the filter is dried by the aid of heat; but the solution of the iron is less rapid, and it is difficult to see or feel with a glass rod when all the iron is dissolved. Weyl dissolves the iron by making it the positive pole of a weak galvanic current passing through hydrochloric acid. Fresenius determines the “combined” carbon directly by dissolving in hydrochloric acid, passing the evolved hydrogen and carburetted hydrogen over red-hot copper oxide, and determining the carbon dioxide formed by absorption in potash as usual; if much sulphur is present, lead chromate should be employed to avoid errors due to formation of sulphur dioxide; if the amount of “combined” carbon is large, liquid non-volatile hydrocarbons are apt to be formed, which causes the method to yield too low a result. Ullgren determines the total carbon by oxidation to CO 2 in the wet way with chromic and sulphuric acids of the residue left after treatment with copper chloride or bromine; the results are apt to be too low, owing to incomplete oxidation of the graphite. Régnault determines the total carbon by heating the finely powdered metal with copper oxide or lead chromate, and absorbing the CO 2 produced by potash; by passing air over the finely divided metal at a low red heat, and when the ' oxidation is nearly complete finishing the operation in oxygen at a somewhat higher temperature, the use of copper oxide or lead chromate is rendered unnecessary; if too high a temperature and oxygen be employed at first, there is risk of forming fusible Fe 3 O 4 and of enclosing portions of carbonized unoxidized metal within a coating of that substance, which more or less protects it from the action of the oxygen, and tends to decrease the amount of CO 2 collected. Eggertz determines the “combined” carbon in steel by solution of a known amount of borings or filings in a known amount of nitric acid, and comparison of the fluid as regards its colour with a similar solution prepared from steel of a known carbon percentage, cr with a series of solutions of caramel made so as to exhibit the same tints as those yielded by steels of known carbon percentage when treated in this way. The principle of the method depends on the formation of soluble humus-like carbon compounds by the action of the nitric acid, probably analogous to the vegetable colouring matter of peaty water. Opinions differ widely amongst chemists as to the absolute accuracy of the method for general analytical operations, especially where nothing is known of the precise details of the mode of manufacture of the steel; but for a works laboratory, where speed is essential, and where it is only required to compare one specimen of steel with another one prepared in the same way but harder (the hardest steels being taken for the preparation of the standards, and the solutions representing the lower carbon percentages being obtained by diluting the fluid proportionately), the method is invaluable. For the sake of saving time under analogous circumstances, Eggertz somewhat modifies the above-described methods for the determination of sulphur and phosphorus, the amount of sulphur present being estimated by noting the discoloration produced on a plate of silver exposed to the gases evolved on solution in hydrochloric acid, or digestion with sulphuric acid, and comparing it with that produced under the same conditions from a metal of a known degree of sulphurization, and the amount of phosphorus being estimated by transferring the phospho-molybdic precipitate into a narrow measuring tube, and observing the volume occupied by it comparatively with that occupied by the precipitate similarly produced from metal containing a known amount of phosphorus. Sir J. Alleyne has described a method of determining approximately the quantity of phosphorus present in iron and steel by means of the spectroscope (Journal I. and S. Inst., 1875, 62). Nitrogen is determined by solution in hydrochloric acid free from ammonia, and titration by Nessler’s test of the ammonia formed (A. H. Allen, Chemical News, xlh 231, 1880). The less commonly· occurring substances, copper, chromium, arsenic, cobalt, nickel, zinc, aluminium, vanadium, titanium, tungsten, molybdenum, &c., are sought for and separated by special methods for which the larger text-books must be consulted.^[5. Parry and Tucker have employed the spectroscope successfully in this direction, see Journal I. and S. Jnst., 1880, 163. ] III. Extraction of Iron from its Ores.

7. History of the Manufacture of Iron and Steel.— Neither the period when malleable iron was first prepared from its ores nor the precise mode of manipulation then adopted is known with certainty, although the remains of iron [9:13:290] implements manufactured in prehistoric times are so numerous as to leave no room for doubt as to the extreme antiquity of the use of that metal instead of the yet earlier stone implements of primeval man. There is every reason to believe that the earliest methods of iron smelting essentially consisted in placing lumps of ore in a fire of wood or charcoal, and, after the lapse of a sufficient length of time to permit of their more or less complete reduction, hammer-_ ing the mass of spongy metal thus formed; so that what is known as the “Catalan forge” of modern times is but a comparatively slight modification of and improvement upon the oldest metallurgical appliances for the extraction of iron, the main difference being in the size of the apparatus and the use of an artificial air blast. Tradition assigns a very remote period to the first discovery of the possibility of extracting iron or crude steel from its ores, Tubal Cain (who has been compared with Vulcan) being the first name mentioned in connexion with the metallurgy of this substance. In the time of the Assyrians iron appears to have been in somewhat extensive use, saws, knives, and other analogous tools having been found by Layard at Nineveh, many of which are very similar to those in use at the present day. Both Homer and Hesiod refer to the forging of iron, whilst the hardening and tempering of steel also appear to have been operations in common use amongst the early Greeks; indeed the employment of a rough kind of bellows for the forging of tools (probably of iron) is figured in Egyptian sculpture of 1500 years and upwards b.c., —the inflation being accomplished by the aid of cords worked by the hand, whilst the pressure of the foot caused the expulsion of the air thus drawn in, much in the same way as is still practised by some almost savage Eastern nations, e.g., the Burmese. In the time of Pliny (about 50 A.D.) the existence of large masses of iron ore in Spain, Elba, Styria, and elsewhere was well known, these minerals being described by him as largely employed in the manufacture of iron and steel; whilst evidently the conditions requisite to produce the best temper of the latter had been carefully examined at that epoch, as he states that the quality of the steel depends on the nature of the water used to harden it, and that oil is preferable for small articles. Prior to this the discovery of cast iron or cast steel appears to have been made, for Aristotle (about 350 b.c. ) describes the preparation of the fused or fritted steely iron still prepared in India and known as u)ootz, whilst Galen refers to cutting knives made of this steel, and mentions that they are apt to be brittle through excessive hardness. Through the agency of the Romans the manufacture of iron was introduced almost all over the then known world, and into those regions where it had not been previously practised; this, however, does not appear to have been the case with Britain, as the use of iron was probably known there before the Roman invasion; the knowledge, however, may very possibly have been originally derived from the Romans through the Gauls.

The earliest kind of iron forge or bloomery was probably simply an excavation on the windward side of a hill; the application of an artificial stream of air doubtless soon followed, the blast being either produced by the alternate dilatation and compression of a bladder or goat skins, &c. (as still practised in India and elsewhere), or by means of a fan propelling air through a hollow tube, the fan developing into a kind of loosely fitting piston as still employed in Orissa, Borneo, Madagascar, and elsew∣herβ; so that the modern bellows and cylinder blowing machine are mere⅞y advanced and improved forms of these crude contrivances. The construction of a clay chamber to contain the fuel and ore, with the employment of a tuyere at the base, so as to be independent of the direction of the wind and of the nature of the ground, was doubtless an early improvement, and probably was the kind of forge used by the Romans, as it still is substantially that used by various Eastern races.^[6. For a description of the different kinds of rude furnace in use in Borneo and other Eastern districts, βeβ Percy’s Metallurgy. ] The use of valved single bellows is attributed to the

Romans in the 4th century by Franquoy; when these developed into double-acting bellows is uncertain, although it is known that such blowing machines were in use in the Harz and elsewhere about the beginning of the 17th century. The date of the invention of the trompe (or air blast, due to the fall of water and the carrying down of air with it) is also uncertain, but was probably a little later, near 1640 (François); its use was probably almost confined to the Pyrenees and similar districts where the requisite fall of water was readily obtainable from natural rivulets and torrents. Cylinder blowing machines were introduced at the Carron iron-works about 1760, water-power being usually employed when practicable at that period; some twenty or thirty years later, when the steam engine came into use, a great impetus was thereby given to the iron industry, as to most other trades, owing to the increased facilities in all directions given by the increased command of power thus obtained. The precise date of the introduction of cast iron is unknown; probably it was an accidentally formed product in the first instance, due to the employment of larger furnaces and increased blowing power; in the 14th and 15th centuries it appears to have been known, castings of this period made in Sussex (especially of the later date) being said to be still extant, whilst in the 16th century cannon ot some 3 tons weight each were cast by Johnson. About the end of the century the iron-works of Sussex and neighbouring counties had attained to such dimensions that their consumption of timber for fuel became a serious matter, so that an Act was passed in Elizabeth’s reign prohibiting their further extension. Probably this restriction was the cause of attempts being made to utilize coal as fuel in iron smelting, a patent for this purpose being granted in 1611 to Simon Sturtevant, who, however, does not seem to have been successful. Somewhat later Dud Dudley succeeded in producing both cast iron and malleable iron by the aid of coke, but met with so much opposition from the charcoal smelters that he abandoned the process; a similar result befell Strada in Hainault about the same time; a century later, however, about 1735, Abraham Darby of Colebrookdale reintroduced coke as fuel with complete success. About 1766-1784 great improvements in the mode of working malleable iron and of transforming cast iron into wrought iron were introduced, partly by Thomas Cranage of Colebrookdale, and Peter Onions, but more particularly by Henry Cort, who patented the use of groovedrolls so as to supersede hammering in 1783, and of the puddling forge in 1784. Since the invention of puddling, and its improvement by Rogers by the introduction of iron instead of sand bottoms, the main improvements in the iron manufacture are the use of the hot blast instead of cold air, due to Neilson, and patented in 1828; the employment of the waste gases from blast furnaces for raising steam, &c. (and subsequently for superheating the blast), first patented by Aubertot in France in 1811, and subsequently largely employed in most iron-producing districts, Scotland and Staffordshire excepted; the invention of the steam hammer by Nasmyth, patented in 1842; and the introduction of the Bessemer-Mushet process for steel making (1856) by blowing air through molten cast iron so as to burn out the carbon, and then adding spiegeleisen so as to produce a metal of any required degree of carbonization. In every department of the iron industry, however, numerous improvements have been made, amongst which must be specially mentioned the Siemens regenerative furnace and gas producer, and the improved processes for making steel thence resulting; the use of machinery in lieu of hand labour for puddling, introduced at first unsuccessfully by Tooth and Menelaus, and several others, but brought to a considerable degree of practical success by Danks, Crampton, and others; the casting of steel under great pressure, due to Sir Joseph Whitworth; the application of waste gases and the Siemens regenerative principle to the superheating of the blast by the Cowper-Siemens and Whitwell stoves; and the recently introduced improvements in Bessemerizing due to Snelus and to Thomas and Gilchrist, whereby even highly phosphorized pig is rendered capable of furnishing a fairly good quality of steel.^[7. A lengthy series of papers on the “History of Modem Invention in the Manufacture of Iron” has appeared in Iron, 1876 and following years, from which much detailed information on the subject may be obtained. ]

8. General Classification of Methods employed for the Extraction of Iron from its Ores.— The various modern developments of the earliest methods of iron extraction, consisting of the heating of iron ores with fuel until more or less complete reduction was brought about, and hammering the mass, may be conveniently divided into four classes, viz.:—(1) those in which cast iron is produced by a smelting process (§§ 9-21), and subsequently transformed into steel or wrought iron by decarbonizing the resulting pig iron (§§ 22-28); (2) those in which malleable iron or steel is obtained direct from the ore at one operation without [9:13:291] passing through the stage of cast iron (§§ 29—31); (3) those in which steel is formed from wrought iron by directly carbonizing it (§§ 32-35); and (4) those in which steel is finally prepared by intermixture of carbonized and wrought iron in the fluid state (§§ 36-41). The methods of class 1 include the preparation of pig iron; its purification by refining, and conversion into wrought iron by fining and puddling (both by hand and by machinery) and by inverse cementation (heating in contact with iron oxide); and the preparation of puddled steel and pneumatic steel and iron, i.e., steel prepared by Bessemer’s original process, viz., decarbonization more or less complete by blowing air through molten pig iron, and also of Heaton’s steel (pig iron decarbonized by nitrate of sodium), &c. Class 2 includes the Catalan forge and allied processes, and the “direct” methods of Clay, Chenot, Yates, Blair, Snelus, Du Buy, Siemens, aud others. The processes included in class 3 are those of steel manufacture by cementation and partial acieration by case hardening, together with various other allied methods of producing steel from soft iron; whilst class 4 includes the Bessemer-Mushet steel process, in which blown Bessemer metal is made into what is usually known as “Bessemer steel” by incorporating with it spiegeleisen; and the allied open hearth steel processes, in which wrought and cast iron are melted up together, or iron is decarbonized in a Siemens hearth and then mixed with ferro-manganese, &c.; together with various modifications of these processes, such as the Snelus-Thomas-Gilchrist method of blowing phosphorized pig, the Uchatius process, the Ronsard process, &c.

IV. Manufacture of Cast Iron.—Iron Smelting.

9. Preliminary Treatment of Ores. —Many kinds of ore are unsuitable for use in the blast furnace without some preliminary treatment,—consisting either of washing with water and dressing in the ordinary way adopted with heavy minerals to wash out clay, &c.; weathering by exposure to air and moisture for considerable periods of time so as to oxidize pyrites, &c., and wash out the soluble matters formed; roasting, so as to expel carbon dioxide and water and burn off organic matter, peroxidizing the iron in so doing; or a combination of some or all of these processes. Even with such ores as magnetic ironstone calcination is usually found to increase the ease with which the ores are subsequently smelted, the lumps being rendered somewhat porous, and hence more readily acted upon; indeed, with compact Swedish magnetites previous calcination is indispensable, otherwise great waste of fuel is occasioned. In the case of franklinite, a mangano-zinciferous magnetite, the mineral is first roasted with lime and anthracite so as to distil off the zinc, and the residue then smelted for spiegeleisen. Certain Westphalian and other ores are deprived of sulphur existing as pyrites by roasting in a kiln, into which superheated steam is admitted at intervals, whereby sulphuretted hydrogen is first formed and subsequently burnt to sulphur dioxide, whilst the iron of the pyrites is converted into oxide; by using a mixture of Ifighly carbonaceous blackband and other ores, the roasting is effected without the use of any fuel other than that contained in the blackband. Where fuel is not an object, calcination of iron stone is frequently effected in heaps analogous to those produced in the burning of “ballast” (clayey soil) for foundations of houses, roads, &c.; a fire of slack being made, shovelfuls of ironstone are thrown on to it, and then more slack and more ironstone alternately, until a sufficiently large heap is prepared; or the heap is first built up and subsequently fired, the spots where the fire comes visibly out of the heap being, when requisite, dampered over with moist small ore so as to prevent too rapid combustion, which might otherwise cause the ore to frit. Blackband usually requires only lighting with a little coal, &c., when properly heaped, furnishing its own fuel.

When economy in fuel is desirable, a calcining kiln is employed, generally resembling a lime kiln in construction. Fig. 1 represents a kind of kiln (Gjers’s) used extensively in the Cleveland district; it is usually built of firebrick cased with iron plates, circular in section, wider in the middle than at top, and tapering downwards from the middle slightly more rapidly than upwards. An iron double cone AA surmounts an orifice in the base connected with radiating flues B, B, whereby air is introduced into the interior. The whole superstructure rests on an annular cast iron entablature CC, supported on stout iron pillars D, D; the calcined ore is raked out i 'between these pillars, the spaces between them serving for the admission of air at the base; a further air supply is obtained from orifices E, E, E, E in the lower conical portion. A usual size is some 20 feet maximum diameter, and a little more in height, with a capacity of upwards of 5000 cubic feet; but considerably larger kilns are often used; the consumption of slack is from 4 to 5 per cent, of the. ore (Cleveland ironstone) calcined. Siemens has patented a somewhat analogous calcining furnace, combustible gas and air being led into the centre and distributed by a cone; Rachette’s calciner is oval, [9:13:292] with, three firing grates, two on one side and one on the other. The magnetic ores and quartzose haematites of Sweden, Russia, America, and elsewhere are often calcined in Westmann’s kiln (fig. 2). This is a nearly tubular vertical kiln slightly diminishing in diameter upwards, and fed at the base with waste gases from the blast furnace, together with air for their combustion; the ore is thus rendered somewhat less dense than at first, whilst pyrites, when present, is decomposed; analogous arrangements are employed in many Continental iron-works. Many attempts have been made to smelt clay ironstone without previous calcination, but as a generalrule but little saving appears to be effected, if indeed any at all is brought about; the value of the small coal and slack saved in the roasting barely, if at all, compensates for various practical disadvantages attending the use of raw ore as compared with calcined ores. Much the same remarks apply to brown ores, especially when earthy. Several methods have been proposed to remove phosphorus compounds from ores containing that constituent before smelting them, so as to produce a purer metal; the success of these as manufacturing operations, however, has been mostly indifferent, the cost and labour involved not being adequately repaid by the results. Amongst these processes may be noticed those of Jacobi and Velge; the former places the broken-up ores in tanks, and lixiviates them with aqueous solution of sulphurous acid obtained by burning pyrites; in this way phosphates are dissolved out, from which manures may be made; the latter impregnates the ores (previously calcined) with brine, and after drying calcines again, subsequently washing out the phosphate of sodium produced by water, or preferably water containing a little hydrochloric acid. Jacobi’s process has been tried on a considerable scale, and apparently could be worked commercially were it not that, to extract the phosphates thoroughly, the ore requires crushing to coarse powder, or at least to lumps so small as very materially to interfere with its employment in the blast furnace; moreover, whilst calcium phosphate is readily soluble in solution of sulphurous acid, ferrous phosphate is not soluble in that menstruum, and hence is not removed irom ores containing phosphorus in this form.

The ores being ready for smelting, the next stage in their treatment consists in subjecting them to the reducing action of carbon oxide (and also of carbon), at a temperature gradually increasing as the reduction goes on, until finally the reduced metal melts; in order to promote the separation of the earthy impurities of the ore from the metal, and to facilitate their fusion, it is requisite either to mix various classes of ores together in such a fashion that the silicious admixtures of the one and the calcareous and aluminous impurities of the others may jointly be in suitable proportions relatively to one another; or, which is usually more convenient, to add calcareous or other matters (in the form of limestone, ferruginous clay, aluminous poor iron ores, &c.) to serve as a flux. To carry out this operation the blast furnace is employed, the ore, flux, and fuel being charged in at the top of the erection, and air being blown in at the base, so that a mixture of carbon oxide and nitrogen is formed at the lower levels, which, passing upwards, effects the deoxidation of the ore; the heat produced at the base fuses the reduced iron and the earthy matters, &c., which accumulate in two layers (the former being the heavier), and are drawn off from time to time, the one as cast or pig iron, into moulds for the market, the other as cinder or slag, usually of little or no value. Fresh materials are added at the top, so that the furnace works continuously.

10. Fuel.— The fuel employed in iron smelting by means of the blast furnace is substantially always one of. three kinds, viz., raw coal (anthracitic, or more or less bituminous), coke, or charcoal;^[8. Peat has been used successfully as fuel in some Austrian furnaces, especially in the Vordernberg district, in open-topped furnaces about 30 feet high. The peat was made into compressed balls and dried in the air; these descended to the tuyere without losing their shape, but of course wholly carbonized. The iron produced was white, but of as good quality as that obtained with charcoal. Lignites and brown coal have similarly been employed in districts where better coals are scarce. ] inasmuch, however, as raw coal inserted into the mouth of a blast furnace speedily becomes coked, the combustible matter reaching the tuyere level is invariably carbon in a greater or less state of purity. The effect of using raw coal instead of coke in the first instance is chiefly marked as regards the alteration thereby produced in the character of the gases in the upper part of the furnace, and the consequent alteration in the chemical changes taking place, chiefly owing to the presence of hydrogen and hydrocarbons in much larger proportion. For numerous other operations in connexion with the metallurgy of iron, other kinds of fuel are often employed, lignites, turf, wood, &c. The following analyses will give an idea of the general character of the fuels usually employed. In the north of England a very hard variety of coke, often known as “Durham coke,” is made specially for iron smelters; during the production of this, on an average about one half of the sulphur originally present in the raw coal is expelled, the yield of coke being about two-thirds of the coal employed.
[table]
[table]

It is somewhat difficult to fix on an average value for the heat of combustion of coal, great variations being observable with different classes. The following values of Sch eurer Kestner and Meunier (Annales de Chim. et Phys. [4], 21, 436, and 26, 80) are calculated after allowing for ash, and on the supposition that the carbon dioxide and water produced were formed at the ordinary temperature, near 20’:—
[table]

Hence average true coal may be taken to have a heat of combustion of 9000 when ash free; assuming it to contain 5 per cent, of ash, 8550 will be the heat produced. If aqueous vapour at 20° were formed instead of liquid water, assuming average coal to yield 40 per cent, of aqueous vapour on complete combustion, 0 ’ 4× 593==237 heat units less would be evolved, 593 being the latent heat of water at 20° (Régnault); so that 8300 may be taken as an approximation to the heat of combustion of ordinary [9:13:293] coal burnt to carbon dioxide and water vapour at 20°. The heat of combustion of coke and charcoal is somewhat less than this: 1 part by weight of carbon gives out about 8000 units of heat, so that, if the coke contained 7 ’ 5 per cent, of ash and no appreciable amount of hydrogen, the heat of combustion (burnt to carbon dioxide) would be about 7400 (see § 20).

For certain purposes, and more especially for use in the blast furnace, the physical properties of the coke used are important; when caking coal is coked in furnaces so constructed as to permit of the collection of the products of the decomposition of the coal by heat, a larger yield of coke is obtained than is got when the coking is effected at a higher temperature brought about by the combustion of the volatile matters as fast as they are generated; but the softer coke obtained in the former way is less suited for smelting iron in the blast furnace than the harder variety obtained by the latter process; where lofty furnaces are in use, a hard coke that will stand the crushing action of the weight of the superincumbent materials answers better than a softer coke which is disintegrated by the pressure. Moreover, the hard compact form is less readily acted upon by carbon dioxide so as to produce carbon oxide (the carbon of the coke being gasefied) than is the case with the softer form of cθke; accordingly it results that when soft coke is employed in the blast furnace a larger amount of it is requisite per given weight of iron made than would be required were hard coke used instead; so that the greater yield of soft coke from the coal used in the first instance is counterbalanced, and even more than counterbalanced, by the increased quantity required to do the work of the furnace.

Crampton’s Furnaces.— For various purposes for which fuel is employed, whether for raising steam or producing a more or less oxidizing or reducing flame (e.g., in puddling), a form of flame-producer is available obtained by blowing into the furnace a jet of air carrying with it finely ground coal; for this purpose Crampton employs a mill like an ordinary flour mill with Derbyshire grit stones. The ground coal is placed in a hopper A (fig. 3) containing a sieve B, two agitators C and D stirring up the fine coal under the sieve, and urging it outwards through an opening E, the size of which is controlled by a sliding door F; from this opening it passes between rollers H and I, the distance between which can be regulated by a screw L acting on a lever MX, which adjusts the position of the bearings of the upper and smaller roller; in this way the feed is perfectly under control; the agitators cannot force out the coal-dust from the hopper at a greater speed than that regulated by the rollers. The stream of issuing coal-dust falls down a shoot K, a scraper O being provided to prevent adherence to the rollers; at the bottom of the shoot it is blown away continuously by an air blast, the shoot delivering the dust into the blast pipe continuously; the blast remaining the same, the amount of fuel is regulated by the screw and levers; or, the coal-dust supply being constant, the air blast can be varied. The flame thus produced on kindling the jet of air and coal (suitably proportioned to one another) is smokeless, and perfect combustion is effected with an intensely high temperature; for puddling and reheating furnaces, for heat-generating purposes generally, and for steam raising, the arrangement answers admirably {Journ. I. and S. Inst., 1873, 91, and 1874, 384; see §24).

Besides coal, coke, and charcoal, various other forms of combustible matter are used as sources of heat in certain of the operations involved in the extraction of iron from its ores. Among these may be mentioned the following.

Coal Tar.— At the Wyandotte Rolling Mil!s, Michigan, coal tar has been employed as fuel, being injected into the puddling furnace to be heated by means of a jet of superheated steam, which carries with it a certain amount of atmospheric air, the principle being much the same as that of firing tar-stills with waste naphtha. The steam at a pressure of four atmospheres (60 lb per inch) is superheated by forcing through a coil in the exit flue of the furnace, whereby it is raised to a red heat, and issues from a 1 1 8 ∙ or τ 1 s inch nozzle into an opening at the level of what would be the bridge were the ordinary firehole employed, the tar dripping down into the opening, and the air drawn in thereat being impelled onwards by the jet so as to fill the whole furnace with flame.

Petroleum.— Raw petroleum and the lighter benzoline obtained as a bye product in the manufacture of illuminating and lubricating· oils have been used in America as fuel applied in much the same way as the above-described. Experiments at Pittsburg indicated that for puddling and steel melting furnaces this fuel answered well, a consumption of a gallon of benzoline used in this way producing the heating effect of several times its weight of coal burnt in the ordinary fire-place.

Crude petroleum contains, according to Plagge,
[table]

Hence its calculated heat of combustion is about 11,300 per unit weight of substance burnt {i.e., 1 part by weight, on combustion to carbon dioxide and water, will give out heat enough to raise the temperature of 11,300 parts of water l o C.), or considerably in excess of that of charcoal and coke; if burnt to carbon dioxide and steam, the heat evolved by petroleum will be some 6 percent. less, or 10,600, that of coal being 8300 on an average, as stated above. At the Eames Iron-Works, Titusville, Pennsylvania, petroleum is allowed to trickle over a series of shelves in a chamber through which highly superheated steam passes; the current of combustible vapour produced is used for reheating and puddling furnaces, with the result of employing thirty barrels of petroleum daily for an output of iron that would otherwise require 40 tons of coal.

Natural Gas. — In Pennsylvania the gas evolved from petroleum wells and springs into a subterranean stratum (some 1600 feet below the surface) is largely utilized as fuel. One of the largest of these, the Delamater Well, some 30 miles from Pittsburg, was described in 1877 by Professor Laurence Smith as having at first yielded considerable amounts of petroleum, btιt then giving off nothing but gas coming up with a velocity of 1700 feet per second at the rate of about a million cubic feet per hour, or upwards of 1400 tons daily. In a 5f pipe at the well the pressure was 100 lb per square inch, so that large engines were worked by the gas current pressure alone. The illuminating power was about 7⅜ candles, or less than half that of good coal gas; the calorific effect was considerably superior to that of the most bituminous coal (weight for weight) on account of the much larger percentage of hydrogen (free and combined). Puddling and reheating furnaces fired with this fuel fed in through pipes in the rear of the fire bridge answer well, but emit some smoke; when it is used with a more plentiful supply of air under steam boilers, no smoke at all is produced. The composition of the gas from some of these wells is indicated by the following analyses by Sad tier :—
[table]

Caseous Fuel.— Various forms of arrangement for producing combustible gases in one place and leading them by means of tubes elsewhere to be burnt as fuel have been devised by numerous inventors. The object arrived at being essentially cheapness of production, the combustible substances have usually been coal, slack, lignites, shales, and the like, more or less submitted to distillation by the heat developed by the combustion of a part of the mass, the ultimate product of this combustion being largely carbon oxide formed by the action of the heated carbonaceous [9:13:294] matter on the carbon dioxide first formed. One of the most successful of these is the Siemens gas producer, which is applicable to the production of heat by means of gaseous fuel generated from all kinds of waste materials, such as shale and combustible rubbish of all sorts, and is represented in fig. 4; the air, being admitted only through the bars C, is converted into nitrogen and carbon oxide in its passage through the incandescent mass, whilst hydrocarbons and hydrogen are also evolved in the upper portion by the action of the heat on the organic substances used as fuel, passing off by the gas flue B. A is the charging hole for the introduction of fresh fuel; the ashes are stoked out from time to time from between the bars, which may with advantage be made capable of rotation about their own axes when shale is burnt, so as to facilitate the extraction of the burnt residue. E is a pipe which allows water to drip down into the ash pit D, and so to keep it always wet. The f ollowing analyses will give an idea of the composition by volume of the gas from such producers
[table]

When steam is allowed to pass into the producer along with the air, it reacts on the hot carbon of the fuel, producing “watergas” in virtue of the reaction

H a O + C-H i + CO.

The extent to which this can be safely done depends on the fuel burnt, the decomposition being attended by an absorption of heat; if more steam be admitted than can be decomposed, the surplus passes on unchanged and dilutes the gases, serving no useful purpose, but rather the contrary. Usually the small amount of steam requisite is produced by placing a water-tank underneath the grate, supplied continually with water as indicated in fig. 4, so that evaporation is set up by the radiating effect of the fire; only a relatively small volume is thus drawn in with the air used for combustion, but’ enough to give several parts per cent, of additional hydrogen and carbon oxide in the gas, and sensibly to increase the heating power. Roughly speaking, the calorific value of a unit of weight of gas from a Siemens producer is about 650; for one part by weight of carbon oxide will develop 2400 units of heat, and average gas contains about 25 per cent, by weight of carbon oxide with a little hydrogen (some 0 , 5 per cent, by weight), and hydrocarbons equivalent to some few parts per cent, more of carbon oxide. The mean specific heat of the gases being about 0 ‘24, an alteration in temperature of 300° would represent about 72 units of heat; or 11 per cent, of the heating power; so that by conveying the hot gases from a Siemens producer such a distance that their temperature is reduced by 300°, a considerable loss of effective heating power is experienced, amounting to about one-ninth of the actual heat developed by combustion. Partly owing to this cause, and partly owing to radiation, absorption of heat by the brickwork of the fireplace, &c., it has been calculated that the heat actually producible by means of gaseous fuel is only about two-thirds of that due to the fuel actually employed; but manifestly the latter sources of loss apply to solid fuel burnt in an ordinary firegrate just as much as to a gas producer. Experience shows that when the producers are near to the furnaces fed by them the fuel consumption is perceptibly lessened.

Siemens Regenerative Furnace, — The peculiar feature of this furnace is that the waste heat is employed to heat up both the gaseous fuel and the air requisite to burn it before they are introduced into the furnace or chamber in which they undergo combustion. This is effected by making the exit gases pass through “regenerators,” consisting of piles of firebricks stacked loosely together so as to expose as much surface as possible. Figs. 5 and 6 represent such a regenerative furnace as arranged for melting steel on an open hearth (Journal of Chemical Society, 1873, p. 661).

Four such piles are employed, two being heated up by the waste gases escaping from the melting furnace, whilst the other two are in use, the one for heating the gaseous fuel supplied from a Siemens gas producer, or from a gas main fed by several such producers, the other for heating he air requisite for the combustion of the gas. By suitable valves the waste gases are shunted from the first to the second pair of regenerators, whilst simultaneously the gas and air are changed from the second to the first pair; as the temperature at which the gas and air enter is close to that at which the products of combustion leave the furnace, whilst the regenerators are being heated up, the temperature of the combustion chamber continually rises (when not reduced by the introduction of cold substances) with each reversal of the currents through the regenerators; so that ultimately the only limit to the temperature attainable is the refractoriness of the materials of which the furnace is constructed. Even Welsh Dinas brick, which perfectly resists the ordinary steel melting [9:13:295] temperatures of coke-fired furnaces, even. when the least fusible mildest steels are being prepared, can be easily melted when the furnace is pushed; these bricks are made from a silicious clay (containing 98 - 31 per cent, of silica, 0 '72 of alumina, 0 ’ 18 of ferrous oxide, 0 - 22 of lime, 0 ’ 14 of potash and soda, and 0’35 of combined water), mixed with 1 per cent, of lime, and are usually considered the most refractory in ordinary use. A specially prepared brick made from a mixture of crushed pure quartz and 2 per cent, of lime answers much better. Bauxite bricks are somewhat less refractory, and have the further objectionable quality of shrinking much when highly heated, whilst fresh bauxite introduced for repairing cavities caused by wear and tear will not adhere properly to them; where ores requiring lime as flux are employed, however, they are less readily corroded than silica bricks. The hot air and gas currents and the waste gases are reversed through the regenerators at convenient intervals by means of a cast iron valve on the principle of a four-way cock; when the regenerators are placed vertically and heated from the top, their action is more uniform than when the draught is in any other direction; they should be at a lower level than the heating chamber, and may be worked either with a gas pressure just about atmospheric, or preferably with a slightly increased pressure so as to avoid possible chilling of the furnace by the drawing in of cold air, the pressure being regulated by the chimney damper and the valves governing the gas and air supplies.

Since the composition of the gas from a Siemens gas producer is, roughly speaking, somewhat less than one-third carbon oxide or gases equivalent thereto, and somewhat more than two-thirds nitrogen and carbon dioxide, and as carbon oxide requires half its volume of oxygen and hence about two and a half times its volume of air for complete combustion, the volumes of gas and air equivalent to one another are roughly equal; but, since an excess of air is usually requisite, and is indispensable when an oxidizing atmosphere is desired, the regenerators by which the air is heated are made somewhat larger than those used for heating the gas; by suitably adjusting the speed of the air current by the valve, the atmosphere can then be rendered neutral, reducing, or oxidizing at will. This point is of less importance for other applications of the regenerative furnace such as glass making or steel melting in crucibles than it is for puddling and reheating furnaces. For every pound of coal burnt per hour about 6 square feet of surface is requisite in the regenerators to take up the heat; whilst about 60 lb weight of brickwork is requisite to expose the surface to the best advantage, i.e., between three or four times the weight of brickwork which would have the same capacity for heat as the waste gases (equal to about 17 ft>).

Bundin'sfurnace (or gas producer), employed in Sweden for the production of gas from moist sawdust, is constructed on much the same principles as Siemens’s gas producer, saving that the air is driven in by a blast; as the sawdust contains upwards of 40 per cent, of moisture, the steam and hot gases passing off from the furnace are cooled down, and the former condensed, by jets of water-spray and a kind of scrubber consisting of piles of iron pigs over which water flows. Peat and turf can be used with the same arrangement, if not too wet. The gas evolved from sawdust has about the following composition after condensation of steam, exclusive of about 3 volumes per cent, of aqueous vapour :—
[table]

Brook & Wilson's Producer (fig. 7) consists of a solid hearth with no firebars: the coal is fed in at the top by means of a hopper-shaped conical tube closed by a “bell and cone” arrangement; the air requisite for combustion is supplied by means of a steam jet, and blows into a bell-mouthed pipe outside, communicating with a boxshaped cast iron chamber in the middle of the base of the producer; this chamber, being perforated, distributes air and steam uniformly throughout the mass of fuel, and so prevents unchanged steam and excess of air from passing away in the gases, which are led away by a tube communicating with the annular upper part of the producer between the hopper and the outer wall. Siemens has recently introduced a modification of his gas producer differing chiefly from this one in details of construction, being more simple. The Tcssié du Motay generator is in form like a small close-topped blast furnace fed by means of a cup and cone with coal dust or other low-class fuel; the hearth is cylindrical, with a brick bottom, on which are formed four channels, each communicating at its ends by passages with cast iron mouthpieces or windboxes, connected with an annular blast main through which blast is supplied at a pressure of about 8 inches of water. Doors are provided at the mouthpieces for the removal of ashes from time to time (see Engineering, April 23, 1880). Several other gas producers have been introduced by various inventors, and are employed to a greater or lesser extent; the limits of the present article forbid these being discussed.

Peat and peat charcoal have been proposed by Kidd as sources of gaseous fuel. Steam at a pressure of 20 lb being injected, together with a considerable volume of air carried along with it, into a mass of incandescent peat charcoal in a suitable chamber produces a fuel of much the same composition as that obtained from a Siemens gas producer, but absolutely free from sulphur dioxide. Keates eives the folio win s analvsis of eas thus produced :—

11. Fluxes and Cinder.— When a very pure iron ore is smelted, such as Cumberland haematite or Swedish magnetite, the amount of silicious and earthy matter present relatively to the iron oxide is but small, and in consequence the amount of flux requisite to be added is also small. By proper combination of ores of different kinds the necessity for the addition of flux may be almost or altogether avoided; thus a highly aluminous ferric oxido known as bauxite (valuable as a source of aluminium and its compounds, as well as serviceable as a source of iron and flux in the blast furnace) and silicious haematite smelted [9:13:296] together, with the addition of a little limestone or quicklime, furnish a cinder consisting mainly of calcareous aluminium silicate which readily melts and separates from the pig iron; similarly aluminous shales from the Coal Measures may be used instead of bauxite, whilst certain Swedish ores naturally containing as gangue fusible silicates of lime and magnesia, together with limestone, can be smelted without any additional flux of any kind, and will even serve to take up the silicious gangue from other ores when smelted with them if the latter are not in too large a proportion. On the other hand, clay ironstone and clayey ores generally usually require a considerable admixture of limestone or quicklime in order to yield a sufficiently fusible cinder, the presence of a sufficiently large amount of basic matter (lime and magnesia, or manganese oxide) in the cinder being essential in order to prevent the pig iron from taking up too much sulphur from the coke or coal when these fuels are employed. Phosphorus, however, when present in either the ore, the flux, or the fuel, is almost entirely taken up by the pig iron, as was shown in 1838 by Berthier, and subsequently confirmed by other observers; thus Lowthian Bell found that in a furnace smelting Cleveland ironstone, with a consumption per 100 parts of pig of
[table]

and a formation of 150 parts of cinder containing 0Ό98 per cent, of phosphorus, the amounts of phosphorus leaving the furnace in the slag and pig iron respectively were almost exactly 10 and 90 per cent of the total phosphorus present; whilst in the same series of experiments the sulphur retained by the iron and that passing out in the slag were respectively between 2 and 2 , 5 and between 97 - 5 and 98 per cent, of the total sulphur present (which amounted to upwards of 4 parts per 100 of pig).

According to Riley the amount of phosphorus retained in the slag is greater the more iron is present. When the reduction of the metal is all but complete, and the furnace consequently is working well, the pig contains practically all the phosphorus present, whether it be white or grey; but if the slag becomes more or less of a “scouring” character through incomplete reduction of considerable amounts of iron, notable quantities of phosphorus are also present therein. Witherbee finds that a certain small amount of phosphorus contained in the charge fails to appear in the pig iron, this amount being greater the higher the temperature of the hearth, i.er, being greater when Bessemer pig is being run than with iron smelted at a lower temperature. This he explains by supposing that phosphorus is volatilized in the furnace, a view apparently corroborated by direct experiments made by Akermann.

Some of the Lincolnshire ores are imbedded in a calcareous matrix or gangue; in order to smelt these an admixture of silicious ore is necessary. For this purpose the more or less silicated forge mill cinders from the manufacture of malleable iron are frequently used, these substances virtually constituting rich iron ores, the only drawback of which is that their texture is compact, and they generally are in small pieces, so that they could not be smelted advantageously alone; moreover, they usually contain considerable quantities of phosphorus, if that constituent was present to any extent in the original pig used for puddling, mill cinder (the scale formed and detached during rolling) being much purer in this respect than forge cinder (the molten slag squirted out during hammering).

When any notable amount of manganese oxide is present in the cinder, it is generally very fluid and easily fusible; accordingly, when a furnace shows a tendency to “scaffold” (by the fritting together of lumps which form a comparatively solid skeleton mass inside the furnace, preventing the charge from descending properly), a manganiferous ore is sometimes employed as a sort of flux to assist in removing the obstruction by melting it down. In Sweden, when sulphur is present in the ores to an undue amount (through imperfect calcination, &c. ), it is usual to add some titaniferous ore to the charge (some 10 per cent, or so); the pig is thereby prevented from taking up the sulphur, possibly through the formation of titanium sulphocyanide. In the anthracite furnaces at Cedar Point, U.S., it was found that a much more fluid cinder was produced when a magnesian limestone, containing 67 per cent, carbonate of lime and 27 per cent, carbonate of magnesia, was used than with ordinary limestone of 95 per cent, carbonate of lime, other things being the same.

As a general rule it may be said that the composition of the cinder from a blast furnace working satisfactorily varies between that of an orthosilicate, 2RO,SiO 2 or 2R 2 O 3 ,3SiO 2 , in which the oxygen of the bases presept is equal to that of the silicon dioxide, and that of a metasilicate, RO,SiO 2 or R 2 O 3 ,3SiO 2 , in which the oxygen of the bases is one half of that of the silicon dioxide,—the dyad metals being essentially calcium and magnesium, and with certain ores manganese, whilst the triad metals are usually only represented by aluminium. More or less ferrous oxide is, however, invariably present; caeteris paribus, the darker the colour of the shag the more iron it contains. When the furnace is working properly the amount of ferrous oxide is small, not exceeding 1 or 2 per cent, of the cinder; but when the reduction of the iron is imperfect, and a “scouring cinder” is being produced, the quantity of ferrous oxide present may amount to one-fifth or more of the cinder, representing a very large loss of metal. The following analyses represent the composition of various kinds of limestones and other fluxes employed :—
[table]
[9:13:297]

would be were less carbon dioxide introduced in the form of flux, since the total amount of dioxide in the escaping gases is limited (see § 20); accordingly, a further saving in fuel might be expected to accrue by calcining the limestone previously, when large amounts of limestone flux are employed. The two sources of saving jointly sometimes considerably exceed the fuel expenditure in the limekiln during the process of burning the lime; thus at Ougrée, near Liege, comparative trials lasting over some three and a half years indicated not only increased production but also a notable saving in fuel when lime was used. Two similar furnaces gave the following results per unit of iron run (A), the results (B) being obtained with the same furnace throughout:—
[table]

Analogous results, but not so strongly marked, were obtained by Eck at the Royal Smelting Works, Upper Silesia :—
[table]
[table]

From these results as well as others described by Percy (Metal 3 lurgy}, and by Griiner (Annales des Mines [vi.], xx. 525) and others, it would seem that, with certain ores at any rate, a distinct i>ractical advantage attends the use of quicklime instead of raw imestone. On the other hand, Lowtlιian Bell regards the advantage with Cleveland ores as at least doubtful, his own experiments unmistakably indicating “that the expense of calcining the limestone was unaccompanied by any advantage whatever in the operation” (Jenem. I. and S. Institute, 1875, 406); similar results have also been observed by others.

As regards the quantity of flux requisite to produce good results, no general statements can be made, the proportion being highly variable with circumstances, and especially with the nature of the ore. Thus, with Cleveland ironstone containing after calcination some 40 per cent, of iron, about 11 cwts. of limestone are usually requisite per ton of pig iron, or about 22 per cent, of the weight of “mine” used. Much larger quantities have been employed at various Continental works using poor ores with much earthy matter, up to 20 cwt. and more per ton of iron; on the other hand, some of the Swedish ores require no flux at all, and Lake Superior ores often do not require more than some 2 cwts. of limestone per ton. When it is practicable to mix aluminous, calcareous, and silicious ores together, the amount of flux otherwise requisite may be largely reduced; but the conditions governing the amount and nature of flux to be used are too variable to be briefly generalized.

12. Construction of Blast Furnaces.— Intermediately between the comparatively open hearths of the Catalan forge and analogous early arrangements for the direct production of iron from its ores (§ 29) and the completely closedin blast furnaces of gigantic dimensions in use at the present day, may be classed the smaller closed-in blast furnaces used amongst various nations, the products of which were either something approaching to malleable iron, more or less carbonized and imperfectly fused, a fused or semi-fused steel, or a completely melted more highly carbonized cast iron, according to circumstances. Of this intermediate class of furnace the “Stückofen,” or high bloomery furnace, formerly considerably used on the Continent, may be taken as a type. By increasing the amount of fuel relatively to the ore smelted, a completely fluxed cast iron resulted, run out as in the ordinary modern blast furnace through a tapping hole; with less fuel,ie., increased “burden,” the product approximated more to the pasty mass produced in the Catalan forge, being extracted as a ball through a much larger opening in the hearth than was necessary for simple tapping; in this latter mode of working the cinder was usually allowed to escape pari passu with its formation so as not to allow the mass of reduced metal to be covered and protected from the oxidizing action of the blast, otherwise a too highly carbonized metal resulted. Essentially the Stückofen was a brickwork tower of some 10 to 15 feet in height, the inner cavity being shaped like two truncated cones placed base to base; in short differing from the ordinary blast furnaces for producing cast iron in little but dimensions. As far back as 1841 these appliances were stated by Karsten to have been entirely abandoned in Carinthia, Carniola, and Styria (where formerly they were largely employed), on account of their large consumption of fuel; at that period they were still in use to a small extent in Hungary and near Henneberg in Germany. The “Osmund” furnace, formerly in use in Sweden for converting bog iron ores into malleable iron, was essentially a Catalan forge with the sides built up to a height of several feet so as to constitute a small blast furnace entirely closed in save at the top.

The modern blast furnaces for pig iron production in use in different districts vary considerably in the details of their construction. The changes that have been introduced during the last half century are mainly in the direction of increased size, which up to a certain point has been found advantageous so far as the consumption of fuel is concerned, at any rate with certain classes of ore. Thus about 1830 the largest furnaces in use in Great Britain were usually but little upwards of 40 feet in height, with a capacity of 4000 to 5000 cubic feet, and were often much smaller; about 1864 Vaughan of Middlesborough built a much larger one, 75 feet high; at the present day furnaces of 80, 90, and even upwards of 100 feet in height and of 20,000 to 40,000 cubic feet capacity are in use in certain localities, some of the largest being those at Ferryhill and Ormesby in the Middlesborough district, furnaces of 103⅛ feet in height and 33,000 cubic feet capacity, and of 9Ö feet in height and 40,000 cubic feet capacity, having been built at these places respectively. The researches of Lowthian Bell on blast furnaces smelting Cleveland ironstone, and the practical experience of iron smelters using this ore alone, or mixed with haematite, coincide in indicating that, whilst a considerable saving in fuel consumed (several cwt.) per ton of iron of given quality made at a given rate of working from a given class of ore and flux accompanies the increase in dimensions from 40 or 50 feet in height and 5000 or 6000 cubic feet capacity up to about 80 feet in height and some 12,000 cubic feet capacity, the economical effect of increasing the dimensions beyond these limits is not marked, although, according to Bell, a further increase in capacity up to some 15,000 or 16,000 cubic feet (without increase of height beyond 80 feet) appears on the whole to tend to increase of regularity during working. On the other hand, when a very hard coke (such as that specially made in Durham and Northumberland for the purpose) is not obtainable as fuel, or when very friable ores are employed, the extra weight of material in a very high furnace so crushes and pulverizes the ore and fuel as seriously to interfere with the working; so that with charcoal or soft anthracite or other coal as fuel, or with ores which either at first or when partially reduced have but little coherence, the disadvantages of increasing the size of the furnace beyond certain limits outweigh the benefit derived from the saving of fuel Accordingly the 80 feet furnaces and upwards of the Cleveland district are but little used out of England; the furnaces employed in the North Lancashire and Whitehaven districts, where haematite mainly is smelted, are usually 60 to 70 feet in height, and those in use in the United States for similar ores rarely exceed 55 to 65 or 70 feet in height, with a maximum width of 15 or 16 feet at the boshes, and are often only from 40 to 50 feet in height; whilst furnaces very much smaller than these are in use both in America and on the Continent where charcoal iron is made; thus at Vordernberg in Styria furnaces of only some 28 feet in height, 6 feet greatest internal diameter, and 450 cubic feet capacity were in use a few years ago and probably are still, whilst in various places [9:13:298] in Sweden, Norway, and Lapland furnaces of 30 to 40 feet in height and 1000 to 2000 cubic feet capacity are employed. Of late years, however, large furnaces have been built in Sweden of 50 to 60 feet in height, especially for Bessemer pig smelting.

The internal shape of the blast furnaces in general use is somewhat variable. Those of the older construction may be described as being made up of two truncated cones placed base to base, the greatest diameter (the boshes) being about one-third way up; those of more recent construction exhibit much less angle at the boshes, and are internally shaped more like a barrel, or like an inverted soda water bottle with most of the neck and the conical bottom cut off. Fig. 8 illustrates the alterations in size and shape that have taken place in the blast furnaces of the Cleveland district during the last thirty years or so (abridged from a paper by J. Gjers, Journal Iron and Steel Institute, 1871, ii. 202). Similar alterations in dimensions and shape of furnaces have taken place in other localities. The smaller furnaces of 30 to 35 or 40 feet in height have mostly been replaced (when worn . out) by larger and higher ones, the angles of the internal cavities of the older shapes being rounded off.

Fig. 9 illustrates the section and ground plan of one of the plder form of open-mouthed furnaces used at Dowlais (Truran), consisting of a heavy mass of masonry, square at base, strongly braced together with iron tie-rods, rising in the shape of a truncated pyramid to the height of the boshes, and then surmounted with a conical top surrounded at the throat by a gallery for the introduction of the charging materials. In the square base were four arched recesses or tuyere houses, one on each side, F, F, for the introduction of the blast through blowing holes by means of tuyeres, the front recess G also serving for the removal of cinder and the tapping of the furnace for the running of the pig. The lowest portion of the hearth or crucible, A, was constructed of refractory sandstone, grit, or conglomerate, or of difficultly fusible firebrick, the inner portion of the upper part of the furnace being also built of firebrick set in fireclay with an air course between the double lining thus constructed; ex- .teriorly the furnace was built of less expensive and refractory materials, usually of stone, strongly bound round with iron hoops. Above the charging gallery D a slighter brickwork continuation of the internal cavity arose, E, termed the tunnel head, in which door-holes, closed with movable iron doors, were perforated for the introduction of the charge. At the level of the boshes BB or thereabouts, the pyramidal base was finished off exteriorly with a cap or coping, the conical shaft C rising upwards therefrom. Fig. 10 represents a somewhat later form, chiefly differing from the former in that the base is circular instead of square, the whole forming a truncated cone into which the tuyere houses A,A,A,B are sunk, the cinder notch and tapping hole for the outflow respectively of the cinder and pig iron being in the tuyere house B, towards which the walls of the hearth and crucible are cut away; the outer portion of this form of furnace consisted of a shell of boiler plate rivetted together, and. the masonry was considerably less massive than that of the older form. The more modern furnaces (such as fig. 11) are constructed like this, but the masonry at the base is still less massive, so that, instead of there being four distinct tuyere houses, the separating walls of the houses are wholly cut away and replaced by a number of stout iron pillars on which rests the greater portion of [9:13:299] the weight of the superstructure; through the walls of the hearth are pierced conical arched openings for the tuyeres; the throat is fitted with a valve for introducing materials from time to time, such as the cup and cone arrangement (see § 18). Just below the cup a perforation through the furnace wall allows the gases to pass out into a down flue of rivetted boiler plate through which the, gases pass (when the cone is in its normal raised position) to the boiler fires, blast superheaters, &c.; in order to prevent the fire being extinguished when the cone is lowered, a small coal fire is kept burning under the boilers, &c., unless the temperature of the fireplace is sufficiently high to relight the gases when the cone is again raised. Even at the present day, however, many furnaces are in use of the open-mouthed class, the escaping gases simply passing into the air through the tunnel head as a mass of roaring flame, unless the temperature is too low to enable them to ignite spontaneously, in which case they escape without flame except when accidentally or intentionally lit.

The precise angle made at the boshes between the lower and upper portions of the inner furnace wall is a matter of some moment. If the hearth slopes too gently, the fall of the materials downwards as the reduced metal and cinder melt is apt to be retarded, and “scaffolding” to be produced. Modern furnaces usually have the walls of the hearth more nearly vertical than the older ones, whilst the shaft instead of being conical from the boshes upwards is often cylindrical for -some considerable distance, then gradually closing in barrel-wise towards the throat; the tuyeres also are often more than four, especially in the larger furnaces. In some of the furnaces in use some twenty years ago and upwards, the hearth was originally built square in plan, like the still older ones of half a century back and more; but observation of the fact that the hearth of blown-out furnaces was always corroded or fused away to an irregular circular outline, and that the same kind of effect was also Îiroduced in the inner ining of the boshes and shaft where an angle originally existed, led to the gradual substitution of inner cavities shaped in the first instance as much as possible like the ultimate shape to which the furnace became corroded.

In building a blast furnace, the “stack” or upper portion is usually constructed first on its supporting columns, the hearth and its outer casing being built in subsequently. The firebrick used for the purpose should be as free as possible from iron, otherwise it is apt to be disintegrated by the reducing action of carbon oxide on the ferruginous matter, a continual reduction of iron and reoxidation of the metal with deposition of carbon being produced in virtue of the reactions described in § 19, equations (3) and (4); according to Pattinson ’ s observations {Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1316, 101) this action has in several instances caused considerable injury when iron was present to a notable extent (3 or 4 per cent.). In Austria and Hungary steatite is often used for lining the charcoal furnaces in use there; serpentine has also been employed, but is not so advantageous on account of the difficulty in obtaining it of uniform texture and sufficient compactness; it does not wear so well as good firebrick. The hearth and foundations frequently require to be specially prepared, consisting of a large mass of concrete, broken stone, &c., with air courses interspersed; above this is the hearth bottom, formerly made of one or more large slabs of sandstone or grit, but with the modern large furnaces of masses of firebrick or sandstone laid inverted domewise, or like the under portion of a barrel drain, to diminish the tendency to undermining and forcing upwards by the molten metal and slag. The crucible and hearth are then constructed of as great thickness and as infusible material as convenient, so as to increase the time requisite before renewal is necessary, owing to the solvent action continually being exerted by the cinder, especially when the furnace is working irregularly and forming a slag containing much unreduced iron {semiring cinder) which attacks the hearth lining powerfully. The tuyere holes are built in as conical perforations through the hearth wall at a level of some few feet above the bottom, —the front tuyere hole being made into an arched recess (like the old “tuyere house,” but on a smaller scale) reaching from the bottom to a level of 2 or 3 feet above the other tuyeres; the tymp arch usually projects a little forward from the earth wall, constituting the “fore hearth,” at the base of the front of which is the dam, a block of stone or mass of firebrick pierced by a vertical cavity {tapping hole), the bottom of which is on a level with the base of the hearth, and through which the molten pig iron is drawn off from time to time, the liquid metal being dammed back by ramming a mixture of clay and sand or small coal into the hole when the furnace is not being tapped, and the stopping being withdrawn by hammering with a pointed crowbar when all is ready for tapping. The top of the dam [9:13:300] is nearly on a level with the tuyeres, and has a groove {cinder notch) cut in it forming a channel through which the cinder continuously flows out when the iron and cinder have risen to a level with the top of the dam since the last tapping; occasionally the top of the dam is raised to a somewhat higher level than the tuyeres, when it consequently results that the blast is blown in through and not over the liquid cinder. The space between the dam and the top of the tymp arch is filled up with brickwork, or with clay and sand, &c., with the exception of the cinder channel terminating in the cinder notch; when the furnace has been tapped and the level of the cinder has sunk below the notch, this cavity is temporarily stopped until the cinder level rises again, to prevent the blast issuing from the hole. In order to prevent wearing away of the dam, water cooling arrangements are sometimes applied analogous to those used for the hot-blast tuyere (§ 15); various arrangements of this kind are in use, notably Liirman’s.

On the Continent the older massive round or square-based class of furnace (of variable dimensions in different localities) is still employed to a considerable extent. In some of the smaller-sized furnaces, such as those in use in Sweden and Finland, the heavy external masonry is replaced by a log casing, prevented from heating by a jacket of earth and rock between it and the furnace casing proper. When the furnaces are only in blast at certain seasons (being blown out during the rest of the year), holes for the escape of moisture from the interior brickwork or stonework on relighting are usually provided. The hearth is constructed of a mixture of fireclay and crushed quartz or old used fireclay moulded whilst soft into shape by being rammed in between the outer casing and a wooden internal mould and carefully dried gradually before use. Rachette’s furnace (fig. 12),^[17. Taken from Bolley’s Handbuch der Chemischen Technologie vol. ii., part ii., by Dr C. Stölzel. ] adopted at Nijne Tagilsk and elsewhere in the Urals, atMulheim on the Rhine, and in a modified form in certain copper smelting works, differs considerably in shape from the ordinary English form; the shaft A is an inverted foursided pyramid, the throat being the widest part of all, about 7 feet wide and 18 long; towards the hearth D the width diminishes to 2 - 75 feet, the total height being about 30 feet. At each end of the oblong hearth is a slaghole and a tapping hole, C, C. The tuyeres B, B are some dozen in number, arranged in two ranks opposite to one another, each tuyere on one side being midway between the axes of two adjacent tuyeres of the opposite side. In order to keep the walls cool air courses E,E are built under the hearth and others 0,0,0 in the walls of the shaft, all communicating with one another; when the furnace is being blown in these also serve to heat up the walls and dry them, fuel being placed in the lowest and largest air space E and fired. The chief advantages claimed for this form of furnace are that its small height and comparatively slight construction render it far less costly to build than more massive furnaces; that the ascending current of gases must slacken in vertical speed as it reaches the wider uppermost portion, and must consequently be more efficaceous in reducing the ore than in furnaces the shafts of which taper the other way at top, so that the yield of iron relatively to the cubic capacity is larger; and that when first built it can be blown in much sooner than ordinary furnaces owing ⅛> the air courses. The yield of one of the Ural furnaces, when smelting a rich magnetic ore furnishing 67 per cent.'of grey pig with charcoal and cold blast, was from three to three and a half times that of the old type of furnace (measured for equal cubic capacity! the consumption of fuel being from 10 to 15 per cent, less (Stolzelk

A peculiar furnace, known as Ferrie’s self-coking furnace, after the name of its inventor, in which raw coal is employed, has been used at the Monkland Iron works and elsewhere during the last few years. On the top of an ordinary furnace of about 53 feet in height and 7000 cubic feet capacity were erected four chambers or retorts about 2D feet in depth, each having a capacity of 500 cubic feet; external flues, in which a portion of the waste gases weηe burnt, served to heat these chambers in such a way as to coke the raw coal, the temperature of the flues being about 800 q to 900° C. Fig. 13, taken from the Journal Iron [9:13:301] and Steel Institute, 1871, i. p. 433, illustrates the arrangement. That part of the gas not consumed in the coking retort flues is led off by the usual bell and cone arrangement.

Before these chambers were erected the quantity of raw coal requisite to make a ton of pig from the Lanarkshire ironstone averaged about 52 , 5 cwt.; the addition of the coking chambers reduced the amount of coal to 33 ’ 5 cwt., producing a saving of 19 cwt. of raw coal, equivalent to upwards of 12 cwt. of coke per ton of iron. According to Lowthian Bell this result is largely due to the increase in the height of the furnace produced by the addition of the coking chambers; i. e., a large proportion of the saving (estimated by Bell at about one half) would have been brought about by an increase in furnace height, even though the upper part were not specially heated by the combustion of waste gases, the balance being due, first, to the avoidance of a large portion of the heat absorption during the coking of the coal that would otherwise have taken place at the expense of the heat developed by chemical changes in the upper part of the furnace, owing to the supply of heat from the combustion of waste gases in the external flues, and, secondly, to the modifying action of the hydrocarbons developed on the chemical changes themselves, the direction of the modification being that of increased rate of reduction of iron oxide. In any case, the consumption of fuel is by no means inferior to that which with the most advantageous conditions will suffice to smelt a given iron ore (§ 21). For further details see Journal Iron and Steel Institute, loc. cit., and 1871, ii. 228. A modification of this furnace has been tried, in which the coking chambers at the top are connected with condensers for collection of tar and ammoniacal liquor; the fuel only is placed in these chambers, the mine and flux being introduced at their base.

Double Rows of Tuyeres.— Experiments have been made, notably at Pittsburg, U.S., on furnaces with two sets of tuyeres, one row at a lesser height above the sole than that of the other row, both rows used simultaneously; the general effect has been found to be the reverse of advantageous. It is, however, frequently convenient to have two or more tuyeres symmetrically disposed round the furnace at a somewhat higher level than those ordinarily used, the higher series being employed, not in the ordinary working of the furnace, but only in case of certain derangements of working such as scaffolding, &c.; accordingly several furnaces of recent construction, especially in America, have been thus fitted with “auxiliary tuyeres,” at 16 to 18 inches level above the others, ready for use when occasion needs. In certain cases when scaffolding had taken place to such an extent that the furnace did not give any fused matter at all at the hearth, and it was probable that it would have to be put out of blast and partly unbuilt, proper working has been brought about and the obstruction removed by what was thought when first practised to be a desperate remedy, viz., cutting holes in the shaft at some elevation (15-20 feet) above the tuyeres and introducing by means of temporary tuyeres blast at the orifices thus formed, so as to flux away the obstructing matter. In certain American works scaffolds have been melted away by introducing a little above the tuyere a pipe communicating with a barrel of petroleum, so as to create an intense local heat by the combustion of the petroleum allowed to run in in a gentle stream.

13. Hoists and Lifts.— Except when the natural variations in the level of the ground permit of the materials being drawn in waggons or trucks to the top of the furnace directly, lifts of various kinds are employed to raise them. “Water lifts” consist of a pair of chambers or cages working in guides suspended to the two ends of a chain passing over a pulley, and provided with water boxes, so that a stream of water from a tank or reservoir at a higher elevation can be directed into the uppermost waterbox, rendering that heavier than the other, when the weighted cage descends with the empty trucks drawing up the other one with the trucks laden with materials, the rate of descent being regulated by a brake. In frosty weather lifts of this kind are apt to become impracticable. Hydraulic lifts are sometimes used, consisting of a similar chamber suspended from a chain passing over multiplying pulley blocks and attached to the piston of a hydraulic ram, so that when the ram makes a stroke the chain draws up the cage; if. the blocks multiply tenfold a stroke of 7 feet of the ram draws up the cage 70 feet. At the Bethlehem Works, U.S., an hydraulic hoist is employed in which the relatively short stroke of the ram is made to raise the cage through a much greater height by making the ram actuate an axle by means of a rack and pinion, a large wheel being fixed on the axle over which the cage rope passes. Besides these lifts, an inclined plane and stationary engine, or a vertical lift like a colliery winding engine, is sometimes employed. Pneumatic lifts of various kinds are also in use, one consisting of a tall bell immersed in a water tank like an exaggerated thin gasometer; the bell is attached to the cage (underneath it) and also to a chain passing over a pulley to a counterpoise, the weight being so arranged that the bell, when not containing air under pressure, together with the cage and empty trolly, is heavier than the counterpoise, and sinks when a valve is opened, so that the internal air pressure becomes atmospheric; whilst on closing the valve and forcing air in, the water inside the bell is partially displaced, and the bell and cage, being relatively lighter, rise like an ordinary gasometer. Gjers’s pneumatic lift is à piston box, such that, the air being exhausted or compressed under the piston which is connected with the cage, a motion up or down as the casé may be is brought about. Fig. 14, taken from a paper by Gjers.in the Journal Iron and Steel Institute, 1871, ii. 209, illustrates the mode of action; the cylinder is about 36 inches diameter, the piston being connected with the travelling platform (through the centre of which the cylinder passes freely) by four wire ropes passing over pulleys overhead; the platform runs along guides bolted to the cylinder. The platform and empty barrows being at the top, air at about 2 lb pressure per square inch is forced into the cylinder underneath the piston, which suffices to make it ascend, and consequently to cause the table to descend; when barrows full of mine, coke, &c., are wheeled on to the platform, the air is sucked out from underneath the piston so as to make a vacuum of about 4 lb {i.e., the pressure is reduced from 14 to 10 tt> per square inch) with heavy loads, and proportionately less with lighter ones, when the atmospheric pressure now forces the piston down and draws the cage up. The strain on the ropes is thus diminished, whilst the objection to water lifts of being unworkable in frosty .weather is entirely done away with. For heavier weights two larger cylinders are employed, working conjointly with the cage or platform between them.

14. Production of Blast.— The earliest blowing machines were made of goats’ skins, inflated by hand by pulling cords, and compressed either by standing on them or by a weight or a bent bamboo acting as a spring, &c.; such rude arrangements are still in use amongst certain Eastern nations; a kind of rudimentary cylinder blowing machine is also employed iu certain districts, consisting of a hollowed log with a piston packed with feathers, leaves, &c. About the middle of the 17 th century the trompe appears to have been first invented, probably in Italy. The action of this arrangement depends on the suction of air into a stream of falling water running from a tank by an orifice not too far from the surface of the water, just as occurs on pulling out the plug of an ordinary lavatory basin so as to discharge the water therein; the air carried down by the water is discharged into a chamber withan outlet at bottom for the water and one at top for the air, so that as long as the stream of water is kept up a continuous air current passes out of the air hole, the force of which is regulated by a plug-valve attached to a lever and cord, so that the furnaceman can at will diminish or increase the amount of falling water. In practice the trompe only utilizes a small fraction of the power of the descending water. It is of course inapplicable in cold climates during frost; a serious disadvantage too is the fact that much fine spray accompanies the blast and interferes with the production of heat thereby. With a fall of 20 to 30 feet a well-proportioned trompe will deliver a sufficient air supply for a Catalan forge at a pressure of about 9 or 10 centimetres of mercury (about ∣ atmosphere = nearly 2 lb per square inch).
[9:13:302]

The blowing engines in ordinary use in England are worked by steam, but in other countries, e.g., Sweden, where water-power is available, this is frequently utilized. In principle cylinder blowing machines are precisely like inverted steam engines, the air taking the place of the steam; the singleacting machines are the reciprocal analogues of the atmospheric engine (saving of course in the means by which the return stroke is effected), whilst the double-acting machines are high-pressure steam engines inverted. In clack valve machines the motion of the piston in one direction causes a diminished pressure behind it, and consequently air rushes in through the intake valve at that end, whilst the compression of the air in front of it opens the outlet valve of the other end and causes the air to escape; on the return motion this outlet valve is closed and the intake valve of the same end opened, whilst the intake valve of the other end is closed and the outlet valve opened. In “slide valve” machines the moving clack valves are replaced by sliders connected with the piston rod by means of an eccentric on the shaft driving it, so that, when the piston begins to make its stroke, the appropriate valves are closed or unclosed as the case may be. In order to equalize the intermittent blast thus produced, a regulator is sometimes interposed between the blowing cylinder and the furnace, consisting of a reservoir or chamber of considerable size which acts in much the same way as the air chamber of an ordinary force pump, the whole mass of air becoming somewhat compressed when air is blown in, and the expansion during the momentary cessation of the supply keeping up a sufficiently equable stream qf air issuing from the reservoir until the next cylinderful of air is blown in. To economize space, a piston box with a piston loaded with weights, or a loaded gasometer in a water tank, may be substituted for the reservoir; the latter expedient is objectionable, causing the air to be saturated with moisture. If the furnace is at some distance from the blowing engine, the large mass of air in the blast main and superheaters serves to render uniform the current supplied to the furnace without any other regulator being requisite.

15. Hotblast Stoves.— The oldest form of blast heating apparatus, applied by Neilson, consisted of a tubular rivetted boiler plate heating vessel (Λ, h, fig. 15), mounted in a brick chamber OOOO, and heated by a fire underneath fed through the door D, the waste gases from the fire passing out at the far end to the chimney. Crescentshaped partitions p i ρ, p inside the heater caused the current of air from the blowing engine which entered at B to take a serpentine course as indicated by the arrows, finally passing off at S to the furnace. This was speedily superseded by the “Calder pipe stove” (fig.

16), consisting of two parallel tubes L, L running along the base of the stove above the firebars d, d, communicating the one with the other by a series of inverted U or horse-shoe shaped tubes; the blast being introduced into the cold [9:13:303] main Bδ, the air passes over into the hot main S through the curved tubes A, h, becoming heated in so doing, the flames from the fire D<7 enveloping the horse-shoe tubes and then passing by the flue f to the chimney C. Many modifications of this stove hâve been introduced, several of which are still in use: thus in some the air is compelled to pass alternately from a portion of the one main to the other and vice versa several times so as to be more completely heated, passing through several horse-shoes before emerging; the horse-shoes are sometimes altered into inverted V’s, and made rectangular or flatly elliptical in section instead of circular so as to expose greater heating surface. To avoid the liability to fracture through unequal expansion, the U’s are sometimes made of two parallel vertical tubes united by a horizontal connecting tube socketed into each, just as each vertical tube is socketed into the main (fig. 17). The “pistol pipe” stove, still largely used (fig. 18), chiefly differs from this in having the limbs of the U tube closely adjacent, so as to consist in fact of a single tube with a partition D in the centre, the cold air passing up one side of the partition and down the other so as to become heated in passing; to accommodate the pipe to an arched roof, the upper end is bent inwards, thus giving the form of a pistol stock and barrel to the double pipe, two ranks of pipes facing one another being built in the same stove. Another modification of the older tubular superheater consisted of a serpentine or coil of piping made of cast iron pipes bent into half circles and socketed together, so as to form a continuous worm tube which was mounted inside a brickwork stove and heated by a fire in much the same way as the Calder pipe stove. The “Wasseralfingen superheater” consists of a kind of serpentine of which the curved parts lie outside the stove, only straight tubes being exposed to heat. The “Blaina oven” differs from this chiefly in the serpentine being vertical instead of horizontal, and in the whole of the serpentine (the curved ends inclusive) being exposed to the heating flame.

The substitution of the waste gases from the blast furnaces as fuel for the coal or coke-fired, fireplaces originally used for these and various other forms of superheater not only works advantageously in saving the fuel that would otherwise be requisite, but also keeps up a more regular heating effect, and diminishes the liability to breakage through unequal expansion, &c. All these forms of superheater, however, are open to the same objection, viz., that it is impracticable to heat the blast continuously by means of them to a higher temperature than about 450° C., otherwise the iron pipes get speedily burnt away. In order to obtain a higher temperature, the principle of the Siemens regenerative furnace is employedin the Siemens-Cowper stove, the flame from the combustion of the waste gases from the blast furnaces being made to traverse piles or stacks of brickwork loosely heaped together or regularly laid so as to heat up the brickwork, the products of combustion finally passing, off to the chimney at a comparatively low temperature. After the lapse of a certain time the flame is shut off, and the cold air blast made to traverse the heated brickwork in the reverse direction, entering at the cooler chimney end, and leaving at the hottest point near where the furnace gases and the air to burn them originally entered; two such regenerators are used together alternately, thé flame heating up one whilst the blast is being heated in the other, and vice versa, the shifting of the blast and furnace gases from the one to the other being accomplished by opening and shutting suitable valves. Owing to the presence of dust in the blast furnace gases, the cavities between the piled bricks are apt to become filled up with deposit; to remedy this inconvenience in the “Whitwell stove” the piles of brickwork are replaced by a series of parallel firebrick walls about 9 inches apart, each wall being perforated by arched openings at the top and bottom respectively in each alternate wall, so that the flame passes alternately up and down between each wall and the adjacent one, thus heating up the surfaces of the walls (figs. 19, 20). By means of manholes at the top and sides scrapers can be introduced from time to time, and the deposit of flue dust scraped off the walls and removed from the stove without rendering it necessary to take down the internal brickwork at all. With regenerative stoves of this description worked in pairs it is easy to obtain a continuous blast at a temperature of 75(Γ , to 800° C.

Determination of Temperature of Blast.— A rough and ready method often employed is to take out a plug from the blast main, or “gooseneck,” supplying the tuyere, and to hold in the issuing stream of hot air a rod of zinc or other test metal for a determinate time, noting how long it takes to melt its end. More accurate methods consist in the use of specially constructed pyrometers. Certain forms containing a compound silver and platinum spiral, working on much the same principle as that of Breguet’s thermometer, and others in which the expansion of a bar of metal moves an index by means of multiplying wheels or levers, although useful for comparatively low temperatures (below 500° C.), are out of the question for intensely heated blasts; in such cases two forms of pyrometer invented by Siemens are applicable. One of these is an adaptation of the method employed by Pouillet for determining [9:13:304] high temperatures, consisting of a calorimeter into which a heated ball of platinum is dropped; the rise in temperature of the waterbeing noted, the amount of heat lost by the platinum, and consequently its initial temperature, is known. The calorimeter in

Siemens’s instrument (fig. 21) is a copper cylinder jacketed outside with a double jacket, the inner portion of which is an air space and the outer a concentric laver of hair so as to diminish errors due to radiation and atmospheric action; this is provided with a thermometer, the bulb of which is protected by a copper gauze covering, fixed in a groove in the wall of the innermost vessel; a sliding scale is attached, so constructed as to indicate at sight the temperature of the ball dropped in when the zero of the scale is adjusted to the temperature of the calorimeter before starting as indicated by the height of the thermometric mercurial column, and the level of the mercury subsequently reàd off on the scale in that position after the ball has been dropped in,—the size of the ball and the quantity of water in the instrument being duly proportioned to one another. The “ball” is a cylinder of copper with a perforation in the axjs, so that it can be lifted up on a pointed rod and introduced through a small opening into the blast main, &c., to be examined; after a few minutes, when the ball has attained to the temperature of the blast, it is quickly withdrawn and dropped into the copper-calorimeter previously filled up to a mark with water, which is well stirred up before setting the movable scale and subsequently after the ball is dropped in, so as to equalize the temperature. Usually the calorimeter holds a pint of water, the copper being of such a weight that its thermal capacity is equal to - 5 ⅛ of a pint of water. With an instrument that has been “calibrated” (i.e., the error of each scale indication determined by previous experiments at accurately measured temperatures), the writer’s experience is that very concordant and accurate results may be obtained by an expert operator working in precisely the same way as that employed in the calibration of the instrument, but that very considerable errors are apt to be introduced if the instruments as sold are employed without such corrections being made, and if the times which elapse during the withdrawal of the heated ball from the blast main and its dropping into the water are at all unequal, so that different amounts of heat are lost by atmospheric cooling before the ball reaches the water. Moreover, with use the balls become lighter, and the temperature indicated is then too low.

The other Siemens pyrometer depends on the alteration of the dectrical resistance of a platinum wire when heated. The current from a suitable battery is divided into two branches, one of which passes through the experimental wire and the other through a counterbalancing resistance consisting of another wire which is not heated, the two branches again meeting in one conducting wire which completes the circuit. If the two counterbalancing wires are at the same temperature, equal amounts of current will flow through each branch, the resistance of the conductors, &c., in each branch other than the two wires being equal; but if one wire be hotter, less current will . flow through that branch as compared with the other in proportion as the temperature is more elevated. By determining electrically the difference between the amounts of current in the two branches, a means is afforded of calculating the temperature to which the hotter wire has been raised. In the newest form of instrument (fig. 22) a pair of ingeniously constructed voltameters is employed as the current-difference measurer, one being in each branch of the compound circuit, so that by reading off the volumes of gas evolved in the two, and referring to specially constructed tables, the temperature of the heated wire is at once known. In order to apply this to the measurement of the temperature of blast mains, furnaces, &c., the wire to be heated is wound spirally upon a porcelain cylinder, which is then enclosed in a protecting iron tube; the ends of the platinum wire are connected with thick copper leading wires insulated by kaolin, &c.,atthe hot part of the tube, and by ordinary gutta percha, &c., at the other end. An equal amount of the same copper-wire is included in the second branch, usually by carrying three wires through the hollow iron tube,—one to convey the current before branching (the division taking place near the heated end), the other to convey the current through the branch containing the heated wire, and the third for the current in the other branch to t>ass through; in this way errors through the unequal length and mating of the copper conductors in the two branches are avoided. Very accurate measurements are obtainable with instruments of this class when newly arranged; but it is not always certain that the resistance of a given platinum wire will remain constant after long-continued heating or interrupted exposure to high temperatures, &c.; in consequence it is requisite that the actual resistance after cooling of the heated wire should be verified from time to time, and the numerical values in the instrumental tables suitably adjusted when any alteration has taken place, otherwise serious errors may be introduced.

For temperatures above 800° or 900° C. a peculiar pyrometer has been proposed by Lamy {Comptes Rendus, lxix. 347), based upon the connexion between the amount of dissociation of calcium carbonate and the pressure and temperature to which it is subjected; a glazed porcelain tube closed at one end with some fragments of marble and calcspar is filled with carbon dioxide gas and connected with a mercurial manometer; on placing the end of the tube containing the calcspar on the furnace to be examined, the extra pressure due to the evolved carbon dioxide is read off on the manometer, and the temperature thence deduced by a table; on cooling, the evolved gas is reabsorbed by the partially causticized lime.

Tuyeres.— The heated blast passes into the furnace through nozzles or tuyeres supplied from an annular or horseshoe shaped tube carried round the lower part of the furnace at an elevation of a few feet above them by means of slanting tubes at right angles to the ring known as “swan necks” or “goosenecks.” Usually the annular tube is carried by the columns supporting the superstructure by means of suitable braces or gibbets, and communicates with the blast main at a point as near to the superheater as possible, slide valves being provided for each goose neck so that any one of the tuyeres can, when necessary, be shut off without stopping the supply of blast to the others; when more than one furnace is supplied from the same hot main, a similar valve is provided in the branch from the main leading to each furnace. In order to adjust the nozzle of the tuyere accurately to the tuyere hole in the hearth wall, a sliding telescope joint is often inserted between the nozzle and the end of the goose neck, the lowest portion of the nearly vertical part of which is provided with a tubulus closed with a hollow stopper, the hollow of which is covered with a plate of mica; by looking through [9:13:305] the mica along the axis of the nozzle a view of the furnace interior is obtained, whilst by removing the stopper a jet of hot blast rushes out, by means of which the temperature can be ascertained by holding rods of zinc, &c., in the jet; or the ball of a Siemens pyrometer can be introduced into the tuyere through the orifice.

In the early days of the hot blast it speedily became manifest that unless the tuyere nozzles were artificially cooled they became so rapidly eaten away that practically the hot blast was inapplicable; to remedy this the “water tuyere” was invented by Condie. This simply consists of a nozzle with double walls, the outer one forming a “jacket” round the inner one or nozzle proper, water being allowed to circulate through the space between the walls. Another way of effecting the cooling is by bending a coil of wrought iron piping into a conical spiral (fig. 23), placing this in the cavity of a mould furnished with a core, and casting round it a hollow cone of cast iron, so that by connecting the projecting ends of the coil with a water main and escape pipe respectively a continual circulation of water is kept up through the coil, whilst the blast passes through the central cavity. Sometimes bronze and especially “phosphor-bronze” nozzles are employed; these have the advantage that the molten pig iron as it runs down inside the furnace does not adhere to them so readily as it does to iron tuyeres. The tuyeres are generally arranged symmetrically in a horizontal plane round the base of the furnace, this effects an equal distribution of blast, an∣ facilitates regular working. With small-sized furnace such as are used in various parts of the Continent (witl charcoal as fuel), two tuyeres only are ire quently used; with larger ones three, four or five are usually employed, the diamete of the orifice of the nozzle being greater th greater the furnace; thus whilst some: inches diameter suffices with the smalle furnaces, 4, 5, 6, and even 8 inch nozzles ar ) used with the larger furnaces, especially iι America (e.g., at Pittsburg), and when th number of tuyeres is small. In other case a larger number of tuyeres, sometimes a many as eight, are substituted for increase« dimensions, so as to enable the requisit amount of air to pass into the furnace with out unduly increasing the pressure of th blast, which varies from 2 to 50 percent of an atmosphere (fe., from about half aι inch to 15 inches of mercury, representing from 4 oz. to 7⅜ ft per square inch), th lightest pressure being employed in smal charcoal furnaces, and the heaviest in th English hard coke large furnaces and th American anthracite furnaces, especially th· latter, on account of the tendency of tin anthracite to disintegrate and so plug up th< passages between the lumps of ore, &c. Th∣ pressure of the blast in ordinary 1arg< English furnaces, such as those of the Cleve land district, usually averages about 4 t( 4 ’ 5 ft per square inch, equivalent to abou one-third of an atmosphere, or some 10 inche! of mercury.

When the nozzle of a tuyere gets injured oι burnt through, the water intended to keep it coo is apt to find its way into the furnace. As long as the quantity of water thus introduced is small, the only effect is a reduction of temperature opposite to the tuyere owing to the heat absorption in the conversion of th« water into steam and the reaction of the water vapour on the red hot coke, forming carbon oxide and hydrogen (the presence of extra hydrogen thus formed also modifies to some extent the chemical actions taking place in the upper part of the furnace in a direction rather the reverse of economical as regards consumption of fuel); if, on the other hand, a large volume of water is suddenly introduced, and especially if by a “slip” (or sudden jerky motion downwards of a mass of material that had previously more or less ‘ ‘ scaffolded ”) it is forced into the mass of molten cinder and pig in the hearth, or, what amounts to the same thing, it the cinder and molten pig are suddenly forced or splashed up by the slip, a sudden explosive generation of steam (and probably decomposition into oxygen and hydrogen, or formation of iron oxide and free hydrogen) takes place, sometimes giving rise to serious accidents. Why contact with vitreous matter (such as cinder, &c.) should cause a more explosive formation of water vapour or gases than contact with metal is unknown, but probably the cause is the same as that in virtue of which a piece of sodium in contact with λvater only will evolve hydrogen quickly but not explosively, whereas if the sodium touch glass, glazed crockery, &c., and water simultaneously, a violent explosion often occurs. In foundries and during the refining of iron (§ 23), if water be thrown on the surface of the molten or semi-fused metal, and a piece of solid cinder or slag be mechanically carried under the surface of the hot metal, a more or less loud explosion often occurs, sometimes sufficiently violent to produce fatal consequences and do much damage (Menelaus); on the other hand, in cold blast furnaces where water tuyeres are not used, explosions of this class never happen, although in all kinds of furnaces explosions may occur due to admixtures of air and blast furnace gases being formed when the blast is cut off for tapping, &c., and then being fired on putting on the blast again. This class of accident is usually guarded against as far as possible by means of appropriately constructed valves in the gas main, &c. Sudden violent mechanical squirting out of molten pig or cinder by a slip inside the furnace sometimes occurs with serious consequences; but this is a different thing from (though often combined with) the effect of water being carried suddenly into contact with the cinder, [9:13:306] lac. In order to diminish the liability to explosions from this effect of water, Lloyd has patented a peculiar tuyere into which the cooling water is injected in the form of spray or fine jets all over the outer surface of an inner conical tube through which the hot air passes, as well as over the inner surface of an outer covering cone, so that in case of the end of the tuyere being burnt away the volume of water injected into the furnace is much lessened, as owing to the incline backwards of the lowest part of the cone (the axis being horizontal) most of the water runs out away from the furnace instead of being forced into it by the pressure of the head of water as in the ordinary coil tuyere. When the water supplied is muddy, or is apt to deposit matter on warming or standing, there is a liability to stopping up of the holes through which the fine jets of water pass; to rémedy this Plum modifies the aιτangement by making the water pass through a slit or against a sheet of metal so as to spread it out into fan-shaped jets delivered against the nose of the tuyere and the upper half of the outer shell. For drawings of this “spreader tuyere,” see Journal I. and S. Inst., 1878, 299.^[18. A large amount of detailed information as to the dimensions and construction and general working of the blast furnaces and subsidiary plant of a number of the more important American iron-works is to be found in a series of papers on “American Iron and Steel Works,” by A. L. Holley and Lenox Smith, Engineering, 1877, &c. ]

16. Collection of Cinder and Pig Iron.— As the cinderflows off from the furnace it is usually received in rectangular or cylindrical iron tanks mounted on wheels and running on a railway at a few feet lower level than the base of the furnace; the cinder balls thus formed are usually discharged on to some vacant piece of ground in the vicinity of the furnace, thus entailing the loss of the value of the ground.^[19. In the vicinity of Middlesborough they have for some time been largely disposed of by using them to build a retaining wall to keep the sea back from low-lying ground and mud banks covered at high water to a greater or lesser extent, whereby not only is a valueless waste product got rid off, but a recovery of what may hereafter prove to be valuable land from the sea is effected. ] The Kloman machine used in America for the reception of the cinder consists of a series of iron boxes placed in a water tank on a turn-table, the object being to quicken the solidification of the cinder and get it out of the way more rapidly. In order to cast the pig iron into convenient marketable forms, the ground in front of the tapping hole is made into a pigbed, by arranging it at a gentle slope from the tapping hole and covering it with loam or sand. A channel is dug in this with a spade, <fcc., leading down the slope in a right line from the tapping hole; and at right angles to this side channels are dug, the ground sloping laterally away from the main channel; from each side channel moulds are made to spring, prepared by pressing into the yielding sand wooden blocks some 2 or 3 feet in length, and in section like a capital D, the convex side (on which is embossed or engraved the particular mark or brand of the iron-works) being downwards. When the furnace is tapped the rivulet of molten metal running down the main channel is first directed into the lowest row of moulds, and when these are full the supply is shut off by plunging a spade coated with fireclay into the channel at a (fig. 24), so as to fill up the second row of moulds, and so on successively until only cinder flows out at the tapping hole. Whilst the castings are still at a dull red heat and the metal is consequently brittle, the pigs or masses of metal filling the moulds are detached from the sows, or irregular larger pigs from the channels, by means of a crowbar. In some works the tapping is performed only once in twelve hours; in others a cast is made every eight hours or even more frequently; of course the oftener the furnace is tapped the less the size of the pigbed required. Occasionally the molten metal is run into waggons lined with firebrick serving as reservoirs supplying with fused pig Bessemer converters conjoined with the smelting furnaces; so that the molten cast iron is run directly into the converters and finished off without ever solidifying before the completion of the steel-making process. Sometimes the metal is cast into pigs in iron moulds instead of a sand bed.

Composition of Pig Iron.— The following analyses illustrate the difference in composition of various kinds of pig iron as met with in the market :—
[table]
[table]

Composition of Cinder.— Sometimes cinder is highly crystalline; that from clay ironstone, especially of the Cleveland district, however, is usually amorphous; the structure in all cases depends much upon the rate of cooling, a cinder which is distinctly crystalline when a large mass is cooled slowly being often vitreous and wholly devoid of crystalline texture when cooled quickly in
[table]

small quantities at a time. Presence of much lime makes the cinder chalky or stony in appearance; ferrous oxide communicates a dark green or black tint and a ready fusibility to it; manganese oxide often gives an amethystine shade. Ultramarine appears to be sometimes formed, some slags possessing a blue colour easily discharged by mineral acids; the blue tint is, however, attributed by [9:13:307] some to different causes, such as compounds of vanadium and titanium. When, in addition to the “mine” or ordinary ores, the substances smelted contain an admixture of the slags from puddling and reheating furnaces, or of “mill cinder” (scales from the rolling mills used in the production of malleable iron), the blast furnace cinder is apt to contain an undue proportion of iron, these additional substances being usually much more compact in their texture than ores, and at the same time more fusible, so that their complete reduction is often not effected in the time during which they are traversing the furnace. Since these slags are usually highly contaminated with phosphorus and sulphur, they are only employed as a rule in conjunction with ores yielding the commoner qualities of iron, furnishing “cinder pig,” which is often wholly white, and less carbonized and more impure than other kinds ot white iron. The accompanying analyses illustrate the composition of the cinder produced in furnaces smelting various kinds of ore.

17. Utilization of Cinder.— When the cinder does not contain too much lime or calcium sulphide, it often forms a material of moderate hardness and durability suitable for road metal; but frequently it is of but little value for this purpose, owing to its friability and tendency to fall to pieces on exposure to air and moisture. By casting the molten cinder (when of the requisite amount of durability) into rectangular blocks, a good substitute for building stone is produced; in other cases, by the addition of alkaline silicates, a serviceable coarse bottle glass can be obtained. Vitreous cinders also serve for the preparation of a variety of “mineral wool,” a filamentous substance something like spun glass producible by blowing air or steam through the molten cinder, and useful for packing the jackets of steam pipes, boilers, &c., to avoid loss of heat, and superior for this purpose to organic substances in being not liable to char or burn. Certain kinds of cinder which approximate to cements in composition may be utilized in the manufacture of hydraulic mortars, Portland cement, &c., by heating together with lime or hydraulic limestone; according to J. Huck, if the powdered slag be stirred up in a tank with dilute hydrochloric acid (containing some 17 per cent, of actual acid, HC1), sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved, and a partly gelatinized mass is produced by the decomposition of the silicates; this when washed, drained, dried, and ground to fine powder, and mixed with finely powdered ordinary slag so as to constitute about 10 per cent, of the mixture, affords a cement capable of use for all sorts of work as well under water as above it, and equal in quality to the best cements in ordinary use. Bricks for building purposes may be made from suitable kinds of cinder by grinding it to a coarse powder, moistening and mixing with a little lime, and strongly compressing in moulds by machinery; the brick sets in a few days to a hard stone-like mass; some cinders will thus set without addition of lime by merely grinding up fine, moistening, and compressing. In order to facilitate the grinding, C. Wood has patented the following process: the molten slag as it runs from the furnace is received on a slowly revolving horizontal table and cooled by a jet of water (fig. 25), which causes it to disintegrate into comparatively small fragments which are much'more readily pulverized than the compact blocks formed when the molten slag runs into a receptacle and there solidifies; or it is reduced to a kind of sand by running it into water kept in agitation by a peculiar machine, the sand being a moderately useful manure for certain ’soils, Journal I. and S. Inst., 1873, 186, and 1877, 443; and Journal Soc. Arts, May 14, 1880 (vol. xxviii. p. 576). At the Sclessin Works, Liège, slag sand is made without any machinery at all by simply making the stream of molten slag run into a constant-running jet of water issuing obliquely from behind; the slag thus disintegrates spontaneously into small fragments. Many kinds of cinder, however, are of so little value for any of these purposes that they constitute a wholly waste product, the getting rid of which in the cheapest way possible is a desideratum.

18. Collection of Waste Gases.— To M. Aubertot of the department of Cher belongs the credit of having first attempted to utilize the gases escaping from blast furnaces, in 1811; a brick kiln being erected on the top of the furnace, the flame was allowed to pass in and so burn the bricks; the calcination of lime and the heating of the chests containing charcoal and iron bars for steel cementation was effected by him in the same way. In later years steam boilers were heated in much the same way; about 1840, at the Rustrel furnaces (department of Vaucluse), the device was in use of drawing off the gases by means of a tube and burning them underneath the boilers placed, not on the top of the furnace, but in any convenient place even though at some distance. The use of the waste gases for heating the blast on this principle was patented in England by J. Palmer Budd in 1845. A few years later George Parry of Ebbw Vale adapted an old arrangement for distributing equally the charges introduced into the furnace (by shooting the materials on to a conical surface at the mouth of the shaft) so as to form a kind of valve, closing the furnace entirely when shut and allowing the gases to pass out completely into a tube conveying them to the places where they were to be burnt, and at the same time allowing the charge to be introduced almost instantaneously when opened. This “cup and cone” arrangement is represented in fig. 26.

By simply lowering the cone (counterbalanced) the materials shoot off it into the furnace; by immediately raising it the furnace is again closed; on account of its simplicity and ease in working it has been very largely adopted, especially as it facilitates the proper distribution of materials inside the furnace by making them glide off the slanting conical surface so as to be deposited at the sides of the shaft and not at its centre; the effect of this is to tend to make the upper surface of the mass concave instead of convex, and in consequence the lighter coke or charcoal tends to roll down the slope towards the centre somewhat more than the heavier ore and flux, so that the central portion of the mass of materials in the shaft is somewhat richer in fuel than the sides; if the furnace is full nearly to the throat and of considerable width, the surface will be crater-shaped,—the heavier ore, &c., accumulating in the circular crater ridge, and the lighter coke rolling down inwards towards the centre, and outwards towards the side of the shaft. As the materials sink the outermost layers are retarded by friction against the sides [9:13:308] of the shaft, so that they have a tendency to fall over inwards during descent and produce intermixture; in this way a much more nearly uniform degree of porosity of the whole mass (and consequently of action of the ascending gases) is brought about than would be the case were the materials introduced through a narrow funnel so as to forai a convex-surfaced heap in which the ore would accumulate in the centre. Sometimes the cup and cone arrange-- ment is modified by making the cone to rest upon the inner and lower edge of the hollow in the cup, so that the introduction of fuel is accomplished by raising the cone instead of lowering it, the object of this being to diminish the height of the furnace by the space through which the cone would otherwise sink when lowered.

With this arrangement the materi ils run into the furnace in a direction sloping towards the centre instead of away from it, sliding inwards along the converging sides of the cup. To avoid the central accumulation of fuel and the lateral preponderance of “burden” (ore and flux) thus promoted, an inverted annular funnel is suspended underneath the lower orifice of the cup, so that the falling substances impinge upon this and slide off again with a motion towards the circumference of the shaft just as they do from the cone itself in the ordinary arrangement.

Prior to the introduction of the cup and cone, a form of tunnelhead in which no valve or cone exists was employed, represented in fig. 27. A hollow annular chamber BB is built in the upper portion of the stack, communicating by arched cavities A, A, A with the shaft, and also with the exit gas main C; a considerable fraction of the gases then passes out through the arched cavities when the materials are heaped up to the level of the charging door D. With small furnaces the wall between the shaft and the chamber B is made of cast or wrought iron; in some cases the gas has been collected through a central tube in the axis of the shaft supported by groins springing from the shaft, the ore, &c., being charged through the annular opening between this tube and the shaft. Arrangements of this kind are still used in Sweden. In Coingt’s gas collector the central tube is combined with a modification of the cup and cone arrangement. Langen’s arrangement (figs. 28, 29) is a somewhat similar combination, the cone being made into a bell with perforated top, the edges of the perforation being turned over inwards bb ; the bell rests upon the cup aa, the turned over edge cc fitting into a water lute surrounding the central tube kkk, so that whilst the bell is lowered the furnace top is gastight or nearly so. By means of a pair of levers d, d and a counterpoise swung on a horizontal axle at r by means of a winch e, the bell can be raised so that the charge in the cup falls into the furnace, sliding down the inclined surface. Two safety valves x and fg are provided, the latter being ordinarily supported by the pressure of the gases, but falling by its own weight when the gas pressure is relieved by raising the bell, so as to close the top of the gas shaft, the turned-down edges of g fitting into the annular groove oo; h is a small manhole for the introduction of scrapers to clear out flue dust when required.

Composition of Waste Gases.— In general terms the escaping gases may be said to be the nitrogen of the blast mixed with variable proportions of carbon oxide and dioxide, and usually small quantities of free hydrogen; when raw coal is the fuel, the proportion of hydrogen is greater, and carburetted hydrogens are also present. The main sources of hydrogen when coke and charcoal are used as fuel are probably the hydrogenous matter in the fuel, and the moisture contained in the blast and in the materials as water of hydration not expelled until they reach a part of the furnace sufficiently high to cause the water vapour to react whilst still nascent on the carbon present, forming carbon oxide and hydrogen (see § 10).

Various solid substances are mechanically carried up with the gases, these having in many instances been vaporized at the lower levels, condensing again in the relatively cooler portions of the furnace as finely divided particles. This especially applies to zinc oxide (formed by the oxidation of zinc vapour generated by the reduction of zinc compounds in the ores) and to compounds of the alkali metals, and gives rise in the latter case to a destructive fluxing action upon the brick-work of the upper portion of the furnace and to a complication in the chemical changes ensuing in the furnace; for the solid floating particles are more or less intercepted and filtered out, as it were, from the ascending stream of gases by the materials in the upper part of the furnace, and are thus brought back again to the lower level, so that an accumulation in the furnace of alkali metals is produced which ultimately causes the actual quantity of alkaline compounds in the furnace to bear a very considerable proportion to the iron present, although the amount of potash and soda in the ore flux and fluel is originally only trifling as compared with the iron. Those portions of the suspended solid matters which are not thus retained in the furnace by condensation on the materials are more or less deposited in the gas flues, and the heating stoves, &c., in which the gas is burnt, sometimes causing considerable inconvenience, and rendering it necessary to clean out the deposits from time to time. To avoid this clogging, the fume is sometimes washed out of the gases by jets of water in the form of spray before they pass on from the downcast pipe to the stoves; an arrangement of this description applied to the Lucy furnace (Pittsburg, U. S. ) has worked well. The following analyses represent the composition of the fume deposited in the gas flues of various furnaces :—
[table]
[9:13:309]

Amongst the alkaline salts thus deposited are considerable amounts (under certain circumstances) of potassium and sodium cyanides (§ 19); this circumstance appears to have misled Professors Bunsen and Playfair into the belief that cyanogen gas is occasionally one of the normal constituents of blast furnace gases as they escape at the top, the cyanides being more or less deposited in the collecting tube employed, and decomposed by the carbon dioxide and moisture present, with the production of hydrocyanic vapour, which on . analysis gives the same numbers as the same bulk of a mixture of hydrogen and cyanogen in equal volumes; it is noteworthy that cyanogen has never been found by any other analyst. The following analyses indicate the general character of the waste gases escaping at the top of blast furnaces smelting various ores:—

5. Average of a number of analyses of gas from an 80 foot furnace using calcined Cleveland ore, limestone, and hard coke: blast at 485° (average), and exit gases at 332° C.

6. Coltness furnace using raw coal.

The precise relative amounts of carbon oxide and dioxide that accompany the proper working of any particular furnace are governed by a variety of circumstances, many of which have been carefully investigated by Percy, Bunsen and Playfair, Vathaire, Tiinner, Ebelmen, Scheerer, and others, and more especially by Lowthian Bell, with the present writer’s cooperation (Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting), with the general result that the amount of heat produced in the furnace by the conversion of the fuel (coke or charcoal) into carbon oxide and dioxide, together with that introduced by the blast, is equal to the sensible heat carried out by the escaping gases and the molten pig and cinder, together with an amount constant for given conditions, but otherwise variable within certain limits, representing the sum of the heat absorptions during the various physical and chemical changes going on in the furnace, and the loss of heat from the furnace walls by radiation and conduction; so that for given sizes and shapes of furnace, given ores and fluxes, and production or given kinds of pig iron and cinder, the amount of carbon oxide relatively to the carbon dioxide in the escaping gases is regulated only by the proportion of fuel burnt, and the temperature of the issuing gases; this latter being also constant, the greater the amount of coke burnt per ton of iron run the more carbon oxide exists in the waste gases and the less carbon dioxide, and vice versa. There is always a natural limit, however, to the extent to which the quantity of carbon monoxide can be reduced and that of carbon dioxide increased in any given furnace under any given conditions (as to nature of ore, &c.) by diminishing the amount of fuel relatively to the burden; as this limit is being approached and passed, the pig iron begins to deteriorate in quality, first being less graphitoidal or “grey” in character, then becoming entirely white iron of a less carbonized character than good pig of the kind; finally a large fraction of the iron is wholly unreduced, and passes into the cinder as ferrous oxide (silicate), producing a strongly marked “scouring cinder,” and greatly diminishing the yield. The reason for this is simply the natural character of the complex chemical changes and reactions involved in the working of the blast furnace (dealt with in detail in § 19).

Poisonous Effects of Blast-Furnace Gases.— Carbon oxide being, as is well known, a poisonous gas, rapidly producing death when inhaled even in small quantity (as when badly ventilated rooms are warmed by charcoal braziers, &c., or when a considerable escape of coal gas—containing usually a few parts per cent, of carbon oxide—takes place into the air of the room), it results that unless care be taken serious effects may be produced by the inhalation of the waste gases from the blast furnace. Several fatal occurrences due to this cause have taken place, one of the most remarkable of which was the death of Mr Truran, manager of the Dowlais iron-works, through the escape into his office of the gases from the gas main, which was of brickwork, and newly constructed underground. Besides carbon oxide, the waste gases often contain perceptible quantities of potassium cyanide disseminated through them as dust; the effect of moisture and carbon dioxide upon such air is to impregnate it with vapour of hydrocyanic acid (prussic acid); in some of the cases of poisoning by waste gases the cyanide was believed to be the chief deleterious agent.

19. Chemical Changes taking place in the Blast Furnace. —At the level of the tuyeres, the entering blast comes in contact with a mass of incandescent coke through and over which molten cinder and pig iron are dropping and running; the almost instantaneous effect upon the air consequently is to transform the oxygen into carbon oxide either at once or through the two well-known reactions :—

C + O a =CO 2 (1),

CO 2 + C =2Cυ (2).

If a hole be drilled through the walls of a furnace at the tuyere level, and the issuing gases collected (or, what is much the same thing, if the blast be shut off from one goose neck and the plug taken out so that the pressure of gases inside the furnace forces gas out at the orifice),'it is invariably found that the amount of carbon dioxide present in the gases is inconsiderable or nil,— the composition of the gases being essentially a mixture of carbon and ’nitrogen with a little hydrogen (either derived from the moisture in the blast being converted into hydrogen and carbon oxide, or from the hydrogen of the coke first burnt to water vapour and then immediately reconverted into hydrogen and carbon oxide). Besides the carbon oxide due to these causes, there is also a small amount of that gas arising from the molten iron and cinder accumulated in the hearth, owing to the reaction of the dissolved carbon on the last traces of iron oxide disseminated through the pig and dissolved in the cinder; so that at the tuyere level there naturally is a little more oxygen relatively to the nitrogen than that corresponding to the oxygen of the original air and moisture in the blast, viz., a mixture of about 35 volumes of carbon oxide and 65 of nitrogen. In passing through the mass of materials in the furnace, the carbon oxide becomes more or less converted into carbon dioxide, reducing the iron ore in virtue of the change expressed in general terms by the equation zC0 + Ye x 0 ν =zC0 i + Ye x 0 u - 2 . . . . (3); so that, were this the sole action taking place, at successive levels upwards the amount of carbon in the gases would remain constant relatively to the nitrogen, whilst the oxygen therein would increase. The actual changes, however, are far more complex than this. Thus, commencing with the top of the furnace, and proceeding downwards, when raw limestone is used as flux, it gives off carbon dioxide as it gets heated, thereby increasing both carbon and oxygen in the gases; during the passage downwards of the ore in the blast furnace it finds itself continually exposed to a heated atmosphere containing carbon oxide and dioxide; the first effect of the gases upon the newly introduced ore is simply to heat it up, but as soon as the outer portions of the lumps have attained a temperature of something like 200° C. (dependent on the physical character of the ore), which practically is almost immediately after introduction, reduction of the ferric oxide present commences, the carbon oxide of the gases becoming converted into carbon dioxide in accordance with equation 3. Simultaneously, however, the fuel introduced is more or less acted upon: if raw coal be not used, but coke or charcoal, as is most frequently the case, the effect of exposing this to an atmosphere containing carbon dioxide is to cause (when the temperature is sufficiently high) the occurrence of the reaction between the carbon dioxide and the carbon of the fuel expressed by equation 2. The temperature at which this change begins to take place to any considerable extent depends on the physical condition of the carbon, as does also the rate at which it goes o∏j which is also modified by the amount of carbon dioxide present in the gases relatively [9:13:310] to the other constituents; the reaction is not sensible with hard coke at temperatures lower than 300°, whilst at 400° and somewhat upwards it is not marked; at 500° and 600°, however, it goes on pretty rapidly, the more so the less hard and dense the coke, charcoal acting much more readily under similar conditions than, coke. Accordingly as the iron ore and the fuel gradually sink in the furnace and become hotter, they tend to affect the composition of the gas in opposite ways, the former decreasing the carbon oxide and increasing the carbon dioxide, and vice versa with the latter. The rate of reduction of iron oxide under constant circumstances is, however, a diminishing one, inasmuch as the reduced particles cover up the unreduced ones and prevent their being so readily acted on; so that, whilst on descending into a hotter region the rate of reduction of the ore is at first increased owing to increase of temperature, by and by the rate of removal of oxygen as it sinks ceases to increase and ultimately diminishes. Long before anything like complete reduction is brought about, however, other changes are brought into play which greatly modify the actions. As soon as the iron ore is partially reduced, it begins to react on the carbon oxide in the way indicated by the equation

Fe x O i , +CO = C+ Fe x O⅛+ι ..... (4), setting free finely divided amorphous carbon in contact with it.^[20. According to Griiner (Comptes Rendus, 1871, 28) this reaction is 3FeO + CO = C + F eO^, and does not commence until the iron ore is deoxidized to some considerable extent, at least on the outer surface of the lumps of ore. ] Again, as soon as metallic iron in a spongy form is produced, it reacts on the carbon dioxide, thus—

αFe + 2∕CO 2 =∙Fe x O i , + 2∕CO (5); whilst very probably a parallel reaction takes place with lower oxides of iron not completely reduced to the metallic state, these actions being practically reciprocal to those in virtue of which carbon oxide reduces to ferric oxide, first to a lower oxide and then to metal. Yet again, when carbon and iron oxides are heated together, there takes place a dhange virtually reciprocal to that in virtue of which carbon is deposited from carbon oxide (equation 4),—carbon oxide and dioxide gases being formed, and the iron oxide being more or less reduced in virtue of the reactions

C + Fe x O i ,= CO+Fe x O i ,.ι (6),

C + 2F x O i ,=CO 2 + 2Fe x O y -ι (7).

The ultimate result then is that before the ore and fuel have descended far they are subjected to a number of opposing forces: so far as the ore is concerned, the carbon oxide in the gases surrounding it and the deposited carbon in contact with it tend to remove oxygen by reactions 3, G, and 7, whilst the carbon dioxide in the gases and the reaction causing deposition of carbon from carbon oxide tend to reoxidize it by reactions 4 and 5: the fuel and carbon oxides in the gases on the other hand are analogously affected; the reaction of the carbon dioxide on the fuel, 2, tends to gasify the latter (the action being more rapid with charcoal than with coke—Lowthian Bell, also Akermann), and that of the carbon oxide on the partly reduced iron ore setting free carbon, 4, to reverse this action. The actions of the iron and its oxide on carbon, and on carbon oxide and dioxide, also are opposed, some tending to increase the carbon oxide, 5 and 6, and some to decrease it, 4, and others to affect similarly the carbon dioxide, viz., 3 and 7 to increase it, and 5 to decrease it. In consequence, at any given level of the furnace a sort of compromise is arrived at amongst all these varied oxidizing and reducing influences, the net or resultant chemical action being that, whilst a portion of the hard coke of the fuel is gasified, and reciprocally a portion of finely divided amorphous carbon precipitated from the gases, the iron is partially but not wholly reduced. On the whole, then, as the ore sinks in the furnace, it becomes hotter and hotter and more and more deoxidized, but owing to the oxidizing influences at work it does not part with all its oxygen until it has descended some considerable distance to a point where the temperature is about sufficient to fuse it; at this stage the last portions of oxygen are removed, partly by the precipitated amorphous carbon, partly by the alkaline cyanides accumulating in the furnace, and the almost completely reduced metal melts, dissolving as much of the amorphous carbon in contact with it as it can take up under the circumstances; simultaneously the silicious and earthy matters present also fuse, forming cinder. The reducing influences at work here also cause the deoxidation of some of the silica present, whilst manganese, phosphorus, and sulphur compounds, &c., are also more or less reduced and taken up by the fusing iron. When the proportion of fuel relatively to the burden is diminished, a larger amount of incompletely deoxidized ore reaches the hearth, the result of which is that, as the silicious and earthy matters fuse, they dissolve some of the iron oxide before it has time to become reduced by the deposited carbon, giving a ferruginous cinder, whilst this carbou is used up in completing the reduction more rapidly than would otherwise be the case; the pig iron formed is less highly carbonized than before, becoming white instead of grey, partly owing to the diminution in the quantity of dissolved carbon, and partly because the temperature of the hearth is lowered, and there is less time for graphite to separate in cooling.

The formation of alkaline cyanides and their reaction on the imperfectly reduced iron oxide is brought about as follows: in the upper part of the furnace a crust of alkaline carbonates, &c., carried up as fume by the escaping gases (§ 18), is deposited on the surface of the materials, and so is brought down again to the hearth, where the nitrogen of the blast and carbon act on it conjointly, forming (for potassium carbonate) potassium cyanide, thus

K 2 CO 3 + N 2 + 4C = 2KCN + 3CO .

The exact nature of the reaction of potassium cyanide on the imperfectly reduced iron oxide with which it finds itself in contact is not known, but it is probable that potassium oxide and iron cyanide are formed, the latter becoming decomposed into iron, carbon, and free nitrogen, and the former being carried away by the escaping gases and deposited as potassium carbonate in the upper part of the furnace, so that where the cyanide is formed (mainly at or near the tuyere level) there is an evolution of carbon oxide and a disappearance of nitrogen, whilst a little higher up there is a reevolution of nitrogen; that is, whilst at the tuyere level and thereabouts the carbon and oxygen in the gases are raised, relatively to the nitrogen, considerably above the amount due simply to the blast becoming transformed into carbon oxide and nitrogen, a little higher up the amounts of carbon and oxygen appear to diminish relatively to the nitrogen; not that they actually do diminish in quantity, but that the evolution of nitrogen from the cyanide decomposition causes their amounts to be lessened relatively to the total nitrogen. Thus the following numbers are calculated from some of Lowthian Bell’s observations with an 80 foot furnace using coke and calcined Cleveland ironstone, the gases being obtained by drilling holes through the furnace wall at the different levels, and collecting the issuing gas; the amount of carbon in the gases is manifestly greater at the tuyere than that due to the blast; for some feet it apparently diminishes owing to the cyanide reaction, and then remains almost constant till near the top, where it increases from the expulsion of carbon dioxide from the flux. The oxygen again is considerably in excess of that due to the blast at the tuyeres, but at a somewhat higher level it apparently decreases, whilst higher up still it increases again owing to the reduction of the ferric oxide and the evolution of carbon dioxide from the limestone.
[table]
[9:13:311]

Precisely similar results are calculable from the analyses of Tiinner, Ebelmen, and others who have examined the composition of the gases at different levels of the blast furnace; the variations in the amounts of carbon and oxygen relatively to the nitrogen at the lower levels in all cases are of such a nature as to indicate that the amount of decomposition of iron cyanide with evolution of nitrogen is very considerable, i.e,, that the reduction of iron oxide by alkaline cyanides takes place to an extent constituting a very considerable fraction indeed of the total amount of reduction.

The amount of alkaline cyanides disseminated through the gases of a furnace at different levels varies inversely with the height above the tuyere; thus, in the course of Lowthian Bell’s experiments, the following analyses were made by the present writer of the substances dissolved by water through which known large volumes of the gases were aspirated, being drawn from the different levels into a large gasometer,—the weights being given in grammes per cubic metre of gas (at 0° and 760 mm.), and the experiments being all made within a short time of one another (all on the same day) :—
[table]

The amounts of alkaline cyanides were found to be considerably variable from day to day when the gases from any given perforation were examined; thus, for example, the following amounts of combined cyanogen were obtained in two other series of observations with the first and last of these perforations :—
[table]

In the furnace examined the quantity of gases at a few feet above the tuyere level per unit weight of pig iron made would be about 6 parts by weight, so that per 100 grammes of pig the gases would weigh about 600 grammes, occupying about 0 ’ 45 cubic metre. When the amount of cyanogen combined as cyanides disseminated through the gases was 20 grammes (equivalent to 50 grammes of potassium cyanide) per cubic metre (a quantity often exceeded), the potassium cyanide per 100 grammes of pig would consequently be about 22 5 grammes, or about ¾ of the weight of the pig iron, and consequently about ⅜×⅜=⅜ roughly of the oxygen in the form of ferric oxide in the ore originally used; hence evidently the influence exerted by the combined cyanogen upon the removal of the last portions of oxygen must have been very considerable indeed, especially as the cyanides that escape in the gases from the hearth probably represent considerably less than the total amount generated there, a considerable proportion being used up in deoxidizing the iron oxide pari passu with its formation. That this is so has indeed been urged long ago by Bunsen and Playfair, who found that the gases drawn from a perforation 2 feet 9 inches above the tuyere of the Alfreton furnace contained cyanogen compounds equivalent to from 8 to 10 grammes of potassium cyanide per cubic metre of gas, much smaller amounts than those above mentioned, but greater than those found on some Other occasions when the alkaline substances contained in the fume consisted chiefly of carbonates.

The chief source of the alkalies which form the cyanides is the coke used as fuel, but the ore and flux also usually contain small quantities; when a fumace is newly blown in, the amount of cyanides is necessarily very small; but a very few weeks’ use suffices to cause an accumulation of a quantity sufficient to exert a marked influence on the chemical actions taking place, whilst a somewhat longer period brings the accumulation πp to the final working average attained when the alkaline compounds mechanically carried off in the fume, and escaping altogether from the furnace through not being intercepted and filtered out by the substances in the upper part, together with those in the cinder, just equal the alkalies brought in by the fuel and burden jointly. It is highly probable, although not absolutely demonstrated, that when charcoal is used as fuel the formation of alkaline cyanides is promoted, owing to the increased quantity of potassium carbonate in the ash of the charcoal as compared with coke; and that this is one of the reasons why the consumption of carbon in the form of charcoal in the Styrian, American, and Swedish furnaces is often less per ton of iron made than that of coke in even the best of the large English furnaces,—the greater ease with which the ores are reduced as compared with English ones being, at any rate in certain cases, another circumstance diminishing the quantity of fuel requisite.

A large number of direct observations as to the progressive changes undergone by the minerals in descending through the furnace have been made, more especially by Ebelmen, Tiinner, and

Lowthian Bell, with the general result of showing that the changes as a whole are substantially those above described; as the iron ore sinks, it becomes deoxidized at a.rate which at first gradually increases, the temperature rising; but by and by the reduction ceases to increase in rate, and would probably almost stop were the inner portions of the lumps as much reduced as the outer portions. Neither direct experiments on the ores in the furnace, nor laboratory experiments, nor the results deducible from the examination of the composition of the gases at different levels indicate that under the conditions of the blast fumace interior complete deoxidation of the ore ensues until the level of the hearth is reached and the iron begins to fuse,—the agents completing the deoxidation being partly the carbonaceous matter of the solid fuel, but to a much greater extent the finely divided carbon precipitated from the carbon oxide in the upper part of the furnace, and the alkaline cyanides.

20. Development and Appropriation of Heat in the Blast Furnace.— The sources of heat in the blast furnace are two in number, viz., the heat brought in by the hot blast, and that generated by the combustion of the fuel. The former of course varies considerably with the nature of the heating arrangement and with the actual weight of blast employed per unit weight of iron smelted; thus, if the weight of air used be 5 ’ 5 times that of the pig iron made (llOcwts. of blast per ton of pig), if its temperature be 500° C., and the average specific heat of its components 0 ’ 23, the heat brought in per unit weight of pig made will be 5 ’ 5 × 500 × 0 ’ 23 = 632 ’ 5 heat units, the weight of the pig iron being the unit of weight; and similarly in other cases. The heat generated by the combustion of the fuel, again, depends, first, on the amount of fuel burnt and the proportion of inert matters (ash) in it and other circumstances modifying its heat of combustion, and, secondly, on the relative amounts of carbon oxide and dioxide formed.

In transforming 1 part of amorphous carbon into carbon dioxide, the heat evolution (the materials and products being all at the ordinary temperature) is close to 8000, the following values having been found by different observers :—
[table]

If, again, carbon oxide be burnt to dioxide, the amount of heat is near to 2400 per unit weight of carbon oxide.
[table]

Hence the heat given out in burning one part by weight of carbon to carbon oxide must be 8000 - ⅞ × 2400 = 2400, since 3 parts of carbon yield 7 of carbon oxide. If then a given quantity of coke containing 95 per cent, of carbon be burnt, two-thirds to carbon oxide and one-third to carbon dioxide, the heat produced will be

× 8000 + 0 ' 95 x2 × 2400 = 4053;

ο o that is, the heat developed by this combustion of one part by weight of fuel would suffice to raise the temperature of 4053 parts by weight of water through 1" C.; or generally, if if ^^ η °f the carbon be burnt to carbon oxide and n to carbon dioxide, p being the per- m + n centage of carbon in the coke (the trifling amount of hydrogen being neglected), the heat development per 100 parts by weight of coke is ρ∖ m × 2400 4—— × 8000 ) · One part by weight of hydrogen + TH + Tl J furnishes about 34,000 heat units when burnt to liquid water, between 28,000 and 29,000 if burnt to vaporous steam; so that, if q be the percentage of hydrogen, the total heat development per one part of fuel is close to p∖ m . × 24 + —— × 80 ) + q × 285; if ∖m+n m+n J q is less than 0 - 5 (as is usually the case) the error caused by neglecting the term involving q altogether is not greater than that due to the uncertainty about the precise values of the heat evolved in burning carbon to carbon oxide and to carbon dioxide (taken above approximately as 2400 and 8000 respectively).

Knowing the quantity of fuel (coke) burnt and the average composition of the waste gases, together with the amount of flux (limestone) employed, the quantity of carbon dioxide and oxide formed by the combustion of the coke and the amount of blast employed to bum it can be readily calculated; for example, in one out of many series of observations made by Lowthian Bell with the present writer’s cooperation, it was found that the average composition by weight of the issuing gases was
[9:13:312]
[table]

and that per unit weight of pig made the amount of coke used was 1 ’ 116, of which 0 ’ 096 was ash and moisture, leaving 1Ό20 of actual carbon, whilst the limestone and mine (calcined Cleveland ore) contained 0 Ό82 carbon and 0 ‘219 oxygen in the form of carbon dioxide, the iron being contained wholly as ferric oxide. The pig contained 3 per cent, of carbon, so that 0 ’ 030 of the total carbon entering the furnace did not escape in the gases; consequently the weight that did escape was l∙θ20 + 0 ’ 082-0 ’ 030 = lO72, whence the gases (leaving the hydrogen out of consideration) were made up of the following amounts :—
[table]

The coke, however, contained a small amount of moisture (some 2'5 per cent.), which would escape as aqueous vapour in the gases; this, together with the hydrogen, would make the weight of the escaping gases a little more, about 6 - 93. The blast introduced containing 3'965 parts of nitrogen (which must have been associated with 1'185 of oxygen forming air) must consequently have weighed 5'150, or making allowance for the moisture contained in it about 5 '20 parts; the total oxygen introduced into the furnace, therefore, must have been l ’ 185in the air of the blast and 0'219 from the carbon dioxide of the flux; whilst, as the pig contained about 95 per cent, of iron, f × - 95 = 0’407 is the corresponding oxygen, making a total of 1’185+ 0 ’ 219 + 0∙407 = 1 ’ 811, to which must be added the oxygen in the moisture of the blast, and that contained in the silica and other impurities reduced in the pig iron, which consequently will give a total very near to the 1 ’ 864 parts calculated from the composition of the gases, and consequently to some extent checking the accuracy of the determination.

The total development of heat inside the furnace is then as follows. The carbon contained in the pig, being produced by the reduction of carbon oxide, is formed in virtue of a reaction which absorbs heat; the total fuel added being in the first instance burnt to carbon oxide will develop l ’ 020 × 2400 = 2448; of this a certain portion is further converted into carbon dioxide in the upper part of the furnace, the amount so converted containing of carbon 0 326 -0Ό82 = 0'24 4, and consequently giving a further heat evolution of 0 - 244 X (8000—2400) = 1366^[21. Lowthian Bell calculates the total carbon in the carbon dioxide of the gases as being formed from carbon oxide, considering that the carbon dioxide of the flux is converted into carbon oxide by the hot carbon of the fuel pari passu with its formation; and hence introduces an additional item into the table of furnace requirements, viz., the heat absorbed in this conversion, and an additional complication into the calculation owing to the subtraction of the carbon of the fuel thus supposed to be consumed in the upper part of the furnace from that burnt by the blast at the bottom. ] (the 0 - 082 being originally contained in the flux as carbon dioxide); whence the total heat evolution is 2448 +1366 = 3814.

The heat brought in by the blast is 5 ’ 20 × 485 × 0 ’ 237 = 597, 485° being the average temperature of the blast and 0 - 237 the specific heat of air; whilst that taken out of the furnace by the waste gases is 6 '93 × 332 × 0’24 = 553, 332° being their average temperature, and 0 - 24 their average specific heat; hence finally the total amount of heat used up in doing the work of the furnace, and lost by radiation, &c>, is 3814 + 597-553 = 3858.

In a similar way in a number of other instances the quantities of heat used up in the various furnace requirements were measured, with the general result that, with large furnaces of the construction employed in the Cleveland and Durham districts (48 to 80 feet in height), smelting calcined Cleveland ironstone either alone or mixed with haematite, a certain amount of heat is required for purposes practically constant and not varying with the richness of the ore and the amount of flux consequently requisite: whilst another portion of the heat is used up for purposes which are much more variable. Including the heat absorbed in the reduction from the gases of the carbon in the pig, the comparatively constant requirements of such furnaces are close to 2600, so that in the instance taken for example above, the non-constant requirements amounted to about 1258, the two sets being made up as follows :—
[table]

Similar results were obtained in several other analogous series of observations, the variable heat requirements differing somewhat in some instances on account of the use of poorer or richer ores, different amounts of flux, &c.; for the details of the methods used in the determination of the various items of furnace requirements see Bell’s Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting, and also the earlier experiments of Vathaire {Étude sur les Hauts Fourneaux). Various publications of Grüner, and also an essay by Habet» (abstracted in the Journ. I. and S. Inst., 1877, 225) may also be consulted with advantage; the numerical values of certain of the items deduced by Grüner from his observations differ somewhat from those of Vathaire and Bell, but not to any very material extent. The general result of these observations is that, with the large English furnaces used in smelting Cleveland ironstone with coke and limestone, about 3850 is the amount of heat required on an average per unit of weight of pig iron made for the various furnace requirements, and that in even the most economically working furnaces the quantity of carbon contained in the issuing gases in the form of carbon dioxide does not exceed one-third of the total quantity of carbon, and rarely exceeds 30 per cent, of that amount, the remainder passing out as carbon oxide. Some of the carbon that does escape as dioxide, about one-fourth, is originally introduced as carbon dioxide contained in the flux (in the illustrative example, given above, 0Ό82 was contained in the flux out of 0 ’ 326 escaping as dioxide), so that only about three-fourths is derived from the fuel; whence it results that even under the most favourable conditions, rarely met with in practice with this class of ores, not more than ⅜ × or 25 per cent, of the carbon of the fuel is ultimately burnt to dioxide, tho remaining 75 per cent, being burnt to carbon oxide, thus giving an effective heat development of 0 ’ 25 × 8000 + 0'75 X 2400 = 3800 instead of 8000; ue., the “duty” actually performed by the fuel is only f⅜⅜⅜, or 47 ’ 5 per cent, of the possible maximum amount; so that if the amounts of heat brought in by the hot blast, and carried out in the waste gases, are approximately equal (which is the case when ordinary cast iron stoves are used, delivering blast at temperatures near 450°), it finally results that, to produce the heat requisite for the various furnace requirements (amounting on an average to 3850), an amount of carbon must be burnt equal to ff⅛⅞ or 1Ό13 times the weight of the pig iron made. Taking average coke to contain 7 per cent, of moisture and ash, and, consequently 93 per cent, of carbon, this represents 1 0 0 ^ = 1'089 parts of coke per unit weight of pig iron, or 21f cwts. per ton as the minimum practicable consumption of fuel attainable with calcined Cleveland ironstone, under the condition that the blast brings in as much heat as the waste gases carry out.

It does not by any means follow, however, that only this minimum practicable consumption of coke will be requisite in any given furnace. When the dimensions are not such as to cause the most economical employment of the fuel, a considerably larger quantity of fuel may be requisite to enable the whole of the iron in the ore [9:13:313] to be satisfactorily extracted and a saleable pig produced; in this case the actual heat consumption remains about the same, but a less amount of carbon dioxide and a larger quantity of carbon oxide escape in the waste gases; this is particularly noticeable when anthracite is used as fuel instead of coke, as in many American furnaces. Thus, in a series of observations parallel with those detailed above, but made with a smaller furnace (using coke and calcined Cleveland ironstone), the size of which was insufficient to cause the most economical action possible (48 feet in height instead of 80), the average composition of the gases by weight was
[table]

i.e., they contained much less carbon dioxide relatively to the carbon oxide than those escaping from the larger furnace, whilst the amount of carbon burnt in the form of coke was increased from 1Ό20 parts to 1'318 parts per unit of weight of pig (or from about 22 ’ 3 to 28 ’ 8 cwts. of coke per ton of pig, the coke containing about 91 ‘5 per cent, of carbon and 8 - 5 per cent, of moisture and ash, &c.). Of this extra fuel consumption part only was expended to generate the heat requisite for the furnace requirements, owing to the formation of less carbon dioxide and more carbon oxide; the remainder produced the effect of sensibly raising the temperature of the exit gases, which escaped at the average temperature of 452° C. instead of 332° C., thus carrying out of the furnace much more heat than was brought in by the blast. ,

If by the use of a hotter blast more heat is brought into the furnace by this means than will supply the loss of heat in the waste gases experienced with the less highly heated blast, one of three things must result: either less coke will be requisite to produce the heat necessary for the various furnace requirements; or the surplus heat will be carried out in the waste gases, they being at a higher temperature; or the fuel will be burnt to less advantage, a smaller proportion of carbon dioxide being formed and a larger one of carbon oxide. As to what does actually take place in such a case, opinions are somewhat divided; for, whilst most iron masters maintain that a sensible diminution in fuel requisite per ton of iron is always occasioned by employing a hotter blast, others (especially Bell) consider that their experience proves that in certain cases, e.g., with Cleveland ore, no actual saving in fuel accompanies the use of blast at temperatures above about 500° (see § 21).

The results obtained by Bell with blast-furnaces using Cleveland ironstone and coke are applicable, with appropriate modifications, to furnaces employing different ores and fuel. For instance, Crossley found {Journal Iron and Steel Inst., 1871, ii. 157) that a furnace 67 feet in height, 19 wide (boshes), and 13,124 cubic feet capacity, smelting Askam haematite and Red Bay ore at Askam-in-Furness, produced grey Bessemer pig with 22f cwt. of coke to the ton of iron (1 ’ 1375 per unit of weight of pig), the heat requirements during the process being as follows (the mode of representation adopted above being employed, and the heat viewed by Bell as consumed during the reaction of carbon on the carbon dioxide of the flux being left out of account) :—
[table]

1 his amount of heat was supplied as follows:

Total carbon of coke burnt to carbon oxide P0625 × 2400=2550

Portion of ditto further burnt to carbon dioxide 0Ί62 × 5600= 907

Heat brought in by blast 577

4034 Less heat carried out in waste gases 609

3425

In this case the carbon carried out as dioxide in the escaping gases was only 20 - 2 per cent, of the total carbon therein contained; so that here the fuel was burnt to less advantage than in the most economically worked Cleveland iron furnaces. This, however, was partly due to the fact that in order to make very grey Bessemer pig a larger quantity of coke was employed than would suffice to make forge iron, viz., about 2 cwts. per ton extra; so that forge iron could be run in the same furnace with an expenditure of about 211 cwts., or 1Ό825 parts of coke per unit weight of pig. Other things remaining the same, this would represent an amount of total carbon burnt equal to about 0’97 per unit weight of pig, which must, therefore, be burnt in the following way to give the same heat as before, viz., 2550 + 907 = 3457 due to the fuel :—
[table]

Since the carbon in the carbon dioxide of the limestone was 0Ό555, the total carbon as dioxide in the gases would thus be 0 ’ 2016 + 0 ’ 0555 = 0∙257, whilst the total carbon as oxide and dioxide would be 0 ’ 97 + 0 , 0555 - 0∙040 = 0 ’ 9855 (0’040 being the carbon in the pig iron, which contained 4 per cent, of carbon); so that the escaping gases would contain, when forge iron was being made, about 26 per cent, of the total carbon present therein as carbon dioxide and 74 per cent, as carbon oxide,—still indicating a fuel expenditure less economical than in the most favourably arranged Cleveland furnaces in which 30 to 33 per cent, of the total carbon in the escaping gases is contained as dioxide; presumably this is due either to the smaller height of the furnace (67 feet only) or to the more difficult reducibility of the ore used.

On the other hand, the Wrbna (Eisenerz) charcoal furnaces smelting spathic ore (which is somewhat more readily reducible than calcined Cleveland ironstone) were found to give the following values, reduced as before to a unit of weight of pig (white iron) (Tünner, Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1873, p. 433):—
[table]

The fuel burnt was charcoal containing about 0 ’ 63 parts of carbon per unit weight of pig, which in order to produce 2727 heat units must have been burnt as follows :—
[table]

Of this 0 ’ 63 parts of carbon burnt 0 - 045 was taken up again by the iron, leaving 0 585 as the total quantity of carbon escaping in the waste gases. Hence θ' 2 ∣ ^ or 371 per cent, of the carbon was burnt to dioxide, and 62 - 9 per cent, to carbon oxide, which represents a more economical use of the fuel than in the Cleveland furnaces, notwithstanding the smaller size of the Wrbna furnace. Bell has also calculated (Chemical Phenomena, p. 420) for the same furnace very much the same numbers, the furnace requirements being estimated by him as slightly in excess of Tunner’s valuation.

Calculations as to the development and appropriation of heat in the Cedar Point anthracite furnace, U.S., founded on the same principles as the above cited examples have been made by Witherbee (Transactions Am. Inst. Mining Engineers')·, the consumption of anthracite as compared with charcoal in American furnaces is always greater, indicating a smaller proportion of carbon dioxide ultimately formed.

As far as the data at present extant go, it does not appear that in any furnace yet constructed burning coke, charcoal, anthracite, or coal, upwards of 40 per cent, of the carbon in the issuing gases is, on an average, contained as dioxide, the remainder being oxide, although somewhat larger amounts are occasionally found as exceptional occurrences. Admitting that ⅜ of the carbon of the fuel is burnt to dioxide and ·| to oxide, the heat evolution per unit of carbon burnt would be ⅛ × 8000 + ⅜× 2400 = 4640 instead of 8000, which would be developed were all burnt to dioxide; that is, the “duty” actually performed by the fuel would be 58 per cent, of the possible maximum amount; so that even in such a furnace the consumption of fuel would be at least l⅛χ⅛= 1'72 times the [9:13:314] amount that would be requisite could perfect combustion be effected. If, however, the issuing gases be so burnt in heating the blast that more heat is brought into the furnace than is carried out by the waste gases, the excess is virtually obtained by more perfect combustion, though not actually so burnt inside the furnace; whilst, if the gases are also employed to raise steam for the blowing engines and lifts, &c., the fuel thus saved virtually is equivalent to a diminution in the blast furnace consumption; for, were perfect combustion obtainable in the furnace, extra fuel would have to be burnt outside for these purposes.

These remarks apply a fortiori to furnaces in which coal is employed as fuel instead of coke or charcoal. The heat of combustion of average coal (after allowing for ash and supposing it to be burnt to carbon dioxide and water vapour) may be taken as about 8300 (see § 10); hence to afford sufficient heat for the requirements of a furnace smelting average Cleveland ironstone, viz., 3850, only ⅜¾⅞⅛ = 0 , 464 parts of coal would be requisite, could complete combustion be ensured, or 9∣ cwts. per ton of pig (assuming the sensible heat carried out by the waste gases and brought in by the blast to be equal). The actual consumption in furnaces using raw coal is, however, several times this amount,—30 cwts. being a low estimate in such cases, whilst 40 and even 50 cwts. of coal per ton of pig made is not an infrequent consumption: thus even with Feme’s self-coking furnace (§ 12), which reduced the consumption of coal from 52 ‘5 to 33'5 cwts. per ton of pig, the consumption was upwards of three times the theoretical amount; with anthracite-consuming furnaces, such as those used in America, the consumption of fuel varies from 25 cwts. per ton of pig in the largest and best constructed furnaces to 40 cwts. or so in the older and smaller furnaces, the consumption being as a rule, however, somewhat less than that of more bituminous raw coal in the English open-topped furnaces. The reason for the extra fuel consumption in raw eoal furnaces is simply that the nature of the chemical reactions taking place in the upper part of the furnace, especially the action of heat alone upon the coal, necessarily causes the evolution of much free hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, and carbon oxide, which escape unburnt, thus preventing the consumption of the fuel to the maximum advantage: where the gases are collected and burnt, this loss would not be material were it not that ordinarily the heat obtainable from the gases is far in excess of that requisite to raise steam for blowing and lifting the burden to the furnace top, &c. These reasons are also to a great extent operative with anthracite as compared with coke. On the other hand, the smaller weight of charcoal ordinarily requisite to smelt a given ore is partly due to the more ready action of carbon dioxide on charcoal than on coke forming carbon oxide, so that virtually the ore is partly reduced by the carbon of the charcoal (this being converted into carbon oxide, which deoxidizes the ore) to a greater extent with charcoal than with coke; i.e., the charcoal is more completely oxidized, and the ore is more deoxidized at the top of the furnace and less at the bottom than is the case {caeteris paribus) with coke, so that a smaller weight of charcoal ultimately performs the same work as a larger quantity of coke. The larger amount of alkalies in charcoal, producing more cyanides, probably also aids in the more rapid reduction relatively to the weight of fuel used.

In a prize essay, Professor Habets has given formulae for calculating the value of a given weight of iron ore of given composition, the price of the pig iron made from it, and the quantities of ore and limestone requisite to produce a unit of weight of pig, &c. (see abstract in Journ. I. and S. Inst., 1877, 225), and has also arranged formulae for calculating the amount of fuel that ought to be required for the smelting of such ores, &c., assuming that the duty actually performed by the fuel is 48 per cent, of the possible maximum amount. In these calculations slightly different values are taken for certain of the heat requirements from those given above; thus for the reduction of pig iron (containing carbon, silicon, &c. ) the total heat consumption is taken as 1984, the amounts assumed by Bell, Crossley, and Tiinner as above described being respectively 1931, 1871, and 1670; that carried out by the molten pig is taken at 260 for cold working, 270 for medium, and 285 for hot, Bell’s figure (and Vathaire’s) being 330, whilst Tiinner takes 340 from Rinman’s observations; and the loss by radiation (presumably including the tuyere water) is taken as 400 (Bell = 349—deduced by the present writer from a round general average result by difference; Crossley — 359; Tiinner=192, the furnace being a much smaller one in this latter case), and so on throughout; but on the whole Habets’s formulae are based on much the same valuations as those above cited. The instances given above, however, indicate that the results obtainable with one class of ores, fuels, &c., are only applicable to another class with considerable latitude of variation, and that it is impracticable to fix a hard and fast line as the limit of economy of fuel universally applicable. Where, however, the fuel is burnt differently (to less advantage, for instance, so that, instead of one part of carbon giving 0 - 48 of the total heat production as “duty,” it only gives say 0 - 40), the formulae of Habets will still be applicable, only requiring the application of a coefficient (~°=l - 2 in the case supposed).

' Temperature of Blast Pumαce at Various Levels.— Many observations of the rate of increase of temperature from the mouth of the furnace have been made by Tiinner, Ebelmen, and Lowthian Bell. When fresh materials have been just introduced cool into the furnace, of course they intercept heat from the escaping gases, acting precisely like the brickwork stacks of a Siemens regenerative furnace; this effect, however, cannot be carried so far as to prevent the escaping gases from passing out at an average temperature which, if not elevated, is at least sensible,—the actual temperature varying with the conditions obtaining. Since heat is generated by the reduction of ferric oxide by carbon oxide, more heat being evolved by the oxidation of the carbon than is absorbed in the reduction of the iron oxide, roughly in the ratio of 3 to 2, it results that there is always a source of heat in the upper part of the furnace; and, unless fresh materials can be supplied sufficiently rapidly to keep the escaping gases always at a given low temperature by their direct cooling effect, the temperature must rise by the reduction of the ore. A condition of equilibrium as to temperature is consequently finally arrived at when the sums of the generations of heat by chemical action at each and every particular level, and of the absorptions of heat by direct communication to the fresh charges added from time to time, balance one another; when this condition of things is arrived at the temperatures of the escaping gas, and of the substances generally at each level, become constant, or rather would do so were the fresh materials added continuously instead of intermittently, and were the action of the furnace absolutely uniform. The circumstances which regulate the most advantageous way in which fuel can be burnt, i.e., the economy of fuel in the furnace, consequently regulate the temperature of the escaping gases, which accordingly is variable with the quantity of fuel burnt per unit of iron smelted, with the size and shape of the furnace, the character of the ore employed, &c. Under particular conditions, especially when a large mass of fresh materials has been added, the escaping gases may be so cool that the aqueous vapour present is condensed into mist, whilst the hand may be placed in the gases without being burnt; ordinarily, however, the temperature at the mouth averages 200° or 300° C., and with small furnaces and difficultly reducible ore requiring a large fuel consumption may be much higher. One great effect of increasing the height of furnaces smelting clay ironstone {e.g., Cleveland ore) is the reduction of the amount of fuel requisite owing to the cooling influence exerted upon the temperature of the escaping gases which pass off, thereby leaving in the furnace heat which otherwise would have to be provided by burning more fuel. Of the numerous particular determinations that have been made of the temperatures at different levels in different cases, the following may be cited as examples :—

21. Conditions Regulating Economy of Fuel and Cost of Production.— It is evident from the data given in the preceding section that, when the amount of cinder formed is less, a smaller quantity of fuel will do the work of iron smelting, the amount of heat absorption for the variable requirements being lessened the less limestone is causticized and the less hot cinder flows out of the furnace. Evidently also, the hotter the blast and the cooler the issuing ga^es, the less fuel must be burnt to generate the particular amount of heat requisite for a given furnace working under given conditions as to quality of ore, &c.; whilst the more carbon is burnt to carbon dioxide and the less to carbon oxide the less total carbon is requisite for the same end. As regards the possibility of diminishing fuel consumption by the use of richer ores and less flux, this is largely a matter of local circumstances; when there is a choice possible between two deposits of ore, one richer than the other, and each equally good in other respects, the cost of smelting the richer ore will evidently be somewhat less than that of working the other; as regards the other circumstances, it is by no means a matter of indifference in reference to cost of production whether the more economical conditions be attended to or not; thus, in the case of the 48 and 80 foot furnaces referred to in the last section, the difference between 22 ’ 3 and 28 ’ 8 cwts. of coke consumed per ton of iron involves a very considerable difference in cost of production. It is calculated that the increased size of furnaces used in England at the present day, as compared with those in use some thirty or forty years ago, represents an average saving of fuel equivalent to about 50 per cent, of the weight of the pig iron made in coal, ie., a saving of 10 cwts. of coal per ton of iron. The saving effected by the use of waste gases for heating the blast, although less than this, still represents an enormous aggregate: in the Cleveland district alone the saving in coal from this cause is calculated to amount to upwards of 1,000,000 tons annually.

To some little extent the amount of fuel consumed is variable with the rate at which the furnace is driven; that is, if a given quality of pig is produced when the furnace is making 300 tons per week with a given coke consumption (the fuel being burnt under the most favourable conditions practicable), and the furnace be then driven at a higher speed so as to make 400 tons, either a little more coke must be added relatively to the burden, or else there will be a tendency to make a less strongly marked crystalline pig; instead of producing the coarsest crystallized iron (No. 1 grey pig), this quality will sink to the less largely crystalline numbers (Nos. 2, 3, or 4), or even to mottled or white iron. If, however, the fuel is not burnt to the maximum possible advantage in the first instance, increasing the rate of production may under certain circumstances not only not cause an increase in the fuel consumption, but may even slightly diminish it, by lessening the amount of heat lost by radiation, &c., relatively to the metal produced. Everything remaining the same, decreasing the fuel relatively to the burden decreases the quality of the iron run, and vice versa; with Cleveland ironstone an extra consumption of half a cwt. or less of coke per ton of pig suffices to raise the quality of iron run one number in the scale, i.e., from No. 4 to 3, from 3 to 2, or from 2 to 1. According to Crossley (loe. cit.) about 2 cwts. of coke per ton of pig corresponds to the difference between running white iron and grey Bessemer pig, the ore smelted being Askam haematite and Fisher Red Bay ore. Tiinner states (loc. citi) that at Neuberg, with a blast at 200°, from 15 ’ 4 to 15 ’ 6, cwts. of charcoal were used per ton of white iron, but 23 to 24 cwts. per ton of grey iron, making a difference of some 8 cwts. per ton, or four times the amount given by Crossley; at Heft, with a blast at 200°, 12 - 6 to 14 cwts. of charcoal were formerly required per ton of white iron, and 20 cwts. and upwards per ton of grey iron, making a difference of more than 6 cwts. per ton, or upwards of three times Crossley’s figure. Although a variation in the amount of fuel burnt under constant conditions denotes a correlative variation in the temperature of the hearth (No. 1 iron being actually hotter as it flows from a furnace in regular work than No. 4, for instance), yet the influence thereby produced on the chemical composition is, according to Lowthian Bell’s experiments, not marked, at any rate so far as Cleveland pig is concerned, the differences between various specimens of different numbers not being greater than those between various specimens of the same numbers,—the difference in the crystallinity of the pig being in fact more probably ascribable to the circumstance that the hotter the iron the longer is the time taken to solidify, and the more completely is the exfoliation of the graphite and the crystallization upon it of the remaining iron, &c., effected, than to differences of actual constitution. On the other hand, it is a matter of usual opinion, if not of invariable experience, that highly crystalline grey Bessemer pigs are richer in silicon than others, and that this is due to the higher temperature of the hearth facilitating reduction of silicon; again, it is usually considered that white irons are apt to contain more sulphur than grey irons made from the same ore; this circumstance, however, is possibly rather due to differences in the average composition of ore smelted and amount of flux added than simply to variations in amount of fuel consumed; thus diminishing the amount of lime added as a flux below a certain point often increases the sulphur in the pig, so that upwards of 1 per cent, may be present, when with more lime the quantity would be only one or two tenths per cent., the iron being white in the first case and grey when more lime is employed.

As regards the temperature of the blast, the fact that heating the blast enabled iron to be made with much less fuel consumption than was requisite with cold blast was recognized immediately after Neilson’s discovery or invention; but it soon became also manifest that a deteriorating effect was often produced upon the iron smelted from certain kinds of ore by the use of the hot blast, due to the higher temperature attained in the hearth facilitating the reduction of phosphorus, sulphur, and especially of silicon. The advocates of the very highly heated blast obtainable by means of the Whitwell stove consider that, as the heat is obtained from the waste gases at a comparatively nominal cost, the more heat can be thus introduced into the furnace the better, the saving in fuel being directly proportionate to the increase in blast temperature; it would seem from Bell’s observations, however, that the advantages thus obtainable are not always quite so great as appears at first sight to be the case. If less fuel be burnt in the furnace, a less absolute weight of blast per given amount of pig run will be requisite, and consequently a higher proportionate temperature must be given to the blast to enable it to introduce the heat equivalent to the fuel thus saved; for each successive diminution of fuel to the extent say of 1 per cent, an increase in temperature of blast will be requisite, the rate of increase not being constant, but accelerating at a rapid rate; so that finally an increase in blast temperature of 100° from 1100° to 1200° only represents about half the amount of heat introduced into the furnace that would be introduced by raising the blast from 300° to 400% The advantage of highly heating the blast then is not directly proportionate to the temperature attained as regards saving of fuel, but something less; according to Bell, practical experience shows that with certain ores, e.g., Cleveland ironstone, the effect of highly superheating the blast to temperatures much above 500° is not to render any considerable saving of coke practicable, but mainly only to raise the temperature of the issuing waste gases. Other iron masters, however, dissent from this view, and consider that by the use of a blast heated to 700° and upwards by a Whitwell stove, instead of. to 450° or 500° by the older iron stoves, a distinct saving in the amount of coke requisite to produce a ton of pig iron from Cleveland ironstone is [9:13:316] effected; so that, instead of requiring an amount of coke to be consumed equal in weight to about 1 ’ 09 times that of the pig iron made (nearly 21f cwts. per ton), which as stated in the previous section is the minimum practical average consumption possible when the amount of heat brought in by the blast about equals that carried out by the waste gases, a smaller amount of fuel will suffice, from 0 ’ 95 to 0 ’ 90 parts of coke (19 and 18 cwts. per ton) only being necessary with blast heated to 700° and upwards by a Whitwell stove, the heat carried out by the waste gases being less than that brought in by the blast by an amount equal to that which would otherwise have been generated by the fuel saved. With ores other than Cleveland ironstone the same kind of result is obtained; not only in England and Wales, but also in France, Germany, Switzerland, America, and elsewhere, the Siemens-Cowper and Whitwell stoves have been extensively adopted on account first of the saving of fuel effected by them, and secondly of the greater regularity and efficiency in working.

On the other hand there is no doubt that increasing the height of a furnace smelting calcined Cleveland ironstone from 48 to 80 feet causes a considerable saving in fuel; as shown in the previous section, the increased height acts partly by permitting the gases to escape at a lower temperature, and partly by enabling the fuel to be burnt with the formation of a smaller relative proportion of carbon oxide and a larger one of carbon dioxide than is the case with the smaller furnace. When, however, a still greater height is given to the furnace, a further saving in fuel and larger relative production of carbon dioxide do not seem to occur, furnaces of 90 and 100 feet in height not exhibiting any marked advantages over 80-foot furnaces working under the same conditions, so far as consumption of fuel is concerned. Even if Bell’s views as regards the non-apparent advantage of increasing the blast temperature above 500° C. with the furnaces smelting Cleveland ore experimented on by him be admitted to apply in all cases where this ore is used, it does not follow that they are applicable to other furnaces smelting different kinds of ore, nor does it follow that 80 feet in height is the limit beyond which no visible saving is effected in all cases; thus for instance with a furnace smelting (at Consett) a mixture of Cleveland ore and haematite in such proportions that about half the iron made came from each ore, a distinct saving of coke was found to accompany the substitution ot Whitwell stoves giving blast at about 720° for iron stoves giving blast at about 450°; whereas with the less heated blast the coke consumption was 2275 cwts. per ton of iron, with the hotter blast it was only 18 cwts., the conditions, character of ore and flux used and pig produced, &c., being pretty nearly the same, the furnace being 55 feet in height in each case. Again, on rebuilding such a furnace (for the purpose of using the same mixture of ores) to a height of about 70 feet, it was found that the increased dimensions, so far from producing the beneficial effects which such a change would have given had Cleveland ore only been used, introduced such irregularities in working that the height had to be reduced to the former amount, 55 feet or so. Similar results have also been found with furnaces using Lancashire haematite only; thus a Barrow furnace built to* the height of 75 feet, and using Cowper stoves, worked so badly that it was reduced to 61 feet, when it worked well. Analogous results were also obtained at Workington, a 70-foot furnace working much better when cut down to 55 feet; in America also it has been found that charcoal furnaces, increased materially above the original height, worked irregularly until the height was reduced again, when the working again became good. With easily reducible Belgian ores furnaces of 50 to 60 feet in height are found to giγe the best results both as to quantity of iron run and as to economy of fuel. On the other hand, an increase in height from 45 to 60 feet in furnaces smelting Staffordshire ores was found to cause an average saving of upwards of 10 cwts. of coal per ton of iron (Plum, Journal I. and S. Brisk, 1871, ii. 227), whilst two furnaces at Stanhope (New Jersey) using magnetic ore, one 80 feet high and of 16,400 cubic feet capacity, the other 55 feet high and of 9200 cubic feet capacity, differed by several cwts. in the amount of coal requisite to produce a ton of pig, the difference being in favour of tne larger furnace; similarly at Glendon, U.S., two furnaces, 72 and 50 feet in height and 11,900 and 4800 cubic feet capacity respectively, differed by 3 to 4 cwts. of coal per ton of pig, the taller furnace requiring the least fuel (F. Firmstone, Trans. Am. Journ. Mining Engineers).

With charcoal furnaces smelting grey iron, increasing the blast temperature from about 200° to 400° or 500° C. causes a marked saving of fuel; but the utility of heating the blast above 300° or even a somewhat lower limit for such furnaces when making white iron is regarded by Tiinner as extremely doubtful: thus he states (Journal I. and S. Inst., 1873, 442) that charcoal furnaces at Neuberg which used 23 to 24 cwts. of charcoal per ton of grey Bessemer pig (and only about 15⅛ for white iron) when the blast was at 200°, only required 19 to 20 cwts. per ton of grey pig when the blast was heated to 500°, representing a saving of some 4 cwts. per ton of charcoal; similarly at Heft the charcoal consumption was 20 cwts. and upwards per ton of first class grey Bessemer pig with blast at 200 a ∙, and only 17 to 18 cwts. with blast at 350° to 400“ C., representing a saving of at least 2⅛ cwts. of charcoal per ton of pig. Analogous results have also been recorded as obtained with Carinthian furnaces, a saving of 25 to 30 per cent, in the charcoal used accompanying the heating of the blast to 500° or 600° instead of the much lower temperature formerly employed; similarly with Swedish charcoal furnaces smelting bog ores, the use of hot blast at 350° instead of cold blast producing a saving in fuel estimated as averaging one-third, or 33 per cent, of the larger* amount, and the employment of blast at 200° effecting a saving of one-fifth, or 20 per cent., with mountain ores (Jem-Kontorets Annoter, 1859, p. 273). The much smaller consumption of fuel in the Wrbna charcoal furnaces and others using certain Austrian ores as compared with English coke furnaces appears, from the results of Tiinner, quoted in the last section, to be mainly due to the smaller amount of slag produced, and the consequently diminished furnace requirements, a portion of the diminution being due to the somewhat larger formation of carbon dioxide relatively to the carbon oxide in the escaping gases; with other ores producing more cinder, the quantity of charcoal used per ton of iron run does not seem to be materially less than the amount of coke employed with English furnaces, so far as comparisons can be instituted.

On the whole, the precise details as regards the dimensions of furnace, temperature of blast, <fcc., the use of which will enable iron to be smelted from a given kind of ore with a minimum expenditure of fuel, cannot always be distinctly stated, the requisite data not existing: evidently the data available for one class of ore and fuel and iron produced are not applicable without material correction to other classes.^[24. An instructive essay by J. Walters on the best-known means of increasing the production of blast furnaces without at the same time interfering with the quality of their products, discussing the dimensions as regards height, diameter of both size and throat, &c., and other conditions best suited for certain classes of ores, is to be found in tl⅛e Reime Universelle, 1877, and in abstract in the Journal I. and S. InsL, 1877 (Foreign Report), p. 125. See also papers by T. Whitwell (Iron, 1878) “On the Construction, Dimensions, and Management of Blast Furnaces.” ] All existing experience, however, goes to show that the blast furnace is an instrument in which it is impossible completely to utilize the calorific power of the fuel burnt. Owing to the nature of the com·, plex reactions regulating the resultant chemical changes taking place in the furnace, a considerable proportion of the fuel inevitably must escape as carbon oxide, and it is not practicable to restore to the furnace the whole of the heat thus not utilized by employing the waste gases to heat up the blast, although a portion of this heat may thus be saved. Thus, in the case of average Cleveland ironstone, the 3850 units of heat per unit of weight of pig requisite for the various items of furnace consumption would be obtained by the combustion of less than 0 - 5 part by weight of carbon (representing 10 cwts. of carbon or less per· ton of pig, i.e., about 10 ’ 5 cwts. of average coke per ton of pig), could all the carbon be burnt to carbon dioxide; whilst for ores containing less earthy matter, and hence requiring less flux and producing less cinder, considerably smaller amounts would be required, in some cases not mor? than 7 or 8 cwts. per ton. In practice, even with the most economical arrangements at present known, the consumption of fuel is largely in excess of the minimum quantity thus theoretically requisite, the coke used varying from 18 or 19 cwts. in the most favourable cases to 25 and even 30 cwts. per ton of pig under less economical conditions.

A portion'of the excess of fuel thus burnt may be utilized in generating steam by burning the waste gases under the boilers. Bell calculates that somewhat upwards of 1400 heat units per unit weight of pig iron were thus utilized in the works serving as the chief basis of his inquiries, [9:13:317] the total amount of water required for steam purposes being 2 , 55 times the weight of the pig iron made (including the steam used for blast engine, pumps, &c., and allowing 15 per cent, for waste by priming, cleaning boilers, &c.), this water being raised to 100° in a hot well (by the waste steam) and simply converted into steam at 45 lb pressure (non-condensing engines used). Adding this to 3850, a total of 5250 is obtained as heat actually accounted for in smelting average Cleveland ore when the steam power is obtained solely from waste gases as fuel, representing consequently about ⅛⅜⅞⅜ = θ'656 parts of carbon, say 0 ’ 7 parts of coke, or 14 cwts. per ton. Hence even when the consumption of coke is 18 cwts. per ton of pig (below which even with the most highly heated blast continuous production never seems to have been effected, whilst usually a considerably greater amount is used), a large waste of heat through imperfect combustion below the boilers, and radiation, &c., therefrom, is occasioned. A fortiori the same argument applies to a blast furnace using raw coal, even when close-topped.

When compared with other modes of burning fuel in metallurgical operations, &c., however, the blast furnace does not seem to be so wasteful as many of these appliances; thus Grüner calculates the following values as approximately the percentages utilized of the total heat capacity of the fuel employed in various kinds of furnaces :—
[table]

The rate of production iu a blast furnace is, up to a certain extent, variable with its dimensions; but no well marked correlative increase appears to have been effected in the make of furnaces of considerably upwards of 15,000 or 20,000 cubic feet capacity above that of furnaces of these dimensions. The quality of the ore smelted also largely affects the rate, the furnace being of such dimensions as to give the maximum saving of fuel practicable, and the least crushing of the ore by its own weight, together with the minimum tendency to scaffolding, slips, and other practical inconveniences; thus, whilst from furnaces smelting Cumberland and North Lancashire haematite an output of 600 and even 800 tons per week has been accomplished, from 400 to 500 tons per week is the usual result with large furnaces smelting clay ironstone, such as that of the Cleveland district. Somewhat smaller yields than these are obtainable from furnaces of less capacity.

Charcoal furnaces usually make more pig for a given amount of cubic capacity than when coke, anthracite, or raw coal is employed as fuel: thus, whilst some Styrian charcoal furnaces have been made to produce for every 1000 cubic feet capacity from 110 to 130 tons weekly (the capacity being only 500 to 1200 cubic feet), and whilst the Swedish and Norwegian and some American charcoal furnaces of 1000 to 3000 cubic feet capacity produce per 1000 cubic feet 50 to 70 tons weekly, the large English coke blast furnaces of 15,000 to 20,000 cubic feet and upwards usually produce only 15 to 30 tons weekly per 1000 cubic feet. Those of the coke, anthracite, and coal burning furnaces of Europe and America of somewhat less capacity than these largest sizes usually produce somewhat more than 20 to 30 tons weekly per 1000 cubic feet; but in many cases this is done at the expenditure of a greater amount of fuel than that employed in the larger furnaces (z.e., after making allowance for the difference in the amount of flux added, and cinder produced, &c. ). This is not the case with the European charcoal furnaces, for in some of these the consumption of fuel is not greater, and in other cases is notably less, per ton of iron made than in the largest English coke-employing furnaces, even after making these allowances. In many American charcoal furnaces, however, notwithstanding that a purer ore is smelted than that used in some of the European charcod furnaces, the consumption of charcoal appears to be notably higher, approaching 18 and 19 and even 20 cwts. of charcoal per ton of iron instead of 15 to 17 cwts.; still, as compared with coke, these charcoal furnaces ordinarily consume a smaller amount of fuel. According to Àkermann the charcoal used in America is usually very much more dense than that employed in the Swedish charcoal furnaces, so that a bushel sometimes represents some 30 per cent, more of weight of fuel. With charcoal as fuel it does not appear that an increased rate of driving the furnace (by putting on more blast) necessarily causes an increase in the fuel consumption; indeed, the opposite result has been observed in certain cases, at least to a certain extent, the cause being the relatively smaller loss ot heat by radiation, &c., from the furnace. For any given furnace and ore, &c., there is a particular rate of driving which gives the minimum fuel consumption: a more rapid rate requires more fuel because the gases have not time to effect their full action on the ores, and less carbon dioxide is formed; a slower rate causes more loss by radiation, &c., relatively to the output. Up to a certain extent it is often advantageous to use a little extra fuel, and increase the rate of production beyond the rate that would correspond to the minimum fuel consumption; which is probably the reason why in many instances the fuel employed per ton of Iron is somewhat larger than that found to be requisite in other analogous cases, where the rate of production is somewhat lower; the exact point at which the advantages of increased rate of production are counterbalanced by extra cost for fuel, and extra wear and tear, &c., necessarily varies in each particular case.

Cold Blast as compared with Hot.— In reference to the employment of cold blast for the production of iron, the saving in fuel occasioned by the use of heated air has been practically proved to be so great that excepting for certain special brands of iron the use of hot blast has almost entirely superseded that of cold; the evidence in support of the alleged deterioration in quality thereby caused is, however, not so conclusive as that in behalf of the economy produced. With a cold blast the mass of fuel in front of the tuyeres is visibly much less, brightly incandescent than that in a hot blast furnace, being comparatively black, indicating considerable local refrigeration, and hence probably differences in the amount of silicon, sulphur, phosphorus, &c., reduced in the hearth; but analyses of hot and cold blast pig irons made from the same ore do not always show such marked differences as might be anticipated; opinions are in fact somewhat divided even at the present day on this point, but such of these opinions as admit of being checked by figures usually incline to the non-existence of any material difference between the English pig irons produced from a given ore, flux, and fuel .by cold and hot blast respectively. On the other hand, it was for many years after Neilson’s patent was taken out a matter of belief, especially in Wales, that the increased impurity of the pig made with hot blast necessitated so much more labour and expenditure of fuel in puddling, to give a wrought iron equally good with that made by cold blast, as to render the actual saving doubtful; whilst with certain Swedish charcoal irons of the highest brands, e. g., Dannemora iron from magnetite, cold blast is still adopted on the ground that experience has shown a marked deterioration in the character of the iron produced when the blast was heated. With other similar Swedish and Norwegian brands, on the other hand, a heated blast is in use, it being considered that no perceptible deterioration in quality is thereby occasioned; this remark equally applies to the Styrian and Carinthian furnaces employing Eisenerz and Lolling spathic ores, and to those at Fullonica where the Elba specular ore is smelted; Tiinner states that the use of hot blast for Eisenerz charcoal iron production in no way necessarily produces any deterioration in quality; and Bell is of the same opinion so far as English irons made with hot blast up to 500° C. are concer ned. In many cases the superiority of cold blast over hot blast iron alleged to exist, as shown by chemical analyses, and more especially by mechanical tests, is really due to the fact that the ores used for the two are not identical, the cold blast metal being made from a purer quality. In fact, the notion that cold blast iron is vastly superior to hot seems to have been originally to a considerable extent the result of a trade manoeuvre; thus the ironstone of the Scotch coal-fields near Glasgow being of a refractory nature required the consumption of a much larger amount of fuel with cold blast than did the more easily reducible South Wales ores; but with hot blast a much greater saving in fuel was produced with the Scotch than with the Welsh ore; as early as 1834 Dufrenoy (director-general of mines, France) specially investigated the relative advantages of hot and cold blast with these two ores, and found that, whilst with the Scotch ore the saving produced at the Clyde works by heating the blast to about 320° by an expenditure of 8 cwts. of coal per ton of iron was (after allowing for this 8 cwts., and taking into account the coal used for the blowing engines) equivalent on the whole to a diminution of coal consumed from 153 to 59 cwts. of coal per ton of iron,^[25. Dr Clark read before the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1835 a paper “On the Application of the Hot Blast in the Manufacture of Iron,” in which he stated that at the Clyde works, prior to the end of 1829. the average consumption of coke (45 parts of which were obtained from 100 of raw coal) was equivalent to 8 tons 1⅛ cwt. per ton of pig (8'06 per unit of pig iron) when cold blast was used; in 1830, when hot blast was used with the same coke as fuel, the consumption was reduced to an amount equivalent to 5 tons 3∣ cwts. (5 ’ 16 per unit of pig); and in 1833, when a hotter blast and actual raw coal were employed, the consumption was only 2 tons 5⅛ cwts. per ton of pig (2 ‘26 per unit of pig), this being exclusive of 8 cwts. of coal used in heating up the blast, making a total of 2 tons 13⅛ cwts. (2.66 per unit of pig),—figures substantially the same as those of Dufrenoy, representing a reduction in fuel consumption nearly in the ratio of one to threê-parts of Scotch coal used (as coke) with cold blast and Scotch ore. Much the same figures have also been given by Mushet: thus he states that in 1797 with cold blast the consumption of coal at the Clyde works was 7 tons 3 cwts. per ton of pig (7'15 per unit), whereas in 1839 with hot blast it was only 2 tons 3⅜ cwts. (2.175 per unit). On the other hand during the course of a lawsuit entered upon by Neilson to enforce his patent rights, attempts were made to show that the alleged saving in fuel due to the hot blast was really owing to other causes; and subsequently similar views have been urged, perhaps with not wholly disinterested motives; thus Truran states in his work that at Dowlais the coal consumption per ton of iron was reduced to the following extent between 1791 and 1831 by improvements other than the use of hot blast, cold blast being used throughout, with the following consumption per ton of iron :— [table] Very probably the increased dimensions of furnaces and various other causes all contributed to this large diminution; but it does not therefore follow that substituting hot blast for cold did not diminish the consumption still further. That such a substitution did actually save fuel with ores and coal from South Wales is shown by Dufrenoy’s figures. ] or [9:13:318] from 7 ’ 65 to 2 - 95 per unit of pig iron made, the saving with the Welsh ore similarly represented a reduction in consumption at the Plymouth Works, Merthyr Tydvil, of from 53 to 36 cwts., or from 2 ’ 65 to 1 - 80 per unit of pig iron; so that if the Scotch iron master could compete on equal terms with the Welsh one when cold blast was used, he would have a decided advantage over the latter when hot blast was employed. Accordingly it became a matter of advantage to the Welsh smelter to decry hot blast metal, because its manufacture gave him less profit relatively to smelters in other districts than that of cold blast metal.

Even at this early period, consequently, it was manifest that the advantages derived from a given modification of plant and processes attainable with one class of ore were not necessarily producible with another class; Dufrenoy found that the furnaces of La Guerche, smelting an impure ore containing 42 per cent, of iron, derived little or no benefit by the substitution of hot air for cold; the fuel used in each case amounted to some 25 cwts. per ton, and the only discernible advantage derived from the hot blast was that the resulting iron became grey instead of white, doubtless from the higher temperature of the issuing pig enabling the graphite to separate more readily whilst cooling and solidifying. Iron masters, however, have often failed to appreciate the truth of the proposition that what is advantageous for one ore may not necessarily be so for another; and in consequence very different estimates of the value of new processes and improvements have frequently been made, some condemning them wholly, because under the circumstances of their own particular experience no remarkable advantages accrued; others regarding them as universally beneficial, because under the different conditions of their experience a distinct advantage was gained. The early history of the Bessemer process for producing malleable iron and semi-steel direct from pig by decarbonizing it by blowing air through it affords a good illustration of this point, the process being at first considered by some a complete success, and universally applicable, good metal having been made by them from certain kinds of pig iron (naturally almost free from sulphur and phosphorus); whilst others regarded it as a failure because the less pure pig experimented on by them yielded only an inferior product.

V. Conversion of Cast Iron into Malleable Iron and Steel by Decarbonization.

22. Production of “Malleable Cast IronT— It has been known for upwards of a century and a half that when articles of cast iron of not too great thickness are imbedded in powdered iron oxide (a pure red haematite as free as possible from earthy matters, smithy scales, or some analogous substance) and then kept at a red heat for some days (three or more according to the thickness), a diminution is produced in the amount of carbon contained, so that the cast iron becomes more or less converted into soft iron. When the action is pushed to the extreme all or almost all of the carbon is removed, that in the outer layers disappearing first, but no material diminution in the amount of phosphorus, silicon, sulphur, or manganese is produced;^[26. Analyses by W. A. Miller, quoted in Percy’s Metallurgy (“Iron and Steel,” p. Ill), seem to indicate entire removal of sulphur and partial purification from silicon; thus :— [table] Probably thé cast iron contained irregularly distributed intermixed cinder, the silica of which was counted as silicon. When cast iron plates are slowly oxidized by hot air, according to Tiinner, the silicon diminishes, as it does during refining and in the first stage of the Bessemer process; but recent analyses of ‘ ’ malleable cast iron ’ ’ articles made on the large scale by cementation in haematite powder show that substantially no change whatever occurs in the phosphorus and silicon, and that what alteration there is in the sulphur is rather in the direction of increase (from the presence of sulphur in the fuel) than otherwise. For instance— [table] ] if the heating is not continued long enough to remove all the carbon, that which remains is found in the innermost layers which constitute a core of more or less decarbonized cast iron, with an outer skin of malleable iron. Owing to the non-removal of constituents other than carbon, it is essential to the production of a good malleable metal that a tolerably pure cast iron should be employed in the first instance: unless the articles are thin, so that there is no considerable inner core of cast iron, they will not bear forging so as to weld them, the concussion fracturing the brittle core; on the other hand, the removal of the carbon from the outer skin renders this so much less readily fusible than cast iron that articles so treated (e.g., melting pots and crucibles) will bear a very much higher temperature than cast iron vessels, especially if the core is almost wholly decarbonized; whilst a much greater degree of toughness and power of resisting fracturing influences is communicated. Accordingly this method of preparing cheap small malleable iron articles by casting and subsequently decarbonizing is largely employed, the goods produced being known as “run steel”; whilst even with much larger castings, such as the propellers of screw steamers, the method is often adopted, especially in combination with “case hardening” or conversion of the outermost layer of all into steel by a subsequent process (vide infra). Although the process was described in 1722 by Réaumur, patents for it have been subsequently taken out, e.g., by Lucas in 1804, and Brown and Lennox some half century later.

In order to carry out the conversion of cast iron into malleable iron in this way, the articles to be treated are packed in cast or wrought iron chests in iron oxide powder; the chests are then stacked one above another in a kind of reverberatory furnace, and gradually heated up to a red heat, which is maintained for the requisite time, after which they are annealed by slow cooling; with charcoal pig pretty free from silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus, and with fuel in the furnace free from any large quantity of sulphur, a soft but tough, tenacious, and readily malleable skin is produced; if, however[9:13:319], the heating is continued, for some time after the whole of the carbon originally present has been removed, the articles become brittle, owing to the formation of oxide of iron disseminated through the mass, just as copper, bronze, and analogous substances are rendered brittle through a similar cause. This circumstance, together with the known character of the chemical actions of carbon dioxide on iron and carbon at a red heat, indicates the nature of the processes taking place during the decarbonization: the ferric oxide and the heated air in contact with it first oxidize the carbon in the outermost film to carbon dioxide; this then passes inwards by the process of “occlusion” (gradual solution of gases in solids), and reacts upon the carbon of the next layers in accordance with the equation

CO a + C = 2CO, the carbon oxide thus formed first becoming dissolved in the iron, and subsequently when the iron is saturated therewith gradually diffusing outwards, becoming converted into carbon dioxide as soon as it comes in contact with either the ferric oxide of the packing or the partially oxidized iron of the outer film, which, when free from carbon, reacts on the carbon dioxide, thus

2∕C0 a + icFe = Fe x O 2 , + j∕CO.

In the outermost layers, accordingly, there is always a tendency to the formation of iron oxide in virtue of this reaction, and simultaneously a tendency to the reduction of this oxide by the agency of the carbon oxide which is being formed in the interior layers anti travelling outwards; as long as this latter action keeps the former in check, the accumulation of iron oxide in the outer layers does not take place to such an extent as to deteriorate materially the tenacity of the malleable iron skin; but, when the carbon of the core has been so completely removed that the supply of carbon oxide from the interior almost ceases, the formation and accumulation of iron oxide in the outer layers goes on, rendering them more or less brittle. In the inner layers the removal of carbon by the penetration of the dissolved carbon dioxide and its reaction on the carbon ^is continually progressing, the decarbonization gradually creeping inwards, as it were, until finally the innermost central part becomes decarbonized also. The non-removal of silicon, sulphur, and phosphorus during the process is due simply to the fact that these elements are not acted upon by the occluded carbon dioxide as the carbon is, and consequently not being oxidized cannot be eliminated. The iron oxide used becomes partially reduced during the operation; in order to make it fit for use over again, it is moistened with a solution of sal-ammoniac and exposed to the air in order to rust and so reoxidize it. The whole process is in effect an exact inversion of the chemical changes taking place during the manufacture of blister steel from malleable iron by the process of cementation (see § 32), and differs from the ordinary puddling method for the purification of cast iron in this salient respect that in the latter case the formation of oxide of iron by the effect of heated air, and its direct addition in the form of “fettling,” give rise to the production of a fluxed mass, in which is incorporated a notably larger amount of oxide of iron, which reacts on the carbon, sulphur, silicon, and phosphorus, oxidizing them and converting them into products which are either gaseous and escape (carbon and sulphur dioxides), or are non-metallic and fusible, and hence separate from the iron as a fused slag or cinder.

23. Refining, Fining, and Puddling of Cast Iron.— In order to convert large masses of pig iron into wrought iron, a large variety of methods have been and to some extent are still employed, differing from one another in certain details; they may, however, be classified under two chief heads, viz., those in which the iron is more or less completely fluxed by heat in contact with the solid fuel used, by means of a blast of air on much the same principle as an ordinary smith’s forge, and those in which the treatment of the iron is effected in a chamber separate from that in which the fuel is burnt when solid fuel is employed, or in which gaseous fuel is used in the first instance.

Charcoal Finery. — Prior to the invention of puddling, the conversion of cast into wrought iron was uniformly effected by a process which, though differing markedly in certain details in different countries, yet in all cases essentially consisted of exposure to an oxidizing atmosphere and agitation until practically all the carbon and silicon, &c., is removed. As the iron becomes purer its fusibility lessens, so that ultimately it collects into pasty semi-solid masses which when united together form a “ball,” which is taken out and forged into a “bloom.”

Of the different kinds of finery in use some fourteen principal modifications have been enumerated by Tiinner, divisible into the three classes of “Einmalschmelzerei” (single fusion process), “Waffenschmiede” (Walloon process), and “Aufbrechschmiede” or “Deutscheschmiede” (breaking up process, or German process). Of these most have been virtually out of date for years past; a few, however, are stiff in use, but like the puddling process are rapidly giving way to modern soft steel or ingot iron making processes, the use of malleable weld iron being on the whole rapidly decreasing, at least relatively to that of “steel” and fused iron. A single illustration of one of these processes (termed by Tiinner the English Walloon process) will suffice: as carried out in Sweden in what is somewhat inappropriately termed the Lancashire hearth, this differs slightly from the method as used in South Wales, the chief difference being that in the former case the pigs are melted down and the whole operation finished in the same furnace (saving that the rough blooms produced are reheated in a second furnace for further hammering), whilst in the latter the pig is melted in a separate hearth, in fact is passed through a sort of “tunning out” fire or refinery before it reaches the finery proper; the bed of this latter is “brasqued” or lined with charcoal powder moistened and rammed in, and so forcibly compressed. The tuyeres are directed downwards, so that the blast impinges more or less directly upon the fused metal. The effect of the blast upon the metal broken up and stirred amongst charcoal heaped over it is gradually to cause the formation of iron oxide and silica, with oxidation of the carbon and other impurities, so that finally the metal used becomes changed into two separate substances, viz., a pasty mass of spongy residual purified metal, and a bath of fluid cinder mainly composed of ferrous silicate; the former is ultimately removed as a ball and hammered into rough slabs, and finally after reheating forged into bars, &c.; in the production of “charcoal plates” (for tinplate making), the first rough forged slabs are cut into pieces termed “stamps,” which are then reheated in a reheating furnace termed a “hollow fire” on a mass of the same kind of metal forged into a shovel shape, the blades of the shovel and the mass of stamps piled on it being then forged into a slab, which is virtually a much bigger blade; this is doubled upon itself to ensure equality of the two sides, welded, cut off from the shank, and rolled into bars and plates, &c. In Sweden the metal is usually forged by hammering throughout and not rolled at all. For inferior iron plates this process has been used with the substitution of coke for charcoal and of less pure pig for the better qualities used for the finer plates; but puddled iron has for the most part long superseded that made in a coke-fired finery for general purposes.

The following analyses illustrate the character of Swedish irons produced in the charcoal finery :—
[table]

Refinery.— The term “refining,” although in strictness applicable to all methods by which impure iron is purified, is in practice restricted to one particular operation practised as a preliminary stage in the puddling process, viz., melting pig iron on a hearth such as that shown in figs. 30, 31 (taken [9:13:320] from Bolley’s Technology'), on which the fuel (coke or charcoal) is piled, the combustion being urged by a blast of air, which also partially oxidizes the iron, both as it melts and subsequently; the molten mass when the operation is complete is either run out into moulds, chilled by throwing water on to it (the solidified upper surface being removed as a rough cake), or tapped into a separate similar open furnace or into a puddling furnace, in which the conversion into malleable iron is finished.

The effect of this first treatment is materially to reduce the percentage of total carbon, and almost entirely to remove the silicon present, the latter forming a slag with the oxidized iron together with more or less of the ash of the fuel; when the metal from the refinery is cast, it solidifies as “white iron” destitute or nearly so of graphitoidal carbon. Sometimes the removal of carbon and silicon is accelerated by adding to the fluxing pig mill scales or other tolerably pure readily fusible iron oxide; lime is also sometimes added, with the intention of either partially removing sulphur present in the pig or preventing its further absorption from the fuel.

A modification of the refinery has been introduced by Parry specially applicable to the direct treatment of the molten metal from the blast furnace; the molten pig being tapped straight into the refinery hearth, a jet of superheated steam is made to play upon its surface (the temperature being maintained by an air blast in addition); the oxidation of the iron is then rapidly effected, with evolution of hydrogen from the decomposition of the steam; in this way a notable saving in fuel is said to be effected. In South Wales a coke refinery has been largely employed to partially purify the iron subsequently finished in an ordinary puddling furnace; this refinery or running-out fire is a rectangular hearth with two or more tuyeres delivering blast slanting-wise downwards upon the surface of the fused metal, which is simply introduced as pig piled up on the hearth alternately with layers of coke, melted down, and kept fused with the blast playing on its surface for some time. Owing to the partial removal of silicon, &c., in this previous treatment, the subsequent puddling develops less cinder, and accordingly is sometimes distin- ?;uished as dry puddling ; whilst puddling proper (consisting of the usion in a more or less modified Cort’s furnace of the pig, and its complete treatment therein at one operation) is spoken of as pigboiling, the term “boiling” being derived from the rapid effervescent evolution of carbon oxide from the fused mass at a cei , tain stage, when the iron oxide reacts vigorously on the dissolved carbon.

The following analyses by Rocholl illustrate the changes produced during the refining of Bowling cold blast pig
[table]

Puddling.— In the “dry puddling” process (which, as compared with the “pigboiling” process, is so little used that the generic term “puddling” is much more frequently employed to indicate the latter operation than the former), the iron which has passed through the refinery is placed on the bed of a reverberatory furnace together with a certain amount of mill cinder or other fettling, and melted down in a somewhat oxidizing atmosphere, the result of which is the formation of a fluxed mixture of pig iron and iron oxide; this is well stirred, whilst the flame keeps it fluid, so that the iron oxide gradually reacts on the carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur present, oxidizing them and converting them either into gases which escape, or oxides which by uniting with ferrous oxide form a readily fusible slag. As this process goes on, just as in the charcoal finery, the consistency of the mass alters, the whole thickening firstly to a porridge-like substance and finally to a mixture of pasty solid lumps partly of coherent spongy malleable iron and partly of fluxed slag, mechanically adherent thereto, and dripping from the spongy mass when this is lifted. When the proper consistency is reached the iron is said to “come to nature”; the spongy mass is then raked together with the iron rabble or stirring rod employed, and formed into a rough loosely coherent “ball,” which is worked as described in § 25. The use of the refinery conjoined with the dry puddling process has almost ceased in England; certain brands of Yorkshire iron, however, of high reputation, are still prepared in this way. The superiority of the metal is largely due to the carefulness with which the plates and bars finally prepared are made; the puddled bars are broken into fragments, and each piece carefully examined as to its fracture, the crystalline portions being worked up separately from the fibroid portions which yield the better plates; by piling, reheating, and rolling, &c., the fragments are worked into bars, which are again piled and rolled into plates. Cold blast pig is preferred for certain of these brands.

In the “pigboiling” process, or puddling par excellence as now understood, the main differences as compared with the preceding are that raw pig iron is used in the first instance instead of refined pig, so that the purification takes longer owing to the greater amount of impurity to be removed, and, in consequence of this and of the larger amount of fettling used, a much larger amount of slag or “tap cinder” is formed; in other respects the operation is much the same. The furnace is usually lined in the first instance by melting down and partially oxidizing scrap iron on the bed so as to make a firm foundation; “bulldog” or roasted tap cinder, mainly consisting of ferric oxide and silica, also forms a material largely used, the upper surface being finished off with a layer of a smooth unctuous variety of haematite or with “blue billy” (§ 5) or some other variety of ferric oxide.

In order to facilitate the removal of phosphorus and sulphur in the puddling forge, numerous chemical reagents have been employed incorporated with the mass by stirring. Thus common salt and manganese dioxide have been recommended by Schafhäutl, chlorides of phosphorus, arsenic, and sulphur being said to be formed and volatilized, whilst manganese is communicated to the iron, and by its oxidizing action whilst becoming oxidized itself promotes the purification; moreover it renders the slag more fusible. Henderson employs a mixture of titaniferous iron ore and fluor spar, whereby fluorides of phosphorus, silicon, &c., are said to be evolved. Good results are said to be produced by the employment of fluorides (cryolite or fluor spar) as a flux in puddling. Sherman recommends iodide of potassium; according to Siemens, who carefully tried the Sherman process at the Landore works, no appreciable diminution is produced in the amount of sulphur and phosphorus by the addition of the iodide even in some considerable quantity both during the ordinary process of puddling and in a steel converting furnace, and the same kind of negative result has also been testified to by others, notably Snelus {Journal I. and S. Inst., 1871, ii. 181), and also by Euverte after full trial at Terre Noire. On the other hand, trials of the Henderson process appear to indicate that it causes a more rapid purification than ordinary puddling; thus in experiments made at Blochairn Works, Glasgow, the following percentages of phosphorus were obtained :—
[table]

The resulting cinder contained considerably less phosphorus than that in the pig employed, so that apparently some notable amount was volatilized.
[9:13:321]

Parry has proposed after puddling in the ordinary way to recarbonize the iron by melting it along with coke and a little lime, &c. (to avoid sulphuration as much as possible), in a cupola furnace, and then to puddle a second time; the phosphorus being considered by him to be reduced in each puddling operation to about one-fifth of the original amount, the double puddling would convert even a moderately phosphorized pig into a tolerably pure bar iron. Very good iron has thus been made from highly phosphorized pig on a moderately large scale (some 80 tons).

Appliances for Puddling. The Puddling Forge.— The puddling furnace introduced by Cort in 1784 differs from those in use at the present day only in one essential par ticular, viz., that whereas Cort used a bed of sand on which to run the metal fused previously in a running-out fireplace, the modern furnace as improved by Rogers some half century ago has a bed of iron plates cooled by air spaces underneath and covered with roasted scrap iron or with “bulldog,” on to which the metal is heaped, having been previously refined or not according as the dry puddling or pig boiling process is used. The substitution of iron bottoms and a firm bed for the loose sand effects a great saving in iron through the formation of much less silicious cinder, and a great saving in time on account of repairs to the bed being much less frequently required; moreover, a much greater degree of purification from phosphorus is at the same time brought about.

Fig. 32 represents the general arrangement of a puddling furnace; α is the charging door for the fuel, d the bridge with an air course to cool it, c the bed supported on iron plates with air courses under them, f the exit flue leading to the chimney stack, which is surmounted with a damper k worked by a chain i from within the shed in which the forge is placed; b is the ashpit, g the slag-hole, and e the working door suspended by a chain from a lever with a counter- {>oise attached h, resting on the front side of the furnace roof. A arge number of patterns of puddling furnaces differing one from the other in details have been constructed by various inventors; the limits of the present article as to length forbid that these should be minutely discussed.

Instead of using solid coal or coke as fuel for the puddling forge, gas is equally applicable, i.e., such as is described in § 10. In order to apply at will an oxidizing or a reducing atmosphere, it is only requisite to regulate the supply of air (usually hot blast) to the reverberatory furnace in which the gas is used. In Silesia gas puddling furnaces have been long in use, consisting of producers in which coal is burnt by means of a number of small jets of air forced in at the base of a square brick chamber some 5 feet in height, the top of the chamber being level with the bridge of an ordinary reverberatory furnace, the producer taking the place of the firegrate. In this way a mixture of nitrogen and carbon oxide with more or less hydrogen and carburetted hydrogens from the distillation of the coal results, the combustion of which in the reverberatory is effected by blowing a series of jets of heated air from a row of tuyeres arranged horizontally, or from a long narrow horizontal slitshaped tuyere, across the issuing gases so as to form something like a gigantic blow-pipe, or series of parallel blow-pipe flames, which are somewhat inclined downwards so as to impinge on the substances in the bed of the furnace. Similar arrangements have been adopted elsewhere; thus in Carinthia gas-fired puddling furnaces are in use where wood is the fuel, the producer and furnace proper adjoining one another, and the combustion of the gas being completed in the furnace by a jet of blast from a tuyere inclining somewhat downwards; the blast is moderately heated by being made to circulate through flues under the furnace bed, thus also cooling the brickwork; the pigs to be puddled are previously heated up to near their fusing point by the waste gases from a previous operation, being placed in a chamber just beyond the hearth. The waste gases have also been employed to heat the air blast by placing a pistolpipe or other equivalent kind of stove between the furnace and the chimney. Several furnaces for thus utilizing the waste heat have been introduced, in England in particular; J. Head describes under the name of the “Newport furnace” a somewhat analogous arrangement, a dry steam jet being used in connexion with the airblast; a great diminution in consumption of fuel is thus said to be produced {Journal I. and S. Inst., 1872, p. 220).

The Siemens regenerative furnace as applied to puddling consists essentially of a furnace fired by the gases from a Siemens gas producer heated (along with the air requisite to burn them) by means of Siemens regenerators (§ 10). The chief difference between this form of furnace, represented by fig. 33, and the Carinthian gas furnaces is that the flame does not enter at one end and issue at the other, but leaves the furnace at the same end as that at which it enters, circulating in the furnace, and thereby leaving the other end free for access by means of an ordinary door. According to Siemens the loss of weight between pig and puddled bar did not exceed 2 per cent, on an average of six months’ continuous working, whilst the consumption of coal (including the reheating furnace) was 30 Cλvts. 3 qrs. 8 lb per ton of finished wire rod (3 cwts. of ordinary fettling being used per ton of iron). Modifications of the Siemens furnace have been adopted in various iron-works differing more or less in detail, but not greatly in general principle; thus the Ponsard furnace (§ 40) and the Swindell furnace mainly differ in having the producer placed close to the furnace so that the gases are used directly without passing through the regenerators, which are only used to heat the air. The total fuel used in a Swindell puddling furnace in a large American works on a four months’ average was 2024⅛ lb of slack per ton of yield in iron (2240 lb), or 0 ’ 904 per unit of iron; the furnace, however, was not at work at night, so that a greater consumption of fuel was occasioned than would have been with double shifts of workmen. Kosmann has made a careful comparison {ΡreussicherZeitschr.f. Berg-, Hütten-, und Salinenwesen, 1870, 145) between the effects and relative economy of puddling in the ordinary manner and in a Siemens regenerative gas puddling furnace, arriving at the conclusion that the latter is preferable in all cases where an extremely high heat is required, and where the fuel is of bad quality and unsuited for use in the ordinary way, or when a fixed temperature and particular constant quality of flame are required for any length of time. If, however, these conditions are not required, there is little advantage in the Siemens furnace over the ordinary one, whilst the latter admits of waste heat being utilized for heating boilers, &c. The waste of iron is nearly equal in the two cases, the ordinary furnace being slightly at a disadvantage; thus the cinder contained

Descriptions of the costand working of Siemens puddling turnaces in several iron-works are given by the Puddling Committee of the Iron and Steel Institute (<7owraαZ, 1872, p. 123).

Besides the gases generated from coal, various other kinds of fuel for puddling furnaces are sometimes employed; thus petroleum and coal tar have been used in American works, as also has the natural gas from the Pennsylvanian oil wells, and that produced by partially burning damp sawdust (see § 10).

24. Machinery for Saving Labour in Puddling.— In order to diminish the amount of laborious and exhausting work performed by the puddler, various mechanical contri vances have been introduced from time to time, mostly consisting of an ordinary rabble or some similar stirrer to which motion is communicated by machinery, in such a way as to move it (with some amount of guidance on the part of a workman) more or less in the same way as the puddler would use it. Fig. 34 represents one of this class of mechanical rabbles known as Withamjs machine rabble applied to a double puddling furnace. Dormoy ’ s rabble (figs. 35, 36) differs from others of this class in being worked by rotation like a hair-brushing machine; the tool being made to revolve very rapidly (300 to 500 turns per minute for white iron and 800 to 1000 for grey pig) gives the metal such an impulse that it gyrates horizontally round the bed, continually renewing the surface in contact with the atmosphere; this is further aided by making the end of the rabble to carry a disk, which is replaced by a short twisted point when the metal comes to nature; only for the final balling is a hand-worked rabble requisite. According to Paget {Journal I. and 8. Inst., 1872, 338) one fettling serves for forty charges worked in this way; an increase of 30 per cent, in the yield is effected, with an expenditure of only 0 ’ 552 parts of coal perunit of wrought iron made (11 ’ 4 cwts. per ton); the puddler is but little fatigued, although charges are worked off much more rapidly, whilst sulphur and phosphorus are so well eliminated that inferior brands of pig produce iron equal to good charcoal iron. Numerous other mechanical rabbles and analogous appliances have been introduced by various inventors; reports on the working of several of these (Witham’s, Griffith’s, Stoker’s, Wilson’s, &c.), and on the construction and performance of several kinds of puddling furnace, are given by the Puddling Committee of the Iron and Steel Institute in the Journal, 1872; also of the Carron-Dormoy furnace and mechanical rabble, ibid., 1876, 109.

Many attempts were made prior to 1869, chiefly by Walker and Warren, Maudsley, Yates, Tooth, and Menelaus, to effect puddling by a revolving furnace rotated by machinery so as to cause the requisite intermixture of [9:13:323] pig, fettling, and slag mechanically; Bessemer proposed to employ an ovoid oscillating chamber fired by flame passing in through a hollow trunnion on one side and escaping similarly on the other side, whilst Oestlund (of Sweden) invented a rotating globular vessel into which the flame was directed from the front. Practically none of these machines ever came much into use. A considerable measure of success, however, has attended the improved form of rotary puddling furnace invented by Danks of Cincinnati, and represented in fig. 37.

The fuel is burnt in an ordinary fireplace, a blast B being admitted under the bars and another over them A, level with the firing hole, so that by regulating the two streams of air the atmosphere can be kept reducing or oxidizing at will. A circular chamber or drum 0 is supported on massive friction rollers and arranged so that its axis is about level with the top of the bridge; at the other end is a movable terminal shaped like the frustum of a cone D, supported by chains or rods from a crane so that it can be swung on one side if required, thus serving as a door; this is connected by a lateral tube with the flue; a small orifice E closed by a stopper allows the interior of the furnace to be viewed when at work. The movable end being swung on one side and the blast turned off, the pigs are introduced at the end, and the terminal replaced; on turning on the blast and causing the drum to rotate slowly the pig is melted and incorporated with the fettling, &c., by the rotation; motion is communicated by means of a large external cog wheel F gearing into a pinion. Through a small cinder hole G the fluid slag is drawn off. The main difficulty experienced by previous inventors was to obtain a furnace lining that would last for any length of time, silicious bricks and analogous substances being used by them; this difficulty was overcome by Danks in the following way. The iron external drum is cased inside with firebrick, or preferably a cement composed of crashed ore and lime; a fusible iron ore such as hammer slag or mill scale is then introduced and melted down, the drum being slowly rotated; the rotation being stopped, the melted mass collects as a pool at the lowest level; large irregular lumps of an infusible ore (American iron mountain ore in preference, or Marbella lumps when this is not attainable) are then thrown into the pool; the cooling effect of these soon sets the liquid mass, which then acts as a cement, binding the lumps to the lining. This operation is repeated several times, so that finally the whole inside is lined, the pool being formed in a new place each time. The performance of the Danks puddler was very fully investigated a few years ago by a special commission of the Iron and Steel Institute, whose various reports are given in the Journal of the I. and S. Inst, for 1872 (see also ibid., 1871, i. 258); the general results of the experiments being that the production from the rotator is several times that from a hand furnace using the same pig, and that a larger yield of iron is obtained, more being in fact taken out of the furnace than is put in as pig, the surplus arising from the reduction of the fettling; moreover, with suitable fettling the quality of iron produced is always at least equal to that yielded by the hand furnace, and is usually much superior owing to the more complete elimination of phosphorus due to the less “acid” nature of the slag; the consumption of fuel per ton of iron made is much about the same, but usually somewhat less with the rotator than with the hand furnace; thus whilst something like 21⅜ cwts. of pig were required to give a ton of wrought iron by the hand process, slightly less than 18f sufficed with the Danks furnace; i.e., 100 parts of wrought iron were obtained from 107 '5 and from 93 ’ 6 parts of pig in the two processes respectively. It is to be noticed, however, that further practical experience has not altogether confirmed the results of the commission, and that so far as England is concerned the advantages derived from mechanical puddling by the Danks machine (and also by others subsequently introduced) have not proved as great in actual practice as the success of the machine in America at first seemed to indicate would be the case in other countries^

In order to avoid the damage done to the lining by introducing solid pigs, Wood proposes to granulate the iron by means of a machine somewhat analogous to his slag granulator (§ 17), whilst fusion of the pigs in a separate furnace or cupola has also been often employed, the molten metal being then tapped into the rotary puddler.

A large number of modifications of Danks’s furnace and many other more or less analogous rotating arrangements for puddling have been subsequently constructed by various inventors; thus Williams (Pittsburg, United States) makes the rotating chamber of the Danks furnace to be separated from the combustion chamber a little way, the flame being led in through a movable flue analogous to that at the chimney end, so that access to both ends of the rotator is possible.^[27. See Iron, vol. x. p. 456, 1877, from the Metallurgical Review. ] Amongst other rotating puddling furnaces may be noticed the following.

Seller's Furnace.— In this arrangement the flame does not pass through the chamber to the chimney, but turns back on itself as [9:13:324] in the Siemens puddling furnace (fig. 33). The far end is cooled by water or steam; the fuel employed is gaseous, the generator being immediately in front of the furnace; mechanical arrangements of special character are also applied for the purpose of charging and discharging the furnaces. The rotating chamber rests on friction wheels which are made to turn by an engine instead of having an external cog wheel affixed to the drum itself as in Danks’s machine. For drawings of the machine and further details see Iron, vol. x. p. 738.

Spencer's rotating furnace (fig. 38) is shaped like a rhombus reversing on a horizontal axis, supported at the end by disks perpendicular to the axis of rotation; the transverse vertical section is square, two sides being parallel to the axis, the other two, though parallel to each other, being pitched slightly diagonal, so that in revolving a throw is communicated to the charge from bridge to Hue during one half of the revolution, and vice versa during the other half. The flat sides allow the rotator to be readily fettled; they are made of troughs filled with molten tap cinder, the ends being made up of bricks also of cast tap cinder, the whole put together and cemented with molten tap; in one side is the door for removing the ball when it has come to nature. The pig is melted in a cupola before running in; in about five minutes the boil commences, and it lasts about ten minutes, the operation being finished in other ten, when the ball is extracted, and quickly removed on a bogie to the hammer and rolls.

Crampton's furnace has a similar construction, with the additional modification that the flame is produced by coal dust and air (§ 10) instead of solid fuel (fig. 39). A is the revolving chamber supported on friction rollers C, C; B is the refractory lining, and D a movable flue piece, supported upon a pivot D' so as to wheel round when required into the position indicated by the dotted lines; it is kept in place against the furnace by the screws d, d when the operation is proceeding. By means of the injecting pipe G a jet of mixed air and small coal is blown into the furnace; this pipe is adjustable so that the flame can be directed into the furnace in different ways as required; when a number of furnaces are worked together from one central air and coal reservoir, each one is fed by a pipe G' radiating from the reservoir. By means of little doors ∕,∕ different parts of the opening F in the flue piece through which the jet enters can be closed at will. A water jacket surrounds the rotator fed through the two-way cock H with a stream of water circulating as indicated by the arrows entering by the pipe I, and passing through the jacket JJKLL to the exit pipe N, after which it passes to the flue piece D (by means of a flexible tube), and there circulates through another analogous jacket, finally emerging by a pipe and running into a chamber d' at the base of the pivot and thence to the drain. The wearing joints 0, 0 of the furnace and flue which rub together are iron rings, directly in contact with the water (forming the ends of the jackets); these are renewable when required. In fettling the furnace either oxide of iron bricks moulded to fit the furnace are built in and then baked in situ, and fettled in much the same way as Danks’s furnace (viz., melting fusible ores or cinder, and throwing in irregular lumps of ore, splashing the cinder over the far end in so doing so as to cover it); or hammer slag, &c., is melted on the bare iron casing, and lumps of ore are thrown into the fused substance so as to be thereby cemented to the casing; or a thin firebrick lining maybe built in and the fettling then put on. Owing to the cooling action of the water-jacket when the furnaceis in use, the bricks are never melted down, and even a fluid cinder applied directly to the iron plates in the first instance without bricks of any kind is completely prevented from fluxing; in the same way the far end gets spontaneously fettled by the consolidation of the cinder splashed against it. According to Crampton’s description of the furnace (from which the above account is abridged— Journal I. and S. Inst., 1874, 384), in puddling 130 cwts. of pig 147J cwts. of hammered iron were ultimately produced, with an expenditure of 70 cwts. of coal, i.e., the wrought iron was 113 - 5 per cent, of the pig used, and the coal employed was 47 ‘3 per cent, of the wrought iron made (or 9 ’ 46 cwts. per ton); in another case, with smaller charges, the coal consumption was70 ’ l per cent, of the wrought iron (14 - 02 cwts. per ton), which amounted to 114 ‘5 of the pig used. Pig containing nearly one per cent, of phosphorus yielded wrought iron containing only traces.

Hoxνson and Thomas's Rotary Machine.— The chamber is made up of two cones of wrought iron fixed base to base, lined with bricks made of ferric oxide and previously well-baked, ilmenite or haematite or any refractory ore being suitable. The fireplace communicates with an annular space surrounding the neck of the chamber nearest to it by a tube, so that any air which would otherwise be drawn in by the draught at the opening between the grate bridge and revolver is drawn over to the fire and not into the chamber. In order to withdraw the ball, and introduce anew charge, the revolver is mounted on a carriage (supporting the friction rollers), so that by running the carriage backwards or forwards, in a direction perpendicular to the axis, access is had to the interior through the ends, or the chamber is again put into position.

Riley and Henley's Furnace. — This furnace has a bowl-shaped bed which revolves on a vertical axis by machinery, the sides and roof being fixed; when the pig is introduced and melted down, the workman inserts his rabble at the working door, and has simply to hold it in position to stir up the molten mass, this being facilitated by a projecting stud being fixed to the rabble and fitting into a cavity in the doorplate. When the metal begins to come to nature, it is worked with a differently shaped tool something like a ploughshare in shape; this, being pressed against the bottom, causes the plastic mass to roll over the plough like a small cascade; finally the [9:13:325] iron is balled up, the quantity worked at once being sufficient to form several balls. Ehremverth's and Alleyne's furnaces are very similar in construction and mode of use; in the latter the axis is hollow, containing a water pipe by means of which jets of water are made to play on the under surface of the upper bottom (the bottom being double), the water flowing away again through the hollow shaft; in a later modification, a mechanical rabble capable of rotary or reciprocating motion is also attached.

Pernot Puddling Furnace. —--This furnace essentially differs from the preceding ones only in that, while the revolving hearth rotates on an axis not perfectly vertical (as also previously used by Maudes-

ley), the axis is mounted on a carriage, so that when required for repairs the whole hearth can be withdrawn. Fig. 62 represents the furnace with this modification that, instead of an ordinary fireplace being employed, a Siemens regenerator and Siemens gas producer are used in connexion with the Pernot hearth, the arrangement being intended for steel melting by the Siemens-Martin process rather than for puddling (see § 40). According to Petin {Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1874, 143) the fuel consumption with the Pernot hearth as compared with the ordinary puddling furnace is considerably less (the fuel being burnt in the same kind of fireplace in each case), whilst the loss in puddling is also less; thus per unit of wrought iron the following figures were obtained during the puddling of nearly 300 tons of fine iron and 50 tons of ordinary iron (leaving out of account the saving of labour) :—
[table]

Further experience has confirmed these results to a considerable extent; thus the results of a year’s working at Ougrée indicates that a yield of 1 part of puddle bars is obtained with a consumption of between l - 09 and l ’ 10 of the white Ougrée pig and O ’ 75 to 0’80 parts of coal, or 0 Ό4 less of pig and 0 ’ 20 less of coal than is consumed with the ordinary puddling furnaces in use there.

The Godfrey and Howson Puddling Furnace. — Like the Pernot furnace, this has a pan-shaped hearth rotating upon an oblique axis; the obliquity of this can be adjusted to any required angle within certain limits, so as to admit of the ball being tilted out when the operation is over, the furnace bed having both a rotary and a tilting movement. The source of heat is like that of a Crampton’s furnace, with this difference that instead of using coal dust a gas and air jet like a compound blowpipe of enormous magnitude is employed. Details of the construction and working are given in the Journal I. and S. Inst., 1877, p. 416; when the pig iron is previously melted in a cupola, it is said that a consumption of 2500 cubic feet suffices to puddle a ton of metal, this amount representing only about 5 cwts. of coal, the coke of which is not consumed, and is consequently available for heating purposes.

It deserves notice that in 1858 Oestlund invented in Sweden a revolving furnace almost identical in principle and mode of working with the Godfrey and Howson furnace of some eighteen years later date; Jordan gives a description of this and some other Swedish early inventions in the same direction {Revue Universelle des Mines, tom. iii. No. 1; see also Iron, 1878, vol. xi. pp. 740 and 772).

The following analyses,by Louis illustrate the changes produced during the puddling by hand of Nova Scotia pig :—
[table]

The following analyses indicate the character of various kinds of cinder produced during puddling, reheating, &c.
[table]

According to the care bestowed by the operator, and the nature of the fettling and other circumstances, the amount of silicon, [9:13:326] sulphur, and phosphorus in the puddle bars obtained from a given kind of pig will vary. Many of the machines for puddling above mentioned, and of the more or less analogous ones invented by Menessier Jones, Gidlow and Abbott, Bouvart, and others, are reported by their inventors to answer far better in this respect than ordinary hand-puddling furnaces, in particular as regards the removal of phosphorus; so that with Cleveland pig, for instance, containing 1 , 5 to2 ’ 0 percent, of that element, whilst the hand-puddle bars usually contain about 0 ’ 5 per cent, of phosphorus, only 0 ’ 2 and 0 ’ l per cent, and even less is contained in the machine-puddled metal.

This result has been traced in some instances to the use of fettling materials containing but little silica; the production of a comparatively non-silicious cinder greatly facilitates the oxidation and removal of phosphorus (as in the “basic” Bessemer process,— § 37); whilst, conversely, well-puddled iron, if left in contact with a highly silicious cinder, is capable of removing phosphorus therefrom and taking it up again. Based on this principle, several processes have been proposed for more or less completely dephosphorizing pig iron either during puddling or previously thereto; among them may be mentioned the following.

Bell ’ s Processes.— Lowthian Bell has proposed to desiliconize the pig by blowing Tor a few minutes in a Bessemer converter, and then to transfer to a puddling furnace and finish the operation therein so as also to eliminate phosphorus; in case the metal contains so much phosphorus as to come to nature before a sufficient amount of that impurity is removed, spiegeleisen or other carbonized iron free from phosphorus is added to the partially blown metal, so as to prolong the operation of puddling, and consequently to enable a larger amount of phosphorus to be removed; or the too rapid expulsion of the carbon may be prevented by blowing into the converter along with the blast carbonaceous matter, such as ground coke or charcoal, &c. Partially refined metal thus prepared charged into the furnace in the fluid state causes much less injury to the lining than ordinary pigs, especially when used solid, and consequently with a good deal of sand adherent to them; and the process has the additional advantage of diminishing the time during which the furnace is required for each puddling heat, so that the yield per furnace is increased, whilst the quality of themetai is also improved; thus when Cleveland pig was treated by blowing for five minutes in a Bessemer converter, and the fluid metal then puddled, the phosphorus in the final product was reduced to 0 ’ 3 per cent., whereas when puddled in the ordinary way it amounted to 0 , 5 per cent, and upwards.

The same result as regards partial purification of the pig irou can also be produced in a more simple way and to a greater extent by “washing” molten pig iron with iron oxide (ore, cinder, &c.) in a fused state, the two being agitated together at a temperature sufficiently low to prevent the iron from being heated much above its fusing point; under these circumstances the greater portion of ⅛e phosphorus present is oxidized and removed, whilst only a fraction of the carbon is oxidized, although at higher temperatures the carbon is rapidly oxidized; to effect this either a rotating or an oscillating puddling furnace can be employed, or preferably a special arrangement consisting of a trough of boiler plate closed at the ends and covered with a brick arch and lined with purple ore at the bottom and sides; the trough rests on a horizontal axis, so that it can oscillate like the beam of an engine; hence any material placed inside is continually rolled or made to flow from one end to the other and back by the oscillation. The trough is about 12 feet long, 3 wide, and 3 high; the interior being red hot and the oxide introduced (either fluid or sufficiently hot to melt when in contact with fused pig iron), the pig is run in, and oscillation kept up for about ten minutes, when the partially purified metal is tapped out and puddled in the ordinary way; during the oscillation the metal and oxide travel altogether some 700 to 900 feet backwards and forwards from one end to the other. In this way a pig containing much phosphorus is almost wholly dephosphorized, as, for example, in the following instance.
[table]

Krupp's process (Narjds process') for dephosphorizing iron is in principle very much the same as Bell’s method, the phosphorus being oxidized by fused iron oxide, only at a much higher temperature than that used by Bell. Wedding describes the process as carried out at Essen thus: the pig is melted in a 13 foot cupola with coke (taking an hour and a half), and is then tapped into a modified Pernot hearth (§ 40) covered with a layer of fluxed ore almost a foot thick, melted on at a very high temperature; before every heat from 1500 to 1700 fi> of ore, heated until sintered, are added before the iron is tapped from the cupola. At first the furnace is made to revolve twice only in a minute, but later the speed is increased to five revolutions per minute. In from five to ten minutes the phosphorus is almost completely removed, the point when this is the case being indicated by the formation of jets of carbon oxide; prior to the formation of these, the carbon percentage is barely altered, although the phosphorus is acted upon rapidly. Finkiner gives the following analyses of various specimens of metal thus treated :—
[table]

Mangani fetous ores are employed in preference, the presence of manganese being said to increase the rate of removal of phosphorus whilst diminishing that of carbon. Both in Europe and America this method has been employed on the large manufacturing scale with considerable success, especially for the preparation and purification of metal for Siemens-Martin steel.

Hαmοir's process as carried out at Mauberge (France) essentially consisted in the removal of silicon, &c., by blowing air through the molten pig before puddling it in the ordinary way; according to Deby an economy of 10 per cent, of fuel was thus occasioned, with an increase of 10 per cent, in daily output (10 heats being worked instead of 9), the quality of the metal being also improved.

Smyth has proposed to refine pig iron by blowing in a Bessemer converter or analogous specially constructed vessel with a blast containing petroleum disseminated through it, together with hydrochloric acid or caustic soda, these chemicals being introduced in a special piece of apparatus or “generator” somewhat analogous to an ordinary spray producer, and the partially refined metal being subsequently puddled in the usual way. A number of experiments made by Maynard at Gorton (near Manchester) indicated that the advantages of the process were hardly in proportion to the extra cost thereby entailed so far as the purifying action is concerned; but there is an advantage in the use of petroleum as a means of obtaining the high temperature in the converter or “receiver” used by Smyth requisite to keep the blown metal in fusion and prevent “skulls” forming when it is run out into a casting ladle, in cases where the iron has not the requisite amount of silicon present to enable it to generate this heat with the use of air alone (see § 27).

Ρetlitt ’ s process for dephosphorizing pig iron, strictly speaking, is in no way a modification of the ordinary methods of mechanical puddling, being more akin to the “basic” dephosphorization method (§ 37). Essentially it consists of the use of a blast carrying with it into the Bessemer converter iron oxide particles, the object being to bring iron oxide into intimate contact with the fused metal, and thus make the slag formed in the body of the iron “basic” ab initio, instead of its being mainly silicate, as in the ordinary process. According to the inventor it is not necessary, in order to produce steel, to employ spiegeleisen, nor to alter the mode of lining with ganister in any way; he gives the following analyses :—
[table]
[9:13:327]

As yet the process does not seem to have attracted the attention, or to have produced the results, that were expected of it some two or three years back.

Eaton’s Process {Drown’s Process).— In connexion with the history of the dephosphorization of pig iron, and its conversion into steel, the experiments of Eaton (of Brooklyn, N. Y. ) are of interest; in 1860 he patented the production of steel by the fusion together of cast iron and alkaline carbonates or by the exposure of the cast iron to the decarbonizing and purifying action of these salts in a fused state. No practical use seems to have been made of the process. Recently the subject has been investigated by Drown, who finds that cast iron plates immersed in melted sodium carbonate for several days become converted into malleable iron to a greater or lesser depth by a process substantially the same as that occurring when iron oxide is used as the “cementing” agent (§ 22), so far as the removal of carbon is concerned, but differing in that silicon and phosphorus are also largely oxidized and removed. Thus the following analyses represent the purifying effect of a seven days’ treatment of a bar of pig iron :—
[table]

25. Machinery and Appliances employed in the Manufacture of Malleable Iron.— When a ball has been prepared in the puddling furnace, it consists of a loosely coherent spongy mass of iron of doughy consistency with fluid slag filling up all the interstices and dripping from it. The first thing to be done with it is to hammer or squeeze it into a somewhat more compact mass or bloom, the fluid slag being thus to a considerable extent removed; the mass is then further hammered or rolled into rough bars, by which time it has so far cooled down that before it can be further manipulated it must be again heated up to welding heat; previously to this heating it is cut up into slips which are “piled” on one another and “fagoted” together with iron wire, and after being heated up again are hammered into a bloom and rolled or otherwise worked into bars, plates, rods, &c., as required. For very coarse bars piling and reheating is not always necessary; but for the better qualities of “merchant iron” these operations are carefully gone through, often more than once; the size of the piles, the way in which the separate portions are arranged in them, and the mode of rolling, &c., depending on the form ultimately desired; thus the arrangement is somewhat different when ψ iron is intended to be made from that adopted for plates, and so on; the pile being made in the former case pyramidal or somewhat ∣ shaped, in the latter of rectangular section.

Formerly the balls were squeezed by an “alligator” or “crocodile” squeezer such as that represented in fig. 40, and were then “shingled” by shingling hammers, such as the “tilt” hammer (where the hammer forms a lever with the fulcrum in the middle, a cam pressing upon one end serving to depress that end and raise the other which carries the head) and the “helve” hammer (where the fulcrum is at one end, the lifting cam being at the other, and the hammer head between the two, as near the cam as possible, fig. 41); these arrangements were usually worked by water-power. With the increased use of steam-power more powerful squeezers were employed. Fig. 42 represents Brown’s revolving squeezer, the ball being made to pass between two rotating cams which flatten it out, and subsequently between the second of these and a third which carries the operation further; in more powerful machines of the kind a larger number of cams still is employed. Fig. 43 represents another form of rotary squeezer, in which, by the friction of the revolving inner wheel C (studded with blunt projecting teeth) the ball D is urged onwards from A where it enters to E where it leaves, and is consequently flattened out and squeezed by the pressure between C and the outer circle BB. The use of the steam hammer, however, has now largely superseded these arrangements for the produce of handpuddling furnaces; for larger masses hydraulic squeezers are often used; thus Siemens employs an hydraulic compressor in which three or more hydraulic rams simultaneously advance horizontally to the ball in radial directions, the ball being mounted on a turntable, so that when the rams retire it can be shifted round so as to present fresh surface to the rams; after lateral compression, a vertical ram or screw descends upon the ball so as to compress it in a new direction. For the large balls obtained in tue Danks furnace, &c., a powerful squeezer is used, in principle analogous to Brown’s (fig. 42), having two rollers at the base revolving in the same direction, and a large eccentric or cam geared to them and also revolving in the same direction, the end being hammered up by a horizontal steam hammer when the pressure forces the metal outwards.

Fig. 44 represents a single-acting hammer after Nasmyth’s construction (Cave’s modification), in which the cylinder is fixed and the [9:13:328] piston movable; and fig. 45 indicates a form of Condie’s hammer^[28. Taken from Bolley’s Handbuch, vol. vii., part 2, by Dr C. Stolzel. ] which has the piston fixed and the cylinder movable; in each case the movable part works vertically and carries a heavy hammer head at the lower end, underneath which is a massive anvil resting on a solid foundation. In the case of single-acting hammers, the steam pressure is only employed to lift the hammer head, the fall being simply that due to gravity; much greater force of impact is gained in double-acting hammers, where the steam is admitted on each side of the piston alternately, in the one case lifting the head as with the single-acting hammer, in the other adding to the force of gravitation by its pressure. By suitably working the valves the blow maybe modified or arrested at any desired stage; a cushion of steam being left underneath the piston by closing the exhaust valve before the stroke is complete, the force of the blow is deadened; so that a variable amount of impact can be imparted, it being possible for an expert hammerman to crack a nut without injuring the kernel, and at the next stroke to exert the full power of the machine. It is this adaptability that renders the steam hammer preferable to the old helve and tilt hammers, the blows from which could not be readily modified during the shingling of a given ball; whilst the ball is excessively pasty and spongy immediately after taking from the puddling furnace, comparatively light blows suffice to shape it into a bloom, the mass being dexterously turned about on the anvil by means of suitable tongs during the forging; the force of the blow is then greatly increased so fas to squirt out the fused slag on all sides in a shower at each stroke, and forge the bloom into a compact mass; in this way the steam hammer acts as both squeezer and helve hammer combined. Hammer blocks or “tups” of from 1 to 3 tons weight usually suffice for ordinary puddling furnace work, and lighter ones still for various kinds of smelting and forging work; but when large masses have to be forged for special purposes, e.g., thick armour plates, large crankshafts, coils for large guns, jfcc., much heavier tups are used, weighing many tons; thus in Krupp’s works a 50-ton hammer is in use with a 10-foot stroke, the anvil weighing upwards of 180 tons, whilst at Creusot an 80-ton hammer with a fall of 5 metres (about 16 feet) is employed. The striking faces of both anvil and tup are usually removable, sliding sideways by dovetails into the body of the tup and the anvil block respectively. For certain classes of work curved faces are employed, instead of plain ones; so that a roughly cylindrical bar can be forged by appropriate manipulation.

A duplex horizontal modification of the vertical steam hammer is sometimes used (Ramsbottom’s hammer), consisting of two opposed hammer blocks running on wheels or rollers and meeting one another; the forging being placed between the two is struck by both simultaneously. In one form of this double horizontal hammer the two tups are actuated by the same piston, each being attached thereto by a link rod so that both necessarily approach and recede at equal ratio; in another form two pistons are employed, the steam valves of each being worked simultaneously by the controlling lever. For forging small articles such as bolts, screws, &c., special machines are in use, striking a large number of blows per minute, the hammer heads and anvil blocks being moulded or curved into the appropriate forms so as virtually to form dies; the blows are usually struck by means of cams lifting the hammersand bending strong springs which force the hammer back when the-cams release them. See also Hammer, vol. xi. p. 425.

For bending into shape large masses of metal such as thick armour plates that have to be curved to the ship’s side, powerful hydraulic presses are employed; by means of the same appliances large weldings of metal that cannot readily be hammered on account of the shape can be readily made; thus, for welding the spokes and tyres of iron and steel wheels and the like operations, hydraulic forging, squeezing, welding, and bending machines are found to be eminently satisfactory. Crank axles thus bent are said to be stronger than ordinary forged ones.

Polling Hills.— After the bloom has been forged more or less into shape by the steam hammers, it is passed between [9:13:329] a pair of stout cast iron rollers, usually with roughened surfaces, which are made to revolve synchronously but in opposite directions by suitable gearing; the opposed faces of the rolls which meet the bloom between them are consequently moving in the same direction; by these “roughing rolls” the bloom is squeezed out into a rough irregular long plate or slab, much as a lump of dough is by a cook’s rolling pin; this is passed through another pair of rolls with smoother surfaces, which draw the mass out into a thinner bar or slab. Instead of having the two sets of rolls arranged one in front of the other, they are often placed one above the other; the bar after passing in one direction between one pair is returned again through the other pair. Instead of four roller's, only three are generally used (forming a “three-high train ”), the bar passing above the middle one whilst travelling in one direction and below it when passing the reverse way. The “puddle bar” or “muck bar” thus obtained in the form of elongated slabs of from 4 to 18 inches wide, and half an inch to 2 inches thick, according to the size to which it has been reduced, is then cut up into lengths of some few feet, several of which are piled one on the other, reheated, and rolled down again into another bar or slab of superior quality (No. 2).

For thick plates the pile is made much heavier than for thinner bars; two puddle bar wide slabs are used for the top and bottom of the pile, between which are arranged thinner bars, either of puddle bar or No. 2; the pile being heated to a welding heat is first passed between roughed rolls to consolidate it, then through other pairs of smooth rolls in succession, the space between each pair being successively less and less so as to elongate the bar and diminish its section at each passage, much as wire is in wire drawing; this is usually effected by grooving the rollers used for the last few rolling stages so that the rolls are almost in contact with one another saving where grooved. Fig. 46 illustrates two kinds of successions of grooves used for rectangular bars in a “two-

high” train, and fig. 47 those for rails in a “three-high” train on A. Thomas’s system. The bars are turned one quarter round at each passage, so that the pressure may be exerted alternately compressing and extending each component layer of bars in the pile, and thus developing a more uniform texture. Sometimes, in reducing the pile to the larger-sized bar which is ultimately sent through the “finishing train” of grooved rolls, a combination set of rolls is employed, consisting of one horizontal pair of rolls and one vertical pair just behind it, so that the mass is compressed both laterally and vertically simultaneously (fig. 48). The “housings,” or stout cast-iron supports for the rollers, are arranged with a slot so that the gunmetal bearings for the axles of the rollers can be raised or lowered by means of a powerful adjusting screw, and in this way the distance between the rolls is regulated, and consequently the thickness of the bar rolled out. In order to facilitate this adjustment the bearings of the upper roller are sometimes attached to a frame with a counterpoise, and connected with a hydraulic ram so as at will to bring the movable roll nearer to or further from the other; in this way one pair of rollers can be made to do the work of several rectangular grooves. Sometimes two pairs of horizontal rolls are arranged one just in front of the other, so that the size of the bar passing from the hinder pair is still further reduced by passing through the front pair, which are a little closer together and revolve more rapidly. When very thick plates are rolled, the direction of rotation of the rolls is reversed instead of returning the plate back again, special ‘ t reversing engines” being used for the purpose. For special kinds of work, such as rolling taper iron (e.g., the movable tongues of railway “points”), a peculiar lifting arrangement is applied to the upper roll, so that as the metal passes between the distance apart is varied. When an hydraul ic ram is employed to vary the distance apart of the rollers, this is simply effected by adjusting the ram so that the distance apart of the rolls is the minimum requisite, and opening a small discharge valve for the water when the bar is introduced; as the bar passes through, the water is ejected in a regular stream through the discharge valve, the rate being so adjusted that as the bar travels through the distance apart of the rolls gradually increases; by closing the valve the distance apart remains constant, so that after rolling a taper end the rest of the bar can be rolled of uniform section. With a “two-high” [9:13:330] train not reversed at each successive passage, the bar is lifted by hand or otherwise to the top of the top roller, which then guides it back to the side from which it started, after which it is put through the next groove, and so on; this causes loss of time, and prevents the bar being rolled so many times before it cools; accordingly for thin plates or rods of small section the three-high train is always used (or some more complex analogous combination of rollers). As a rule the speed of rotation of the rolls is less the heavier the plate, &c., rolled; for very thick armour plates (of which sizes up to 20 and 30 tons are sometimes rolled) a comparatively small number of revolutions per minute suffices; for thin rod a much larger number up to several hundreds; from 80 to 100 revolutions is about the usual speed for rolling rails and similar heavy bars, 50 or 60 being employed for very thick ones, 120 to 150 for lighter bars, and considerably more rapid speeds for very thin bars, rods, and wire. Space will not permit of descriptions of the details of various kinds of rolling-mill plant, &c., introduced in different works, and more especially of numerous American improvements in this direction, particularly those of Messrs Fritz; for descriptions of these, the technological journals, &c., of the last few years must be consulted.

For rolling tires a peculiar arrangement of comparatively small rolls is employed; the ingot after having a hole punched through it (or cast in a thick ring if of molten “ingot metal ”) is subjected to a kind of rolling action between two surfaces, one inside the ring and the other outside, so that the circumference of the ring is gradually extended and its thickness diminished, whilst the flange is simultaneously formed.

When thin rods of rectangular section are required (c.g., nail rod), they are often made by rolling out a bar into a long wide thin plate, which is then passed through a “slitting mill” consisting of a pair of steel rollers with deep grooves, the projecting portions of the one fitting into the grooves of the other, but not reaching to the bottom of the grooves. These projecting portions act as revolving shears, so that the plate is “slit” as it passes into thin rods, the width of which is regulated by the width of the grooves; after passing through the machine these are straightened by hand.

In order to cut puddle bars into lengths for piling, powerful shears are employed. Fig. 49 represents one form of double shears worked by a reciprocating lever actuated by an eccentric; fig. 50 represents a much more powerful form of guillotine shears. A massive plate B with a terminal shearing edge AA works slowly up and down in guides by means of eccentrics C, C, C on the shaft D; this cutting edge passes just in front of a similar one permanently fixed to the guide posts. The plate to be sheared is supported on a table aa in front of the shears, running backward and forward upon a little railway; whilst the upper cutting edge is elevated, the plate is quickly run into position, and as the cutting edge descends is sheared across, the cut-off portion dropping down; as the cutter ascends again the plate is turned round or pushed forward, so as to bring under the cutter the portion to be sheared at the next down stroke. The same kind of machine serves for cutting boiler plate .to any required dimensions, and for shearing purposes generally. Substituting a solid steel plunger for the cutting edge, the machine becomes a punching machine, the plate to be punched being supported on a travelling table, and the spot where the rivet-hole, &c., are to be pierced being brought under the end of the punch whilst the latter is raised. A powerful fly-wheel is requisite whenever the plate to be sheared or punched is massive. For cutting ‘ ‘ crop ends ’ ’ off hot or cold railway bars after rolling so as to reduce them to a uniform length, an arrangement analogous to a travelling table is used, urged forward by an eccentric, a toothed wheel and screw, or a chain and axle,~&c , fig. 51; on this the bar FF is placed against stops B, B, and the table then moved forward (as represented in the figure by means of the handle G actuating an eccentric on the axis AA) so as to bring the bar gradually against the pair of rapidly revolving circular (usually toothless) saws C, C worked by a band and pulley E, and thrown out of gear by shifting the band to the “idle pulley” D when required; to prevent the saws from becoming overheated, the lower portions dip into water troughs as they revolve. A single circular saw revolving 5000 times a minute (with a circumferential velocity of about 300 miles per hour) has been used for this purpose. For obliterating file marks, reducing to roughly plane surfaces, cutting slots, smoothing, and many other purposes for which grindstones, &c., were formerly employed, emery wheels made of pulverized emery cemented together with calcium silicate are often used with great advantage.

Cold Rolling.— In the ordinary processes of rolling iron plates and rods, &c., the metal is at a high temperature so as to be softened by the heat; when cold iron is similarly rolled the compression thereby produced gives a much greater stiffness and elasticity: thus Fairbairn found that an increase in strength in bars from 60,746 lb per square inch before rolling to 88,230 after was thus effected. Whipple (of the U. S. navy) finds that in sheet iron the tenacity is thus increased by 60 and even 100 per cent, of the original value, and Thurston has recently found analogous results both as to increase in tenacity and power to resist strains and in the modulus of elasticity. The process is largely in use in America, being carried out by rolling the bars, <fcc., out to a little larger dimensions than the finished metal is intended to have; they are then “pickled” in dilute hydrochloric acid to dissolve off the film of oxide from the surface, passed through limewater to neutralize the adherent acid, and finally rolled many times in succession between grooves of great smoothness, so cut as only to compress portions and not the whole of the circumference at each passage through the rolls. For a description of the appliances used in cold rolling as carried out at the works of Jones & Laughling, U. S., who make a speciality of this business, see Engineering, vol. xxvi. p. 347 (1878).

For straightening and planishing circular steel bars such as shafting rods, &c., a peculiar machine is sometimes used, consisting of a pair of revolving disks with bevelled faces, which compress the rod slightly between them, at the same time rotating it and traversing it forwards (and, by reversal, backwards) by one continuous movement, so that all parts of the surface are equally operated on, and the bar leaves the machine circular, straight and bright-surfaced.
[9:13:331]

Numerous other machines^[29. During several years past a series of papers on ‘ ‘ American Iron and Steel Works,” by A. L. Holley and Lenox Smith, have appeared in Engineering, from which much detailed information may be gained as to modern American improvements in various directions. ] are in use for various special purposes, such as wire-drawing, drilling, screw-tapping, &c.; the description of these would take up more space than can be given here.

A marked feature in most American iron-works is the general handy, compact, and efficient nature of the machinery of all kinds, and the use of various physical-exertion-saving contrivances and arrangements for ventilation and cooling of workshops, &c., many of which appliances are not so frequently to be met with on the eastern side of the Atlantic, more especially in England. The general arrangement and planning out of works, moreover, is usually far superior to that of the older British works, which have gradually grown to their present dimensions, and consequently have not been systematically laid out as a whole. In consequence of attention to such details as these, the output of finished material from a given amount of plant is frequently considerably greater in America than would be attained in other countries, whilst the labour required is not proportionately increased; thus the largest makes of Bessemer metal from a given converter ever registered have been attained in American works; and so in other instances. To a considerable extent the same remarks apply to Continental establishments, at any rate to many of those of more modern arrangement; of late years, however, the spirit of competition and other influences have rendered it imperative upon the British ironmaster to pay more regard to such matters than was formerly the case, and to adopt many American and Continental improvements in details,—experience having opened his eyes to the fact that it is possible for other nations, though less naturally favoured as to ores and fuel, to compete successfully with him, and undersell him, not only as to foreign trade, but even in the case of English contracts for iron work for home use.

The reheating furnaces employed to heat up to a welding temperature the piles intended to be rolled are essentially low reverberatories, much resembling puddling furnaces, in which the atmosphere is kept as little oxidizing as possible; notwithstanding, a certain amount of slag is formed from the fusion of the oxide of iron coating the bars and its union with silica from the furnace bed when of sand, as is often the case; ferric oxide ores (“dry bottoms ”) are preferable, yielding less cinder and causing less waste in consequence, whence the name. To avoid introduction of air, the doors for introducing and withdrawing the piles are banked up with small coal, <fcc. Gas forms a most suitable fuel, and various forms of gas-fired reheating furnaces have been introduced: thus in Sweden Eckman’s gas reheating furnace has been in use many years, consisting of a chamber in which charcoal is partially burnt by an air blast so as to form impure carbon oxide, which passes by a tube into the reheating furnace and is there burnt. Siemens regenerators applied to reheating furpaces have also been frequently employed, and with good results, either with his gas producers or with other forms of gas generator; at Munkfors the Lundin gas producer (using damp sawdust, § 10) is employed. Another form of reheating gas furnace is the Ponsard furnace (see § 40). The chief advantage of gaseous fuel for reheating furnaces is that the atmosphere can be much more exactly regulated so as to be non-oxidizing, thus avoiding waste by “cutting” lf.e., oxidizing) the piles; independently of which, moreover, a saving in cost of fuel consumed is effected; thus Holley states that, in reheating Bessemer ingots or ordinary blooms in Siemens furnaces, 350 to 400 lb of coal are used to the ton, whilst the ordinary fires would consume 800 to 1000 lb. On the other hand, if the waste heat from the reheating furnace is used to generate steam, the saving in fuel that would otherwise have to be burnt for the purpose just about equals the difference in fuel consumption between the Siemens and the ordinary reheating furnaces.

’ Frieds retort reheating anol puddling furnace (fig. 52) is a sort of combination of a gas producer and an ordinary puddling furnace; the firegrate is supplied with fuel which has been heated in a low tower surmounting the grate by the waste gases circulating in a flue round the tower; in this way the coal is coked, the gases passing to the fireplace; a blast is introduced under the fire bars so as to burn the coke and produce a large body of flame of reducing character owing to the admixture of hydrocarbons from the coking process in the tower; the blast is heated by passing through a chamber surrounded by the waste-gas flue; by regulating it the atmosphere can be made more or less reducing at pleasure. The saving of fuel effected is said to amount to about one-third of that which would be required in an ordinary puddling furnace, whilst when arranged as a reheating furnace a still greater saving is produced.

Utilization of Waste Heat.— In all iron works the amount of heat escaping from the puddling and reheating furnaces (except when regenerative) is enormously in excess of the amount actually utilized; to economize this waste heat to some extent, it is usual to employ the exit gases for raising steam, or for heating the air blast, or both. The actual amount of fuel employed in the operations of puddling and reheating (apart from that corresponding to the motive power) varies within wide limits according to the quality of the pig iron used in the first instance and the mode of operating adopted. When the coke refinery is employed a consumption of coke to the extent of 15 to 30 per cent, of the weight of the pig iron used usually suffices to produce a refined metal, which is then convertible into puddle bar with an expenditure of coal about equal to or somewhat exceeding that of the puddle bar made; where particular manipulation requiring the working of only small batches at a time is practised, e.g., in some of the West Yorkshire iron-works, the consumption of fuel is often much larger, amounting in some cases to nearly double the weight of pig iron treated originally. In the ordinary pig boiling process, according to the purity of the metal, something between 100 and 150 parts of coal per 100 of puddle bar, and sometimes even more, are usually requisite, but considerably smaller amounts are said to be used with some of the more recently invented kinds of furnaces. Analogous [9:13:332] results are obtained when lignite, wood, peat, or other fuel is employed, due allowance being made for its different calorific power. For reheating furnaces in which coal is burnt, the consumption of fuel is usually in excess of 50 per cent, of the metal ultimately rolled for each time it is reheated. The yield of puddle bars from a given quantity· of pig varies somewhat with the quality: in spite of some of the iron oxide of the fettling being reduced, the weight of malleable iron (cinder being deducted) finally obtained in hand furnaces is always somewhat less than that contained in the pig iron used; the latter averaging say 94 or 95 per cent, of iron, the yield of puddle bar may be said to run from 88 to 92, averaging about 90 per cent. Before an ordinary class of iron ore is converted into gocd bar iron there is in practice requisite a consumption of coal (or of its equivalent in coke, taking say 3 parts of coke to represent 5 of coal) to about the following extent per 100 parts of malleable iron finally obtained, that is, when each operation is conducted about as economically as is practicable on the large scale :—
[table]

In reference to this last item the consumption of puddle bar varies much with circumstances; a considerable fraction of the final iron is obtained in the form of mill scale, which is not lost, being utilized in the puddling forge, or for smelting, &c.; the rest is obtained in the form of cuttings, “crop ends,” and “scrap” of various kinds, often not very largely inferior in value to the bar iron.

26. Puddled Steel and Natural Steel.— If in the operation of converting pig iron into malleable iron by puddling in a reverberatory furnace the process be stopped before the decarbonization is complete (the temperature of the furnace being a little lower, so that the partial solidification of the mass on decarbonization—“coming to nature”— takes place more easily), the resulting metal is a more or less carbonized iron, which, when prepared from pig free from any large quantity of sulphur and phosphorus, is susceptible of many of the applications to which steel is put. Considerable skill in manipulation is necessary in order to obtain anything at all approaching to a uniform product, the tendency being towards the production of a mass with lumps of soft wholly decarbonized iron, and sometimes of but little decarbonized pig irregularly distributed through it. This is best overcome by conducting the decarbonization more slowly and at a somewhat lower temperature than is usually done in ordinary puddling, and using less fettling and a less oxidizing atmosphere. A manganiferous pig is almost essential to the obtaining of a good product, first because the oxidation of the manganese gives a more fluid slag, and secondly because the small quantity retained by the product decreases the injurious effects of sulphur, phosphorus, &c., on the physical properties of the metal.

The manufacture of puddled steel in England is now but small, the Bessemer and Siemens-Martin processes having largely superseded it. Occasionally, however, substances apparently consisting of badly puddled iron, and possessing some degree of hardening power, are sold under the name of steel; but, not having been fused so as to give uniformity of composition, these products are incapable of being ιιsed advantageously for purposes for which the elasticity and capability of resisting wear and tear possessed by good steels are essential. The want of a definite understanding as to whether the term ‘ ‘ steel” is nowadays to be understood as implying that the product has been completely fused (as maintained by some, see § 3) or not leads occasionally to disputes and lawsuits, when inferior kinds of “puddled steel,” or badly decarbonized puddled iron, are supplied under the terms of a contract which simply mentions “steel” as the character of the metal to be supplied, without precisely stating its nature, quality, or properties, or the mode of its production.

On the Continent, puddled steels made from pig of pure qualities so far as sulphur and phosphorus are concerned are more extensively employed. Schilling has examined the relative rates at which carbon, silicon, phosphorus, and sulphur are eliminated from the pig irons of Gittelde and Zorge in a charcoal steel-puddling forge at Zorge (Hanover), obtaining the results given in the following table:—
[table]

Similar results have been obtained by other observers; thus Parry gives the following analyses of British puddled steel (Ebbw Vale) and of the original pig employed:—
[table]

Natural steel is to refined pig iron (§ 23) in the inverse relation that puddled iron is to puddled steel: the last is derived from pig iron by stopping the decarbonization at a stage before it is complete; the first is obtained by carrying the refining process somewhat further than the stage usually attained in the refinery. The forge or hearth used for natural steel making is substantially like that employed for refining, a brasqued bottom of charcoal dust being put on, and the pig iron melted down and gradually decarbonized by the conjoined action of an inclined blast blowing downwards upon it and of the cinder floating above it; if the decarbonization is carried too far a little fresh pig is added to recarbonize the whole. The details of the manipulation (upon the mode of performance of which the character of the resulting product depends) vary in different localities; thus Tiinner describes five distinct modifications practised in Siegen, Tyrol, Carinthia, and Styria; save in these districts the manufacture of this class of steel is but small. The bars ultimately formed from the blooms are usually hammered out by hand entirely, and not machine rolled at all. For further details see Percy’s Metallurgy.

27. Bessemer ’ s {Original} Process.— The method usually known in this country as “Bessemer’s process” of steel making does not, strictly speaking, belong to the class of methods now under discussion, being a combination-process consisting of two parts :—one the Bessemer process proper, of which the essential feature is the conversion of cast iron into wrought iron by the method (due to Bessemer) of forcing air through the molten mass so as to burn out the carbon; the other (due to Mushet) consisting of the conversion of the molten wrought iron thus obtained into steel by mixing with it a suitable proportion of fused carbonized iron containing manganese, in the form of spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese; this combination process is discussed more fully in § 36.
[9:13:333]

The decarbonizing and desiliconizing of iron by the action of an oxidizing atmosphere is the essential feature of the processes of refining pig iron (§ 23) and of making natural steel (§ 26); but prior to 1855 these processes had only been applied to the partial purification and decarbonization of pig iron, the air being blown over the surface of the fused metal; and, in consequence of the comparatively slow rate of oxidation of carbon and silicon thus brought about, the use of fuel to melt the iron and to keep it in fusion was essential.

On September 15, 1855, an English patent was granted to Gilbert Martien of Newark, New Jersey, U.S., for the purpose of partially purifying cast iron by passing streams of air or steam “through and amongst the melted metal as it flows from a blast furnace” or the remelting furnace, the object being apparently, not to convert pig iron into wrought iron and to supersede the puddling furnace, but simply to act as an adjunct to the refinery. Shortly after, Parry made experiments at Ebbw Vale on a process substantially the same as this. On October 17, 1855, Bessemer took out his first patent for “forcing currents of air or of steam, or of air and steam, into and among the particles of molten crude iron or of remelted pig or refined iron, until the metal so treated is thereby rendered malleable and has acquired other properties common to cast steel, and still retaining the fluid state of such metal, and pouring or running the same into suitable moulds,”—i.e., for converting cast iron into cast steel. A succession of patents for various improvements was taken out during the next few months, in the course of which the use of steam was dropped, certain particular appliances described, and the production of malleable iron as well as steel claimed. It was speedily found, however, that the production of steel of uniform quality from English pig irons was impracticable, owing to the difficulty in stopping the blowing operation at exactly the right moment to produce the desired degree of carbonization, and that the production of malleable iron was equally an unsuccessful manufacturing operation, because if the “blow” continued a little too long, the product was “burnt iron,” containing oxide disseminated through it which rendered it brittle; whilst if the metal were underblown it was hard and steely. Again, contrary to expectation in view of the knownaction of the puddling process, the oxidation of the copper, sulphur, and phosphorus contained in the pig iron was found to be so faintly marked that practically the resulting “semi-steel” contained the whole of these impurities originally present in the pig iron employed. Accordingly the value of the new process, of which the highest expectations were at first formed, was speedily found to be really but small, notwithstanding the various successive improvements patented by the inventor during 1855 and 1856; towards the end of the latter year, however, the difficulty was solved and the whole process rendered practical and readily controllable by Mushet, who patented the improvement in use to the present day of decarbonizing the iron by completely blowing it, and then adding melted spiegeleisen in known quantity so as to carbonize the total mass to any definite required extent, and also to introduce manganese into the composition, thereby diminishing the injurious effects of sulphur, phosphorus, &c., on its physical qualities,—the character of the metal being further regulated by choosing for the operation haematite pig, or some other kind, containing only minute amounts of sulphur, copper, and phosphorus. Mushet’s patent right, however, was allowed to lapse through neglect to pay the requisite fees in the third year; and in consequence his name is all but forgotten in connexion with his improvement on Bessemer’s own process, the combination being ordinarily termed “Bessemerizing.” Details as to the practical working of the combination process are given in § 36.

It is to be here remarked in connexion with the Bessemer process proper (the blowing) that, whilst the difficulties in the way of preparing uniform products with English irons have led to the entire abandonment of the production of iron or steel thereby in England, the method is still in use to some extent in Sweden, at Seraing, and elsewhere, the proper moment when the blow should cease being determined by rapidly sampling and testing the metal, or by the colour of the slag. In Sweden the charges of metal blown at one operation are occasionally much smaller than those usually employed elsewhere where the combination-process is adopted, whilst the converters in use are sometimes of the fixed pattern adopted by Bessemer in his earlier experiments, now mostly superseded for the spiegeleisen process by the movable converters swinging on trunnions described in § 36; in the newer Bessemer works, however, the most improved methods and arrangements are in use.

In the John Cockerill Works (Seraing) it has been found practicable to ensure the continuous production of pig in the blast furnaces of sensibly constant composition, Algerian and Spanish ores being employed. From these, pig of the annexed composition is smelted and ran direct into the converters without solidifying; 23 '5 parts of limestone per 100 of ore are employed together with coke (containing 8 to 10 per cent, of ash) in the proportion of 22 cwts. per ton of pig.
[table]

Owing to the considerable amount of manganese present in the pig, sufficient of that metal remains unoxidized in the blown product to render it unnecessary to add spiegeleisen thereto; on this depends the practicability of the process; the blowing is continued until a specimen of the slag (obtained during a brief intermission of the blast for the purpose) exhibits a particular colour dependent upon the amount of residual carbon required, whilst the physical characters of the globules of metal interspersed throughout the sample are also noted; the metal is then tipped into the casting ladle, and run into ingots which are reheated when solid enough to be withdrawn from the moulds and rolled without ever cooling below a red heat. The colour scale and the corresponding carbon percentages are as follows :—
[table]

As regards the general character of the blowing operation, it is noticeable that the generation of heat by the oxidation of silicon and carbon is so large that without the use of any fuel at all the metal is not only kept melted but increases considerably in temperature, so that it remains fluid whilst the decarbonization goes on, instead of becoming pasty and almost solid as it does in the puddling forge when “coming to nature.” The nature of the gaseous products on blowing a considerable mass of metal, say 5 tons, is somewhat different during the different stages of the process. At first when the metal is at a relatively lower temperature, a considerable amount of carbon dioxide is formed, together with carbon oxide, but later on, when the temperature is much higher, little but carbon oxide is produced. During the early stages, moreover, the amount of oxygen (combined as oxides of carbon) is much less relatively to the nitrogen than in ordinary air, showing that much of the silicon and manganese present are being oxidized; whilst in the latter half of the blow, when the silicon and manganese have largely become oxidized, the amount of oxygen in the issuing gases is much larger, nearly equal to that present in air. Thus the following series of analyses were made by Snelus during an eighteen minutes blow {Journal Iron anol Steel Institute, 1871, ii. p. 247), the specimens being collected respectively after two, four, six, ten, twelve, and fourteen minutes from the commencement. Similar results have also been subsequently obtained^by other chemists, notably Adolf Tamm (Jern-Kontorets Annaler, xxx. 257; also Iron, 1879), with the iron made at Westanfors from charcoal pig.
[table]

From these analyses Snelus calculates that 43 per cent, of the total carbon oxidized in this blow was converted into CO 2 , and 57 percent. into CO. It hence results that a considerable development of heat attends the operation, especially with irons moderately rich in silicon’as well as carbon. Taking the heat of combustion of caτbon to CO as 2400, of carbon to CO 2 as 8000 (§ 20), and of silicon to SiO 2 as 7800 (Troost and Hautefeuille give 7830), and assuming that these are also the values of the combustion heats of these elements when dissolved in (or united with) iron,—which is not the case, the values being really somewhat lessened by the amounts of heat evolution during the solution in (or combination with) the iron,— it results that, on blowing an iron containing for instance 2 percent. of silicon and 3 per cent, of carbon, there will be a heat development to the following extent :—
[9:13:334]
[table]

or an evolution of 300 '2 per unit weight of metal blown. Analogous but somewhat different values are calculable with irons of different composition, or with blows so conducted that less carbon dioxide is formed. The mean specific heat of the resulting fused metal and slag is probably somewhere near to 0 '20 (at the ordinary temperature the specific heat of iron is 0 , 1138, Regnault; the specific heat is probably greater as the temperature rises, and, judging by analogy with water, greater in the fluid state than in the solid; the specific heat of the slag at the ordinary temperature is higher than that of iron, but its mass is much less); hence, pursuing the above calculation, the heat evolution would suffice to raise the temperature of

300’2

the metal -θy=about 1500° C. above its initial temperature, were all the heat applied to that purpose. This is not the case, however, for the containing vessel or converter has also to be heated up, and the waste gases carry off a notable amount of heat with them, whilst radiation and the cooling effects of the air on the converter also take up a considerable fraction of the heat; on the other hand, however, a certain amount of iron becomes oxidized, thus increasing the heat development; if 5 per cent, of metal be thus oxidized, the heat of oxidation being taken as somewhere near to 1200 per unit of weight of metal oxidized, the heat evolution due to this will be τ ⅞ 7 × 1200 = 60'0, or about ⅜ of that due to the joint oxidation of the carbon and silicon. Similarly manganese, if present, becomes oxidized with evolution of heat; on the whole it is calculated by Jordan, Âkermann, Snelus, and others who have specially examined this subject, that with the kinds of pig iron usually employed at the present day, and with the size of converters used (holding 5 tons and upwards of metal), the net amount of heat actually employed in heating up the metal is sufficient to raise its temperature by at least 600°; so that if the initial temperature of the fused pig is about 1400°, that of the blown metal is at least 2000°, being above the melting point of platinum; with highly silicious pig the temperature attained is notably higher than with metal containing less silicon.

When the blowing has gone on for a short period, so that the iron has become perceptibly raised above its initial temperature, a reaction commences between the iron oxide or silicate already formed and the as yet unoxidized carbon, giving rise to the evolution of gas with a sort of effervescence; this stage is technically termed the “boil.” The precise period at which it is marked varies with circumstances, a longer time elapsing from the commencement of the blow when the iron is relatively cooler at first, and also when it is richer in silicon,—in the former case because the temperature requisite to produce the effervescent action is not reached until a longer time has elapsed, and in the second because the more oxidizable silicon is chiefly affected first, and the effervescent action of iron oxide, <tc., on the dissolved carbon only commences when the silicon is to a considerable extent oxidized.^[30. In all probability the reason why the silicon is first affected is simply because more heat is evolved in the formation of silicon dioxide than of carbon oxide, so that if carbon were burnt to carbon oxide silicon would probably react upon it, thus— 2CO + Si = 2C + SiO, Since the heat of combustion of a unit of weight of carbon to CO is about 2400, afid that of silicon to SiO7800, the transformation 9 V Ί 2 y 240∩ indicated by the above equation would evolve 7800 ———— 28 = 5743 units of heat per unit of weight of silicon,—a tolerably high value, indicating a considerably strong tendency towards the occurrence of this transformation. ] During the earlier part of the boil, whilst the silicon and manganese still present are being oxidized, a greyish or whitish kind·of smoke issues from the converter, consisting of minute particles of slag, manganese oxide, <fcc., mechanically diffused through the gases. When practically all the silicon, carbon, and manganese have been oxidized, and the oxidizing action of the blast is concentrated on the iron, the colour of the smoke emitted changes to brown, and the iron becomes “burnt” or “overblown”; if to such metal containing much iron oxide diffused throughout it molten spiegeleisen be added, as in the after part of the Bessemer-Mushet process (§ 36), the effervescence or “boil” due to the reaction of this iron oxide on the carbon of the spiegeleisen takes place with almost explosive violence.

The following analyses by Snelus (Joum. I. and S. Bist., 1871, i. 39) illustrate the gradual diminution in carbon, silicon, and manganese, and the non-removal of phosphorus during the process of blowing:—
[table]

Analogous figures have been obtained by various other observers; the results as a whole show that during the first few minutes of the blow the silicon and manganese mainly are oxidized, raising the temperature; during this period the carbon is also being oxidized, but not so rapidly as during the next interval whilst the boil is proceeding, a result also indicated by the analyses of the gases evolved (supra). The oxidation of the silicon, however, may not be complete even when the whole of the carbon has been burnt out, especially if highly silicious pig was used in the first instance; thus steels containing 0 ’ 5 and upwards of unoxidized silicon have been found to be formed; when excessively soft steel is required, so that but little spiegeleisen (or preferably ferro-manganese) is added to the blown metal, the presence of this silicon is not only not injurious, but is desirable as it diminishes “honeycombing”; but with ordinary “Bessemer steel” containing several tenths per cent, of carbon, the presence of this amount of silicon is almost fatal to its value, silicon conjointly with carbon producing brittleness to a marked extent. Accordingly it is of importance to blend a highly silicious pig with another kind containing less silicon, or to add to the highly silicious pig crop ends and scrap metal, so as to avoid the presence of too much silicon in the steel ultimately produced; this intermixture when judiciously performed also avoids certain practical difficulties attending the use of pig containing too high or too low an amount of oxidizable matter other than iron; in the former case the temperature attained during the blow is excessive, so that on casting the final steel (after adding spiegeleisen, see § 36) in iron moulds these are partly fused and destroyed; in the former case the temperature attained is not high enough to keep the metal fluid whilst pouring into the moulds, in which case it more or less solidifies in the casting ladle, forming a “skull,” whilst the slag partially solidifies in the converter and gradually chokes it. In practice it is usually found desirable to have not less than 2 and not more than 3 per cent, of silicon in the metal before blowing, so as to avoid these difficulties; when the pig is melted in a cupola there is always a liability to loss of silicon and carbon during the fusion through oxidation, thus impoverishing the iron in combustible matter and risking the formation of skulls, owing to the metal not becoming hot enough during the blowing to remain fluid whilst casting; on the other hand, when the metal is run in from the blast furnace direct (by means of an intermediate ladle) there is a liability to variation from time to time in the quality of the pig; this difficulty can be overcome by carefully regulating the working of the furnace. Durfee has proposed to tap the blast furnace into large gas-fired heaters in which the metal is kept melted for a sufficiently long time to determine its character[9:13:335], pig rich or poor in silicon and carbon as the case may be being then added to give the requisite composition.

According to Stead the rate at which silicon is oxidized in the converter relatively to carbon is somewhat different according as the temperature attained is extremely high or comparatively low. In the latter case the silicon is wholly eliminated before the carbon disappears, even when the original amount was large, say 3 per cent, silicon and 3 ’ 5 of carbon; in the former case, however, the relative rate of oxidation of the silicon is less rapid, so that the carbon becomes oxidized before the last traces of silicon have disappeared. Thus the curves illustrated in fig. 53 indicate the percentages of carbon and silicon contained in the metal in different stages of the blowing, the dotted lines representing the former and the continuous lines the latter, the abscissae representing times and the ordinates percentages. Just at first the carbon percentage slightly increases owing to oxidation of metal and silicon and their removal as slag; but by and by the rate of carbon removal becomes rapid, whilst the rate of silicon removal is a maximum at first and gradually diminishes, more rapidly at the higher temperature.

Attempts have been frequently made to use the spectroscope as a means of determining the moment when the last portions of silicon and carbon have become oxidized; but it is very doubtful whether the indications of the character of the flame as seen by the unaided eye are not as a general rule practically at least equally valuable with those of the spectroscope, and much more readily attainable. At any rate, the spectroscope is but little used in actual manufacturing practice in England; on the Continent, however, its use is somewhat more frequent.^[31. A report of a lecture on the use of the spectroscope in Bessemerizing, given by Roscoe to the Iron and Steel Institute, is to be found in the Journal I. and S. Inst., 1871, ii. p. 38. Alleyne has attempted to utilize the spectroscope for the determination of phosphorus in steel, ibid., 1875, i. p. 62. ] The more smoky the flame the less distinct are the spectroscopic indications, so that with highly manganized pig (e.g., pig from Austrian spathose ores) the instrument is all but useless. With certain kinds of pig the progress of the decarbonization can be readily judged by the colour of the slag; the peculiar roar of the blast alters slightly in character when the decarbonization is complete, so that an experienced hand can judge by the sound alone when the operation is about finished. For details of apparatus, <fcc., see § 36.

The slag formed during the blowing usually approximates in composition to the metasilicate formula R 2 O, SiO 2 , where R 2 is either iron or manganese,—in this respect differing from the tap cinder of the ordinary puddling forge, which is much more basic. This arises from the highly silicious nature of the lining of the converter (see § 36).

It has been proposed by Snelus to utilize the gases discharged from the converter, especially during the latter half or so of the blow, in the same way that blast furnace gases (which they closely resemble in general composition, § 18) are utilized; the practical difficulties are, however, considerably greater than in the case of the blast furnace, chiefly on account of the much higher temperature of the converter gases and the intermittent character of their generation during a series of blows; but stoves for heating the blast for the cupolas used in melting the spiegeleisen, &c., have been successfully heated in this way, the flame being applied in much the same way as that obtained from blast furnace gases. For the description of a method used for this purpose in Sheffield, see a paper by C. B. Holland, Journal I. and S. Inst., 1878, p. 104.

28. Heaton’s Process.— The chemistry of this process is closely allied to that of Bessemer’s, the oxidizing gases used to decarbonize the pig iron being blown through the fused mass so as to produce either a semi-steel, a harder steel, or something approaching malleable iron, according to the amount of carbon oxidation effected,—the gases employed being, not ordinary air, but the mixture of nitrogen, nitrogen oxides, and.oxygen evolved by the action of heat upon sodium nitrate. This salt is packed at the bottom of the converting vessel (usually a vertical cylinder of iron lined with firebrick) to the extent of about 10 per cent, of the weight of the pig to be treated, and covered over with a perforated cast iron plate; the pig, previously melted in a separate furnace, is run into the converter; the heat melts the sodium nitrate and causes an evolution of gas, at first comparatively slow, but gradually increasing in violence as the perforated iron plate melts, until a rapid ebullition of the whole mass takes place; after a few minutes the reaction is over; the partly decarbonized fluid mass is then run into ingot moulds (if the mass operated upon is sufficiently large to render the product fluid enough) or otherwise removed from the converter, conveniently by detaching the bottom portion, which is made removable purposely; the masses of “crude steel” are then reheated and rolled, or melted in crucibles, so as to produce either bar or crucible steel as required.

Unlike the Bessemer process, Heaton’s method brings about a sensible diminution in the quantity of phosphorus present. In all probability this is due to the alkalinity of the cinder owing to the soda from the nitrate, this acting like the lime lining to the converter in Thomas and Gilchrist’s modification of the Bessemer process (§ 37); it is evident, however, that the character of the resulting product depends on the uniformity of the pig iron used, and the amount of nitrate of soda employed. The practical difficulties in the way of carrying out the process on the large scale, and of securing uniformity of product, and the non-entire removal of phosphorus, have prevented this method from seriously competing with the other leading steel-making processes; but a number of experimental trials made on a moderately large scale have demonstrated the possibility of obtaining a good class of useful steel by its means. According to Griiner the elimination of phosphorus becomes almost imperceptible if the cinder formed contains upwards of 30 per cent, of silica produced by the oxidation of the silicon in the pig.

VI. Methods involving the Production of Steel or Malleable Iron direct from the Ore without PASSING THROUGH THE STAGE OF FUSED PlG IRON.

29. Catalan Forge.— This variety of bloornery may be taken as being a typical development of the earliest crude apparatus for extracting iron from its ores, represented in almost its simplest form by the rough clay furnace used for the first stage of wootz making (§ 35), and by the analogous small furnaces in use in Burmah, Madagascar, Borneo, &c.; with various modifications it is still in use in different localities, e.y., the Pyrenees, Corsica, and especially in some parts of America and Canada. In principle all these forges may be considered as a more or less enlarged blacksmith’s or ordinary rivetting forge, in the bed of which are [9:13:336] placed together the ore to be reduced and the fuel; the blast being applied, partly by the direct action of the ctrbon, partly by the carbon oxide generated, the iron - ore is gradually reduced to a spongy mass of metal which by stirring is gradually agglutinated into a ball which is removed and worked into bars, &c. The Pyrenean forge essentially consists of a silicious stone bottom (covered over with a “brasque”of charcoal powder rammed down), with a tuyere inclining downwards, as indicated in fig. 54; the front part of the forge is filled up with the ore to be reduced, and the hinder part with charcoal, and the whole coated over with a layer of moist mixed fine ore and charcoal dust (greillade) to moderate the combustion. A gentle blast is at first applied, and the formation of flame channels throughout the mass avoided by putting on more greillade wherever any flame of magnitude appears on the surface:

in this way the ore gets largely reduced to spongy metal by the carbon oxide; a portion is only reduced to ferrous oxide, and this unites with the silicious gangue, forming a fusible cinder which, bathing the mass of spongy metal, prevents its becoming highly carbonized; finally, the blast being increased and the whole contents of the hearth being gradually stirred together, the reduced metal becomes agglomerated into spongy masses. According to the way in which the materials are manipulated, the resulting iron is more or less steely in character: a slow and prolonged reduction facilitates the carbonization of the metal, yielding a product containing 0 ’ 5 per cent, of carbon and upwards; a more rapid blast, and one impinging more directly on the bath of melted cinder and spongy metal at the base of the hearth, produces a softer and far less carbonized iron. Even after well working under the hammer until fibrous in texture, the bars produced are apt to be non-homogeneous, steely portions being irregularly interspersed. Owing to the non-addition of flux, a great waste of metal is produced by the formation of cinder containing usually some 30 per cent, and more of iron as silicate; the exact amount of loss of course varies with the ore employed, being less the purer the ore and the more open its texture, so that reduction takes place more readily; for this reason brown haematites of not too compact texture are the ores preferably worked by the Catalan forge, the expulsion of water on first heating leaving the residual oxide in a condition in which it is more readily attacked by the reducing agents than is the case with nearly anhydrous compact red haematites, &c.

In various places where the Romans smelted or reduced iron from different kinds of ore by processes substantially the same as this, large accumulations of highly ferruginous cinders exist, e.g., in the Forest of Dean, Elba, Spain, &c.; many of these contain sufficient iron to be capable of being profitably smelted in the blast furnace either alone or admixed with other ores, being frequently quite as rich as average Cleveland clay ironstone after roasting; they usually approximate in composition to the orthosilicate type, 2R 2 O,SiO 2 ,

The Catalan forges of the south of Europe are usually of such dimensions as hold from 3 to 10 cwts. of ore; those formerly in use in Austria, and to some extent still in America (β.g., the Champlain forge), have the blast heated to a greater or lesser extent by the waste flames from the forge, which are made to heat a serpentine through which the blast is blown, thereby causing a considerable saving in the amount of charcoal required, sometimes amounting to about 20 per cent, of the quantity requisite with cold blast when the blast temperature averages about 300° (Sterry Hunt). The titaniferous iron sand smelted at Moisie in similar forges is much less easily reducible than most other ores, and consequently consumes a much larger amount of fuel in proportion; owing to the almost complete absence of sulphur and phosphorus, a very fine quality of iron can be produced therefrom. The American bloom- -ery processes, whilst resembling in general principles the old European Catalan forge methods, differ considerably therefrom in working details, mode of construction of hearth, dimensions, &c. An account of them and the ores worked by them, abridged from Sterry Hunt’s Reports to the Canadian Geological Survey, is to be found in the Journal Iron and Steel Inst., 1871, ii. 103 and 126.

30. Spongy Metal Processes.— The essential chemical reaction taking place in the Catalan forge being the reduction of oxide of iron to the metallic state by carbon and carbon oxide, it has been attempted by many inventors to effect this reduction on a larger scale and in separate apparatus, the spongy metal thus obtained being employed either to form malleable iron by heating to a welding heat and hammering, &c., or to produce steel by fusion in crucibles with carbonaceous matter or intermixture with fused cast iron (free from any considerable quantity of sulphur and phosphorus) so as to reduce the percentage of carbon to any required limits in proportion as more or less spongy non-carbonized metal is employed. This latter application comes rather into the category of processes described later on (§ 36 et seq.) than into the class at present under discussion; its employment has met with some considerable degree of success in one form or another,—which can hardly be said of the former methods of working up the spongy metal, at least from a commercial point of view.

Some of the earliest experiments in this direction were made about 1837 and 1840 by Clay,^[32. For details of these experiments, see Percy’s Metallurgy. ] whilst since then and even quite recently several attempts have been made to prepare either iron or steel by operations substantially of the same description by Gurllt, Larkin (who reduces very pure fine magnetic ore by heating with charcoal powder, separates the spongy metal by a magnet, and fuses it with spiegeleisen in crucibles), Renton (of Cincinnati and Newark), Henderson (of Glasgow), Yates, and Snelus, who utilizes the “Gherstonofer” furnace used for burning pyrites smalls in vitriol making, substituting powdered iron ore for the pyrites, and a reducing atmosphere for the hot air employed to oxidize the pyrites and burn off the sulphur. Moderately large scale experimental trials in this direction have been made by Chenot, and subsequently by Siemens and by Blair of Pittsburg. Chenot’s reducing furnace was essentially a series of vertical conical retorts heated externally, the ore (Bilbao, Sommorostro, or other ores containing but little sulphur and phosphorus) being either mixed with carbonaceous matter and the mixture heated in the retorts, or else being placed therein alone whilst a mixture of carbon oxide and nitrogen (prepared by blowing air through incandescent charcoal) was passed through them; from time to time the reduced spongy metal was drawn off at the base of the retorts into covered iron boxes, so as to prevent reoxidation as much as possible, and then heated in a charcoal hearth and made into a ball when pasty. It is mainly in this last stage that the practical difficulties of the process are encountered: if the sponge be not powerfully compressed into comparatively solid blocks, an enormous waste by oxidation during the balling is produced; in any case, as it is practically impossible to continue the reduction of the ore in the first stage sufficiently long to remove all oxygen from it (the time requisite and the cost of fuel being then excessive), a great waste of iron ensues. These difficulties have hitherto proved fatal to the commercial success of the process; but it has been shown conclusively that a very good iron may be produced by its means, provided sufficiently pure ore be used.

The same causes of failure for the most part apply to the earlier methods of Clay, and the subsequent ones of Gurllt, Renton, Yates, Snelus, and Blair, which in principle are all much the same, the nature of the apparatus employed in producing the spongy iron being the main difference in the various processes respectively. Chenot’s attempts to produce steel from the reduced spongy iron answered no better, commercially speaking, than the malleable iron manufacture from that source; the sponge was simply compressed into small blocks after being mixed with charcoal powder, or after being moistened with melted resin, tar, or fatty matters, and heated to char the organic matters, and then melted up in crucibles. The [9:13:337] difficulties in the way of regulating the degree of carbonization, the cost, and the impurity of the resulting steel (unless excessively pure ores were used) rendered the process practically a failure. Fig. 55 indicates the apparatus used by Blair for the production of spongy iron. A is the reducing chamber into which the ore is placed along with about 5 per cent, of lime, which is found to accelerate the reduction considerably, so that a charge can be worked off in about a fifth of the time that would otherwise be requisite. Through this chamber a current of carbon oxide and nitrogen is led, produced in the gas generator B; ore and fuel are supplied from time to time through the respective hoppers g, g. The escaping gases pass away through the flue deh, a valve f being applied so that part of the gas can be passed back again through the producer so as to keep the action from going on too quickly. From time to time tho reduced metal is withdrawn by the slide n from the cooling-box kk, which is surrounded by a water jacket to facilitate the cooling of the spongy iron.

Siemens has attempted to apply a modification of the spongy iron process to the manufacture of steel, the spongy metal from a mixture of ore and carbonaceous matter heated in a revolving furnace being dropped into a bath of melted pig metal; this method, however, was found to give unsatisfactory results, first because the spongy iron would not readily dissolve in the molten pig but floated on its surface, and secondly because sulphur was taken up by it from the gases during its reduction; accordingly the precipitation method described below was adopted in its place.

Dupuy has recently proposed a direct process worked as follows: the ore to be reduced is mixed with carbon, and the mixture placed in £in annular vertical cylinder of sheet iron some 3 feet high, the outer diameter of the cylinder being about 20 inches, and the inner diameter 7 or 8 inches; a number of these masses are arranged on the coke floor of a reverberatory furnace; after heating for some hours the reduced metal and the sheet iron coatings cako together so that the masses can be removed and hammered and squeezed to muck bar, cut up, piled, and reheated and rolled into plates, bars, &c.; or they may be fused down on the open hearth into steel. It is claimed that by this treatment the metal takes up not more than one-fourth of the phosphorus contained in the ore instead of practically the whole as when smelted in the blast furnace; thus the ore of the Republic Mine of the Lake Superior district and the metal made from it by Dupuy’s process gave the following numbers (Dupuy, Journal Franklin Institute, Deeember 1877; see Iron, vol. X. p. 803) :—
[table]

The inventor considers that the phosphorus compounds do not become largely reduced in the process owing to the incomplete fusion of the metal during the reduction, the phosphates remaining blended with the cinder; as he states that the process works much better when alkalies, in quantity and kind determined by analysis of the ore, are added to the mixture before reduction, presumably the non-reduction of phosphorus is due to the “basic” nature of the cinder.

31. Siemens Precipitation Process.— About the most successful of the methods for producing iron or steel direct from the ore at one operation is that designated by Siemens the “precipitation process” (fjhem. Soc. Journal, 1873, p. 661); although it is doubtful whether this can yet be said to have completely emerged from the conditions of experimental trial as to the best conditions for competing with other methods in regard of cheapness of production, yet its practical success is demonstrated by its having been worked commercially not only in England but also in America. The principle of the process is essentially the fusion by means of an intensely heated “regenerative” furnace of the ore to be reduced with a suitable flux (lime, aluminous ore, <fcc.), and the reaction upon the fused substance of heated anthracite or hard coke forming the covering of a lower bed in the furnace (fig. 56), onto which the fused ore is allowed to flow from the upper bed. Under these circumstances the solid carbon precipitates iron from the fluid in the same way that iron precipitates copper from copper sulphate solution (saving that in the latter case no gases are evolved as complementary products); the iron agglutinates together into a pasty ball immersed in a fluid bath of cinder; when the operation is sufficiently advanced the ball is removed and shingled into blooms or made into steel by dropping it into a mass of fused pig iron, in which it rapidly dissolves. The cjnder thus produced contains much iron,—usually at least 15 per cent., and sometimes upwards of 40 per cent In an improved form of process, the double bed is dispensed with and a rotary furnace substituted(figs. 57,58), much resembling Siemens’s puddling furnace, save that the combustion chamber is rotative; the ore and flux are introduced and melted; small coal of the size of nuts is then shovelled in, when a rapid evolution of carbon oxide results, so that it is unnecessary to introduce more than a little gas from the gas regenerative heater, but mainly only heated air to burn the evolved carbon oxide; when the reduction is nearly complete, the fluid cinder is drawn off and the spongy metal balled by quick rotation for a short time. In this way, according to Siemens, a ton of iron may be reduced with [9:13:338] a consumption of not more than 25 cwts. of coal, and a ton of cast steel made with about 40 cwts. of coal; whilst even though the ore and fuel may contain considerable amounts of sulphur and phosphorus, the “precipitated” iron is almost chemically pure. The temperature requisite in this process being excessive, the bricks of which the furnace is con structed must be of the most infusible material possible; a particular kind of silica brick consisting of crushed quartz and about 2 per cent, of lime mixed together and moulded into bricks answers better than alumina (bauxite) bricks.

Ou comparing the actual consumption of fuel in this process with that used in the smelting of iron by the blast furnace and its purification by puddling, it is at once evident that a much less amount of heat is lost by radiation, conduction, and escape of hot gases and of only partially oxidized carbon (in the state of carbon oxide) in the regenerative direct process than in the blast and puddling furnaces [9:13:339] conjointly. When coal is completely burnt by cold air to carbon dioxide and water vapour (not liquid water), the products of combustion escaping at a temperature of say 300°, the actual heat development is variable with the characterof the coal, butmay be taken as approximately near to 7600, the unit of weight being the weight of coal burnt; for the heat of combustion of ash-free average coal may be taken as near to 9000, or about 8550, allowing 5 per cent, of ash (§10), when the resulting carbon dioxide and liquid water are at about 20° C.; a less amount of heat, however, is generated if the products of combustion escape at a higher temperature, say 300° C., the difference being 0’4 × 593 + (0 - 4 × 0'48 + 3 , 0 × 0’216) (300 - 20) = 462 when the coal is considered to yield 3 ’ 0 times its weight of carbon dioxide and 0 - 4 times its weight of water on complete combustion, 593 being the latent heat of water vapour at 20°, and O - 48 and 0'216 the specific heats of water vapour and carbon dioxide respectively. The nitrogen of the air used for combustion, however, is also heated to 300°, starting originally say at 20°; making allowance for the oxygen supplied by the ore, suppose that in the Siemens process the nitrogen escaping is 6 ’ 0 times the weight of the coal used, its specific heat being 0 - 24; then the heat carried away by the nitrogen is about 6 Ό × 0 - 24 × (300 - 20) = 403. On the whole, therefore, the effective calorific value of the coal will be 8550 - (462 + 403) = 7685, or 7600 in round numbers.

In order to reduce ferric oxide to metal, the heat consumption perunit weight of iron may be taken as about 1700 (contrast § 20); the heat earned out from a Siemens furnace hearth by a ball of iron will be somewhat greater than that by an equal weight o i fused pig iron from a blast furnace on account of the higher temperature, say 350 instead of 330; the same will apply to the cinder, but this increase will be more than counterbalanced by the smaller quantity thereof, so that, assuming 600 heat units to be carried out by one part of slag by weight, and the cinder to amount to 50 per cent of the iron, the heat thus carried out per unit weight of iron will be 0 , 5×600 = 300. Altogether, therefore, 1700 + 350 + 300 = 2350 units of heat would be requisite per unit weight of iron were it possible to reduce the ores in the Siemens rotator without loss by radiation, &c., and imperfect combustion, the gases leaving the regenerators at 300°; this would correspond to about ⅞-∣⅞⅜=0'309 parts of coal, or somewhat less than 6⅛ cwts. per ton of iron. If then 25 per cent, of the total heat generated by the fuel be utilized, 75 per cent being wasted through incomplete combustion, gases leaving at a higher temperature than 300°, and radiation, &c., still reduction would be accomplished by an expenditure of only 25 cwts. of coal per ton of iron. By a somewhat different mode of calculation Siemens arrives at much the same result {Chem. Soc. Journal, 1873, p. 677), viz., that about 6 - 4 cwts. of carbonaceous matter should theoretically suffice to reduce a ton of iron in the precipitation furnace; and hence that about 25 per cent of the heat actually capable of being generated is actually utilized. This high “duty” (as compared with other operations of the iron industry, especially with the blast and puddling furnaces conjointly) arises from the circumstance that whilst the reaction is proceeding carbon oxide is copiously evolved from the materials, and this is burnt in the furnace itself by admitting air and very little other gas so as to keep up the temperature almost without extraneous fuel; the carbon dioxide produced by the combustion, being above and not in contact with the reacting substances, does not in any way interfere with their action, in which respect the process of reduction in the precipitation furnace markedly differs from that in the blast furnace.

The following table, prepared by L. Gordon for Siemens (Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1873, p. 57), is of interest as representing the relative consumption of fuel during the production of one part by weight of iron by various of the processes largely used at different epochs up to the present date.

1561, p. 341). Early in the 18th century Réaumur investigated the character of the process, and found that under similar conditions a bar of iron of 0 , 2 inch in thickness was carbonized in six hours to the same extent as another bar of the same metal of 0 ’ 45 inch in thickness in about thirty-six hours. The crude “blister steel” produced by the cementation process (so termed from its blistered surface) is often simply cut into pieces, piled, heated to a welding heat, and forged, when it is converted into “shear steel or this process is repeated, when it becomes “double shear steel but when a perfectly homogeneous product is required it is melted in crucibles, when it becomes “cast steel this process was introduced by Huntsmann about 1740. The nature of the chemical changes taking place during cementation have been often regarded as somewhat uncertain; but there seems to be little room for doubt that the action in the ordinary cementation process is mainly due to the occlusion of carbon oxide (formed by the action of the air in the pores of the charcoal) in the iron, and its decomposition by the metal into carbon and an iron oxide, which is subsequently again reduced by a second portion of carbon oxide, thus—

Fe a , + y C 0 = C + F e z O i , F c x Oy + y CO = Fe z + yCO2t the two changes going on simultaneously. The escaping carbon dioxide, which penetrates through the metal less readily than does carbon oxide, and hence is apt to accumulate in certain parts, is probably the cause of the blistering of the surface of the steel often observed, especially with puddled bars containing small quantities of ferrous silicate disseminated through them; Percy has shown that fused homogeneous metal free from interspersed slag does not give rise to blisters on cementation. Certain hydrocarbons, e.g., paraffin vapour and coal gas, will carbonize iron heated therein, and the manufacture of steel by cementation in the latter has been patented by Macintosh (vide infra). Probably in these cases the carbon comes from the direct splitting up of the hydrocarbon, with elimination of hydrogen; but possibly the acieration is due to carbon oxide present in the coal gas or formed from the paraffin vapour,&c., by the action of iron oxide disseminated through the bars or adherent to their surface. Many cyanogen compounds, especially ferrocyanide of potassium, when applied to iron in a heated state convert it exteriorly into steel (case hardening), and it has in consequence been supposed that nitrogenous substances are essential to the carbonization of iron by cementation, and that nitrogen is an essential constituent of steel. The evidence in behalf of this is, however, at present unsatisfactory·; on the other hand, charcoal rich in alkalies, or a mixture of charcoal powder with a little lime and soda, will carbonize iron submitted to cementation therein more rapidly than charcoal more free from alkalies; and, as these conditions are those favourable to the formation of alkaline cyanide from the nitrogen of the air, there is some reason for supposing that the carbon in the steel formed under such circumstances (like that produced in case hardening by means of ferrocyanide) is more or less derived either from cyanogen separated from the cyanide and occluded by the iron and gradually decomposed with formation of carbon, or from some other reaction of iron upon the cyanide. Accordingly nitrogenous organic matter, such as animal charcoal, leather, horn, &c., is often mixed with the charcoal used for cementation with a view to facilitating the conversion into steel by the formation of gaseous carbon compounds with the simultaneous presence of nitrogenous vapours.

• The theory that carbon oxide is the source of the carbon com· municated to wrought iron during cementation, appears to have been first propounded by Leplay in 1846 (Ann. deChim. et Phys, [3]xviL 221), at a time when the properties of metals and other bodies in absorbing gases (i. e., the phenomena of occlusion) had not been so well studied as they have been subsequently. Leplay appears to have considered that the carbon oxide splits up directly into carbon and carbon dioxide, the latter becoming again transformed into carbon oxide by the surrounding charcoal, and to have left out of consideration the intervention of the iron in becoming alternately oxidized and reduced. Other chemists have considered that by direct contact with carbon combination of the iron therewith takes place, the carbon thus taken up by the outer layer quitting that and combining with the next layer, and so gradually travelling inwards, the outer layer recombining with more carbon as fast as it parts with carbon to the under layer, and so on throughout; the carbon thus traversing the iron by a process somewhat akin to that by which a drop of mercury in contact with a piece of gold (or certain other metals) gradually passes into and permeates the mass,—this being in short a kind of capillary action exerted upon a solid substance. Percy’s observation (Metallurgy, “Iron and Steel,” p. 109) that charcoal after being intensely ignited will not carbonize iron when air is excluded by means of hydrogen (although it will do so to some extent if still containing matters capable of being driven off by heat) negatives the possibility of the carbon being taken up by direct contact by this hypothetical kind of chemical union between solids, or solvent action of one solid on another; it may be that carbon deposited on the outer layer by the chemical action of the iron on carbon oxide, cyanogen compounds, carburetted hydrogen, &c., permeates inwards by this supposed diffusive process; but the known phenomena of the absorption of gases by colloid bodies, diffusion, dialysis, occlusion, &c., as elucidated by Graham and his followers, render it wholly unnecessary to suppose that any such action takes place, and do away with all experimental grounds for supposing that it can take place. In order to carry out the process of cementation, the bars of iron are placed in a firebrick box or chest several feet long, layers of charcoal and iron being alternately piled in until the box is filled, when a luting of fireclay or of the sandy ferruginous mud produced in grinding and polishing steel articles after manufacture, termed “wheel swarf,” is applied so as to close up the upper part of the box and prevent access of air; two or more such chests are then arranged under the arched roof of a chamber erected over a fireplace in such a way that the flames from the fire pass under and lap round the sides of the chests, and impinge upon the roof, the gases escaping through orifices in the roof into a conical chimney built over the whole,—the chamber constituting in fact a kind of furnace somewhat like a glass house or pottery kiln, the flame passing upwards from the bed instead of laterally from a fireplace at the side as in the ordinary reverberatory furnaces. Trial bars are arranged in the mass of charcoal in such positions that they can be withdrawn from time to time, and the progress of the operation examined by fracturing the bars after cooling, and seeing when the core of malleable iron disappears; from seven to ten days’ heating according to the amount of carbonization required (averaging about 1 per cent.) is generally allowed, with a total charge of some 10 to 20 tons of iron in the furnace. When the requisite carbonization is attained the fire is raked out and the chests allowed to cool; the blister steel is then either melted down into cast steel, or converted into shear steel by piling and forging, &c.

According to Boussingault a material diminution in the amount of sulphur present takes place during cementation; thus he found malleable iron specimens containing 0 - 012 to 0Ό15 per cent, of sulphur yielded steels containing only 0Ό05 to 0 ’ 006 per cent, of sulphur. Indications in the same direction but not to so great an extent have also been observed by others; no noticeable effect, however, is produced on the silicon, phosphorus, or manganese originally present, as far as the irregular way in which traces of cinder are always interspersed throughout bars of wrought iron will permit conclusions to be drawn. The following analyses indicate the effect of cementation on Swedish bar irons :—
[table]

In consequence of the phosphorus originally present remaining unchanged, only the purest brands of iron as free as possible from these ingredients are converted into cementation steel, often known as “tool steel,” commanding a high price in consequence of its physical properties, the most valuable of which are enormously deteriorated by minute quantities of sulphur and phosphorus. The process of cementation in an atmosphere of coal gas as patented by Macintosh of Glasgow consists of exposure of the bars of iron hanging vertically in a cylindrical chamber, the walls of which are kept [9:13:341] at a high temperature by an annular fireplace surrounding it, a gentle stream of well-desulphurized coal gas being allowed to pass through the chamber. The expense of the process seems to have been the chief bar to its adoption, as steel of excellent quality can readily be made by it from good malleable iron.

33. Cast Steel.— The crucibles or “pots” used for steel melting are usually made of refractory fireclay, often with an admixture of graphite, which not only communicates a greater degree of infusibility, but also diminishes the decarbonization which partial access of air unavoidably brings about during melting; they are of such size as to hold from 40 to 60 δ> of steel, and occasionally more, even up to nearly a cwt., especially in certain American steel works. As a rule a pot that has served for three successive meltings in a coke-fired furnace is so much damaged as to be unsafe for a fourth; and with inferior kinds of clay two meltings or even one only are allowed; with superior pots and gas-fired furnaces four, five, and even six heats are attainable with ease and safety. After annealing, the crucibles are heated red hot and then placed in the melting furnace on fireclay stands, round which and the pots coke is piled, two pots being usually fixed in the same “melting hole,” but sometimes more. When the pots are white hot the steel in small lumps is introduced by lifting up the cover and pouring the pieces down a long iron funnel; the covers being replaced and the fire made up, after some two or three hours the steel is fluid; but if cast immediately it is found that a much larger quantity of gas separates during solidification, rendering the steel porous, than is evolved if the metal is dead-melted, i,e., allowed to remain melted for an extra half hour or more, presumably from the reaction of the iron oxide interspersed throughout the steel upon the carbon evolving carbon oxide during the earlier period, this evolution subsequently ceasing, owing partly to the reduction of the oxide and partly to its floating up to the top of the fused mass as scoriae. According to Bessemer the chief part of the “dead melting” effect of the extra time allowed in fusing steel for the molten metal to stand in the furnace after fusion is brought about is due to the reduction of a little silicon from the crucible materials, <fcc., the presence of that element greatly diminishing the tendency to evolution of gas during solidification (see § 44). When the pots are withdrawn and the casting made (frequently from the contents of many pots combined together), they are replaced in the melting holes before they cool, and used over again, a somewhat smaller quantity of metal being introduced for the second melting (and less still for the third), in order to prevent the surface of the fused scoria being at the same level as before, the pots being chiefly attacked at that place. About 3 ’ 5 parts of coke are required for 1 of mild steel melted, and somewhat less for harder steels, which melt more easily.

The Siemens regenerative furnace (§ 10), fed with gas from a producer, can be very advantageously employed instead of the older coal or coke-fired furnaces. In such a steel melting furnace (fig. 59) the fusion chamber generally contains some two dozen pots, and is constructed in the form of a trench with overhanging sides, which are arched both horizontally and vertically to keep them from sinking in whilst in use. The floor is covered with finely ground hard coke, which burns away but slowly and does not flux or indurate, thus giving a firm foundation for the pots, which are set in a double row along the centre of the chamber; the upper roof of the chamber consists of firebrick tiles or frames filled with firebrick capable of being slid off separately by means of levers or handles attached to each, so as to permit of the introduction and withdrawal of the pots. The inventors state that the lining of a furnace of this description will last from fifteen to twenty weeks without repair, working day and night, whilst four to five weeks is the ordinary life of a coke-fired fiιrnace; that the pots will stand four, five, and sometimes even ten successive meltings instead of two or three; and that, whilst 3 to 4 tons of hard coke are requisite in coke-fired furnaces per ton of steel melted, 15 to 20 cwts. of much inferior slack burnt in a gas producer will furnish enough fuel to melt a ton of steel on the regenerative principle (Chcm. Soc. Journal, 1868, p. 276). The precise amount of fuel used in actual practice is somewhat variable, but consumptions as low as 0 - 64 parts of coal per unit of steel melted (nearly 20 tons being melted in all during one week) have been recorded. In other works the consumptions were 1T to [9:13:342] 1 ’ 45 parts of coal per 1 part of steel melted (the heat requisite for drying the pots being included). A good deal of the saving in fuel is dependent on the character of the pots employed, the best pots, which will stand several successive meltings, causing considerable economy, in that the fuel requisite to heat up new pots (starting comparatively cold) is saved, the fusion being effected in much less time, averaging from two-thirds to three-fourths of that requisite for new pots. Various modifications of the Siemens regenerative steel melting furnace have been introduced by other inventors; thus the Swindell furnace has been used to a considerable extent in America.

34. Case Hardening.— Thia operation is essentially the reverse of that by which cast iron is converted into malleable iron (§ 22). In the latter the carbon is gradually removed, the outer portion being first affected; in the former carbon is added to the exterior layer of a malleable iron article so as to give it great hardness, strength, and power of resisting wear and tear by superficial conversion into steel. As applied to larger articles in which the steely coating is required to be of more than just perceptible thickness (0 ’ 1 to 0 - 3 inch), the operation is essentially that of cementation, the iron articles being packed in an iron chest or box in charcoal reduced to very coarse powder (burnt or charred leather, hoofs, bones, <fcc., answering best), and then heated to a red heat for a sufficient length of time (some four to six hours for a coating of steel of 0 ’ 1 inch or so in thickness) either judged by past experience or by withdrawing trial pieces from time to time, and breaking them so as to ascertain to what depth the acieration has proceeded. When this is effected the chest is withdrawn from the oven or furnace and the articles chilled by taking them out whilst still hot and quenching in water or oil, &C., so as to harden the exterior coating. Since the steel exterior is thus rendered too hard for working with ordinary tools, the articles to be treated must be as far as possible finished before case hardening, so as only to require cleaning and polishing subsequently.

Sometimes a portion only of an iron object is required to be case hardened. In this case a coating of loam or clay, &c., is applied to that part of the object not required to be hardened, and gradually dried on so as to form a jacket; this prevents the ready access of carbon and carbon oxide to the covered-up part, and hence hinders or entirely prevents acieration thereat; instead of a clay coating moulded on, a roughly made loose iron jacket may be made from iron tube or sheet iron, &c., and the space between the two surfaces filled in with clay well rammed in. In certain cases the article is case hardened as a whole, those portions required to be of malleable iron being made too large; after acieration the whole is annealed, and the softened steely coating filed or lathed off from these portions, and the whole then heated and hardened.

When only a thin coating of steel is required, it is unnecessary to acierate by packing in charcoal; the iron to be hardened is heated to redness and then sprinkled with powdered ferrocyanide of potassium either by itself or mixed with other saline substances; the salt fuses and carbonizes the surface of the metal to such an extent that after hardening the exterior film is usually hard enough to resist a file. Sometimes goods are cast in the first instance (for cheapness of manufacture) and then heated in haematite, &c., so as to convert them into malleable iron to a greater or lesser extent, the outer film being finally case hardened by ferrocyanide; so that occasionally cast iron as an inner core, malleable iron as an exterior coating, and steel as an outermost film are met with in the same article. For axles, shafts, and other portions of machinery apt to encounter sudden strains which would snap a solid hard steel mass, but where certain portions (bearings, &c. ) are required to be as hard as possible to diminish wear and friction, the local case hardening of the parts required to be hard is frequently practised; and in this way certain of the advantages of both hard steel and wrought iron are combined.

For case hardening rails Dodd’s process has given good results; as practised some years ago by the North-Eastern Railway Company, charcoal, soda ash, and limestone crushed small were mixed together in the proportion of 1 cwt. of the first to 1 stone of each of the others, and charged into the case hardening furnace between successive tiers of rails. The rails remained in the furnace sixty hours; when taken out they were covered with sand till cold. The cost of the process amounts to about 12s. 6d. per ton (Lowthian Bell); but when the rails are of ordinary puddled malleable iron, a certain degree of brittleness is communicated. With rails from Danks’s machine puddled iron the carbonization was found to extend inwards for nearly a quarter of an inch, the percentages of carbon in each successive τ 1 ff inch from the surface being found to be as follows: —

35. Crucible Steel.— The term “crucible steel,” strictly applicable to the cast steel prepared by fusing cementation steel in crucibles, is often applied to denote various other somewhat different substances (also fused in crucibles), cementation cast steel being often designated “Huntsmann’s steel,” from the name of its inventor. About the beginning of the present century Mush et patented the production of a crucible steel by the direct carbonization of malleable iron by the fusion together in crucibles of bar or scrap iron and “a proper percentage of carbonaceous matter”; and also the production of a similar product direct from the ore by substituting the ore for the malleable iron and increasing the amount of reducing matter. This latter process (which is substantially the method of assaying iron ores in crucibles by the dry method on a somewhat larger scale, and with less reducing matter) had been previously patented in 1791 by Samuel Lucas, whilst substantially the same process was again patented in 1836 by Hawkins. But little steel, however, was made by this process until 1839, when Heath patented the use of what he termed “carburet of manganese” as an ingredient in making crucible steel, this substance being prepared by heating together manganese dioxide and carbonaceous matter. It being speedily found that the same result was produced whether this heating together of the manganese, dioxide, and carbonaceous matter was previously carried out, or whether these materials were separately added to the contents of the crucible and the whole melted together, the validity of the patent was vigorously contested, the utility of the manganese thus introduced into the resulting mass as a means of partially correcting the deleterious effects of sulphur and phosphorus being speedily apparent, and the possibility of the production of useful qualities of steel from even inferior iron being rapidly recognized as a valuable improvement. This Mushet-Heath process of fluxing together in crucibles malleable iron and steel scrap, powdered charcoal, and manganese oxide or spiegeleisen is still used to some extent; the cast steel thus produced is apt to be somewhat vesicular and porous; to overcome this when bars are required the ingots are reheated and hammered or rolled, either with or without cutting and piling; the character of the cast steel is largely variable with the proportions of malleable iron and iron already carbonized that are used. Siemens or open hearth steels have of late years largely superseded this class of products.

When blister steel is judged to be somewhat deficient in carbon, and is converted into cast steel by fusion, the amount of carbon present in the cast steel can often be increased by adding carbonaceous matter to the fragments of steel with which the crucibles are filled,—the additional carbon being taken up precisely as in Mushet’s process of date 1800. The same effect is produced to a slight extent by employing a considerable quantity of blacklead in the crucible composition, the graphite being then directly dissolved during the fusion. The Chenot process of steel making (by fusion in crucibles of spongy iron and carbonaceous matter) has been already adverted to (§ 30); Parry took out a patent in 1861 for converting puddled iron into steel by fusing it with coke and fluxes in a kind of cupola furnace so as to recarbonize the metal; by modifying the blast and proportion of fuel employed it is possible to produce either steel or cast iron containing 2 per cent, and upwards of carbon (§ 23). Apparently the cost of the fuel required for this process and other circumstances have prevented it from materially competing with the Bessemer and Siemens steel-making processes.

JVootz or Indian steel was described in 1807 by Buchanan as being prepared from the steely iron obtained by heating in a rough conical furnace of clay some 2 feet wide at the base and 1 at the top the pure magnetites and other ores of India and charcoal, the ere and fuel being supplied at the top, and the combustion urged by a rude bellows made of a goat’s skin stripped from the carcass without [9:13:343] opening up the belly, the neck being furnished with a bamboo nozzle terminating in a clay tube, forming a rough tuyere. After the fire has been urged for some hours the contents of the furnace are removed by partially breaking down the front, in the form of a rough porous ball or bloom of partially melted metal, which is then cut into pieces and charged into a crucible (made of clay mixed with a small quantity of charred rice husks) together with the wood of Cassia auriculata, chopped into little fragments; each crucible holds about a pound of metal, and is covered over with a few green leaves, preferably of Asclepius gigantea or Convolvulus laurifoHus, a clay cover being made by ramming in soft clay and drying gently. A number of these crucibles (some twenty or twenty-four) are then piled up in a clay furnace furnished with a bellows something like the original smelting furnace, the interstices being filled with charcoal. After some two lιours ’ heating the steel is fused; the crucibles are then removed and allowed to cool, and the melted cakes extracted by breaking away the clay. If the operation has been successful, the cakes are smooth-surfaced, with radiating striae; such cakes when remelted in larger quantities furnish an extremely fine quality of steel; when the conversion of the iron into highly carbonized steel is incomplete, the cakes are imperfectly melted down, and consist more or less largely of fritted lumps of metal not carbonized sufficiently to fuse; such cakes yield only an inferior steel when remelted. In order to forge the steel the natives heat the cakes in a charcoal bellows-forge for some hours to a temperature short of fusion, and then hammer them out by hand into bars; these are welded together by forging to wedge-heads, tying together with wire, sprinkling with borax, and quickly heating and hammering till united; the long preliminary heating partially decarbonizes the steel, so as to make the final product less like a steely cast iron. When properly prepared, the temper which this steel will take is magnificent; it is said that sabres of such steel with an edge sharp enough to cut gossamer like a razor can be dashed with the full strength of a man’s arm against a stone wall, or used to cut in two a bar of wrought iron, without having the cutting edge injured in the least degree if the swordsman be only sufficiently expert.

According to analyses made by Faraday, wootz contains a small quantity of aluminium; this probably existed as cinder disseminated through the mass, as subsequent analysts have entirely failed to detect aluminium in wootz free from slag; thus Henry {Phil. Hag., 1852) and Rammeisberg {Berichte Bezel. Chem. Ges., 1870, p. 461) found the following mean numbers, the sulphur being probably overestimated in Henry’s analysis :—

VIII. Methods of Steel Production essentially CONSISTING OF COMBINATIONS OF THE PRECEDING Processes, more or less pure Malleable Iron BEING PRODUCED IN ONE WAY, AND CARBONIZED Iron in another, and the two being blended to form Steel.

36. The Βessemer-Hudιet Process and its Precursors.— It has been known since the beginning of the 18th century at least that steel could be prepared by fusing together in crucibles cast and wrought iron; thus the operation was performed in 1722 by Reaumur employing the heat of an ordinary forge; whilst in the production of wootz it must have been observed centuries ago that by continued heating the badly prepared cakes (consisting partly of fused steel and partially of unfused> iron) frequently resulting from the first crucible operation could be fused into one mass of somewhat less hard steel than that produced at first in the more successful operations. The possibility of producing steel by fusing together a malleable and a carbonized iron is evidently a simple deduction from the processes whereby a steel is produced by the direct addition of carbon to malleable iron, e.g., those of Mushet and of Heath (§ 35). Accordingly a few years after the latter patented the use of “carburet” of manganese, he proposed

(1845) a method for making steel on a larger scale than crucible operations would permit, viz., by fusing in a cupola pig iron, running this into the bed of a steel-making furnace, into the upper part of which the malleable iron was introduced in bars so as to be heated up by the waste heat and gradually pushed forward so as to dissolve, as it were, in the molten pig with formation of steel. This method is described by Siemens as being one which would doubtless have led to complete success had the regenerative principle been known to Heath, so as to enable him to obtain the requisite intensity of heat and absence of cutting draught essential to the proper combination together by fusion of the wrought and carbonized iron without oxidation; it is substantially one of the forms of steel making by means of the open hearth or regenerative processes now in use, and known collectively as Siemens or Siemens-Martin processes (see § 39). Other patents, amounting substantially to. the same combination of wrought and cast iron by fusion so as to form steel, have been subsequently taken out by Price and Nicholson (1855), Gentle Brown, and Attwood (1862); a particular combination of this class patented by Mushet in 1855 (consisting of the addition to molten Bessemer blown decarbonized iron of fused spiegeleisen) has proved of the highest practical value (§ 27), notwithstanding that the non-removal of phosphorus and sulphur to any marked extent in the ordinary blowing process render it applicable to certain kinds of pig iron only; the recently invented “basic” process, however, bids fair to overcome this difficulty (see § 37).

The earliest form of converter patented by Bessemer, October 17, 1855, consisted of a rectangular furnace with firebars at the side instead of at thebottom, so that a number of crucibles could be heated therein, each furnished with a tapping hole at the bottom, and a pipe dipping to the bottom of the fused metal inside, through which air was to be blown, or a mixture of air and steam, the former causing the temperature to rise, the steam having a cooling effect.. Two months later another patent was taken out, the use of a spherical or egg-shaped vessel of iron lined with firebrick and supported by axes being the main novelty. In May 1856 a fixed vertical cylindrical vessel, with blast pipes at the base and a tapping [9:13:344] hole, was patented; not till some time later, however (after the introduction of Mushet’s improvement of adding spiegeleisen), was the present form of converter arrived at, consisting of a pear-shaped or bottle-shaped vessel with tuyeres at the base, and supported upon axes, one of which being hollow serves as the tube by means of which the blast is communicated to the tuyeres, whilst the vessel can be rotated into any desired position round the axis (fig. 60); the use of hydraulic power to work the converter into position, and to manipulate the ‘ ‘ ladle” into which the finished metal is run so as to be poured from it into moulds, soon followed. Subsequently various improvements in details of arrangement and construction of the plant have been introduced, notably by Holley in certain American works in the first instance; amongst these may more particularly be noticed the use of somewhat longer converters (fig. 61), with movable bottoms, so that, as the tuyeres wear out (which occurs much more rapidly than does the destruction of the lining), new previously constructed bottoms can be introduced without entailing large loss of time, whilst the greater length diminishes less by splashing and forcible ejection during the boil; the effect of these improvements is to increase the possible output from a given plant by at least 50 per cent. At first it was usual to melt the pig iron in a separate reverberatory furnace and then to run it into the converter; a cupola furnace (saving much fuel) was then substituted, a little lime being added to diminish its tendency to sulphuration; in this way scrap of all kinds can be utilized, being melted down with fresh pig in a cupola furnace much more readily than in a reverberatory, and being less decarbonized and desiliconized in so doing, which is somewhat important (§ 27). Where the blast furnaces are not too far from the converters, the molten pig is often run direct from the furnace into the converter without solidifying into pig and remelting, an intermediate ladle running on a railway being employed instead of a long gutter, which would cool the metal too much and be otherwise impracticable. In some few Swedish works the old immovable cylindrical converter is still employed, the metal being tapped out into a ladle from which it is run into the ingot moulds, but in most works, even in Sweden, movable converters are now in use. The spiegeleisen usually added subsequently is melted in another smaller cupola; in some few works however, e.g., in Styria, spiegel is not used, but when the charge is blown some more of the original pig is added; in others Bessemer’s original process is adhered to (§ 27); the use of this method, however, is comparatively limited, the combination process being usually adopted in preference. When ferro-manganese is used instead of spiegeleisen, it is usually not melted, but simply heated in a suitable vessel by the waste flame of the converter, and emptied into the casting ladle together with the blown metal so as to intermix the two, the ferro-manganese fusing as soon as it comes in contact with the blown metal.

Converters.— The improved form of converter in use at the present day is indicated by fig. 61. It consists of a vessel in shape resembling a claret bottle with the neck somewhat shortened and slightly bent over sideways; this is made of stout boilerplate, lined internally with “ganister,” a kind of sandstone possessed of peculiar physical properties, more especially of the power of binding together to a compact non-crumbly excessively infusible mass when ground to powder, moistened, and finally exposed to a high temperature. The base of the bottle is removable, being kept in position by bolts and nuts; this being removed, a core is fitted concentrically within the shell, and the moistened ganister rammed lightly in; sometimes the shell is also made of two parts thus treated separately and afterwards bolted together. The bottom is double, constituting an air chamber or “blast Lox,” the top portion of which is a perforated cast iron plate, into which are fitted tuyeres consisting of slightly conical elongated bricks or plugs perforated longitudinally with holes (between 0'15 and 0 ’ 3 inch diameter) and fixed in at the thicker end; these are composed of a mixture of fireclay and ganister, the space between them being filled up with ganister, so that the inner bottom is substantially the same as the lining sides of the converter, only perforated by a number of holes. The total number of orifices through which the blast thus comes is considerable, in order to spread it into numerous streams, the actual number varying with the size of the converter; fora 5-ton converter a dozen or more tuyere bricks, each perforated with about as many holes, are usually employed. The lower plate of the air chamber is removable for the purpose of examining the tuyeres from time to time without removing the entire bottom.

The different portions of the vessel being put together, and the joints well grouted with ganister slip, the whole is gently dried by lighting a small coke fire inside, and by and by increasing this, the blast being turned on gently until the whole vessel is thoroughly dry and hot, when it is ready to receive a charge of molten pig. The blast is communicated to the blast-box by a curved tube reaching thereto from the hollow trunnion box, inside which one of the trunnions of the converter lies; the other trunnion has a cogged wheel or pinion attached, by means of which the vessel can be rotated, a toothed rack gearing into the pinion and being worked directly by a hydraulic press or ram; the rack and press were formerly arranged horizontally, but now are usually placed vertically or slantwise to save space. By means of an automatic valve the blast is shut off when the converter is in an inclined position, so that the level of the mouth is not lower than the tuyere hole then lowest; in this position the molten metal is run in, the elevation of the tuyere holes preventing it from running into them; whilst erecting the converter by means of the rack and pinion before the tuyeres sink below the molten mass, the blast is turned on at a pressure of some 1 '5 atmospheres or more (21 lb per square inch and upwards); the pressure due to the column of molten metal being less than this, the air is forced through it without it being possible for the fused matter to run down into the blast-box. A large hood over the mouth of the converter and connected with a chimney or flue prevents the flame and ejected matter from being scattered about and injuring the workmen.

The ganister preferred for lining is a peculiar silicious deposit found under a thin coal-seam near Sheffield, of almost conchoidal fracture, therein differing from ordinary sandstones, and containing a few tenths per cent., or sometimes a little more, of lime and about the same amount of alumina, with small quantities of iron oxide and alkalies, the rest being silica; analogous substances, however, are found in various other localities, e.g., in the Yorkshire, Northumberland, South Wales, and Shropshire Coal Measures. A well-prepared lining carefully repaired every few days will last several months, and even upwards of a year; the bottoms, however, wear away much more rapidly, the tuyeres either becoming melted or dissolved away by the oxidation of the iron in their vicinity, the oxide produced exerting a marked solvent action on the fireclay and ganister bricks; hence the advantage of Holley’s removable bottoms. A damaged bottom can be removed and a new one put in its place, the joint being made up by ramming in ganister into the crevice whilst screwing up the bolts, without stopping the action of the converter for any lengthened period; whilst with the older vessels it was requisite to cool down somewhat, knock out the damaged tuyere bricks, replace them by others, and ram in ganister between them from the inside, and finally to heat up again by an internal fire before use,·—the whole process causing much delay and waste of fuel, especially as the renewal of some at least of the tuyere bricks is requisite every few blows. In some American works, e.g. , Bethlehem, instead of a rammed ganister lining, one composed of blocks of a peculiar sandstone is employed, set in ganister as mortar for the joints.

Subsidiary Appliances.— The precise mode of aιτangement of Bessemer plant varies in different works, but usually two converters are arranged to be worked together, one casting ladle being used for the pair, worked by a crane. In most of the European works the two converters are on opposite sides of the casting ladle, so that a [9:13:345] large portion of the circle covered by it cannot be used for running ingots into moulds, being occupied by the converters; in most American works the two converters are placed side by side, so as to leave a larger space for the casting bed when the metal is not used direct from the blast furnace. A range of cupolas is fitted up at a convenient distance, some larger for melting the pig, some smaller for the spiegeleisen; the molten metal is either run out from these direct into one or other of the converters through a shoot or gutter of iron lined with fireclay and sand, or is tapped into an intermediate collecting ladle, and when the requisite quantity is collected run rapidly into the converter either by “tipping” the ladle over so that the metal runs out together with some little amount of slag floating on its surface, or by means of a tapping hole at the bottom. This latter arrangement allows the charging of the converter to be more quickly effected; when the iron is tapped directly from the blast furnace into the converter by means of an intermediate ladle, the cupolas are of course unnecessary, save those for melting the spiegeleisen. The blast is generated by an ordinary blowing engine, but at a considerably greater pressure than that used for blast furnaces, 20, 25, and even 30 lb per square inch pressure being employed. The casting ladle into which the contents of the converters are emptied by tilting them up sufficiently when the operation is finished is a large iron bucket lined with clay with a hole at the bottom filled up with a perforated firebrick, into which fits a stopper consisting of a stout iron rod covered with a thick fireclay tube to protect the ro<l from the fused steel; when the ladle is full of molten metal, and the hole is closed by the stopper, the ladle’is swung round by means of a crane over the ingot moulds (of cast iron); the stopper is then lifted, when the fused steel runs out, the scoriae floating on the top of the metal being thus retained and pure steel only poured. Sounder ingots are obtained by running the metal into a cavity communicating by firebrick tubes with the bottoms of the moulds, so as to fill them from below, than by filling them from above directly. Detailed descriptions of the plant employed in various first-class American Bessemer works are given by Holley and Lenox Smith in a series of articles in Engineering, 1877 and following years.

The mode of carrying out the operation is briefly as follows :— the charge of pig iron being ran into the converter, this is swung back into the vertical position, the blast being automatically turned on in so doing; when the blowing is at an end, the converter is turned into a nearly horizontal position, the blast being thereby shut off; a weighed quantity of fused spiegeleisen is then ran in, and the total contents of the converter forthwith poured into the casting ladle; formerly the converter was erected for a few seconds and the blast blown through to mix the spiegeleisen and blown metal, but that is now found to be unnecessary. The ingots are finally reheated and passed through the rolling mills after forging so as to reduce them to rails, bars, plates, &c., as required, the machinery for this purpose being identical in character with that employed for malleable iron (§ 25).

The following analyses illustrate the general composition of “Bessemer steel” as made in different European countries, the first two specimens being prepared by Bessemer’s original process (without addition of spiegeleisen, § 27), and the others by the Bessemer-Mushet combination process (from report of E. Brusewitz to the Swedish iron office, Jern-Kontorets Annuler, 1871, 199).

37. The Basic Process.— On attentively examining the history of the puddling process, especially the improvement effected by Rogers in substituting bottoms of iron coated with fettling of iron oxide for the sand bottoms originally used by Cort, and also the various experiments that have been made during the last dozen years or so both on puddling by machinery and refining and purifying iron, the general conclusion deducible seems to be that when phosphorized metal is in presence of iron oxide in a fused state, or of a melted mixture of iron oxide and ferrous silicate containing an amount of the latter not above a certain limit, the tendency of the phosphorus is to become oxidized and converted into phosphate, which separates in the cinder, leaving a purer iron; whilst on the other hand if the cinder is mainly silicate, especially of the metasilicate or w acid” type (R 2 O, SiO 2 ), the tendency is rather the other way, part of the metallic iron becoming oxidized whilst the phosphate is reduced, thus communicating phosphorus to the remaining iron.^[34. An instructive experiment on this point has been made by Pourcel, A quantity of metal (3 tons) containing 2 '5 per cent, of carbon and 0 ’ 5 of phosphorus was melted in a Siemens-Martin hearth, the scoriae removed, and the atmosphere made highly oxidizing (hot air alone passing); in fifteen minutes jets of carbon oxide were formed, and some of the silicon and iron was oxidized, forming a cinder containing no phosphorus. The bath was then heated up again and the cinder removed; and after some silico-manganeisen (10 per cent, silicon, 20 per cent, manganese) had been added, the oxidation by air alone was proceeded with; at first no carbon oxide was liberated (indicating the preferential oxidation of silicon), but after fifteen minutes more the jets reappeared; the cinder now was found to contain phosphates, the percentage of phosphorus in the metal having become reduced to 0 - 35, indicating that the iron and manganese oxides formed, whilst partly reacting on carbon and chiefly on silicon, nevertheless to some extent attacked the phosphorus. The atmosphere was now made much less powerfully oxidizing by turning on the gas supply as usual; in fifteen· minutes the phosphorus had disappeared from the cinder, and was wholly taken up again by the iron, which now contained 0 ’ 50 per cent, as at first,—showing that prolonged contact with the silicious cinder enabled metallic iron (containing more or less carbon) to reduce the phosphate of this cinder, thus inverting the operation effected during the rapid oxidation of iron set up in the first part of the experiment. ] Accordingly, in the modern ordinary puddling process, especially when machine puddling and regular mechanical agitation are substituted for hand labour, and when plenty of fettling of ferric oxide (not largely silicious) is employed, and in Bell’s and Krupp’s purification processes, phosphorus is largely removed from the pig; whilst on the other hand in the older method of puddling on sand bottoms and in the ordinary Bessemer blowing process the first action of the oxygen of the blast is concentrated rather on the silicon than on the iron (at least so far as the ultimate chemical change is concerned), and in consequence a highly silicious cinder results, so that removal of phosphorus by oxidation becomes impracticable; this result, moreover, is intensified by the nature of the lining material (ganister) used for the converters; similarly, in the Heaton process phosphorus is sometimes removed to a considerable extent and sometimes not, according as the soda produced by the decomposition of the nitrate and the iron oxide formed modify the character of the slag produced by the oxidation of the silicon and formation of silicates, rendering it of an “acid” or “basic” silicious character. Again, according to Riley, when the whole of the iron is reduced in the blast furnace, so that the cinder contains none, or practically none, the pig contains all the phosphorus present; but if the cinder contains unreduced iron to any extent, it also retains a proportionate amount of phosphorus, being then much more basic. The temperature also seems somewhat to influence the reaction of iron oxide on phosphorus and of iron on phosphate; the higher the temperature the more pronounced apparently is the tendency of the metal to retain phosphorus, i.e., the less is the tendency of the phosphorus to oxidize and separate from the metal. Guided by these considerations, Snelus took out a patent in 1872^[35. The idea of employing calcareous and other basic linings to furnaces used for the purification of iron by methods other than the pneumatic process of Bessemer is of considerably older date than 1872; thus such substances were used years ago by Siemens and Chatelier in the earliest experiments on the open-hearth process (§ 39), bauxite being extensively employed then, and also in Siemens’s subsequent direct precipitation process. The use of lime in puddling has often been tried as an addition to the fettling, whilst in the Siemens ore process limestone is usually added as a flux. ] for the use of lime or limestone [9:13:346] as a lining material for the converter, and found that when a “basic” lining of this description was substituted for ganister a removal of phosphorus to a greater or lesser extent was actually brought about in the converter just as it is in the puddling furnace; for some few years, however, this method was not applied on a commercial scale, but subsequently the subject was again examined by Thomas and Gilchrist, who finally succeeded in reducing the principles of Snelus’s patent to successful practical operation, finding that by the use of a “basic” lining to the converter, and especially the addition of a small amount of lime, or lime mixed with “blue billy” or some other form of iron oxide such as mill scale, to the charge together with the continuance of the blow for some short period after the decarbonization is complete, the elimination of phosphorus (even from highly phosphorized pig, containing 1 , 5 to 2Ό per cent, of phosphorus) could be very largely effected, some 80 to 90 per cent, at least of the total phosphorus present becoming oxidized and converted into phosphates, this action chiefly taking place during the “after blow”; provided that the cinder is sufficiently basic, the iron does not oxidize during this after blow as it does in the ordinary “acid lined” converter process. Owing to the success of these operations, the “basic” process has been more frequently spoken of as the “Thomas-Gilchrist process” than as being what it substantially is, the principle of Snelus’s earlier patent in a somewhat but not very largely modified form. Warned probably by the disasters of previous inventors, the rival competitors for the honour (and profit) of the practical production of ingot metal of fair quality from phosphorized pig have coalesced and united their forces, instead of opposing one another in costly litigation.

Processes based upon the general principle of making the cinder of the Bessemer converter more or less “basic,” but considerably different in details from the basic lining method of Snelus, Thomas, and Gilchrist, have been proposed at one time or another by various inventors; thus, in the earlier patents of Bessemer himself, the admixture of steam with air in the blowing operation was included, whilst steam had been previously employed as an adjunct in the refinery, the action being the formation of iron oxide (with evolution of hydrogen). Somewhat analogous uses of steam have been subsequently proposed by others, in some cases the phosphorus being alleged to be evolved as phosphoretted hydrogen (?), e.g., in Bull’s process, in which the ordinary air blowing of a Bessemer converter or the effect of an oxidizing blast in a Siemens hearth, &c., on cast iron is first used to remove silicon and carbon, and then a jet of steam used to remove phosphorus. The direct incorporation of oxide of iron (blue billy, &c. ) alone with the material (by blowing into the converter along with the blast) has also been proposed by Pettitt ( § 24), the object in all cases being to assist the formation of phosphate, and thereby remove phosphorus from the iron by making the cinder highly basic.

During the oxidation of phosphorus a large amount of heat is evolved, so that the temperature rises during the after blow just as it does during the oxidation of silicon. According to various experimenters the heat of combustion of phosphorus is a little short of 6000, so that, as that of silicon is near to 8000, 4 parts of phosphorus are thermally about equivalent to 3 of silicon. Hence if a pig containing 2 per cent, of silicon will furnish sufficient heat to keep the blown metal and slag fluid, the same result will be attained by means of a pig containing about 0 ’ 5 per cent, of silicon and 2Ό per cent, of phosphorus, i.e., if the radiation loss be the same, and also the diminution in heat evolution due to separating the non-metal from the iron,^[36. The experiments of Troost and Hautefeuille show that this is not the case, the heat evolution during the union of silicon and iron being much less than that taking place when phosphorus and iron combine together; so that considerably more than four parts of phosphorus would be requisite to produce the same amount of heat as three of silicon if both non-metals are severally combined with iron. ] as well as the fusibility of the slag. In actual practice the “basic” method is found to take a little longer time than the ordinary “acid” blow, so that the radiation loss is a little greater; the calcareous cinder too is somewhat less fusible than the ferrous silicate cinder of the ordinary ganister-lined converter ; so that a practical inconvenience is apt to be occasioned owing to the frothy mass of imperfectly fused cinder formed foaming up to the mouth of the converter and there solidifying, whilst the greater extent of the foaming causes more material to be ejected than is usual with the ordinary converters. To remedy this, it has been proposed to add the basic matter in a highly heated or even molten state, and to make the air used for blowing traverse a chamber filled with coke on to which petroleum is allowed to drop, so that combustible vapours are blown into the converter along with the air, thus raising the temperature considerably, and preventing the blocking of the converter-mouth by solidification of cinder, and the production of metal too little heated to remain fluid during the pouring of the ingots, and consequently solidifying in the ladle forming a “skull.” Wilks finds that the action of this arrangement is very satisfactory and effective in preventing “cold blows” from occurring. The same result is also producible by means of coal dust or other freely divided combustible matter blown in along with the blast.

With silicious pig iron the lining is apt to be attacked by the silica formed during the first part of the blowing operations; this is partly but not wholly avoided by the addition of heated lime to the charge. Harmet has proposed, and at Witkowitz attempts have been made, to blow phosphorized and siliciuretted pig successively in two converters, one acid-lined for removing silicon and carbon, and the other basic-lined to get rid of the phosphorus, the blown metal being transferred from the one to the other; much cooling of the metal was thus produced, and the operation was prolonged some fifteen minutes, so that the method was speedily abandoned.

According to Tiinner, in order to produce 100 parts of pure ingots of blown metal 122'5 parts of pig are requisite with “basic” converters, and only 118 , 7 with the ordinary “acid” ones (waste in remelting being included in each case; when the metal is used direct from the blast furnace, only 112 parts are required with acid converters); hence an extra loss of nearly 4 per cent, of metal is experienced in the basic process. The following analyses, by Miiller, of specimens taken during a prolonged investigation at Hörde illustrate the non-removal of phosphorus and sulphur during the earlier part of the blow, and indeed their slight increase (in percentage amount) owing to the oxidation of manganese, silicon, and carbon; and also the rapid removal of phosphorus during the after-blow :—
[table]

The composition of the slag produced during the basic process differs greatly from that of the ordinary method; the following analyses illustrate the difference :—
[table]
[9:13:347]

The phosphoric anhydride in the basic process slag appears to exist as calcium phosphate, and not as iron phosphate; for after roasting to peroxidize iron, no soluble phosphate is dissolved out on digestion with ammonium sulphide, nor is any formed by fusion with sodium chloride, whilst sulphurous acid solution readily dissolves out phosphate (Pattinson and Stead).

Basic Lining Material.— Some of the earliest of Bessemer's experiments (made at Dowlais) on his air-blowing process were made with a converter lined with Stourbridge firebrick, and in this vessel a Bessemer metal was made which contained only minute quantities of carbon and silicon, and much less phosphorus than the batches subsequently prepared from the same phosphorized Welsh pig in other converters lined with ganister, the non-success of which substances as commercial products (owing to their brittleness due to the phosphorus present) ultimately led to the use of haematite and other phosphorus-free pig only for Bessemerizing. Without doubt the superiority of the earliest samples was due to the less silicious character of the brick lining. The lining materials used by Snelus in his experiments on the subject were lime and limestone, especially magnesian limestone; those first employed by Thomas and Gilchrist were crushed limestone and sodium silicate solution added so as to moisten the limestone, which was then rammed into the converter like ganister. Bricks made of a limestone containing some aluminous silicate and fired at a very high temperature were then employed, but were found to be subject to disintegration by moisture when kept in stock; magnesian limestone bricks containing a littje silica and alumina similarly prepared answered much better. Riley has found that freshly burnt pretty pure magnesian limestone mixed with about 10 or 15 per cent, of crude petroleum can be rammed into converters or moulded by hydraulic pressure into bricks, the substance in either case becoming compact and hard upon firing, so as to present a very durable lining material. Instead of petroleum, crude shale oil, resin oil, or tar may be used to moisten the lime. The bricks thus prepared do not slake or disintegrate on keeping, or even if immersed in water, provided they have been fired at a high temperature; in this case they contract slightly, whereas if only comparatively slightly heated they do not materially diminish in volume on firing.^[37. For further details respecting the working of the Snelus-Thomas-Gilchrist process, see various papers in the Journal I. and S. Inst., 1879 and 1-880, and in Iran, &c. ]

38. The Uchatius Process.— In the process of puddling (§ 23) the oxidation of the carbon and other impurities oi the pig iron is essentially effected by oxide of iron incorporated mechanically with the fluxed mass, and derived either from the oxidation of part of the iron of the pig, or from the fettling, or both. By fusing down in crucibles a mixture of small fragments of pig iron and ferric oxide of tolerable purity in suitable proportions it might therefore be expected that the percentage of carbon of the iron would be reduced so that a steel would result, a portion of the iron oxide added becoming simultaneously reduced to the metallic state; this experiment was actually made by Reaumur upwards of a century ago; the reaction forms the foundation of the Uchatius process, patented in 1855. In order to obtain a usable steel, the iron oxide employed should also contain manganese oxide; the product of the continued roasting of a manganiferous spathic ore answers well. Independently of the costliness of crucible operations, however, as compared with other modes of production, the method is open to objection on the score of the practical difficulty in exactly regulating the degree of carbonization of the resulting steel, and also in its requiring a tolerably pure pig iron in the first place, so that, like the Bessemer process.proper, it is unsuited for the production of steel from many classes of iron. The method has, however, been employed on a manufacturing scale in Sweden, the non-phosphorized charcoal smelted from Swedish magnetite being employed along with some of the crushed ore; whilst a modification of the process, in which an open hearth heated by a regenerative furnace is employed instead of crucibles, has been employed of late years by Siemens (see § 39), and is usually known as the “ore process” for open hearth steel making. At Wikmans-hytta in Sweden a few years ago various qualities of steel were prepared from the richest Bispberg mine ores stamped fine and intermixed with pig iron granulated by running into a rapidly revolving wheel in a water tank. Only hard steel for miners’ picks, cutting tools, razors, dies, <fcc., were thus prepared, containing 0 ’ 7 to 1 ’ 3 per cent, of carbon, about 50 B> being melted in each crucible at one operation; the crucibles lasted longer than in ordinary cast steel making, usually for some half dozen heats.

Rostaing effected the granulation of the iron by running the melted pig on to a rapidly revolving horizontal cast iron disk, so that the liquid was scattered around (by centrifugal action) in globules which solidified into a kind of iron shot; these being sifted into tolerably uniform sizes admitted of the production of a more nearly homogeneous metal than would otherwise have been obtained. The principles of Uchatius and Rostaing’s patents, however, were long previously known and even patented; thus in 1761 J. Wood obtained a patent for reducing iron “into small grains (according to art) by pouring it into water upon a wheel or roller turned briskly round,” and for decarbonizing the granulated metal by fusing with various fluxes, &c., including iron cinder, scales, and scoriae; whilst Mushet has described, as being in use long ago at Cyfartha, a method of granulating iron by pouring on to a revolving horizontal stone in a water trough molten pig iron, stating that the granulated metal was fused with oxide of iron in the form of bloomery cinders, and thereby rendered less easily fusible and capable of welding,— in short, that it was decarbonized to a greater or lesser extent.

The method of purification or refining of pig iron proposed by Bell (§ 24) is substantially the Uchatius process applied on a large scale and at a somewhat lower temperature, with mechanical agitation and interruption at a certain stage. By stopping the process when the action has only gone on sufficiently long to oxidize the majority of the silicon and phosphorus without materially affecting the carbon, a refined cast iron is produced; whilst, were somewhat more carbon removed by longer action, a kind of Uchatius steel would result.

Ellershausen' s process consisted in running molten pig iron upon a bed of iron oxide, sprinkling ore on the surface, and running on another layer of pig iron, and so on until a mass of alternate layers of pig and oxide is formed; on heating this the pig gradually becomes decarbonized, the reaction being in fact a kind of modification of the “malleable cast iron” process described in § 22. Finally the mass is forged and rolled. The results obtained were not uniformly satisfactory, whilst the fuel consumption was found to be large; accordingly the method never became anything much more than an experimental process.

39. The Siemens-Martin Process.— As already stated, this process in its original form is substantially the method patented by Heath in 1845, with the addition of the use of a regenerative furnace, and of certain improvements in the working details, &c., the effect of which jointly is just to convert a practically useless process into a most valuable working method. Fig. 5 represents the kind of furnace employed. Since the date of Heath’s patent the fusion of steel by means of a fan blast in an open hearth (under a layer of molten glass to protect from the oxidizing action of the flame which was the main cause of failure in Heath’s original process) was experimented upon by Sudre and a commission from the French emperor (consisting of Deville, Beaulieu, and Caron) at the Montataire ironworks, with the result of showing that, whilst the operation could be readily effected and a good tool steel prepared, the practical difficulties in the way, especially the corrosion of the furnace and the great cost of the requisite fuel, rendered the process commercially of but little value. In 1863, however, Chatelier attempted to prepare cast steel by puddling a good pig iron so as to form a very mild puddled steel, and then fusing it, not in crucibles, but on ’ the hearth of a furnace containing molten pig and fitted on the regenerative principle. To enable the hearth to resist the high temperature it was composed of a bed of bauxite, a material highly suitable, so far as infusibility and the absence of injurious ingredients are concerned, but open to the objection of not indurating properly, and consequently becoming dislodged and floating up to the surface of the fused mass; this inconvenience was subsequently remedied by mixing the bauxite with a 1 per cent, solution oi calcium chloride, moulding the paste into bricks, and calcining them, whereby a highly refractory coherent bottom can be obtained. Siemens, however, prefers {Chem. Soc. Journal· [9:13:348] 1868, 279) to use a silicious sand of a particular degree of fusibility (such as that from Gornal near Birmingham, or Fontainebleau sand with an admixture of about 25 per cent of common red sand); this, being introduced dry into the furnace in a layer of about an inch in thickness, is fritted by increasing the heat up to a full steelmelting temperature; another similar layer is then introduced and fritted down again, and so on until the hearth is made into a shallow basin sloping towards the tapping hole. The experiments of Chatelier not being attended with the desired success in the first instance, the subject was taken up by E. & P. Martin, who subsequently introduced certain improvements in details, such as the use of particular fluxes to cover the surface of the molten metal, the application of a separate furnace for heating the iron before introducing it into the melting chamber, the employment of particular brands of iron, &c.

Under the names of “Siemens process” and “Siemens-Martin process” are usually included several different modifications. In what may be called the older or original process, which was essentially the combination of pig iron and malleable iron fused together in a regenerative furnace hearth, the same kind of difficulty was met with that nearly proved fatal to Bessemer’s original process, viz., that it is difficult if not impracticable to make sure of obtaining any required degree of carbonization of the resulting steel, so that the finer classes of steels cannot readily be thus made; for rails, however, the process has been largely adopted. Much the same way of overcoming the difficulty was adopted in the Siemens-Martin process as was used by Mushet, thus giving the second modification, viz., making the atmosphere slightly oxidizing, and continuing the heating until the metal is decarbonized, when the required amount of carbon is added in the form of spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese, and the steel forthwith cast. This modification is consequently substantially the refining process formerly adopted as a preliminary stage to puddling (§ 23) carried out a great deal further (so as wholly to decarbonize the metal) at a much higher temperature, and differs from the Bessemer blowing process mainly in this that the oxygen requisite to burn off the carbon and oxidize silicon, &c., is made to play over the surface of the fused mass instead of passing through it. The decarbonization is carried out in precisely the same way (so far as principle is concerned) as that by which the oxidation of lead and base metal is effected in the ordinary process of gold and silver cupellation in an oxidizing atmosphere at a high temperature. These modifications, of which the second is now much the more largely adopted, are generally referred to as the “Siemens-Martin” process, or “Martin process.” A third modification is substantially the Uchatius process carried out in a regenerative hearth instead of a crucible; this is known as the “Siemens process” or “ore process,” and consists in melting haematite pig, or other pig iron free from sulphur and phosphorus, and then adding in small quantities at a time an equally pure ore until a sample taken out from time to time does not harden on plunging into water whilst still red hot; to the fused iron spiegeleisen, &c., is then added as before; in this way a somewhat larger quantity of steel is obtained from a given amount of pig, the ore becoming partly reduced whilst oxidizing carbon and silicon, &c.; but this advantage is counterbalanced by the greater wear and tear owing to the larger amount of cinder formed and its corrosive action on the brickwork, and by the necessity for using somewhat more fuel. A fourth modification consists in a sort of combination of the Martin method and the ore process, the pig and scrap, &c., being fused together and the decarbonization being then effected, not by oxidation by the gases alone, but by that together with ore added to the mass.

When Siemens’s precipitation process (§ 31) is used, or when the ore is reduced to spongy metal in a rotating furnace, &c. (§ 30), the resulting iron is readily converted into steel by simply adding it instead of malleable scrap to the fused pig in the above process,— spongy metal when thus employed being made up into a sort of ball by stirring it up with fused magnetite, and the whole added to the fused pig; another variety of combination of “ore process” and ordinary Siemens-Martin process is thus obtained, the finishing up of the metal by adding spiegeleisen, &c., in known quantity when complete decarbonization has been effected being the same in all cases. An analogous modification is that of Blair, who first prepares spongy iron by reducing the ore in much the same fashion as in Chenot’s process (§ 30), and then fuses it up in a regenerative furnace with more or less pig to give a fluid bath to begin with.

In the ordinary working of the process when ore is not used, the materials employed are pig iron (free from sulphur and phosphorus) and malleable scrap of various kinds, together with scrap and waste Bessemer steel, crop ends of rails, &c. The pig being melted and the malleable iron raised to nearly a white heat (either in a separate furnace or by the waste gases before passing to the regenerator), the latter is gradually added to the former until the whole is liquid; the heating is then continued, the flame being made somewhat oxidizing so as to gradually decarbonize the metal, until a sample of the metal drawn and cooled in water is scarcely hardened thereby; at this stage the metal is virtually molten decarbonized iron, all silicon, manganese, and carbon having been removed by oxidation. To give the requisite steel character, a definite quantity of spiegeleisen is added (or of ferro-manganese when a larger relative percentage of manganese is desired, or in certain cases of silico-manganeisen when silicon is wanted to be present), and the whole cast into ingots. Pig iron alone can be used in the first instance, only then a longer time is requisite to effect decarbonization. The following analyses by A. Willis illustrate the relative-rates at which the oxidation of manganese, silicon, and carbon is effected, the quantity of the last not suffering any material diminution until the others have almost disappeared :—
[table]

When pure ores are used in the ore process, no appreciable alteration takes place in the percentage of sulphur in the pig and scrap, but if sulphates (e.g., barium sulphate) be present in the ore, the resulting steel contains more sulphur than the pig and scrap used to the extent of about 30 per cent, of the sulphur present in the ore (Willis). When ferro-manganese is used to finish the process and prepare a soft steel, the requisite quantity of ferro-manganese is heated up either on the bed between the hearth proper and the regenerators on which the materials are heated up by waste heat or otherwise without fusion; when spiegeleisen is used, the requisite quantity may either be added in the same way, or fused in a cupola and then added; burning out of more or less carbon and manganese is always a possibility where a cupola is used, wherefore when possible the spiegeleisen is fused in the hearth itself or its adjuncts. In order to obtain the best castings at Terre Noire, the decarbonized metal is treated with siliconeisen, and then allowed to remain for some twenty minutes in as nearly neutral an atmosphere as possible, so that cinder may completely be separated by gravitation and the reaction of the silicon on the carbon oxide may be complete (§ 44); the ferro-manganese is then added, and the casting proceeded with.

In the Siemens-Martin process (where ore is not used) the yield of steel finally obtained is somewhat below the weight of metal originally employed, owing to oxidation; in the ore process, on the other hand, a larger weight of steel is ultimately obtained than that of the metal used, owing to the reduction of iron from the ore. The consumption of fuel per ton of ingot steel is, however, somewhat higher in the ore process, owing to the larger quantity of slag. According to Gautier a considerable loss of fuel results if the gas producers are not placed close to the steel furnaces, even to the extent of one-third in some cases; probably this figure is a little overestimated (see § 10).

In order to avoid the necessity of decarbonizing completely the metal and then recarbonizing by addition of spiegeleisen or ferromanganese, which is practically entailed by the difficulty experienced in finding out the exact composition of the partially decarbonized metal at any given stage of the operation, it has been proposed by Ryder to sample the steel and cast the sample into a small ingot of definite size and shape, and then to determine the magnetic qualities developed in the ingot by the influence of a powerful electromagnet, using a particular apparatus devised for the purpose. In this way a fairly correct estimate of the amount of residual carbon is obtained, rendering it unnecessary to prolong the operation of decarbonization further when the test shows that an amount is present sufficient to give a steel of the required quality on addition of a known amount of ferro-manganese. In the inventor’s hands the method has been found to work successfully, enabling the open hearth operations to be considerably shortened as to duration. An improved form of apparatus for the purpose has also been described by Wattenhofem

40. The Pernot and Ponsard Furnaces and Allied A])ρliances.— The Pernot furnace as applied to steel making differs in no material respect from the Pernot puddling furnace; it is substantially a Siemens-Martin furnace with a rotating bed. The hearth is a saucer-shaped cavity supported by an iron frame, mounted on the top of a slightly inclined nearly vertical axis, and running on wheels upon a rail or guide supported on a stout bogie (fig. 62). When in position the hearth is just under a dome or roof, which is perforated with orifices for the entrance and exit of the [9:13:349] gas and blast and exit gases passing to the regenerators; as the furnace revolves the liquid metal always forms a pool at the lowest portion, but any solid matter is carried round, alternately rising above the pool and being plunged beneath it; the effect of this is greatly to facilitate melting down and also considerably to shorten the time requisite for oxidizing out the carbon. At the required stage of decarbonization the blast and gas supply are shut off, the spiegeleisen or ferro-manganese added, and the bogie withdrawn carrying with it the hearth and metal; or it may be tapped in situ, and removed only for repairs (relining, fettling, &c.).

Comparing the working of a furnace of this kind with one of similar dimensions but fixed bed, Hackney found that the output of steel was about double in a given time, and the coal used per unit weight of steel was less than one half, viz., 0 - 40 to 0 ’ 43 instead of 0∙90 (8 to 8⅜ cwts. per ton instead of 18 cwts. ). At St Chamond an improved Pernot 7-ton furnace gave during three months working the following results per unit of ingot steel :—
[table]

The metal used per unit of ingot steel was 1Ό6, the output being about 21 tons per day of twenty-four hours, the conversion taking about seven hours per charge. In English works where the Siemens process (“ore process ”) is used with fixed hearths the yield of steel is somewhat in excess of the metal used originally, but the time of working is inferior to that just mentioned, the yield with 5-ton furnaces being only some 14 tons per twenty-four hours.

Holley states that the removable Pernot furnaces set up in America (especially at Springfield, where 20-ton hearths have been recently erected) are highly satisfactory, especially as regards the ease with which repairs can be made; the hearth can be run out on Saturday night, and is cool enough to repair on Sunday; firing up being commenced on Sunday night, the furnace is ready for the usual charge on Monday forenoon. Krupp’s dephosphorizing pro cess is adopted to purify the pig before finishing in the Pernot hearth, the metal being run from the melting cupolas into the Krupp washing furnace, and thence into the steel furnace by means of a ladle. Essentially the Pernot furnace is an ingenious combination of various previously well-known principles, the rotating circular bed having been previously used not only for puddling iron, but also for roasting ores, and the withdrawing can·iage having also been employed previously in the manufacture of armour plates, whilst the inclined axis had also been previously used.

7‰ Berard Process.— This method is essentially a sort of combination of the Bessemer converter principle and of the open-hearth method. A double furnace is employed, heated by gas, and provided with movable tubes dipping into the melted metal, or with a tuyere at the base in the case of the first hearth, in which the metal is blown, and the carbon, &c., oxidized by means of an air-blast; in the fellow hearth the metal is partially recarbonized by the gases from coal similarly blown into it, the object being to facilitate the removal of sulphur and phosphorus. ' Finally the purified metal is treated with spiegeleisen or ferromanganese in the usual way.

PonsardFurnace orForno-Convertisseur.— This apparatus is essentially a combination of the Pernot furnace with the Bessemer converter, consisting of a hearth movable about an obliquely vertical axis (figs. 63, 64). Instead of rotating round and round on this axis, the hearth D only moves through half a revolution; when in one position (as indicated in fig. 63) the surface of the molten metal is above the level of a series of tuyeres O fed by a blast pipe LMN; under these circumstances the apparatus performs the functions of a Bessemer converter, the blast passing through the molten metal; when it is half turned round, the tuyeres are raised above the surface of the metal and the blast is shut off, so that it then becomes an ordinary Siemens open hearth. The air blast is introduced, as in the Bessemer converter, through a hollow axis of rotation; the hearth is fixed, as in the Pernot furnace, upon a carriage or bogie K, so that it can be withdrawn and the metal tapped out at the tapping hole P. A gas producer A is attached, the gases from which are burnt as they are formed without cooling by passing through a long pipe, <fcc., or heating by a regenerator; the air used to burn them, however, is heated by a regenerative arrangement consisting of a pair of chambers H filled with brick stacked in a peculiar way; through one chamber the waste flame passes by the flue EFG, heating it up; through the other one used alternately the air passes reaching the furnace by the flue CC. F is a chamber in the waste gas flue for the deposition of solid suspended matters, dust, &c., from the blowing operation[9:13:350], and G is a small bed for heating scrap, &c., before its introduction into the main hearth D. Owing to the regenerator only heating up the blast, the waste gases escape at a much higher temperature than with a Siemens regenerator; accordingly they may be advantageously utilized to produce steam.

According to Perissé (from whose paper— J r ourn, I. and S. Inst., 1878, 459—the cuts, figs. 63 and 64 are taken) the average duration of a blow and subsequent operations in a 5-ton furnace is five to six hours when the metal is charged cold, whilst six to eight operations may be made in twenty-four hours when it is previously melted in a spare hearth; 250 kilos (about 5 cwts.) of Mons coal were consumed per hour, or about 6 tons per twenty-four hours for 20 tons and upwards of production (charged cold), or for 30 to 40 tons (charged with fluid metal). Phosphorus is not materially eliminated, because, as in the ordinary Bessemer and Siemens-Martin hearths, there is a silicious flux always present, owing to the nature of the lining; this objection, however, is readily remediable by simply using a “basic” lining (§ 37), when more or less complete dephosphorization results, just as is the case with the Pernot hearth when a large amount of fussd iron oxide is added, as in Krupp’s dephosphorizing process.

By omitting the movable bed, and substituting the ordinary fixed bed of a reheating furnace, the Ponsard forno-convertisseur becomes changed into the Ponsard reheating furnace; the advantages of this form of arrangement over that of Siemens’s reheater are said to be considerable saving of cost in construction and capability of producing steam by the waste heat.

4L Manufacture of Spiegeleisen and Ferro-manganese and Allied Substances.— In all the above combination processes which are successfully worked, the final stage is almost invariably the addition to more or less completely decarbonized molten iron of carbonized manganiferous iron in definite proportion, so as to communicate a known amount of carbon (and also of manganese) to the mixture; accordingly the preparation of Mangan eisen (as such substances may be conveniently termed) is an important step in the steel making processes. When highly manganiferous iron ores, such as the Styrian spathose ores, are smelted in the ordinary way in a blast furnace, a large fraction of the manganese is not reduced, but passes away in the cinder; by using a larger amount of fuel relatively to the burden, however, the quantity of manganese reduced and obtained in the pig iron is increased; the hotter the blast the greater the richness in manganese of the pig, at least with the ores used in the Siegen district. At Nijne Tajilsk (Urals) a ferruginous manganese dioxide occurs of the following composition :—
[table]

From this a fine brand of spiegeleisen is smelted. At Schisshyttan (Sweden) occurs a mixture of magnetite, manganiferous garnet, and knebelite (silicate of iron and manganese), of which mixed ore the average composition is
[table]

Of late years this has been extensively used for manufacturing spiegeleisen (chiefly used for Swedish Bessemer iron) containing about 4 per cent, carbon and upwards of 10 of manganese, sometimes 15 or even more per cent, being present. These higher manganiferous irons show little or no magnetic action.

During the early period of the development of the fused steel industry, the richer manganeisens (containing 15 per cent, and upward of manganese) used for crucible steels were themselves prepared in crucibles, the term “ferro-manganese” being applied to these products, “spiegeleisen” indicating the less manganiferous pig containing some 6 or 7 per cent, of manganese prepared in the blast furnace; subsequently, however, the blast furnace spiegeleisens of commerce were prepared much richer in manganese than formerly, whilst ferro-manganese of 30 and upwards per cent, of manganese came into use prepared by Henderson’s method, viz., by reducing upon the open hearth of a Siemens furnace a mixture of manganese carbonate (obtained from bleaching powder residues or “still-liquor ”) and ferric oxide in presence of excess of carbon, a neutral or slight reducing flame being employed. The furnace bottom is made of coke ground up and consolidated, so as virtually to form a large carbon shallow crucible or basin,—the finely divided mixture being put in and the temperature raised to a low red heat for some hours. A metallic sponge is obtained which subsequently runs down to a regulus when the temperature is raised to a full white. An important influence in the amount of manganese [9:13:351] reduced and contained in the final alloy is exerted by silica; if much of that substance be present the product is comparatively poor in manganese, a green slag (mainly manganese silicate) being formed; a very high temperature too is essential; of late years blast furnace manganeιsens have almost superseded these open hearth products. Alloys containing 25, 50, 75, and even more per cent, of manganese are usually employed in the manufacture of so-called extra soft steels (or more properly fused irons), the use of spiegeleisen being in such cases inadmissible inasmuch as too high a degree of carbonization would be effected if sufficient spiegeleisen were added to communicate as much manganese as is desired to be present; thus at Terre Noire, where the preparation of ferro-manganese has been extensively experimented with and adopted, only about 1'5 parts of 45 per cent, manganeisen are added to 100 of the decarbonized product from the Siemens-Martin hearth or Bessemer converter, thus communicating some 0 - 7 per cent, of manganese with less than 0Ί per cent of carbon; whereas were spiegeleisen used at 8 per cent, manganese only, either the carbon percentage λvould be far too great, or the manganese λvould be too low to give the particular physical qualities required. For the manufacture of spiegeleisen the franklinite of New Jersey (essentially a compound of ferric oxide with oxides of zinc and manganese) has been long utilized, being first heated with anthracite so as to reduce and distil off most of the zinc (the vapour of which is allowed to oxidize, the resulting oxide being collected), and then smelted in small blast furnaces with anthracite and limestone flux with a large excess of fuel (about three times the weight of spiegeleisen run or more).

According to Snelus {Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1874, C8) the best results are obtained when a certain quantity of manganese remains unreduced and escapes in the slag, which should have about the following composition to give the best results :—

constituting a green vitreous smooth mass of conchoidal fracture. The composition of the charges introduced into the furnace must be calculated out so as to give about this amount of manganese unreduced together with that reduced in relation to the other constituents respectively; thus from the following average composition of charge the annexed slag and spiegeleisen result :—

Much more richly manganiferous metals than this have been obtained in the blast furnace by W. G. Ward (Cartersville, Georgia) by simply increasing the amount of lime added, and employing a smaller burden; in this way ferro-manganese of upwards of 50 per cent, has been manufactured readily, about three-fifths of the manganese in the charge being reduced. Analogous metals have been obtained by many other smelters; thus specimens of ferro-manganese containing upwards of 80 per cent, of manganese and prepared in the o blast furnace were exhibited in the Paris exhibition. According to Akermann, to produce ferro-manganese of 85 per cent, in the blast furnace is a matter of no great difficulty, but the consumption of coke is about four times greater than that required for common pig iron, whilst the daily output is only about one-fourth of that of the latter. No advantage attends the production of manganeisen of upwards of about 80 percent., but rather the contrary, richer metal being very brittle. It is noteworthy that, notwithstanding the use of much more fuel in a furnace smelting rich manganeisen, the escaping gases do not contain more carbon oxide than (and often not as much as) those of an ordinary blast furnace, the extra oxygen in the carbon dioxide escaping coming from the higher oxides of manganese employed as manganese ores. A description of the older modes of producing spiegeleisen in Germany is given in a report by Wiborg to the Swedish iron office {Jern-Kontorets Annalcr, 1870; also in abstract in Journal I. and S. Inst., 1872, 138).

When lime fluxes are employed, it is indispensable that they should not contain phosphorus; thus the spiegeleisen prepared in New Jersey from franklinite was found to contain phosphorus to a decidedly prejudicial extent when oyster shells were employed as flux, but ceased to do so when good limestone was used instead. It is noteworthy, however, that when a highly manganiferous iron is smelted a considerably larger preparation of phosphorus finds its way into the cinder and less into the pig than is the case when the resulting pig contains less manganese; and the same remark is also largely true of sulphur.

According to several chemists and metallurgists as the percentage of manganese in manganeisen increases, so, roughly speaking, that of carbon decreases; so that whilst spiegeleisen of 7 or 8 per cent, manganese usually contains some 4 or 5 per cent, of carbon and sometimes more, ferromanganese of 20 per cent, manganese contains much less carbon, and when the manganese attains to 30 per cent, and upwards the carbon becomes diminished to something below 1 per cent., being often as low as 0 ’ 4 or even 0 ’ 25 per cent. (Henderson). Others, however, have obtained diametrically opposite results; thus Riley and Grüner both find that the carbon percentage increases pari passu with that of manganese. The peculiar large mirror-like crystals from which the term “spiegeleisen” (mirror iron) is derived are not exhibited by ferro-manganese containing large amounts of manganese.

By mixing finely divided iron (sponge, filings, turnings of cast or wrought iron or steel, &c.) with finely powdered ores of manganese, tungsten, or titanium, or with quartz in suitable quantity, moistening with dilute acid or ammoniacal solution, and compressing into lumps, hard masses are formed (after standing a few hours) which can be heated to a red heat without breaking up. By melting these in a small cupola furnace with a crucible or hearth of alumina, magnesia, or lime, or of hard carbon and a tuyere letting in a hot blast just above the top of the hearth, manganeisens and siliconeisens containing up to 75 per cent, of manganese or 22 per cent, of silicon, or iron-tungsten or iron-titanium alloys, or ternary alloys can be readily produced {Chronique de l , Industrie, 1873, ii. 235).

The following analyses illustrate the composition of various kinds of spiegeleisen, ferro-manganese, and allied products:—

Silicoηciseη.— In order to produce highly silicious iron, according to Jordan, the main conditions are that the blast shall be extremely hot, the furnace not driving rapidly, and that the charge whilst containing much silica shall be highly aluminous and not markedly calcareous. An accident at the Heardt iron-works, Dusseldorf, necessitated the shutting off of the majority of the blast, three tuyeres instead of six being used, and the pressure being reduced from 15-18 to about 10 centimetres of mercury {i.e., from about 3 1 to 1'9 lb per square inch); the blast became highly heated (from 500° to 600® C.), whilst the burden was increased, the charge containing 12⅜ cwts. ore at 38 per cent, iron, 6 cwts. limestone, and 10 cwts. coke, so that the slag contained silica 50, lime 33, alumina 16, manganese oxide 1, the coke being 42 cwts. per ton of iron. Under these conditions a pig was run containing silicon 7 9, phosphorus 0 ’ 72, and carbon 2 ’ 60 per cent. Analogous results as regards increased percentage of silicon on decreasing lime and increasing alumina relatively to the silicon have been observed in various other instances. Troost and Hautefeuille consider that the presence of alkaline silicates in the furnace promotes the siliconizing of the iron,—the alkali metals formed at a high temperature by the reduction of the alkalies reacting whilst still nascent on the silica, and thus reducing it; a mixture of potassium carbonate, charcoal, iron [9:13:352] filings, and silica melted in a wind furnace affords a cast iron containing 15-16 per cent, of silicon and nearly 3 per cent, carbon; lime or calcium silicate on the other hand removes silicon from silicious iron when the two are melted together. It is a matter of usual belief that silicon expels sulphur from pig iron; at any rate the conditions most favourable to production of highly silicious pig are not so favourable to the presence of sulphur, and hence grey silicious pig is much less sulphurized than white pig made from the same materials. According to Riley the greater the percentage of silicon in siliconeisen the smaller is the amount of carbon present, so that when 15 or 20 per cent, of silicon is present the carbon is reduced to a very small amount Silicon- Manganeisen. — Silicious spiegeleisen (or manganese silicide, as it is sometimes termed) is prepared by the ordinary blast furnace methods of making rich spiegeleisens by increasing the amount of silica present and using large amounts of fuel. For the purpose of preventing “blowholes” in cast soft steels containing but little carbon, an alloy containing about 8 per cent, of silicon, 14-15 of manganese, and about 1 ’ 3 per cent, of carbon, has been extensively used at Terre Noire. The steel thus produced gave the following numbers (Euverte, Bulletin Soc. des Ing. Civ., 1877):—

Chromium-steel, or “ Chromeisen, ” as it may conveniently be termed, is closely allied to manganeisen; the capabilities of this substance for the most part yet remain undeveloped, but the effect of the chromium is analogous in some respects to that of manganese, in others to that of carbon, communicating a fine close texture with hardness and brittleness when present in any quantity. Chromeisens containing 10 per cent, and upwards of chromium have been prepared by crucible operations, and of somewhat less richness in the blast furnace from ores containing a notable amount of chrome ironstone; Sergius Kern obtained a very hard chromeisen containing 74 per cent, of chromium and 25 of iron by heating chrome ironstone and charcoal powder in graphite crucibles. The Tasmanian Iron Company produced from Tasmanian ores a pig containing some 6 or 7 per cent, of chromium and 4 of carbon; • according to Riley a mixture of this pig with ordinary haematite pig (half and half) would not puddle well, being incapable of welding and forming a bloom on account of the thick cinder; with less chromeisen (one-tenth) the puddling period was prolonged; a little of the chromium remained unoxidized in the iron without materially _ affecting its qualities; at first the ordinary grey pig melted whilst the chromium pig remained unfused. By melting chromium pig containing upwards of 0 , 2 per cent, of sulphur with ferro-manganese, the sulphur becomes almost entirely eliminated, the resulting product only containing 0 ‘035 per cent.; on adding it (in a fused state) to blown Bessemer metal a product was obtained not at all resembling good manganiferous Bessemer steel, as it crumbled under the hammer at a red heat. The experience of a Sheffield firm as to the tempering qualities of chromium steel has been very unsatisfactory; and Boussingault states that he was unable to give to iron any of the useful properties of steel by adding chromium unless carbon were also present; on the other hand, it has been stated that in America mining tools made of chromium steel have been found to be more durable than any others, the tempering being readily managed. Yet again, R. Brown finds that by adding potassium dichromate to blown Bessemer metal or other varieties of steel a certain amount of chromium is reduced and counteracts the evil effects of phosphorus, steel so made being capable of being bent and twisted cold even though containing as much as 1 per cent, of phosphorus; thus samples of steel so prepared gave the following numerical results (Joum. I. and S. Inst., 1879. 3551

Tungstcn-steels have been often brought forward as possessing valuable properties, but do not appear to have been largely manufactured in England. On the Continent they have attracted more attention; thus Biermann of Hanover has prepared ferro-tungsten containing from 20 to 50 per cent., of tungsten and a few parts per cent, of manganese with the object of using the composition in the same way as ferro-manganese, i.e., intermixing it with larger amounts of decarbonized iron so as to obtain a tungsteniferous steel of known composition. Griiner states that the hardness of steel is increased by addition of tungsten almost indefinitely, but that when more than 2 or 3 per cent, is present the metal becomes brittle from extreme hardness; for lathe tools steel up to 8 per cent, tungsten may be used provided they be submitted only to a mild oil tempering, for with water they would fly to pieces; thus a hook tool used in a steel tire shop of the West of France Railway Company cbntained
[table]

In the manufacture of such steels the tungsten is introduced either as a triple manganese alloy (prepared on a Siemens hearth or in the blast furnace like ferro-manganese) or as crude fritted metallic tungsten obtained by reducing wolfram with a mixture of coal and tar, &c.

Levallois has patented in France the use of ternary nickeltungsten-iron alloys containing
[table]

They are said to be very hard, but can be worked like ordinary cast steel; they are prepared by putting the tungsten and nickel into a small soft iron tube together with a little flux (composed of 9 parts boric anhydride and 8 each of calcined quartz and washed calcium carbonate), and placing the tube in the midst of the rest of the iron in a crucible, the surface being covered with some of the flux. When melted up, the whole is poured into moulds in the usual way.

Manganese Bronze.— By melting ferro-manganese and copper together, or preferably mixing the two metals separately fused, all traces of oxide disseminated through the copper are removed by the agency of the readily oxidizable manganese, and a close-grained tough alloy results, capable of very many useful applications. The percentage of iron in the alloys usually prepared, however, being but small, the description of these products more properly belongs to the metallurgy of copper and manganese.

IX. Physical Qualities of Iron and Steel in their Practical Relationships.

42. Hardening, Tempering, and Annealing of Steel.— It has been already stated (§ 3) that the characteristic property of steel as distinguished from malleable iron is that when heated red hot and suddenly cooled (by plunging into cold water, oil, mercury, &c.) it becomes hardened to a greater or lesser extent, and rendered more or less brittle and also elastic; when the steel thus hardened is heated red hot and cooled slowly, on the other hand, it loses this acquired hardness and becomes soft and malleable again; this inverse process is strictly termed “softening” or “annealing.” The generic phrase “tempering” is usually applied to mean a combination of the hardening and annealing processes practically applied to all steel goods in order to give such a degree of hardness as will best fit them for resisting wear and tear, conjoined with the minimum possible of brittleness,—this being effected by first hardening them by heating to a red heat and suddenly cooling, and then heating up again to a somewhat lower temperature and allowing to cool slowly. According to the temperature to which the hardened steel has been heated before annealing, so is the diminution in the hardness effected by the process; and the particular resultant combination of hardness with toughness and elasticity is spoken of as the “temper” of the steel. Occasionally, however, this latter phrase is applied in somewhat different senses; thus steels of different carbon percentages are sometimes said to differ in temper irrespective of whether they have actually been hardened and annealed or not; the term “tempering capacity” or “hardening capacity” would better express the idea. Sometimes again, especially amongst “practical” men and workmen, the phrase “to temper a tool” is understood as signifying simply to harden it; whilst on the other
