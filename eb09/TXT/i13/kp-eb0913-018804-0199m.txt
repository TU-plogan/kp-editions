INTEREST. At English common law an agreement to pay interest is not implied unless in the case of negotiable instruments, when it is supported by mercantile usage. As a general rule therefore debts certain, payable at a specified time, do not carry interest from that time unless there has been an express agreement that they should do so. But when it has been the constant practice of a trade or business to charge interest, or where as between the parties interest has been always charged and paid, a contract to pay interest is implied. It is now provided by 3 & 4 Will. IV. c. 42 that, “upon all debts or sums certain payable at a certain time or otherwise, the jury on the trial of any issue or in any inquisition of damages may if they shall think fit allow interest to the creditor at a rate not exceeding the current rate of interest, from the time when such debts or sums certain were payable, if such debts or sums be payable by virtue of some written instrument at a certain time; or if payable otherwise, then from the time when demand of payment shall have been made in writing, so as such demand shall give notice to the debtor that interest will be claimed from the date of such demand until the term of payment: provided that interest shall be payable in all cases in which it is now payable by law.” Since the abolition of the usury laws by the 17 & 18 Vict. c. 90, a contract stipulating for higher interest than the legal rate of 5 per cent, is no longer illegal. This Act, however, does not affect contracts with pawnbrokers. Compound interest requires to be supported by positive proof that it was agreed to by the parties; an established practice to account in this manner will be evidence of such an agreement. In short, under the present law, any contract that the parties choose to make as to the amount of interest, or the time or manner of payment, will be enforced like any other agreement. When interest is awarded by a court it is generally at the rate of 4 per cent.; under special circumstances 5 per cent, has been allowed.
