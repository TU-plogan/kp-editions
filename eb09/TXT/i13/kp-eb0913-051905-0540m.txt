IVAN V., czar from 1682 to 1696, was the son of Alexis by his first wife Maria Miloslavskaia. He was infirm both in mind and body. The Narishkins, to which family the widow of Alexis (his second wife) belonged, were anxious that Peter, the next brother, should succeed, but Sophia, the ambitious daughter of Alexis by his first wife, wished Ivan to rule, so that she might govern in his name. She was ultimately forced, however, into the Devichi monastery, and Ivan reigned conjointly with his brother, the government being really in the hands of Peter assisted by his mother, the Narishkins, Dolgoroukis, and Boris Gol√Ætzin.
