ITIUS PORTUS, a place of no importance in itself, has a kind of factitious interest as the point whence Julius Caesar sailed from Gaul to Britain. Although Caesar does not mention the Portus in speaking of his first expedition [9:13:518] (55 b.c.), his language in describing it as the naval rendezvous before his second invasion (54 b.c.) leaves little doubt that he had sailed from it before. To determine, therefore, the site of the Portus Itius, while it would decide one of the most vexed questions of either ancient or modern geography, would go far to fix the spot where the great captain first set foot in England. It is impossible here to describe the controversy, or to detail the arguments which at one time or another have been advanced in favour of every bay between Calais and Boulogne. Modern criticism selects four sites as probable—Boulogne, Wissant, Ambleteuse, and the mouth of the Somme. The first two number most adherents; and in recent criticism Wissant, about 3∣ miles north-east of Cape Grisnez (Jtium Promontorium), has united a majority of voices.

The question turns upon the interpretation of certain passages in Caesar’s De Bcllο Gallico (iv. 20 sq. , v. 1 sq. ), with direct and indirect mentions in other Latin and Greek writers.
