IVRY-SUR-SEINE, a town and commune of France, in the arrondissement of Sceaux and the department of Seine, is situated near the left bank of the river Seine, 4 miles south-east of Paris. It has an interesting old church, but of the castle of the 17th century the fine gay-dens are the chief memorial. In the Petit Château died the duchess of Orleans, mother of Louis-Philippe. Ivry manufactures cordage, organs, glass, matches, manure, and chemicals. There are numerous handsome villas and fine gardens in the neighbourhood. The population in 1876 was 15,247.

Ivry-sur-Seine is of ancient foundation. In a charter of Louis IV. (D’Outremer), its name appears as Ivriacum, and in contemporary documents as Yvriacum. The fort of Ivry played an important part in the defence of Paris against the Germans in 1870-71, and in the Communist struggle of the latter year. Ivry-la-Bataille, in the department of Eure, where Henry IV. won his victory over the Leaguers in 1590, is not to be confounded with Ivry-sur-Seine.
