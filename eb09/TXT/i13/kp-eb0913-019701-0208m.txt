INTERPLEADER, in English law, is the form of action used when a person is sued at law for the recovery of money or goods wherein he has no interest, and which are also claimed of him by some third party. Originally the only relief available to the possessor against such adverse claims was by means of a bill of interpleader in equity. The Interpleader Act, 1 & 2 Will IV. c. 58, enabled the defendant in such cases, on application to the court, to have the original action stayed and converted into a trial between the two claimants. The Common Law Procedure Act of 1860 further extended the power of the common law courts in interpleader; and the Judicature Act, 1875, enacts that the practice and procedure under these two statutes shall apply to all divisions of the high court of justice. The Judicature Act also extends the remedy of interpleader to a debtor or other person liable in respect of a debt alleged to be assigned, when the assignment is disputed. Interpleader is the equivalent of multiplepoinding in Scotch law.
