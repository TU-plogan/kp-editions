IRELAND, Samuel, the dupe of his son, the subject of the following article, in the publication of the supposed Shakespearian papers, was born in London, where he was originally a mechanic in Spitalfields. He afterwards became a dealer in old books and prints and similar articles; and, turning his knowledge of drawing and engraving to account, he published several books of travel, with illustrations in aquatinta. On December 24, 1796, Ireland published the Miscellaneous Papers and Legal Instruments under the Hand and Seal of William Shakspeare; including the Tragedy of King Lear and a small fragment of Hamlet, dated. 1797, and purporting to be copies of originals furnished him by his son. Although, on the exposure of the fraud, the latter asserted his father’s complete innocence, Samuel Ireland felt the disgrace very bitterly, and the occurrence is said to have hastened his death, which took place in July 1800.

His works, which at one time were in considerable request, include A Picturesque Τοur through Ηollαηcl, Brabant, and part of France, 2 vols., 1790; Picturesque Views on the River Thame,s, 2 vols., 1792, on the River Medway, 1793, on the Warwickshire Avon, 1795, on the River Wye, 1797, and on the River Severn, 1824; Graphic Illustrations of Hogarth, 2 vols., 1794; and A Picturesque View, with an Historical Account of the Inns of Court, 1800. On the forgeries question he published A Vindication of his Conduct, 1797, and An Investigation of Mr Malone's Claim to the character of a Scholar or Critic, 1797.
