ISLÁMÁBÁD, a town in Kashmir state, Punjab, lies in 33° 43' N. lat., 75° 17' E. long., on the north bank of the Jhelum (Jhilam), there about 80 yards wide, and crossed by a wooden bridge. The town crowns the summit of a long low ridge, extending from the mountains eastward. Below is a reservoir containing a spring’of clear water called the Anat Nâg, slightly sulphurous, from which volumes of gas continually arise. The water swarms with sacred fish. There are large manufactures of Kashmir shawls, also of chintzes, cotton, and woollen goods.
