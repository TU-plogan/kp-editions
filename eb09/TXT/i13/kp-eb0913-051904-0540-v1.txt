IVAN IV., surnamed the Terrible (ffroznι), the first czar of Russia, was a mere child at the time of the death of his father Vasili in 1533. His reign may be divided into three periods:—(1) his minority, under the regency of his stepmother Helen Glinska; (2) from his attaining his majority till the death of his amiable wife Anastasia Romanova, during which time he was a bold and vigorous ruler, and careful of the happiness of his subjects; and (3) from her death till the conclusion of his reign in 1584, the period signalized by those atrocities which have earned for Ivan such an unenviable reputation. He was the first Russian sovereign who took the title of Czar, a Slavonic form of Caesar. In 1552 he annexed Kazan, and Astrakhan two years later. In many points of his character Ivan resembles Louis XI., especially in his statecraft and superstition; indeed, just as France owed her aggrandizement to some of her most cruel sovereigns, so in Russia the greatest tyrants have been the consolidators of the empire. In the time of Ivan a printing press was set up at Moscow, and the first book published (in 1564) was an Apostol— a name given to a collection of the Acts of the Apostles and the apostolic epistles; but persecution was soon directed against the printers, who, from the jealousy of those who gained their livelihood by copying religious books, were compelled to fly from Russia, and were protected by Sigismund II. of Poland. They afterwards printed the whole Bible at Ostrog in Volhynia in 1581. In the British Museum is a copy of this book, which formerly belonged to the terrible Ivan. Sir Jerome Horsey, the English ambassador, has written on the fly-leaf, “this Bibell in the Slavonian tonge had owt of the emperor’s librari.” Siberia was also annexed in this reign through the enterprise of the Cossack Yermak, and the English first opened up commercial intercourse with the country by means of the expedition of Sir Hugh Willoughby and Richard Chancellor in 1553. The English for a long time enjoyed the monopoly of the Russian trade, and it is to some of them that the Russians are indebted for interesting accounts of their land, especially to Dr Giles Fletcher, uncle of the dramatist, whose Russe Common-Wealth (London, 1591) is a mine of valuable information. The atrocities committed by Ivan at Novgorod in 1569, and at Pskov soon afterwards, are well known. It is from foreigners, such as Horsey, that we get minute accounts of his many cruelties. In the British Museum are preserved some of his letters to Queen Elizabeth, of whom he requested that an English wife should be chosen for him and sent to Russia. A Lady Mary Hastings, daughter of the earl of Huntingdon, was selected and introduced to the Russian ambassador Pisemski, but when the time drew near for her departure she entreated her father with tears not to send her to such a husband. The miserable tyrant expired in 1584, from grief for his son, whom he had killed in a fit of passion three years before. Like Louis XI., he loved to surround himself with quacks and magicians, some of whom, according to' Horsey, prophesied the day of his death. The latter has left us the following curious notice of him:—

“Thus much to conclude with this emperor Ivan Vasiliwich. He was a goodlie man of person and presence, well favoured, high forehead, shrill voice, a right Sithian, full of readie wisdom, cruell, bloudye, merciless; his own experience mannaged by direction both his state and commonwealth affares; was sumptuously intomed in Michell Archangel church, where he, though garded daye and night, remaines a fearfull spectacle to the memory of such as pass by or heer his name spoken of, [who] are contented to cross and bless themselves from his resurrection againe.”
