ISIDORES HISPALENSIS, or Isidore of Seville, one of the most influential writers of the early portion of the Middle Ages, flourished during the latter part of the 6th and the early part of the 7th century. The exact date of his birth is unknown; he died 636 a.d. Of the particulars of his life, specially of the earlier portion, little is known with certainty. He was the son of a wealthy and distinguished native of Cartagena, named Severianus, and his elder brother, Leander, was bishop of Seville. Isidore succeeded his brother in his bishopric at the beginning of the 7th century, and acquired high renown in the church, not only by his conduct of his see, but by his numerous theological, historical, and scientific works. His learning and eloquence are celebrated by his contemporaries, and his reputation was even greater in the succeeding ages. During the latter portion of the period which historians are accustomed to call the Dark Ages, extending from the 7th to the 10th century, the writings of Isidore furnished mental pabulum to all students and scholars; and, though one can find in them little of real value and no originality, they have at least the merit of having served to keep alive, even in a form far from adequate, some remnants of the older culture and learning. The most elaborate of his writings, that entitled Etymologiarum Libri XX., or sometimes Origines, is an encyclopaedic work, eclectic in character, and presenting in dry compendious form the sum of the knowledge of the age on all branches of scientific research. Later writers make continual references to the Etymologies, which served for long as the general text-book. The arrangement of materials in the twenty books is unsystematic, and on most matters of scientific experience it is evident that the writer depends on secondhand information. Perhaps the most interesting of the books are the fifth, containing a sketch of universal history, and the ninth, on language. Various smaller writings of .Isidore, such as the two works Differentiarum, the two books on synonyms, and the short tractate De Natura Rerum, are supplementary to the Etymologies, and carry out in detail what is there given in epitome. The tract De Natura Rerum is specially interesting as containing the sum of physical philosophy during this period of the Middle Ages. Of Isidore’s many writings on theological subjects no detailed account can be given.

The works of Isidoro have been published with preface by F. Arevalo,— S. Isidοri Hispalensis cpisc. Opera omnia, 7 vols. 4to, Rome, 1797-1803 (2 vols, of Prolegomena). The Be Natura Rerum has been edited separately by G. Becker, Berlin, 1857. See [9:13:387] Ebert, Geschichte d. Litteratur d. Mittelalters im Abendlande, i. 555 sq.
