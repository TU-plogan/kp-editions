IRBIT, a town of European Russia in the government of Perm, 70 miles north-east of Ekaterinburg, at the confluence of the Irbit with the Nitza, a sub-tributary of the Obi. Though the St Petersburg Calendar for 1878 gives the permanent population as only 4212 (in 1860 the number was 3408), it is one of the most important trade centres of northern Russia, and during its great fair (February 1-13 to March 1-13) it is visited by upwards of 20,000 people. Among its public buil lings are a theatre, an exchange, a bank (established in 1849, with a capital of 30,000 roubles), and a district school. Irbit was originally founded by Tartars in 1633, but the discovery of iron ore in the neighbourhood soon attracted Russian settlers. The assistance which the inhabitants rendered in the suppression of the Pugatcheff rebellion was rewarded by Catherine granting Irbit the rank of a town in 1775. In 1781 it was made a district town of Perm. The right of holding the fair was bestowed by Michael Theodorovitch as early as 1643, and from 1695 the customs which had previously been collected at Verkhoturya were taken at Irbit itself.

. In 1829 the value of the wares brought to market amounted to 10,888,155 roubles (£1,723,916), and these were sold to the value of 7,537,489. In 1861 the corresponding figures were 51,204,000 roubles and 39,397,500. In 1859 the principal items were (a) of Russian goods: leather and skins, 6,780,000 roubles; furs, 4,750,000; copper andiron, 1,252,000; grain, salt, meat, and fish, 1,207,000; fruit and groceries, 1,115,000; wooden wares, 1,040,000; (b) of European wares: cotton, woollen, and silk, 12,087,000; sugar, 2,650,000; groceries 860,000; (c) of Asiatic goods: tea, 29,500,000. In 1880 the fur trade was especially active, no fewer than 3,550,000 Siberian furs and 110,100 Russian furs being brought to market. The tea, on the other hand, did not go beyond the value of 5⅛ million roubles. There is a horse fair at Irbit, October 28th (September 10th), when old horses are disposed of by Tobolsk and Tyumen Tartars. The Irbit iron-works are situated 40 miles from the town, on the banks of the river Irbit, below the confluence of the Shaitanka, which flows out of Irbit lake, a sheet of water nearly 4 miles long and 2⅜ miles broad. The inhabitants of the spot numbered 1822 in 1869 (861 men and 961 women). In 1873 the output of pig iron was about 2000 tons. The Irbit post-road leaves the great Siberian road at Kamnishloff, 73 miles from the town.
