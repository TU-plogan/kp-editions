IRIS, the rainbow, was personified as one of the secondary deities of Olympus, and occurs very frequently both in art and in literature. As the rainbow unites earth and heaven, Iris is the messenger of the gods to men; in this capacity she is mentioned frequently in the Iliad, but never in the Odyssey, where Hermes takes her place. According to Hesiod (Theog. 260) she is the daughter of Thaumas and Electra and sister of the Harpies, the stormwinds. With the swiftness of the wind (d∈λλoτroς, 7roδτ)ι∕ςuos) she penetrates everywhere, bearing the messages of heaven. She often carries the caduceus, the herald’s staff of Hermes. An epithet frequently applied to her is “golden-winged” (χρυσόφτερος), and in painting and sculpture she is always represented with wings. In the absence of other criteria, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish her from Nike. The latter is more frequently attendant on Athene, while Iris offener accompanies Hera.
