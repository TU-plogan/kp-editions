GIUNTA PISANO, the earliest Italian painter whose name is found inscribed on an extant work, exercised his art from 1202 to 1236; he may perhaps have been born towards 1180 in Pisa, and died in or soon after 1236. There is some ground for thinking that his family-name was Capiteno. In recent times some efforts have been made to uphold his deservings as an artist, thereby detracting so far from the credit due to the initiative of Cimabue; but it cannot be said that these efforts rest on a very solid basis. To most eyes the performances of Giunta merely represent a continuing stage of the long period of pictorial inaptitude. The inscribed work above referred to, one of his earliest, is a Crucifix now or lately in the kitchen of the convent of St Anne in Pisa. Other Pisan works of like date are very barbarous, and some of them may be also from the hand of Giunta. It is said that he painted in the upper church of Assisi,â€”in especial a Crucifixion dated 1236, with a figure of Father Elias, the general of the Franciscans, embracing the foot of the cross. In the sacristy is a portrait of St Francis, also ascribed to Giunta; but it more probably belongs to the close of the 13th century. This artist was in the practice of painting upon cloth stretched on wood, and prepared with plaster.
