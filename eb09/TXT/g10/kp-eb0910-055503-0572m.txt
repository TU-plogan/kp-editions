GETA, Publius Septimus Antoninus (189-212), younger son of the Roman emperor Severus, was born at Milan, 189 a.d. Between him and his brother Caracalla there existed from their early years a keen rivalry and antipathy. On the death of their father in 211 they were, [9:10:556] in accordance with his instructions, proclaimed joint emperors; and after the failure of a proposed treaty by which Caracalla was to retain Europe and western Africa, and Geta Asia and Egypt, Caracalla, on the pretence of a desire for reconciliation, arranged a meeting with his brother in his motherâ€™s apartments, and by means of assassins murdered him in her presence (212). His name was obliterated from all public inscriptions; all coins bearing his effigy were to be destroyed; and the use of his name, either in conversation or in writing, was forbidden under pain of death.
