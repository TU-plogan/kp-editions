GOSLICKI, Wawrzyniec (1533-1607), a learned Pole, better known under his Latinized name of Laurentius Grimalius Goslicius, was born about 1533. After having studied first at Cracow and afterwards at Padua, he entered the church, and was successively appointed bishop of Kaminietz and of Posen. Goslicki, although an ecclesiastic, was an active man of business, was held in high estimation by his contemporaries, and was frequently engaged in political affairs. It was chiefly through his influence, and through the letter he wrote to the pope against the Jesuits, that they were prevented from establishing their schools at Cracow. He was also a strenuous advocate of religious toleration in Poland. He died October 31, 1607.

His principal work is De optimo senatore, &c. (Venice, 1568). There are two English translations published respectively under the titles A commonwealth of good counsaile, &c. (1607), and The Accomplished Senator, done into English by Mr Oldisworth (1733).
