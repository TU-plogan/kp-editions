GALEN, Christoph Bernhard van (1600-1678), prince-bishop of Miinster, was descended from a noble family in Westphalia, and was born 15th October 1600. After attending the Jesuit college at Münster, and the universities of Cologne, Mainz, Louvain, and Bordeaux, he was engaged in several diplomatic missions. Subsequently he became colonel in the army of the elector Ferdinand of Bavaria, and took part in campaigns against the French and Swiss. On the death of Ferdinand he was chosen princebishop of Münster, but scarcely had he succeeded in restoring the internal prosperity of his territories, and freeing them from foreign invaders, when an insurrection arose in the city whichhe was unable completely to subdue till 1661. Iu 1664 he was chosen, along with the margrave Frederick of Baden, joint administrator of military affairs of the Rhenish alliance in its war against the Turks. After the peace that followed the victory of St Gotthard, he concluded an alliance with Charles II. of England against the Netherlands; but through the intervention of Louis XIV. an arrangement was'made in 1666 by which the king of the Netherlands vacated all the territories of Galen, with the exception of the town of Borkelo. In 1672, in conjunction with France, Galen renewed hostilities against the Netherlands, but in the same year suffered a severe defeat at Coevorden, and although, along with the French general Turenne, he afterwards obtained several successes, he concluded a peace in 1674, by whichhe resigned all the advantages he had gained. In the following year he entered into an alliance with the king of Denmark and the elector of Brandenburg against Charles XI. of Sweden, and in 1676 captured Stade, the capital of the duchy of Bremen, after which he took possession of that duchy and of several places in the duchy of Verden. Subsequently he became involved in a war with East Friesland, and only consented to evacuate that territory on payment of a large sum of money. He died at Abaus, 19th September 1678.
