GLOUCESTER, a city and port of entry of Essex county, Massachusetts, United States, is beautifully situated near the southern extremity of the peninsula of Cape Ann, 30 miles N.N.E. of Boston by rail. It includes six villages—Gloucester village, East Gloucester, West Gloucester, Annisquam, Bay View, and Lanesville. The harbour, opening out into Massachusetts bay, is one of the best on the coast, and is defended by a fort. The prosperity of Gloucester· depends mainly on its cod and mackerel fisheries, which employ nearly 400 vessels, with upwards of 3500 men, and have an annual value of about 4,000,000 dollars. For the year ending June 30, 1878, the total value of imparts[9:10:692] was 81,450 dollars, of domestic exports 36,172 dollars, and of foreign exports 384 dollars. Steamers ply daily between the city and Boston. There are a number of manufactories connected chiefly with the fisheries, and in the neighbourhood there are extensive granite quarries. Gloucester possesses a fine city hall, a high school, seven grammar schools, and a free library. On account of its attractive situation, and the fine scenery of the neighbourhood, it is a favourite summer residence. About 2 miles from it is Norman’s Woe, the scene of the wreck of the “Hesperus,” celebrated in Longfellow’s poem.

Gloucester received its name from the fact that many of its early settlers came from the county of Gloucester in England. It was occupied as a fishing station in 1624, was incorporated as a town in 1642, and was made a city in 1874. It was attacked by the English in 1775 and in 1814, in both cases unsuccessfully. The population in 1800 was 5313; in 1850,7786; in 1860, 10,904; and in 1870, 15,389, of whom 4007 were foreigners.
