GAINSBOROUGH, a market-town and port of Lincolnshire, is situated on the right bank of the Trent, 21 miles above its junction with the estuary of the Humber, and 16 miles N.W. of Lincoln. It consists chiefly of one long well-paved street running parallel to the river, which is here crossed by a fine stone bridge of three arches. The parish church, a fine building in the Grecian style, was rebuilt in 1748, with the exception of the old tower, which belongs to the 12th century. Holy Trinity church, built in 1843, has annexed to it an ecclesiastical district taken out of the old parish of Gainsborough. The old hall, supposed to have been partly built by John of Gaunt, is a curious oaktimber framed building, forming three sides of a quadrangle, and having a tower 78 feet high. It has been restored, and part of it converted into a corn exchange and assembly rcoms. Gainsborough possesses a grammar school (founded in 1589 by a charter of Queen Elizabeth) and other schools, a town-hall, a county court-house, a literary institute, a temperance hall, a savings-bank, and a provident dispensary. Ship building is carried on, and there are manufactories of linseed cake, ropes, malt, and tobacco, with breweries and iron and brass foundries. Vessels of 200 tons burden can come up to the town. The population in 1871 was 7564, and since that date has been rapidly increasing.
