GALANGAL, formerly written “galingale,” and sometimes “garingal,” rhizoma galangae (Arabian, Kholinjan; ^[1. Apparently derived from the Chinese Kau-liang·Kiang, i.e., Kau-liang ginger, the term applied by the Chinese to galangal, after the prefecture Kau-chau fu in Canton province, formerly called Kau-liang (see F. Porter Smith. Contrib, to the Materia Medica . . . oj China, p. 9, 1871). ] x German, Calgantwurzel ; F ren ch, Racine de Galanga), is an aromatic stimulant drug. Lesser galangal root, radix galangoe minoris, the ordinary galangal of commerce, is the dried rhizome of Alpiηiα officinarum, Hance, a plant of the natural order Zingiberaceoe, growing in the Chinese island of Hainan, where it is cultivated, and probably also in the woods of the southern provinces of China. The plant is regarded by Dr Hance as closely allied to, but as perfectly distinct from, the Alpinia calcarata of Roscoe, the rhizome of which is sold in the bazaars of some parts of India as a sort of galangal. Its stems attain a length of about 4 feet, and its leaves are slender, lanceolate, and light green, and have a hot taste; the flowers are ebracteate, white with red veins, and in simple racemes; the roots form dense masses, sometimes more than a foot in diameter; and the rhizomes grow horizontally, and are f inch or less in thickness. The drug occurs in short, cylindrical, or somewhat tuberous, often forked pieces, which have a fibrous structure, and externally are reddish-brown and marked with fine longitudinal striations, and with transverse rings showing the points of attachment of scales or leaves, and internally are of a light-brown, becoming darker at the centre. It has a warm, aromatic taste, resembling that of mingled ginger and pepper. On analysis it yields, among other constituents, much starch, an essential oil of the composition C 10 H 16 ,H 2 O (Vogel), and a crystalline body, kαmpferid (Brandes). Greater or Java galangal, radix galangae majoris (French, Galaηga de l , Inde), the rhizome of Alpinia Galanga, Willd., is a drug rarely now imported into Europe. It is mentioned by Marco Polo (ed. Yule, ii. p. 217) and Garcias da Horta as a product of Java, and the latter distinguishes it from the Chinese or lesser galangal, from which it is known by its larger size, orange-brown exterior, and feebler and less aromatic odour. The seedcapsules of Alpinia Galanga are believed to be what are termed “galanga cardamoms,” which have the properties of cardamoms and ginger combined, and in China are used for various medicinal purposes. (See Hanbury, Science Papers, pp. 107-9, and 252, 253, 1876; and F. P. Smith, op. cit.) Galangal seems to have been unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans, and to have been first introduced into Europe by Arabian physicians. It is mentioned in the writings of Ibn Khurdâdbah, an Arabian geographer who flourished in the latter half of the 9th century, and “gallengar” (galingale or galangal) is one of the ingredients in an Anglo-Saxon receipt for a “wen salve” (see O. Cockayne, Saxon Leechdoms, vol. iii. p. 13). In the Middle Ages, as at present in Livonia, Esthonia, and central Russia, galangal was in esteem in Europe both as a medicine and a spice, and in China it is still employed as a therapeutic agent. Its chief consumption is in Russia, where it is used as a cattle-medicine, and as a flavouring for liqueurs. By the Tartars it is taken with tea (see Hanbury, op. cit., p. 374). The exports of galangal from Shanghai, in China, amounted in 1869 to 370,000 fi>, value £3046, 16s. 9d. Chinese or lesser galangal was in past times commonly known as “Cyperus Babylonicus,” from its resemblance to the tubers of plants of the genus Cyperus, which apparently served as a substitute for it^[2. Alexander Neckam, an English author (1157-1217), says of “cyperus,” in his poem De Laeudibus Divinoe Sapientioe (see Wright’s edition of his works, p. 478, London, 1863) — “Hydropicus laudat cyperum, vulnus, stomachusque, Humor siccandus, calculus, atque lien.” ] (c∕. Fuchs, Op. Didactica, pars ii. p. 28, 1604, fol.; and Avicenna, ed. Plempii, lib. ii. p. 297, 1658, fol.). Gerarde {The Herball, p. 28, 1597) terms the species Cyperus longus “English galingale.” - -
