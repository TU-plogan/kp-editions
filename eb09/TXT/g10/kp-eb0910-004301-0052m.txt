GALLIUM, so called in honour of France (Gallia), symbol Ga, atomic weight 69 ’ 9, a metal discovered, August 27, 1875, byM. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, in the spectroscopic examination of zinc-blende from Pierrefitte in the valley of Argeles, Hautes Pyrénées, and since found to exist in blende from several other localities, notably in that of the mines of ttidrich and Apfel at Bensberg, on the Rhine, which contains nearly 16 milligrammes per kilogramme. Its density and approximate atomic weight·, and other of its characters, were predicted by Mendeljeff, in accordance with his law that the properties of the elementary bodies, as also the constitution and properties of their combinations, are periodic functions of their atomic weights (see article Chemistry, vol. v. p. 543, col. 2). Gallium may be prepared by a process the chief features of which are the treatment of the ore, which contains the metal in only very minute quantity, with zinc; the removal, from a hydrochloric acid solution of the gelatinous precipitate thereby produced, of various foreign metals by means of hydrogen sulphide; the fractionation of the residual liquid with sodium carbonate, gallium being thrown down before zinc by that reagent; the formation of a sulphate from the resultant precipitate; and, lastly, the electrolysis of a potash solution of the purified oxide obtained therefrom, the metal appearing on the negative platinum electrode. Solid gallium is greyish-white, of octahedral crystallization, and remarkably hard and resistant even at a temperature little below its melting point, and is but slightly malleable and flexible, though thin plates of it will bear bending several times without breaking. It melts when held in the fingers, its point of fusion being 30' ’ 15 C. (86 o, 27 Fahr.). The liquid metal is of a silvery white colour, and adheres to glass, forming a mirror resembling that of mercury. It exhibits in a remarkable degree the phenomenon of superfusion, but when some degrees below its melting point crystallizes immediately if a small fragment of the solid metal attached to a platinum wire be inserted into it. At 24 o, 5 C. (76 0, 1 Fahr.) the specific gravity of the solid metal is 5 ’ 956, and of the liquid 6Ό69; the specific heat of the former between 12 c and 23° C. is 0Ό79, giving atomic heat 5∙52, and that of the latter between 119° and 106° C. is 0Ό802 (Berthelot, Compt. Pend., lxxxvi. 786-7). At a red heat in air gallium is not perceptibly volatilized. It is little affected by cold nitric acid, but dissolves readily in hydrochloric acid; with potash solution it liberates hydrogen. It furnishes a deliquescent and very soluble chloride, GaCl 3 or Ga 2 Cl 6 , a corresponding bromide and iodide, and an ammonio-gallic alum. Its oxide is more soluble in ammonia than is alumina. In basicity it holds a place intermediate between aluminium and indium. It is precipitated by alkaline carbonates and barium carbonate, but not by hydrogen sulphide and ammonium sulphide in the absence of zinc. Gallium affords two brilliant lines in the violet part of the spectrum.
