GLOSSOP, a municipal borough of Derbyshire, is situated on the extreme northern border of the county, 14 miles E.S.E. of Manchester. It is the chief seat of the cotton manufacture in Derbyshire, and it has also woollen and paper mills, dye and print works, and bleaching greens. The town has for several years been rapidly increasing in size, and now consists of three main divisions, viz., the Old Town (or Glossop proper), Ho∖vard Town (or Glossop Dale), and Mill Town. The principal buildings are the town hall and market-house, the temperance hall, the grammar school, and the mechanics’ institution. In the immediate neighbourhood is Glossop Hall, the seat of Baron Howard, lord of the manor, a picturesque old building with extensive terraced gardens. On a hill near the town is Milandra Castle, the site of a Roman station.

Glossop was granted by Henry I. to William Peverel, on the attainder of whose son it reverted to the crown. In 1157 it was gifted by Henry II. to the abbey of Basingwerk. Henry VIII. bestoλve<1 it on the earl of Shrewsbury, and it now belongs to the Howards. It was made a municipal borough in 1866. The population in 1871 was 17,046.
