GFRÖRER, August Friedrich (1803-1861), historian, was born at Calw, Wiirtemberg, on the 5th of March 1803, and at the close of his preliminary studies at the seminary of Blaubeuren, entered the university of Tübingen in 1821 as a student of evangelical theology. After passing his final examinations in 1825, he spent a year in Switzerland, during part of which time he acted as companion and secretary to Bonstetten; the year 1827 was spent chiefly in Rome. Returning to Wurtemberg in 1828, he first under took the duties of repetent or theological tutor in Tübingen and afterwards accepted a curacy in Stuttgart; but having in 1830 received an appointment in the royal public library at Stuttgart, he thenceforth gave himself exclusively to literature and historical science. His first work on Philo {Philo u. die jüdisch-alexandrinische Theosophie, 1831) was rapidly followed by an elaborate biography, in two volumes, of Gustavus Adolphus {Gustav Adolf, König von Schweden, 1835-37), and by a critical history of primitive Christianity {Kritische Geschichte des Urchristenthums, 1838), in three volumes, consisting of three parts, entitled respectively “The Century of Salvation” {Jahrhundert des Heils), “Sacred Legend” {Die heilige Sage), and “Truth” {Die Wahrheit). In both of the last-named works, Gfrörer had manifested opinions unfavourable to Protestantism, which, however, were not openly avowed until fully developed in his church history {Allgemeine Kirchengeschichte bis Beginn des 14te⅛ Jahrhunderts, 1841-46). In the autumn of 1846 he was appointed to the chair of history in the university of Freiburg, where he continued to teach until his death, which took place at Carlsbad on the 10th of July 1861. In 1848 he sat as a representative in the Frankfort parliament, where he supported the “High German” party, and in 1853 he publicly went over to the Church of Rome, influenced, however, in this, it is said, more by regard for what he conceived to be its political value, than by any purely religious consideration. Among his later works the most important is the Geschichte der ost- u. westfränJeischen [9:10:559] Karolinger (1858); but those on the pseudo-Isidoτian Decretals {Untersuchung über Alter, Ursprung, u. Werth der Decretalen des falschen ∕sidorus, 1848), on the primitive history of mankind {Urgeschichte des menschlichen Geschlechts, 1855), on Hildebrand {Papst Gregor VII. u. sein Zeitalter, 1859-61), on the history of the 18th century {Geschichte des l⅛ten Jahrhunderts, 1862-73), on German popular rights {Zur Geschichte deutscher Volhsrechte, 1866), and on Byzantine history {Byzantinische Geschichte, 1872-74), are also works of real value. The fruit of much original research, they convey a great quantity of fresh information, and are unusually rich in suggestion; their chief fault may be said to lie in an excess of ingenuity, which leads their author to imagine combinations which never existed, and to invent the most recondite causes for historical occurrences, the explanation of which is rather to be sought in the region of the obvious.
