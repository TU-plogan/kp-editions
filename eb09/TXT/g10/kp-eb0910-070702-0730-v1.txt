GOÄLPÄRA, the most westerly district of Assam, between 25° 21' and 26° 51' N. lat. and between 89° 44' and 91°0' E. long., bounded on the N. by Bhutiln, E. byKâmnip, S. by the Gâro Hills, and W. by Kuch Belmr and Rangpur. The district is situated on the Brahmaputra, at the corner where the river takes its southerly course into Bengal. The scenery is striking. Along the banks of the river grow clumps of cane and reed; farther back stretch fields of rice cultivation, broken only by the fruit trees surrounding the villages, and in the background rise the forest-clad hills overtopped by the white peaks of the Himalayas. The soil of the hills is of a red ochreous earth, with blocks of granite and sandstone interspersed; that of the plains is of alluvial formation. Earthquakes are common and occasionally severe shocks have been experienced. The Brahmaputra annually inundates vast tracts of country. Numerous extensive forests yield valuable timber. Wild animals of all kinds are found.

Goalpara has always formed the frontier between Bengal and Assam; originally it must have constituted part of the legendary Hindu kingdom of Karnrιip; from that it must have fallen into the hands of the early rajas of Kuch Behar, who, however, were unable long to retain their kingdom. From the east the wild Ahams came down the valley of the Brahmaputra, while from the west the Mughuls extended the limits of the Delhi empire. In 1603 the Mughuls came into collision with the Ahams, but were forced to retreat with a decisive defeat. The district came into British possession with the rest of Bengal in 1765. It has undergone several changes in administration, and in 1872, when Assam was constituted a separate administration, Goalpara was included within it.

In 1872 the population was 407,714,—311,419 being Hindus, and 89,916 Mahometans. Goal para town, with between 3000 and 4000 inhabitants, is the most populous place, as well as the chief centre of trade. Dhubri is the point where the traffic of northern Bengal is shipped on board the Assam steamers. Gauripur and Lakhshmipur carry on a thriving trade in timber.

Rice forms the staple crop of the district. Mustard and jute are also largely grown. The area under cultivation is estimated at 600,000 acres, or about one-third of the total area. The district is not liable to any form of natural calamity; occasionally blights have been caused by worms and insects, but the harvests have never been affected. The manufactures consist of the making of brass and iron utensils and of gold and silver ornaments, weaving of silk cloth, basket-work, and pottery. The cultivation of tea has recently been introduced, and is advancing considerably. The chief centres of traffic are Goâlpara town, Dhubri, Jogigopha, Bijni, Gauripur, and Singiwâri. Local trade is in the hands of Mârwari merchants, and is carried on at the bdzeirs, weekly hats or markets, and periodical fairs. The chief exports are mustard-seed, jute, cotton, timber, lac, silk cloth, india-rubber, and tea; the imports, Bengal rice, European piece goods, salt, hardware, oil, and tobacco. The Brahmaputra and its tributaries are the chief means of communication, and are navigated by liver steamers and the largest native boats. Goalpara is considered an unhealthy district both for Europeans and for natives. The principal diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, diarrhoea, dysentery, rheumatism, and chest complaints. Cholera frequently occurs in an epidemic form, and small-pox is more or less prevalent every year. The mean annual temperature is 75° Fahr.; and the average annual rainfall is 98’75 inches.

Goàlpâra, the chief town of above district, situated on the left bank of the Brahmaputra, in 26° 1Γ 0" N. lat., 90° 41' 0' E. long. It was the frontier outpost of the Mahometan power in the direction of Assam, and has long been a flourishing seat of river trade. The civil station is built on the summit of a small hill commanding a magnificent view of the valley of the Brahmaputra, bounded on the north by the snowy ranges of the Himdlayas and on the south by the Gâro hills. The native town is built on the western slope of the hill, and the lower portion is subject to inundation from the marshy land which extends in every direction. Population (1872) 4678.
