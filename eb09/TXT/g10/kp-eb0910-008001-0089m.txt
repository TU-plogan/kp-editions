GARESSIO, Garesso, or Garezzo, in Latin Garexium, a town of Italy about 18 miles S.E. of Mondovi, in the valley of the Tararo. The Roman remains which are discovered from time to time bear witness to its high antiquity; during the Middle Ages it was the seat of a marquisate, which in 1509 was sold to the Spinola family, and its double walls gave it some importance as a defensible position. Besides a castle, it possesses three old monastic buildings, one of which, the Carthusian convent of Casotto, is an edifice of much magnificence. Population in 1870 nearly 7000.
