GIRONDE, a maritime department in the S.W. of France, formed from four divisions of the old province of Guyenne, viz., Bordelais, Bazadais, and parts of Périgord and Agénois. It is bounded on the N. by the department of Charente-Inférieure, E. by those of Dordogne and Lot-et-Garonne, S. by that of Landes, and W. by the Bay of Biscay. It lies between 44° 12' and 45° 35' N. lat. and between 0° 18' E. and 1° 16' W. long., being 106 miles in length from N.W. to S.E., and 80 in breadth from N.E. to S.W. It takes its name from the river or estuary of the Gironde formed by the union of the Garonne and Dordogne. The department divides itself naturally into a western and an eastern portion. The former, which is termed Les Landes, occupies more than a third of the department, and consists chiefly of morasses, or of sandy and unfruitful downs. The downs stretching along the sea-coast have, however, been now planted with pines, which, binding the sand together by means of their roots, afford an efficacious protection against the encroachments of the sea. Near the coast are two extensive lakes, Carcans and Lacanau, communicating with each other, and with the bay of Arcachon, near the southern extremity of the department. The Bay of Arcachon contains numerous islands, and on the land side forms a vast shallow lagoon, a considerable portion of which, however, has been drained and converted into arable land. The eastern portion of the department consiste chiefly of a succession of hill and dale, and, especially in the valley of the Gironde, is very fertile. The estuary of the Gironde is about 45 miles in length, and varies in breadth from 2 to 6 miles. The principal affluent of the Dordogne in this department is the Isle. The feeders of the Garonne are, with the exception of the Dropt, all small. West of the Garonne the only river of importance is the Leyre, which flows into the bay of Arcachon. The climate is humid and temperate. Wheat, rye, maize, millet, and hemp are grown to a considerable extent. The corn produced, however, does not more than half meet the wants of the inhabitants. The culture of the vine is by far the most important branch of industry carried on, the vineyards occupying about one-seventh of the surface of the department. The wine-growing districts are the Médoc, Graves, Côtes, Palus, and Entre-deux-Mers. The Médoc country grows the three grands crus. The Graves country forms a zone 30 miles in extent, and is situated in the vicinity of the Garonne and Dordogne, extending from Châtillon-sur-Gironde to Langon. This is the Sauterne country. The wines of the Côtes district are St Émilion, Pommerol, St Laurent, St Hippolyte, St Christophe, and St George. The Palus and Entre-deux-Mers produce is inferior. Fruits and vegetables are increasingly cultivated, strawberries, cherries, apricots, prunes, artichokes, and peas being largely exported. Tobacco is also cultivated to a considerable extent. Large supplies of resin, pitch, and turpentine are obtained from the pine wood. There are stone quarries and smelting works, but few mines. The manufactures are various, and, with the general trade, are chiefly carried on at Bordeaux. Gironde is divided into the arrondissements of Bordeaux, Blaye, Lesparre, Liboume, Bazas, and La Réole, with 48 cantons, and 547 communes. The chief town is Bordeaux. The total area is 3761 square miles; and the population in 1866 was 701,855, and in 1876 735,242. For a graphic description of the scenery of Les Landes in Gironde see the novel Maître Pierre of Edmund About.
