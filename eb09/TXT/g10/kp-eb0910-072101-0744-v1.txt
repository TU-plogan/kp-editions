GOES, Hugo van der ( ? -1482), a painter of considerable celebrity at Ghent, was known to Vasari, as he is known to us, by a single picture in a Florentine monastery. At a period when the family of the Medici had not yet risen from the rank of a great mercantile firm to that of a reigning dynasty, it employed as an agent at the port of Bruges Tommaso Portinari, a lineal descendant, it was said, of Folco, the father of Dante’s Beatrix. Tommaso, at that time patron of a chapel in the hospital of Santa Maria Nuova at Florence, ordered an altar-piece of Hugo van der Goes, and commanded him to illustrate the sacred theme of “ Quem genuit adoravitf' In the centre of a vast triptych, comprising numerous figures of life size, Hugo represented the Virgin kneeling in adoration before the new-born Christ attended by Shepherds and Angels. On the wings he portrayed Tommaso and his two sons in prayer under the protection of Saint Anthony and St Matthew, and Tommaso’s wife and two daughters supported by St Margaret and St Mary Magdalen. The triptych was sent to Florence, and placed on the altar upon which it still remains. Van der Goes, like Hubert Van Eyck and Jodocus of Ghent, has bequeathed but this one picture to posterity; but it is a picture which shows that he was an artist of whom Ghent might be proud, as Bruges was proud of John Van Eyck and Brussels of Roger van der Weyden. Unhappily the triptych of Santa Maria Nuova suffered so much from decay and restoring that the defects peculiar to the Flemings became unduly prominent as time and neglect effaced the brilliancy and harmony of the principal colours. We can only discern at the present day that the art of Van der Goes is a variety of that which characterizes Van Eyck and Van der Weyden. Less finished and less coloured than the work of the first, it is less subtle and expressive than that of the second. It lacks depth of religious feeling, and hardly rises above the common level of the school in respect of feeling or execution. It is a cold and stiff art, marked by hardness of surface, dryness of contour, angularity of drapery, overladen ornament, and ill-balanced light and shade. Imposing because composed of figures of unusual size, the altar-piece is more remarkable for portrait character than for charms of ideal beauty. There are small pieces in public galleries which claim to have been executed by Van der Goes, but none that are certified as the work of his hands. One of these pictures in the National Gallery in London is more nearly allied to the school of Mending than the triptych of Santa Maria Nuova; another, a small and very beautiful John the Baptist, at the Pinakothek of Munich, is really by Mending; - whilst numerous fragments of an altar-piece in the Belvedere at Vienna, though assigned to Hugo, are by his more gifted countryman of Bruges. Any one who visits Continental collections will see that the name of Van der Goes was given to pictures of which he could not have been the author. None of the compositions mentioned by historians have survived except the altar-piece of Florence. But Van der Goes was not habitually a painter of easel pieces. He made his reputation at Bruges by producing coloured hangings in distemper. After he settled at Ghent, and became a master of his guild in 1465, he designed cartoons for glass windows. He also made decorations for the wedding of Charles the Bold and Margaret of York in 1468, for the festivals of the Rhetoricians and papal jubilees on repeated occasions, for the solemn entry of Charles the Bold into Ghent in 1470-1, and for the funeral of Philip the Good in 1474. The labour which he expended on these occasions might well add to his fame without being the less ephemeral. About the year 1475 he retired to the monastery of Rouge Cloître near Ghent, where he took the cowl. There, though he still clung to his profession, he seems to have taken to drinking, and at one time to have shown decided symptoms of insanity. But his superiors gradually cured him of his intemperance, and he died in the odour of sanctity in 1482.
