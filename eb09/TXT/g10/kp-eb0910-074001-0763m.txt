GOLCONDA, a fortress and ruined city, situated in the Nizâm’s Dominions, 7 miles west of Hyderabad city. In former times Golconda was a large and powerful kingdom of the Deccan, which arose on the downfall of the Bâlimani dynasty, but was subdued by Aurungzebe in 1687, and annexed to the dominions of the Delhi empire. The fortress of Golconda, situated on a rocky ridge of granite, is extensive, and contains many enclosures. It is strong and in good repair, but is commanded by the summits of the enormous and massive mausolea of the ancient kings about 600 yards distant. These buildings, which are now the chief characteristics of the place, f rm a vast group, situated in an arid, rocky desert. They have suffered considerably from the ravages of time, but more from the hand of man, and nothing but the great solidity of their walls has preserved them from utter ruin. These tombs were erected at a great expense, some of them being said to have cost as much as £150,000. Golconda fort is now used as the nizâm’s treasury, and also as the state prison. The diamonds of Golconda have obtained great celebrity throughout the world; but they were merely cut and polished here, being generally found at Partial, near the south-eastern frontier of the nizâm’s territory.
