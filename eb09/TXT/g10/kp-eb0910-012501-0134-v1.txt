GAZA, Theodorus (c. 1400-1478), one of the leaders of the revival of learning in the 15th century, was born at Thessalonica about the year 1400. On the capture of his native city by the Turks in 1430 he removed to Mantua, where he rapidly acquired a competent knowledge of Latin under the teaching of Victorino de Feltre, supporting himself meanwhile by giving lessons in Greek, and by copying manuscripts of the ancient classics. About 1440 he became professor of Greek in the newly founded university of Ferrara, to which students in great numbers from all parts of Italy were soon attracted by his fame a3 a teacher. He had taken some part in the councils which were held in Ferrara (1438), Florence (1439), and Siena (1440), with the object of bringing about a reconciliation between the Greek and Latin Churches; and in 1450, responding to the invitation of Pope Nicholas V., he went to Rome, where he was for some years employed by his patron in making Latin translations from Aristotle and other Greek authors. From 1456 to 1458 he lived at Naples under the patronage of Alphonso the Magnanimous; and shortly after the latter date he was appointed by Cardinal Bessarion to a benefice in the south of Italy, where the later years of his life were spent, and where he died at an advanced age in 1478. Gaza stood high in the opinion of most of his learned contemporaries, but still higher in that of the scholars of the succeeding generation. His Greek grammar, in Greek (γραμματικής dσaγωγης βιβλία δ), first printed at Venice in 1495, and afterwards partially translated by Erasmus in 1521, although in many respects defective, especially in its syntax, has done good service in the cause of sound learning. His translations were very numerous, including the Problemata, De Historia Animalium, De Partibus Animalium, and De Generatione Animalium of Aristotle, the Historia Plantarum and De Causis Plantarum of Theophrastus, the Problemata of Alexander Aphrodisias, the De Instruendis Aciebus of Aelian, and some of the Homilies of Chrysostom. He also turned into Greek Cicero’s De Senectute and Somnium Scipionis, — with much success, in the opinion of Erasmus; with more elegance than exactitude, according to the colder judgment of modern scholars. He was the author also of two small treatises entitled De Mensibus and De Origine Turearum.
