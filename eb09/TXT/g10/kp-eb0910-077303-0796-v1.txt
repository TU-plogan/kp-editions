+=====================================================================+


GOOD, John Mason (1764-1827), a writer on medical, religious, and classical subjects, was born May 25, 1764, at Epping, Essex, where his father, the Rev. Peter Good, was Independent minister. After receiving his education in the seminary conducted by his father, he was, at about the age of fifteen, apprenticed to a surgeon-apothecary at Gosport. In 1783 he went to London to prosecute his medical studies, and in the autumn of 1784 he commenced practice as a surgeon at Sudbury in Suffolk. Through an obligation rendered to a friend he, in 1792, got into pecuniary embarrassment, and, with a view to surmount his difficulties, he removed in 1793 to London, where he entered into partnership with a surgeon and apothecary who enjoyed an extensive practice. In November of the same year he was admitted a member of the college of surgeons. On account of disagreements with his colleague, the partnership was soon afterwards dissolved, and to increase his income he now devoted more of his attention to literary pursuits. Besides contributing both in prose and poetry to the Analytical and Critical Reviews, and the British and Monthly Magazines, and other periodicals, he is the author of a large number of works relating chiefly to medical and religious subjects. In 1794 he became a member of the British Pharmaceutical Society, and in that connexion, and especially by the publication of his work, A History of Medicine, he did much to effect a greatly needed reform in the profession of the apothecary. In 1820 he took the diploma of M.D. at Marischal College, Aberdeen. He died, January 2, 1827. Dr Good was not only well versed in classical [9:10:774] literature, but was acquainted with the principal European languages, and also with Persian, Arabic, and Hebrew. His prose works display wide erudition and considerable intellectual vigour, and contain much interesting and curious information; but their style is dull and tedious, and they are now very generally forgotten. His poetry never rises above pleasant and well-versified commonplace.

The following are his principal writings :— Maria, an elegiac ode, 1786; Diseases of Prisons and Poorhouses, 1795; History of Medi cine, 1795; Parish Workhouses, 1798; Song of Songs, translated from the Hebrew, with notes critical and explanatory , 1803; 77ι- urnph of Britain, an Ode, 1803; Memoirs of the Life and Writings cf Alex. Geddes, LL.D., 1803; The Nature of Things: a Didactic Poem, translated from the Latin of Titus Lucretius Carιιs, with the original text and notes philological and explanatory, 1805-7, 2 vols. 4to, which is still of considerable value for its parallel passages and . quotations both from European and Asiatic languages; Oration on the Structure and Physiology of Plants, 1808; Essay on Medical Technology, 1810; The Book of Job literally translated, &c., 1812; The Study of Medicine, 1822, 4 vols. 8vo, 3d ed. in 1832, edited by Dr Samuel Cooper; and The Book of Nature, 1826, 3 vols. See Memoirs by Olinthus Gregory, LL.D., 1828, and a biographical sketch in the Gentleman's Magazine for March 1827. His Thoughts for all Seasons, in Prose and Verse, was published, with a short biographical sketch, in 1860.
