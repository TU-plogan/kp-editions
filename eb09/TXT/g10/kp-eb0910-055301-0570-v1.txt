GESENIUS, Friedrich Heinrich WTlhelm (1786— 1842), Orientalist and biblical critic, was born at Nordhausen, Hanover, on the 3d of February 1786. From the gymnasium of his native town he passed in 1803 as a student of philosophy and theology to the university of Helmstadt, where Henke was his most influential teacher; but the latter part of his undergraduate course was taken at Gottingen, where Eichhorn and T. C. Tychsen were then at the height of their popularity. In 1806, shortly after graduation, he became “repetent” and “privat-docent” in that university; and, as he was fond of afterwards relating, had Neander for his first pupil in Hebrew. In 1809, on the recommendation of Johann von Müller, he was appointed to a mastership in the gymnasium of Heiligenstadt, Westphalia, whence, in the following year, he was transferred to the university of Halle, where, from being professor extraordinarius in theology, lie was in a very short time promoted to an ordinary chair (1811). Many offers were subsequently made to him of high preferment elsewhere, but he clung to Halle for the remainder of his life, and taught with great [9:10:554] regularity for upwards of thirty years, the only interruptions indeed being that of 1813-14, occasioned by the war of liberation, during which the university was closed, and those occasioned by two prolonged literary tours, first in 1820 to France and England in the society of his colleague Thilo for the examination of rare Oriental manuscripts, and afterwards in 1835 to England and Hollaud in connexion with his Phoenician studies. At a very early period he became the most popular teacher of Hebrew and of Old Testament introduction and exegesis in Germany; and during his later years the annual number of students attending his lectures on these and kindred subjects, such as church history and Biblical archaeology, amounted to nearly 500. Of his pupils many have risen to great eminence in the departments he specially cultivated; among these the names of Von Bohlen, Hoffmann, Hupfeld, Rödiger, Tuch, Vatke, and Benfey may be mentioned. In 1827 Gesenius was made a consistorialrath; but, unless account be taken of the violent attacks to which he, along with his friend and colleague Wegscheider, was in 1830 subjected by Hengstenberg and his party in the Evangelische Kirchenzeitung, there are few noteworthy occurrences to be recorded in his biography. His death took place at Halle, October 23, 1842. It would be difficult to overestimate the services rendered by Gesenius to Semitic philology. To him belongs in a large measure the credit of having freed it from the trammels of theological and religious prepossession by which it had previously been hampered, and of inaugurating the strictly scientific method which has since been so fruitful in valuable results. Nor can it be doubted that as au exegete he has exercised a powerful, and on the whole a beneficial, influence on the tendencies of modern theological investigation.

Of his very numerous works the earliest, published, in 1810, entitled Versuch uber die Maltesische Sprache, was a successful refutation of the widely current opinion that the modem Maltese was of Punic origin. In the same year appeared the first volume of the Hebräisches u. Ghaldäisches Handwörteriruch, completed in 1812 (8th ed., 1878; English translation by Tregelles, 1846-52). The Hebräische Grammatik, published in 1813 (22d ed., by Kautzsch, 1878), was followed in 1815 by the Geschichte der Hebräischen Sprache (now very rare), and in 1817 by the Ausführliches Lehrgebäude der Hebräischen Sprache. The first volume of his well-known commentary on Isaiah {Der Prophet Jcsajd), with a translation, appeared in 1821; but the work was not completed until 1829. The Thesaurus philologico-criticus Lingua Hebraicae et Chaldaicoe V. T., begun in 1829, he did not live to complete; the latter part of the third volume is edited by Rödiger (1858). The other works of Gesenius are De Pentateuchi Samaritani Origine, Indole, et Auctoritate (1815), supplemented in 1822 and 1824 by the treatise De Samaritanorum theologia, and by an edition of Carmina Samaritana; PaläographiscJie Studien uber Phönizische u. Punischc Schrift (1835), a pioneering work which he followed up in 1837 by his collection of Phoenician monuments {Scripturee lingueeque Phoeniciae monumenta guotguot supersunt'); an Aramaic lexicon (1834-39); and a treatise on the Himyaritic language written in conjunction with Rödiger in 1841. Gesenius also contributed extensively to Erseh and Graber’s Encyclopädie, and enriched the German translation of Burckhardt , s7'rarc⅛ in Syria and the Holy Land with valuable geographical notes. For many years he also edited the Halle Allgemeine Litcraturzcitung. A well executed sketch of his life was published in 1843 {Gesenius: eine Erinnerung für seine Freunde).
