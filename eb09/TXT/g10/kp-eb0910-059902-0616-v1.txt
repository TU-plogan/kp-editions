GILLESPIE, George (1613-1648), a prominent member of the presbyterian party in the Westminster Assembly, was born at Kirkcaldy, where his father was parish minister, on the 21st of January 1613, and entered the university of St Andrews as a “presbytery bursar” in 1629. On the completion of a brilliant student career, he became domestic chaplain to Lord Kenmure, and afterwards to the earl of Cassilis, his conscience not permitting him to accept the episcopal ordination which was at that time in Scotland an indispensable condition of induction to a parish. While with the earl of Cassilis he wrote his first work, A Dispute against the English Popish Ceremonies obtruded upon the Church of Scotland, which, opportunely published (but without the author’s name) in the summer of 1637, attracted considerable attention, and within a few months had been found by the privy council to be so damaging that by their orders all available copies were called in and burnt. In April 1638, soon after the authority of the bishops had been set aside by the nation, Gillespie was ordained minister of Wemyss (Fife) by the presbytery of Kirkcaldy, and in the same year was a member of the famous Glasgow Assembly, before which he preached a sermon so pronounced against royal interference in matters ecclesiastical as to call for some remonstrance on the part of Argyll, the Lord High Commissioner. In 1642 Gillespie was translated to Edinburgh; but the brief remainder of his life was chiefly spent in the conduct of public business in London. Already, in 1640, he had accompanied the commissioners of the peace to England as one of their chaplains; and in 1643 he was appointed by the Scottish church one of the four commissioners to the Westminster Assembly. Here he took a prominent part in almost all the protracted discussions on church government, discipline, and worship, supporting Presbyterianism by numerous controversial writings, as well as by .an unusual fluency and readiness in debate. On the Erastian question, in particular, besides a series of vigorous pamphlets against Coleman (A Brotherly Examination of some Passages in Mr Colemaujs late printed Sermon, &c.; Fihil Respondes -, Male Audis), he published in 1646 a large work entitled Aaron’s Rod Blossoming, or the Divine Ordinance of Church-government vindicated, which is deservedly regarded as a really able statement of the case for an exclusive spiritual jurisdiction of the Church. Shortly after his return to Scotland, Gillespie was elected moderator of the Assembly (1648 z ; but the laborious duties of that office (the court continued to sit from 12th July to the 12th of August) told fatally on a constitution which, at no time very vigorous, had of late years been much overtaxed, and, after many weeks of great weakness, he died at Kirkcaldy on the 17th of December 1648. In acknowledgment of his great public services, a sum of <£1000 Scots was voted, though destined never to be paid, to his widow and children by the committee of estates. A simple tombstone, which had been erected to his memory in Kirkcaldy parish church, was in 1661 publicly broken at the cross by the hand of the common hangman, but was restored in 1746. Among the other works of Gillespie may be mentioned the Treatise of miscellany Questions, τνherein many useful Questions and cases of Conscience are discussed and resolved, published posthumously (1649); and The Ark of the Testament opened, being a treatise on the covenant of grace, also posthumous (2 vols., 1661-1677).
