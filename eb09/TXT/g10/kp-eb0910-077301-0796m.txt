GONZALO DE BERCEO, mystic and didactic poet, and one of the earliest names in Castilian literature, -was parish priest at Berceo, near San Domingo de la Calzada, in the province of Burgos, and lived, it is believed, during the first sixty years of the 13th century. His works, which are reprinted in the Poesias Castellanas Anteriores al Siglo XV. of Sanchez, amount to upwards of 13,000 lines of verse, chiefly in rhymed quatrains. The subjects chosen for treatment are the Lives of San Domingo de Silos, Santa Oria, and San Millan; the Sacrifice of the Mass; the Miracles, Glories, and Pains of the Blessed Virgin; the Signs of the Day of Judgment; and the Martyrdom of San Lorenzo. Apart from the interest which attaches to them in the eyes of the literary and ecclesiastical archaeologist, they have little to attract the modern reader. The monotony of their “sermo pedestris” is but seldom relieved by any touches of poetical genius; in some places, however, as Ticknor remarks, there is a simple-hearted piety that is very attractive, and in others a power in story telling that is very striking. The poem on the Miracles of the Virgin, which is the largest, is also the most curious; but that upon the Signs of the Last Day is often very solemn, while the Mourning of Mary at the Cross breathes such a childlike spirit of gentle, faithful, credulous devotion as enables one to realize with some vividness many of the best characteristics of the religious life of the time.
