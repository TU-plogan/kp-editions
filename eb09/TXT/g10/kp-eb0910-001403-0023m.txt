GAGERN, Hans Christoph Ernst, Baron von (1766-1852), a German statesman and political writer, was born at Kleinniederheim, near Worms, January 95, 1766. After completing his studies at the universities of Leipsic and Göttingen, he entered the service of the prince of Orange-Nassau, whom in 1791 he represented at the imperial diet. He was afterwards appointed ambassador to Paris, where he remained till the decree of Napoleon, forbidding all persons born on the left side of the Rhine to serve any other power than France, compelled him to resign his office. He then retired to Vienna, and in 1812 he endeavoured to promote insurrection against Napoleon in Tyrol, On the failure of thi3 attempt he left Austria and joined the headquarters of the Prussian army. When the prince of Orange became king of the Netherlands, Baron Gagern was appointed his prime minister, and in 1815 he represented him at the congress of Vienna, and succeeded in obtaining for the Netherlands a considerable aggrandisement of territory. From 1816 to 1818 he continued to be Netherland ambassador at the German diet, where, while endeavouring to promote German unity, he also advocated the adoption of measures which should secure the indepcnd∙ ence of the individual states. In 1820 he retired with a pension to his estate of Hornau, in Hesse-Darmstadt; but, as a member of the first chamber of the states of the grand duchy, he continued to take an active share in the promotion[9:10:15] of measures for the welfare of his country. He retired from public life in 1848, and died at Hornau, 22d October 1852. Three of the sons of Baron Gagem have attained considerable eminence—one as a soldier, and two, who are still living (1879), as politicians.
