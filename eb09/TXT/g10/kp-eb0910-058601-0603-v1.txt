GIBSON, Edmund (1669-1748), bishop of London, the learned compiler of the Codex Juris Ecclesiastici Anglicani, was born at Bampton in Westmoreland in 1669. After a promising career at one of the local schools, he was in 1686 entered a scholar at Queen’s College, Oxford, where, at the early age of twenty-two (1692), he distinguished himself by the publication of a valuable edition of the Saxon Chronicle, with a Latin translation, indices, and notes. This was followed in 1693 by an annotated edition of the De Institutione Oratoria of Quintilian, and in 1694 by a translation in two volumes folio of Camden’s Britannia, “with additions and improvements,” in the preparation of which he had been largely assisted by the volunteered aid of various English antiquaries. Shortly after Tenison’s elevation to the see of Canterbury in 1694 Gibson was appointed chaplain and librarian to the archbishop, and at a somewhat later period he became rector of Lambeth and archdeacon of Surrey. In the discussions which arose during the reigns of William and Anne relative to the rights and privileges of the Convocation, Gibson took a very active part, and in a series of pamphlets warmly argued for the right of the archbishop to continue or prorogue that assembly. The controversy suggested to him the idea of those researches which resulted in the Codex Juris Ecclesiastici Anglicani, published in two vols, folio in 1713,—a work which discusses more learnedly and comprehensively than any other the legal rights and duties of the English clergy, and the constitution, canons, and articles of the English Church. In 1715 Gibson was presented to the see of Lincoln, whence he was in 1723 translated to that of London, where for twenty-five years he exercised an immense influence, being the authority chiefly consulted by the court on all ecclesiastical affairs. While a conservative in church politics, he yet respected the various forms of dissent, and discouraged all attempts to prevent dissenters from worshipping in the manner and according to the principles which they preferred. He exercised a vigilant oversight over the morals of all ranks and classes of the community committed to his charge; and his fearless denunciation of the licentious masquerades which had become highly popular at court finally lost him the royal favour. Among the literary efforts of his later years the principal were a series of Pastoral Letters in defence of the “gospel revelation,” against “lukewarmness” and “enthusiasm,” and on various topics of the day; also the Preservative against Popery, in 3 vols, folio (1738), a compilation of numerous controversial writings of eminent Church of England divines, dating chiefly from the period of James II. Gibson died on the 6th September 1748.

A second edition of the Codex Juris, “revised and improved, with large additions by the author,” w⅛s published at Oxford in 1761. Besides the works already mentioned, Gibson published a number of Sermons, and other works of a religious and devotional kind. The Vita Thom(e Bodleii with the Historia Bibliotheca Bodleianoe in the Catalogi librorum manuscriptonιm (Oxford, 1697), and the Reliqwioe Spelmànnianoe (Oxford, 1698), are also from his pen.
