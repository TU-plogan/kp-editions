GERACE or Gieraci, a town of Italy in the province of Reggio di Calabria, about 59 miles from Reggio on the railway between that city and Monasterace, is situated on a limestone hill not far from the coast, 30 miles N.N.E. of Cape Spartivento, between the rivers Merico and Novito. It is the seat of a bishop and of a subprefect, and has a civil and criminal court dependent on that of Catanzaro. The citadel, formerly of great strength, was reduced to ruins by the earthquake of 1793; and the cathedral was at the same time so severely injured that only a portion of the crypt remained available for public worship. There is a good trade in a white wine known as Vino Greco; silk is manufactured; and the warm sulphur springs of the neigbourhood attract patients to the town. About 5 miles off, at Torre di Gerace, are the ruins of the Greek city of Locri Epi zephyrii, from which Gerace derived materials for its buildings, and more especially fine marble columns for the cathedral. The population in 1871 was 7257. This Gerace is not to be confounded with Gerace Siculo, a town of between 3000 and 4000 inhabitants, 4 miles from Cefalu, which was the first place in Sicily erected into a marquisate.
