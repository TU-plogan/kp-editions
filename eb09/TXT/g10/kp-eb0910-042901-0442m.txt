+====================================================================+


GEORGE of Cappadocia, who from 356 to 361 was Arian archbishop of Alexandria, was born about the beginning of the 4th century. According to Ammianus (xxii. 11), he was a native of Epiphania, in Cilicia; but universal tradition makes him a Cappadocian. Gregory Nazianzen tells us that his father was a fuller, and that he himself soon became notorious as a parasite of so mean a type that he would “sell himself for a cake.” By his powers of insinuation he succeeded in obtaining a lucrative contract for sup plying bacon to the army, but fulfilled its terms so ill that he was soon compelled to abscond after he had with difficulty escaped death at the hands of the indignant soldiers. After many wanderings, in the course of which he seems to have lived for some time at Constantinople, and to have amassed a considerable fortune as receiver of taxes, he ultimately reached Alexandria. It is not known how or when he obtained ecclesiastical orders; but, after Athanasius had been banished in 356, George was promoted by the influence of the then prevalent Arian faction to the vacant see. His persecutions and oppressions of the orthodox ultimately raised a rebellion which compelled him to flee for his life; but his authority was restored, although with difficulty, by a military demonstration. Untaught by experience he resumed his course of selfish tyranny over Christians and heathen alike, and raised the irritation of the populace to such a pitch that, within a few days after the accession of Julian, they rose en masse, dragged him out of prison, where he had been placed by the magistrates for safety, paraded him with every indignity through the streets on the back of a camel, burnt his dead body, and cast the ashes into the sea (December 24, 361). With much that was sordid and brutal in his character George combined a highly cultivated literary taste, and in the course of his chequered career he had found the means of collecting a splendid library, which Julian ordered to be carefully preserved and conveyed to Antioch for his own use. The original sources for the facts of the life of George of Cappadocia are Ammianus, Gregory Nazianzen, Epiphanias, and Athanasius. In modern times his character has been drawn with graphic fidelity by Gibbon in the 23d chapter of the Decline and Fall.
