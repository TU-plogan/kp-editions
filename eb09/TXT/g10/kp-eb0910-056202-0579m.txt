GHEEL, or Geel, a town of Belgium, in the province of Antwerp, about 25 miles E. of Antwerp, on the railway between Herenthals and Moll, with a population, according to the census of 1876, of 10,265. Situated in the midst of that half barren stretch of moorland which is known as the Campine or Kampenland, it would have been of little importance, in spite of its manufactures of cloth, leather, wooden shoes, and wax-lights, had it not for long centuries been the seat of a unique method of dealing with the insane. A local legend, tracing the origin of the town back to a chapel of St Martin erected in the 7th century, goes on to tell how an Irish princess, fearing the fate that long afterwards befel Beatrice Cenci, sought refuge in this remote asylum, but was pursued by her relentless father and put to death, along with a priest Gerrebert, the companion of her flight. The tomb of the victims was soon discovered to have a healing virtue for minds diseased: the sainted Dymphna became the patroness of the insane; and a large and beautiful church in her honour was erected on the site of St Martin’s chapel. Commenced in the 12th century, it was finished in 1340, and consecrated by the bishop of Cambray; and the pilgrimages to the tomb were sanctioned by a brief of Eugenius IV. In 1538 Jean de Mérode, within whose domains the church was situated, instituted a vicariate of nine priests and a director, and in 1562 Henri de Mérode transformed the vicariate into a regular chapter of nine canons and a dean. The church still remains to bear witness to the importance formerly attached to the shrine; and though the tomb of St Dymphna has long been a cenotaph, a few stray enthusiasts still pass beneath it in hopeful imitation of the thousands in byegone years, whose knees have worn deep furrows in the pavement as they made their ninefold transits on nine successive days. As food and lodging had to be provided for the patients who were brought to the saint, the inhabitants of Gheel grew accustomed to the treatment of the various kinds of mental alienation, and gradually discovered that forcible measures were much less frequently necessary, and danger less likely to result from free intercourse with the insane, than was generally believed throughout Europe. When M. Pontecoulant was appointed by Napoleon prefect of the Revolution department of the Dyle, his attention was called to the success of the domestic régime in force at Gheel, in contrast to the sad condition of affairs in the asylum at Brussels, and he caused the patients to be removed from the capital to the little country town. His example was freely followed by the authorities of different districts, and Gheel received full official recognition. Investigations undertaken about 1850 by M. Ducpétiaux, inspector-general of benevolent establishments in Belgium, resulted in the reform of such abuses as had crept into the system; and the relations of the patient and his protectors were placed on a strict legal footing by the law of 1st May 1851. Further ameliorations have been introduced in 1852,1857, 1858, &c. The whole management of the system is under the supervision of officially appointed physicians, and the advantages of a regular establishment are thus combined with those of domestic comfort, social freedom, and activity. Permission to receive patients is granted not only to the town residents, but also to the villagers of the vicinity.
