GELL, Sir William (1777-1836), classical scholar and antiquarian, was born at Hopton in Derbyshire in 1777. After the usual preliminary education, he entered Emmanuel College, Cambridge, taking his B.A. degree in 1798, and afterwards becoming a fellow. About the beginning of the century he was sent on a diplomatic mission to Greece; and on his return in 1803 he was knighted. In the following year he published his Topography of Troy and its Vicinity, illustrated and explained by drawings and descriptions. His Geography and Antiquities of Ithaca was published in 1807. In 1810 appeared The Itinerary of Greece, with a Commentary on Pausanias and Strabo, and an account of monuments of antiquity existing in that country. This was followed in 1816 by the Itinerary of the Horea, being a description of the routes of that peninsula, a new edition of which was published in 1823, under the title of Narrative of a Journey in the AIorea. His best known work is Pompeiana, or Observations on the Topography, Edifices, and Ornaments of Pompeii, in which he was assisted by Mr J. P. Gandy. The first part of this was published in 1817-19, and was translated into French in 1828; the second part appeared in 1830-31. It was followed in 1834 by the Topography of Pome and its Vicinity. In Italy, whither he had retired on account of his health, he became acquainted with Queen Caroline, and his noble and disinterested behaviour during her trial exhibits his moral character in a very favourable light. The queen showed her sense of his co-operation in her defence by appointing him one of her chamberlains in 1820. He died at Naples in 1836. His drawings, representing a very large series of views of classical ruins and localities, and executed, if not with much artistic skill, yet with great detail and exactness, are now in the print room of the British Museum.
