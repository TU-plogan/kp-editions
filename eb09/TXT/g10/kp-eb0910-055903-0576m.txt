GHÂZÎPUR, a district of British India, in the lieutenantgovernorship of the North-Western Provinces, and included in the Benares division. It is bounded on the N. by Azimgarh and Sâran, E. by Sâran, S. by Shâhâbâd, and W. by Benares and Jaunpur. Ghâzipur forms part of the great alluvial plain of the Ganges, which divides it into two unequal portions. The northern subdivision lies between the Gumti and the Gogrâ, whose confluences with the main stream mark its eastern and western limits respectively. The southern tract is a much smaller strip of country, enclosed between the Karamnâsa and the great river itself. No hill or natural eminence is to be found in the district. A few lakes are scattered here and there, formed where the rivers have deserted their ancient channels. The largest is that of Surâha, once a northern bend of the Ganges, but now an almost isolated sheet of water, 5 miles long by about 4 broad.

Ghâzipur is a closely cultivated district, and out of a total area of 2168 square miles 1546 are actually under cultivation. The harvests are the same as those common to the whole of the plain districts of the North-Western Provinces. The census of 1872 returned a total population in Ghâzipur district of 1,345,570 souls (males 696,572, females 648,829), dwelling in 3725 villages or townships, and inhabiting 285,007 houses. The Hindus numbered 1,221,810, or 90 - 7 per cent., and Mahometans, 123,455. Of the three higher Hindu castes there were—Brâhmans, 123,012; Râjputs, 295,355; and Baniyâs, 49,538. The lower castes are represented by the Ahirs, 171,216; Châmârs, 122,075; Kâyasths, 22,480; and Kurmis, 18,136. Amongst the Mussulmans, the Shaikhs numbered 26,940; Sayyids, 4525; Mughals, 570; and Pathâns, 18,452. The district is rich, and in the eastern parts the soil is extremely fertile, so that the cultivators are, on the whole, in easy circumstances. Sixteen towns contain a population exceeding 5000, viz., Ghâzipur, 38,853; Mahatwar Khâs, 8975; Shiupur Diar, 9279; Gahmar, 9050; Sherpur, 7958; Riotipur, 9323; Bâra, 5424; Chit, 5821; Narhi, 5527; Bansdih, -7319; Rioti, 7700; Maniar, 5285; Ballia, 8521; Bairia, 5589; Sonbarsa, 7162; and Rasra, 7261. The chief imports into the district are English piece goods and thread, cotton, salt, spices, and grain; the principal exports, country cloth, sugar, fuller’s earth, oil seeds, and hides. The headquarters of the Government opium manufacture is at Ghâzipur town. Carbonate of soda is manufactured from the reh or saline efflorescence of the barren usαr plains, and largely exported. Saltpetre is also largely prepared from the same source. The great trade route is the Ganges, but good roads connect all the principal centres with each other. The East Indian Railway runs for 24 miles through the district, with stations at Zamâniah, Dildarnagar, and Gahmar. The total amount of imperial, local, and municipal revenue of the district in 1876 was £200,000. Ghâzipur is said to be one of the hottest and dampest districts in the North-Western Provinces. In 1869 the annual mean temperature was 80° Fahr., the lowest monthly mean being 61° Fahr., in January, and the highest 98°, in May. The average total rainfall for 11 years from 1860 to 1871 was 40 T inches, the maximum being 50 ‘5 inches, in 1861, and the minimum 21’5 inches, in 1868.

Ghâzipur Town, the capital of the district, stands on the low alluvial northern bank of the Ganges, in 35° 23' 36" N. lat. and 83° 35' 13" E. long., covering an area of 416 acres, and with a population in 1872 of 38,853. There is considerable trade in sugar, tobacco, long cloth, and rose water. It is the headquarters of the Government opium department, where all the opium from the North-Western Provinces is collected and manufactured under a monopoly. A metalled road runs from Ghâzipur to Zamâniah station on the East Indian Railway, 13⅜ miles. Lord Cornwallis, the governor-general of India, died at Ghâzipur in 1805, and a monument and marble statue are erected over his grave.
