GICHTEL, Johann Georg (1638-1710), founder of the mystic sect of Gichtelians or Angelic Brethren, was born at Ratisbon, where his father was a member of senate, on the 14th of March 1638. Having acquired at school, besides an ordinary elementary education, a considerable acquaintance with Greek, Hebrew, Syriac, and even Arabic, he proceeded to Strasburg to study divinity; but finding that the theological prelections of Schmidt and Spener there were not conducive to the growth of his piety, he removed to Spires, where he entered the faculty of law. In 1664 he was admitted an advocate at Ratisbon; but having become acquainted with the Baron von Weitz, an Hungarian nobleman who cherished enthusiastic if not extravagant schemes for the reunion of Christendom and the conversion of the world, he abandoned all interest in his profession, and became an energetic promoter of the “Christerbauliche Jesusgesellschaft,” or Christian Edification Society of Jesus, in the interests of which he visited many parts of Germany and Holland. The movement in its beginnings provoked at least no active hostility; but when Gichtel began to attack the teaching of the Lutheran clergy and church, especially upon the fundamental doctrine of justification by faith, he exposed himself to a prosecution which ultimately resulted in sentence of banishment and confiscation (1665). After many months of wandering and occasionally romantic adventure, he in January 1667 reached Holland, and settled at Zwoll, where he co-operated with Breckling, a man who shared his views and aspirations. Having become involved in the troubles of this friend, Gichtel, after a period of imprisonment, was banished for a term of years from Zwoll, but finally in 1668 found a home in Amsterdam, where in a state of poverty (which, however, never became destitution), he lived out his strange life of visions and day-dreams, of prophecy and prayer. He became ail ardent student and disciple of Jacob Boehme, whose works he published in 1682 (Amsterdam, 2 vols.); but before the time of his death, which occurred January 21, 1710, he had attracted to himself a small band of followers known as Gichtelians or Angelic Brethren, who propagated certain views at which he had arrived independently of Boehme. Seeking ever to hear the authoritative voice of God within them, and endeavouring to attain to a life altogether free from carnal desires, like that of “the angels in heaven, who neither marry nor are given in marriage,” they claimed to exercise a priesthood “after the order of Melchizedek,” appeasing the wrath of God, and ransoming the souls of the lost by sufferings endured vicariously after the example of Christ. The sect, never a numerous one, is said still to subsist in some districts of Holland and North Germany. Gichtel’s correspondence was published without his knowledge by Gottfried Arnold, a disciple, in 1701 (2 vols.), and again in 1708 (3 vols.). It has been frequently reprinted under the title Theosophia Practica. The seventh volume of the Berlin edition (1768) contains a notice of Gichtel’s life.
