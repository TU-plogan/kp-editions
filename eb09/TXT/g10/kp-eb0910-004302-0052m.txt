GALLOWAY, Thomas (1796-1851), a Scottish mathematician, was born at Symington, in the upper ward of Lanarkshire, 26th February 1796. After receiving such education as the schools of his own and adjoining parishes could give, he entered in 1812 the university of Edinburgh, where he distinguished himself specially in mathematics. In 1823 he was appointed one of the teachers of mathematics at the military college of Sandhurst, and on the death of Sir John Leslie in 1832 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the vacant chair of natural philosophy in Edinburgh. In the following year he was appointed actuary to the Amicable Life Assurance Office, the oldest institution of that kind in London, and in this situation he remained till his death, November 1,1851. Galloway was a voluminous though, for the most part, an anonymous writer, and took a leading part in the proceedings of the principal scientific societies of London. He contributed largely to the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and also wrote several scientific papers for the Edinburgh and Foreign Quarterly Reviews. His Encyclopaedia article “Probability” was published separately.
