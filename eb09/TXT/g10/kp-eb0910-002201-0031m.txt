GALBANUM (Hebrew, Chelbenah∙, Greek, γαλβavr ∣ ), a gum-resin, believed to be the product of Ferula galbaniflua, Boiss. et. Buhse, and F. rubricaulis, Boiss., indigenous to Persia, and perhaps also of other umbelliferous plants. From the stems of these it is said to exude as a milk-white juice, which is rendered yellow by exposure to light and air. It occurs usually iu hard or soft, irregular, more or less translucent aud shining lumps, composed of agglutinated drops or tears, or occasionally in separate tears, and is of a light-brown, yellowish, or greenish-yellow colour, and has a disagreeable bitter taste, a peculiar, somewhat musky odour, and a specific gravity of 1 , 212. Exposed to cold, it becomes brittle, and may be reduced to powder (Pereira). To separate the vegetable and other impurities commonly present in it, galbanum is melted at 100° C., and strained. On analysis 100 parts yield about 65 of resin soluble in ether and alkaline liquids, 20 to 25 of gum, aud about 7 of volatile oil. The last furnishes a colourless crystallizable substance, umbelliferone, C 9 H 6 O 3 , which may be recognized by its formation of a blue colour with ammonia, destroyed by acids. Galbanum oil has been shown by J. Kachler (see Jouτn. Chem. Soc., xxiv., 1871, p. 258) to contain a colourless limpid oil, boiling at 160° to 165° C., and ablue oil, of boiling point 240° to 250° C., varying in quantity with the temperature of distillation, which is isomeric with oil of turpentine, and identical with the oil of Matricaria Chamomilla, L. Galbanum is one of the oldest of drugs. In Exodus xxx. 34 it is mentioned as a sweet spice, to be used in the making of a perfume for the tabernacle. Hippocrates employed it in medicine, and Pliny (Hat. Hist., xxiv. 13) ascribes to it extraordinary curative powers, concluding his account of it with the assertion that “the very touch of it mixed with oil of spondylium is sufficient to kill a serpent.” By Arabian and Persian authors it was termed, barzud, the plants producing it being known as kinneh and ηafeel (Royle, J∕αn∙ of Mat. Med.). Avicenna extols the drug for its emmeuagogue, diuretic, and various other virtues, and as an antidote “for all poisons.” In Chinese writiħgs galbanum, 0-yu, is not met with as a distinct drug (F. Porter Smith). It is now administered for its antispasmodic, expectorant, and stimulant properties. As an antispasmodic it is considered inferior to asafoetida, but superior to ammoniacum, which, however, is more efficacious as an expectorant in asthma. Galbanum (German, Mutterharz) has been supposed to have a stimulating effect upon the uterus, and has been given, combined with salts of iron, in amenorrhoea, and also is recommended in hysteria and neuralgia accompanied by uterine affections. It is an ingredient in the pilula asafoetidoe composita of pharmacy, and in a plaster, emplastrum galbani, which has been found serviceable in cases of indolent tumours and chronic arthritic swellings. Galbanum is imported to some extent from the Levant, but chiefly from India, through Bombay.
