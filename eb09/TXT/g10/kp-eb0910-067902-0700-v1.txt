GLINKA, Michael Ivanovich (1804-1857), a celebrated Russian composer, was born at Novospassky, a village in the Smolensk government, in 1804, and not, as stated generally in the dictionaries, in 1803. His early life he spent at home, but at the age of thirteen we find him at the Blagorodrey Pension, St Petersburg, where he studied music under Carl Maier and John Field, the celebrated Irish composer and pianist, settled in Russia. We are told that in his seventeenth year he had already begun to compose romances and other minor vocal pieces; but of these nothing now is known. His thorough musical training did not begin till the year 1830, when he went abroad and stayed for three years in Italy, to study the works of old and modern Italian masters. His thorough knowledge of the requirements of the voice may be connected with this course of study. His training as a composer was finished under Dehn, the celebrated contrapuntist, with whom Glinka stayed for several months at Berlin. In 1833 he returned to Russia, and devoted himself to operatic composition. On November 27, 1836, took place the first representation of his Life for the Czar. This was the turning point in Glinka’s life,—for the work was not only a great success, but in a manner became the origin and basis of a Russian school of national music. Subject and music combined to bring about this issue. The story is taken from the invasion of Russia by the Poles early in the 17th century, and the hero is a peasant who sacrifices his life for the czar. Glinka has wedded this patriotic theme to inspiring and in some places admirable music. His melodies, moreover, show distinct affinity to the popular songs of the Russians, and for that reason the term “national” maybe justly applied to them. His appointment as imperial chapel-master and conductor of the opera of St Petersburg was the just reward of his dramatic successes. His second opera, Russian and Lyudmila, founded on Poushkin’s poem, did not appear till 1842; but in the meantime he wrote an overture and four entre-actes to Kukolnik’s drama Prince Kholrnsky. In 1844 he went abroad for a second time, and lived chiefly in Paris and Spain. On his return to St Petersburg he wrote and arranged several pieces for the orchestra, amongst which the so-called Karnarinskaya has achieved popularity beyond the [9:10:680] limits of Russia. He also composed numerous songs and romances. In 1857 he went abroad for the third time, and died suddenly at Berlin, on February 14th of that year.
