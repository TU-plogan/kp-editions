GALATINA, a town of Italy, in the province and circondario of Lecce, on the road from Otranto to Taranto. It still preserves its ancient walls and towers, and possesses an interesting Franciscan church and monastery (St Catharineâ€™s), founded in the 14th century by Raimondo Orsini del Balzo, prince of Taranto. The frescos with which the church is richly decorated are of no small historical value. For a long time the inhabitants were attached to the Greek Church. In 1871 they numbered 7873.
