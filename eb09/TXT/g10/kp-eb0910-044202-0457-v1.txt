GERBER, Ernst Ludwig (1746-1819), author of the well-known dictionary of musicians, was born at Sondershausen 29th September 1746. His father, Henry Nicolas Gerber (1702-1775), a pupil of J. S. Bach, was an organist and composer of some distinction, and under his direction Ernst Ludwig at an early age had made great progress in his musical studies. In 1765 he went to Leipsic with the view of studying law, but the claims of music, which had gained additional strength from his acquaintanceship with J. A. Hiller, soon came to occupy almost his sole attention. On his return to Sondershausen he was appointed music teacher to the children of the prince, and in 1775 he succeeded his father as court organist. Latterly he devoted much of his time to the study of the literature and history of music, and with this view he made himself master of several of the modern languages. His Historischbiographisches Lexikon der Tonkünstler appeared in 1790 and 1792 in two volumes; and the first volume of what was virtually an improved and corrected edition of this work was published in 1810 under the title Neues historischbiographisches Lexikon der Tonkünstler, followed by other three volumes in 1812, 1813, and 1814. Gerber also contributed a number of papers to musical periodicals, and published several minor musical compositions. He died at Sondershausen 30th June 1819.
