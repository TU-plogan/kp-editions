GALENA, a city of the United States, the capital of Jo Daviess county, Illinois, is situated on the Fever or Galena river, G miles above its junction with the Mississippi, and on the northern division of the Illinois Central Railroad, 180 miles W.N.W. of Chicago. The city winds around the base of rocky limestone bluffs, which spring rather abruptly from the river on both sides, and the streets rise above one another, and are connected by flights of steps. It is the commercial depot of an extensive and fertile district, but owes its prosperity chiefly to the species of lead from which it takes its name, and the mines of which surround it in all directions, underlying, more or less densely, an area of over 1,500,000 acres. In these mines copper is also found in combination with the galeua. In the earlier years the produce of the mines found its way by water to St Louis, but in 1829 the first load, 3000 lb, was conveyed overland to Chicago. In 1846 the yield reached its highest point of 50,000,000 lb; in 1852 it was 40,000,000; and in 1877 only 3,300,000. This diminution is due to the Absence of the expensive appliances necessary for deep mining. Meanwhile zinc ore has been discovered, of which 12,000,000 ft) were mined in 1877. The lumber produce· is also considerable, averaging 7,000,000 feet annually. The principal buildings are the German-English normal school, the high school, and the building in which are included the custom-house and post-office. Galena has an· iron-foundry, flour-mills, woollen mills, saw and planing mills, besides furnaces and manufactories for lead, zinc, copper, and furniture. Mining commenced in 1820, and in 1822 the United States began to grant leases of the mineral lands. The first street was laid out in 1826; village government was legalised in 1837, and a city charter granted in 1839. Population in 1850, 6004; in 1860, 8196; and in 1870 r 7019, of whom 2473 were foreigners.
