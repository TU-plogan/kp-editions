GLYCAS, Michael, a Byzantine historian, often called Siculus. The time when he flourished is very uncertain. He is justly reckoned among the better Byzantine historians on account of the terseness and perspicuity of his style. His MS. letters still extant are addressed to the last Constantine; their authenticity, however, has been questioned. His chief work is Βίβλος χρονική, divided into four parts, treating of history from the creation of the world to the death of Alexis I. Comnenus (1118). The best edition is that by J. Bekker, in the Bonn collection of the Byzantines (1836).
