GLEBE, in ecclesiastical law, is the land devoted to the maintenance of the incumbent of a church. Burn {Ecclesiastical Law, s.v. “Glebe Lands ”) says :—“Every church of common right is entitled to house and glebe, and the assigning of them at the first was of such absolute necessity that without them no church could be regularly consecrated. The house and glebe are both comprehended under the word manse, of which the rule of the canon law is, sancitum est ut unicuique ecclesiae unus mansus integer absque allo servitio tribuatur.” In the technical language of English law the fee-simple of the glebe is said to be in abeyance, that is, it exists “only in the remembrance, expectation, and intendment of the law.” But the freehold is in the parson, [9:10:677] although at common law he could alienate the same only with proper consent,—that is, in his case, with the consent of the bishop. The disabling statutes of Elizabeth (1 Eliz. c. 19, and 13 Eliz. c. 10) made void all alienations by ecclesiastical persons, except leases for the term of twenty-one years or three lives. As to exchange of glebe lands, see 5 and 6 Vict. c. 54, and 17 and 18 Vict. c. 84. In Scotch ecclesiastical law, the manse now signifies the minister’s dwelling-house, the glebe being the land to which he is entitled in addition to his stipend. All parish ministers appear to be entitled to a glebe, except the ministers in royal burghs proper, who cannot claim a glebe unless there be a landowner’s district annexed; and even in that case, when there are two ministers, it is only the first who has a claim. See Bell’s Dictionary and Digest.
