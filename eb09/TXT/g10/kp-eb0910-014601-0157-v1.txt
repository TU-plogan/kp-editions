GENERATION, a term in general biology or physiology synonymous with the Greek ∕5ιoγεv∈σις and the German Zeugung, may comprehend the whole history of the first origin and continued reproduction of living bodies, whether plants or animals; but it is frequently restricted to the sexual reproduction of animals. The subject, in its most comprehensive aspect, would naturally be divided into the following branches, viz. :—(1) the first origin of life and living beings, (2) non-sexual or agamic reproduction, and (3) garnie or sexual reproduction. The first two of these topics have already been shortly treated of in the articles Abiogenesis and Biology ; the third and more extensive division, including (1) the formation and fecundation of the ovum, and (2) the development of the embryo in different animals, it has been deemed expedient to refer to the heading Reproduction.
