GAeTULIA, or the laud of the Gaetuli, an ancient district of somewhat uncertain limits in northern Africa. It may be roughly said to have been bounded on the N. by Mauretania and Numidia, E. by the country of the Garamantes, S. by the basin of the Niger, and W. by the Atlantic; but the frontiers must have been of a very uncertain and shifting character. The Gaetulians. who, according to a tradition mentioned by Sallust, were one of the two great aboriginal races of northern Africa, appear to have retreated inland before the encroachments of the Numidians and Mauretanians, but continued to make incursions over a wide stretch of country. Ethnographically, they were quite distinct from the negro races, and indeed probably belonged to the great Berber race, which still forms so important an element in the population of North Africa. Their southern tribes having mingled with negro tribes, acquired the distinctive title of Melano-Gaetuli or Black Gaetulians. A warlike, roving people, they bestowed great attention on the rearing of horses, and, according to Strabo, had 100,000 foals in the course of a year. They were clad in skins, lived on flesh and the milk of their cows, mares, and camels, and took almost no advantage of the valuable productions of their country. It was not till the Jugurthine war that they became familiar to the Romans; but afterwards their name occurs with great frequency in Latin poetical literature, and, indeed, the adjective Gaetulian became little more than a synecdoche for African. Allusions are more particularly made to Gaetulian purple, which was obtained from the murex of the African coast. In the Jugurthine war some of the Gaetulian tribes assisted the Numidian king with a contingent of horse; but during the civil war Caesar found among them very serviceable allies in his contest with Juba. Augustus, having made Numidia a Roman province, affected to assign a portion of the Gaetulian territory to Juba as a compensation; but the Gaetulians rose in revolt and massacred the Roman residents, and it was not till a severe defeat had been inflicted on them by Cossius Lentulus that they consented to recognize their gratuitous sovereign. By his victory Lentulus acquired the title of Gaetulicus. Ibn Said in the middle of the 13th century, Ibn Khaldun at the end of the 14 th, Leo Africanus in the beginning of the 16th, and Marmol about sixty years later, are all quoted by Μ. Vivien de St Martin in his Le Nord de VAfrique, 1863, as mentioning a mountainous country called Gozulé, Gutzula, or Guézula in the south of Morocco. He is disposed further to identify the Gaetulians with the Godâla, who, according to Ibn Said, occupied the maritime portion of the great desert, and are referred to by other Arabian geographers as the Djoddala; and it is even possible, he thinks, that their name survives in that of the Ghedala between Cape Blanco and the Lower Senegal on the one hand, and that of the Beni Guechtula in the Algerian province of Bougie on the other.
