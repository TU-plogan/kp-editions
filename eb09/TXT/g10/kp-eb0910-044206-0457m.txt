After studying at Breslau and Berlin, he in 1816 took up his residence at the former town. The reputation he acquired by his Lectiones Apol-lonianae, published in the same year, led soon afterwards to his being appointed professor at the gymnasium of Posen. On resigning that office in 1819, on account of weakness in the eyes, he travelled in Italy, and in 1822 he took up his residence in Rome, where, with the view of prosecuting his archaeological studies, he remained for fifteen years. He there contributed to Platner’s Beschreibung der Stadt Rom, then under the direction of Bunsen, and he was also one of the principal originators of the Instituto di corrispondenza archeologica, founded at Rome in 1828, aud during his stay in Italy its director. After his return to Germany in 1837, he was appointed archaeologist at the Royal Museum of Berlin, and in 1844 he was chosen a member of the Academy of Sciences, and a professor in the university. He died at Berlin 12 th May 1867.
