GABLER, Johann Philipp (1753-1826), a learned Protestant theologian of the school of Griesbach and Eichhorn, was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main, June 4, 1753. He had already acquired an extensive acquaintance with the ancient languages and their literatures, as well as with the philosophy of Wolf and the theology of Baumgarten, when, in his nineteenth year, he entered the university of Jena as a divinity student. In 1776 he was on the point of abandoning theological pursuits, when the arrival of Griesbach inspired him with new ardour. After having [9:10:3] been successively repetent in Göttingen and teacher in the public schools of Dortmund (Westphalia) and Altdorf (Bavaria), he was, in 1793, appointed second professor of theology in the university of the last-named city, whence he was translated to a chair in Jena in 1804. At Altdorf he published (1791-93) a new edition, with introduction and notes, of Eichhorn’s Urgeschichte ; this, was followed, two years afterwards, by a supplement entitled Neuer Versuch uber die mosaische Sclι0]f'ungsgeschichte. He was also the author of several original works which were characterized by much critical acumen, anà which had considerable influence on the course of German thought on theological and biblical questions. From 1798 to 1811 he was editor of the Theologisches Journal, first conjointly with Hänlein, Ammon, and Paulus, and afterwards unassisted. He died at Jena, February 17, 1826.
