GAN DIA, an ancient wall-encircled city of Spain, in the province and archbishopric of Valencia, is beautifully situated in the fertile huerta or garden of Gandia, about 3 miles from the mouth of the river Alcoy. Its most prominent buildings are a large collegiate church, a college of the Escuelas Pias, and a palace of the dukes of Gandia. There is some trade in the produce of the district, especially in fruit; and linen and silk are manufactured to a limited extent. St Francis de Borgia or Borja, third general of the Jesuit order, was duke of Gandia, and spent some years of his life there. Population about 7000.
