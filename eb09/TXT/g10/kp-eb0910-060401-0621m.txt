GINGHAM is a woven cotton fabric, of a close stoutish texture, the distinguishing characteristics of which are that it is a plain (i.e., untwilled) cloth, woven into yarn-dyed stripes or checks of two or more colours. In some cases as many as seven or eight colours are introduced in the warp and weft of a gingham; but no patterns are made that cannot be woven in a common plain loom. Gingham was originally an Indian product, but its manufacture was early introduced into the Lancashire and Glasgow districts; and during the first half of the present century the trade formed an important feature in the textile industries of the latter localityâ€”the demand for the fabric coming chiefly from the United States and the West Indies. The trade distinction of gingham is now to a large extent superseded by other terms.
