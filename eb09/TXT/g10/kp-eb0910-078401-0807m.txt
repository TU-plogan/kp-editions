GOREE (in French Goree, and in the native tongue Bir or Berr, that is, a belly, in allusion to its shape), a small island off the west coast of Africa, belonging to the French colony of the Senegal. It lies immediately to the south of Cape Verd, and, according to the Annuaire du Senegal for 1878, in 14° 39' 55" N. lat. and 12° 16' 40" W. long. The distance from the mainland in one direction is about 8 miles, and in another from 3 to 4. Though little more than a barren rock, Goree is of importance as a commercial and military post, and all the more as it has the advantage of a milder climate than the neighbouring mainland. The greater part of its area is occupied by the town, which was constituted a commune in 1872, and placed under the government of a municipal council of 14 members. The streets are narrow, and the houses, built for the most part of dark red stone, are flat-roofed. Among the principal buildings are the castle of St Michael, which occupies the rocky eminence in the south of the island, the governor’s residence, the hospital, and the barracks. The summit of the rock within the citadel is levelled to an esplanade, and in the centre is a deep Artesian well, the only source in the otherwise arid island, which is dependent on its rain-water tanks for its ordinary supplies. Goree is a free port, and forms a convenient centre for the distribution of European goods. It is regularly visited by the vessels of the British and African Steam Navigation Company. The harbour is formed in a small sandy bay on the north-east side of the island. Telegraphic communication with St Louis dates from 1862. A chamber of commerce was established in 1870, and a sanitary commission in 1874. The town was reported in 1878 to have a population of 3243, and the arrondissement of Gorée-Dakar, of which it is the administrative centre, had a total population of 61,394. Dakar is a new settlement on the mainland, with a port constructed since 1857 for the vessels of the Messageries Maritimes; but with the exception of the public buildings the town has still to be built. Goree owes its name to the Dutch, who took possession of it in the beginning of the 17 th century, and called it Goeree or Goedereede, in memory of the island on their own coast now united with Overflakkee. It was taken from them in 1663 by the English under Commodore Holmes, but recovered in the following year by De Ruyter. They were finally expelled, in 1677, by the French under Admiral D’Estrées, whose conquest was confirmed in 1678 by the peace of Nymwegen. In 1758 the island was captured for the English by Commodore Keppel, but a few years afterwards it was restored to France. With the exception of a few months in 1804, when the island was held by the French, the English were again in possession from 1800, when it was seized by Sir Charles Hamilton, till the peace of 1814.
