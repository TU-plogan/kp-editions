GALLUPPI, Pasquale (1770-1846), a distinguished Italian philosopher, was born on 2d April 1770, at Tropea, in Calabria. He was of good family, and after completing his education at the academy of Tropea and the university of Naples he entered the public service, and was for many years employed in the office of the administration of finances. Altogether apart from academic influences he pursued his favourite studies, and it was not till he had reached the ago [9:10:47] of sixty, and had become widely known by his writings on philosophy, that he was called to a chair in the university of Naples. This chair he held till his death in November 1846. Galluppi’s first work was an essay on analysis and synthesis {Sull ’ Analisa e sulla Sintesι) published in 1807. This was followed by the important Saggio filosofico sulla critica della conoscenza, in 6 volumes, published from 1819 Ίο 1832. In the Lettere filosofiche zulle vicende della filosofia relativamente ai principii delle conoscenze humana, da Cartesio sino a Kant, 1827, by which, through the translation into French (by Μ. Peisse, 1844), he is best known to foreigners, Galluppi traces his own philosophical development from the empiricism of the 18th century writers through the Kantian criticism to his final speculative view, one in many respects resembling the doctrines of the Scotch school as amended by Hamilton. His systematic work, Elementi di filosofia (4 vols. 1832), was long used as a textbook for instruction in the Italian colleges. Of other writings may be mentioned the Lezioni di logica e di metafisica (1832-3, 5 vols., 1842); the Filosofia della Volonta (3 vols., 1832-1842, incomplete); and the Storia della Filosofia (1842), of which only the first volume was published. Galluppi, though in many respects Kantian, can hardly be said to have taken up fully the speculative significance of the Critique of Pure Reason, He accepts the Kantian demonstration of the necessary unity of consciousness as the indispensable factor in knowledge, regards our knowledge of the ego as knowledge of substance, maintains that in external perception, or, as he puts it, in sensation, we are directly cognizant of the real thing, and holds that the existence of the unconditioned is given in knowledge as the necessary correlate of the conditioned, but rejects entirely the a priori element which is the distinguishing characteristic of the Kantian doctrine of cognition. All judgments, according to him, are ultimately identical—a relic of the empiricism of Condillac which is totally irreconcilable with the fundamental principles of his philosophy. On the other hand, Galluppi exaggerates the place and importance of the moral reason; with Kant he finds objective truth in the ideas of desert and duty, and admits that ethical judgments are a priori, without endeavouring to explain, in accordance with his theoretical views, how such judgments are at all possible.

A good view of Galluppi’s place in Italian philosophy is given in Ferri, Essai sur V Histoire de la Phil, en Italie au XlXvw Siècle, vol. i., Paris, 1869. See also V. Botta, in Ueberweg’s History of Phil. (Eng. transl., vol. ii., appendixii.); Prof. Barzellotti, “Philosophy in Italy,” in Mind, October 1878.
