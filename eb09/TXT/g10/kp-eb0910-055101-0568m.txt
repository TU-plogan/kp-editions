GERVAIS, Paul (1816-1879), an eminent paleontologist, was born September 26, 1816, at Paris, where he obtained the diplomas of doctor of science and of medicine, and in 1835, as assistant to De Blainville in the laboratory of comparative anatomy at the Museum of Natural History, commenced palaeontological research. In 1841 he obtained the chair of zoology and comparative anatomy at the Faculty of Sciences in Montpellier, of which he was in 1856 appointed dean. In 1848-52 appeared his important work Zoologie et Paléontologie Françaises, supplementary to the palaeontological publications of G. Cuvier and De Blainville; of this a second and greatly improved edition was issued in 1859. In 1865 he accepted the professorship of zoology at the Sorbonne, vacant through the death of Gratiolet; this post he left in 1868 for the chair of comparative anatomy at the Paris Museum of Natural History, the anatomical collections of which he greatly enriched by his exertions. He was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, in the place of Coste, January 26, 1874. Gervais was remarkable for the disinterestedness with which he devoted himself to the cause of science. He died February 10, 1879, in the sixty-third year of his age.
