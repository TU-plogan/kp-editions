GAMBOGE, the drug Cambogia, a gum-resin procured from Garcinia Morelia, Desrous., var. pedicellata, a dioecious tree with leathery, laurel-like leaves, small yellow flowers, and usually square-shaped and four-seeded fruit (see R. Jamie, Pharm. Journ., 3d ser., vol. iv. p. 802), a member of the natural order Guttifera , f and indigenous to Camboja (see Cambodia, vol. iv. p. 725), and parts of Siam and of the south of Cochin China, formerly comprised in Cambojan territory. The juice, which when hardened constitutes gamboge, is contained in the bark of the tree, chiefly in numerous ducts in its middle layer, and from this it is procured by making incisions, bamboo joints being placed to receive it as it exudes. Gamboge occurs in commerce in cylindrical pieces, known as pipe or roll gamboge, and also, usually of inferior quality, in cakes or amorphous masses. It is of a dirty orange exter nally; is hard and brittle, breaks with a conchoidal and reddish-yellow, glistening fracture, and affords a brilliant yellow powder; is odourless, and has a taste at first slight, but subsequently acrid; forms with water an emulsion; and consists of from 20 to 25 per cent, of gum soluble in water, and from 70 to 75 percent, of a resin, gambogic acid, soluble in alcohol and ether, and, according to Johnston, [9:10:61] of the formula C 20 H 23 O 4 , together with moisture about 5 per cent., and a trace of ligneous fibre. Its commonest adulterations are rice-flour and pulverized bark. Some quantity of gamboge is shipped from Kâmpot in Camboja, but the principal places of export are Bangkok in Siam, and Saigon in Cochin China. Gamboge is a powerful lιydra-gogue purgative, less drastic only than elaterium and croton ‘oil. Like aloes, it appears to exert its chief influence on the lower bowel {Brit, and For. Med.-Chir. Rev., i., 1853, p 128), and in combination with compound colocynth pill it has been recommended by Dr Symonds as one of the most efficient purgatives in torpor of the colon. The researches of Christison, Pabo, and Daraszkiewicz go to prove that gambogic acid alone is less cathartic than the same weight of gamboge; according to the last-mentioned experimenter and Schaur, the presence of bile in theintestincs is requisite for the development of its action. In cerebral affeetions, as apoplexy, when great debility is not present, gam&oge has proved to be a valuable counter-irritant purgative. It is sometimes employed as an anthelmintic, but appears to be devoid of any specific influence on entozoa. Some authorities regard it as decidedly diuretic in action. By Christison and others it has been found highly serviceable in dropsy. Abeille (quoted in Bmt. and For. Med.-Chir. Rev., 1853, ii. p. 279) administered it for that disease, in alcoholic solution, in divided doses of 6 grains per diem, increased by 2 grains daily, and given two hours prior or subsequent to meals. With the relief of the dropsy he observed that the patient’s toleration of these large quantities ceased. As gamboge is apt to occasion vomiting and griping, it is usually administered in combination with milder remedies. It is an ingredient of the pilulα cambogioe composita of pharmacy. In overdoses it acts as an acrid poison, provoking violent emesis and catharsis, and abdominal pain, coldness of the extremities, and ulceration and mortification of the intestines, eventuating in death. Gamboge is used as a pigment, and as a colouring matter for varnishes. It appeaι , 3 to have been first brought into Europe by merchants from the East, at the close of the 16th century. Bontius, writing in the year 1658, mentions it under the name of guttagemou, a word derived by Rost from the Malay gutdh, gum, and Javanese jαrnu, medicinal. By the Chinese gamboge (fang-hwang and shie-hwaηf) is understood to be “serpent-bezoar,” a substance vomited up by serpents, or the product of a species of ratan, analogous to the tabasheer of the bamboo (F. P. Smith, Contrib. towards the Mat. Med. . . of China, 1871). Varieties of gamboge are yielded by Garcinia Morelia, Desrous., a native of S. India and Ceylon, and by the Indian species G. pictoria, Roxb.,∙and G. travancorica, Beddome.
