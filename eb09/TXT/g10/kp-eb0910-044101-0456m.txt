GERARD, John (1545-1608), herbalist and surgeon, was born towards the end of 1545 at Nantwich in Cheshire. He was educated at Wisterson, or Willa t 3t0n, 2 miles from Nantwich, and eventually, after spending some time in travelling, took up his abode in London, where he exercised his profession. For more than twenty years he also acted as superintendent of the gardens of Lord Burghley, secretary of state to Queen Elizabeth. In 1596 he published a catalogue of plants cultivated in his own garden, 1039 in number, inclusive of varieties of the same species. Their English as well as their Latin names are given in a revised edition of the catalogue issued in 1599. In 1597 appeared Gerard’s well-known IIerball, described by him in its pre face as ’ ' the first fruits of these mine own labours,” but more truly an adaptation of the Stirpium historice pemptades of Rembert Dodoens, published in 1583, or rather of a translation of the whole or part of the same by Dr Priest, with L’Obel’s arrangement. Of the numerous illustrations of the IIerball sixteen appear to be original, the remainder are mostly impressions from the wood blocks employed by Jacob Theodorus (Tabernaemontanus) in his leones Stirpium, published at Frankfort in 1590. A second edition of the Rerball, with considerable improvements and additions, was brought out by Thomas Johnson in 1633, and reprinted in 1636. Gerard was elected a member of the court of assistants of the barber-surgeons in 1595, by which company he was appointed an examiner in 1598, junior warden in 1605, and master in 1608. He died in February 1612, and was buried at St Andrews, Holborn.
