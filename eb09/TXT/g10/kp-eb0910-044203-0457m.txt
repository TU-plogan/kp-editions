GERBERON, Gabriel (1628-1711), a Jansenist monk, one of the most diligent students and prolific writers of his century, was born August 12, 1628, at St Calais, in the department of Sarthe. At the age of twenty he took the vows of the Benedictine order at St Melaine, Rennes, and after having taught rhetoric and philosophy in the monasteries of Bourgueil (Touraine) and St Denis, he became sub-prior at Compiegne, whence he was afterwards removed to St Germain-des-Pres. In the year 1669 he fully and finally committed himself in the Jansenist controversy by the publication of his first work, which was an apology for the abbé Rupert of Tuits. In 1672 he was ordered to Argenteuil and in 1675 to Corbie; but having by this time aroused the most bitter hostility of the entire Jesuit order, he found it necessary to save himself by flight into the Low Countries, where he seems to have lived in various towns during the next twenty-eight years, and where he published a great number of works, including the Histoire Générale du Jansénisme (1700), by which he is now best known. Arrested on the 30th of May 1703 at Brussels, at the instance of the archbishop of Malines, he was sent into France aud condemned to imprisonment, from which he was not released till 1710, and even then only after he had consented to abjure the five Jansenist propositions. The first use he made of his freedom was to write a work (which, however, his friends prudently prevented him from publishing) Le vaine triomphe des Jésuites, containing a virtual withdrawal of the compulsory recantation. He died at the abbey of St Denis on the 29th of March 1711. A full list of his works is given in the Biographie Générale.
