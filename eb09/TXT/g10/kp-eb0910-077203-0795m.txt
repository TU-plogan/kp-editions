GONZAGA, Thomaz Antonio (1744-1809), “the Portuguese Petrarch,” perhaps better known as Dirceu, was born at Oporto in 1744, and received his early education there and at Bahia, where his father, after having held various judicial appointments, became a member of the supreme court in 1759. Having completed his law studies at the university of Coimbra, which he attended from 1763 to 1768, Gonzaga in the latter year returned to Brazil, and after having acted for some years as juiz de fora or local magis träte at Beja and elsewhere he ultimately was appointed a judge (ouvidor) at Villa-Rica in the province of Minas, where he highly distinguished himself it is said both by his administrative ability and by the many excellences of his private character. He appears before this time to have developed some talent for versification, and his literary tastes soon brought him into intimate association with Claudio Manoel, Alvarenga Peixoto, and other writers of the so-called Minas school; but the love which makes the poet did not, in his own opinion at least, come upon him until he had made the acquaintance (about 1788) of D. Maria Joaquina Dorothea de Seixas, the “Marilia de Dirceu” to whom all his extant poems relate. He had just been nominated a member of the supreme court of Bahia, and was on the eve of his marriage, when discovery was made of the treasonable plot of Minas, and he was arrested on suspicion of having been implicated in it. On merely circumstantial evidence, and that of a very incon clusive kind, he was condemned, 18th April 1792, to banishment for life to Pedras de Angoche, a sentence which was afterwards commuted to one of ten years’ exile at Mozambique. Here he made some effort to practise as an advocate, but he never recovered from the wearing-out depression into which he had been thrown by his cruel lot; an attack of nervous fever undermined his health, and after years of an ever-deepening melancholy, which occasionally alternated with fits of acute mania, he died in 1809. n

His collection of poems, entitled Mαrιliα de L)ireeu, consists of two parts. In the first of these, the charms of Marilia and his own happiness in the love he bears to her are his endlessly varied theme. The second, written during his imprisonment, is full of laments over his terrible fate, protestations of his innocence, and many fine expressions of the support and comfort he still finds in the remembrance of his love. Almost everywhere these “lyras” plainly enough betray a conscious imitation of Petrarch or other models; but they also exhibit an imaginative charm, a naturalness and delicacy of feeling, a harmoniousness of diction, and a gracefulness of versification which, in the unanimous opinion of competent critics, entitle them to rank among the best love lyrics in the language. In Brazil their popularity, perhaps aided by feelings of sympathy for their unfortunate author, has from the first been very great. The editions are very numerous, the best probably being that of J. Μ. P. da Sylva which is accompanied with an historical and biographical introduction (1845). A critical notice, along with selections from the poems of Gonzaga, will be found in Wolf’s Brésil Littéraire (1863). They have been translated into French by Monglave and Chalas (1825), into Spanish by Vedia, and into Italian by Ruscalla.
