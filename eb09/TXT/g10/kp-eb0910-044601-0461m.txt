GERMAN SILVER, or Nickel Silver, known also under the names of White Copper and Packfong, is an alloy of copper, nickel, and zinc, prepared either by melting the copper and nickel together in a crucible, and adding piece by piece the previously heated zinc, or by heating the finely divided metals under a layer of charcoal, by means of an air furnace of strong draught, and promoting the thorough solution of the nickel by stirring. To destroy its crystalline structure, and so render it fit for working, it is heated to dull redness, and then allowed to cool. German silver is harder than silver; it resembles that metal in colour, but is of a greyer tinge. Exposed to the air it tarnishes slightly yellow, and with vinegar affords a crust of verdigris. At a bright red heat it melts, and with access of the atmosphere loses its zinc by oxidation. At a heat above dull redness it becomes exceedingly brittle. German silver is much used in the arts. For the manufacture of imitation silver for knives and forks its composition is—nickel and zinc of each 2 parts, and copper 4 parts; for handles of spoons and forks the proportion of copper in this formula is increased by 1. For rolling, the most suitable alloy is copper 3 parts, zinc 1, nickel 1. Candlesticks, bells, spurs, and other cast articles are made of a German silver containing 2 or 3 per cent, of lead. The addition of 2 to 2¾ per cent, of iron, which must first be melted with part of the copper, makes an alloy which is whiter, but also more brittle and harder than ordinary German silver.
