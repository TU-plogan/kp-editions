GILBERT of Sempringham, St (c. 1083-1189), founder of the order of Gilbertines (Ordo Gilbertinorum Canonicorum, Ordo Sempringensis), was born about the year 1083 at Sempringham, Lincolnshire, where his father, Jocelyn de Sempringham, a Norman noble who had taken part in the Conquest, had settled. On the completion of a liberal education, received partly in England and partly in France, Gilbert was ordained a priest in 1123, having been presented by his father to the united livings of Sempringham and Tirington. About 1135 he established in the immediate vicinity of his parish church a religious house for the reception of some destitute girls; the rule he prescribed was substantially that of St Benedict, but the restrictions laid upon the communication of the inmates with the outer world were unusually severe. Subsequently the labourers who tilled the lands with which this establishment had been endowed were also formed into a religious community, under a rule resembling that of the Austin Friars, their house being placed close beside that of the nuns. Similar institutions elsewhere were encouraged by various English proprietors, and placed under the superintendence of Gilbert, who at last made application to Pope Eugenius III. to have them all merged in the Cistercian order (1148). This request, however, was refused, and Gilbert continued to act as superior of the monasteries he had founded for many years; although at the time of his death, on the 3d of February 1189, that dignity was held by Roger, one of his disciples. In 1189 the Gilbertines are said to have possessed thirteen monasteries, with almshouses, hospitals, and orphanages attached; and the community numbered in all upwards of 700 male and 1100 female members. At the time of their suppression the total number of Gilbertine houses in England and Wales had increased to about twenty-five. Gilbert, who had sided and suffered with the church in the quarrels between Henry II. and Thomas Ã  Becket, was canonized by Innocent III. in 1202; and his name is commemorated in the martyrologies on the 4th of February. The Gilbertinorum Statuta and a series of Exhortationes ad Fratres are attributed to him (see the Bollandist Acta Sanctorum, Feb. 4).
