GAYÄ, a district of British India in the Patnâ division, under the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, situated between 24° 1 7' and 25° 19' N. lat., and between 84° 4' and 86° 5' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Patnâ, on the E. by Monghyr, on the S.E. and S. by Hazâribâgh, and on the W. by Shâhâbâd districts. Generally speaking, Gayâ consists of a level plain, with a ridge of prettily wooded hills along the southern boundary, whence the country falls with a gentle slope towards the Ganges. Rocky hills occasionally occur, either detached or in groups, the loftiest being Mäher hill about 12 miles S.E. of Gayâ town, with an elevation of 1620 feet above sea-level. The eastern part of the district is highly cultivated; the portions to the north and west are less fertile; while in the south, the country is thinly peopled, and consists of hills, the jungles on which are full of wild animals. The principal river is the Son, which marks the boundary between Gayâ and Shâhâbâd, navigable by small boats throughout the year, and by craft of 20 tons burden in the rainy season. The other rivers are the Pimpùn, Phâlgù, and Jamnâ, and a number of smaller streams. Two branches of the Son canal system, the eastern main canal and the Patnâ canal, intersect the district.

The census of 1872 takes the area of Gayâ district at 4718 square miles, and returns the population at 954,129 males and 995,621 females,—total, 1,949,750, residing in 6530 villages or towns, and 327,845 houses. Classified according to religion, there are 1,729,890 Hindus, 219,332 [9:10:121] Mahometans, 203 Christians, and 316 “others.” Amongst the higher castes there is an unusually large proportion of Brâhmans, a circumstance due to the number of sacred places which the district contains. The Gayâwâls, or priests in charge of the holy places, are held in high esteem by the pilgrims; but they are not pure Brâhmans, and are looked down upon by those who are. They live an idle and dissolute life, but are very wealthy, from contributions extorted from the pilgrims. The ruined city of Buddh Gayâ, about 6 miles south of Gayâ town, marks the residence of Sakya Sinha, the founder of the Buddhist religion, who flourished in the 6th century B.C., and an ancient tree is pointed out as the identical fig tree under which the sage sat in abstraction for five years, until he attained to the state of Buddha. Another place of religious interest is a temple of great antiquity, which crowns the highest peak of the Baraber hills, and at which a religious fair is held each September, attended by from 10,000 to 20,000 pilgrims. At the foot of the hill are numerous rock caves excavated about 200 B.c,

Seven towns in Gaya district contain upwards of 5000 inhabitants, viz., Gaya, 66,843; Jahânâbâd, 21,022, Dâudnagar, 10,058; Tikâri, 8178; Sherghati, 7033; Hasua, 6119; and Rajauli, 5012. About four-fifths of the surface is cultivated. Rice forms the great agricultural staple, the area under cultivation being estimated at about 900,000 acres, yielding an outturn of over 400,000 tons. Wheat occupies about 170,000 acres, producing a crop of 60,000 tons, of which oneffialf is exported. Oil seeds are grown on about 35,000 acres, and opium on between 60,000 and 70,000 acres. Cotton, sugar-cane, chilies, and vegetables are also grown. Droughts are common, and in the famine of 1866 Gaya suffered severely. The scarcity of 1873-74 did not affect the district to any great extent. Manufactures consist of common brass utensils, black stone ornaments, pottery, tasar silk cloth. Formerly cloth-weaving and paper-making were important manufactures in the district, but these industries have now almost entirely died out. The chief exports are food grains, oil seeds, indigo, crude opium (sent to Patna for manufacture) , saltpetre, sugar, blankets, brass utensils, &c. The imports are salt, piece goods, cotton, timber, bamboos, tobacco, lac, iron, spices, and fruits. The principal trade route is along the Patna branch road. The total net revenue of the district in 1876-77 was £188,426, of which £136,692 was derived from the land; the net civil expenditure, £23,878. The district and municipal police of all ranks numbered 923, besides a rural force of 6790 men paid by the landholders and villagers. The number of schools in 1873-74 was 446, attended by 8139 pupils. The climate of Gayâ is dry and healthy,—the average annual temperature being about 80° F., and average annual rainfall 35 - 59 inches.

Gayâ, the chief town and administrative headquarters of the above district, situated on the bank of the Phâlgù river, Iat. 24° 47' 15" N., long. 85° 3' 10" E. The population in 1872 numbered 66,843 :—Hindus, 52,265; Mahometans, 14,444; Christians, 134. The municipal income in 1871 was £2716, and the expenditure £2351. The town consists of two distinct parts, adjoining each other; the part containing the residences of the priests is Gayâ proper; and the other, which is the business quarter, is called Sâhibganj. The civil offices and residences of the European inhabitants are situated here. Gayâ derives its sanctity from incidents in the life of Buddha connected with the adjoining district. But a local legend also exists concerning a pagan monster of great sanctity, named Gayâ, who wickedly tried to save sinners from deserved perdition. Brahma in order to get rid of Gayâ induced him to lie down in order that a feast might be held on his body; and once down, he placed a large stone on him to keep him there. The tricked demon struggled violently, and, in order to pacify him, Brahma promised that the gods should take up their permanent residence in him, and that any one who made a pilgrimage to the spot were he lay should be delivered from the terrors of the Hindu place of torment. This may possibly be a Brahmanic rendering of Buddha’s life and work. There are forty-five sacred spots in and around town, which are visited by from 100,000 to 200,000 pilgrims annually.
