GOA, a Portuguese settlement on the Malabar or western coast of India, lying between 15° 44' 30'' and 14 53' 30'' N. lat., and between 73° 45' and 74° 26 E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the river Tirakul or Auraundem, separating it from SAwant WAri State, on the E. by the Western GhAts, on the S. by Kanara district, and on the W. by the Arabian Sea. Total area, 1062 square miles; population, 392,234.

This settlement forms a patch of foreign territory on the east of the Bombay coast, and is surrounded on all sides, except to the seaward, by British districts. Goa is a hilly country, especially the recently acquired portion known as the Novas Conquistas. Its distinguishing feature is the Sahyadri Mountains, which after skirting a considerable portion of the north-eastern and south-eastern boundary, branch off westwards across the territory with numerous spurs and ridge3. The plains are well watered by large navigable rivers. The most important is the Mandavi river, on whose banks both the ancient and modern cities of Goa stand, with a fine harbour formed by the promontories of Bardez and Salsette. The port of New Goa or Panjim is divided into two anchorages by the projection of the cabo (cape) from the island of Goa, both capable of safely accommodating the largest shipping.

Goa ranks high as regards its early importance among the cities of western India. It emerges very distinctly in the 14th century, and was visited by the famous traveller Ibn Batuta. In the 15th century it formed the chief emporium of trade on the western side of India. Caravans of merchants brought down its products to the coast, and it was the only city in western India which enjoyed at this period a revenue of £10,000. Its wealth and advantageous situation attracted the Mahometan princes of the Deccan, and in 1469 it was taken by the BAhmani king. A fleet of 120 ships operated from the sea; the BAhmani troops forced their way down the passes of the Ghâts; and Goa capitulated. It next passed under the BijApur dynasty, and on the arrival of Albuquerque, at the beginning of the 16th century, its military and commercial capabilities at once struck his mind. In 1510 the fleet of Albuquerque, consisting of 20 sail of the line, with a few small vessels and 1200 fighting men, hove in sight off the harbour. A holy mendicant or joyi had lately foretold its conquest by a foreign people from a distant land, and the disheartened citizens rendered up the town to the strangers. Eight leading men presented the keys of the gates to Albuquerque on their knees, together with a large banner which was usually unfurled on state occasions. Mounted on a richly caparisoned steed, Albuquerque entered the city in a triumphal procession, with the Portuguese banners carried by the flower of the Lisbon nobility and clergy amidst the acclamations of an immense multitude, who showered upon the conqueror filigree flowers of silver and gold. Albuquerque behaved well to the inhabitants, but was shortly afterwards expelled by the BijApur king. However, he returned a few months later with a fleet of 28 ships carrying 1700 men, and after a bloody attack, in which 2000 Mussulmans fell, forced his way into the town. For three days the miserable citizens were subjected to every atrocity. The fifth part of the plunder, reserved for the Portuguese crown, amounted to £20,000.

The conquest of Goa illustrates the essentially military basis on which the Portuguese power in India rested. The subsequent history of the town has been one of luxury, ostentation, and decay. After bearing a siege by the king of Bijapur, and suffering from a terrible epidemic, Goa reached the summit of its prosperity at the end of the 16th century, during the very years when the English Company was struggling into existence under Elizabeth. “Goa Dourada,” or Golden Goa, seemed a place of fabulous wealth to the plain merchants who were destined to be the founders of British India. “Whoever has seen Goa need not see Lisbon,” said a proverb of that day. Indeed, if the accounts of travellers are to be trusted, Goa presented a scene of military, ecclesiastical, and commercial magnificence, such as has had no parallel in the European capitals of India. The brilliant pomp and picturesque display of Goa were due to the fact that it was not only a flourishing harbour, but the centre of a great military and ecclesiastical power. The Portuguese based their dominion in India on conquest by the sword. They laboured to consolidate it by a proselytizing organization which throws all other missionary efforts in India into the shade.

Goa reached its climax of pomp and power about the year 1600. Immediately afterwards commenced the long struggle with the Dutch, which before the end of the century had stripped Portugal of its fairest possessions in the East. In 1603 the Dutch blockaded Goa, but had to raise the siege. In 1635 the old epidemic fever which had afflicted Goa in the preceding century again broke out, and raged for five years. In 1639 the Dutch once more blockaded Goa, but found their meagre force of twelve ships insufficient for its capture. In 1666 luxury and the plague and the Dutch privateers had effectually crippled the commerce of Goa. Thevenot in that year drew a powerful picture of the decayed city. In 1675 Dr John Fryer described the city as in a ruinous state, whilst the inhabitants still made pitiful attempts at display in spite of their increasing misery. In 1683 Goa narrowly escaped falling into the hands of the Marhatta hordes under Sambâji. Before 1687 the abandonment of Old Goa had taken place. ‘‘ Many streets,” says an official document of that year, “have now become lonely and uninhabited.’’ The river had silted opposite its quays, ships could no longer approach the city, the fever had again broken out, and the population had moved out to suburbs nearer the mouth of the river. In 1695 only 20,000 inhabitants remained. In 1739 the whole territory was attacked by the Marhattas, and only saved by the unexpected appearance of a new viceroy with a fleet. Various attempts were made in vain to rebuild Old Goa, and by the middle of the 18th century “this fairest but poorest settlement had become a burden to the Portuguese Home Government, costing no less than 300,000 piastres a year.”

In 1759 further attempts to rebuild Old Goa were given up, and the governor changed Ins residence to Panjim or New Goa, the present city, at the mouth of the river. In 17/5 the population was reduced to about 1600 souls, of whom 1198 were Christians, almost entirely half-castes and native converts. In 1759 also the Jesuits were expelled. They had got into their hands what little commerce remained, and the last touch was put to the ruin of Old Goa. “The river washes the remains of a great city,—an arsenal in ruins, palaces in ruins, quay walls in ruins, churches in ruins,— all in ruins. We looked and saw the site of the Inquisition, the bishop’s prison, a grand cathedral, great churches, chapels, convents, religious houses, on knolls surrounded by jungle and trees [9:10:707] scattered all over the country. We saw the crumbling masonry which once marked the lines of streets and enclosures of palaces, dockyards filled with weeds and obsolete cranes.’’

Γanjim or New Goa lies in lat. 15° 30' N., long. 75° 53' E., at the mouth of the river Mandavi, and is a modern town with few pretensions to architectural beauty. Ships of the largest tonnage can lie out in the harbour, but only vessels of moderate size can be brought alongside of the city. The population is estimated at 15,000. Panjim was the residence of the viceroy from 1759, and in 1843 was ranked the capital of the Portuguese possessions in India.

The territory of Goa, including the two cities of Old Goa and Panjim with the adjoining country under Portuguese rule, amounts, as already stated, to 1062 square miles. Of the total population, namely, 392,234, nearly two-thirds or 232,089 are Roman Catholics, 128,824 are Hindus, and 2775 Mahometans. The Roman Catholics are subject in spiritual matters to an archbishop, who has the title of primate of the East. The Hindus and Mahometans enjoy perfect liberty in their religious affairs, and have their own places of worship. Agriculture forms the chief industry of the country. The total area under cultivation is 234,754 acres. Rice is the staple produce; next is the cocoa-nut, which is deemed important from the variety of uses to which the products are applied. The chief exports are cocoa-nuts, betel-nuts, mangoes, water-melons, cinnamon, pepper, salt fish, gum, firewood, and salt; and the chief imports rice, cloth, sugar, wines, tobacco, glassware, and hardware. The district seldom suffers from great floods. Some parts are subjected to inundations during heavy rains, but little damage is done to the crops. The high-lying town of Panjim takes its name from the native word Ponji, meaning “arable land that cannot be inundated.” The total revenue in 1873-74 was £108,148; the expenditure, £107,145. The police force numbers 919 men. In 1869-70 there were 137 lower schools, and 25 higher schools, including a National Lyceum with 2433 pupils. There are also medical and chemistry schools, and since 1870 a college for the study of practical sciences has been established. The prevailing endemic diseases are intermittent and remittent fevers, diarrhoea, and dysentery. The average annual rainfall for the three years ending 1875 was 100 - 22 inches.
