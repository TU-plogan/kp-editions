GILLESPIE, Thomas (1708-1774), one of the founders of the Scottish “Presbytery of Relief,” was born in the parish of Duddingston, Midlothian, in 1708. On the completion of his literary course at the university of Edinburgh, he for a short time attended a small theological seminary at Perth, and afterwards studied divinity under Dr Doddridge at Northampton, where he received ordination in January 1741. In August of the same year he was admitted minister of the parish of Carnock, Fife, the presbytery of Dunfermline agreeing, not only to sustain as valid the ordination he had received in England, but also to allow a qualification of his subscription to the church’s doctrinal symbol, so far as it had reference to the sphere of the civil magistrate in matters of religion. Having on conscientious grounds persistently absented himself from the meetings of presbytery held for the purpose of ordaining an unacceptable presentee as minister of Inverkeithing, he was, after an unobtrusive but useful ministry of ten years, deposed for contumacy by the Assembly of 1752; he continued, however, to preach, first at Carnock, and afterwards in Dunfermline, where a large congregation gathered round him; but it was not until 1761, and after repeated efforts to obtain readmission to the church, that, in conjunction with Boston of Jedburgh and Collier of Colinsburgh, he formed a distinct communion under the name of The Presbytery of Relief,—relief, that is to say, “from the yoke of patronage and the tyranny of the church courts.” He died on the 19th January 1774. His only literary efforts were an Essay on the Continuation of Immediate Revelations in the Church, and a Treatise on Temptation, characterized by considerable laboriousness and some ability. Both works appeared posthumously (1774). See Lives of Fathers of the United Presbyterian Church (Edin. 1849).
