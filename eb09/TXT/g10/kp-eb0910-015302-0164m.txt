GENLIS, Stéphanie-FélicitéDuckest de Saint-Aubin, Comtesse de (1746-1830), a voluminous French writer, was born of a noble but impoverished Burgundian family, at the Château de Champcery, near Autun, on the 25th of January 1746. When six years of age, she was received as a canoness into the noble chapter of Alix, near Lyons, with the title of Madame la Comtesse de Laney, taken from the town of Bourbon-Laney, of which her father was at that time superior. Her entire education, however, was conducted at home under the eye of her mother by an accomplished governess. In 1758 she removed along with her mother to Paris, where her skill in music and her vivacious wit speedily attracted attention and admiration. Her marriage with the Comte de Genlis, a colonel of grenadiers, who afterwards became marquis of Sillery, took place in her sixteenth year, but was not suffered to interfere with a rapidly developing taste for acquiring and imparting knowledge. Some years later, through the influence of her aunt, Madame de Montesson, who had been clandestinely married to the duke of Orleans, she entered the Palais Royal as lady-in-waiting to the duchess of Chartres (1770); and, after having acted with great energy and zeal as governess to the daughters of the family, she was in 1781 appointed by the duke to the responsible office of “gouverneur” of his sons, a bold step which, though it led to the resignation of all the tutors as well as to much social scandal, can hardly in fairness be held to have seriously prejudiced the intellectual interests at least of those committed to her charge. The better to carry out her theory of education, she wrote several works for the use of her royal pupils, the best known of which are the Théâtre <Γ Éducation (1779-80), a collection of short comedies for young people, and Les Annales de la Vertu (1781). When the Revolution of 1789 occurred, Madame de Genlis showed herself not unfavourable to the movement, and is said to have had considerable influence on the conduct of the duke of Orleans; but the fall of the Girondins in 1793 compelled her to take refuge in Switzerland along with her pupil Mademoiselle d’Orleans. It was in this year that her husband, the marquis of Sillery, from whom she had been separated since 1782, perished on the scaffold. An “adopted” daughter, Pamela Berkley or Simms, had been married to Lord Edward Fitzgerald in the preceding December (see Sir Bernard Burke’s Pise of Great Families, 1872). In 1794 Madame de Genlis fixed her residence at Berlin, but having been expelled by the orders of King Frederick William, she afterwards settled in Hamburg, where she supported herself for some years by writing and painting. After the revolution of 18th Brumaire (1799) she was permitted to return to France, and was received with favour by Napoleon, who gave her apartments at the arsenal, and afterwards assigned her a pension of 6000 francs. During this period she wrote largely, and produced what is generally considered to be her best romance, entitled Mademoiselle de Clermont. At the restoration she succeeded in adjusting herself once more to the new state of things, and continued to write with all her former diligence. Her later years were occupied largely with literary quarrels, notably with that which arose out of the publication of the Dîners du Baron <T Holbach, a volume in which she set forth with a good deal of sarcastic cleverness the intolerance, the fanaticism, and the eccentricities of the “philosophes” of the 18th century. Madame de Genlis before her death, which occurred on the 31st of December 1830, had the satisfaction of seeing her former pupil, Louie Philippe, seated on the throne of France.

The numerous works of Madame de Genlis (which considerably exceed eighty), comprising prose and poetical compositions on a vast variety of subjects and of various degrees of merit, owed much of their success to adventitious causes which have long ceased to operate, and they are now but little read. The swiftness with which they were written, their very multiplicity, and their diffuseness, all forbid us to look in them for thought of perennial value or literary art of any high order. They are useful, however (especially the voluminous Mémoires), as furnishing material for history; and she herself can hardly pass altogether unnoticed in the crowd which thronged the stage of public life in the confused and busy time of the French Revolution. Most of her writings were translated into English almost as soon as they were published.
