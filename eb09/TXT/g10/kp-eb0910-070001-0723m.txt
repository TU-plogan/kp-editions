GMELIN, Samuel Gottlieb (1743-1774), an eminent naturalist, nephew of J. G. Gιnelin (see above), was born at Tübingen, June 23, 1743. He graduated there as M.D. in 17G3, went to St Petersburg in 1767, and in 1768, with Pallas, Güldenstädt, and Lapuchin, commenced a journey for the scientific exploration of the south-east possessions of Russia. Having visited in succession the western districts of the Don, the Persian provinces to the south and southwest of the Caspian Sea, the regions of the Volga, and the eastern borders of the Caspian, he in 1774 was on his way back to St Petersburg when he was seized as a hostage by Usmey Khan, of the Kaitak tribe, through whose ill-treatment he died on July 27th of the same year.

His principal works are Historia Fucorum iconibus illustrata (St Petersburg, 1768), and Voyages dans differentes parties des 1 Empire de Russie (4 vols. 4to, St Petersburg, 1770-84).
