GARCIA, Manoel (1775-1832), or, in full, Manoel Garcia del Popolo Vicente, was born in 1775 at Seville. He began artistic life as chorister at the cathedral of Seville, and simultaneously studied music under the best masters of his native city. At the age of seventeen he made his début on the stage at Cadiz, in an operetta of his own composition. Soon afterwards he appeared at Madrid in his twofold capacity of singer and composer. His reputation being thus established, he proceeded to Paris, where he appeared for the first time, in 1808, in Paer’s opera Griselda. Here also he was received with great applause, his style of singing being especially appreciated. This he further improved by careful study of the Italian method in Italy itself, where he continued his successes. His opera, The Caliph of Bagdad, was favourably received at Naples in 1812, but his chief successes were again due to his perfection as a vocalist. In 1824 he went to London, and thence proceeded to America (1825) with a company of excellent artists, amongst whom were his son Manoel and his daughter Maria, better known under her subsequent name of Malibran. He extended his artistic tour as far as Mexico, and was on the point of returning to Europe in order to retire from public life, when he was robbed of his well-earned wealth by brigands on his way to Vera Cruz. Settled again in Paris he soon retired from the stage, and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. He died in 1832. His method of teaching was unsurpassed, and some of the most celebrated singers of the early part of the century were amongst his pupils. He also wrote an excellent book on the art of singing called Metodo di canto. Amongst his pupils were his children (already mentioned), who, as well as his daughter Paulina, worthily continued his name in the musical world.
