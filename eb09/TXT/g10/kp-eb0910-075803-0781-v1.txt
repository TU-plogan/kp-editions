GOLDEN ROSE (rosa aurea), an ornament, made of wrought gold and set with gems, which is blessed by the pope on the fourth (Laetare) Sunday of Lent, and usually afterwards sent as a mark of special favour to some distinguished individual, church, or civil community. The ceremonies which at present accompany the consecration of a golden rose are of a somewhat elaborate character, and are explained by liturgists as designed to make it specially emblematic of Christ and of the Christian gracee. Some difficulty is experienced in tracing them to their ultimate origin; but the custom of blessing and sending some symbol of the kind seems to be as old at least as the time of Gregory the Great, with whom it was a frequent practice to send persons whom he wished to flatter a few particles filed from “Peter’s chains,” and set in keys or crosses of gold (Greg., Op. ii. G48, 711, 796, 1031, ed. 1705). This practice continued to be observed for several centuries; thus we find Gregory VII., in 1079, writing to Alphonso of Castile, “Ex more sanctorum misimus vobis claviculam auream in qua de catenis beati Petri benedictio continetur” (Mansi, Cone. Gen., xii. 460). The first mention of the “golden rose,” as such, is said to occur in the 11th century; and an allusion to it is certainly made in the Chronicle of William of Newburgh (1197). Pope Urban V., who sent a golden rose to Joanna of Naples in 1366, is alleged to have been the first to determine that the consecration should be annually observed. Among the very numerous recipients of this honour have been Henry VIII. of England, the famous Gonsalvo de Cordova, and, in more recent times, Napoleon III. of France and Isabella II. of Spain. The gift of the golden rose used almost invariably to accompany the coronation of the king of the Romans. If in any particular year no one is considered worthy of the rose, it is laid up in the Vatican.
