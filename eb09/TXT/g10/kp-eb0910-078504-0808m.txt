GÖRLITZ, a town in the Prussian province of Silesia, capital of a circle in the government district of Liegnitz, is situated on the left bank of the Neisse, and at the junction point of several railways, 55 miles east of Dresden. The Neisse at this point is crossed by a railway bridge half a mile long and 120 feet high, with 32 arches. The town is the seat of a provincial office, a circle court, and a chamber of commerce. It is surrounded by beautiful walks and fine gardens, and although its old walls and towers have now been demolished, many of its ancient buildings remain to form a picturesque contrast with the signs of modern industry. From the hill called Landskrone, about 1500 feet high, an extensive prospect is obtained of the surrounding country. The principal buildings are the fine church of St Peter and St Paul, dating from the 15th century, with a famous organ and a very heavy bell; the church of Our Lady erected about the end of the 15th century, and possessing a fine portal and choir in pierced work; the Catholic church, founded in 1853, inlhe Roman style of architecture, with beautiful glass windows and oil-paintings; the town house, containing the arms of King Matthias of Hungary, and having at its entrance a fine flight of steps; the old bastion, named Kaisertrutz, now used as a guardhouse and armoury; the gymnasium buildings in the Gothic style erected in 1851; the fine new middle school, the real school, the provincial trade school, the theatre, and the barracks. Near the town is the chapel of the Holy Cross, in connexion with which there is a model of the Holy Grave at Jerusalem. In the public park there [9:10:786] is a bust of Schiller and a monument to Alexander von Humboldt; and a monument has also been erected in the town in commemoration of the war of 1870-71. In connexion with the National History Society there is a valuable museum, and the Scientific Institute possesses a large library and a rich collection of antiquities, coins, and articles of vertu. Görlitz, next to Breslau, is the largest and most flourishing commercial town of Silesia. Besides cloth, which forms its staple article, it has manufactories of various linen and woollen wares, machines, railway waggons, sago, tobacco, leather, chemicals, and tiles.

Gorlitz existed as a village from a very early period, and at the beginning of the 12th century it was made a borough by Duke Sobieslaus I. of Bohemia. It was then known as Drebenau, but on being rebuilt after its destruction by fire in 1131 it received the name of Zgorzelice (burnt town). About the end of the 12th century it was strongly fortified, and in 1346 it joined the league of the six towns. It was several times besieged and taken during the Thirty Years’ War, and it also suffered considerably in the Seven Years’ War. In the battle which took place near it between the Austrians and Prussians, 7th September 1757, Winterfield, the general of Frederick the Great, was slain. In 1815 the town, with the greater part of Upper Lusatia, came into the possession of Prussia. The population in 1831 was only about 8000, but in 1849 it had increased to 19,032, and in 1875 it was 45,310.
