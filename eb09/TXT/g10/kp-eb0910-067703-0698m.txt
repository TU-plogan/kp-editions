GLEIM, Johaxn Wilhelm Ludwig (1719-1803), a minor German poet, was born April 2, 1719, near Halberstadt, and died there February 18, 1803, after having occupied, during half a century, the situation of secretary to the chapter of Halberstadt. “Father Gleim” was the title accorded to him throughout all literary Germany on. account of his kind-hearted though inconsiderate and undiscriminating patronage alike of the poets and poetasters of the period. He wrote a large number of feeble imitations of Anacreon, Horace, and the minnesingers, a dull didactic poem entitled Halladat oder das rothe Buch (Halberstadt, 1774, 4th ed. 1812), and collections of fables and romances {Fabeln, Berlin, 1756-57; Romanzen, Berlin and Leipsic, 1756; Lieder, Fabeln, und Romanzen, Berlin, 1758). Of higher merit are his Preussische Kriegsliedereines Grenadiers (Berlin, 1758). These, which were inspired by the campaigns of Friederick II., is often distinguished by genuine feeling and vigorous force of expression. They are also noteworthy as being the first of that long series of noble political songs in which later German literature·is so rich. With this exception, Gleim’s writings are for the most part tamely commonplace in thought and expression. His very best odes have only a certain feeble prettiness to recommend them. A few, as Das Hüttchen and An LeuL·on, have still some popularity, and appear in most collections of German poetry.
