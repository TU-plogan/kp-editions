GELA, an ancient city on the south coast of Sicily, on a river of the same name, near the site of the modern Terranuova between Girgenti and Camerina. Founded by a joint colony of Cretans and Rhodians (the latter mainly from the city of Lindus), it soon rose to wealth and power, and by 582 b.c. it was able to become the mother-city of Agrigentum, by which it was however destined before long to be surpassed. The most important among its rulers were the fol.owing :â€”Cleander, who subverted the oligarchy and made himself despot (505-498 b.c.) ; Hippocrates, his brother, who raised Gela to its highest pitch of eminence (498-491 b.c.); Gelon, who immediately succeeded Hippocrates, and rapidly pursued the same career of aggrandizement till in 485 b.c. he got possession of Syracuse, and gave the first blow to his native city by removing the seat of government to his new conquest; and finally Hiero, the brother of Gelon, who succeeded to the sovereignty in 478 b.c. The decadent Gela was laid waste by Phalaris of Agrigentum, and in the time of Strabo it was nothing more than a heap of ruins. Aeschylus died at Gela iu 456 b.c.; and it was the birthplace of Apollodorus, a comic poet of note.
