GERBERT, Martin (1720-1793), a Catholic prelate and writer on church music, was a descendant of the Ger-berts of Hornau, and was born at Horb on the Neckar, Wurtemberg, 12th August 1720. He received his education at the Jewish school of Freiburg in the Breisgau, at Klingenau in Switzerland, and at the monastery of St Blaise in the Black Forest. He joined the order of the Benedictines in the monastery of St Blaise in 1736, became priest in 1744, was soon thereafter appointed professor of theology, and was chosen abbot in 1764. From 1759 to 1762 he travelled in Germany, Italy, and France, chiefly with the view of obtaining access to the old collections of musical literature contained in the libraries of the monasteries. In 1774 he published two volumes De cantu et musica sacra ; in 1777, Monumenta veteris liturgioe Alemannicoe; and in 1784, in three volumes, Scriptores ecclesiastici de musica sacra, a collection of the principal writers on church music from the 3d century till the invention of printing. Although this work contains many textual errors, its publication has nevertheless been of very great importance for the history of music, by preserving writings which otherwise might either have perished or remained unknown. He is also the author of Codex epistolaris Rudolphi I., 1772, and Historia Nigrae Silvae, Cologne, 1783-1788. His interest in music led to his acquaintance with the composer Gluck, who became his intimate friend. He died 3d May 1793.
