GEESTEMÃœNDE, a seaport in the Prussian province of Hanover, in the district or Landdrostei of Stade, situated, as the name indicates, at the mouth of the Geeste, a right-hand affluent of the estuary of the Weser. It lies about 32 miles N. of Bremen, and is the terminus of a railway from that city. The interest of the place is purely naval and commercial, its origin dating no further back than 1857, when the construction of the harbour was commenced. The great basin opened in 1863 has a length of 1785 English feet, a breadth of 410, and a depth of nearly 23, and can accommodate 24 or 25 of the largest ships of the line; and the petroleum basin opened in 1874 has a length of 820 feet and a breadth of 147. To the left of the great basin lies a canal, which has a length of 13,380 feet and a breadth of 155; and from this canal there strikes off another of similar proportions. The whole port is protected by powerful fortifications, and it lies outside of the limit of the German customs. Since 1864 the trade has been almost trebled, the number of vessels being 617 sea-going ships entering in 1875 and upwards of 2000 river craft. Among the industrial establishments of the town are shipbuilding yards, foundries, engineering works, and steam mills. The population, exclusive of the garrison, was 3218 in 1871, and 3436 in 1875; and if the neighbouring commune of Geestendorf be included, the total for 1871 was 9148, and for 1875 10,425.
