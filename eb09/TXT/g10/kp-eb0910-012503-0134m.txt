GAZETTE, The London, is the official newspaper of the Government, and is published every Tuesday and Friday. It contains proclamations, orders, regulations, and other acts of state, and is received as evidence thereof in legal proceedings. It also contains notices of proceedings in bankruptcy, dissolutions of partnership, &c. The Bankruptcy Act, 1869, requires the order of adjudication to be published in the Gazette, and makes the Gazette conclusive evidence of adjudication. Other statutes, dealing with special subjects, have similar provisions. Unless by virtue of such statutes, the Gazette is not evidence of anything but acts of state. The Scotch law of evidence would appear not to be so stringent. Gazettes are also published in Edinburgh and Dublin.
