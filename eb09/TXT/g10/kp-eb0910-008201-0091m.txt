GARNIER, Germain (1754-1821), an able writer on political economy, was born at Auxerre, on 8th November 1754. He was educated for the law, and obtained when young the office of procureur at Châtelet. He acted for some time as secretary to Mme. Adelaide, aunt of Louis XVI., and by his fine presence and manners acquired considerable reputation and power at court. On the calling of the states-general he was named as deputy for Châtelet, and in 1790 he appears to have been a member of the monarchical club in Paris. After 1792 he withdrew to the Pays de Vaud, and did not return till 1795. In public life, however, he seems to have been singularly fortunate. In 1797 he was on the list of candidates for the Directory; in 1800 he was prefect of Seine et Oise; in 1804 he was made senator; and from 1809 to 1811 he acted as president of the senate. After the restoration he obtained a peerage, and on the return of Louis XVIII., after the Hundred Days, he became minister of state and member of privy council. He died at Paris, 4th October 1821. Garnier was somewhat advanced in years before he began to take any interest in political economy; his previous efforts in literature had been of an altogether different kind. At court he was, when young, noted for his facile power of verse-writing, and he translated Mrs Radcliffe and Mrs Montague.

Garnier is best known by his admirable translation, with notes and introduction, of Smith’s Wealth of Nations (1st ed 1805, 2d ed. 1822), and by his Histoire de la Monnaie (2 vols., 1819), which contains much sound and well-arranged material. His Abrégé des Principes de l’Écon. Polit. (1796) is a very clear and instructive manual. Of high value also is the Description géographique, physique, et politique du départe ment de Seine-et-Oise (1822), drawn up from his instructions. Other works are De la Propriété (1792), and Histoire des Banques d'Escompte (1806).
