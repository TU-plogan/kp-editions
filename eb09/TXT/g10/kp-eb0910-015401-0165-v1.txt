GENOA, in literary Italian Genova, in the local dialect Zene, in Latin and German Genua, in mediaeval Latin Janua, and in French Genes, one of the most important cities of Italy, is situated in what was formerly known as Liguria, on the northern coast of the Mediterranean near the middle of the Gulf of Genoa. The latitude of its lighthouse is 44° 24' 16" N., and its longitude 8° 54' 15" E. By rail Genoa is 115 English miles N.E. of Nice and 119 miles N.W. of Leghorn. The city, as seen from the sea, is “built nobly,” and deserves the title it has acquired or assumed of the Superb. Finding only a small space of level ground along the shore, it has been obliged to climb the lower hills of the Ligurian Alps, which afford many a coign of vantage for the effective display of its architectural magnificence. The original nucleus of the city is that portion which lies to the east of the port in the neighbourhood of the old pier (Molo Vecchio).’ In the 1Oth century it began to feel a lack of room within the limits of its fortifications; and accordingly, in the middle of the 12th century, it was found necessary to extend the line of circumvallation. Even this second circuit, however, was of small compass, and it was not till 1320-30 that a third line took in the greater part of the modern site of the city proper. This presented about 3 miles of rampart towards the land side, and can still be easily traced from point to point through the city, though large portions, especially towards the east, have been dismantled. The present line of circumvallation dates from 1626-1632, the period when the independence of Genoa was threatened by the dukes of Savoy. From the mouth of the Bisagno in the east, and from the lighthouse point in the west, it stretches inland over hill and dale to the great fort of Sperone, i.e., the Spur, on the summits of Monte Peraldo at a height of 1650 feet,—the circuit being little less than 12 miles, and all the important points along the line being defended by forts or batteries. Of course a large portion of the enclosed area is open country, dotted only here and there with houses and gardens. There are eight gates in all,—the more important being PortaPila and Porta Romana towards the east, and the new Porta Lanterna or Lighthouse Gate to the west.

The irregular relief of its site, and its long confinement within the limit of fortifications which it had outgrown, have both contributed to render Genoa a picturesque confusion of narrow streets, lanes, and alleys, which it would almost require the delicate diminutives of Italian to name, varied with stairways climbing the steeper slopes, and bridges spanning the deeper valleys. As there are large portions of the town which are quite inaccessible to ordinary carriages, and many even of the more important streetshave very little room for traffic, porters and chairs take to a considerable extent the place of cabs, and goods are largely transported by means of mules. In the middle of the 16th century the Government gave commencement to a system of more spacious thoroughfares than had previously been in vogue by laying out the street which still bears the name of Via Nuova; in 1606 the Via Balbi, as it was ultimately called from the palaces of the Balbi family, began to stretch westwards; and at length, about 1778, a connexion between these two streets was effected by the opening up of Via Nuovissima. The line thus produced, extending as it does from the Piazza Fontane Morose westward for about a mile to the Piazza Verde is still the route most in favouι∙ with the fashionable world of Genoa. As early as the middle of the 17th century the Via Giulia was driven through the midst of the small streets between the ducal palace and the Porta d’Arco; but it was not till about 1825 that the Via Carlo Felice gave free route between the palace and the Piazza Fontane Morose. The Via Lorenzo and the long line of street which, under the names of Carlo Alberto, S. Benedetto, and Milano, runs round the port to its western extremity, also belong to this century. The spacious Via Roma, running east from Via Carlo Felice to meet the Via Assarotti, has been built since 1870; and the area of the Piazza Cavour was only about the same time cleared of the old houses. The great public promenade of Acquasola already mentioned was laid out by the architect Carlo Barabino between 1821 and 1837; and it has been connected with the gardens of the Villetta di Negri, purchased by the municipality about 1865.

Of the churches of Genoa, which number upwards of eighty, the principal is the cathedral of St Laurence (il duomo di San Lorenzo). Tradition makes its first foundation contemporary with St Laurence himself; there is distinct historic mention of a church on the site in the latter part of the 9th century; and a document of 987 implies that it was even then the metropolitan church. Reconstructed about the end of the 11 th and beginning of the 12th century, it was formally consecrated by Pope Gelasius II., 18th October 1118; and since then it has undergone a large number of extensive though partial renovations. In the façade the lower part, with its three elaborate doorways in the Gothicυ-Moorisħ style, dates from the 12th century; the upper part belongs to the 14th; and, the belfry which rises above the right-hand doorway was erected about 1520 by the doge, Ottaviano da Campo-fragoso. To the 13th century is assigned the central nave, which was, however, both lengthened and heightened in the 14th; and the cupola was erected after the designs of the architect Galeasso Alessi invited to Genoa about 1550. Among the artists who have contributed to the internal decoration the most noteworthy are Damiano of Bergamo, who represented the Slaughter of the Innocents and the Martyrdom of St Laurence in the woodwork of the choir; Lazzaro Tavarone, who painted the roof about 1622; G. B. Bianco, who furnished the bronze statue of the Madonna of the city in 1652; [9:10:155] Gian Giacomo della Porta, the sculptor of the statues of Mark and Luke in the presbyterium; and Giovanni Maria Pas3al0 and Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli, the sculptors of the corresponding statues of Matthew and John. The stained glass windows of the choir, representing the four patron saints of the city, are the work of Giovanni Bertini. To none of the chapels in the cathedral, rich as several of them are in works of artistic value, can a higher rank be assigned than to the chapel of St John the Baptist. The main design, with its elaborate detail of columns and arabesques, and foliage and statues, was due to Pio Domenico da Bissone, who from 1450 was engaged for ten years on the work. Statues by Matteo Civitali of Lucca and Andrea Contucci of Monte San Savino, a rich and costly baldachin presented by Count Filippino Doria, and stained glass windows designed by Ulisse de’ Mattei, are among the later additions to its decoration. On one day only in the course of the year are women allowed to enter the chapel; for was it not a woman who procured the death of the Baptist? Amid the profusion of ecclesiastical bric-a-brac in the nooks and niches of the cathedral, there are objects enough of considerable interest. Here, bound together by craft of goldsmith, is an octagonal bowl, brought from Caesarea in 1101, which corresponds to the descriptions given of the Holy Grail, and was long regarded as an emerald of matchless price, but which turned out, when broken by its French purloinere, to be only a remarkable piece of ancient glass.

Of older date than the cathedral is the church of St Ambrose and St Peter, if its first foundation be correctly assigned to the Milanese bishop Honoratus of the 6th century; but the present edifice is due to the Society of Jesus, who obtained possession of the church in 1587, and employed the skill of Pellegrino Tebaldi in its restoration. Among the paintings of this church the first place is naturally given to the Circumcision and St Ignatius by Rubens, and to the Assumption of Guido Reni. The Annunziata del Guastato is one of the largest and wealthiest churches in the city. It owes its first foundation to the order of the Humiliati, but S. Marta, as it was originally called, was a small building till it passed about 1505 into the hands of the Conventuals of St Francis, by whom the present gigantic structure was planned and partly erected. The rest of the main edifice was due to the Observartines of the same order, who came into possession in 1537, and gave the church its modern name; and the necessary funds were largely supplied by the Lomellini family. The church is a cruciform structure, with a dome, and the central nave is supported by fourteen columns in the Corinthian style. To the unfinished brick façade an incongruous portal with marble columns was added about 1843, after the plans of Carlo Barabino. Santa Maria delie Vigne probably dates from the 9th century, but the present structure was erected towards the close of the 16th. The campanile, however, is a remarkable work of the 13th century. San Siro, originally the “Church of the Apostles” and the cathedral of Genoa, was rebuilt by the Benedictines in the 11th century, and restored and enlarged by the Theatines in the 16th. Santa Maria di Carignano, or more correctly Santa Maria Assunta e SS. Fabiano e Sebastiano, belongs mainly to the 16tħ century, and was designed by Galeazzo Alessi, in imitation of Bramante’s plan for St Peter’s at Rome. The expense was borne by the Sauli family. From the highest gallery of the dome—368 feet above the sea-level, and 194 feet above the ground—a magnificent view is obtained of the city and the neighbouring coast. S. Stefano dates from 969, and keeps its ancient campanile, but it has been [9:10:156] several times rebuilt. Tiιe famous painting of the martyrdom of St Stephen, by Giulio Romano, carried off by Napoleon in 1811, was restored to the church in 1815. The Madalena, as it now stands, was built by Andrea Vannone about the close of the 16th century; and San Filippo Neri was rebuilt in the close of the 17th century at the expense of the Pallavicini family. S. Matteo, the church of the D’Oria or Doria family, was founded in 1126 by Martino Doria, and the present edifice, after the designs of Montorsoli, dates from 1543. In the crypt is the tomb of Andrea Doria the Great by the same Montorsoli, and above the main altar hangs the dagger presented to the doge by Pope Paul III.

The palaces of the Genoese patricians are famous for their sumptuous architecture and their artistic collections. The Palazzo Rosso, or Red Palace, erected in the middle of the 17th century, was in 1874 presented to the city by Maria, the wife of Raffaele de Ferrari, duke of Galliera, and her son Filippo de Ferrari, along with its library and picture gallery. The old palace of the doges, now the seat of the prefecture, was rebuilt in the 16th century, and again restored after a great fire in 1777; the neighbouring tower, from which the magistrates were summoned by toll of bell, dates from the beginning of the 14th century. A sixteenth century palace, formerly the property of the dukes of Turin, is now occupied by the municipality, and contains among its more curious treasures a bronze tablet (117 a.d.), with an inscription relating to a dispute between Genoa and a neighbouring castle, two autograph letters of Columbus, and Paganini’s violin. The inscription, discovered in 1506, was printed for the first time in 1520 by Brucelli, whose works form part of Graevius’s Thesaurus, and among its modern commentators are Serra in the Transactions of the Imperial Academy of Genoa, and Simoni and Grassi in the Transactions of the Ligurian Society of Native History. The palace which was presented in 1528 by the republic to Andrea Doria is a large building of the 15th century, restored and extended under the doge’s direction, and decorated with frescos by Perino del Vaga. The royal palace, built in the middle of the 16th century for the Durazzo family, was acquired by Victor Emmanuel in 1817. Among other buildings of the same class, the Durazzo palaces in the Via Nuovissima, and the Via Balbi, the Balbi Senarega in the Via Balbi, the Sarra palace in the Via Nuova, and the Pallavicino in the Piazza Fontane Morose are worthy of note.

Of most historical interest among the benevolent institutions of Genoa is the hospital of Pammatone (Ospedale civile di Pammatone), a vast edifice contiguous to the public park of Acquasola. It owes its origin to the bequest in 1429 of Bartolommeo Bosco; and the excellence of the infirmary thus established caused the citizens to procure permission from Sixtus V. to divert the funds of all similar minor foundations to its support. New buildings were erected in 1626 by Giacomo Saluzzo, and still larger additions were made in 1758, under the superintendence of Andrea Orsolino. Under the same committee with the general hospital is the hospital for incurables (Ospedale dei Cronici, originally Ridotto degli Incurabili), instituted towards the end of the 15th century by Ettore Vernazza, and taken under the direct control of the civil authorities in 1500. The great poorhouse (Albergo dei Poveri), dating from about 1665, is a vast building, after designs by Stefano Scaniglia, covering no less than 215,280 square feet, and accommodating 1400 inmates, who manufacture cotton and woollen cloth, furniture, embroidery, &c. The so-called Conservatorio delle Fieschine was founded in 1763, in accordance with the will of Domenico Fieschi, as an asylum for destitute girls; and in 1783 his widow left 80,000 lire to provide a dowry of 500 lire for any of the inmates leaving the institution to be married or to take the veil. A considerable reputation has been acquired by the flower-makers of this institution.

The sums bequeathed for charitable purposes during 1863-75 amounted to 3,798,106 francs, in addition to the immense donations (about thirty millions of francs) of the deceased duke of Galliera.

The highest educational institution in Genoa is the royal university, which occupies a palace in the Via Balbi, originally built about 1623 for the Jesuit fathers entnιsted by the magistrates with the supervision of education in 1572. The republic had received the right of conferring degrees from Pope Sixtus IV. as early as 1471, a privilege confirmed by the emperor Maximilian I. in 1496. On the dissolution of the Jesuits the administration of the college passed into the hands of the republic, and the provisional Government of 1797 reinaugurated it as a university in 1803. In 1808, during the French occupation, it was assimilated to the other imperial academies, so that its present organization may be said to date only from 1812. It numbers about 400 students, who have the advantage of a physical and a natural history museum, an anatomical cabinet, a meteorological observatory, a botanical garden, and a library. The library, originated by the Jesuits, numbers about 80,000 volumes, among which none is considered of greater value by the Genoese than the manuscript collection of the laws and enactments of their republic, Liber jιιrium communis Jαnucnsis. In Genoa, as elsewhere in Italy, great advance has been made both in secondary and primary education since 1867: in 1877 the city possessed two gymnasiums, a lyceum named after Christopher Columbus, three technical schools, a high school for female education opened by the municipality in 1874, a female normal school dating from 1859, a teachers’ training school founded in 1861, and upwards of 40 infant schools (Asili d’ Infanzia), of which the first was opened in 1840. The royal technical institute comprises three distinct sections—a professional industrial institute, an institute of mercantile marine, and a system of evening classes in mathematics, chemistry, mechanics, &c.; and a royal naval college was opened in 1873. The Ligurian academy of the fine arts owed its origin in 1751 to Francesco Maria Doria, and the p>ala~zo in which its museums and galleries are situated was erected in 1831 by Carlo Barabino. A musical institute, founded by Antonio Costa and maintained by the municipality, has rooms in the convent of St Philip Neri. A society for the promotion of the fine arts dates from 1849, the Ligurian society of native history from 1857, and a society for the arts and industries of Liguria from 1871. Besides the university library there are four public libraries—the Biblioteca Civico-Berian a (40,000), presented to the municipality by Victor Emmanuel I., to whom it had been bequeathed; the Biblioteca della Missione Urbana (40,000), a noble collection rich in manuscripts of Ligurian history and Greek codices, which owes its origin to the legacy of Gerolamo Franzone in 1727; the Biblioteca Franzoniana (12,000), due to the same G. Franzone. and administered by the congregation of “Evangelical Workmen”; and, lastly, the fine library which forms part of the great legacy in the Palazzo Rosso. A museum of natural history (Museo Civico di St. Nat.), opened in the Villetta di Negro in 1873, is worthy of special note for the collections made by Giacomo Doria, Beccari, D’Albertis, and Antinori. Picture galleries are to be found in many of the ancient palaces, and in two at least, the Palazzo Rosso and the Palazzo Bianco, the collections are of great value. An excellent law forbids the removal from the city or province of any object of ancient art without the sanction of a commission under the presidency of the prefect. In 1877 the Genoese had a choice of about a dozen theatres, small and great, inclusive of those in Sampierdarena. Of these the greatest is the Carlo Felice, erected in 1826-28 under the patronage of the king whose name it bears. The National Theatre, rebuilt in 1790, dates originally from 1702, and it has an older rival in the Teatro del Falcone, which is associated with the life of Goldoni, and now serves as court theatre.

The mountainous character of the surrounding country has rendered it a difficult task to supply Genoa with sufficient means of railway communication; in the 20 miles, for example, between the city and Arquata there are eleven tunnels, that of Giovi being upwards of 2 miles long. The line to the north through the valley of the Polcevera, which joins the general Italian system at Alessandria, was opened about 1853; but it was not till 1870 that the western line was completed so as to give a continuous route from France, and it was November 1874 before the eastern section between Sestri di Levante and Spezia established a connexion with the lines along the western coast of Italy. Since that date, however, passengers and goods can be conveyed by rail from Calais to Otranto. There are two stations in the city,—one for the west and north, and the other for the east and south,—connected since 1871 by a tunnel 7518 feet in length.

Though its existence as a maritime power was originally due to its port, Genoa has only begun since 1870 to construct the conveniences necessary for the modern development of its trade. As early as 1134 the old pier (Molo Vecchio) was in existence, stretching westward into the gulf; and in 1639 the new pier (Molo Nuovo) from the other side of the gulf was commenced, after the plans of Ansaldo de Mari. Up to 1878 the former had a length of 2800 feet, and the latter was only slightly longer. The harbour thus formed was in some respects a good one; the bottom being of clay furnished excellent anchorage, and within the new pier there was depth for the largest class of vessels. But a swell was always felt whenever the wind was at any point between S.W. and S.E.
[9:10:157]

The vast bequests of the duke of Galliera have enabled the authorities to undertake (1878) an elaborate scheme for the extension and improvement of the port, including, not only a great addition of the harbour area, but also the construction of a system of wharves and warehouses, which have hitherto been surprisingly insufficient. It is difficult to believe that in one of the greatest harbours of Europe the goods should be “discharged into lighters, slowly towed by rowing boats to the side of the quays, removed by hand labour from the lighters to uncovered quays, and again transferred by hand labour tι the railway.” In spite of all these disadvantages the shipping trade of Genoa has rapidly increased since the consolidation of Italy. From 1815 to 1825 there was a large trade in grain, with a corresponding expansion of other branches. A sudden change was produced by a system of differential duties in favour of native grain; instead of 1000 foreign vessels with a tonnage of 95,000 as in 1821-5, there were only 760 vessels on an average in the three years 1825-8; and there was no corresponding increase in native shipping, which rose only from 55 to 70 vessels. The more liberal tariffs attached to the commercial treaties, concluded about 1852 with France, England, and Germany, gave a new impulse to foreign trade, and this -was followed up by Count Cavour’s law exempting all foreign grain from duty. The principal imports are petroleum, raw cotton, wool, grain, coal, metal goods, hides, tobacco, and English-cured fish. The total value imported in 1876 was £14,324,347, and in 1877 £12,066,911, while the exports for the same years amounted to £2,088,578 and £1,968,503—exclusive in both cases of goods merely in transit. During the five years 1873-7 the total number of vessels arriving at Genoa was on an average 2633 per annum, with an annual tonnage of more than 1,000,000 tons. Of these vessels about 1510 per annum sailed under the Italian flag with 533,900 tons; 421 were English with 284,390 tons, and 320 French with 105,945 tons. The opening of the St Gotthard Bailway is expected to give a great impulse to Genoese trade.

The local industry devotes itself mainly to the manufacture of cotton and silk, gold, silver, ivory, and coral, paper and leather goods, macaroni and vermicelli, sugar, and preserved fruits. The coarser cotton cloths or bordatti are the favourite wear of the Ligurian population. Iron-founding and shipbuilding are carried on in the district, and there is a growing export trade in all articles of market gardening and floriculture.

In Michelet’s phrase, it may almost be said that Genoa was a bank before it was a city, and its money business is still greater than that of any other town in Italy. The Bank of St George, founded in 1407, was “one of the most ancient and celebrated banks of circulation and deposit in Europe," but it never recovered from the damage done to its credit by the appropriation of its treasure, first by the Austrians in 1740, and again by the French in 1800. It no longer exists, and the famous building of the 13th century in which it was accommodated is now used as a customs house. A new bank was founded at Genoa in 1844, which, since its union in 1855 with a similar institution at Turin, bears the name of the National Bank. It has branches at Turin, Florence, Milan, and Naples. Up till 1871 its only important rival was the Cassa di Sconto, but about this time the Genoese, in the words of the British consul, “went mad on the subject of new companies, and in a single year they started not less than thirty-three banking, trading, mining, shipping, and manufacturing concerns.” The result was a series of bankruptcies. Bank after· bank failed; and criminal proceedings were in several cases instituted against the bank directors. The only notes current in Genoa in 1875 were those of the National Bank and the Tuscan National Bank.

The Genoese have long been known as a hard-working and frugal people; and the lower classes of the whole Ligurian coast are inured to privation and hardships. Since about 1850 there has been a strong current of emigration to South America. About 1858 the Ligurian settlers in Monte Video, Buenos Ayres, Rio de la Plata, Rio Janeiro, Lima, and Valparaiso were estimated at 60,000; and since that date the number of emigrants leaving northern Italy by way of Genoa has increased to 80,000 or 90,000 per annum. A very considerable proportion of this number return to their native country in their latter years, and the successful adventurer usually assists his younger brethren to follow in his footsteps. A large trade has sprung up with South America, the newest feature of which is an exportation of Piedmontese wine.

According to the returns of 1876, the income of Genoa was 6,343,175 francs, including octroi dues for 4,326,000 francs. The ordinary, extraordinary, and casual expenses for 1875 were—for municipal administration, 608,461 francs; local police and sanitary expenses, 1,038,418; administration of law, 227,376; public works, 2,312,470; education, 692,662; religious worship, 12,117; and public charitie3, 648,468 francs. The debt of the city in 1876 was 36,731,457 francs.

The council directing the local government of the city is chosen by a body, according to the last returns, of 41,984 electors, every citizen paying 40 franc3 of taxes being entitled to vote, and every voter being eligible as a councillor. The head of the cc·uncil is the syndic or mayor, chosen by the king from the 12 members of the giunta or administrative committee, who are themselves appointed from the entire body of the 60 municipal councillors. Besides possessing this municipal council, Genoa is also the seat of the provincial council, elected in the same way, but presided over by the prefect, or representative of the Government.

In 1848 the population of the city was 100,382; by 1862 it had increased to 127,986, but a careful census undertaken by the municipality in 1871 found no more than 120,595, exclusive, however, both of resident strangers and absent natives. The principal causes which had tended to retard the natural growth of the population were the cholera of 1866-67, and the small-pox of 1870,—the latter having actually occasioned an excess of 1178 deaths over the births for the year. To this must be added the removal of the Government arsenal to Spezia in 1870-1, and the tendency, which has gradually made itself felt since the opening of the railways, to settle in the suburban towns. The stretch of coast for miles along the gulf is an almost continuous line of country houses and mansions, and indeed, to quote the words of Μ. Reclus, the whole riviera from Ventimiglia to Spezia assumes more and more the aspect of a single town where the populous quarters alternate with groups of villas and gardens. Proceeding westwards we are no sooner beyond the fortifications than we find ourselves in the flourishing town of Sampierdarena, that is, San Pier d’Arena, or St Peter of the Sands. Down to the middle of last century it was mainly inhabited by the wealthier classes, but has since become the seat of great industrial and commercial activity. Its population, which in 1814 was only 5345, was upwards of 17,000 in 1877. From Sampierdarena a stone bridge of the 16th century, memorable as the spot when Masséna signed the capitulation of Genoa, leads across the Polcevera to Corneliano, a market-town with 2698 inhabitants at the census of 1871; and Corneliano in its turn connects itself with Sestri Ponente, a busy place of from 9000 to 10,000 inhabitants, with a large shipbuilding trade. Towards the cast there is a similar succession of villages and towns.

History.— The early importance, both political and commercial, of Genoa is attested by the part which it played in the Second Punic War. Its supremacy amongst the neighbouring municipalities and populations is not less evident from the inscription on the bronze table still to be seen in the council-hall of the city. Its history during the dark ages, throughout the Lombard and Carolingian periods, is but the repetition of the general history of the Italian communes, which succeeded in snatching from contending princes and barons the first charters of their freedom. The patriotic spirit and naval prowess of the Genoese, developed in their defensive Avars against the Saracens,· led to the foundation of a popular constitution, and to the rapid growth of a powerful marine. From the necessity of leaguing together against the common Saracen foe, Genoa united with Pisa in expelling the Moslems from the island of Sardinia; but the Sardinian territory thus acquired soon furnished occasions of jealousy to the conquering allies, and there commenced between the two republics the long naval wars destined to terminate so fatally for Pisa. With not less adroitness than Venice, Genoa saw and secured all the advantages of the great carrying trade which the crusades created between Western Europe and the East. The seaports wrested at the same period from the Saracens along the Spanish and Barbary coasts became important Genoese colonies, whilst in the Levant, on the shores of the Black Sea, and along the banks of the Euphrates were erected Genoese fortresses, of which the strength some 40 years ago commanded the admiration of the young traveller Moltke. No wonder if these conquests generated in the minds of the Venetians and the Pisans fresh jealousy against Genoa, and provoked fresh wars; but the struggle between Genoa and Pisa was brought to a disastrous conclusion for the latter state by the battle of Meloria. The commercial and naval successes of the Genoese during the Middle Ages were the more remarkable because, unlike their rivals, the Venetians, they were the unceasing prey to intestine discord—the Genoese commons and nobles fighting against each other, rival factions amongst the nobles themselves striving to grasp the supreme power in the state, nobles and commons alike invoking the arbitration and rule of some foreign captain as the sole means of obtaining a temporary truce. From these contests of rival nobles, in which the names of Spinola and Doria stand forth with greatest prominence, Genoa was soon drawn into the great vortex of the Guelph and Ghibelline factions; but its recognition of foreign authority—successively German, Neapolitan, and Milanese—gave way to a state of greater independence in 1339, when the government assumed a more permanent form with the appointment of the first doge, an office held at Genoa for life, in the person of Simon Boccanera. Alternate victories and defeats of the Venetians and Genoese—the most terrible being the defeat sustained by the Venetians at Chioggia in 1380—ended by establishing the great relative inferiority of the Genoese rulers, who fell under the power now of France, now of the Visconti of Milan, until the national spirit appeared to regain its ancient vigour in 1528, when Andrea Doria succeeded in throwing off the French domination and restoring the old form of [9:10:158] government It was at this very period, the close of the 15th and commencement of the 16th century, that the genius and daring of a Genoese mariner, Christopher Columbus, gave to Spain that new world, which might have become the possession of his native state, had Genoa been able to supply him with the ships and seamen which he so earnestly entreated her to furnish. The government as restored by Andrea Doria, with certain modifications tending to impart to it a more conservative character, remained unchanged until the outbreak of the French Revolution and the creation of the Ligurian republic. During this long period of nearly three centuries, in which the most dramatic incident is the conspiracy of Fieschi, the Genoese found no small compensation for their lost traffic in the East in the vast profits which they made as the bankers of the Spanish crown and outfitters of the Spanish armies and fleets both in the Old World and the New.

The short-lived Ligurian republic was soon swallowed up in the French empire, not, however, until Genoa had been made to experience, by the terrible privations of the siege when Masséna held the city against the Austrians (1800), all that was meant by a participation in the vicissitudes of the French Revolution. In 1814 Genoa rose against the French, on the assurance given by Lord William Bentinck that the allies would restore to the republic its independence. It had, however, been determined by a secret clause of the treaty of Paris that Genoa should be incorporated with the dominions of the king of Sardinia. The discontent created at the time by the provision of the treaty of Paris as confirmed by the congress of Vienna had doubtless no slight share in keeping alive in Genoa the republican spirit which, through the influence of a young Genoese citizen, Joseph Mazzini, assumed forms of permanent menace not only to the Sardinian monarchy but to all the established Governments of the peninsula. Even the material benefits accruing from the union with Sardinia and the constitutional liberty accorded to all his subjects by King Charles Albert were unable to prevent the republican outbreak of 1850, when, after a short and sharp struggle the city, momentarily seized by the republican party, was recovered by General Alfonzo La Marmora. The most important of the later events in the history of Genoa has been the seizure within its port of the five Neapolitan brigands, Cipriano La Gala and his accomplices, who travelling with papal passports were arrested on board the French passenger steamer, the “Aunis,” by orders of the Marquis Gualterio prefect of Genoa. Though the event threatened at first to create a rupture between the French and Italian Governments, the diplomatic discussions which it called forth, and the impression generally produced throughout Europe, had no slight share in weakening the political ties which had hitherto existed between the Papal Government and· France.

Among the earlier Genoese historians the most important are Bartolommeo Fazio and Jacopo Bracelli, both of the 15th century, and Paolo Partenopeo, Jacopo Bonfadio, Oberto Foglietta, and Agostino Giustiniano of the 16th. Paganetti wrote the ecclesiastical history of the city; and Accinelli and Gaggero collected material for the ecclesiastical archaeology. The memoirs of local writers and artists were treated by Soprani and Ratti. Among more general works are Brêquigny, Histoire des Revolutions de Gênes jusqu'en 1748; Serra, La Storia delΓ antica Liguria e di Genova (Turin, 1834); Varesi, Storia della republica di Genova sino al 1814 (Genoa, 1835-39); Canale, Storia dei Genovesi (Genoa, 1844-54), Xuova istoria della repubblica di Genova (Florence, 1853), and Storia Mia rep. di Genova da!Γ anno 1528 al 1550 (Genoa, 1874); Blumenthal, Zur Verfassungs∙ und Verwaltungsgeschichte Genua's im 12 Jahrhundert (Kalbe an der Saale, 1872); Mallison, Studies from Genoese History (London, 1875). The Liber iurium reipublicoe Genuensis was edited by Ricotti in the 7th, 8th, and 9th volumes of the Monumenta historiae patriot (Turin, 1854-1857). A great variety of interesting matter will be found in the Atti della Società Ligure di Storia patria (13 volumes, from 1861-1878), and in the Giornale Ligustico di Archeologia, Storia, e Bell’ Arti. The history of the university has been written by Lorenzo Isnardi, and continued by Em. Celesia (2 vols., Genoa). Belgrano, Della vita privata dei Genovesi, P. Μ. Garibaldi, Stato meteorologico per la città de Genova (for 1870, <fcc.), and Rocca, Pesi e misure antichi di Genova, may also be mentioned. A Vocabulario tascabile genovese-italiano compiled by P. F. B. is published by the deaf-mute publishing department.
