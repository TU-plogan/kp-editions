GERVAISE of Canterbury, born about 1150, was one of the monks of the priory of Christ Church, Canterbury, and witnessed the burning of the cathedral in 1174. His earliest known literary effort was a Tractatus de Combustione et Reparatione Dordbornensis Ecclesioe, being an account of that conflagration and of the subsequent process of rebuilding, written probably about 1184. This was followed about 1194 by Imaginationes de discordiis inter monachos Caηtuarieηses et Archiepiscopum Baldewinum, a detailed relation of clerical disputes which had occurred during the episcopate of Baldwin from 1185 to 1190. Gervaise’s [9:10:552] Chronica de tempore regum Anglioe, Stephani, Hennci II., et Ricardi I., brings the history down to the death of the last named (1199); but his Vitce Dοrοbοrnensium Archi-episcοpοrum closes with that of Reginald Fitz-Joceline(1191). These works, which are all of them characterized by laboriousness and trustworthiness, are reprinted in Twysden’s Historice Aηglicαηce Scriptores (vol. x.). In the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, there is an unpublished MS., also by Gervaise, containing a work entitled Mappa Mundi, and also an English chronicle from the fabulous ages to the death of Richard. The year of the death of Gervaise is not recorded, but the fact that he does not appear to have accomplished any part of his promised chronicle of the reign of John may fairly be taken to imply that he did not live long after 1200. See Wright, Bio-graρhia Britannica (1846).
