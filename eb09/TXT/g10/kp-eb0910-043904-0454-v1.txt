GERARD, variously surnamed Tum, Tunc, Tenque, or Thom (c. Γ040-1120), founder of the order of the knights hospitallers of St John or of Malta, was born at Amalfi about the year 1040. According to other accounts Martigues in Provence was his birthplace, while one authority even names the Château d’Avesnes in Hainault. Whether as a soldier or a merchant, he in the course of the latter part of the 11th century found his way to Jerusalem, where a hospice had for some time existed for the convenience of those who wished to visit the holy places. Of this institution Gerard became guardian or provost at a date not later than 1100; and here he organized that religious order of St John which received papal recognition from Pascal II. in 1113, by a bull which was renewed and confirmed by Calixtus II. shortly before the death of Gerard in 1120.
