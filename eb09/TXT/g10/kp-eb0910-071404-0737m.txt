GODÂVARI, a river of Central India, which flows across the Deccan from the western to the Eastern Ghâts, for sanctity, picturesque scenery, and utility surpassed only by the Ganges and the Indus. The total length is 898 miles; the estimated area of drainage basin, 112,200 square miles. Its traditional source is on the side of a hill behind the village of Trimbak in Nasik district, Bombay, but according to popular legend it proceeds from the same ultimate source as the Ganges, though underground. Its course is generally south-easterly. After passing through Nasik district, it crosses into the dominions of the nizâm of Hyderabad. When it again strikes British territory it is joined by the Pranhita, with its tributaries the Waraha, the Penganga, and ∖∖ ainganga. For some distance it flows between the Nizâm’s dominions and the upper Godâvari district, and receives the Indravati, the Sal, and the Sabâri. The stream ts now very imposing, with a channel varying from 1 to 2 miles in breadth, occasionally broken by alluvial islands. Parallel to the river stretch long ranges of hills; on the opposite side the country is more open and cultivated. Below the junction of the Sabâri the scenery is such that the Godâvari has got the name of the Indian Rhine. The channel here begins to contract. The flanking hills gradually close in on both sides, and the result is a magnificent gorge only 200 yards wide through which the water flows into the plain of the delta, about 60 miles from the sea. The head of the delta is at the village of Dhaulaishvaram, where the main stream is crossed by the irrigation anicut. The river has seven mouths, the largest being the Gautami Godâvari. The Godâvari is regarded as peculiarly sacred, and once every twelve years the great bathing festival called Pushharam is held on its banks.

The upper waters of the Godâvari are scarcely utilized for irrigation, but the entire delta has been turned into a garden of perennial crops by means of the anicut at Dhaulaishvaram, from which three main canals are drawn off. The river channel here is 3⅜ miles wide. The anicut is a substantial mass of stone, bedded in lime cement, about 2⅛ miles long, 130 feet broad at the base, and 12 feet high. The stream is thus pent back so as to supply a volume of 3000 cubic feet of water per second during its low season, and 12,000 cubic feet at time of flood. The canals have a total length of 528 miles, capable of irrigating 780,000 acres, while 463 miles are also used for navigation. In 1864 water-communication was opened between the riversystems of the Godâvari and Kistna. Rocky barriers and rapids obstruct navigation in the upper portion of the Godâvari. Attempts have been made to construct canals round these barriers but with little success, and lately the undertaking has been entirely abandoned.
