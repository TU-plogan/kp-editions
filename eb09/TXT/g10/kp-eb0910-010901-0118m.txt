GATTY, Mrs Alfred (1809-1873), daughter of the Rev. Dr Scott, chaplain to Lord Nelson, was born at Burnham, Essex, in 1809. In 1839 Margaret Scott was married to the Rev. Alfred Gatty, D.D., vicar of Ecclesfield near Sheffield, sub-dean of York cathedral, and the author of various works both secular and religious. In 1842 she published in association with her husband a life of her father, the Rev. Dr Scott; but her first independent work was The Fairy Godmother and other Tales , which appeared in 1851. This was followed in 1855 by the first of five volumes of Parables from Nature, the last being published in 1871. It is under the nom de plume of Aunt Judy, as a pleasant and instructive writer for children, that Mrs Gatty is most widely known. Previous to commencing Aunt Judy's Magazine in May 1866, she had brought out Aunt Judιfs Tales and Aunt Judfs Letters·, and among the other children’s books which she subsequently published, were Ayιιt Judy's Song Book for Children and The Mother's Book of Poetry. Besides other excellences her children’s books are specially characterized by wholesomeness of sentiment and cheerful humour. Her miscellaneous writings include, in addition to several volumes of tales, The Old Folks from Home, an account of a holiday ramble in Ireland; The Travels and Adventures of Dr Wolff the Missionary, in which she was assisted by her husband; British Sea Weeds; Waifs and Strays of Natural History·, A Book of Emblems ; and The Book of Sun-Dials. She died October 3, 1873.
