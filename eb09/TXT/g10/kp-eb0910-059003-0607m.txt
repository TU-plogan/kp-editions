GIJON, a town and seaport of Spain, in the province of Oviedo or Asturias, on the coast of the Cantabrian Sea, about 13 miles E. of the Cabo de Penas and 2 miles E. of the Rio Abono. The older part of the town, partly surrounded by its walls, occupies the upper slope of a peninsular headland, while the more modern portion extends to the beach. On the whole, it is a clean and flourishing place, with wide streets and good houses; but there are few buildings of individual note except the church of San Pedro of the 15th century, the town house, the mansion of the Marquis Revilla-Gigedo, and the Asturian Institute. The last, which was founded in 1797 by Jovellanos, has a fine library, and comprises classes for navigation, mathematics, Latin, French, and English. Besides the works in connexion with the railways which run inland from Gijon to Mieres del Camino and Sama on the Nalon, there is a large glass work, an iron foundry, and a tobacco factory which alone gives employment to upwards of 1400 females. An extensive trade is carried on in the export of coal, iron, jet, and hazel-nuts, and in the import of fish and colonial produce. The nuts amount to upwards of 1600 tons per annum, and a large proportion finds its way to the English market. Though the harbour is a mere roadstead between the small promontories of San Lorenzo and Torres, it is of considerable value on such a coast as that of Asturias, especially as it has a good bottom. A quay was constructed by means of a grant from Charles V. in 1552-4, and a new one by Pedro Menendez in 1766-8, and an extension was effected in 1859 at a cost of .£65;000. The population of Gijon in 1860 was 24,802. During the summer there is a considerable influx of strangers.

Gijon is usually identified with the Gigia of the Romans, which, however, occupied the site not of the present town but of the adjoining suburb of Cima da Villa. Captured and strengthened by the Moors, who used the stones of the Roman city for their fortifications, it remained in their hands till after the battle of Canicas, when its governor Munuza surrendered to Pelayo. In 844 it held out against an attack by the Normans, and in the following cen-tunes[9:10:591] it gradually rose into importance. In the time of Philip II. it possessed good arsenals, and was able to undertake the repairs of the Invincible Armada. Jovellanos, the statesman and poet, and C’ean Bermudez, a writer on art, were both natives of Gijon, and the former is buried in the church of San Andrea.
