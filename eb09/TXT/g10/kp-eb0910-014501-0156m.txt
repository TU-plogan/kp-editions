GENELLI, Giovanni Buonaventura (1798-1868), was born at Berlin, September 28, 1798, and died at Weimar, November 13, 1868. He was the son of Janus Genelli, a painter whose landscapes are still preserved in [9:10:146] the Schloss at Berlin, and grandson to Joseph Genelli, a Roman embroiderer employed to found a school of gobelins by Frederick the Great. Buonaventura Genelli first took lessons from his father and then became a student of the Berlin Academy. After serving his time in the guards he went with a stipend to Rome, where he lived ten years a friend and assi staut tρ Koch the landscape painter, a colleague of Hähuel, Reinhard, Overbeck, and Führich, all of whom made a name in art. In 1830 he was commissioned by Dr Härtel to adorn a villa at Leipsic with frescos, but quarrelling with this patron he withdrew to Munich, where he earned a scauty livelihood at first, though he succeeded at last in acquiring repute as an illustrative and figure draughtsman. In 1859 he was appointed a professor at Weimar, where he ended his days. Genelli painted few pictures, and it is very rare to find his canvasses in public galleries, but there are six of his compositions in oil in the Schack collection at Munich. These and numerous watercolours, as well as designs for engravings and lithographs, reveal an artist of considerable power whose ideal was the antique, but who was also fascinated by the works of Michelangelo. Though a German by birth, his spirit was unlike that of Overbeck or Führich, whose art was reminiscent of the old masters of their own country. He seemed to hark back to the land of his fathers and endeavour to revive the traditions of the Italian Renaissance. Subtle in thought and powerfully conceived, his compositions are usually mythological, but full of matter, energetic and fiery in execution, and marked almost invariably by daring effects of foreshortening. Impeded by straitened means, the artist seems frequently to have drawn from imagination rather than from life, and much of his anatomy of muscle is in consequence conventional and false. But none the less Genelli merits his reputation as a bold and imaginative artist, and his name deserves to be remembered beyond the narrow limits of the early schools of Munich and Weimar.
