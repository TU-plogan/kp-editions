GEIGER, Abraham (1810-1874), one of the ablest leaders of the modern Jewish school of theology and criticism, was born at Frankfort-on-the-Main, May 24, 1810. After receiving from his father and uncle the elements of an ordinary rabbinical education, he was in his eleventh year sent to the gymnasium, whence in 1829 he passed to the university of Heidelberg, which he soon afterwards exchanged for that of Bonn. As a student he greatly distinguished himself both in philosophy and in philology, and at the close of his course wrote on the relations of Judaism and Mahometanism a prize-essay which was afterwards published, in 1833, under the title Was hat Mohammed aus dem Judenthum aufgenommen ? In November 1832 he went to Wiesbaden as rabbi of the synagogue there, and, still pursuing the line of scientific study upon which he had entered during his undergraduate course, became in 1835 one of the most active promoters of the Zeitschrift für Jüdische Theologie, which appeared from 1835 to 1839, and again from 1842 to 1847. In 1838 he removed to Breslau, where he continued to reside for the next twenty-five years, and where he wrote some of his most important works, including his Lehr-und Lesebuch zur Sprache der Mischna (1845), his Studien from Maimonides (1850), his translation into German of the poems of Juda ha-Levi (Abu’l Hassan) in 1851, and the Urschrift und Uebersetzungeη der Bibel in ihrer Abhängigkeit von der innern Entwickelung des Judenthums (1857). The last-named work especially attracted much attention at the time of its appearance, and may be said to have marked a new departure in the methods of studying the records of Judaism. In 1863 Geiger became head of the synagogue of his native town, whence he removed in 1870 to Berlin, where, in addition to his duties as chief rabbi, he took the principal charge of the newly established seminary for Jewish science. The Urschrift was followed by a more exhaustive handling of one of its topics in Die Sadducäer und Pharisäer (1863), and by a more thoroughgoing application of its leading principles in an elaborate history of Judaism (Das Judenthum it. seine Geschichte) in 1865-71. Geiger also contributed frequently on Hebrew, Samaritan, and Syriac subjects to the Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenländischen Gesellschaft, and from 1862 until his death (which occurred on the 23d of October 1874) he was editor of a periodical entitled Jüdische Zeitschrift für Wissenschaft und Leben. He also published a Jewish prayer-book (Israelitisches Gebetbuch) which is well known in Germany, besides a variety of minor monographs on historical and literary subjects connected with the fortunes of his people. An Allgemeine Einleitung and five volumes of Nachgelassene Schriften were edited by his son L. Geiger in 1875.
