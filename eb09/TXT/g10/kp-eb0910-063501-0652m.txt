GLANVIL, Glanvill, or Glanville, Ranulph de (died 1190), the oldest writer on English jurisprudence and chief justiciary of England in the reign of Henry II., was born at Stratford in Suffolk, but in what year is unknown. There is also almost no information regarding his early life. Butterley Abbey was founded by him in 1171. In 1174, along with other barons of Yorkshire, he raised a body of knights to oppose William the Lion, king of Scotland, who had invaded the north of England, and it was he who took the king prisoner at Alnwick. In 1175 he was appointed sheriff of Yorkshire, in 1176 justice of the king’s court and a justice itinerant in the northern circuit, and in 1180 chief justiciary of all England. It was under his direction that Henry II. completed his judicial reforms, but the principal of them had been carried out before he came into office. After the death of Henry in 1189 Glanvil was removed from his office by Richard I., and imprisoned till he had paid a ransom, according to one authority, of .£15,000. Shortly after obtaining his freedom he joined the order of the cross, and he died at the siege of Acre in 1190. At the instance, it is supposed, of Henry II., Glanvil wrote or superintended the writing of the Tractatus le legibus et consuetudinibus reyni Anglia?, which is divided into 14 books, and is chiefly a practical treatise on the forms of procedure in the curia regis or king’s court, the principles of law involved in these forms being only incidentally referred to. As the source of our knowledge regarding the earliest form of the curia regis, and for the information it affords regarding ancient customs and laws, it is of great value to the student of English history. It is now generally agreed that the work of Glanvil is of earlier date than the Regiam Majestatem, a work which bears a close resemblance to his. To him is also ascribed the recension of English laws made in the reign of Henry II.

The treatise of Glanvil was first printed in 1554. An English translation, with, notes and introduction by John Beames, was published at London in 1812. A MS. copy of a Norman-French translation, made apparently in the reign of King John, is contained in the library of the duke of Northumberland at Alnwick Castle.
