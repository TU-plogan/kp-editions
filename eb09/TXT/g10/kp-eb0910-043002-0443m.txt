GEORGETOWN, the port of entry for the District of Columbia in the United States of North America, is situated on the left bank of the Potomac at the head of navigation, about 2⅛ miles W.N.W. of the capitol of Washington City, with which it communicates by four iron bridges thrown across Rock Creek. Founded by the colonial Government of Maryland in 1751, Georgetown was a city with a distinct administration from 1789 to 1871; but in the latter year it was merged in the District of Columbia, and in 1878 it was incorporated with the city of Washington, so that now it has properly no distinct existence. It is beautifully situated along a range of hills, whose loftier eminences, locally called the Heights, afford delightful positions for villas and country seats, with extensive prospects over the river and Washington. The most noteworthy institution is Georgetown College, the oldest Roman Catholic college in the United States, which occupies two handsome brick buildings in the midst of extensive grounds at the west end. It was founded as an academy in 1789, was chartered as a college in 1799, and in 1815 received the right of conferring degrees. Its medical department, originated in 1851, and the legal department, dating from 1870, are both in Washington. The university has a library of upwards of 30,000 volumes, an extensive apparatus for physical science, and a museum of natural history. In 1873 the teaching staff numbered 35. Among the other institutions in the town may be mentioned the Convent of the Visitation, with a female academy attached; the Peabody library; the Linthicum institute (founded in 1872 by a retired merchant, who left $50,000 for the education of poor white boys); the aged women’s house, maintained by voluntary subscription; and the industrial home for juvenile vagrants. The aqueduct which conveys a branch of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal over the Potomac is 1446 feet long, and its granite piers, nine in number, rise 36 feet above the ordinary surface of the water, and rest on the solid rock 17 feet below the bottom of the river. A great decline has taken place in the commercial activity of Georgetown. Its foreign trade is very slight, being represented in the year ending June 30, 1878, by no more than6113 dollars of importsand 10,056 dollars of exports; but its share in the coasting trade is still considerable, 187 steamers and 45 sailing vessels, affording a total tonnage of 96,339 tons, having entered in the year already mentioned; its position at the terminus of the Chesapeake and Ohio canal secures for it a fair share in the shipping of the coal from the Alleghany fields; and its fisheries render it a great market for shad and herrings. Among the industrial establishments the first place is held by the flour-mills, six in number; but there are also cornmills, timberyards, tanneries, foundries, breweries, a papermill, and a vinegar factory. The principal cemetery for Washington occupies a beautiful situation on Georgetown Heights. In 1830 the population of Georgetown was 8441; in 1840 it was only 7312; by 1860 it had reached 8733; and in 1870 it was 11,384.
