GERS, a department of France, composed of the whole or parts of the five old districts of Gascony, viz., Armagnac, Astarac, Lomagne, Comminges, and Condomois. It is bounded N. by the department of Lot-et-Garonne, E. by Tarn-et-Garonne and Haute-Garonne, S. by Hautes-Pyrénées and Basses-Pyrénées, and W. by Landes. It lies between 43 c 17'and 44° 5' N. lat.,and between 1° 10' E., and 0 e 18' W. long., being about 72 miles in length from E. to W., and 53 in breadth from N. to S. This department is hilly, particularly in the south, where it is mostly covered with ramifications of the Pyrenees. Some of these in the south rise nearly 1200 feet above the level of the sea, but they rapidly decrease in height towards the north. The principal of them run from N.E., N., and N.∖Y., and are separated by longitudinal valleys of great beauty and fertility, narrow in the south, but opening in the north to a width of 3 or 4 miles. . The greater part of the department belongs to the basin of the Garonne, while a small portion in the west is drained by the Adour. The chief affluents of the former are the Save, G imone, A rratz, G ers, an d Baise; and those of the latter, the Arros, Midou, and Douse, the last two uniting and taking the name of Midouse, before joining the Adour. The climate is temperate and salubrious, but very changeable. There is seldom any snow, and there [9:10:549] Î3 scarcely any frost. More than half of the department is arable; about one-seventh is occupied by vines, and the rest is meadows, wood, or heath. The soil is not of great fertility, but is tolerably well cultivated, and the grain produced is more than sufficient for home consumption. Wheat, maize, oats, and rye are the principal grain crops. About one-third of the wine produced is used for home consumption, and the remainder is chiefly manufactured into brandy, known by the name of Armagnac. The amount of brandy distilled in the department annually is about 22 million gallons. Horned cattle, sheep, mules, swine, game, and poultry, particularly ducks and geese, are abundant. The minerals and manufactures are unimportant. There are quarries of red and green marble; and gypsum, marl, white clay, and sand for the manufacture of glass are obtained. Gers is divided into the arrondissements of Auch, Lectoure, Mirande, Condom, and Lombez, with 29 cantons and 467 commune3. The chief town is Auch. The total area is 2425 square miles, and the population in 1866 was 295,692, and 283,546 in 1876.
