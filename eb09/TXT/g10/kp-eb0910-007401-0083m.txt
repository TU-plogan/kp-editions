GARÇAO, Pedro Antonio Correa (1724-1772), Portuguese lyric and dramatic poet, was born in the neighbourhood of Lisbon on the 24th of April 1724. Almost nothing of his biography is known except that he lived a life of quiet domesticity and learned leisure, in a rural retreat at Fonte-Santa near the capital, till about his thirtysixth year, when he was imprisoned on an obscure charge which is believed to have arisen out of some expressions in his writings that had given offence to a despotic Government. After languishing in confinement for eighteen months, he was released by death on the 10th of November 1772. His works, which include sonnets, odes, satires, and epistles, as well as dramatic pieces, were published for the first time iu a collected form in 1778 (f)bras poeticas de P. Λ. C. Gαrςao), and are regarded by the Portuguese as having marked a period of revival in their national literature. While, however, in an age of great degeneracy he succeeded in exhibiting purity and refinement of taste, he cannot be said to have given any indications of an original or powerful genius. His dramas are confessedly imitations from foreign models; while his odes, epistles, and satires, which have earned for him the title (shared by Ferreira) of “the Portuguese Horace,” at once reveal the source of their inspiration. His endeavour, moreover, occasionally to approach the classic style more nearly by substituting quantity for rhyme can hardly be regarded as very successful.
