GORDIANUS, or Gordian, the name of three Roman emperors. The first, Marcus Antonius Africanus Gordianus, the wealthiest of the Romans, was descended on the father’s side from the Gracchi, on the mother’s from Trajan, while his wife was the granddaughter of Antoninus Pius. While he gained unbounded popularity by his magnificent games and shows, his prudent and retired life did not alarm the tyranny of Caracalla. Alexander Severus called him to the dangerous honours of government in Africa, and during his proconsulship there occurred the usurpation of Maximin. The universal discontent roused by the oppressive rule of Maximin culminated in a revolt in Africa in 238, and Gordian reluctantly yielded to the popular clamour and assumed the purple. His son was associated with him in the dignity. The senate confirmed the choice of the Africans, and most of the provinces gladly sided with the new emperors; but, even while their cause was so successful abroad, they had fallen before the sudden inroad of Capel! ianus, who commanded Mauretania in the interest of Maximin. They had reigned only 36 days. Both the Gordians had deserved by their amiable character their high reputation; they were men of great accomplishments, fond of literature, and voluminous authors; but they were rather intellectual voluptuaries than able statesmen or powerful rulers. Having embraced the cause of Gordian, the senate was obliged to continue the revolt against Maximin, and appointed Maximus and Balbinus, two of its noblest and most esteemed members, as joint emperors. At their inauguration a sedition arose, and the popular outcry for a Gordian was appeased by the association of M. Antonius Gordianus Pius, nephew of the younger and grandson of the elder Gordian, a boy of thirteen. Maximin forthwith invaded Italy, but was murdered by his own troops while besieging Aquileia; and a revolt of the praetorian guards, to which Maximus and Balbinus fell victims, left Gordian sole emperor. For some years he was under the control of his mother’s eunuchs, till happily Misitheus, his teacher of rhetoric, whose daughter he married, roused him to free himself from the ignoble tyranny. Misitheus was appointed prefect of the praetorian guards, and wielded ably the supreme power that now belonged to him. When the Persians invaded Mesopotamia, the young emperor at his persuasion opened, for the last time recorded in history, the temple of Janus, and marched in person to the East. Misitheus proved a skilful and prudent general; but his sudden death under strong suspicions of poisoning was the end of Gordian’s prosperity. Discontent and seditions, fostered by Philip, who had succeeded Misitheus, arose in the camp, and Gordian was slain by the mutinous soldiers (244). A monument near the confluence of the Euphrates and Aboras marked the scene.
