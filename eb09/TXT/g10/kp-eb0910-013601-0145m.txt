GEMINIANI, Francesco (c. 1680-1762), a celebrated violinist, born at Lucca about 1680. He received lessons in music from Alessandro Scarlatti, and studied the violin under Lunati, and afterwards under Corelli. In 1714 he arrived in London, where his performance and compositions attracted much attention. He was taken under the special protection of the earl of Essex. After visiting Paris and •residing there for some time, he returned to England in 1755. In 1761 he went to Dublin, where a servant robbed him of a musical manuscript on which he had •bestowed much time and labour. His vexation at this loss is said to have hastened his death, which took place at Dublin on 17th September 1762. He appears to have been a first-rate violinist, but most of his compositions are dry and deficient in melody. His Art of Playing the Violin is a good work of its kind, but his Guida Armonica is a miserable production. He published a number of solos for the violin, three sets of violin concertos, twelve violin trios, The Art of Accompaniment on the Harpsichord, Organ, &c., Lessons for the Harpsichord, and some other works. His musical opinions had no foundation in truth or principle.
