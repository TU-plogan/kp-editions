GÉRARD, Étienne Maurice, Count (1773-1852), a distinguished French general, was born at Damvilliers in the department of Meuse, 4th April 1773. He joined the second battalion of the Meuse in 1791, and served in the campaigns of 1792-1793 under Generals Dumouriez and Jourdan. In 1798 he accompanied Bernadotte as aide-decamp in his embassy to Vienna. In 1799 he was named chief of a squadron, and in 1800 colonel. He distinguished himself by a brilliant charge against the Russian imperial guard at the battle of Austerlitz, and being raised to the rank of general in November 1806, played a prominent part in the battles of Halle, Jena, and Erfurt; and for his conduct in the battle of Wagram, where he greatly contributed to the victory, he was created a baron. In the Spanish campaign of 1810 and 1811 he gained special distinction at the battle of Fuentes-de-Onoro; and in the subsequent expedition to Russia he was present at the capture of Smolensk, had a principal share in the victory of Walontina-Gora, displayed such bravery and ability in the battle of the Moskova that he was made general of division, ≈and by his coolness and energy in the disastrous retreat from Moscow saved the rearguard of the French army at the passage of the Wilna. In the campaign of 1813, in command of a division under Macdonald, he took part in the battles of Lützen, Bautzen, Goldberg, and Leipsic, where he was dangerously wounded. After the battle of Bautzen he was created by Napoleon a count of the empire. In the campaign of France of 1814, in command of the army of reserves composed chiefly of recruits, he by his skilful manoeuvres powerfully assisted in securing the victories of Nogent, Nangis, and Montereau-sur-Yonne. After the first restoration he was named by Louis XVIII. grand cross of the legion of honour and chevalier of St Louis. On the return of Napoleon from Elba he was entrusted with the command of the army of the Moselle, and took part in the battle of Ligny. On the morning of the battle of Waterloo, being under the orders of Grouchy, who was marching towards Wavre, he strongly urged him to proceed in the direction whence they heard cannon firing, but his advice was not followed. Gérard retired to Brussels after the fall of Napoleon, and did not return to France till 1817. He was chosen a member of the chamber of deputies in 1822, and was re-elected in 1823 and 1827. He took part in the revolution of 1830, after which he was appointed minister of war and named a marshal of France. On account of his health he resigned the office of w ar minister in the October following, but in 1831 he took the command of the northern army, and was successful in thirteen days in driving the army of Holland out of Belgium. In 1832 he compelled the surrender of Antwerp, and in the same year he was raised to the peerage of France. He was again chosen war minister in July 1834, and again resigned that office in the October following. In 1835 he was named grand chancellor of the legion of honour, and in 1838 commander-general of the national guards of the Seine, an office which he held till 1842. He became a senator under the empire in 1852, and died in April of the same year.
