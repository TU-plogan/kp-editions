GARTH, Sir Samuel (16701-1719), a physician and. poet of the age of Anne, was born of a good Yorkshire family, in 1670, it is said, but more probably at an earlier date. He was a student of Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he resided until be was received into the College of Physicians in 1691. In 1696 he became a prominent supporter of the new scheme of providing dispensaries for the relief cf the sick poor, as a protection against the greed of the apothecaries. This labour having exposed him to the animosity of many of his own profession, and especially of the last-named body, he published in 1699 a mock-heroic poem, The Dispensary, in six cantos, which had an instant success, passing through three editions within the year. Garth became the leading physician of the Whigs, as Radcliffe was of the Tories. In 1714 he was knighted by George I., and he died on the 18th of January 1718-19. Garth was a wealthy man, leaving estates in Warwickshire, Oxfordshire, and Buckinghamshire. He wrote little besides his best-known work The Dispensary, and Claremont, a moral epistle in verse. In 1717 he edited a translation of Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses, himself supplying the fourteenth and part of the fifteenth book. The subject of his mock-heroic epic is treated in a cumbrous style; and even in his own day Garth was accused of flatness and poverty of thought.
