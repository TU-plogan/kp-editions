GANGI, a town of Italy, in the province of Palermo, and circondario of Cefalu, about 22 miles inland from the town of Cefalu. It occupies the slope of a hill on the southern flanks of the Nebrode or Monte Marone, and the ridge of the hill is crowned by a striking fortress with three towers, only one of which, however, is entire. The inhabitants, who in 1871 numbered 12,921, cultivate grain and manufacture cheese iu sufficient quantities to maintain a moderate trade. Gangi Vetere or Old Gangi, in the vicinity, is identified, according to a conjecture of Cluverius, with the ancient Enguium or Engyum. The foundation of Enguium was ascribed by Diodorus Siculus and Plutarch to a Cretan [9:10:69] settlement, and Plutarch relates that relics of Meriones and Ulysses were exhibited in his time in the town. Having sided with the Carthaginians in the Second Punic War, it was saved from the vengeance of Marcellus by the entreaties of a certain Nicias. At the close of the republic it was a municipal town, with considerable celebrity on account of the temple of the Great Mother, as Cicero calls her. '-GANGOTRI, a celebrated place of Hindu pilgrimage, situated among the Himâlaya Mountains, in the state of Gârhwal, on the Ganges, which is here not above 15 or 20 yards broad, with a moderate current, and not in general above 3 feet deep. The course of the river runs N. by E.; and on the bank near Gangotri there is a small temple about 8 or 10 feet high, in which are two images representing the Ganges and Bhâgirathi rivers. The bed of the river adjoining the temple is divided off by the Brahmans into three basins, where the pilgrims bathe. One of these portions is dedicated to Brahma, another to Vishnu, and the third to Siva. The pilgrimage to Gangotri is .considered efficacious in washing away the sins of the devotee, and ensuring him eternal happiness in the world to come. The water taken from this sacred spot is exported by pilgrims to India, and sold at a high price. It is drawn under the inspection of a Brahman, to whom a trifling sum is paid for the privilege of taking it, and the vessels are then sealed. The elevation of the temple above the sea is 10,319 feet. Long. 78° 59' E., lat. 30° 59' N.
