GOLTZ, Bogumil (1801-1870), humorist and satirist, was born of a German family settled at Warsaw, March 20, 1801. At the age of seven he was taken by some friends to Königsberg, and after studying at the gymnasium was placed under the care of a country clergyman near Marienwerder. He next went to the gymnasium of Marienwerder, and finally returned to Königsberg. In 1817 he began to learn practical farming on an estate near Thorn; but the strong desire which he felt for scientific culture led him, five years later, to the university of Breslau. There he at first entered upon the study of theology, but he did not pursue it, selecting instead philosophy and philology. The next year he bought an estate near Thorn, married the daughter of a Prussian officer, and applied himself to the duties of a farmer. He did not succeed; and after other equally unsuccessful experiments in the same line in Poland and Prussia, he retired in 1830 to the small town of Gollub, and devoted himself to literary studies. Sixteen years of meditative seclusion passed away; and then, having taken up his abode at Thorn, he gave to the world the first fruits of his studies and reflexions in the charming poetic Buch der Kindheit (1847), in which he delineates the incidents and impressions of his own childhood with a tender feeling like that of Jean Paul. The dates which he gives in this narrative are inconsistent with those which he furnished for the memoir in Brockhaus’s Conversations- Lexikon ; and a chronological difficulty is thus created which perhaps it may not be possible to solve.

The Buch der Kindheit was speedily followed by a satirical and polemical epistle against Ronge and the friends of enlightenment, which he entitled Deutsche Entartung in der lichtfreundlichen und modernen Lebensart. For the purpose of enlarging his experience of men, and of amassing stores of material for his art as humorist and reformer of human life and society, he undertook a course of extensive travels, visiting Germany, France, England, Italy, and Egypt. In 1850 he published Das Menschendaseyn in seinen weltewigen Zügen and Zeichen. This was followed by another poetically conceived work on his own early life, entitled Ein Jugendleben: Biographisches Idyll aus Westpreιιssen (1852), and by Ein Kleinstädter in Aegypten (1853). In his next work, Der Mensch und die Lente (1858), he especially displays his peculiar powers in profound and acute sketches of various races of men. It is a book of enduring value. His Die Deutschen, consisting of a series of studies on the history and peculiarities of the genius of the Germans, appeared in 1860. His other works are Zur Charakteristik und Naturgeschichte der Frauen (1859), Typen der Gesellschaft (1860), Die Bildung und die Gebildeten (1864), (1869), and Die Weltklugheit und die Lebensweisheit mit ihren correspondirenden Studien (1869). Goltz is a follower of Jean Paul, -and has many of the characteristics of his master; but lie takes a lower place as literary artist, wanting Jean Paul’s creative imagination. He died at Thorn, November 11, 1870.

An interesting essay on Goltz was contributed by the poet, Rudolf Gottschall, to Unsere Zeit, new series, 1871.
