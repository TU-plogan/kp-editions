GONDA, a district of Oudh, lying between 26° 46' and 27° 50' N. lat., and between 81° 35' and 82° 48' E. long., bounded on the N. by the lower range of the Himâlayas, on the E. by Basti district, on the S. by Fyzabad and Bara Banki, and on the W. by Bharaich, and having an area of 2824 square miles.

Gonda presents the aspect of a vast plain with very slight undulations, studded with groves of mango trees. The surface consists of a rich alluvial deposit which is naturally divided into three great belts known as the tarai or swampy tract, the uparhàr or uplands, and the tarhar or wet lowlands, all three being marvellously fertile. Several rivers flow through the district, but only two, the Gogra and Râpti, are of any commercial importance, the first being navigable throughout the year, and the latter during the rainy season. The country is dotted over with small lakes, [9:10:770] the water of which is largely used for irrigation. The ferce naturoe consist of tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, aud deer. Large game birds are plentiful.

This district has no particular history of its own; what ancient history it has is included in that of Oudh. On the outbreak of the mutiny, the raja of Gonda, after honourably escorting the Government treasure to Fyzabad, joined the rebels. His estates, along with those of the rani of Tulsipur, were confiscated, and conferred as rewards upon the maharajas of Balrampur and Shahganj, who had remained loyal. The census of 1869 disclosed a population of 1,166,515 (602,862 males, and563,653 females)—Hindus, 1,049,397; Mahometans, 117,070; Christians—European, Eurasian, and native —48. Five towns contain a population exceeding 5000, namely, Gonda, Balrampur, Colonelganz, Nawabganj, and Utraula. Rice, wheat, and barley are the chief products of the district. The area under cultivation is 993,858 acres. The exports are rice and food grains; the imports, cotton, European piece goods, and salt. The administration is under a deputy commissioner, aided by two European assistants. The total revenue (1875-76) amounted to £135,509; the expenditure to £15,810. The police force (1873) consisted of 484 officers and men, maintained at a cost of £6655. Education is still in its infancy. In 1875-76 there were 116 schools under Government inspection, attended by 5879 pupils. Fever is prevalent throughout the district. The other principal diseases are scurvy, cholera, diarrhoea, and goitre. The average rainfall during the eleven years 1865-1875 was 42’0 inches. The average yearly temperature is 77 - 5° Fahr., the highest recorded being 106°, the lowest 48°.

<3onda, the chief town and administrative headquarters of Gouda district, in 27° 8' N. lat. and 82° 1' E. long. The site on which the town now stands was originally a jungle, in the centre of which was a cattle fold (Gontha or Gothân), in which the cattle were enclosed at night as a protection against wild beasts, and from this the town derived its name. The place was formerly celebrated for the manufacture of shields; now it is neither of commercial nor of religious importance. The town contains a civil station, dispensary, school, literary institute, courthouse, and jail. Population, 13,722.
