GOG (j⅛) occurs in two passages of Scripture (Ezek. xxxviii.-xxxix., and Rev. xx.) as the name of a great anti-theocratic power destined to manifest itself in the world immediately before the final dispensation is ushered in. In the later passage, Gog and Magog are spoken of as coordinate; in the earlier, Gog is given as the name of the person or people, and Magog as that of the land of its origin. Notwithstanding this discrepancy, it is obvious that the passages are intimately related, and that both depend upon Gen. x. 2, where, however, Magog alone is mentioned. Here he is the second son of Japhet, and, on the assumption that a geographical order underlies these ethnographical tables, his locality is to be sought between Gomer and Madai or Media. According to Josephus, who is followed by Jerome, the Scythians were primarily intended by this designation; and this opinion has been almost universally accepted in modern times. The name ∑κι‰ι, it is to be observed, however, is often but a vague word for any or all of the numerous and but partially known tribes of the north; and any attempt to assign a more definite locality to Magog can only be very hesitatingly made. According to some, the Maiotes about the Palus Maeotis are meant; according to others, the Massage tae; according to Kiepert, the inhabitants of the northern and eastern parts of Armenia. In Ezekiel, Gog is regarded as a terrible ruler in the extreme north, being prince of Rosh, Mesech, and Tubal, as well as governor in the land of Magog, and having the support of Persia, Ethiopia, and Phut, as well as of Gomer and the house of Togarmah. It may be considered as certain that the imagery employed in this prophetic description was suggested by the Scythian invasion which about the time of Josiah had devastated Asia (Herod, i. 103 ff.). As might have been expected from the prominence given to that description in the Old Testament, Gog figures largely in Jewish and Mahometan as well as Christian eschatology. In the district of Astrakhan a legend is still to be met with, to the effect that Gog and Magog were two great races, which Alexander the Great subdued and banished to the inmost recesses of the Caucasus, where they are meanwhile kept in by the terror of twelve trumpets blown by the winds, but whence they are destined ultimately to make their escape and destroy the world. The legends that attach themselves to the effigies of Gog and Magog which are at present to be seen in Guild Hall, London, are only remotely connected, if at all, with the statements of Scripture. According to the Recuyell des Histoires de Troye, Gog and Magog were the survivors of a race of giants descended from the thirty-three wicked daughters of Diocletian; after their brethren had been slain by Brute and his companions, Gog and Magog were brought to London (Troy-novant), and compelled to officiate as porters at the gate of the royal palace. It is known that effigies similar to the present existed in London as early as the time of Henry V.; but it is uncertain at what date this legend first began to attach to them. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth (Chronicles, i, 16), Goëmot or Goëmagot (either corrupted from or corrupted into “Gog and Magog ”) was a giant who, along with his brother Corineus, tyrannized in the western horn of England until slain by foreign invaders.
