GOES, or Ter Goes, a town of the Netherlands in the province of Zealand, on the island of South Beveland, with railway communication since 1868 with Bergen-op-Zoom, and since 1872 with Middelburg, its distances from these [9:10:721] places being respectively 12 and 15 miles. The Reformed church, called in the olden times St Mary Magdalenâ€™s, is considered the finest ecclesiastical building of Zealand, and dates from 1423. In the one half, known as the Preekkerk or preaching church, there is a splendid organ, and in the other half, known as the Wandelkerk or walking church, stands the tomb of Frans Naerebout the philanthropist. Goes further boasts of a fine old town-house, a high school, and the remains of the old castle of Ostende, which was the nucleus round which it began to form itself in the 14th century. The industries of the town are varied but not extensive, dealing with linen, dyes, chocolate, oil, flour, straw hats, wood, and cigars. Shipbuilding is also carried on, as well as a trade in wood and coals. The harbour, which is defended by a fort, is formed by a short canal communicating with the eastern Scheldt, extended and improved in 1818-19. The population of the town, which received its municipal rights in 1406, and was surrounded with a wall about 1420, numbered 4916 in 1860, 5205 in 1870, and 6063 in 1876.
