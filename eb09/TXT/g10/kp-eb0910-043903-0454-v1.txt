GERARD of Cremona (1114-1187), the mediaeval translator of Ptolemy and Avicenna, was born at Cremona, Lombardy, in 1114. Dissatisfied with the meagre philosophies of his Italian teachers, he went to Toledo to study among the Moors, who were at that time the chief depositaries and interpreters of the wisdom of the ancients; and, having thus acquired a knowledge of the Arabic language, he appears to have devoted the remainder of his life to the business of'making Latin translations from its literature. The date of his return to his native town is uncertain, but he is known to have died there in 1187. His original version of Avicenna’s Canon of Medicine was the basis of all the very numerous subsequent Latin editions of that well-known work; and the Latin translation by which alone Ptolemy’s Almagest until the discovery of the original μeyaλη σvvτaLLς was known to Europe is also ascribed to him. In addition to these, he translated various other treatises in medicine, mathematics, and astronomy, to the number, it is said, of sixty-six; but some of the works with which he has been credited (including the translation of the Almansorius of Er-Razi or Rhazes) are more probably due to a later Gerard also called “Cremonensis,” but more precisely “de Sabloneta,” See Boncompagni, Della Vita e delle Opere di Gherardo Cremonense e di G her ar do da Sabbionetta.
