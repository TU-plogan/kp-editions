GILEAD (' 1 V^, i.e., “hard” or “rugged”) is sometimes used, both in earlier ancl in later writers, to denote the whole of the territory occupied by the Israelites eastward of Jordan, extending from the Arnon to the southern base of Hermon (Deut, xxxiv. 1; Judg. xx. 1; Jos., Ant. xii. 8. 3, 4). More precisely, however, it was the usual name of that mountainous district which is bounded on the N.·by the Hieromax (Yarmuk), on the E. by the Jordan, on the S. by the Arnon, and on the W. by a line which may be said to [9:10:595] follow the meridian of Amman (Philadelphia or Rabbath-Ammon). It thus lay wholly within 31° 25' and 32° 42' N. lat., and 35° 34' and 36° E. long. Excluding the narrow strip of low-lying plain along the Jordan, it has an average elevation of 2500 feet above the Mediterranean; but, as seen from the west, the relative height is very much increased by the depression of the Jordan valley. The range from the same point of view presents a singularly uniform outline, having the appearance of an unbroken wall; in reality, however, it is traversed by a number of deep ravines (wadys), of which the most important are the Yâbis, the Ajlûn, the Râjib, the Zerka (Jabbok), the Hesban, and the Zerka Main. The great mass of the Gilead range is formed of Jura limestone, but there are also occasional veins of sandstone. The eastern slopes are comparatively bare of trees; but the western are well supplied with oak, terebinth, and pine. The pastures are everywhere luxuriant, and the wooded heights and winding glens, in which the tangled shrubbery is here and there broken up by open glades and flat meadows of green turf, exhibit a beauty of vegetation such as is hardly to be seen in any other district of Palestine.

The first mention of “Mount Gilead” in Scripture occurs in Gen. xxxι., where it is said that the place where Jacob’s covenant with his father-in-law was ratified was thenceforward called “the hill of witness” ("$?£). The locality contemplated by the sacred writer was doubtless somewhere on the ridge of what is now known as Jebel Ajlûn, and probably not far from Mahneh (Mahanaim), near the head of the wady Yabis.^[1. See Beke, Notes on an Excursion to Harran,” &c., in vol. xxxii. of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society (1862). “It was not the river Jordan, but the ridge of Mount Gilead, which formed the natural boundary of the possessions of the children of Israel” ] Gilead next comes under notice in connexion with the partition of the promised land among the twelve tribes of Israel. At the period of the conquest the portion of Gilead northward of the Jabbok (Zerka) belonged to the dominions of Og, king of Bashan, while the southern half was ruled by Sihon, king of the Amorites, having been at an earlier date wrested from Moab (Numb. xxi. 24; Deut. iii. 12-16). These two sections were allotted respectively to Manasseh and to Reuben and Gad, both districts being peculiarly suited to the pastoral and nomadic character of these tribes. A somewhat wild Bedouin disposition, fostered by their surroundings, was retained by the Israelite inhabitants of Gilead to a late period of their history, and seems to be to some extent discernible in what we read alike of Jephthah, of David’s Gadites, and of the prophet Elijah.

After the close of the Old Testament history the word Gilead seldom occurs. It seems to have soon passed out of use as a precise geographical designation; for though occasionally mentioned by Apocryphal writers, by Josephus, and by Eusebius, the allusions are all vague, and show that those who made them had no definite knowledge of Gilead proper. In Josephus and the New Testament the name Peraea or πepav του , ιopδdvov is most frequently used; and the country is sometimes spoken of by Josephus as divided into small provinces called after the capitals in which Greek colonists had established themselves during the reign of the Seleucidae. At present Gilead south of the Jabbok alone is known by the name of Jebel Jilad (Mount Gilead), the northern portion between the Jabbok and the Yarmuk being called Jebel Ajlûn. Jebel Jilad includes Jebel Osha, and has for its capital the town of Es-Salt. The cities of Gilead expressly mentioned in Scripture are Ramoth, Jabesh, and Jazer. The first of these has been satisfactorily identified with Es-Salt, and apparently ought not to be regarded as distinct from Mizpeh (Judg. xi. 11, 34), called also Mιzpeh-Gιlead (Judg. χi. 29), or Ramoth Mizpeh (Josh, xiii. 26).
