GORTSCHAKOFF (Gorchakov), a noble Russian family, descended fro⅛ι Michael Vsevolodovich, prince of Chernigoff, who, in 1246, was assassinated by the Mongols. The following are the most distinguished members of this family. Petr Dimitrievich (1790-1868) served under Kamensky and Kutuzoff in the campaign against Turkey, and afterwards against France in 1813-1814. In 1820 he suppressed an insurrection in the Caucasus, for which service he was raised to the rank of major-general. In 1828-29 he fought under Wittgenstein against the Turks, occupied Aidos, and signed the treaty of peace at Adrianople. In 1839 he was made governor of eastern Siberia, andin 1851 retired into private life. When the Crimean war broke out he offered his services to the emperor Nicholas, by whom he was appointed general of the 6th army corps in the Crimea. At the battles of Alma and Inkerman he commanded the left wing of the Russian army. In 1855 he retired, and died at Moscow, March 18, 1868. Mikhail Dimitrievich (1792-1861), brother of the preceding, was born in 1792. In 1807 he entered the Russian army, in 1810 he took part in the campaigns against Persia, and in 1812-1815 against France. During the Russo-Turkish war of 1828-29, he directed the operations of the sieges of Silistria and Shumla. After being appointed, in 1830, general of artillery, he was present in the campaigns in Poland, and was wounded at the battle of Grochow, February 25, 1831. He also distinguished himself at the battle of Ostrolenka and at the taking of Warsaw. For these services he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. In 1846 he was nominated military governor of Warsaw. In 1849 he commanded the Russian artillery against the Hungarians, and in 1852 he visited London as a representative of the Russian army at the funeral of the duke of Wellington. Upon Russia declaring war against Turkey in 1853, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the troops, numbering in all some 60,000 men, which occupied Moldavia and Wallachia. On the 23d March 1854 he crossed the Danube and besieged Silistria, but was superseded in April by Prince Paskievich, who, however, resigned on the 8th of June, when Gortschakoff resumed the command. In July the siege of Silistria w as raised, and the Russian armies recrossed the Danube; in August they withdrew to Russia. In 1855 he was appointed commanderin-chief of the Russian forces in the Crimea in place of Prince Mentshikoff.
