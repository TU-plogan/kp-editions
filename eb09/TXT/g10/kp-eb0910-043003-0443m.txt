GEORGETOWN, known as Stabroek during the Dutch period, now the capital of British Guiana, is situated in the county of Demerara on the east bank of the Demerara river, about a mile from its mouth, in 6° 49' 30" N. lat. and 58° 1Γ 30" W. long. It is one of the prettiest towns of that part of the world, and presents an unusually attractive appearance to the approaching voyager. The streets are wide and straight, intersecting each other at right angles, and recalling, by the canals that run along the centre, the memory of the Dutch; and the houses are so richly embosomed by cabbage-palms, cocoa-nut trees, and other trees and shrubs, that they look rather like a collection of villas than a town. The street along the river side, where the shops and stores are mainly situated, forms, however, an exception; there everything is plain, bare, and business-like. Private dwelling-houses are usually built of wood and raised 3 or 4 feet above the soil on wooden piles or brick pillars; they are painted in various simple colours, for the most part in white; in front they have open verandahs. Among the public edifices the first place is due to a building in the centre of the town which was erected between 1829 and 1834'at a cost of £60,000, to accommodate the legislative council, the courts of justice, the custom house, the treasury, and other administrative offices; it is of considerable extent and architectural beauty, with shady porticoes and marble-paved galleries supported on cast-iron columns. Besides a cathedral, which cost £15,000, there are churches belonging to the Wesleyans, the Baptists, the London Missionary Society, and other ecclesiastical organizations, several liberally maintained hospitals, an icehouse, and two market-places[9:10:431], of which the one opened in 1844 cost £1 1,400, and tho other opened in 1852 cost £2450. The prison, a large building, or rather collection of buildings, surrounded by a strong wooden wall, can accommodate upwards of 200 prisoners. A fort, the Frederick William, situated below the town, only contains a small battery, but in the vicinity there are extensive and well-organized barracks. One of the principal disadvantages due to the position of Georgetown is the lack of drinking water; but this is so far remedied by the construction of both private and public tanks for the storage of the rain, by the introduction of water from the Lamaha creek, by a canal, and further by the boring of Artesian wells. The first attempts to apply the Artesian principle was made in 1831 by Major Staple, and his example has been widely imitated not only in the town itself but also in the surrounding country. Though the water thus obtained is strongly impregnated with iron, carbonic acid gas, salt, and magnesia, it is readily drunk by horses and cattle, and after it has been scummed and filtered it can be used for cooking. As it rises to the surface the water has a temperature of 84° Fahr., 5° higher than the water in the river. Ice is almost a necessity of life in the town, and it forms a regular import from Boston, along with fresh meat and other northern produce. The population of Georgetown in 1851 was 25,508; in 1861 it was 29,174; and by 1871 it had reached 36,562. (See Appun, Unter den Tropen, Jena, vol. ii).
