GIRVAN, a burgh of barony and market-town, in the county of Ayr, Scotland, is situated at the mouth of the river Girvan, 21 miles S.W. of Ayr, and nearly opposite Ailsa Craig, a rocky island 10 miles distant. The principal industry was formerly hand-loom weaving, but the number of persons so employed has decreased from 3000 to 300. Of late years the herring-fishing has beeu greatly developed; in the spring of 1879 304 boats were engaged in it, the “take” exceeding 20,000 crans. The harbour is a tidal one, with a depth at high water of only 9 feet. The public buildings are very superior; and of late many handsome villas have been erected. The situation of tho town is one of the finest in the west of Scotland, and the shore affords excellent facilities for sea-bathing. The population, which was 7319 in 1851, had fallen to 4776 in 1871, but it is now increasing.
