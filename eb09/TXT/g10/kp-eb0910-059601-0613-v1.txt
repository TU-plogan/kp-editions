GILGAL. Three towns of this name are mentioned in the Bible. ( 1.) The first and most important was situated “in the east border of Jericho” (Joshua iv. 19), on the border between Judah and Benjamin (Joshua xv. 7). Josephus places it 50 stadia from Jordan and 10 from Jericho (Antig., v. 1, 4), but these measurements do not agree with the position of Jericho with respect to Jordan. Jerome (Ono masticon, s.v. Galgal) places Gilgal 2 Roman miles from Jericho, and speaks of it as a deserted place held in wonderful venera tion (“miro cultu ”) by the natives. This site, which in the Middle Ages appears to have been lost,—Gilgal being shown further north,—has lately been recovered by a German traveller (Schokke), and fixed by the English survey party. It is about 2 miles east of the site of Byzantine Jericho, and 1 mile from the modern Eriha. A fine tamarisk, traces of a church (which is mentioned in the 8th century), and a large reservoir, now filled up with mud, remain. The place is called Jiljûlieh, and its position north of the valley of Achor (Wâdy Kelt) and east of Jericho agrees well with the Biblical indications above mentioned. A tradition connected with the fall of Jericho is attached to the site (see Tent JVorh in Palestine, vol. ii. p. 7). (2.) The second

Gilgal, mentioned in Joshua xii. 23 in connexion with Dor, appears to have been situated in the maritime plain. Jerome (θnomasticoη, s.v. Gelgel) speaks of a town of the name 6 Roman miles north of Antipatris (Râs el ’Ain). This is apparently the modern Kalkilia (vulgarly Galgilia), but about 3 miles north of Antipatris is a large village called Jiljûlieh, which is more probably the Biblical town. (3.) The third Gilgal (2 Kings iv. 38) was in the mountains (compare 2 Kings ii. 1-3) near Bethel. Jerome mentions this place also (Onomasticon, s.v. Galgala). It appears to be the present village of Jiljilia, about 7 English miles north of Beitin (Bethel).
