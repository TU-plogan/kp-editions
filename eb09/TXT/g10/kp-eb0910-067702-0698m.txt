GLEIG, George (1753-1839), bishop of Brechin, Scotland, was the son of a farmer, and was born at Boghall, Kincardineshire, May 12, 1753. He received his early education at the school of Arbuthnott, and at the age of thirteen entered King’s College, Aberdeen, where he especially distinguished himself in mathematics and the moral and physical sciences. In his twenty-first year he took orders in the Scottish Episcopal Church, and was ordained to the pastoral charge of a congregation at Pittenweem, Fife, whence he removed in 1790 to Stirling. His pastoral duties allowing him considerable leisure fur literary pursuits, he became a frequent contributor to the Monthly Review, the Gentleman ’ s Magazine, the Anti-Jacobin Review, and the British Critic. He also wrote several articles for the third edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and on the death of the editor, Colin Macfarquhar, in 1793, was engaged to edit the remaining volumes. One of his principal contributions to this work was the article Metaphysics. He was twice chosen bishop of Dunkeld, but the opposition of the primus rendered the election on both occasions ineffectual. In 1808 he was consecrated assistant and successor to the bishop of Brechin, in 1810 was preferred to the sole charge, and in 1816 was elected primus of the-Episcopal Church of Scotland, in which capacity he greatly aided in the introduction of many useful reforms, in fostering a more catholic and tolerant spirit, and in cementing a firm alliance with the sister church of England. He died at Stirling in February 1839.

Besides various sermons, GIeig was the author of Directions for the Study of Theology, 1827; an edition of Stackhouse’s History <f the Bible, 1817; and a life of Robertson the historian, prefixed io an edition of his works. See Life of Bishop Gleig by the Rev. W. Walker, 1879.
