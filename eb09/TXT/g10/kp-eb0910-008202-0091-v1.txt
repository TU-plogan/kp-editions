GARNIER, Marie Joseph François (1839-1873), usually called Francis Garnier, a French officer and explorer, was born at St Étienne, July 25,1839, and perished by assassination in Tong-king, December 7, 1873. He entered the navy, and after voyaging in Brazilian waters and the Pacific he obtained a post on the staff of Admiral Charner, who from 1860 to 1862 was campaigning in Cochin-China. After some time spent in France he returned to the East, and in 1862 he was appointed inspector of the natives in Cochin-China, and entrusted with the administration of the town of Cho-len or Sho-len. It was at Garnier’s suggestion that the Marquis de Chasseloup-Laubat determined to send a mission through Laos to Tibet, but as he was not considered old enough to be put in command, the chief authority was entrusted to Captain Doudart de Lagrée. In the course of the expedition—to quote the words of Sir Roderick Murchison addressed to the youthful traveller when, in 1870, he was presented with the Victoria Medal of the Royal Geographical Society of London—from Cratieh in Cambodia to Shanghai 5392 miles were traversed, and of these 3625 miles, chiefly of country unknown to European geography, were surveyed with care, and the positions fixed by astronomical observations, nearly the whole of the observations being taken by Garnier himself. Volunteering to lead a detachment to Talifu the capital of Sultan Suleiman, the sovereign of the Mahometan rebels in Yunnan, he successfully carried out the more than adventurous enterprise. When shortly afterwards Lagrée died, Gamier naturally assumed the command of the expedition, and he conducted it in safety to the Yang-tze-Kiang, and thus to the Chinese coast. On his return to France he was received with enthusiasm. The preparation of his narrative was [9:10:83] interrupted by the Franco-German war, and during the siege of Paris he served as principal staff officer to the admiral in command of the eighth “sector.” His experiences during the siege were published anonymously in the feuilleton of Le Temps, and appeared separately as Le Siege de Paris, journal Tun officier de marine, 1871. Returning to Cochin-China he found the political circumstances of the country unfavourable to further exploration, and accordingly he went to China, and in 1873 followed the upper course of the Yang·tze·Kiang to the waterfalls. He was next commissioned by Admiral Dupré, governor of Cochin-China, to Tong-king to found a French protectorate or a new colony. On November 20, 1873, he took Hanoi, the capital of Tong-king, and on December 7th he was slain.

The narrative of the principal expedition appeared in 1873, as Voyage <Γcx2>lοrαtiοη cηIηdο∙Chiηe effectui pendant les années 1866, 1867, et 1868, publié sons la direction de H. Francis Garnier, avec le contours de H. Delaporte et de HH. Joubert et Thorcl, 2 vols. An ac<Λunt of the Yang·tze·Kiang from Garnier’s pen is given in the Bulletin de la Soc. de Géog., 1874. His Chronique rogale du Cambodjc was reprinted from the Journal Asiatique in 1872. See Ocean Highways, 1874, for a memoir by Colonel Yule.
