GOLDSTÜCKER, Theodor (1821-1872), an eminent Sanskrit scholar, was born of Jewish parents at Königsberg on the 18th of January 1821, and, after passing through a prolonged course of study at the gymnasium, entered the university in 1836, where he attended the lectures of Lobeck, Rosenkranz, and Von Bohlen, under the last of whom he began the study of Sanskrit. In 1838 he removed to Bonn, where he heard W. von Schlegel, Lassen, and [9:10:765] Frey tag; and after graduating at Königsberg in 1840, lie proceeded to Paris, where he heard the lectures and enjoyed the friendship of Burnouf, and where in 1842 he edited a German translation of the Prabodha Chandrodaya. From 1846 to 1850 he resided at Berlin, where his talents and scholarship were recognized by A. von Humboldt; in the latter year he was induced, for the further prosecution of his Sanskrit researches, to remove to London, where in 1851 he was appointed professor of Sanskrit in University College. He now began to devote himself to the execution of a new Sanskrit dictionary, of which the first instalment appeared in 1856. In 1861 he published an important monograph, entitled Panini: his Place in Literature ; and from 1866 he was one of the chief promoters of the Sanskrit Text Society, which had been founded in that year; he was also an active member of the Philological Society, and of other learned bodies. His literary productiveness was not, however, proportionate to the extent and accuracy of his reading; he had “allowed his learning to stifle his creative faculty,” and a morbid dread of the risk of making inaccurate or defective statements made him unduly reluctant to communicate to the world the results of his laborious collecting and collating. The dictionary, —so copious as almost to deserve the name of a cyclopaedia of Indian archaeology,—was never advanced further than to about the middle of the first letter (1864); aud whatever else he may have written was published anonymously in various periodicals and works of reference. He died on the 6th of March 1872.
