GARCILASO INCA DE LA VEGA (1540-1616), historian of ancient Peru, was born at Cuzco in 1540. His father was a cadet of the illustrious family of La Vega, who had gone to Peru in the suite of Pedro de Alvaredo, soon after the conquests of Pizarro; his mother was of the Peruvian blood-royal, a circumstance of which he was not a little proud, as giving a right to the title which he claimed [9:10:75] by invariably subscribing himself “Inca.” In 1560 he removed to Spain, and, having entered the military service, was engaged in the wars against the Moors and Turks. Disappointed in the inadequate recognition of his services by the crown, he retired while still a young man into private life at Cordova, where he gave himself to literature, and produced the learned historical work by which he is now known, the Comentarios Reales que tratan del Origen de los Yncas, rβyes quefueron del Pera, de su Idolatria, Leyes, &c.; eon la Historia general de Pera. The first part was published in 1609, and the second within a few months of his death, which occurred in 1616. His thorough acquaintance with the language and traditions of his maternal ancestors gave his work an altogether peculiar value. It is, accordingly, the source from which all subsequent writers on the subject have most largely drawn, and still continues to be the chief original authority upon ancient Peru. An inaccurate English translation was published by Sir Paul Rycaut in 1688. There is also a French translation, which was published in 1727.
