GADIATCH, a town of Russia, at the head of a district in the government of Poltava, situated on the elevated banks of the Grun and the Psel, 73 miles N.N.W. of Poltava, in 50° 22' N. lat. and 34° 0' E. long. It is a plain wood-built town, with four Greek churches and two synagogues, deriving its main importance from its four annual fairs, one of which, lasting for three weeks, was, up to 1857, held at the Hermitage of the Transfiguration (Sheet Preobrazhenski). In 1860 the population was 7263, 1213 of the number being Jews. According to W. Struve’s Calendar for 1878, it was 8425. Gadiatch was the place where the assembly was convoked by the hetman Vigofski in 1658, for the publication of the treaty contracted between the Ukrainians and the Poles. During the hetmanate it had fortifications of which traces are still extant, rauked as a garrison town, and was the residence of the hetman. At first it was included in the military district of Luben, but after 1650 in the district to which it gave its name. Along with 13 large villages it was bestowed by the empress Elizabeth on Count Razumofski, but it was afterwards purchased from him by the empress Catharine II. In 1771 the town and district were incorporated with the province of Kieff, and in 1802 they obtained their present position in the government of Pultowa.
