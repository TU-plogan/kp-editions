GALE, Theophilus (1628-1678), a distinguished divine, was bom in 1628 at King’s Teignmouth, in Devonshire, of which place his father was vicar. In 1647 he was entered at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took his Β.Ά. degree in 1649, and Μ. A. in 1652. In 1650 he was made fellow and tutor of his college. He remained five years at Oxford, discharging actively the duties of tutor, and was then appointed to a church at Winchester. After the restoration he refused to submit to the Act of Uniformity, and was ejected from his parish. In 1662 he accepted the post of tutor to the sons of Lord Wharton, whom he accompanied to the college of Caen, in Normandy. Here-turned to England in 1665, and spent some years in literary work. The latter portion of his life he passed in London as assistant to the Rev. John Rowe, a dissenting minister, who hid charge of an important church in Holborn. Gale succeeded Rowe in 1677, and died in the following year.

His principal work, The Court of the Gentiles, which appeared in parts in 1669, 1671, and 1676, is a strange storehouse of miscellaneous philosophical learning. It resembles the Intellectual System of Cud worth, though very inferior to that work both in general construction and in fundamental idea. Gale’s endeavour is to prove that the whole philosophy of the Gentiles is a distorted or mangled reproduction of Biblical truths. Just as Cudworth referred the Democritean doctrine of atoms to Moses as the original author, so Gale tries to show that the various systems of Greek thought may he traced back to Biblical sources. Like most of the learned works of the 17th century, the Court of the Gentiles is chaotic and unsystematic, while its erudition is rendered almost valueless by the complete absence of any critical discrimination. The other writings of Gale are— The Idea of Jansenism, 1669; Theophilus, or a Discourse of the Saint’s Amity with God in Christ, 1671; Anatomy of Infidelity, 1672; Idea Theologice, 1673; Philosophia Generalis, 1676.
