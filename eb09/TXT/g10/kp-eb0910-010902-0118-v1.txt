GAUDEN, John (1605-1662), the reputed author of the Eikon Basilike, was born in 1605 at Mayfield in Essex, of which parish his father was vicar. He was educated at Bury St Edmunds, and afterwards at St John’s College, Cambridge. He obtained about 1630 the vicarage of Chippenham in Cambridgeshire, and the rectory of Brightwell in Berkshire. At the breaking out of the civil war he was domestic chaplain to Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick, one of the parliamentary leaders, and, being selected to preach before the House of Commons in 1640, was presented with a silver tankard for his discourse. In 1641 he was appointed by the parliament to the deanery of Bocking, in Essex. He became master of the Temple in 1659, in succession to Dr Ralph Brownrigg, bishop of Exeter, and after the Restoration in November 1660 was appointed to the same diocese. Between 1642, the date of his first printed work, and 1660 he published some thirteen or more books, of which number, however, only one appeared prior to the execution of the king. Soon after his appointment to the see of Exeter, he privately laid claim to the authorship of the Eikon Basilike, a work commonly attributed at the time to Charles I. This claim Gauden put forth in a correspondence with the Lord Chancellor Hyde, earl of Clarendon, and the earl of Bristol, from 21st December 1660 to 31st March 1662. The letters of Gauden among them have been published in Dr Maty’s Review in 1782, and again in the Appendix to vol. iii. of the Clarendon Papers. In the year 1693 a Mr Arthur North of London, who had married a sister of Dr Gauden’s daughter-in-law, published a series of letters which he had found among his sister-in-law’s papers, and which added materially to the strength of the bishop’s claim. They consisted of the other side of the correspondence referred to above, viz., a letter from Secretary Sir Edward Nicholas to Gaudenin January 1660-1, two from the bishop to Chancellor Hyde in December 1661 and the duke of York in January 1661—2, and onefrom Hyde to the bishop in March 1661-2. These letters, however, have been regarded with considerable suspicion by late writers on the subject, and have even been pronounced to be forgeries by some, who have pointed out that the two letters written by Gauden himself to Clarendon and the duke of York were found in the bishop’s house, not among the papers of the persons to whom they were directed. The letter also from Clarendon to Gauden, though written nine months after his obtaining his earldom, is signed Edward Hyde, a blundering anachronism which points to the unskilful hand of a forger. The whole question of the claims of Charles I. and Dr Gauden was discussed at great length and with considerable ability and ingenuity from 1824 to 1829 by Dr Christopher Wordsworth, master of Trinity College, Cambridge, on behalf of the king, and the Rev. H. J. Todd on the side of Dr Gauden. Fresh evidence, however, has lately turned up in the shape of letters and papers of Charles II. and his ministers, written soon after the execution of the king, which go far to invalidate if not entirely destroy the claim of Dr Gauden, and prove that those persons to whom he most confidently appealed in support of his pretensions were the strongest upholders of the king’s authorship at the time immediately subsequent to the appearance of the work. In 1662, on the death of Brian Duppa, bishop of Winchester, Dr Gauden applied to be translated from Exeter to that see, but his claims were set aside in favour of George Morley, bishop of Worcester, and the vacancy thus created was filled by the bishop of Exeter. He only lived four months after this last promotion, and dying on 20th September 1662, was buried in Worcester Cathedral. His will is preserved in the Prerogative Office of Canterbury.

He left a widow, the daughter of Sir William Russell of Chippenham, who after her husband’s death wrote a letter to her son John on the subject of the king’s book, and enclosed in it a narrative of the whole claim. This was published with the correspondence mentioned above by Mr North in 1693. She also erected a monument to the bishop’s memory in Worcester Cathedral, representing him with the Eikon Basilike in his hand.
