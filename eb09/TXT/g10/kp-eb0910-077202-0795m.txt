GONZAGA, or Gonzugue, an old princely family of Italy, which traces its origin to the emperor Lothair, but first came into notice in the 11th century, after the overthrow of the imperial power in Italy, where they for some time disputed the sovereignty of Mantua with the Bonacosse. The long dispute was ended by the murder of Passerine de Bonacossi in 1328, after which the Gonzaga retained possession of Mantua for four centuries. Their claims were in 1354 confirmed to Ludovico I. (1267-1360) by Louis the Bavarian, who nominated him imperial vicar, and gave him also the sovereignty of Reggio and other towns. Petrino, youngest son of Ludovico, founded the countship of Novellara, which became extinct in 1728. The elder branch of the family was continued by Guido and his son Ludovico II., who, on his death in 1382, was succeeded by his brother Francesco. He was followed in 1407 by his son Giovanni Francesco (1394-1444), on whom, for his services in the Italian wars, the emperor Sigismund in 1433 bestowed the title of marquis. Ludovico III. (1414-1478), son of the preceding, surnamed, for what reason is not quite certain, the Turk, retained a body of troops which he granted on hire to neighbouring princes. The younger sons of this Ludovico, Giovanni Francesco anrl Rudolpho, founded the dukedoms of Gabioneta and Castiglione respectively, which were confiscated in 1692. The elder branch of the family was continued by Frederick I. (1439-1484), whose son, Giovanni Francesco II. (1466-1519), was in 1494 appointed to the supreme command of the united Italian army against Charles VIII. of France, and on the 6th of July of the following year gained the victory of Fornovo, and took prisoner the bastard of Bourbon. His son, Frederick II. (1500-1540), received in 1530 the title of duke from Charles V., and in 1536 the principality of Montferrat. A younger son, Ferdinand, was the founder of the Guastella branch of the family, which became extinct in 1746. Of the succeeding members of the elder branch, the only notable one was Vincenzo I. (1562-1612), to whom the Admirable Crichton was tutor, and by whom he was murdered from jealousy in 1582. This branch became extinct in 1627 through the death of Vincenzo II., sixth successor of Frederick II. The nearest heir was Carlo I., duke of Nevers, who was recognized by the Mantuans, but his claims were contested by Ferdinand II. of Guastella, who had the support of the emperor Ferdinand II. In the war which followed, the duke of Nevers obtained the assistance of Louis XIII. of France, but in 1630 Mantua was captured and pillaged by the imperial troops, and the duke was forced to retire to the States of the Church. In 1631 a treaty was, however, concluded between France and the emperor, by which the duke, on making submission, was reinvested with the duchies of Mantua and Montferrat. Anna, a daughter of Carlo I., became wife of Edward, elector-palatine of the Rhine, and after playing a distinguished part at the French court, died at Paris in 1684, leaving behind liera volume of interesting Memoirs (London and Paris, 1686). Carlo died in 1639, and was succeeded by his grandson Carlo III., who, on his death in 1665, was succeeded by his son Carlo IV. This duke married in 1670 Anna Isabella, eldest daughter of Ferdinand duke of Guastella; and on the death of Ferdinand in 1679, he endeavoured to obtain possession of that duchy, but was compelled to relinquish his claims to Vincenzo, a cousiu-germau of the deceased duke. He took part on the side of France in the Spanish succession war, and received a French garrison into Mantua. After the defeat of the French he was placed under the ban by the emperor Joseph I., whereupon Victor Amadeus of Savoy conquered Montferrat, and Austria, in agreement with France whom Carlo bad offended, took possession of Mantua. On his death without issue in 1708, the dynasty of the Gonzagas of Mantua became extinct.
