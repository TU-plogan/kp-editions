GLUTEN, a tough, tenacious, ductile, somewhat elastic, nearly tasteless, and greyish-yellow albuminous substance, obtained from the flour of wheat by washing in water, in which it is insoluble. In Martin’s apparatus for the preparation of gluten on the large scale, balls of dough are worked backwards and forwards in troughs by means of cylinders, whilst water plays upon them in fine jets delivered by copper pipes. A sack of flouι∙ may be thus made to yield about 110 lb of moist gluten, and twice that quantity of dry starch. Good samples of white English wheat contain some 10 or 11 per cent, of gluten; from hard Venezuela wheat as much as 22 ’ 75 per cent, has been procured. The outer and inner coats of wheat, separated from it as bran, contain respectively 4 or 5 and 14 to 20 per cent, of gluten. Gluten, when dried, loses about two-thirds of its weight, becomingbrittle and semi-transparent; when strongly heated it crackles and swells, and burns like feather or horn. It is soluble in strong acetic acid, and in caustic alkalies, which latter may be used for the purification of starch in which it is present. When treated with ’ 1 to ’ 2 per cent, solution of hydrochloric acid it swells up, and at length forms a liquid resembling a solution of albumin, and laevorotatory as regards polarized light. Moistened with water and exposed to the air gluten putrefies, and evolves carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and sulphuretted hydrogen, and in the end is almost entirely resolved into a liquid, which contains leucin and ammonium phosphate and acetate. On analysis gluten shows a composition of about 53 per cent, of carbon, 7 per cent, of hydrogen, and nitrogen 15 to 18 per cent., besides oxygen, and about 1 per cent, of sulphur, and a small quantity of inorganic matter. It is uot a [9:10:696] simple substance, and according to Ritthausen consists of glutencasein (Liebig’s vegetable fibrin), glutenfibrin, gliadin (Pfianzenleim), glutin or vegetable gelatin, and mucedin, which are all closely allied to one another in chemical composition. It is the gliadin which confers upon gluten its capacity of cohering to form elastic masses, and of separating readily from associated starch. Iu the so-called gluten of the flour of barley, rye, and maize, this body is absent (Kreusler and Ritthausen). The gluten yielded by wheat which has undergone fermentation or has begun to sprout is devoid of toughness and elasticity. These qualities can be restored to it by kneading with salt, lime-water, or alum. Koopmans found that a larger amount of raw gluten was digested in a relatively dilute than in a strong artificial gastric juice, the reverse holding good of albumin. From experiments on six pigs and three dogs, he came to the conclusion that the digestive fluid in the stomachs of living animals, even of the same species, dissolves unlike quantities of albumin and gluten, so that if much albumin be digested the loss of weight of gluten present with it is but small, and vice versa (see Brit, and For. Med.-Clιir. Rev., 1857, ii. pp. 318-25). Gluten is employed in the manufacture of gluten bread and biscuits for the diabetic (see Diabetes, vol. vii. p. 148), and of chocolate, and also in the adulteration of tea and coffee. For making bread it must be used fresh, as otherwise it decomposes, and does not knead well. Granulated gluten is a kind of vermicelli, made in some starch manufactories by mixing fresh gluten with twice its weight of flour, and granulating by means of a cylinder and contained stirrer, each armed with spikes, and revolving in •opposite directions. The process is - completed by the drying and sifting of the granules.
