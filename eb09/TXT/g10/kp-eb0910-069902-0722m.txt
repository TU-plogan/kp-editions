GMELIN, Leopold (1788-1853), a celebrated chemist, was born August 2, 1788, at Göttingen, in the university of which city his father, Johann Friedrich Gmelin, was professor of medicine. He studied medicine and chemistry at Gottingen, Tiibingen, and Vienna, and in 1813 commenced lecturing on chemistry at Heidelberg, where in 1814 he was appointed extraordinary and in 1817 ordinary professor of medicine and chemistry; the latter office he held till 1850. He died at Heidelberg, April 13, 1853.

Gmelin’s fame rests chiefly on his chemical dictionary, the Handbuch der Chemie, the first edition of which, in 2 vois., was published at Frankfort in 1817-19. The fourth edition (Heidelberg, 1843, &c. ) was written by Gmelin himself as far as the end of vol. V. was continued by Drs List and Kraut and others, and completed by an eighth volume on physiological chemistry, the work of Professors[9:10:700] Lehmann and Rochleder. A revision of the Handbuch by Kraut, in two parts, has since appeared. Of the fourth edition an English translation by H. Watts was published by the Cavendish Society in 1848-59. Gιnelin was the author also of Versuch eines neuen ehem. Mincralsystems (Heidelberg, 1825), and of numerous scientific papers. With Tiedemann he wrote Versuche uber die ∏>yc auf welchem Substanzen aus dem Magen und Darrnkanale in das Blut gelangen (Heidelberg, 1820), and Die Verdauung (2 vols., Heidelberg, 1826-27).
