GLOGAU (sometimes called Gross or Great Glogau, to distinguish it from Klein or Little Glogau, in the government of Oppeln), is a fortified town of Prussia at the head of a circle in the Lower Silesian government of Liegnitz, situated partly on an island and partly on the left bank of the Oder, about 80 miles S.E. of Frankfort. Among its more important buildings are the cathedral, in the Gothic style, and a castle in the Renaissance style, now used as a courthouse; and it also possesses a new town-house, a synagogue, a poorhouse, an orphanage, a military hospital, two gymnasia, and several libraries. Situated as it is on a navigable river and at a junction of two or three railway lines, Glogau carries on an extensive trade, which is fostered by a variety of local industries, dealing with tobacco, beer, oil, sugar, vinegar, bone-meal, earthenware, &c. One of its publishing firms—that of Flemming & Company—has attained a wide reputation for maps. In 1871 the population of Glogau, inclusive of the garrison, amounted to 18,266,— of whom 6039 were Roman Catholics and 947 Jews; and in 1875 it was stated at 18,062.

In the beginning of the 11th century Glogau, even then a populous and fortified town, was able to withstand a regular siege by the emperor Henry V.; but in 1157 the duke of Silesia, finding he could not hold out against Frederick Barbarossa, set the place on fire. In 1252 the town, which had been raised from its ashes by Henry the Bearded, became the capital of a principality of Glogau, which continued till 1506, when town and district were united to the Bohemian crown. In the course of the Thirty Years’ War Glogau suffered greatly. The inhabitants, who had become Protestants soon after the Reformation, were dragooned into conformity by Wallenstein’s soldiery; and the Jesuits received permission to build themselves a church and a college. Captured by the Protestant allies in 1632, and recovered by the Imperialists in 1633, the town was again captured by the Swedish general Torstenson in 1642, and continued in Protestant hands till the peace of Westphalia in 164S. In 1741 the Prussians took the place by storm, and during the Seven Years’ War it formed an important centre of operations for the Prussian forces. After the battle of Jena it fell into the hands of the French; and they have reason to be proud of the gallant defence made by Laplane, who held out against the Russian and Prussian besiegers, after the battle of Katzbacb. (August 26, 1813), till the 17th of the following April.
