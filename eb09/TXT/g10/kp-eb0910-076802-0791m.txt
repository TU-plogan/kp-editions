GOLIÜS, Jacobus (1596-1667), Orientalist, was born at the Hague in 1596, and studied at Leyden, where in Oriental languages he was the most distinguished pupil of Erpenius. In 1622 he accompanied the Dutch embassy to Morocco, and on his return he was chosen to succeed Erpenius (1624). In the following year he set out on a Syrian and Arabian tour from which he did not return until 1629. The remainder of his life was spent at Leyden where from that date he held the chair of mathematics as well as that of Arabic until his death, which occurred on September 28th, 1667.

His most important work is the Lexicon Arabico-Latinum, fol., Leyden 1653, which, based on the Sihah of Al-Jauhari, has only recently been superseded by the corresponding work of Frey tag. Among his earlier publications may be mentioned editions of various Arabic texts {Proverbia quoedam Alis, imperatoris Muslemici, et Carmen Tograi, pociae doctissimi, necnon dissertatio quoedam Abcn Synoe, 1629; and Ahmcdis Arabsiadoe vitoe et rerum gestarum Timuri, qui vulgo Tamerlancs dicitur, historia, 1636). In 1656 he published a new edition, with considerable additions, of the Grammatica Arabica of Erpenius. After his death, there was found among his papers a Z‰Zionαriwwι Persico-Latinum which was published, with additions, by Edmund Castell in his Lexicon Heptaglotton (1669). Golius also edited, translated, and annotated the astronomical treatise of Alfragan {Muhammedis, filii Kctiri Fer- ganensis, qui vulgo Alfraganus dicitur, Elementa Astronomica Arabice et Latine, 1669).
