GALATIA, afterwards called also Gallo-Gkaecia, in ancient geography, an inland division of Asia Minor, bounded on the N. by Bithynia and Paphlagonia, E. by Pontus, S. by Cappadocia and Lycaonia, W. by Phrygia. These boundaries, however, varied at different periods in the history of Galatia. The river Halys flowed in a northerly direction through the centre of the province, the eastern half of which was watered by tributaries of that stream, while the Sangarius and its affluents traversed the western half.

Galatia originally formed a part of the extensive province of Phrygia; after its separation it was occupied by three Gallic tribes, who still continued distinct in the time of Strabo—the Trocmi, who dwelt in the east, the Tectosages in the centre, and the Tolistobogii in the west. Each of these tribes was subdivided into four parts, and these were ruled over each by a tetrarch of its own. The power of the tetrarchs was limited by a senate of 300, before which [9:10:19] also all capital cases were tried. Minor offences came under the cognizance of the tetrarchs and special judges appointed by them. The three tribes all spoke the same tongue; and though in course of time they became Hellenized, their original language was still in use among them as late as the time of Jerome.

The physical characters of Galatia are in great measure similar to those of the adjoining provinces of Phrygia and Lycaonia, the whole region being an elevated plateau or table-land, no part of which is less than 2000 feet above the sea, while the greater part exceeds 3000 feet in elevation. The southern portion, towards Lycaonia, is the most level, and is an alm03t perfect plain, passing gradually into the expanse of salt desert which occupies the frontier lands of the two provinces. The rest of the country consists for the most part of vast undulating downs, affording excellent pasture for sheep and goats, and capable of producing good crops of corn, though at present in great part uncultivated, and almost wholly devoid of wood. Towards the frontiers of Bithynia it becomes more broken, and is intersected by numerous valleys, as well as by several detached ranges of hills, none of them, however, attaining to any considerable height or importance. The lofty range of the Ala-dagh (6000-7000 feet), though frequently termed the Galatian Olympus, is not properly included within the limits of the province, but forms in part the natural boundary which separates it from Bithynia, From its elevated position, the climate of Galatia is naturally one of considerable extremes of heat and cold; and while the summers are burning hot, the winters at Angora are more severe than at Paris, and the snow often lies on the ground for a month together.

The only towns of importance in Galatia were Tavium, the capital of the Trocmi, a small town which speedily fell into decay; Ancyra, the capital of the Tectosages, which under the Romans became the capital of the country, and has ever since retained its importance as one of the principal citiee of Asia Minor (see Angora) ; and Pessinus, the chief town of the Tolistobogii, where a splendid temple was consecrated to Agdistis, the mother of the gods, the divinity who was worshipped at Rome under the title of Rhea or Cybele.

Galatia took its name from a body of Gauls who invaded Asia Minor about the year 277 B.c. They had formed part of the army which invaded Greece under Brennus, but having quarrelled with that commander, had left his standard, and marching into Thrace under generals of their own choice, advanced to Byzantium, whence they were invited by Nicomedes, king of Bithynia, to cross into Asia, and help him in his struggle against his brother Zipøetes. After performing the required services, they turned their arms against their employer, and ravaged the western half of Asia Minor. Their success allured other hordes of their countrymen, who readily took service with the Asiatic kings in their ware against each other. No Oriental prince was found able to check them, until Attalus, king of Pergamus, defeated them in a great battle, 239 b. c., and compelled them to settle in that part of the country which after them was called Galatia. They still remained independent, however, and proved a formidable foe to the Romans in their ware with Antiochus. It was found necessary to direct a special army against them, under Cn. Manlius, and the result of the campaign (189 b.c.) was their complete subjugation to the power of Rome. Galatia was not at this time reduced to a Roman province, but the Gauls were still allowed to retain their own government under their tetrarchs. This system, however, gradually gave way, and the whole country passed under the authority of one ruler. The first of these sole tetrarchs was Dciotarus, a contemporary of Cicero and Caesar, who, in return for the assistance which he gave the Romans in their wars against Mithridates, was rewarded with a part of Pontus and Armenia Minor, and was styled king by the senate. It was afterwards united with Lycaonia, Isauria, and several adjoining districts, under a king named Amyntas, at whose death, in 25 b.c., Galatia became a Roman province. Theodosius the Great subdivided it for purposes of government into Galatia Prima, of which Ancyra was the capital, and Galatia Secunda, with Pessinus for its chief town.

The antiquities of Galatia have in recent times been made the subject of special investigation by a French commission composed of MM. Perrot, Guillaume, and Delbet, and the result of their labours published in 2 vols, fol., Paris, 1872; but with the exception of those of Angora, they are not of much general interest.
