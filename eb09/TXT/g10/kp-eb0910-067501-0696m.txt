GLATZ (Slav. Kladsko), a fortified town of Prussian Silesia, chief town of a countship in the government district of Breslau, is situated 50 miles S.S.W. of the town of that name. It stands in a narrow valley on the left bank of the Neisse, not far from the Austrian frontier. It is strongly walled, and is further defended by an old castle built on a high hill on one side of the town, and by a regular modern fortress erected on a hill on the opposite side. Before the town on both banks of the river there is also a strongly fortified camp, by which its bombardment from the neighbouring heights may be hindered, and which affords accommodation for as many as 10,000 men. The town is the seat of a circle court and of an agricultural union, and possesses one Lutheran and three Catholic churches, one of which is very old and contains several monuments of Silesian dukes. Among the other buildings the principal are the nunnery, the royal Catholic gymnasium, the asylum for destitute children, and the military hospital. The industries include the manufacture of spirits, linen, damask, broad cloth, hosiery, beads, and leather. Glatz existed as early as the 11th century. In the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War it was several times besieged and taken. It surrendered to Frederick the Great in 1742, was retaken by the Austrians in 1760, and was restored to Prussia at the peace of 1763. The population in 1875 was 12,553.
