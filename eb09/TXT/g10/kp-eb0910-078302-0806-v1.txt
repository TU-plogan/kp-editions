+=====================================================================+


GORE, Mrs Catherine Grace (1799-1861), an exceedingly prolific English novelist, was born in 1799 at East Retford, Nottinghamshire, and was the daughter of Mr Moody, a wine-merchant. In 1823 she was married to Captain Charles Gore; and, in the same year, she published her first work, Theresa Marchmont, or the Maid of Honour. Then followed, in rapid succession, the Lettre de Cachet and The Reign of Terror (1827), Hungarian Tales, Manners of the Day (1830), Mothers and Daughters (1831), and The Pair of May Pair (1832). At this point the critics began to say that Mrs Gore had written enough; and she accordingly went to France to extend her range of observation, and did not publish till 1836, when her next novel, entitled Mrs Armytage, appeared. Every succeeding year saw several volumes from her pen; and in 1839 The Cabinet Minister, Preferment, and The Courtier of the Days of Charles II. were issued from the press. But in 1841 Mrs Gore fairly eclipsed her other novels by the publication of Cecil, or the Adventures of a Coxcomb, which produced a great sensation. This year also appeared Greville, or a Season in Paris. Then followed, in 1842, Ormiηgton, or Cecil a Peer, Pαsciηαtioη, and The Ambassador’s Wife ; and in 1843 Mrs Gore produced another masterpiece, entitled The Banker’s Wife. She continued to write, with unfailing fertility of invention, till her death in January 1861. Mrs Gore also published some dramas and translations from the French; but it is as a fashionable novelist that she is remembered. Her life was one of extraordinary literary industry, as may be inferred from the fact that she is the author of more than seventy distinct works. Among her best novels are Cecil, or the Adventures of a Coxcomb, Greville, and The Banker's Wife. Cecil gives extremely vivid sketches of London fashionable life, and is full of happy epigrammatic touches. It displays great knowledge of London clubs, for which Mrs Gore was indebted to Mr Beckford, the author of Vathek. The narrative is varied by occasional glimpses of Continental life. Greville is marked by faithful pictures of English country life, and of the ease and grace of French society. The Banker’s Wife is distinguished for masterly studies of character, especially in the persons of Mr Hamlyn, the cold calculating moneymaker, and his warm-hearted country neighbour, Colonel Hamilton.

Mrs Gore’s works are characterized by great cleverness in invention, lively satire, shrewd insight into character, and keen observation of life. They are exceedingly deficient in feeling; and the lover of fiction passes a pleasant hour [9:10:784] or two over her novels, not much excited by the triumphs, or vexed by the sufferings of her characters. Sometimes her novels weary the reader; but this does not arise from any failiug in her style, which is always clear, animated, and full of point, nor from lack of inventiveness, but from the endless repetitions involved in writing so many books on a subject of such comparatively limited range as fashionable life. Mrs Gore’s novels have not only achieved an immense temporary popularity, but possess genuine historic value as eminently readable, and on the whole faithful, pictures of the life and pursuits of the English upper classes.
