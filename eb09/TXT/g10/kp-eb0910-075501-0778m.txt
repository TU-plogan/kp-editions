GOLDBERG, a town in the Prussian province of Silesia, capital of a circle in the government district of Liegnitz, is situated 14 miles S.W. of that town, on the Katzbach, an affluent of the Oder. The principal buildings are an old church dating from the beginning of the 13th century, the Schwabe-Priesemuth institution, completedin 1876, for the board and education of orphans, and the gymnasium, which in the 17th century enjoyed great prosperity, and numbered Wallenstein among its pupils. The chief manufactures are woollen cloth, flannel, gloves, stockings, leather, and beer, and there is a considerable trade in corn and fruit. Goldberg owes its origin and name to a gold mine in the neighbourhood, which, however, has been wholly abandoned since the time of the Hussite wars. Population (1875), 6492.

The town .suffered heavily from the Tartars in 1241, from the plague in 1334, from the Hussites in 1428, and from the Saxon, imperial, and Swedish forces during the Thirty Years’ War. On 27th May 1813 a battle took place near it between the French under Macdonald and the rear guard of the Russians under Wittgenstein; and on the 23d August of the same year a skirmish, in which Macdonald suffered defeat from the Prussians under Blücher.
