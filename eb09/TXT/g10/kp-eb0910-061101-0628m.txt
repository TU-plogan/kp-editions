GIOVINAZZO, a town of Italy, in the province of Bari, about 11 miles from Bari, on the railway from Otranto to Bologna. Situated on the coast, it has a small harbour, and carries on an export trade in the olives, almonds, and carobs produced in the vicinity. It is also the seat of a bishop, and possesses a cathedral, a castle, and a famous ospizio or poorhouse, which was founded by Ferdinand I. of Naples, and is now used partly for the education of foundlings and orphans, and partly for the reformatory treatment of juvenile criminals. Cloth, carpets, thread, and shoes are among the manufactures of the place, and the children of the ospizio are largely trained in such industries. Whether the identification with the ancient town called Netium or Natiolum be well founded or not, it is certain that Giovinazzo was in existence at a very early date, and some portions of its seawall are supposed to belong to the later Roman period. The population of the town in 1875 was 8902, and of the commune 9108.
