GODÂVARI, a district of Madras presidency, British India, lying between 16° 15' and 17° 35' N. lat., and between 80° 55' and 82° 38' E. long.; and bounded N. by the Central Provinces and Vizagapatam district, E. by Vizagapatam and the Bay of Bengal, S. by the Bay of Bengal and Kistna district, and W. by the Nizâm’s dominions. The district is divided by the Godâvari river into two nearly equal parts. The scenery along the course of the river is varied and striking. The only lake of importance is the Koléru, which is studded with islands and fishing villages. Building stone and limestone are abundant in the uplands. Iron is also found. The jungle products are myrobalans, soap-nuts, tamarinds, bamboorice, honey, and beeswax. Wild animals and game birds are numerous.

The population in 1871 numbered 1 592,939 (803,603 males, 789,336 females), showing a considerable increase on foιmer years. The Hindus numbeιed 1,555.981, the Mahometans 35,173, the Christians 1483 (Protestants and Boman Catholies in nearly equal numbers); 39 were Buddhists, and 263 not separately classified. Nineteen towns each contain upwards of 5000 inhabitants,—the aggregate population of the three chief towns, Ellor, Rajahmandri, and Cocanada, being 63,064.

The total area of the district is 7345 square miles, of which 2713 square miles belong to Government. Of Government land, 386,400 acresaτe under cultivation; the rest either belongs to the zarnindüri estates,or is waste and uncultivable. The chief productsare rice,gram, jute, hemp, gingelly, tobacco, sugar-cane, and indigo; lice and food grains have improved in quality owing to the extension of irrigation by canals. Government tenants have permanent right of occupancy so long as they pay the Government demand, while on the zarnindüri estates cultivators are merely yearly tenants. The district is well supplied with means of communication by 491 miles of good road and 431 miles of canals. The principal manufactures are cotton and woollen carpets, sheep wool blankets, uppada cloths, sugar, and indigo. The chief articles of trade are grain, cotton, jaggery, turmeric, cocoa-nut, flax-cloth, onions, garlic, lace cloths, tobacco, gingelly seed, lamp-oil, salt, tamarinds, cattle, teakwood, skills, opium, and indigo. Cocanada, Ellor, Rajahmandri, Mandapetta, Jaggampetta, Husanbada, Nasapur, Palakollu, Dowlaishvaram, Ambajipetta, and Jagannathpur are the most important seats of commerce. The estimated value of imports in 1874-75 was £204,238, and of exports, £903,253. The total revenue in 1875-76 was £558,812; the expendituιe, £28,604; the total municipal income, £5152. There are 28 magisterial and 15 revenue and civil courts. There are 387 schools, attended by 7759 pupils. The administrative headquarters is at Cocanada. The prevailing epidemic diseases are beri-bcri and fevers; cholera and small-pox occur during the hot season, but only the poorer classes are attacked. Cattle diseases also prevail. The average annual rainfall from 1871 to 1875 was 43'35 inches; the average mean temperature at Rajahmandri in 1876 was 82 ’ 7° Fahr. Two severe storms, which caused great destruction to property, occurred in 1832 and 1839.

The Godâvari district formed part of the Andhra division of [9:10:715] Dravida, the north-west portion being subject to the Orissa kings, and the south-western belonging to the Vengi kingdom. For centuries it was the battlefield on which various chiefs fought for independence with varying success till the beginning of the 16th century, when the whole country may be said to have passed under Mahometan power. At the conclusion of the struggle with the French in the Carnatic, Godavari with the Circars was ceded to the English by the nawàb, and finally confirmed by the imperial sanad in 1765. The present district was constituted in 1859, by the redistribution of the territory comprising the former districts of Guntoor, Rajahmandri, and Masulipatam, into what are now the Kistna and Godavari districts.
