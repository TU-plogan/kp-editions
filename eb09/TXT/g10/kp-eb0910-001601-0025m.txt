GAISSIN, Gaicyn, or Haiscix, a town of Russia, at the head of a district in Podolia, 178 miles E. of Kamenetz Podolski or Podoliau Kamenetz, in 48° 39' N. lat. and 29° 23' E. long., near the river Sop, a tributary of the Bug. With few exceptions, the houses are built of wood, and the inhabitants are mainly supported by agriculture. Among the public buildings are an orthodox church, a synagogue and four Jewish chapels, and a town hospital. In 1860 the population was 10,106, of whom 1863 were Jews. In the St Petersburg Calendar for 1878 the total is given as 9417. Gaissin dates from about 1600: in one of the Acts of 1615 it is stated that Heyszyn or Gaissin was founded with royal privilege by the ban Swierski about 15 years before. In 1659 King John Casimir of Poland bestowed it on Maximus Buliga the Zaporogian chief. It obtained Magdeburg rights in 1744 or 1745; and in 1796, after the incorporation of Podolia with Russia, it was made a district town.
