GOLDBEATING. The art of goldbeating is of great antiquity, being referred to by Horner; and Pliny states that one ounce of gold was extended to 750 leaves, each leaf being four fingers square, which is three times the thickness of the ordinary leaf gold of the present time. In all probability the art originated among Oriental communities, where the working of gold and the use of gold ornaments have been distinguishing characteristics from the most remote periods; and in India goldbeating is still carried on as a craft involving many mysteries and great difficulties. On the coffins of the Theban mummies specimens of original leaf-gilding are met with, where the gold is in so thin a state that it resembles modern gilding. The Incas of Peru do not appear to have been able to reduce gold further than to plates which could be nailed for ornamentation on the walls of their temples. In England goldbeating was confined to London until within the present century. It was introduced into Scotland and the United States within that period, and it is now practised in most towns of any considerable size; but so far as concerns Great Britain it is principally centred in London. One grain of gold has been beaten out to the extent of 75 square inches, and the same weight of silver to 98 square inches. Taking a cubic inch of gold at 4900 grains, this gold-leaf is the 367,650th part of an inch in thickness, or about 1200 times thinner than ordinary printing paper. The silver, though spread over a larger surface, was thicker, owing to the difference in its specific gravity; but, calculated by weight, silver is the most malleable metal with which we are acquainted, in that respect considerably exceeding gold. This experiment does not, however, determine the extent of the malleability of either metal, as the means employed to test it were found to fail before there was any appearance of the malleability of the metals [9:10:753] being exhausted. In practice the average degree of tenuity to which the gold is reduced is not nearly so great as the example above quoted. A “book of gold” containing 25 leaves measuring each 3∣ inches, equal to an area of 264 square inches, generally weighs from 4 to 5 grains.

The gold used by the goldbeater is variously alloyed, according to the variety of colour required. Fine gold is commonly supposed to be incapable of being reduced to thin leaves. This, however, is not the case, although its use for ordinary purposes is undesirable on account of its greater cost. It also adheres on one part of a leaf touching another, thus causing a waste of labour by the leaves being spoiled; but for work exposed to the weather it is much preferable, as it is more durable, and does not tarnish or change colour. The external gilding on many public buildings, such, e.g., as the Albert Memorial in Hyde Park, London, is done with pure gold. The following is a list of the principal classes of leaf recognized and ordinarily prepared by British beaters, with the proportions of alloy per ounce they contain.

The process of goldbeating is thus conducted. The gold, having been alloyed according to the colour desired, is melted in a crucible, at a higher temperature than is simply necessary to fuse it, as its malleability is improved by exposure to a greater heat; sudden cooling does not interfere with its malleable properties, gold differing in this respect from some other metals. It is then cast into an ingot, and flattened, by rolling between a pair of powerful smooth steel rollers, into a ribbon of 1⅛ inch wide and 10 feet in length to the ounce. After being flattened it is annealed and cut into pieces of about 6⅜ grs. each, or about 75 per ounce, and placed between the leaves of a “cutch,” which is about half an inch thick and 3⅛ inches square, containing about 180 leaves of a tough paper manufactured in France. Formerly fine vellum was used for this purpose, and generally still it is interleaved in the proportion of about one of vellum to six of paper. The cutch is beaten on for about 20 minutes with a 17-pound hammer, which rebounds by the elasticity of the skin, and saves the labour of lifting, by which the gold is spread to the size of the cutch; each leaf is then taken out, and cut into four pieces, and put between the skins of a “shoder,” 4⅛ inches square and ∣ths of an inch thick, containing about 720 skins, which have been worn out in the finishing or “mould” process. The shoder requires about two hours’ beating upon with a 9-pound hammer. As the gold will spread unequally, the shoder is beaten upon after the larger leaves have reached the edges. The effect of this is that the margins of larger leaves come out of the edges in a state of dust. This allows time for the smaller leaves to reach the full size of the shoder, thus producing a general evenness of size in the leaves. Each leaf is again cut into four pieces, and placed between the leaves of a “mould,” composed of about 950 of the finest gold-beaters’ skins, five inches square and three-quarters of an inch thick, the contents of one shoder filling three moulds. The material has now reached the last and most difficult stage of the process; and on the fineness of the skin and judgment of the workman the perfection and thinness of the leaf of gold depend. During the first hour the hammer is allowed to fall principally upon the centre of the mould. This causes gaping cracks upon the edges of the leaves, the sides of which readily coalesce and unite without leaving any trace of the union after being beaten upon. At the second hour, when the gold is about the 150,000th part of an inch in thickness, it for the first time permits the transmission of the rays of light. In pure gold, or gold but slightly alloyed, the green rays are transmitted; and in gold highly alloyed with silver, the pale violet rays pass. The mould requires in all about four hours’ beating with a 7-pound hammer, when the ordinary thinness for the gold leaf of commerce will be reached. A single ounce of gold will at this stage be extended to 75×4× 4 = 1200 leaves, which will trim to squares of about 3∣ inches each. The finished leaf is then taken out of the mould, and the rough edges are trimmed off by slips of the ratan fixed in parallel grooves of an instrument called a waggon, the leaf being laid upon a leathern cushion for that purpose. The sizes to which British leaf .is cut are 3, 3⅛, 3∣, 3g, and 3⅛ inches. The leaves thus prepared are placed into “books” capable of holding 25 leaves each, which have been nibbed over with red ochre to prevent the gold clinging to the paper. The leaf is used for gilding picture frames, and for other ornamental purposes. See Gilding.

The fine membrane called goldbeaters’ skin, used for making up the shoder and mould, is the outer coat of the caecum or blind gut of the ox. It is stripped off in lengths about 25 or 30 inches, and freed from fat by dipping in a potash solution and scraping with a blunt knife. It is afterwards stretched on a frame; two membranes are glued together, treated with a solution of aromatic substances or camphor in isinglass, and subsequently coated with white of egg. Finally they are cut into squares of 5 or 5^ inches; and to make up a mould of 950 pieces the gut of about 380 oxen is required, about 2∣ skins being got from each animal. A skin will endure about 200 beatings in the mould, after which it is fit for use in the shoder alone.

The dryness of the cutch, shoder, and mould is a matter of extreme delicacy. They require to be hot-pressed every time they are used, although they may be used daily, to remove the moisture which they acquire from the atmosphere, except in extremely frosty weather, when they acquire so little moisture that then a difficulty arises from their over-dryness, whereby the brilliancy of the gold is diminished, and it spreads very slowly under the hammer. On the contrary, if the cutch or shoder be damp, the gold will become that which is technically termed hollow or sieve-like; that is, it is pierced with innumerable microscopical holes; and in the moulds in its more attenuated state it will become reduced to a pulverulent state. This condition is more readily produced in alloyed golds than in fine gold. It is necessary that each skin of the mould should be rubbed over with calcined gypsum (the fibrinated variety) each time the mould may be used, in order to prevent the adhesion of the gold to the surface of the skin in beating. Dentist gold is gold leaf carried no further than the cutch stage, and should be perfectly pure gold.

By the above process also silver is beaten, but not so thin, the inferior value of the metal not rendering it commercially desirable to bestow so much labour upon it. Copper, tin, zinc, palladium, lead, cadmium, platinum, and aluminium can be beaten into thin leaves, but not to the same extent as gold or silver.
