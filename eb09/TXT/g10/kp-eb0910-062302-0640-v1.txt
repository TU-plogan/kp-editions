GIRGENTI, a city in the south of Sicily, at the head of a province of its own name, occupies a fine position about 3 miles from the coast on a platform of Mount Camicus, more than 1100 feet above the level of the sea. It lies about 60 miles S.S.E. of Palermo, with which it is connected by a railway 90 miles long. As seen from the lower ground Girgenti presents a grandiose but sombre appearance, with its buildings rising in close array from ancient substructions and the steep rocks of the mountain; but within it is for the most part mean, monotonous, and melancholy, the streets with few exceptions being confined, irregular, steep, and ill-paved, and the houses all presenting the same greybrown walls, the same reddish roofs, and the same narrow doors and narrow windows. The cathedral, begun in the 14th century, has still an impressive effect, in spite of the incongruous mixture of styles; but the interior is a typical specimen of modern rococo. The acoustic conditions are sufficiently peculiar: a word spoken in the softest whisper at the entrance can be distinctly heard behind the choir, 100 paces off. One of the chapels contains the shrine and bears the name of St Gerlando, the first bishop of Girgenti; the altar-piece is a Virgin and Child by Guido Reni; and in the north aisle there stands a marble sarcophagus now used as a font, with fine rilievos, probably of Roman workmanship after a Greek original, representing the story of Hippolytus and Phaedra. Not only are the archives of the cathedral rich in historic documents of the Norman period, but they profess to contain an autograph letter of the devil himself. Among the other churches, upwards of forty in number, S. Maria dei Greci is worthy of note as preserving two Doric pillars which had belonged to the temple of Zeus Polieus, founded in 570 B.c. by Phalaris, and are thus the oldest architectural remains in Girgenti. As the chief town of a province, Girgenti is the residence of a prefect and the military headquarters of the district. It is also the seat of the wealthiest bishopric in Sicily, dating from the pontificate of Urban II.; and it possesses a chamber of commerce and art, an industrial institute, a lyceum, a gymnasium, a technical school, and an episcopal seminary. Its principal library, Bibliotheca Lucchesiana. was presented to the town by Don Andrea Lucchese of the family of Campo Franco; the Casino Empedocleo, with well-appointed library and readingrooms, was founded by a number of the wealthier citizens. In the early part of the century Girgenti was a poverty-stricken town, but it has attained a considerable degree of prosperity since 18o0. It lies in the centre of the sulphur district of Sicily, and its port, formerly Molo di Girgenti, now Porto Empedocle, is the principal place of shipment. The harbour has been largely improved since 1870: the pier, originally constructed in the 17th century, in part at least from the ruins of the temple of the Olympian Jupiter, has been extended to a length of 4800 feet, so as to include an area of 330,000 square yards, and the depth, which was only 10 feet on the bar and 16 within, has been greatly increased by dredging. Around the port, which is 3 miles from the city proper, has gathered a cluster of houses and stores, and the spot is defended by a small fort. Almonds and grain are the only important articles of export besides sulphur; but, though the grain-pits hewn out of the rock are of large extent, the actual shipments of grain are not very great. The average value of the annual export of sulphur amounted, between 1868 and 1870, to £411,700, while that of the other articles was less than £ 15,000 each. The population of Girgenti was 18,802 in 1871, and that of Porto Empedocle 6691. In the history of Girgenti there is little of note; the historical interest of the district gathers round the splendid ruins of the older Agrigentum, which lie between Girgenti and the sea.
