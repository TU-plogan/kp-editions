GLOSS, GLOSSOGRAPHER, GLOSSARY, GLOSSATOR. The Greek word γλώσσα, meaning originally a tongue, hence a language or dialect, gradually came to denote especially any obsolete, foreign, provincial, technical, or otherwise peculiar word or use of a word (see Arist., Ehet. iii. 3, 2); and the making of collections and explanations of such γλώσσαι was at a comparatively early date a well-recognized form of literary activity. Even in the 5th century, among the many writings of Democritus of Abdera was included a treatise entitled Περί Όμηρου η opθoeπciης κdi γλωσσεωr. It was not, however, until the Alexandrian period that the γλωσσογράφοι became very numerous. Of many of these it is probable that even the names have perished; but in the writings of Athenaeus alone (c. 250 a.d.) allusions are to be found to no fewer than thirty-five. Among the earliest may be mentioned Philetas of Cos (d. c. 290 b.c. ),the elegiac poet, to whom Aristarchus dedicated the treatise πpoςΦιλητaw, he was the compiler of a lexicographical work, arranged probably according to subjects, and entitled "Ατακτα or Γλώσσαι (sometimes άτακτοι γλώσσαι). Next came his disciple Zenodotus of Ephesus (c. 280 b.c. ), one of the earliest of the Homeric critics and the compiler of ΡλωσσαιΌμηρικαί; Zenodotus in turn was succeeded by his greater pupil Aristophanes of Byzantium (c. 200 b.c.), whose great compilation 7r∈pι λeξeωv (still partially preserved in that of Pollux), is known to have included Αττικαι λiξeις, Aaκωvικdi γλωσσaι, and the like. From the school of Aristophanes issued more than one glossographer of name,—Diodorus, Artemidorus (γλώσσαι, and a collection of λ∈⅛eιs δψaρτυτικai), Nicander of Colophon (γλώσσαι, of which some twenty-six fragments still survive), and Aristarchus, the famous critic, whose numerous labours included an arrangment of the Homeric vocabulary (λεξuς) in the order of the books. Contemporary with the last named was Crates of Mallos, who, besides making some new contributions to Greek lexicography and dialectology, was the first to create at Rome a taste for similar investigations in connexion with the Latin idioms. From his school proceeded Zenodotus of Kfallos, the compiler of ’ E⅛ικαι λε'^εις or γλώσσαι, a work said to have been designed chiefly to support the views of the school of Pergamus as to the allegorical interpretation of Homer. 1 Of later date were Didymus (Chalkenteros, c. 50 b.c. ), who made collections of λε'ςεις τpαγωδoυ∕zεVαι, κωμικai, &C.; Apollonius Sophista (c. 20 b.c. ), whose Homeric Lexicon has come down to modern times; and Neoptolemus, known distinctively as ό γλωσσογράφος. Coming down to the beginning of the first century of the Christian era we find Apion, a grammarian and rhetorician at Rome during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius, following up the labours of Aristarchus and other predecessors with γλώσσαι Όμηρικαί, and a treatise περί της 'Ρωμαϊκής διαλέκτου ; Heliodorus or Herodorus was another almost contemporary glossographer; Erotian also, during the reign of Nero, prepared a special glossary for the writings of Hippocrates, still preserved. To this period also Pamphilus, the author of the λειμών, from which Diogenian and Julius Vestinus afterwards drew so largely, most probably belonged. In the following century one of the most prominent workers in this department of literature was Aelius Herodianus, whose treatise 7τ∈pι μονήρους λέξεως has been edited in modern times, and whose ιπιμepισμοl we still possess in an abridgment; other names are those of Pollux, of Diogenian (λέξις πavτoδaπη), of Julius Vestinus (επιτομή των Tiaμφiλου γλωσσών), and especially that of Phrynichus, who flourished towards the close of the 2d century. His Eclogce nominum et verborum Atticorum has frequently been edited. To the 4th century belongs Ammonius of Alexandria (c. 389), who wrote περί όμοιων και διαφόρων λέξεων, a dictionary of words used in senses different from those in which they had been employed by older and approved writers. Of somewhat later date is the well-known Hesychius, whose often-edited Αεξικόν rightly superseded all previous works of the kind; Cyril, the celebrated patriarch of Alexandria, also contributed somewhat to the advancement of glossography by his συναγωγή των προς διάφορον σημασίαν διαφόρως τονουμένων λέξεων; the names of Orus and Orion, of Philoxenus, and of the two Philemons also belong to this period. The works of Photius, Suidas, and Zonaras, as also the Etymologicum Magnum, to which might be added the Lexica Sanger-mansia and the Lexica Seguemana, have already been referred to (Dictionary, vol. vii. p. 183). In Latin lexicology the most prominent name is that of Festus, whose only extant work, however, is but an epitome of the treatise of Verrius Flaccus De Verborum Significatu. This last-named author had himself been preceded by Varro (De Lingua Latina), who in turn makes allusion to several before him “qui glossas scripserunt.” The introduction of grammatical and linguistic studies into Rome is usually attributed to Crates of Mallos (c. 267 b.c.) mentioned above.

To a special category of technical glossaries belongs a large and important class of works relating to the lawcompilations of Justinian. Although the emperor forbade under severe penalties all commentaries (υπομνήματα) on his legislation (Const. Deo Auctore, sec. 12; Const. Tanta, sec. 21), yet indices (*Ivδικες) and references (παράτιτλα), as well as translations (ερμηνείαι κατά πόδα) and paraphrases (ερμηνείαι εις πλάτος), were expressly permitted, and lavishly produced. Among the numerous compilers of alphabetically arranged λεfεις 'Pωμdiκai or Aaτειvικai. and γλώσσαι νομικαί (Glossae nomicae), Cyril and Philoxenus are particularly noted; but the authors of πapaγρaφai, oτ σημειώσεις, whether έξωθεν OΓ εσωθεv κεiμεvaι, are too numerous to mention. A collection of these πapaγpaφai των παλαιών, combined with vεαι πaρaγpaφai on the revised code called τα βασιλικά, was made about the middle of the 12th century by a disciple of Michael Hagiotheodorita. This work is known as the Glossa Ordinaria των βασιλικών. 2

In Italy also, during the period of the Byzantine ascendency, various glossae (glosae) and scholia on the Justinian code were produced; 3 particularly the Turin gloss (reprinted by Savigny), to which, apart from later additions, a date prior to 1000 is usually assigned. After the total extinction of the Byzantine authority in the West the study of law became one of the free arts, and numerous schools for its cultivation were instituted. Among the earliest of these was that of Bologna, where Pepo (1075) and Irnerius (1100-1118) began to give their expositions. They had a numerous following, who, besides delivering exegetical lectures (“ordinariae” on the Digest and Code, ,i extraordi∙ nariae” on the rest of the Coipus Juris Civilis), also wrote Glossae, first interlinear, afterwards marginal. 4 The series of these glossators was closed by Accursius (see Accorso) with the compilation known as the Glossa ordinaria or magistralis, the authority of which soon became very great, so that ultimately it came to be a recognized maxim, “Quod non agnoscit glossa, non agnoscit curia.” 5 For some 1 See Matthaei, Glοssαriα groeca, Moscow, 1774-5.

2 See Labbe, Veteres glossae verborum juris quoe passim in Basilicis reρeriuntur (1606); Otto, Thesaurus juris Romani, vol. iik (1697); Stephens, Thesaurus linguae Groecae, vol. viii. (1825).

3 See Biener, Geschichte der Novellen, p. 229 sqq. 4 Irnerius himself is with some probability believed to have been the author of the Brλc∏ylogus (q.v.). 5 Thus Villani (De origine civitatis Florentines) says of the Glossae that “tantae auctoritatis gratiaeque fuere, ut consensu omnium publice approbarentur etspretisabolitisquepenitus aliis solaejuxtustextus legum oppositae sunt et ubique terrarum sine controversia pro legibus observantur, ita ut propemodum nefas sit, non secus quam textui, Glossis Accursii contraire, sicut antiqua fama referente comperi.” For similar testimonies see Bayle’s Dictionnaire, s.v. “Accursius” and Rudorff, Röm. Rechfsgeochichte, i. p. 338 (1857).

Bible Glosses.—WiTa the decay of learning and originality during the dark ages grew the necessity for making and the custom of transcribing on manuscript copies of the Vulgate various notes, explanatory or otherwise, of the text. Ultimately collections of these glosses or sets of glosses came to be made. They are distinguished as either marginal or interlinear. The most famous collection of Glossoe marginales was that made by Walafridus Strabus in the 9th century; it consists of notes grammatical, historical, and theological, culled from the writings of Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, Gregory, Isidore, Bede, Alcuin, and Hrabanus Maurus, with additions by himself. The interlinear glosses (which as a rule were not so full as the marginal) were sometimes theological but more generally purely philological. A somewhat important collection of interlineal glosses belonging to the former class was made by Anselm of Laon (c. 1100). The philological glosses have considerable value to the linguistic student, especially those which originated in Germany during the Carolingian period. The MS. vocabularies in the libraries of St Gall, Munich, Vienna, <fcc., have been frequently examined, of late years with results which have been fully indicated by Raumer in his treatise on the influence of Christianity upon Old High German (fSiηzοirkuηg des Christeηthums auf die althochdeutsche Sprache'). ^[1. Considerable interest of a similar kind attaches to the so-called Glossoe rnαlbergicee upon the Latin text of the Salic law. It was at one time held that in these glosses we have some relics of the ancient Celtic tongue; but their truly Germanic character was afterwards conclusively established by Jacob Grimm, ] Some interlinear vernacular translations of portions of the Bible into the Anglo-Saxon, of the 9th and following centuries, have also been recently reprinted (see English Btble).
