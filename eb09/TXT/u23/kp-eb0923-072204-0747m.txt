UMAÑ, a district town of Russia, in the south of the government of Kieff, is now a small industrial and trading town, with 15,400 inhabitants, many of whom are Jews, who carry on an active trade in the export of corn, spirits, <fcc. It has a remarkable park (290 acres), planted in 1796 by the orders of Count Potocki, in connexion with which a gardening school is maintained.

Umañ was founded towards the beginning of the 17th century as a fort against the raids of the Tartars. The Cossacks of the Ukraine, who kept it, revolted against their Polish rulers about 1665, and had to sustain a fierce siege. In 1674 it was plundered and most of its inhabitants murdered by the Ukrainians and Turks, during the wars for the hetmanship. In 1712 its last inhabitants were transferred by Peter I. to the left bank of the Dnieper. But by the end of the 18th century, when it again became the property of the Potockis, it was repeopled and became one of the busiest trading towns of Little Russia. In 1768, when the Cossacks revolted anew against their Polish serf proprietors, they took Umañ and murdered most of its inhabitants.
