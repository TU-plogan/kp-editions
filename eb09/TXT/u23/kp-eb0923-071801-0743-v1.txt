UGLITCH, a district town of Russia, in the government of Yaroslavl, is situated on the upper Volga, principally on its right bank, 67 miles to the west of the capital of the province. Its historical remains are mostly associated with the prince Dmitri (see vol. xxi. p. 93). The wooden house he occupied, a church of St Demetrius “on the Blood” erected at the spot where he was killed, and a kiosk on the site of the convent where his mother was forcibly consecrated a nun,—all commemorate this chapter in the history of the rule of the boiars at Moscow at the beginning of the 17th century. An old cathedral, erected in the 13th century but subsequently restored, and containing the grave of Prince Roman, recalls a still earlier period of municipal independence. Uglitch has now become a commercial and industrial city with 11,930 inhabitants (1883), and has an important trade, being one of the chief loading places on the upper Volga. Its industries comprise the sewing of sacks for corn and flour (about one million every year) and the knitting of woollen socks; and it has a paper-mill, distilleries, copper works, and linen factories. Corn, paper, sausages (with which the name of Uglitch has long been associated), candles, Ac., are shipped at the town.

Uglitch is one of the oldest towns of Russia; its local annals go as far as back as the 9th century. Until the 14th century it maintained its independence as a separate principality, which extended over eastern Tver, and elected its own princes. In 1329 the sons of Prince Roman the Saint renounced their independence in favour of Moscow, and fifty years later the Uglitch princes finally sold their rights to the great prince of Moscow. The Tartars plundered the town during their invasions of 1237, 1293, and 1408, as also did the Lithuanians at a later date.
