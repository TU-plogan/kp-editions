UDAIPUR [Oodeypore], or Mewár, a native state in Rajputana, India, with an area of 12,670 square miles. It extends from 23° 49' to 25° 58’ N. lat., and from 73° 7' to 75° 52’ E. long., and is bounded on the N. by the British territory of Ajmere; on the E. by the native states of Bundi, Gwalior, Tonk, and Partábgarh; on the S. by Banswára, Dungarpur, and Mahi Kántha; and on the W. by the Ara valli Mountains, separating it from Marwar and Sirohi. The greater part of the country is level plain. A section of the Aravalli Mountains extends over the southwestern and southern portions, and is rich in minerals, but the mines have been long closed. The general inclination of the country is from south-west to north-east, the Banas and its numerous feeders flowing from the base of the Aravalli range. There are many lakes and tanks in the state, the finest of which is the Dhebar or Jaisamand, with an area of nearly 21 square miles; it is considered to be the largest sheet of artificial water in the world. There are only two metal roads in the state; the Nimach State Railway passes through the north-eastern part.

In 1881 the population, exclusive of 51,076 Bhils, was 1,443,144 (males 772,685, females 670,459); Hindus numbered 1,321,521, Mohammedans 43,322, Jains 78,171, and Christians 130. The only town with over 10,000 inhabitants is Udaipur, the capital (38,214). This city is picturesquely situated on a lake 2000 feet above sealevel, and faces wooded hills. It contains the royal palace, which is a noble pile of granite and marble, built on the crest of a rocky ridge overlooking the lake, city, and valley. There are no manufactures of any importance in the state, and the crops as a rule only suffice for local wants. The principal imports are salt, piece goods, groceries, metals, medicines, sugar, ivory, and tobacco; and the exports are mostly confined to turmeric, gúr, cotton, indigo, til, opium, and cattle. The total income of Udaipur in 1885-86 was £259,624. The state was taken under the protection of the British Government in 1817, and it pays an annual tribute of £20,000. The family of the raja of Udaipur ranks highest in dignity among the Rajput chiefs of India.
