UBEDA, a town of Spain, head of an administrative subdivision in the province of Jaen, stands on a gentle slope about 5 miles from the right bank of the Guadalquivir, and about 22 miles to the east of the Menjibar station on the railway from Madrid to Cordova. Under the Moorish rule it was a place of considerable consequence, its population being said to have at one time numbered 70,000. Some portions of the old walls, with towers and gates, still remain, but none of the public buildings are of great age, the oldest church, that of San [9:23:716] Salvador, dating from 1540-56. The population within the municipal boundaries in 1877 was 18,149.
