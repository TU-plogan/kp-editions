ESTREMADURA, an old province of Spain, divided in 1833 into the provinces of Badajoz and Caceres, lies between 37° 58' and 40° 32' N. lat., and between [9:8:564] 4° 32' and 7 β 26' W. long,, being about 180 miles in length from N. to S. by 130 in extreme breadth, and having an area of about 14,280 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by Salamanca and Avila, E. by Toledo and La Mancha, S. by Cordova and Sevilla, and W. by Portugal. The Tagus and the Guadiana cross the province from E. to W., and their respective basins form two natural and nearly equal divisions, — that of the Tagus, being the northern, called Alta or Upper Estremadura, and that of the Guadiana, Baja or Lower Estremadura. These two basins are separated from each other by a range of mountains, of which the eastern and higher portion attains an elevation of from 5000 to 6000 feet above the level of the sea. This natural division corresponds to the division into the provinces of Badajoz and Caceres, the former being Baja Estremadura, and the latter Alta Estremadura. The basin of the Guadiana is bounded on the S. by a continuation of the Sierra Morena, which fills up the southern part of the province with hilly ground, and divides the waters of the Guadiana from those of the Guadalquivir. A branch of this chain proceeds northward from the confines of Cordova to the Guadiana. The basin of the Tagus is bounded on the N. by a range of mountains which proceed westward from Avila along the boundaries between Estremadura and Salamanca, and afterwards enter Portugal. From this northern range a branch proceeds in a S.W. direction between the rivers Alagon and Tietar; from the eastern part of the central range a branch proceeds in a N.W. direction to the Tagus. The climate iu summer is hot, but not unwholesome, except in some swampy places along the Guadiana. There is then but little rain; dew, however, is abundant, and sufficient to moisten the ground; and the nights are cool. Although the high mountains are-covered with snow in the end of November, the winters are not severe. The soil is very fertile, and might be rendered highly productive by a proper use of the waters of the many rivers by which it is intersected. Agriculture, however, is wholly neglected, and the noble plains that might yield abundance of all sorts of products are devoted only to pasturage. Vast numbers of merino sheep come annually from other parts to winter in these plains. Immense herds of swine are reared in the province, and constitute a great source of support to the inhabitants, not only supplying them with food, but also forming a great article of export to other provinces,—the pork, bacon, and hams being in high esteem. The extensive forests of oak, beech, and chestnuts afford an abundance of food for hogs. Olive, fruit, and cork trees are numerous. Garne is abundant, and fish swarm in the rivers and streams. Estremadura has mines of lead, copper, silver, and iron, but these are almost totally neglected; and the manufactures are few. The chief products are corn, wine, oil, hemp, and flax. The population of Estremadura in 1870 was 734,377.
