EUNUCH{evvovχof), an emasculated person. From remote antiquity among the Orientals, as also at a later period in Greece, eunuchs were employed to take charge of the women, or generally as chamberlains,— whence the name, oi τgv ei>vηv <∖orτ∈ς, i.e., those who have charge of the bedchamber. Their position in the harems of princes affording them the ready means of access to the royal person, it is not surprising that they were frequently enabled to exercise an important influence over princes, and even to raise themselves to stations of great trust and power. Hence the term eunuch in Egypt came to be applied to any court officer, whether a castratus or not. The vulgar notion that eunuchs are necessarily deficient in courage and in intellectual vigour is amply refuted by history. We are told, for example, by Herodotus that in Persia they were especially prized for their fidelity; and they were frequently promoted to the highest offices. Narses, the famous general under Justinian, was a eunuch, as was also Hermias, governor of Atarnea in Mysia, to whose manes the great Aristotle offered sacrifices, besides celebrating the praises of his patron and friend in a poem (still extant), addressed to Virtue (see Lucian’s dialogue entitled Eunuchus). To multiply instances were superfluous. The capacity of this class of persons for public affairs is strikingly illustrated by tho histories of Persia, India, and China; and we need only allude to the power exercised by the euuuchs under the later Roman emperors. The hideous trade of castrating boys to be sold as eunuchs for Moslem harems has continued to modern times, the principal district whence they are taken being the inland of north-eastern Africa. As the larger proportion of children die after the operation (generally total removal), such as recover fetch at least three or four times the ordinary price of slaves. Even more vile, as being practised among a civilized European nation, has been the Italian practice of castrating boys to prevent the natural development of the voice, in order to train them as adult soprano singers, such as might till lately be heard in the Sixtine Chapel. Though such mutilation is a crime punishable with severity, the supply of “soprani” never failed so long as their musical powers were in demand in high quarters. Driven long ago from the Italian stage by public opinion, they remained the musical glory and moral shame of the papal choir till the accession of the present pope (Leo XIII.), one of whose first acts was to get rid of them. Mention must here also be made of the class of voluntary eunuchs, who have emasculated themselves, or caused the operation to be performed on them, for the avoidance of sexual sin or temptation. This unnatural development of asceticism appears in early Christian ages, its votaries acting on the texts Mat. xix. 12, V. 28-30. Origen’s case is the most celebrated example, and by the 3d century there had arisen a sect of eunuchs, of whom Augustine says {De Heeres., c. 37), “Valesii et seipsos castrant et hospites suos, hoc modo existimantes Deo se dèbere servire” (see Neander, History of Chr. Church, vol ii. p. 462; Bingham, Antiq. Chr. Church, book iv, chap. 3). Such practices have been always opposed by the general body of the Christian churches, but have not even now ceased. It recently came into notice how large and prosperous a secret sect of the kind exists in Russia, whose practice of castration is expressed in the name of Skopzi, by which they are commonly described. (For details see F. v. Stein in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, 1875, p. 37, and Journal of Anthropology, 1870; also Haxthausen, Russian Empire, vol. i.) (e.b.t.)
