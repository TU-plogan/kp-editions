After studying at the university of Edinburgh, he was licensed as a preacher in 1709, and in 1711 was ordained as assistant minister at Dunfermline. He homologated the protests which his brother laid on the table of the Assembly after being rebuked for his synod sermon, but he did not formally withdraw from the Establishment till 1737. He was also present, though not as a member, at the first meeting of the Associate Presbytery.
