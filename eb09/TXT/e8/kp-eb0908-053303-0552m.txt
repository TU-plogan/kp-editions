ESAU, or Edom, the father of the Edomites, - was the son of Isaac and Rebecca, and the elder twin brother of Jacob. According to the narrative contained in Genesis, the name Esau (hairy) was given to him on account of his hairy appearance at his birth, and the name Edom (red) when he sold his birthright to Jacob for a meal of red lentile pottage. Esau, who was a hunter, having returned famished from the chase, found Jacob enjoying a savoury dish, and besought him to be allowed to share it. Jacob refused this, unless Esau made over to him the privileges of the elder son; and, prompted by the pangs of hunger, the latter immediately consented. Notwithstanding th is, and although by marriage with two Canaanitish women Esau had separated himself from the pure blood of Abraham, he would have received the covenant blessing from his father, had not Jacob secured it through the deceit of personating Esau, which, as his father was blind, he was able to accomplish by imitating the hairy appearance of his brother by means of goat skins. Esau, on hearing what Jacob had done, vowed to kill him, and the latter found it necessary to flee to Mesopotamia. Soon afterwards Esau, to propitiate his parents, married the daughter of Ishmael, but as they continued to be offended by the idolatrous practices of his Canaanitish wives, he retired from his father’s house and took up his residence in Mount Seir. Here he learned that Jacob was returning from Padanaram -with his wives, children, and flocks; but, whether propitiated by the humble bearing of the latter or not, he not only refrained from executing the vengeance he had sworn against him, but even offered to escort him on his way. The two brothers afterwards united in burying their father; but after that Esau “took all his substance which he had got in the land of Canaan, and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob.” Some modern critics regard the history of Jacob and Esau as in a great degree, if not altogether, mythical, and the recorded life of Esau as suggested very much by the nature of the country inhabited by his descendants, its history, and the relation of its inhabitants to those of Canaan. The words “Esau” and “Seir” etymologically suggest a shaggy mountain-land. According to Ewald (Gesch. d. V. Isr. i. 336, 430, 494), the three names Seir, Edom, Esau, indicate that an aboriginal race calling itself Seir was first subjugated by Canaanites bearing the name of Edom, and then both Seir and Edom by Hebrews bearing the name of Esau. Esau in its turn was compelled to yield to a younger branch of the same race, inferior in physical strength but superior in certain moral qualities. The Phoenicians have a parallel legend about their progenitor Hypsuranius and the aboriginal Usous (Esau).
