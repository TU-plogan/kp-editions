ESARHADDON (Assur-akhi-iddina, “Assur gave brothers ”) succeeded his father Sennacherib as king of Assyria, January 680 B.c. He had had to fight a battle a few weeks previously against his elder brothers, Adrammelech and Nergal·sharezer, who had murdered their father, and after their defeat fled to Armenia. The murder had probably been occasioned by the partiality shown by Sennacherib for Esarhaddon, a curious record of which has been preserved to us in a kind of will in which he bequeaths to Esarhaddon various private property. Esarhaddon seems to have been the ablest of the Assyrian monarchs; he was distinguished equally as a general and an organizer, and under him the Assyrian empire attained almost its furthest limits. His character, too, seems to have been milder than that of most other Assyrian kings, and his policy was one of conciliation. Babylon, which had been destroyed by Sennacherib in 691 B.c., was rebuilt, and made the southern capital. It was to Babylon, therefore, that Manasseh was brought (2 Chr. xxxiii. 11). Esarhaddon’s first object waa to strengthen his empire by overthrowing the rival monarchy of Egypt, and diverting the trade of Phoenicia to Nineveh. Zidon was accordingly razed to the ground, and the Assyrian arms carried as far as Cyprus; Tyre and Carchemish, however, rather than Nineveh, profited by the event. Egypt, then under the Ethiopian Tirhakah, was invaded, the Assyrians being supplied with water during their march across the desert by the king of the Arabians. Memphis and its treasures were captured, and Egypt as far as Thebes was made an Assyrian province, and divided into twenty satrapies. These twenty satrapies Herodotus has turned into a dodecarchy, and connected with the twelve courts of the Labyrinth built centuries before. The conquest of Egypt had been preceded by two important campaigns. One was against the Minni and the Medes, which secured the north-eastern frontier of the empire; the other was an expedition which penetrated into the heart of Arabia, and reflected the highest credit on the enterprise and military genius of the Assyrian monarch. His armies marched a distance of about 900 miles into the desert, traversing Uz and Buz (Khazu and Pasu), and reducing a large number of Arab tribes to subjection. The object of both these campaigns was clearly the same,—to spread terror among the barbarous tribes on the frontiers, and to prevent them from harassing the Assyrian provinces. Early in his reign Esarhaddon had checked the southward march of theGimir-rai, or Cimmerians, who had been driven from their old seats on the Volga by the Scyths. He defeated them under a chief named Teuspa (? Teispes) in Khupuscia (near Colchis), and drove them westward across theHalys tow ards Sinope. About the same time Cilicia and the Dahae were subdued, as well as Eden, or Tel-Assur, south-east of Assyria. Egypt had been aided in its struggle against Esarhaddon by Tyre, which had revolted from Assyria in spite of the favour shown to it. The town was at once blockaded; and the siege was still continuing when Esarhaddon died, in 668 B.C., after a reign of thirteen years, leaving behind him four sons and one daughter. Two years previously, just after his return from the Egyptian campaign, he had associated his son Assur-bani-pal, or Sardanapalus, in the government The fact was announced to an assembly of the people on the 12th day of Iyyar, or April.
