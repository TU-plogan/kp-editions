ETTLINGEN, the chief town of a district in the circle of Carlsruhe, Baden, Germany, is situated at the entrance of the valley of the Alb, on the railway from Manheim to Basel, 4â…œ miles south of Carlsruhe. Agriculture, the rearing of cattle, and the cultivation of madder and various kinds of fruits employ a portion of the population; but they are chiefly engaged in manufactures, paper-making, cottonspinning, weaving, cloth-dressing, and starch-making. Ettlingen possesses an old castle built on the site of a Roman fortress. This castle was burnt by the French in 1689, but was rebuilt at the beginning of the 18th century. The first notice of Ettlingen dates from the beginning of the 12th century. It was a free town till 1234, when it was presented by the emperor Frederick II. to the margrave of Baden. In 1644 it was conquered by the Weimar troops under Taupadel, and near the town Moreau was defeated by the archduke Charles 9th and 10th July 1796. In and around Ettlingen a large number of Roman antiquities have been found. The population in 1875 was 5286.
