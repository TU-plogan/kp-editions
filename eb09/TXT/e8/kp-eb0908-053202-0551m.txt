ERYX, an ancient city and mountain in the west of Sicily, six miles from Drepana, and a short distance from the sea shore. On the summit of the mountain stood a celebrated temple of Venus, called from that circumstance Erycina, under which name the goddess is frequently mentioned by the Latin poets. See Monte S. Giuliano.
