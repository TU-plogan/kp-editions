EROS, in Greek mythology, Love or Desire. By later poets he is represented as a son of Zeus and Gaia (the Earth), or Aphrodite, or Artemis; but in the Hesiodic theogony he makes up, with Chaos, Gaia, and Tartarus, the number of self-existent deities, and as the most beautiful of all the gods, he conquers the mind and will of both gods and men. The name Eros answers to the Vedic Arusha, a name applied to the sun, but only at his rising. Arusha, like the Greek Eros and the Latin Cupido, is spoken of as a child with beautiful wings.
