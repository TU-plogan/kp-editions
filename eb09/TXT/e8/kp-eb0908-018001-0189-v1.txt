EMPHYSEMA (from ψφw<iω, to inflate), in medicine, means an abnormal presence of air in certain parts of the body. In its restricted sense, however, it is generally employed to designate a peculiar affection of the lungs, of which there are two forms. In one of these there is overdistension of the air-cells of these organs (see Anatomy), and in parts destruction of their walls, giving rise to the formation of large sacs, from the rupture and running together of a number of contiguous air-vesicles. This is termed vesicular emphysema. In the other form the air is infiltrated into the connective tissue beneath the pleura and between the pulmonary air-cells, constituting what is known as interlobular emphysema.

The former variety is by far the more common, and appears to be capable of being produced by various causes, the chief of which are the following :—

1. Where a portion of the lung has become wasted, or its vesicular structure permanently obliterated by disease, without corresponding falling in of the chest wall, the neighbouring air vesicles or some of them undergo dilatation to fill the vacuum.

2. In some cases of bronchitis, where numbers of the smaller bronchial tubes become obstructed, the air in the pulmonary vesicles remains imprisoned, the force of expiration being insufficient to expel it; while, on the other hand, the stronger force of inspiration being adequate to overcome the resistance, the air-cells tend to become more and more distended, and permanent alterations in their structure, including emphysema, are the result.

3. Emphysema also arises from exertion involving violent expiratory efforts, during which the glottis is constricted, as in paroxysms of coughing, in straining, and in lifting heavy weights. Hooping cough is well known as the exciting cause of emphysema in many persons.

In whatever manner produced, this disease gives rise to important morbid changes in the affected portions of the lungs, especially the loss of the natural elasticity of the air-cells, and likewise the destruction of many of the pulmonary capillary blood-vessels, and the diminution of aerating surface for the blood. As a consequence of these, other changes are apt to arise affecting related organs, more particularly the heart and the venous system generally, one of the most frequent results of which is the occurrence of dropsy. The chief symptom in this complaint is shortness of breathing, more or less constant but greatly aggravated by exertion, and by attacks of bronchitis, to which persons suffering from emphysema appear to be specially liable. The respiration is of similar character to that already described in the case of asthma. In severe forms of the disease the patient comes to acquire a peculiar [9:8:181] puffy or bloated appearance, and the configuration of the chest is altered, assuming the character known as the barrel-shaped or emphysematous thorax.

The main element in the treatment of emphysema consists in attention to the general condition of the health, and in the avoidance of all causes likely to aggravate the disease or induce its complications. The same general plan of treatment as that recommended in asthma and bronchitis is applicable in emphysema. During attacks of urgent breathlessness antispasmodic remedies should be had recourse to, while the employment of dry cupping over the lungs, and even of moderate wet cupping over the precordium, will often afford marked and speedy relief.

Interlobular emphysema, arising from the rupture of air-cells in the immediate neighbourhood of the pleura, may occur as a complication of the vesicular form, or separately as the result of some sudden expulsive effort, such as a fit of coughing, or, as has frequently happened, in parturition Occasionally the air infiltrates the cellular tissue of the mediastinum, and thence comes to distend the integument of the whole surface of the body. When occurring suddenly and extensively, this has been known to produce death by asphyxia.
