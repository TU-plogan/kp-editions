EVANS, Sir De Lacy (1787-1870), a distinguished British soldier, son of John Evans of Milltown, Limerick, Ireland, was born in 1787. He was educated at Woolwich Academy, and entered the army in 1807 as ensign in the 22d regiment of foot. His regiment was immediately after wards gazetted for India, and during his stay of three years in that country he served with distinction in various actions, In 1812, as lieutenant of the 3d Dragoons, he joined the Peninsular army of Wellington; and in the Portuguese and Spanish campaigns of 1812, 1813, and 1814 he acquired a high reputation both for military skill and for personal bravery. He was rapidly promoted by merit, and in 1814 received the rank of lieutenantcolonel. The same year, in command of the 5th West India Regiment, he was sent to take part in the war against the United States, where he specially distinguished himself at the capture of Washington, and shared in the attack on Baltimore and the operations before New Orleans. He returned to England in the spring of 1815 in time to accompany the expedition of Wellington to Flanders, and was assistant quartermaster-general at Quatre Bras and Waterloo. As a member of the staff of the duke of Wellington he accompanied the English army to Paris, and remained there during the occupation of the city by the allies. In 1831 Evans entered the House of Commons as Liberal member for Rye; but in the electiou of 1832 he was an unsuccessful candidate both for that borough and for Westminster. For the latter constituency he was, however, returned in 1833, and, with the exception of the parliament of 1841-46, continued to represent it till 1865, when he retired from political life. His parliamentary duties did not, however, interfere with his career as a soldier. In 1835 he was sent in command of 10,000 men (the “Spanish Legion”) to aid the queen of Spain against Don Carlos. He remained two years, and gained several brilliant though bloody victories; and on his return in 1839 he was, in recognition of his achievements, created Knight Commander of the Bath. In 1846 he attained the rank of major-general; and in 1854, on the breaking out of the Russian war, he was appointed to the command of the second division of the army of the East. At the battle of the Alma his quick comprehension of the features of the combat largely contributed at various critical periods to the victory. On the 26th October, by the skilful manner in which he handled his troops, he brilliantly defeated, at a nominal loss, a large division of Russian forces which had attacked his position on Mount Inkerman. Illness and fatigue compelled him a few days after this to leave the command of his division in the hands of General Pennefather; but he rose from his sick-bed on the day of the battle of Inkerman, November 5, and declining to take the supreme command of his division from General Pennefather, he generously aided him in his long-protracted struggle by his countenance and advice. On the return of Evans to England in the following February invalided, he received for his services in the Crimea the thanks of the House of Commons, and the same year he was made Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, and the university of Oxford conferred on him the degree of D.C.L. In 1856 he received the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, and in 1861 he was gazetted general. He died 9th January 1870.
