ESPREMESNIL, otÉpréménil, Jean Jacques Duval d’ (1746-1794), was born in 1746 at Pondicherry, of which colony his father was at that time a member of the general council. He returned to France with his father in 1750, and after completing his studies for the legal profession became king’s advocate at Châtelet, and shortly afterwards councillor of the parlement of Paris. He was an enthusiastic defender of the rights of the parlements against the edicts of Louis XVI.; and having procured from the printers a copy of the edicts of May 1788, establishing bailiwicks, and re-establishing the cour plénière for the trial of those officers of the parlements who refused to register the edicts, he revealed this coup Tétai to an extraordinary assembly of all the chambers, and by a speech of great eloquence induced the magistrates to protest against what they considered the threatened violation of their rights. For this he was arrested, after an exciting scene, while occupying his place in the assembly. The president refused to point him out to the officer charged with his arrest, and each of the other members declared himself to be M. d'Esprémesnil; but at last Esprémesnil, while protesting against the violation of justice implied in his arrest, voluntarily delivered himself up. He was banished to the island of St Margaret, but when a change took place in the ministry a few months afterwards, he was recalled to Paris. Shortly after his return he was elected a deputy to the States-general, where he soon became as strenuous in his support of the privileges of the king as he had previously been of the privileges of the parlements; and after combating, often with a passionateness amounting to violence, the various decrees restraining the royal authority, he at the close of the assembly in 1791 formally protested against the new constitution. In 1792 he was recognized by the revolutionary mob at the Tuileries, and would have suffered summary execution had he not been rescued half dead from the hands of his tormentors by a patrol of the national guard. He obtained temporary refuge in the monastery of St Germains, and soon afterwards went to Havre, where he lived apparently forgotten till toward the end of 1793, when he was arrested and brought to Paris. He was tried before the revolutionary tribunal, and, being condemned to death, was executed 23d April 1794. (See the histories of the time.)
