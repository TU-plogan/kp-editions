ESNEH, or Isne, the Latopolis of the Greeks, a town of Upper Egypt, on the left bank of the Nile, 28 miles S.S.W. of Thebes, in 25° 17' 38" N. lat. and 33° E. long. Its position at the upper end of the Nile valley, which here widens out to a breadth of 4⅛ miles, is greatly in its favour, and it forms an important depot in the caravan trade from Sennaar. The local manufactures are shawls, cottons, and pottery. It has frequently served as a place of refuge for the political exiles of southern Egypt, and at the time of the French expedition it was occupied by the Mamelukes of Hassan, Osman, and Saleh Bey. More recently it has been the custom to transport thither female offenders from Cairo. To the south of the town lies a Coptic monastery which attracts a large number of pilgrims from far and near to visit the relics of the martyrs who were put to death at Esneh during the Diocletian persecution, 303 a.d. The population of the town is estimated at 30,000. For an account of the ancient temple of Kneph, see Egypt, vol. vii., p. 782.
