ENZIO, king of Sardinia (1225-1272), who played a great part in the conflict between the empire and the papacy in the first half of the 13th century, was one of the natural sons of the emperor Frederick II. by his mistress the beautiful Bianca Lancia. He was born at Palermo at the close of the year 1225, the same year in which his father married as his second wife Iolante of Jerusalem. His name is conjectured to be a corruption of the German “Hans.” In his thirteenth year he fought by his father’s side against the Lombards at the battle of Cortenuova; and in the following year (1238) the emperor, in pursuance of his determination to recover for the empire various territories claimed as fiefs of the Holy See, married Enzio to Adelasia, the widowed heiress of Sardinia and Corsica, and at the same time conferred on him the title of king of Sardinia. He also received the honour of knighthood from his father. In May 1239 he was declared vicar imperial in the north of Italy, and took command of the German and Saracen troops in the imperial army. From this time Enzio was his father’s right hand in war. He at once entered the Mardi of Ancona; and so formidable to the papacy were his achievements that the most distinguished soldier-cardinal, John of Colonna, was sent against him. Before the end of the year the pope, Gregory 1X., excommunicated Frederick and his son; and a crusade against them was soon after preached. This beating of the “drum ecclesiastic,” however, did not scare them from their purpose. In 1241 Enzio was entrusted with the command of the fleet, and in this post he added to his already high reputation by a victory over the Genoese. The pope having convoked a council at Rome, the prelates were flocking to it in large numbers in defiance of the emperor’s remonstrances and commands. They were conveyed on board a number of Genoese galleys; aud this fleet Enzio, in conjunction with the Pisans, encountered and defeated near Meloria (May 3). Three vessels were sunk and nineteen captured. Amongst the captives were three cardinal-legates, and many bishops aud archbishops. The booty taken was immense, and included the vast sums of money which the notorious Cardinal Otho had just collected in England. The prelates were all taken to Naples, and were kept in close confinement, bound with silver chains in mockery. After the death of the pope (Λugqst) Enzio was sent with a large army to aid his brother Conrad, king of the Romans, against the invading Tatar hosts. By the victory won by the two brothers of the house of Hohenstauffen, near the Delphos, an affluent of the Danube, Europe and Christendom were finally delivered from the presence of these desolating hordes. Enzio was afterwards sent into Lombardy, which was for several years the scene of his chief exploits. In 1245 he was excommunicated with the emperor by Pope Innocent IV. Two years later he besieged Parma, but was compelled to retire. He soon [9:8:455] after besieged Colonna. In 1249 he took the castle of Arola, and on this occasion he sullied his fair fame by putting to death more than a hundred Guelfs of Reggio who were taken prisoners there. At the head of the Modenese, Enzio encountered the troops of Bologna, May 26, 1249, at Fossalta, and was wounded and taken prisoner. He was consigned to perpetual imprisonment, and nothing could move his captors to abate a jot of their rigour. On one occasion he nearly succeeded in making his escape concealed in a cask, but was recognized by his golden hair. “A captive at the age of twenty-four,” says Dean Milman, “this youth, of beauty equal to his bravery,—the poet, the musician, as well as the most valiant soldier and consummate captain,—pined out twenty-three years of life, if not in a squalid dungeon, in miserable inactivity.” Enzio was passionately loved by Lucia Biadagioli, a high-boni maiden of Bologna, who was given to him as a companion; and she made several unsuccessful attempts to restore him to freedom. He was the best-beloved sou of the emperor, who would have given any sum for his ransom, and to whom the loss of him was a life-long affliction. Nor was he less idolized by his followers for his brave, honourable, and generous character as a leader in war. Enzio died in confinement at Bologna, March 14, 1272. The Bolognese gave him a magnificent funeral. His body was embalmed, robed in scarlet, and lay in state for some days wearing a golden crown and sceptre. It was then buried in the church of St Dominic, and a marble tomb was erected in memory of the hero. History, says Mr'Kington (Hist. of Frederick the Second, vol. ii. p. 289), does not record a more sorrowful tale.
