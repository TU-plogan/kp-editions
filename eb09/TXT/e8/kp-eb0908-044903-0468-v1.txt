ENRIQUEZ GOMEZ, Antonio, the name finally adopted by a Spanish dramatist and poet, who was the son of Don Diego Enriquez Villanueva, a converted Portuguese Jew, and during the first part of his public life was known as Enrique Enriquez de Paz. He was born in Seville, probably between 1600 and 1602, and obtained a classical education. His twentieth year was hardly out when he entered the army, and his military services procured him, not only the rank of captain, but also admission into the Portuguese order of San Miguel de Avis. About 1629 a number of comedies from his pen were represented in the theatre of Madrid, the Ccιrdenal de Albornoz and Fernan Mendez Pinto being especially applauded; and he was probably still in the capital in 1635, when there appeared his Fama postuma a la vida y muerte de Lope de Vega. Fear of persecution on account of his suspected Jewish proclivities seems to have led him to leave Spaiu in 1636; and in 1638 we find him in France, where he remained for eleven years, became councillor and majordomo to Louis XIII., and continued assiduously to write and publish. Shortly after 1656 he settled in Amsterdam, and in the religious tolerance of that city made open avowal of his Judaism, and thus had the honour of appearing in effigy in the great auto-da-fe celebrated in Seville on April 14, 1660. The date of his death is not known, but it was probably not many years later. He had at least one son, Diego Enriquez Basurto, who in 1649 published at Rouen El triumpho de la virtud y paciencia de Job. As a writer Enriquez is characterized by ready invention and a “fatal facility” of execution; and especially in his later works his style is full of extravagances. His Academias morales de las Musas, Bordeaux, 1642, contains, besides three other comedies, A lo que obliga el honor, which was the foundation of Calderon’s Medico de su honor. El siglo pitagorico y vida de don Gregorio Guadana, Rouen, 1644, 1647, and 16S7 (reprinted at Brussels by F. Foppens in 1727, and by Rivadeneyra in tom. xxxiii. of his Bibliotecα de Autores [9:8:450] cspanoles), is a series of satirical sketches in prose and verse, which partake of the character of the picaresque romance. La culpa del primer peregrino (Rouen, 1644; Madrid, 1735), a mystical poem; Luis dado de Dios a Anna (Paris, 1645), presenting the author’s views on political matters; Politica Angelica (Rouen, 1647); La torre de Babilonia (Rouen, 1647; Madrid, 1670), containing the two parts of Feι nan Mendez Pinto; Samson Nazareno, a heroic poem; and several comedies not mentioned above, complete the list of Enriquez’s acknowledged writings. Adolfo de Castro, however, in his notes to Gil Blas, advanced the opinion that the comedies usually attributed to Fernando de Zarate were really the production of Enriquez Gomez, who had merely adopted the shelter of a pseudonym to facilitate the iutroduction of his works into Spain. His principal authority was the following entry in the Index Expurgatorius: “Don Fernando de Zarate (is Antonio Enriquez Gomez)—His comedy, El capellan de la Virgen, San Ildefonso, is prohibited;” and the fact that almost nothing was known about Zarate lent a strong show of probability to his theory. The matter has since been eagerly debated. Mesonero Romanos, editor of vol. i. of the Dramaticos posteriores a Lope de Vega (i.e., vol. xlvii. of Rivadeneyra’s Biblioteca), though at first he adopted Castro’s opinion, has since become its vigorous opponent; and Barrera makes out a very strong case in favour of the historical individuality of Zarate, alleging, ⅛mong other arguments, that the subjects of the plays ascribed to him, El gran sepulcro de Cristo, Santa Maria Magdalena, &c., are not such as were likely to be treated in his later years by the Jewish poet, that autograph manuscripts of Zarate exist in various collections, and that the style and methods of the two writers are perceptibly distinct.
