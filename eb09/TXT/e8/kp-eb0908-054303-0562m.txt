ESKI-DJUMA, or Eski-Djumua, a town of Bulgaria, in the sanjak of Rustchuk, about 22 miles west of Shumla, on the northern slopes of the Binar-dagh. It has several mosques and baths, and derives great local importance from its fairs, of which the greatest, in May, is attended by a vast concourse of merchants from north and south, and displays a variety of German, French, Swiss, and Russian goods.
