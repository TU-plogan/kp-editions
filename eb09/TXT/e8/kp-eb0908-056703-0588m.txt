ETHELRED (or Aethelred) IL, surnamed the Unready (968-1016), an Anglo-Saxon king, the son of Edgar and Elfrida, was born in 968. On the murder of Edward the Martyr in 979, Ethelred succeeded him on the Anglo-Saxon throne. He is said to have owed his surname “Unready” lim., without rede or counsel) to Dunstan, who even when he placed the crown on Ethelred’s head prophesied that during his reign, on account of the sins of Elfrida, evils should fall upon the English such as they had never yet suffered. Such evils did fall upon them, and were doubtless chiefly due to the king. He possessed considerable energy when roused to exert himself, but it was only exercised fitfully, and generally misdirected, being always awanting at critical periods, and never used but to the disadvantage of his kingdom. Careless of everything but his immediate comfort or the gratification of an immediate whim, and listless and fond of ease, he allowed his kingdom and himself to be managed by worthless favourites, whose acts of, as it seems to us, open treachery were not only allowed to pass unpunished, in a manner which appears to us unaccountable, but seemed almost to form steps in their ladder of advancement to special influence and favour with the king. The successes attending the Danish invasions in the reign of Ethelred were due almost wholly to three causes,—the unpreparedness of the Anglo-Saxons, the treachery of the earls, and the failure of the king to follow up victories which were often won with no special preparation, and without adequate leaders. About two years after Ethelred mounted the throne the Danish invasions recommenced, but it was not till a later period that their inroads assumed the serious aspect of an attempt to conquer the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. In 988 they were defeated at Watchet in Somersetshire, and in 991 at Maldon, immediately after which latter victory, Ethelred purchased peace from his defeated enemies by money raised through means of the oppressive tax known as the “Danegeld.” The Danes were allowed to stay in England, and they on their part agreed to help Ethelred against any other foreign fleet that might attack him; but for some reason now unknown, a dispute arose in 992, and in a battle between the rival fleets, the Anglo-Saxons, notwithstanding the treachery of Elfric, were again victorious. After this the Danes sailed to the north of England and ravaged both sides of the Humber. In 994 Swend, king of the Danes, and Olaf, king of the Norwegians, combined their forces and attacked London, but their attempt was completely frustrated by the valour of the citizens; and they sailed away to accomplish the easier task of ravaging the southern coasts, when [9:8:568] Ethelred as usual did nothing to oppose them, but bought them off with a large sum of money. His efforts at conciliation were completely successful with Olaf, who, after being converted to Christianity, and adopted by Ethelred as his son, remained faithful ever afterwards to his promise of friendship. In the years 997, 998, and 999 the Danes ravaged the coasts of Wessex, Sussex, and Kent. In 1000 Ethelred, energetic at the wrong time and for wrong objects, invaded Normandy, but suffered a disastrous defeat. He concluded a treaty with that country soon afterwards, and in 1002 married Emma, daughter of Richard duke of Normandy. In the spring a treaty had been concluded with the Danes, but in the winter of the same year, Ethelred suspecting that they were plotting treachery, ordered a general massacre of all the Danes in England. Among others murdered was Gunold, sister of Swend; and the Danish king, to revenge her death and that of his countrymen, invaded the coast of Devonshire with a large force. He met with scarcely any opposition, and committed the usual ravages till 1007, when peace was concluded by Ethelred’s consenting, as at other times, to the payment of a large sum of money. In 1009 Ethelred collected the “largest fleet that had been seen in the reign of any king,” but it was soon afterwards nearly wholly destroyed by a violent storm, just before the Danes renewed their invasion. Ethelred, though he had gathered an army, was dissuaded from attacking them by Edric, and afterwards the English, through the treachery of their leaders, suffered a series of defeats; but in 1012 peace was again bought, and Thurkill, one of the Danish leaders, entered the English service. In 1013 Swend, with a more formidable fleet than any he had yet collected, sailed up the Humber, and then marched southward to London; but meeting there with a strenuous resistance, he was compelled to give up the attack and marched to Bath. Here he was proclaimed king, apparently by the Witan, and with the general consent of the English people, who were doubtless wearied of Ethelred’s incompetency, of the treachery of the nobles, and of the oppressive taxes which had been paid for no purpose. London itself soon acknowledged the Danish king, and Ethelred, after for a time taking refuge in ThurkilΓs fleet, escaped to Normandy. Swend died on February 1014, and on his death Ethelred was recalled by the Witan, on the promise of ruling better in future. In the same year he defeated Cnut, son of Swend, but in 1015 Cnut renewed his attack with a large fleet, and being joined by the traitor Edric, ravaged Wessex and Mercia, and was preparing to attack London, when Ethelred died April 23, 1016.
