EÖTVÖS, Jôzsef, Baron (1813-1871), a distinguished Hungarian statesman, author, poet, and orator, was born at Buda on the 3d September 1813. He was educated partly at his father’s estate at Ercsi, in the megye or county of Székesfehérvâr (Stuhlweissenburg), and partly in Buda, where also he studied law and philosophy from 1826-31. As early as 1830, Eötvös commenced his literary career by a translation of Goethe’s Goetz vοn Berlichingen, followed shortly afterwards by two original comedies and a tragedy Boszü (Revenge), which showed a singular beauty of style. In 1833, after having passed the requisite examinations at Pozsony (Pressburg), he began at the early age of twenty his official career as a vice-notary, which position he held for two years. He then went to Vienna, where he was employed at -the Hungarian chancellory; here, however, he only remained for a short time. In 1836 he commenced a long journey with the object of visiting the chief towns of Germany, Holland, France, and England, and did not return to Hungary before 1837. Shortly after this he was appointed to a seat in the district court of justice at Eperies, which office he soon resigned, withdrawing to his grandfather’s estate at Sälyi, where for some time he devoted himself to literary studies. His dramatic works had meanwhile attracted the attention of the Kisfaludy society, of which learned body he was elected a member in the year 1835. But he reached the zenith of his fame as an author in the year 1838, when his novel Karthawd (The Carthusian) appeared in the celebrated Arυizkonyv (Inunda- tion-BooT), of which he was himself the editor, and which [9:8:456] was published betweeu 1838 and 1841 at Pesth, for the benefit of the sufferers from the floods which devastated that city in 1838. The articles comprised in this work, which extended to five volumes, were contributed by various distinguished literary men, amongst whom Eötvös, as having written the longest and most important article, occupies a conspicuous place. In recognition of his literary merit he was in 1839 elected a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. In the year 1840 Eötvös, having removed from Sâlyi to Buda, took his seat in the Upper House of the Hungarian Diet, and identified himself with the advanced political movement of that period, aiding his eloquence by his writings. Among the many important works which emanated from his pen at this time, one entitled Λ Falu Jegyzoje (The Village Notary), which appeared in 1845, demands especial attention. In this work the author vividly depicts the abuses of the old system of public administration in Hungary by county elections; and the vigour of the narrative, combined with the humorous and political character of the incidents related, have caused it to be considered as one of the best national tales in the whole circle of European literature. An English translation of this romance by Otto Wenckstern, with an introduction by F. Pulszky, to whom the original was dedicated, appeared in 1850; and there is also an excellent German translation by Count J. Mailâth. The Notary was followed in 1847 by an historical romance of the 16th century, Magyarorszag 1514 ben, translated afterwards into German under the name of Bauernkrieg ; this work struck the keynote of that emancipation of the peasantry which was virtually effected in 1848. In fact, the reforms which from time to time were introduced into the Hungarian constitution must be in a great measure ascribed to the political and literary labours of Eötvös. His work Reform was a collection of articles which he had previously contributed to one of the leading Hungarian newspapers, the Pesti Hirlap.

Upon the formation of the first responsible Hungarian ministry on the 15th March 1848, Baron Eötvös received the portfolio of minister of public instruction; but on the 28th September he was obliged to relinquish that post, in consequence of the assassination of Lamberg, the Austrian governor of Hungary. He then proceeded to Vienna, and subsequently to Munich, returning to Pesth in 1851. Soon after his return he published an important political treatise, both in Hungarian and German, entitled Λ XIX. szazad uralkodo eszmeinek befolydsa az alladalomra (The Influence of the Ruling Ideas of the 19<Λ Century on the State). By this work, and others of a similar tendency, he was instrumental in preparing the popular mind for those constitutional changes which were afterwards so beneficially introduced; and when, in 1867, the second Hungarian ministry was called into existence, Eötvös was again entrusted with the portfolio of minister of public instruction. Already in the year 1855 he had been elected vice-president of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and in 1866 he attained the high honour of president. He died on the 2d February 1871, after a few weeks’ illness, in the fifty-eighth year of his age.
