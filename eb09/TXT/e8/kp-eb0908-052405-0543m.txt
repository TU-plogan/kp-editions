ERIS, in Greek mythology, a sister of the war-god Are?, and in the Hesiodic theogony a daughter of Nyx, the nighι, who is also the mother of righteous recompense, Nemesi?. In the Iliad Eris, or Strife, is described as insignificant at first, but as swelling until her head touches the heavens. In the legend of the Trojan war, Eris is th.e goddess who at the marriage festival of Peleus and Thetis flings on the table a golden apple, which is inscribed as a gift for the fairest of the fair. The rivalry of the three deities—Hera, Aphrodite, and Athena—for the gift is decided by the Judgment of Paris, who, being appointed umpire by Zeus, bestows it on Aphrodite. In the AeîîcîîZ she appears under the name of Discordia.
