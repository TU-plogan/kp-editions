EVELYN, John (1620-1706), the diarist and author of Sylva, was born at his father’s seat at Wotton, in Surrey, on the 31st October 1620. He was the younger son of a country gentleman of large estate, and much respected throughout the counties of Surrey and Sussex, of which he was high sheriff, one high sheriff at that time serving for both counties. Notwithstanding the wealth and position of his family, John Evelyn was educated at the free school of Lewes, where his maternal grandfather resided. While still at school, he was admitted into the Inner Temple; and in the following month, at the age of sixteen, he entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a fellow-commoner. In July 1641, having lost his father during the previous year, he retired from England, which was then on the eve of civil war. Before proceeding with his travels, he⅞xpressed his sympathy with the cause of the queen of Bohemia, which was dear to all Protestant Englishmen, by serving in her army for a few days, “according to the compliment.” The ten following years he spent abroad, only making brief visits to England.

It is with this period of travel that his famous Diary, which he had commenced in imitation of his father at eleven years of age, begins to be full and interesting. This diary is for many reasons of value to the student of history and manners. It comprises the long period, so rich in great events, between the outbreak of [9:8:735] the civil war and the accession of Anne. Written with no thought of publication, it embodies the frankest expression of its author’s opinions, and affords much curious and interesting information which the historian would have probably passed over, .but which throws a strong light upon the customs and feelings of the age. And Evelyn’s statements are always worthy of at least a respectful hearing. In an age of fiercest political and ecclesiastical conflict, himself subject to strong temptations to partisanship, he maintained throughout life the same calm temperance of judgment; and, amid general profligacy, the purity and integrity of his character remained unstained. The competence of his fortune and the moderation of his ambition rendered him politically independent. His attachment to monarchy did not blind him to the vices of kings. Though an earnest Protestant and a firm Episcopalian, he did not allow himself to be carried away into the extravagant bigotry so common among his contemporaries; he deprecated the persecution of the Protestant dissenters, and though he wrote against the Jesuits, he refused to join in the mad hatred with which all who professed the Roman Catholic faith were popularly regarded.

In 1652 Evelyn returned home with his wife, the amiable and talented daughter of Sir Richard Browne, and settled at Say es Court, the house afterwards famous as the residence of Peter the Great. Though well known to be a royalist, he was not molested, except on one occasion, when he was arrested by a party of fanatic soldiers for observing Christmas Day, but, nothing else being proved against him, was at once released. On the death of Cromwell, he published an Apology for the Royal Party, and tried in vain to persuade Colonel Morley to declare for Charles II. From the Restoration till his death in 1706 he enjoyed unbroken court favour. In the reign of James IL, during the absence of the earl of Clarendon in Ireland, he acted as one of the commissioners of the Privy Seal, and honourably distinguished himself by refusing, at the risk of offending the king, to sign an illegal licence of popish books. But, with this exception, he never accepted an office of political importance. His life, however, was filled with useful work. He was commissioner for improving the streets and buildings of London, for ‘ charitable uses” (7.e., for examining into the affairs of charitable institutions), and for taking care of the wounded who were brought home during the Dutch war, commissioner of the mint, commissioner of trado and plantations, &c. His love of scimce led to his being chosen secretary of the Royal Society, and he twice declined the presidency. It was through his influence that the Arundelian marbles and the library and MSS. of the earl of Arundel were presented to the university of Oxford, a service which the university recognized by conferring upon him the degree of D.C.L. His writings were exceedingly numerous. The best known were his Diary and Sylva, an elaborate treatise on arboriculture. Among the others may be mentioned Navigation and Commerce, their Original and Progreess, intended as an introduction to a history of the Dutch war, which he both commenced and laid aside at the command of Charles IL; a Parallel of Ancient and Modern Architecture; Public Employment preferred to Solitude; and The History of the Four Great Impostors. The first collection of Evelyn’s miscellaneous writings, several of which had been published anonymously, appeared in 1825, printed in facsimile, and edited by W. Upcott.
