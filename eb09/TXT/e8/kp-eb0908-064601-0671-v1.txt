ETTMÜLLER, Michael (1644-1683), a German physician, born at Leipsic, May 26, 1644. After having studied languages, mathematics, and philosophy at his native town, he went to Wittenberg, and, returning to Leipsic, obtained a medical diploma there in 1666. He travelled in Italy, France, and England, and then retired to Leyden, where he had intended to spend some time in study; but he was suddenly recalled to Leipsic in 1668, and received the degree of doctor immediately after his arrival. He was admitted a member of the faculty of medicine in 1676. About the same time the university of Leipsic confided to him the chair of botany, and appointed him extraordinary professor of surgery, the duties of which he discharged with distinction. He died on the 9th March 1683. Although Ettmiiller only wrote short dissertations and mere opuscula, he enjoyed an immense reputation. He had the art of interesting and fixing the attention by a ready elocution, and by arguments sometimes much more specious than solid.

The following is a list of his works :— De Siηqulαrihus, a thesis defended by Ettmiiller in 1663; Medicina Hippocratis Chimica, Leipsic, 1670; Vis Opii diaphoretica, Leipsic, 1679; Chimia Rationalis ac Erperimentalis curiosa, Leyden, 1684; Medicus Theoria et Praxi generali instructus, Frankfort and Leipsic, 1685. Various editions of his collected works have been published, but the best is that of his son, who was also a physician of some eminence, entitled Opera Medica theoretica-practica per filιum Michac∙ lemErnestum, efc., Frankfort, 1708, 3 vols. fol. There is no complete translation of the works of Ettmiiller, but there are numerous German, English, and French translations of the different treatises.
