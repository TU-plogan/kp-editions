ERDÉLYI, JÂxos (1814-1868), an Hungarian poet and author, was born in 1814 at Kapos, in the county of Ungvâr, and educated at the Protestant college, of Sârospatak. In 1833 he removed to Pesth, where, having attracted notice by his poetical talents, he was, in 1839, elected member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. His literary fame was much enhanced by his collection of Hungarian national poems and folk-tales, Magyar Népkoltesi Gyüjtemény, Népdalok es Mondak (Pesth, 1846-47). This work, published by the Kisfaludy Society, was supplemented by a dissertation upon Hungarian national poetry, afterwards partially translated into German by Stier (Berlin, 1851). Erdélyi also compiled for the Kisfaludy Society an extensive collection of Hungarian proverbs— Magyar Kozmonddsok konyve (Pesth, 1851),—and was for some time editor of the Szépirodalmi. Szemle (Review of Polite Literature). In 1848 he was appointed director of the national theatre at Pesth; but after 1849 he resided at his native town. He died [9:8:520] on the 23rd January 1868. The most important recent work bearing his name is a collection of folk lore, published the year after his death, entitled Λ Nép Kolteszete. nepdalok, népmesek es koznιondasok (Pesth, 1869). This work contains 300 national songs, 19 folk-tales, and 7362 Hungarian proverbs.
