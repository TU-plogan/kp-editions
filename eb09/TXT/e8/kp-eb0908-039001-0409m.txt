ENGLISH LANGUAGE. In its widest sense, the name is now conveniently used to comprehend the language of the English people from their settlement in Britain to the present day, the various stages through which it has passed being distinguished as Old, Middle, and New or Modern English. In works yet recent, and even in some still current, the name English is confined to the third, or at most extended to the second and third of these stages, since the language assumed in the main the vocabulary and grammatical forms which it now presents, the oldest or inflected stage being treated as a separate language, under the title of Anglo-Saxon, while the transition period which connects the two has been called Semi-Saxon. This view had the justification that, looked upon by themselves, either as vehicles of thought or as objects of study and analysis, Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, and Modern English are, for all practical ends, distinct languages,—as much so, for example, as Latin and Spanish. No amount of familiarity with Modern English, including its local dialects, would enable the student to read Anglo-Saxon, three-fourths of the vocabulary of which have perished and been reconstructed within 800 years;^[1. A careful examination of several letters of Bosworth’s Anglo-Saxon Dictionary gives in 2000 words (including derivatives and compounds, but excluding orthographic variants! 535 which still exist as modern English words. ] nor would a knowledge even of these lost words give him the power, since the grammatical system, alike in accidence and syntax, would be entirely strange to him. Indeed, it is probable that a modern Englishman would acquire the power of reading and writing French in less time than it would cost him to attain to the same proficiency in Old English; so that if the test of distinct languages be their degree of practical difference from each other, it cannot be denied that “Anglo-Saxon” is a distinct language from Modern English. But when we view the subject historically, recognizing the fact that living speech is subject to continuous change in certain definite directions, determined by the constitution and circumstances of mankind, as an evolution or development of which we can trace the steps, and that, owing to the abundance of written materials, this evolution appears so gradual in English that we can nowhere draw distinct lines separating its successive stages, we recognize these stages as merely temporary phases of an individual whole, and speak of the English language as used alike by Cynewulf and by Tennyson, just as we include alike King Alfred and Mr Bright as members of the English race.^[2. The practical convenience of having one name for what was the same thing in various stages of development is not affected by the probability that (Mr Freeman notwithstanding) Engle and Englisc were, at an early period, not applied to the whole of our Teutonic ancestors in Britain, but only to a part of them. The dialects of Engle and Seαxαn were alike old forms of what was afterwards Englis)ι speech, and so, viewed in relation to it, Old English, whatever their contemporary names might be. ] It must not be forgotten, however, that in this wide sense the English language includes, not only the literary or courtly forms of speech used at successive periods, but also the popular and, it may be, altogether unwritten dialects that exist by their side. Only on this basis, indeed, can we speak of Old, Middle, anl Modern English as the same language, since in actual fact the precise dialect which is now the cultivated language, or “English” par excellence, is not the descendant of that dialect which was the cultivated language or English of Alfred, but of a sister dialect then sunk in obscurity,—even as the direct descendant of Alfred’s “Englisc” is now tobe found in the neglected and non-literary rustic speech of Wiltshire and Somersetshire. Causes which, linguistically considered, are external and accidental, have shifted the political and intellectual centre of England, and along with it transferred literary and courtly patronage from one form of English to another; if the centre of influence had happened to be fixed at York or on the banks of the Forth, both would probably have been neglected for a third.

The English language, thus defined, is not “native” to Britain, that is, it was not found here at the dawn of history, but was introduced by foreign immigrants at a date many centuries later. At the Roman Conquest of the island, the languages spoken by the natives belonged all (so far as is known) to the Celtic branch of the Aryan family, modern forms of which still survive in Wales, Ireland, the Scottish Highlands, Isle of Man, and Brittany, while one has quite recently become extinct in Cornwall. Dialects allied to Welsh and Cornish were apparently spoken over the greater part of Britain, as far north as the Firths of Forth and Clyde; beyond these estuaries and in the isles to the west, including Ireland and Man, dialects akin to Irish and Scottish Gaelic prevailed. The dialect of the Picts in the east of Scotland, according to recent inquiries, presented characteristics uniting the British or Cymric with the Gaelic division.^[3. As to the place of the Pictish, see Dr W. F. Skene’s Four Ancien! Books of Wales, I. vii., viii. Prof. Rhys says “the Picts, Mr Skeno notwithstanding, were probably Kymric rather than Goidelic.”— Welsh Philology, p. 19. ] The long occupation of South Britain by the Romans (43-409 a.d.) — a period, it must not be forgotten, equal to that from the close of the Middle Ages to the present day, or to the whole duration of Modern English—familiarized the provincial inhabitants with Latin, which was probably the ordinary speech of the [9:8:391] towns. Gildas, writing nearly a century and a half after the renunciation of Honorius, addressed the British princes in that language j^[4. The works of Gildas in the original Latin were edited by Mr Stevenson for the English Historical Society. There is an English translation in Six Old English Chronicles in Bohn’s Antiquarian Library. ] and the linguistic history of Britain might have been not different from that of Gaul, Spain, and the other provinces of the Western Empire, where a rustic Latin giving birth to a neo-Latinic language finally superseded the native one except in remote and mountainous districts,^[5. As to the continued existence of Latin in Britain, see further in Rhys’s Lectures on Welsh Philology, p. 226-7. ] when the course of events was entirely changed by the Teutonic conquests of the 5th and 6th centuries.

The Angles, Saxons, and their allies belonged to the Teutonic or Gothic branch of the Aryan family, represented in modern times not only by the English and their colonies, but by the populations of Germany, Holland, Denmark, and the Scandinavian peninsula, and found at the dawn of history located between and about the estuaries and lower courses of the Rhine and the Weser, and the adjacent coasts and isles. For more than 1000 years the Teutonic or Gothic stock has been divided into the three branches of the Low German, High German, and Scandinavian, of which the former represents the original stock, the two others being offshoots to the south and north respectively. To it also belonged the Moeso-Gothic, the tongue of certain Germans who, passing down the Danube, invaded the borders of the empire, and obtained settlements in the province of Moesia, where their lauguage was committed to writing in the 4th century; its literary remains are of peculiar value as the oldest specimens, by several centuries, of Teutonic speech. To the Low German division also belonged the dialects of the invaders of Britain. As we have no specimens of the language of these tribes for nearly three centuries after their settlement in this island, we cannot tell to what extent they agreed with, and differed from, each other; nor can we be sure whether the differences actually found at a later period, when we have opportunity of comparison, between northern and southern English, were due to original diversity, or to subsequent differentiation. However, as the dialectal differences afterwards discernible corresponded in the main to the areas historically assigned to Angles and Saxons respectively, it may be assumed that there was some difference of dialect to begin with, that of the Saxons being more closely allied to the Old Saxon of the Continent, of which Dutch is probably the nearest living representative, and the Angle dialect having more affinity with the Frisian, and through that with the Scandinavian. At the present day the most English or Angli-form dialects of the Continent are those of the North Frisian islands of Amrum and Sylt, on the west coast of Schleswig. It is well known that the greater part of the ancient Friesland has been swept away by the encroachments of the North Sea, and the disjecta membra of the Frisian race, pressed by the sea in front and encroaching nationalities behind, are found only in isolated fragments from the Zuyder Zee to the coasts of Denmark. Of the Ge<itas, Eôtas, or “Jutes,” who, according to Baeda, formed the third tribe along with the Angles aud Saxons, it is difficult to speak linguistically. In the opinion of the present writer, the speech of Kent has ever been a typically southern or “Saxon” one, and at the present day its popular dialect is identical with that of Sussex, one of the old Saxon kingdoms; that of the Isle of Wight differs in no respect from that of Hampshire, nor does it show any special connection with that of Kent. Mr Henry Sweet has, however, shown^[6. “Dialects and Prehistoric Forms of English,” Transactions of ths Philological Society for 1S75-6, p. £43. ] that Kentish as early as the 8th cen tury differed from West-Saxon in one or two points of vowel pronunciation, and that the distinction was maintained as late as the 14th; though it cannot be said to have therein approached more closely to the northern dialect, which ought to have been the case had Baeda’s “Geâtas” been Jutlanders.

As it was amongst the Angel-cynn or Engle of Northumbria that literary culture first flourished, and an Angle or Englisc dialect was the first to be used for vernacular literature,^[7. See also Earle’s Philology of the English Tongue, p. 25. ] Englisc came eventually to be a general name for all forms of the vernacular as opposed to Latin, <tc.; and even when the West-Saxon of Alfred became in its turn the literary or classical form of speech, it was still called Englisc or English. The origin of the name Anglo-Saxon is disputed, some maintaining very positively that it means a union of Angles and Saxons, others (with better foundation) that it meant English Saxons, or Saxons of England, as distinguished from Saxons of the Continent Its modern use is mainly due to the little baud of scholars who in the 16th and 17th centuries turned their attention to the long forgotten language of Alfred and Aelfric. which, as it differed so utterly from the English of their own day 3 they found it convenient to distinguish by a name which was applied to themselves by those who spoke it.^[8. Aethelstan in 934 calls himself in a charter “Ongol-Saxna cyning and Brytaenwalda eallaes thyses iglandes;” Eadred in 955 is “Angul-seaxna cyning and casere totius·Britanniae,” and the name is of frequent occurrence in Latin documents. These facts ought to be remembered in the interest of the scholars of the l?th century, who have been blamed for the use of the term Anglo-Saxon, as if they had invented it. By “Anglo-Saxon” language they meant the language of the people who sometimes at least called themselves “Anglo-Saxons.” Even now the name is practically useful, when we are dealing with the subject per se, as is Old English, on the other hand, when we aro tτeating it historically or in connexion with English as a whole. ] To them “Anglo-Saxon” and “English” were separated by a gulf which it was reserved for later scholars to bridge across, and show the historical continuity of the English of all ages.

As already hinted, the English language, in the wide sense, presents three main stages of development—Old, Middle, and Modern—distinguished by their inflexional characteristics. The latter can be best summarized in the words of Mr Henry Sweet, in his History of English Sounds; ^[9. Transactions of the Philological Society, 1873—4, p. 620. ] “Old English is the period of full inflexions (name, gifan, caru), Middle English of levelled inflexions (naame, given, cααre), and Modern English of lost inflexions fame, give, care = nam, giv, car). We have besides two periods of transition, one in which nama and name exist side by side, and another in which final e [with other endings] is beginning to drop.” By lost inflexions it is meant that only very few remain, and these mostly non-syllabic, as the -s in stones, the -ed in love<7, the -r in their, as contrasted with the Old English stan-αs, luf-ocZ-e and luf-o<7-on, ]>Λ-rα. Each of these periods may also be divided into two—an early and a late; but from the want of materials this division may be waived in regard to the first. We have thus the following divisions, with the approximate dates, which, however, varied considerably for different dialects and parts of the country :—
[table]
[9:8:392]

Transition period. But the division given above, which was, I believe, first proposed by Mr Sweet, represents better the development of the language.

The Old English, or Anglo-Saxon tongue, as introduced into Britain, was highly inflexional, though its inflexions were not so full as those of the older Moeso-Gothic, and considerably less so than those of Greek and Latin during their classical periods. They corresponded on the whole to those of modern literary German, though both in nouns and verbs the forms were more distinct; for example, the German guten answers to three Old English forms,— godne, godum,godan; guter to two — godre, gbdra; liebten to two,-lufodon and lufeden. Nouns had four cases, Nominative, Accusative (not always distinct), Genitive, Dative, the latter used also with prepositions to express locative, instrumental, and most ablative relations; of a distinct instrumental case only vestiges occur. There were several declensions of nouns, the main division being that known in Teutonic languages generally as strong and weak,—a distinction also extending to adjectives in such wise that every adjective assumed either inflexion as determined by associated grammatical forms. The first and second personal pronouns possessed a dual; the third person had a complete declension of the stem he, instead of being made up as now of the three seen in he, she, they. The verb distinguished the subjunctive from the indicative mood, but had only two inflected tenses, present and past,—the former also used for the future, the latter for all the shades of past time. The order of the sentence corresponded generally to that of German. Thus from King Alfred’s additions to his translation of Orosius :—Donne ]>y ylcan daege hi hine to paem ade heran wyllaÖ, j>onne todaelaÔ hi his feoh. J>aet paer to lafe biδ aefter paem gedrynce and paem plegan. on fif oδ<5e syx. hwilum on ma. swa swa J>aes feos andefn biδ. “Then the same day [that] they him to the pile bear will, then divide they his property that there to remainder is, after the drinking and the sports, into five or six, at times into more, according as of the property the value is.”

The poetry was distinguished by alliteration, and the abundant use of figurative and metaphorical expressions, of bold compounds and archaic words never found in prose. Thus in the following lines from Beowulf :—

>S⅛ra6t waes s/ân-fâh, sHg wisode 6'umum aetyaedere. (/ùft-byrne scân 7/eard Λond-locen. Λring-iren scir *S ’ ong in searwum, pa his to sele furβum In hyra yry're yeatwum, øangan cwomon.^[10. Thorpe’s Beowulf, l. 645. ]

The street was stone-variegated, (it) pointed the path To (the) men together; the war-mailcoat shone,

“Hard hand-locked. The ring-iron sheer (bright ringmail)

Sang in their cunning-trappings, as they to hall forth In their horror-accoutrements to go came.”

The Old English was a homogeneous language, having very few foreign elements in it, and forming its compounds and derivatives entirely from its own resources. A few Latin appellatives learned from the Romans in the German wars had been adopted into the common Teutonic tongue, and are found in English as in the allied dialects. Such were straete, street (via strata), camp, battle, casere, Caesar, mil, mile, pin, punishment; perhaps cyrice, church, biscop, bishop, loeden, Latin language, cese, cheese, butor, butter, pipor, pepper, olfend, camel (elephantus), pund, pound, ynce, inch (uncia), and a few others. The relations of the first invaders to the Britons were to a great extent those of destroyers; and with the exception of the proper names of places and prominent natural features, which as is usual were retained by the new population, few British words found their way into the Old English. Among these are named broc, a badger, brec, breeches, clut, clout, pul, pool, and a few words relating to the employment of field or household menials. Still fewer words seem to have been adopted from the provincial Latin, almost the only certain one being castra, applied to the Roman towns, which appeared in English as c<xstre, ceaster, now found in composition as -caster, -ehester, -cester. The introduction and gradual adoption of Christianity, brought a new series of Latin words connected with the offices of the church, the accompaniments of higher civilization, the foreign productions either actually made known, or mentioned in the Scriptures and devotional books. Such were myηster (monasterium), aelmesse (eleemosyna), candel (candela), turtle (turtur), fie (ficus), cedar (cedrus). These words, whose number increased from the 7th to the 10th century, are commonly called Latin of the second period, the Latin of the first period including the Latin words brought by the English from Germany, as well as those picked up in Britain either from the provincials or the Welsh, which have not hitherto been separated from them. The Danish invasions of the 8th and 10th centuries resulted in the establishment of extensive Danish and Norwegian populations, about the basin of the Humber and its tributaries, and above Morecambe Bay. Although these Scandinavian settlers must have greatly affected the language of their own localities, few traces of their influence are to be found in the literature of the Old English period. As with the greater part of the words adopted from the Celtic, it was not until after the dominion of the Norman had overlaid all preceding conquests, and the new English began to emerge from the ruins of the old, that Danish words in any number made their appearance in books, as equally native with the Anglo-Saxon.

The earliest specimens we have of English date to the end of the 7th century, and belong to the Anglian or northern dialect, which, under the political eminence of the early Northumbrian kings from Edwin to Ecgfrift, aided perhaps by the learning of the scholars of Iona, first attained to literary distinction. Of this literature in its original form mere fragments exist, one of the most interesting of which consists of the verses uttered by Baeda on his deathbed, and preserved in a nearly contemporary MS.

Fore there neid-faerae. naenig uuiurthit thonc-snotturra. than him tharf sie, to ymb-hycggannae . aer his hin-iongae, huaet his gastae. godaes aeththa yflae⅜ aefter deoth-daege . doemid uueorthae.

Before the inevitable journey no one becomes More thought-prudent than he has need, To ponder, ere his hence-going, What, to his ghost, of good or of ill, After death-day, deemed shall be.

But our chief acquaintance with Old English is in its West-Saxon form, the earliest literary remains of which date to the 9th century, when under the political supremacy of Wessex and the scholarship of King Alfred it became the literary language of the English nation, the classical “Anglo-Saxon.” If our materials were more extensive, it would probably be necessary to divide the Old English into several periods; as it is, Mr Sweet, who has laboured chiefly in this field, has pointed out considerable differences between the “early West-Saxon” of King Alfred and the later language of the 11th century,^[11. See Mr Sweet’s preface to his edition of King Alfred's West-Saxon Version of Gregory's Pastoral Gare, Early English Text Society, 1871-2. ] the earlier language having numerous inflexional and phonetic distinctions which are “levelled” in the later, showing that the tendency to pass from the synthetical to the analytical stage existed quite [9:8:393] independently of the Norman Conquest. The northern dialect, whose literary career had been cut short in the 8th century by the Danish invasions, reappears in the 10th in the form of glosses to the Latin gospels and the Ritual of Durham, where we find that in the process of inflexionlevelling it has, owing to the confusion which had so long reigned in the north, advanced far beyond the sister dialect of the south, so as to be already almost Transition English, or “Semi-Saxon.”

Among the literary remains of the Old English may be mentioned the epic poem of Beowulf, the original nucleus of which has been supposed to date to heathen and even Continental times, though we now possess it only in a later form; several works of Alfred, two of which, his translation of Orosius, and of The Pastoral Care of St Gregory, are contemporary specimens of his language; the theological works of Aelfric (including translations of the Pentateuch and the gospels) and of Wulfstân; the poetical works of Cynewulf: those ascribed to Caedmon; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle; and many works both in prose and verse of which the authors are unknown.

The earliest specimens, the inscriptions on the Ruthwell and Bewcastle crosses, are in a Runic character; but the letters used in the manuscripts generally are a British variety of the Roman alphabet which the Anglo-Saxons found in the island, and which was also used by the Welsh and Irish.^[12. See on this Rhys, Lectures on Welsh Philology, v. ] Several of the letters had in Britain developed forms, and retained or acquired values, unlike those used on the Continent, in particular bfjpj∙c(dfgrst). The letters k q z were not used, q being represented by cw; u or V was only a vowel, the consonantal power of v being repre sented as in Welsh by f. The Runes called thorn and wen, for which the Roman alphabet had no character, were at first expressed by th, Ö (a contraction for bb or bh), and v or u; but at a later period the characters ]> and p were revived from the old Runic alphabet. Contrary to Continental usage, the letters c and 5 (g) had only their hard or guttural powers, as in the neighbouring Celtic languages; so that words which, when the Continental Roman alphabet came to be used for Germanic languages, had to be written with k, were in Old English written with c, as cimce = kirke. The key to the values of the letters, and thus to the pronunciation of Old English, is also to be found in the Celtic tongues whence the letters were taken.

The Old English period is usually considered as terminating about the year 1100,—that is, with the death of the generation who saw the Norman Conquest. The Conquest established in England a foreign court, a foreign aristocracy, and a foreign hierarchy.^[13. For a discriminating view of the effects of the Norman Conquest on the English Language, see Freeman, Norman Conquest, ch. xxv. ' ] The French language, in its Norman dialect, became the only polite medium of intercourse. The native tongue, despised not only as unknown but as the language of a subject race, was left to the use of boors and serfs, and except in a few stray cases ceased to be written at all^[14. There is not the least reason to suppose that any attempt was made to proscribe or suppress the native tongue, which was indeed used in some official documents addressed to Englishmen by the Conqueror himself. Its social degradation seemed even on the point of coming to an end, when it was confirmed and prolonged for two centuries more by tlve accession of the Angevin dynasty, under whom everything French received a fresh impetus. ] The natural results followed. When the educated generation that saw the arrival of the Norman died out, the language, ceasing to be read and written, lost all its literary words. The words of ordinary life whose preservation is independent of books lived on as vigorously as ever, but the literary terms, those that related to science, art, andhigher culture, the bold artistic compounds, the figurative terms of poetry, were speedily forgotten. The practical vocabulary shrank to a fraction of its former extent. And when, generations later, English began to be used for general literature, the only terms at hand to express ideas above those of every day life were to be found in the French of the privileged classes, of whom alone art, science, law, and theology had been for generations the inheritance. Hence each successive literary effort of the reviving English tongue shows a larger adoption of French words to supply the place of the forgotten native ones, till by the days of Chaucer they constituted a formidable part of the vocabulary. Nor was it for the time being only that the French words affected the English vocabulary. The Norman French words introduced by the Conquest, as well as the Parisian French words which followed under the early Plantagenets, were, the bulk of them, Latin words which had lived on among the people of Gaul, and, modified in the mouths of succeeding generations, had reached forms more or less remote from their originals. In being now adopted as English, they supplied precedents in accordance with which other Latin words without limit might be converted into English ones, whenever required; and long before the Renaissance of classical learning, though in much greater numbers after that epoch, these precedents were eagerly followed.

While the eventual though distant result of the Norman Conquest was thus a large reconstruction of the English vocabulary, the grammar of the language was not directly affected by it. There was no reason why it should,—we might almost add, no way by which it could. While the English used their own wards, they could not forget their own way of using them, the inflexions and constructions by which alone the words expressed ideas,—in other words, their grammar; when one by one French words were introduced into the sentence they became English by the very act of admission, and were at once subjected to all the duties and liabilities of English words in the same position. This is of course precisely what we do at the present day: telegraph and telegram make participle telegraphing and plural telegrams, and “scrumptious,” adverb “scrump-tiously,” precisely as if they had been in the language for ages.

But indirectly the grammar was affected very quickly. In languages in the inflected or synthetic stage the terminations must be pronounced with marked distinctness, as these contain the correlation of ideas; it is all-important to hear whether a word is bonus or bonis or boηas or bonos. This implies a measured and careful pronunciation, against which the effort for ease and rapidity of utterance is continually struggling, while indolence and carelessness continually compromise it. There has been an increasing tendency in English, as in other languages, to give each word one main accent, at or near the beginning, and to suffer the concluding syllables to fall into obscurity, We are familiar with the cockney winder, sofer, holler, Surer, Sunder, for windoiø, sofa, holla, SaraΛ, Sunday, the various final vowels sinking into an obscure neutral one conventionally spelt er. Already before the Conquest, forms originally hatu, sello, tuηga, appeared as hate, selle, tunge, with the terminations levelled to obscure e, but during the illiterate period of the language after the Conquest, this careless obscuring of terminal vowels became universal, all unaccented vowels in the final syllable (except i) sinking into e. During the 12th century, while this change was going on, we find a great confusion of grammatical forms, the full inflexions of Old English standing side by side in the same sentence with the levelled ones of Middle English. It is to this state of the language that the names Transition and Period of G onfusion (Dr Abbott’s appellation) point; its appearance, as that of Anglo-Saxon broken down in its endings, had previously given to it the suggestive if not strictly logical title of Semi-Saxon. By most writers the [9:8:394] close of the period has been brought down to 1250; but very shortly after 1200 in the south, and considerably before it in the north, the levelling of inflexions was complete, and the language possessed of a tolerably settled system of new grammatical forms, the use of which marks Middle English.

Although the written remains of the Transition Old English are few, sufficient exist to enable us to trace the course of linguistic change. Within two generations after the Conquest, faithful pens were at work transliterating the old homilies of Aelfric, and other lights of the Anglo-Saxon Church, into the neglected idiom of their posterity. Twice during the period, in the reigus of Stephen and Henry IL, Aelfric’s gospels were similarly modernized so as to be “understated of the people.” And shortly after 1100 appeared the great work of the age, the versified Chronicle of Layamon, or Lawëman, a priest of Ernely, on the Severn, who, using as his basis the French Brut of Wace, expanded it by additions of his own to more than twice the extent; his work of 32,250 lines is a mine of illustration for the language of the period. While these southern remains carry on in unbroken sequence the history of the Old English of Alfred and Aelfric, the history of the northern English is an entire blank from the 11th to the 13th century. The stubborn resistance of the north, and the terrible retaliation inflicted by William, apparently effaced northern English culture for centuries. If anything was written in the vernacular in the kingdom of Scotland during the same period, it probably perished during the calamities to which that country was subjected during the half century of struggle for independence. In reality, however, the northern English had entered its Transition or “Semi-Saxon” stage two centuries earlier; the glosses of the 10th century show that the Danish inroads had there anticipated the results hastened by the Norman Conquest in the south. Meanwhile a dialect was making its appearance in another quarter of England, destined to overshadow the old literary dialects of north and south alike, and become the English of the future. The Mercian kingdom, which, a3 its name imports, lay along the marches of the earlier states, and was really a congeries of the outlying members of many tribes, must have presented from the beginning a linguistic mixture and transition; and it is probable that more than one intermediate form of speech arose within its confines, between Lancashire and the Thames. But the only specimen of such we can with some degree of certainty produce comes towards the close of the Old English period, in the gloss to the Rushworth Gospels, which, so far as concerns St Matthew, and a fewverses of St John xviιL, is probably in a Mercian dialect. At least it presents a phase of the language which in inflexional decay stands about midway between the West-Saxon and the Northumbrian glosses, to which it is yet posterior in time. But soon after the Conquest we find an undoubted midland dialect in the Transition stage from Old to Middle English, in the south-eastern part of ancient Mercia, in a district bounded on the south and south-east by the Saxon Middlesex and Essex, and on the east and north by the East Anglian Norfolk and Suffolk and the Danish settlements on the Trent and Humber. In this -district, and in the monastery of Peterborough, one of the copies of the Old English Chronicle, transcribed about 1120, was written up by two succeeding hands to the death of Stephen in 1154. The section from 1122 to 1131, written in the latter year, shows the same confusion as in Layamon between Old English forms and those of a still simpler Middle English, impatient to rid itself of the inflexional trammels which were still, though in weakened forms, so tightly hugged south of the Thames. And in the concluding section written in 1154 we find Middle English fairly started on its career. A specimen of this new tongue will best show the change that had taken place.

1140 A.D.— And te eorl of Angaeu waerd ded, and his sune Henri toe to pe rice. And te cueu of France to-daelde fra pe king, and scae com to pe iunge eorl Henri, and he toe hire to wiue, and al Peitou mid hire, pa ferde he mid micel faerd into Engleland and wan castles— and te king ferde agenes him mid micel mare ferd. popwaethere fuhtten hi noht. oc ferden pe aercebwcop and te wise men betwux heom, and makede that salite that te king sculde ben lauerd and king wile he liuede. and aefter his daei ware Henri king, and he helde him for fader, and he him for sune. and sib and saehte sculde ben betwyx heom, and on al Engleland.^[15. Earle, Two of the Saxon Chronicles parallel, 1865, p. 265. ]

With this may be contrasted a specimen of southern English, at least 25 years later (Hatton Gospels, Luke i. 46).^[16. Skeat, Anglo-Saxon and Northumbrian Gospels, 1874. ]

The Middle English stage was pre-eminently the Dialectal period of the language. It was not till after the middle of the 14th century that English obtained official recognition as a language. For three centuries, therefore, there was no standard form of speech which claimed auy pre-eminence over the others The writers of each district wrote in the dialect familiar to them; and between extreme forms the difference was so great as to amount to unintelligibility; works written for southern Englishmen had to be translated for the benefit of the men of the north :—

“In sotherin Inglis was it drawin, And turnid ic haue it till ur awin Langage of pe northin lede That can na nothir Inglis rede.”

Cursor Mundi, 20,0G4.

Three main dialects were distinguished by contemporary writers, as in the often-quoted passage from Trevisa’s translation of Higden’s Polychronicon completed in 1387 :— “Also Englysche men hadde fram pe bygynnynge pre maner speche, Souperon, Norperon, and Myddel speche (in pe myddel of pe lond) as hy come of pre maner people of Germania Also of pe forseyde Saxon tonge, pat ys deled a pre, and ys abyde scarslyche wip feaw uplondysche men and ys gret wondur, for men of pe est wip men of pe west, as hyt were under pe same part of heyvene, acordep more in sounynge of speche pan men of pe norp wip men of pe soup; perfore hyt ys pat Mercii, pat bup men of myddel Engelond, as hyt were parteners of pe endes, undurstondep betre pe syde longages Norperon and Souperon, pan Norpern and Soupern undmstondep oyper oper.”

The modern study of these Middle English dialects, initiated by Mr Garnett, and elaborated by Dr Richard .Morris,^[17. Sec his Early English Alliterative Poems, for the Early English Text Society, 1864; Historical Outlines of English Accidence, 1870; and Elementary Lessons in Historical English Grammar 1874. ] has shown that they were readily distinguished by [9:8:395] the conjugation of the present tense of the verb, which in typical specimens was as follows :—

Southern.

Ich singe. We singe p.

pυu singest. $e singej>.

He singef>. Hy singej>.

Midland.

Ich, I, singe. We singen, pou singest. je singen.

He singep. Hy, thei, singen.

Northern.

Ic, I, syng(e). We syng(e), We J>at synges. pu synges. $e syng(e), 3e foules synges.

He synges. Thay syng(e), Men synges.

Of these the southern is simply the old West-Saxon, with the vowels levelled to e. The northern second person in -es is older than the southern and West Saxon -est ; but the -es of the third person and plural is derived from an older -eth, the change of -th into -s being found in progress in the Durham glosses of the 10th century. In the plural, when accompanied by the pronoun subject, the verb had already dropped the inflexions entirely as in Modern English. The origin of the -en plural in the midland dialect, unknown to Old English, has been a matter of conjecture; most probably it is an instance of form-levelling, the inflexion of the present indicative being assimilated to that of the past, and the present and past subjunctive, in all of which -en was the plural termination. In the declension of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, the northern dialect had attained before the end of the 13th century to the simplicity of Modern English, while the southern dialect still retained a large number of inflexions, and the midland a considerable number. The dialects differed also in phonology, for while the northern generally retained the hard or guttural values of k, g, sc, these were in the two other dialects palatalized before front vowels into ch, j, and sh. Kyrle, chirche or church; bryg, bridge; sο∙yke, shriek, are examples. The original a in stdn, mdr, preserved in the northern staηe, mare, became 0 elsewhere, as in stone, more. So that the north presented the general aspect of conservation of old sounds with the most thorough-going dissolution of old inflexions; the south, a tenacious retention of the inflexions, with an extensive revolution in the sounds. In one important respect, however, phonetic decay was far ahead in the north: the final e to which all the old vowels had been levelled during the Transition period, and which is a distinguishing feature of Middle English in the midland and southern dialects, became mute, i.e., disappeared, in the northern dialect before the latter emerged from its three centuries of obscuration, shortly before 1300." So thoroughly modern did its form consequently become that we might almost call it Modern English, and say that the Middle English stage of the northern dialect is lost. For comparison with the other dialects, however, the same nomenclature may be used, and we may class as Middle English the extensive literature which northern England produced during the 14th century. The earliest specimen is probably the Metrical Psalter in the Cotton Library,^[18. .', ^'^ed f° r the Surtees Society, by Rev. J. Stevenson. ] copied during the reign of Edward II. from an original’of the previous century. This is followed by the gigantic versified paraphrase of Scripture history called the C'wτ⅛w Λ∕wnch',^[19. Edited for the Early English Text Society, by Rev. Dr Morris. ] also composed before 1300. The dates of the numerous alliterative romances in this dialect cannot be determined with exactness, as all survive in later copies, but it is probable that many of them are not later than 1300. In the 14th century appeared the theological and devotional works of Richard Rolle the anchorite of

Hampole, Dan Jon Gaytrigg, William of Nassington, and other writers whose names are unknown; and towards the close of the century, specimens of the language also appear from Scotland both in public documents and the poetical works of John Barbour, whose language, barring minute points of orthography, is identical with that of the contemporary northern English writers.

In the southern dialect, the work of Layamon was succeeded at an interval estimated at from 15 to 25 years by the Ancren lliιcle or “Rule of Nuns,” written for a small sisterhood at Tarrant-Kaines, in Dorsetshire, in which we find the Middle English stage fully developed, and also recognize a dialectal characteristic which had probably long prevailed in the south, though concealed by the spelling, in the use of ν for f, as valle, fall, vordonne, fordo, νorto, for to, veder, father, vrom, from. Not till later do we find a recognition of the parallel use of 2 for s. Among the writings which succeed, The Owl and the Nightingale of Nicholas de Guildford, of Portesham in Dorsetshire, about 1250, the Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester, 1298, and Trevisa’s translation of Higden, 1387, are of chief importance in illustrating the history of southern English. The earliest form of Langland’s Piers Ploughman, 13G2, as preserved in the Vernon MS., appears to be in an intermediate dialect between southern and midland.^[20. The Vision of William concerning Piers the Ploughman exists in three different recensions by the author, all of which have been edited for the Early English Text Society by Rev. W. W. Skeat. ] The Kentish form of southern English seems to have retained specially archaic features; five short sermons in it of the middle of the 13th century have been published by Rev. Dr Morris; but the great work illustrating it is the Ayenbite of Inwyt (Remorse of Conscience), 1340,^[21. Edited by Rev. Dr Morris for Early English Text Society, in I860. ] of which we are told by its author Dan Michel of Northgate, Kent—

“pet ]>is boc is y-wjite mid engliss of Kent; pis hoc is y-mad uor lewede men,

Vor uader, and uor moder, and uor o]>er ken, Ham uor to berje uram alle manyere zen, pet ine hare inwytte ne bleue no uoul wen.”

In its use of v (w) and z for f and s, and its grammatical inflexions, it presents an extreme type of southern speech, with vowel peculiarities specially Kentish; and in comparison with contemporary midland English works, it looks like a fossil of two centuries earlier.

Turning from the dialectal extremes of the Middle English to the midland speech, which we left at the closing leaves of the Peterborough Chronicle of 1154, we find a rapid development of this dialect, which was before long to become the national literary language. As was natural in a tract of country which stretched from Lancaster to Essex, a very considerable variety is found in the documents which agree in presenting the leading midland features, those of Lancashire and Lincolnshire approaching the northern dialect both in vocabulary, phonetic character, and greater neglect of inflexions. But this diversity diminishes as we advance. The first great work is the 0rmulum, or metrical Scripture paraphase of 0rm or 0rmin, written about 1200, it is generally assumed, in Lincolnshire or Notts, though there is much to be said fcr the neighbourhood of Ormskirk in Lancashire. Anyhow the dialect has a decided smack of the north, and shows for the first time in English literature a large percentage of Scandinavian words, derived from the Danish settlers, who, iu adopting English, had preserved a vast number of their ancestral forms of speech, which were in time to pass into the common language, of which they now constitute some of the most familiar words. Blunt, bull, die, dwell, ill, kid, raise, same, thrive, wand, wing, ^[22. δ See a list in Mr Kington Oliphant’s Sources of Standard English, p. 97, a work in which the history of Middle English is admirably developed. ]
[9:8:396]

are words from this source, which appear first in the work of Orm, of which the following lines may be quoted :—

“pe Judewi3she folkess boc hemm sejjde,patt hemm birrde

Twa bukkes samenn to J>e preost att kirrke-dure brinngenn; And tejj pa didenn blipelij, swa summ pe boc hemm tahhte, And brohhtenn twejjenn bukkess paer Drihhtin paerwipp to lakenn.

The author of the Ormulum was a phonetist, and employed a special spelling of his own to represent not only the quality but the quantities of vowels and consonants,—a circumstance which gives his work a peculiar value to the investigator.

Thirty years after the Ormulum, the east midland rhymed Story of Genesis and Exodus ^[23. Edited for the Early English Text Society by Dr Morris, 1865. ] shows us the dialect in a more southern form, with the vowels of modern English. In 1258 was issued the celebrated English proclamation of Henry III., or rather of Simon de Montfort in his name, which, as the only public recognition of the native tongue between William the Conqueror and Edward III., has been spoken of as the first specimen of English. It runs—

“Henri purj godes fultume king on Engleneloande. Lhoauerd on Yrloande. Duk on Norma ndie on Aquitaine and eorl on Aniow Send igretinge to alle hise holde ilaerde and ileawede on Huntendoneschire. paet witen je wel aile paet ιve willen and vnnen paet paet vre raedesmen alle oper pe moare dael of heom paet beop ichosen purj us and purj paet loandes folk on vre kuneriche. habbep idon and schulten don in pe worpnesse of gode and on vre treowpe. for pe freme of pe loande. purj pe besijte of pan to-foren-iseide redesmen. beo stedefaest and ilestinde in alle pinge a buten aende.

As to the dialect of this document, it is more southern than anything else, with a slight midland admixture, and represents no doubt the London speech of the day. London being in a Saxon county, and contiguous to the Saxon Kent and Surrey, had certainly at first a southern dialect; but its position as the capital, as well as its proximity to the midland district, made its dialect more and more midland. Even in Chaucer, however, it has still southern features, for Chaucer’s language is well known to be more southern than standard English eventually became. Inflexionally, the proclamation is much more archaic than the Genesis and Exodus or Ormulum; but it closely resembles the old Kentish Sermons and Proverbs of Alfred in the southern dialect of 1250.

In the writings of the second half of this century, the language becomes rapidly more modern in aspect, till we arrive about 1300 at the name of Robert of Brunne in south Lincolnshire, with whom we pass from the Early to the Later Middle English. Different tests and different dates have indeed been proposed for subdividing the Middle English, but the most important is that of Mr Henry Nicol, based on the discovery that in the 13th century, as in 0rmin, the Old English short vowels in an open syllable still retained their short quantity, as ηama, over, mete; but by the beginning of the 14th century they were lengthened to na-me, o-ver, me-te, a change which has also taken place at a particular period in all the Teutonic, and even the Romance languages, as in buo-no for bo-num, ca-ηe for cd-nem, &c. The lengthening of the penult left the final syllable by contrast shortened or weakened, and paved the way for the disappearance of final e in the century following, through the stages na-me, ηa-me, na-m ’ , ηam, the one long syllable in nam(f) being the quantitative equivalent of the two short syllables in ηa-me ; and thus came the idea that mute e makes a preceding vowel long, the truth being that the lengthening of the vowel made the e mute. The late Middle English produced the prose of Mandeville and Wycliffe, and the poetry of Chaucer, with whom it may be said to have culminated, and in whose writingsits main characteristics as distinct from Old and Modern English may be studied. Thus, we find final e in full use representing numerous original vowels and terminations as

Him thoughts that his hertè woldè brekè, in Old English—

Him puhte paet his heorte wolde brecan, which may be compared with the modern German—

Ihm däuchte dasz sein Herze wollte brechen.

In nouns the -es of the plural and genitive case is still syllabic—

Reede as the berstl-es of a sow-es eer-es.

Several old genitives and plural forms continued to exist, and the dative or prepositional case often has a final e. Adjectives retain so much of the old declension as to have -ö in the definite form and in the plural—

The tend-re cropp-es and the yong-e sonne.

And smal-e fowl-es maken melodie.

Numerous old forms of comparison were in use, which have not come down to Modern English, as lierre, ferre, lenger, hext = higher, farther, longer, highest. In the pronouns, ich lingered alongside of I; ye was only nominative, and you objective; the northern thei had dispossessed the southern hy, but her and hem (the modern , em) stood their ground against their and them. The verb is I lov-e, thou lοv-esl, [9:8:397] he lov-eth; but in the plural loυ-en is interchanged with ↑σv-e, as rhyme or euphony requires. So in the plural of the past we love-den or love-de. The infinitive also ends in en, often e, always syllabic. The present participle, in Old English -ende, passing through -inde, has been confounded with the verbal noun in -ynge, -yng, as in Modern English. The past participle largely retains the prefix y- or i-, representing the Old English ge-, as in i-ronηe, y-dοn, run, done. Many old verb forms still continued in existence. The adoption of French words, not only those of Norman introduction, but those subsequently introduced under the Angevin kings, to supply obsolete and obsolescent English ones, which had kept pace with the growth of literature since the beginning of the Middle English period, had now reached its climax; later times added many more, but they also dropped many that were in regular use with Chaucer and his contemporaries.

Chaucer’s great contemporary, William Langland, in his Vision of William concerning Piers the Ploughman, and his imitator the author of Pierce the Ploughman’s Crede (about 1400) used the Old English alliterative versification for the last time in the south. Rhyme had made its appearance in the language shortly after the Conquest—if not already known before; and in the south and midlands it became decidedly more popular than alliteration; the latter retained its hold much longer in the north, where it was written even after 1500: many of the northern romances are either simply alliterative, or have both alliteration and rhyme. To these characteristics of northern and southern verse respectively Chaucer alludes in the prologue of the “Persone,” who, when called upon for his tale, said—

“But trusteth wel; I am a sotherne man, I cannot geste rom, ram, ruf, by my letter, And, God wote, rime hold I but litel better: And therfore, if you list, I wol not glose, I wol you tell a litel tale in prose.”

The changes from Old to Middle English may be summed up thus :—Loss of a large part of the native vocabulary, and adoption of French words to supply the blank; not infrequent adoption of French words as synonyms of existing native ones; modernization of the English words preserved, by vowel change in a definite direction from back to front, and from open to close, a becoming o, o tending to oo, τι to ou, ea to e, e to ee, ee to Σ, and by advance of consonants from guttural to palatal; obscuration of vowels after the accent, and especially of final a, o, u to e; consequent confusion and loss of old inflexions, and their replacement by prepositions, auxiliary verbs, and rules of position; abandonment of alliteration for rhyme; and great development of dialects, in consequence of there being no standard or recognized type of English.

But the recognition came at length. By the reign of Edward III., French was so little known in England, even in the families of the great, that about 1350 “John Cornwal, a maystere of gramere, chaungede pe lore in gramere scole and construccion of [i.e., from ∖ Freynsch into Englysch;”^[24. Trevisa, Translation of Higden's Ρυhjelιronw>n. ] and in 1362-3 English by statute took the place of French in the pleadings in courts of law. Every reason conspired that this “English” should be the midland dialect. It was the intermediate dialect, intelligible, as Trevisa has told us, to both extremes, even when these failed to be intelligible to each other; in its south-eastern form, it was the language of London, where the supreme law courts were, the centre of political and commercial life; it was the language in which the Wycliffite versions had given the Holy Scriptures to the people; the language in which Chaucer had raised English poetry to a height of excellence admired and imitated by contemporaries and followers. And accordingly after the end of the 14th century, all Englishmen who thought they had anything to say worth listening to said it in the midland speech Trevisa’s own work was almost the last literary effort of the southern dialect; henceforth it was but a rustic patois, which the dramatist might use to give local colouring to his creations, as Shakespeare uses it to complete Edgar’s peasant disguise in Lear, or which 19 th century research might disinter to illustrate obscure chapters in the history of language. And though the northern English proved a little more stubborn, it disappeared also from literature in England; but in Scotland, which had now become politically and socially estranged from England, it continued its course as the national language of the country, attaining in the 15th and 16th centuries a distinct development and high literary culture, for the details of which readers are referred to the article on Scottish Language.

The 15th century of English history, with its bloody French war abroad, and Wars of the Roses at home, was a barren period in literature, and a transition one in language, witnessing the decay and disappearance of the final e, and most of the syllabic inflexions of Middle English. Already by 1420, in Chaucer’s disciple Hoccleve, final e was quite uncertain; in Lydgate it was practically gone. In 1450 the writings of Pecocke against the Wycliffites show the verbal inflexions in -en in a state of obsolescence; he has still the southern pronouns her and hem for the northern their, them:—

“And here-ajens holi scripture wole pat men schulden lacke pe coueryng which wommen schulden haue, & thei schulden so lacke bi pat pe heeris of her heedis schulden be schorne, & schulde not growe in lengpe doun as wommanys heer schulde growe

“Also here-wipal into pe open sijt of ymagis in open chirchis, alie peple, men & wommen & children mowe come whanne euere pei wolen in ech tyme of pe day, but so mowe pei not come in-to pe vce of bokis to be delyuered to hem neiper to be red bifore hem; & perfore, as for to soone & ofte come into remembraunce of a long mater bi ech oon persoon, and also as forto make pat pe mo persoones come into remembraunce of a mater, ymagis & picturis serven in a speci aler maner pan bokis doon, pouj in an oper maner fui substanciali bokis seruen better into remembrauncing of po same materis pan ymagis & picturis doon; & perfore, pouj writingis seruen weel into remembrauncing upon pe bifore seid pingis, jit not at pe ful: Forwhi pe bokis han not pe avail of remembrauncing now seid whiche ymagis han.”^[25. Skeat, Specimens of English Literature, p. 49, 54. ]

The change of the language during the second period of Transition, as well as the extent of dialectal differences, is quaintly expressed a generation later by Caxton, who in the prologue to one of the last of his works, his translation of Virgil’s Enegdos (1490), speaks of the difficulty he had in pleasing all readers :—

“I doubted that it sholde not please some gentylmen, whiche late blamed me, sayeng, y t in my translacyons I had ouer curyous termes, whiche coud not be vnderstände of comyn peple, and desired me to vse olde and homely termes in my translacyons. And fayn wolde I satysfy euery man; and so to doo, toke an olde boke and redde therin; and certaynly the englysshe was so rude and brood that I coude not wele vnderstande it. And also my lorde abbot of Westmynster ded do shewe to me late certayn euydences wryton in olde englysshe for to reduce it in to our englysshe now vsid. And certaynly it was wreton in suche wyse that it was more lyke to dutche than englysshe; I coude not reduce ne brynge it to be vnderstonden. And [9:8:398] certaynly, our langage now vsed varyeth ferre from that whiche was vsed and spoken λvhan I was borne. For we englysshemen ben borne vnder the domynacyon of the mone, whiche is neuer stedfaste, but euer wauerynge, wex-ynge one season, and waneth and dycreaseth another season, And that comyn englysshe that is spoken in one shyre varyeth from a nother. In so much that in my days happened that certayn marchauntes were in a shipe in tamyse, for to haue sayled ouer the sea into zelande, and for lacke of wynde thei taryed atte forlond, and wente to lande for to refreshe them. And one of theym named sheffelde, a mercer, cam in to an hows and axed for mete, and specy-ally he axyd after eggys, And the goode wyf answerde, that she coude speke no frenshe. And the marchaunt was angry, for he also coude speke no frenshe, but wolde haue hadde egges; and she vnderstode hym not. And thenne at laste a nether sayd that he wolde haue eyren; then the good wyf sayd that she vnderstod hym wel. Loo! what sholde a man in tlιyse dayes now wryte, egges or eyren? certaynly, it is harde to playse euery man, by cause of dyuersite & chaunge of langage. For in these dayes, euery man that is in ony reputacyon in his countre wyll vtter his comynycacyon and maters in suche maners & termes that fewe men shall vnderstonde theym. And som honest and grete clerke3 haue ben wyth me, and desired me to wryte the moste curyous termes that I coude fynde. And thus bytwene playn, rude, and curyous, I stande abasshed; but in my Judgemente, the comyn termes that be dayli vsed ben lyghter to be vnderstonde than the olde and auncyent englysshe.”

In the productions of Caxton’s press, we see the passage from Middle to Modern English completed. The earlier of these have still an occasional verbal plural in -n, especially in the word they ben; the southern her and hem of Middle English vary with the northern and Modern English their, them. In the late works, the older forms have been practically ousted, and the year 1485, which witnessed the establishment of the Tudor dynasty, may be conveniently put as that which closed the Middle English transition, and introduced Modern English. Both in the completion of this result, and in its comparative permanence, the printing press had an important share. By its exclusive patronage of the midland speech, it raised it still higher above the sister dialects, and secured its abiding victory. As books were multiplied and found their way into every corner of the land, and the art of reading became a more common acquirement, the man of Northumberland or of Somersetshire had forced upon his attention the b00k-Engli3h in which alone these were printed. This became in turn the model for his own writings, and by and by, if he made any pretensions to education, of his own speech. The written form of the language also tended to uniformity. In previous periods the scribe made his own spelling with a primary aim at expressing his own speech, according to the particular values attached by himself or his contemporaries to the letters and combinations of the alphabet, though liable to disturbance in the most common words and combinations by his ocular recollections of the spelling of others. But after the introduction of printing, this ocular recognition of words became ever more and more an aim; the book addressed the mind directly through the eye, instead of circuitously through eye and ear; and thu3 there was a continuous tendency for written words and parts of words to be reduced to a single form, and that the most usual, or through some accident the best known, but not necessarily that which would have been chosen had the ear been called in as umpire. Modern English spelling, with its rigid uniformity as to individual results and whimsical caprice as to principles, is the creation of the printing-office, the victory which, after a Century and a half of struggle, mechanical convenience won over natural habits. Besides eventually creating a uniformity in writing, the introduction of printing made or at least ratified some important changes. The British and Old English form of the Roman alphabet has already been referred to. This at the Norman Conquest was superseded by an alphabet with the French forms and values of the letters. Thus k took the place of the older c before e and i; qu replaced cw; the Norman w took the place of the wen (p), Ac. But there were certain sounds in English for which Norman writing had no provision; and for these, in writing English, the native characters were retained. Thus the Old English g (5), beside the sound in go, had a guttural sound as in German tay, Irish mayΛ, and in certain positions a palatalized form of this approaching y as in you (if pronounced with aspiration Λyou or yλyou). These sounds continued to be written with the native form of the letter as bury pur, while the French form was used for the sounds in go, age,— one original letter being thus split into two. So for the sounds of th, especially the sound in iΛat, the Old English thorn (p) continued to be used. But as these characters were not used for French and Latin, their use even in English became disturbed towards the 15th century, and when printing was introduced, the founts, cast for Continental languages, had no characters for them, so that they disappeared entirely, being replaced, j by gh, yh, y, and p by th. This was a real loss to the English alphabet. In the north it is curious that the printers tried to express the forms rather than the powers of these letters, and consequently 3 was represented by 2, the black letter form of which was confounded with it, while the p was expressed by y, which its MS. form had come to approach or in some cases simulate. So in early Scotch books we find zellow, ze, yat, yem, — yellow, ye, that, them. Modern English thus dates from Caxton. The language had at length reached the all but inflexionless state which it now presents. A single older verbal form, the southern -eth of the third person singular, continued to be the literary prose form throughout the 16th century, but the northern form in -s was intermixed with it in poetry (where it saved a syllable), and must ere long, as we see from Shakespeare, have taken its place in familiar speech. The fuller an, none, mine, thine., in the early part of the 16th century at least, were used in positions where their contracted form3 a, no, my, thy are now found. But with such minute exceptions, the accidence of the 16th century was the accidence of the 19th. While, however, the older inflexions had disappeared, there was as yet no general agreement as to the mode of their replacement. Hence the 16th century shows a syntactic licence and freedom which distinguishes it strikingly from that of later times. The language seems to be in a plastic, unformed state, and its writers, as it were, experiment with it, bending it to constructione which now seem indefensible. Old distinctions of case and mood have disappeared from noun and verb, without fashion having yet decided what prepositions or auxiliary verbs shall most fittingly convey their meaning. The laxity of word-order which was permitted in older states of the language by the formal expression of relations was often continued though the inflexions which expressed the relations had disappeared. Partial analogy was followed in allowing forms to be identified in one case, because, in another, such identification was accidentally produced, as for instance the past participles of write and take were made wrote and took, because the contracted participles of bind and break were bound and broke. Finally, because, in dropping inflexions, the former distinctions even between parts of speech had disappeared, so that iron, e.g., was at once noun, adjective.

and verb, clean, adjective, verb, and adverb, it appeared as if any word whatever might be used in any grammatical relation, where it conveyed the idea of the speaker. Thus, as has been pointed out by Dr Abbott, “you can happy your friend, malice or foot your enemy, or fall an axe on his neck. You can speak and act easy, free, excellent, you can talk of fair instead of beauty (fairness), and a pale instead of a paleness. A he is used for a man, and a lady is described by a gentleman as ‘the fairest she he has yet beheld.’ An adverb can be used as a verb, as ‘ they askance their eyes; ’ as a noun, ‘ the backward and abyss of time;’ or as an adjective, a ‘ seldom pleasure.’ "^[26. .1 Shαkspeαriαn Grammar, by E. A. Abbott, M.A. To this book we are largely indebted for its admirable summary of the characters of Tudor English. ] For, as he also says, “clearness was preferred to grammatical correctness, and brevity both to correctness and clearness. Hence it was common to place words in the order in which they came uppermost in the mind without much regard to syntax, and the result was a forcible and perfectly unambiguous but ungrammatical sentence, such as

The prince that feeds great natures they will slay him. Ben Jonson. or, as instances of brevity,

Be guilty of my death since of my crime.

» Shakespeare.

It cost more to get than to lose in a day.

Ben Jonson."

These characteristics, together with the presence of words now obsolete or archaic, and the use of existing words in senses different from our own, as general for specific, literal for metaphorical, and vice versa, which are so apparent to every reader of the 16th century literature, make it useful to separate Early Modern or Tudor English from the subsequent and still existing stage, since the consensus of usage has declared in favour of individual senses and constructions which are alone admissible in ordinary language.

The commencement of the Tudor period was contemporaneous with the Renaissance in art and literature, and the dawn of modem discoveries in geography and science. The revival of the study of the classical writers of Greece and Rome, and the translation of their works into the vernacular, led to the introduction of an immense number of new words derived from these languages, either to express new ideas and objects, or to indicate new distinctions in or groupings of old ideas. Often also it seemed as if scholars were so pervaded with the form as well as the spirit of the old, that it came more natural to them to express themselves in words borrowed from the old than in their native tongue, and thus words of Latin origin were introduced even when English already possessed perfectly good equivalents. As lias already been stated, the French words of Norman and Angevin introduction, being principally Latin words in an altered form, when used as English supplied models whereby other Latin words could be converted into English ones, and it is after these models that the Latin words introduced during and since the 1βth century have been fashioned. There is nothing in the form of the words procession and progression to show that the one was used in England in the 11th, the other not till the 16th century. Moreover, as the formation of new words from Latin has gone on in French as well as in English since the Renaissance, we cannot tell whether such words, e.g , as persuade and persuasion, were borrowed from their French equivalents or formed in England independently. With some words indeed it is impossible to say whether they were formed in England directly from Latin, borrowed from contemporary late French, or had been in England since the Norman period; even photograph, geology, and telephone have the form that they would have had if thev had been living words in the mouths of Greeks, Latins, French, and English from the beginning, instead of formations of the 19th century.^[27. Evangelist, astronomy, dialogue, are words that have so lived, of which their form is the result. Photograph, &c., take this form as if they had the same history. ] While every writer was thus introducing new words according to his idea of their being needed, it naturally happened that a large number were not accepted by contemporaries or posterity; a porteutous list might be formed of these mintages of the 16th and 17th centuries, which either never became current coin, or circulated only as it were for a moment.

The voyages of English navigators in the latter part of the 16th century also introduced a considerable number of Spanish words, and American words in Spanish forms, of which potato, tobacco, cargo, armadillo, alligator, galleon may serve as examples.

The date of 1611, which coincides with the end of Shakespeare’s literary work and the appearance of the Authorized Version of the Bible (a compilation from the various 16th century versions), may be taken as marking the close of Tudor English. The language was thenceforth Modern in structure, style, and expression, although the spelling did not settle down to present usage till about the Restoration. The distinctive features of Modern English have already been anticipated by way of contrast with preceding stages of the language. It is only necessary to-refer to the fact that the vocabulary is now much more composite than at any previous period. The immense development of the physical sciences has called for a corresponding extension of terminology which has been supplied from Latin and especially Greek; and although these terms are in the first instance technical, yet with the spread of education and general diffusion of the rudiments and appliances of science, the boundary line between technical and general, indefinite at the best, tends more and more to melt away, in addition to the fact that words still technical become general in figurative or metonymic senses. AcΛe, diamond, stomach, comet, organ, tone, ball, carte, are none the less familiar because once technical words. Commercial, social, artistic, or literary contact has also led to the adoption of numerous words from modern European languages, especially French, Italian, Portuguese, Dutch (these two at a less recent period): thus from French soirée, séance, depot, debris, programme, prestige; from Italian bust, cartoon, concert, regatta, ruffian; from Portuguese caste, palaver; from Dutch yacht, skipper, schooner, sloop. Commercial intercourse and colonization have extended far beyond Europe, and given us words more or fewer from Hindu, Persian, Arabic, Turkish, Malay, Chinese, and from American, Australian, Polynesian, and African languages.^[28. See extended lists of the foreign words in English in Dr Morris's Historical Outlines of English Accidence, p. 33. ] More important even than these perhaps are the dialectal words that from time to time obtain literary recognition, restoring to us obsolete Old English forms, and not seldom words of Celtic or Danish origin, which have been preserved in local dialects, and thus at length find their way into the standard language. As to the actual proportion of the various elements, it is probable that original English words do not now form more than a third or perhaps a fourth of the total entries in a full English dictionary; and it might seem strange, therefore, that we still identify the language with that of the 9th century, and class it as a member of the Low German division. But this explains itself, when we consider that of the total words in a dictionary only a small portion are used by any one individual in speaking or even in writing; that this portion includes all or nearly all the Anglo-Saxon words, and but a small fraction of [9:8:400] the others. The latter are in fact almost all names,— the vast majority names of things (nouns), a smaller number names of attributes and actions (adjectives and verbs), and, from their very nature, names of the things, attributes, and actions which come less usually or very rarely under our notice. Thus in an ordinary book, a novel or story, the foreign elements will amount to from 10 to 15 per cent, of the whole; as the subject becomes more recondite or technical their number will increase; till in a work on chemistry or abstruse mathematics the proportion may be 40 per cent. But after all, it is not the question whence words may have been taken, but how they are used in a language that settles its character. If new words when adopted conform themselves to the manner and usage of the adopting language, it makes absolutely no difference whether they are transferred from some other language, or invented off at the ground. In either case they are new words to begin with; in either case also, if they are needed, they will become as thoroughly native, i.e., familiar from childhood to those who use them, as those that possess the longest native pedigree. In this respect English is still strictly the same language it was in the days of Alfred; and comparing its history with that of other Low German dialects, there is no reason to believe that its grammar or structure would have been different, however different its vocabulary might have been, if the Norman Conquest had never taken place.

The preceding sketch has had reference mainly to the inflexional changes which the language has undergone; distinct from, though intimately connected with these (as where the confusion or loss of inflexions was a consequence of the weakening of final sounds) are the great phonetic changes which have taken place between the 8th and 19th centuries, and which result in making modern English words very different from their Anglo-Saxon originals, even where no element has been lost, as in words like stone, mine, doom, day, child, bridge, shoot, A.-S. stan, min, dom, doeg, cild, brycg, sceδt. The history of English sounds has been treated at length by Mr A. J. Ellis and Mr Henry Sweet^[29. See list of works at the end of this article. An important work by Mr Henry Nicol, on the history of “French Sounds in English,” is in course of publication for the Philological Society. ] (with whose results those of Dr Weymouth^[30. On Early English Pronunciation, &c., by R. F. Weymouth, D. Lit, Μ. A., London, 1874, and paper On “Here" and “There" in Chaucer, Phil. Soc., 1877. ] should be compared); and it is only necessary here to indicate the broad facts, which are the following. (1) In an accented closed syllable, original short vowels have remained nearly unchanged; thus the words at, men, bill, God, dust, are pronounced now nearly as in O. E., though the last two were more like the Scotch o and North English u respectively, and in most words the short a had a broader sound like the provincial a in mam (2) Long accented vowels and diphthongs have undergone a regular laut-verschiebung or shift towards higher and more advanced positions, so that the words ban, hoer, soece or sece, stol (i.e., bahn or bawn, her, sole and saik, stole) are now bone, hair, seek, stool; while the two high vowels ύ ( = oo) and i (ee) have become diphthongs, as has, scir, now house, shire, though the old sound of u remains in the north (hoose), and the original i in the pronunciation sheer, approved by Walker, “as in machine, and shire, and magazine.” (3) Short vowels in an open syllable have usually been lengthened, as in nd-ma, cbfa, now name, cove; but to this there are many exceptions. (4) Vowels in terminal unaccented syllables have all sunk into short obscure è, and then, if final, disappeared; so oxa, seo, wudu, became ox-e, se-e, wood-e, and then ox, see, wood; oxan, lufod, now oxen, loved, lov'd; writan, writon, later writ-en, writ-e, now write, i.e., writ. (5) The back con sonants, c, g, sc, in connection with front vowels, have often become palatalized to cä, j, sh, as circe, rycg, fisc, now church, ridge, fish. A final g has passed through a guttural or palatal continuant to w or y, forming a diphthong or new vowel, as in boga, laga, doeg, heg, dτig, now bow, law, day, hay, dry. W and h have disappeared before r and l, as in write, wl·isp; h final (=gh) has become f, k, w, or nothing, as ruh, hoh, boh, deah, hedh, now rough, hough, bough, dough, high = ruf, hok, bow, dδ, hi. Ii after a vowel has practically disappeared in standard English, or at most become vocalized, or combined with the vowel, as in hear, bar, more, her. These and other changes have taken place gradually, and in accordance with well-known phonetic laws; the details as to time and mode may be studied in the special works already named. It may be mentioned that the total loss of grammatical gender in English, and the almost complete disappearance of cases, are purely phonetic phenomena. Gender was practically (whatever its remote origin) the use of adjectives and pronounβ with certain distinctive terminations, in accordance with the kind of nouns to which they were attached; when these distine tive terminations were uniformly levelled to final e, or other-weak sounds, and thus ceased to distinguish nouns into kinds, the distinction into kinds having no other existence disappeared. Thus when J>cri gode hors, pone godan hund, pa godαn boc, became, by phonetic weakening, pe goode hors, pe goode hownd, pe goode boke, the words horse, hound, book were no longer different kinds of nouns; grammatical gender had ceased to exist. The concord of the pronouns is now regulated by rationality and sex, instead of gender, which has no existence in English. The man who lost his life; the bird which built its nest.

Our remarks from the end of the 14th century have been confined to the standard or literary form of English, for of the other dialects from that date (with the exception of the northern English in Scotland, where it became in a social and literary sense a distinct language), we have no history. We know, however, that they continued to exist as local and popular forms of speech, as well from the fact that they exist still as from the statements of writers during the interval. Thus Puttenham in his Arte of English Poesie, 1589, says—

“Our maker [i.e., poet] therfore at these dayes shall not follow Piers Plowman, nor Gower, nor Lydgate, nor yet Chaucer, for their language is now not of use with us: neither shall he take the termes of Northern-men, such as they use in dayly talke, whether they be noble men or gentle men or of their best clarkes, all is a [ = one] matter; nor in effect any speach used beyond the river of Trent, though no man can deny but that theirs is the purer English Saxon at this day, yet it is not so Courtly nor so currant as our Southerns English is, no more is the far Westerne mans speach: ye shall therefore take the usual speach of the Court, and that of London and the shires lying about London within lx myles, and not much above. I say not this but that in every shyre of England there be gentlemen and others that speake but specially write as good Sou theme as we of Middlesex or Surrey do, but not the common people of every shire, to whom the gentlemen, and also their learned clarkes do for the most part condescend, but herein we are already ruled by th’ English Dictionaries and other bookes written by learned men.”— Arbeds Reprint, p. 157.

In comparatively modern times, there has been a revival of interest in these long-neglected forms of English, several of which, following in the wake of the revival of Lowland Scotch last century, have produced a considerable literature in the form of local poems, tales, and “folk-lore.” In these respects Lancashire, Cumberland, Yorkshire, Devonshire, and Dorsetshire, the “far north” and “far west” of Puttenham, where the dialect was felt to be so independent of literary English as not to be branded as a vulgar corruption. of it, stand prominent. More recently the dialects have been investigated philologically, a department in which, as in English philology generally, the name of Richard Garnett takes the lead. The work has been [9:8:401] carried out zealously by Γrince Louis Lucien Bonaparte, Mr A. J. Ellis, and the Rev. W. W. Skeat, to whom is due the foundation of a Dialect Society for the investigation of this branch of philology. The researches of Prince L. L. Bonaparte and Mr Ellis have resulted in the classification and mapping of the existing dialects.^[31. See description and map in Trans, of Philol. Soc., 1875-6, p. 570. ] They recognize a Northern dialect lying north of a line drawn from Morecambe Bay to the Humber, which, with the kindred Scottish dialects (already investigated and classed),^[32. The Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland, its Pronunciation, Grammar, and Historical Relations, with an Appendix on the present limits of the Gaelic and Lowland Scotch, and the Dialectal Divisions of the Lowland Tongue; and a Linguistical Map of Scotland, by James A. H. Murray, London, 1873. ] is the direct descendant of early northern English, and a South-western dialect occupying Somerset, Wilts, Dorset, Gloucester, and western Hampshire, which, with the Devonian dialect beyond it, are the descendants of early southern English and the still older West-Saxon of Alfred. This dialect must in the 14th century have been spoken everywhere south of Thames; but the influence of London caused its extinction in Surrey, Sussex, and Kent, so that already in Puttenham it had become “far western.” An East Midland dialect, extending from south Lincolnshire to London, occupies the cradle-land of the standard English speech, and still shows least variation from it. Between and around these typical dialects are ten others, representing the old Midland proper, or dialects between it and the others already mentioned. Thus “north of Trent” the North-western dialect of south Lancashire, Cheshire, Derby, and Stafford, with that of Shropshire, represents the early West Midland English, of which several specimens remain; while the North-eastern of Nottingham and north Lincolnshire represents the dialect of the Lay of Havelok. With the North Midland dialect of south-west Yorkshire, these represent forms of speech which to the modern Londoner, as to Puttenham, are still decidedly northern, though properly intermediate between northern and midland, and preserving interesting traces of the midland pronouns and verbal inflexions. There is an Eastern dialect in the East Anglian counties; a Midland in Leicester and Warwick shires; a Western in Hereford, Worcester, and north Gloucestershire, intermediate between south-western and north-western, and representing the dialect of Piers Plowman. Finally, between the east midland and south-western, in the counties of Buckingham, Oxford, Berks, Hants, Surrey, and Sussex, there is a dialect which must have once been south-western, but of which the most salient characters have been rubbed off by proximity to London and the East Midland speech. In east Sussex and Kent this South-eastern dialect attains to a more distinctive character. The Kentish form of early Southern English evidently maintained its existence more toughly than that of the counties immediately south of London. If we can trust the fidelity of the dialect attributed to Edgar in Lear, it was still strongly marked in the days of Shakespeare. In the south-eastern corner of Ireland, in the baronies of Forth and Bargy, in county Wexford, a very archaic form of English, of which specimens have been preserved,^[33. A Glossary (with some pieces of Verse) of the Old Dialect of the English Colony of Forth and Bargy, collected by Jacob Poole, edited by W. Barnes, B.D., London, 1867. ] was still spoken in the present century. In all probability it dated from the first English invasion. In many parts of Ulster forms of Lowland Scotch dating to the settlement under James I. are still spoken; but the English of Ireland generally seems to represent 16th and 17th century English, as in the pronunciation of tea, wheat (jay, whaic), largely affected of course by the native Celtic. Beyond the limits of the

British Isles, English is the language of extensive regions, now or formerly colonies. In all these countries the presence of numerous new objects and new conditions of life has led to the supplementing of the vocabulary by the adoption of words from native languages, and special adaptation of English words. The use of a common literature, however, prevents the overgrowth of these local peculiarities, and also makes them familiar to Englishmeu. It is only in the older states of the American Union that anything like a local dialect has been produced; and even there the so-called Yankee dialect, and Americanisms, are much more archaic English forms which have been lost or have become dialectal in England than a development of the American soil.

The steps by which English, from being the language of a few thousand invaders along the eastern and southern seaboard of Britain, has been diffused by conquest and colonization over its present area form a subject too large for the limits of this article. It need only be remarked that within the confines of Britain itself the process is not yet complete. Representatives of earlier languages survive in Wales and the Scottish Highlands, though in neither case can the substitution of English be remote. In Ireland, where English was introduced by conquest much later, Irish is still spoken in patches all over the country: though English is understood, and probably spoken after a fashion, everywhere. At opposite extremities of Britain the Cornish of Cornwall and the Norse dialects of Orkney and Shetland died out very gradually in the course of last century. The Manx, or Celtic of Man, is even now in the last stage of dissolution: and in the Channel Isles the Norman patois of Jersey and Guernsey have largely yielded to English within the last thirty years.

The accompanying table (page 402) will graphically represent the chronological and dialectal development of English.^[34. Brought before the Philological Society in January 1876. ] Various names have been proposed for the different stages; it seems only necessary to add to those in the table the descriptive names of Dr Abbott, who has proposed (How to Parse, p. 298) to call the Old English, or Anglo-Saxon, the “Synthetical or Inflexional Period the Old English Transition (Late Anglo-Saxon of Mr Skeat), the “Period of Confusion;” the Early Middle English, “Analytical Period” (1250-1350); the Late Middle English, “National Period” (1350-1500); the Tudor English, “Period of Licence;” and the Modern English, “Period of Settlement.”

The three vertical lines represent the three leading forms of English, Northern, Midland, and Southern, and ehe names occurring down the course of each are those of writers and works in that form of English at the given date. The thickness of the line shows the comparative literary position of this form of speech at the time, thick indicating a literary language, medium a literary dialect, thin a popular dialect or patois; a dotted line shows that this period is unrepresented by specimens. The horizontal lines divide the periods; these (after the first two) refer mainly to the Midland English; in inflexional decay the Northern English was at least a century in advance of the Midland, and the Southern nearly as much behind it.
