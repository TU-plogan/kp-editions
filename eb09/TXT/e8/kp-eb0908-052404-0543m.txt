ERIPHYLE, in Greek mythology, the wife of the seer Amphiaraus, whom the Argive chief Adrastus took with him to Thebes, because a prophecy had said that that city could not otherwise be taken. Not wishing to meddle in a quarrel which was not his own, Amphiaraus was compelled, by a promise which he had previously given to Adrastus, to abide by the decision of Eriphyle; and Eriphyle had been bribed by Polynices, the son of Oedipus, with the gift of the necklace of Harmonia, to pronounce in favour of the expedition. Thus constrained to go, the seer charged his sons to slay their mother if they should hear of his death, and to march against Thebes. The enterprise of Adrastus, known as the first Theban war, failed, and the earth opening swallowed Amphiaraus in his chariot. His son Alcmaeon upon this slew his mother, whose Erinysgave him no rest until he surrendered to Phoebus the necklace of Harmonia and found out a spot to dwell in on which the sun had never shone at the time of Eriphyleâ€™s death. Such a place of banishment he found on the islands called Oeniadae, which had grown up at the mouth of the river Achelous from the deposits brought down by its stream. Here he married Callirhoe, the daughter of the river god, who causes his death at the hands of the sons of Phegeus by insisting on his fetching her the necklace of Eriphyle.
