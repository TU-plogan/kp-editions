EVANGELICAL ALLIANCE, an association of different Christian denominations formed in London in August 1846, at a conference of more than 800 clergymen and laymen from all parts of the world, and embracing upwards of fifty sections of the Protestant church. Though the proposal for an alliance was first mooted in England, it ultimately obtained wide support in other countries, more especially in America, and organizations in connexion with it now exist in the different capitals throughout the world. The object of the Alliance, according to a resolution of the first conference, is “to enable Christians to realize in themselves and to exhibit to others that a living and everlasting union binds all true believers together in the fellowship of the church.” At the same conference the following was adopted as the basis of the Alliance :—“Evangelical views in regard to the divine inspiration, authority, and sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures; the right and duty of private judgment in the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures; the unity of the Godhead and the Trinity of persons therein; the utter depravity of human nature in consequence of the fall; the incarnation of the Son of God, His work of atonement for sinners of mankind, and His mediatorial intercession and reign; the justification of the sinner by faith alone; the work of the Holy Spirit in the conversion and sanctification of the sinner; the immortality of the soul, the resurrection of the body, the judgment of the world by our Lord Jesus Christ, with the eternal blessedness of the righteous and the eternal punishment of the wicked; the divine institution of the Christian ministry, and the obligation and perpetuity of the ordinances of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper;”—it being understood, however, 1st, that such a summary “is not to be regarded in any formal or ecclesiastical sense as a creed or confession;” and 2d, that “the selection of certain tenets, with the omission of others, is not to be held as implying that the former constitute the whole body of important truth, or that the latter are unimportant.” Annual conferences of branches of the Alliance are held in England, America, and several Continental countries; and it is provided that a general conference, including representatives of the whole Alliance, be held every seventh year, or offener if it be deemed necessary. Such conferences have been held in London in 1851; Paris, 1855; Berlin, 1857; Geneva, 1861; Amsterdam, 1867; New York, 1873. They are occupied with the discussion chiefly of the “best methods of counteracting infidelity,” promoting Christian union, organizing Christian agencies, and generally advancing the cause of Christianity,—every subject being avoided which might give rise to any serious divergence of opinion among the members. The various organizations of the Alliance lend their aid to any department of Christian effort requiring special help; and on several occasions their influence ha3 been advantageously employed in cases of religious persecution.
