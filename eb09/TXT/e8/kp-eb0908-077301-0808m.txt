EVORA, a city of Portugal, capital of the province of Alemtejo, is situated on an eminence in the centre of a fertile plain, 85 miles E. by S. of Lisbon. It is surrounded by ramparts flanked with towers, and has two forts, but all in a ruinous condition, and quite useless as means of defence. The streets are narrow, crooked, and filthy, and the houses old and ill-built. The cathedral is a magnificent Gothic edifice with an altar in the Italian style, extremely rich, and decorated with variously coloured marbles. Evora is the see of an archbishop, and besides the cathedral has several churches, convents, and hospitals, a house of charity, barracks, a diocesan school, and a museum. A university, founded in 1550, was abolished on the expulsion of the Jesuits in the 18th century. An ancient aqueduct and an ancient tower, till a few years ago in pretty good preservation, have been partly demolished to make room for a market. They were long believed to iâˆ£ave been of Roman origin, but are now known to have been constructed about 1540 in the reign of Don John III., at the instance of an antiquarian named Resende. The aqueduct was constructed on the site of the old Roman one. The remains of what is said to have been a temple of Diana still exist, but the place is now used as a slaughter-house. Evora, under the name of Ebora, was an important military station in the time of the Romans, and was called Liberalitas Julice on account of certain municipal privileges bestowed on it by Caesar. In 712 it was conquered by the Moors and named Jabura, but they were deprived of it in 1162 by an order of Christian knights.
