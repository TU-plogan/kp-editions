ENOCH. Four persons of this name are mentioned in the Old Testament Scriptures. The first was the eldest son of Cain, who called a city which he built by the same name as his first-born (Gen. iv. 17). In the English Authorized Version Enoch appears, in the form Hanoch, as the name of the eldest son of Reuben (Gen. xlvi. 9) ancl of a son of Midian (Gen. xxv. 4). The name is most familiar, however, as that of the son of Jared and the father of Methusaleh, whose life is told in Gen. v. 18-24, and further illustrated in Heb. xi. 5. The evident meaning of the two passages taken together is that Enoch, after a life of close intercourse with the spiritual world, which lasted for 365 years, was translated to heaven without dying. The symbolic meaning of the numbers connected with his life has not escaped notice. He was “the seventh from Adam” (Jude 14), and this has been held to typify his perfection. On the fact that his years are the same in number as the days of an ordinary solar year a mythical interpretation of the story of his life has been offered which seems more ingenious than sound. According to this, Enoch is the god of the new year. The year “is not” at the .end of 365 days, but is immediately renewed. Enoch’s chief importance in Old Testament history consists in the fact that along with Elijah he is a palpable witness to the doctrine of immortality. Later traditions, founded probably on the apocryphal book which bears his name, represent him as the inventor of arithmetic and astronomy. On the book of Enoch, see Apocalyptic Literature, vol. ii. p. 175.
