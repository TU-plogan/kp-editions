EVAGORAS, king of Salamis, is said to have been descended from a family who claimed Teucer, brother of Ajax, as their progenitor, and who for a long period had been rulers of Salamis until expelled by a Phoenician exile. Evagoras, notwithstanding the expulsion of his ancestors, seems to have been born at Salamis, and lived there till the throne was again usurped by a Cyprian noble,— when, either from a prudent resolve to avoid the possibility of danger, or on account of information which he received of the usurper’s designs against his life, he fled to Cilicia. Thence he returned secretly to Salamis in 410 B.c.; and, having with the aid of a small band of adherents overpowered the guards of the palace and put the tyrant to death, he mounted the throne. According to Isocrates, Evagoras was a just and wise ruler, whose aim was to promote alike the general wellbeing of his state and the welfare of his individual subjects, and this not merely by an increase of wealth and of the luxuries which it can provide, but by the cultivation of the Grecian arts of refinement and civilization, which had been almost obliterated in Salamis by a long period of barbarian rule. He endeavoured in every way to promote friendly relations with the Athenians, and after the defeat of the Athenian general Conon at Aegospotami, he gave him refuge and a cordial reception. He also endeavoured, at least for a time, to secure the friendship of Persia, and concluded a treaty with Artaxerxes II., whose aid he secured for the Athenians against Lacedaemon. Conjointly with the Persians and Athenians, he assisted in gaining the battle of Cnidus, 394 B.C., and for this service his statue was placed by the Athenians side by side with that of their general Conon in the Ceramicus. Not long after this his friendly relations with Persia seem to have been annulled, very probably because the Persian monarch was jealous of his enterprising and independent spirit, and of his increasing influence. Direct war between him and Persia did not, however, occur until after the peace negotiated by Antalcidas, 387; but he took advantage of the Persians being otherwise engaged to extend his rule over the greater part of Cyprus, and to stir up revolt among the Cilicians. As soon as the Persians were free t 4 o devote their whole attention to him, these acts were speedily revenged. He was totally defeated by a largely superior Persian force, and compelled to flee to Salamis, which the Persians closely invested, and in all probability would soon have succeeded in capturing, had not dissensions broken out between the two generals, of which Evagoras took advantage to conclude a peace with one of them. By the terms of this peace, Evagoras was allowed to remain nominal king of Salamis, but apparently under the authority of Persia, and at all events with his independence, if not altogether overthrown, at least very much crippled. About ten years after this, [9:8:725] 374 B.C., Evagoras was assassinated by a eunuch from motives of private revenge.
