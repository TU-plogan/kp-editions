EL-GOLEA, a town on the southern frontiers of Algeria, in that part of the Sahara which bears the name of El-erg, about 160 miles S.W. of Wargla, in 30° 35' N. lat. and 3° 10' E. Ion. It consists of three portions—the citadel on a limestone hill, the upper town, and the lower town, each separated from the others by irregular plantations of date trees. In itself it is of no particular interest, but its position makes it a very important station for the caravan trade between Algeria and the countries to the south. It was originally a settlement of the Zenâta Berbers, by whom it was known as Taorert; and there is still a considerable Berber element in its population, though the Arabic language is in general use. The full Arab name is El Golea , a el Menia’a, or the “little fortress well defended.” According to the statement of the natives, the well in the upper town is about 60 feet deep.
