BALUZE, Etienne, a celebrated French scholar, was born at Tulle on the 24th of December 1630, and died in July 1718. After completing his education at the university of Toulouse, he was invited by Μ. de Marca, afterwards archbishop of Paris, to undertake the superintendence of his library. De Marca died in 1662, and Baluze, after acting as librarian to Le Tellier and the archbishop of Auch, obtained in 1667 a similar situation with the famous Colbert, which he retained? till 1700, some years after the death of that minister. His reputation and his mastery of French law and antiquities obtained for him in 1670 the professorship of canon law in the royal college, a chair founded expressly for him. On the fall of the Cardinal de Bouillon in 1710, Baluze, who had attached himself to his party, was removed by a lettre de cachet from Paris, and transferred from Rouen to Blois, Tours, and Orleans in succession. He obtained his recall in 1713, though he never recovered his professorship. Of Baluze’s numerous works the best known is the Capitularia Regum, Francorum, which is of considerable historical value. The Miscellanea, in 7 vols., contain several curious extracts from manuscripts found by him in the libraries at Paris.
