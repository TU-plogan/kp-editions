BOGOTA, or Santa Fé de Bogota, the capital of the United States of Colombia, in South America, is situated in the state of Cundinamarca, in 4° 6' N. lat. and 78° 30' W. long. It occupies a fine position at the base of the mountains La Guadalupe and Montserrato, on a table-land that forms part of the eastern ridge of the Andes, between the extensive valley of the Magdalena and the plains that are watered by part of the Orinoco system. The surrounding country is exceedingly fertile, and produces abundant crops of wheat and barley and the leguminous plants cultivated in Europe. The city of Bogota is the finest in the republic; its streets are well built, and run at right angles to each other; and within recent years most of them have been supplied with side pavements. The private houses are built of sun-dried bricks, and whitewashed; and owing to the prevalence of earthquakes they are mostly of one story in height. Of the streets the largest and finest is the Calle-Real or Calle de la Republica, which ends in a large square or plaza containing some of the chief buildings in the city. The cathedral, rebuilt in 1814, possesses very little external beauty; but its interior is fitted up with considerable elegance, its ornaments are rich and valuable, and the image of the Virgin, the patron saint, is covered with a profusion of precious stones. There are about thirty other churches in the city, but many of them are in a state of decay, while several of the monastic buildings are appropriated to secular uses,—the religious communities having been dissolved by Mosquera, and their revenues devoted in great measure to educational purposes. The convent of San Francisco is of great extent, and contains some of the productions of Vasquez, a native artist of merit. A large and elegant building—a capitol, for the reception of Congress and for the various offices of state—is now (1875) in course of erection. Besides the university there are three endowed colleges, a school of [9:3:859] chemistry and mineralogy, a national academy, a public library, a botanic garden, and a military school, which is supported out of the public funds, and has produced some good engineers. The mint, one of the three in the republic, is a large and handsome building, and is well supplied with the necessary machinery. There are manufactures of soap, cloth, leather, and the precious metals; an active trade is carried on; and the neighbourhood is rich in minerals of various kinds. The population in 1800 amounted to 21,464, exclusive of strangers and temporary residents; in 1821 it was estimated at 30,000, and in 1870 at about 52,000. Santa Fé de Bogota was founded in 1538 by Gonzalez Ximenes de Quesada, and received its name from his birthplace Santa Fé, with the addition of Bogota, in honour, it is said, of a native prince of that time. It soon increased in size and importance, and became the capital of the Spanish vice-royalty of New Granada. In 1811 the citizens threw off the Spanish yoke and a republic was proclaimed; the city, however, in 1816, fell into the hands of Murillo the Spanish general. Delivered by Bolivar in 1819 it was made capital of the republic of Colombia; on the separation of the three states it remained the chief city of New Granada, and it is now the capital of the United States of Colombia, forming itself an independent federal territory. It is the seat of the supreme court and the other offices of the Federal Government, and the residence of the foreign diplomatic representatives.
