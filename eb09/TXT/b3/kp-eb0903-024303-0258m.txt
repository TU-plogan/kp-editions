BAILLIE, Robert, a prominent Scotch Presbyterian of the 17th century, was bornât Glasgow in 1602. He graduated in 1620 at the university of that town, and then applied himself to the study of divinity. In 1631, after he had been ordained and had acted for some years as regent in the university, he was appointed to the living of Kilwinning in Ayrshire. The church disputes of the century were just beginning, and Baillie was naturally drawn into them. In 1638 he was a member of the famous Glasgow Assembly, and soon after he accompanied Leslie and the Scotch army as chaplain or preacher. In 1642 he was made professor of divinity at Glasgow, and in the following year was selected as one of the five Scotch [9:3:244] clergymen who were sent to the great Westminster Assembly. In 1649 he was one of the commissioners sent to Holland for the purpose of inviting Charles II. to Scotland, and of settling the terms of his admission to the government. He continued to take an active part in all the minor disputes of the church, and in 1661, after the ejection of Gillespie, he was made principal of the Glasgow University. He died in August of the following year,— his death being probably hastened by his mortification at the apparently firm establishment of Episcopacy in Scotland. Baillie was a man of learning and ability; his views were not extreme, and he played but a secondary part in the stirring events of the time. His Letters, by which he is now chiefly remembered, are of considerable historical importance, and give a very lively picture of the period. A complete memoir and a full notice of all his writings will be found in Dr Laing’s edition of the Letters and Journals of Robert Baillie, Bannatyne Club, 3 vols., Edinburgh, 1841-42.
