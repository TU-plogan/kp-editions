BAUHIN, Gaspard, the son of an eminent French physician, who had to leave his native country on becoming a convert to Protestantism, was born at Basel in 1560. Early devoting himself to medicine, he pursued his studies at Padua, Montpellier, and some of the celebrated schools in Germany. In his journeys through various parts of Europe he collected a number of plants which had escaped his elder brother's notice. Returning to Basel in 1580, he was admitted to the degree of doctor, and gave private lectures [9:3:447] in botany and anatomy. In 1582 he was appointed to the Greek professorship in that university, and in 1588 to the chair of anatomy and botany. He was afterwards made city physician, professor of the practice of medicine, rector of the university, and dean of his faculty. He published several works relative to botany, of which the most valuable is his Pinax Theatri Botanici, seu Index in Theophrasti, Dioscoridis, Plinii, et botanicorum qui a seculo scripserunt opera, 4to. The confusion that began to rise at this time from botanical writers describing the same plant under different names rendered such a task highly necessary; and though there are many defects in the execution, the Pinax of Bauhin is still a useful key to all the writers before his time. Another great work which he planned was a Theatrum Botanicum, meant to be comprised in twelve parts folio, of which he finished three; only one however was published. He also gave a very copious catalogue of the plants growing in the environs of Basel, and edited the works of Matthiolus with considerable additions. He likewise wrote on anatomy; his principal work on this subject is Theatrum Anatomicum infinitis locis auctum, 4to, Frankfort, 1621, which is a kind of pinax of anatomical facts and opinions. He died in 1624.
