BARAHAT, a town of northern Hindustan, situated in the Himâlayas, and within the native state of Garhwâl, in 30° 43' N. lat. and 78° 29' E. long. The town was almost destroyed in 1803 by an earthquake—a calamity greatly aggravated by the houses having been built of large stones, with slated roofs. From its central position, it maintains a free communication with all parts of the hills, and those who make the pilgrimage to Gangotri generally halt here and lay in a stock of provisions for the journey. In the neighbourhood stands a curious trident in honour of Siva. The pedestal is of copper, the shaft of brass about 12 feet, and the forks about 6 feet in length. There is no tradition to show the origin of this curious relic; and although it bears a legible inscription, no one has as yet deciphered it. The temple in which it was formerly enclosed was destroyed by the earthquake of 1803.
