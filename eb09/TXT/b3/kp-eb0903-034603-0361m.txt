BANNERETS. In the early ages of chivalry there w r ere two kinds of knights, called respectively Bachelors and Bannerets. The former carried pennons terminating in a point or points; the latter, banners,—that is to say, pennons rendered square by having the points cut off. This process of converting the pennon into the banner was done by the sovereign himself on the field of battle, standing beneath his own royal standard displayed. The distinction, awarded for peculiar gallantry, was a very high one: and those who [9:3:347] enjoyed it ranked above all other knights except those of the Garter. The banner bore the coat armour of the banneret himself, and served as an ensign for the followers and retainers whom he took with him into the camp or court. The king himself and the greatest nobles were members of the order; and we have in the Roll of Caerlaverock the blazon of nearly one hundred bannerets (including the king, eleven earls, and the bishop of Durham) who were present with Edward I. in his campaign against Scotland in 1300. The etymology of the word is clear; and Selden, after expressing his opinion that baro is equivalent to vir, remarks that “the Germans have also the name of banner-heer or panner-heer, as if you would say dominus vexillifer, or the like, or as the title of banneret” (Titles of Honour, part ii. 1, 52). Nevertheless the term banneret, either from simple misapprehension or in order to mark the relative rank of the knight, has been translated baronettus (quasi baro minor) in some old statutes; and the historian Walsingham, in describing the prisoners at the battle of Stirling, speaks of Barones et Baronetti viginti duo, Ac. Indeed, in a patent granted to Sir Ralph Vane so late as 4 Edward VI., his grade of banneret is Latinized by Baronettus. In France, it is said, the dignity was hereditary; but in England it died with the person who gained it. On the institution of baronets by King James I., the order dwindled, and at length became extinct. The last banneret created was Sir John Smith, who received the dignity after the battle of Edgehill, for his gallantry in rescuing the standard of Charles I.
