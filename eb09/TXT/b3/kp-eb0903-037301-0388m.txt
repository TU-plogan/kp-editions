BARERE DE VIEUZAC, Bertrand, one of the most notorious members of the French National Convention, was born at Tarbes in Gascony, September 10, 1755. He was brought up to the profession of the law, and was admitted advocate to the parliament of Toulouse. He wrote several trivial pieces, panegyrics of Louis XVI., Montesquieu, J. J. Rousseau, and others, which obtained prizes from provincial academies, and a dissertation on a Latin inscription which procured him membership of the Academy of Floral Games of Toulouse. Such was the smooth beginning of a career which ultimately became unparalleled for meanness, cowardice, lying, and atrocious cruelty. At the age of thirty he married. Four years later, in 1789, he was elected deputy by his own province to the States-general, which met in May. He had made his first visit to Paris in the preceding year. His personal appearance, his manners, social qualities, and liberal opinions, gave him a good standing among the multitude of provincial wise-heads then thronging into Paris, eager to be the saviours of France, or at least of themselves. He took his place at first with the monarchical party; and his·, glib pen found occupation in the preparation of various reports, and in editing a journal, the Point du Jour, containing reports of the debates of the National Assembly. For a time he formed a connection with the House of Orleans, passing over soon to the republican party. Barère appears to have been wholly free from the restraints of conscience or any guiding principle; his conduct was regulated only by the determination to be on the side of the strongest. After the close of the National Assembly he was nominated one of the judges of the newly-instituted Court of Cassation. In 1792 he was elected deputy to the National Convention for the department of the Hautes Pyrénées. At first he took part with the Girondists; but on the trial of the king he voted, with the Mountain, for the king’s death “sans appel et sans sursis.” He closed his speech with a sentence which became memorable, “L’arbre de la liberté ne saurait croître s’il n’était arrosé du sang du rois.” As the Mountain became the strongest party Barère advanced with it, unscrupulously carrying out its extremest projects, and playing a prominent part in the Reign of Terror. The light-heartedness with which he acted in these awful scenes, the fluency and flippancy of his speeches and reports, procured him the title of the “Anacreon of the Guillotine.” He supported Robespierre in his atrocious measure against the Girondists, crawled like a slave at the feet of the “incorruptible” Maximilian till the day of his fall, and then advocated his execution without a hearing. It was Barère who had proposed the decree that no quarter should be given to any English or Hanoverian soldier, which was unanimously adopted. This procured him admission by acclamation to the Jacobin Club, from which he had been previously excluded. The decree, however, remained a dead letter. A few months after the fall of the Convention, proceedings were taken against Barère and his colleagues of the Terror, Collot d’Herbois and Billaud-Varennes, and he was sent to the Isle of Oléron. He was removed to Saintes, and thence escaped to Bordeaux, where he lay in concealment for several years. In 1795 he was elected member of the Council of Fire Hundred, but was not allowed to take his seat. When Napoleon Bonaparte was First Consul he was anxious to employ Barère, but Barère refused the overture. It was only for a while. The witling of the Terror became the hireling and the spy of the new tyranny. On the fall of Napoleon, Barère played the part of royalist, but on the final restoration of the Bourbons in 1815 he was banished for life from France, and then withdrew into Belgium and temporary oblivion. After the Revolution of July 1830 he reappeared in France, was reduced by a series of lawsuits to extreme indigence, accepted a small pension assigned him by Louis Philippe (on whom he had heaped [9:3:374] abuse and railing), and died, the last survivor of the Committee of Public Safety, January 15, lt>41. Two years after his death appeared Mémoires de Bertrand Barere, edited by Hippolyte Carnot and David of Angers. (See Macaulay’s article in the Edinburgh Review, vol. lxxix., in which the character and career of Barère^[1. Summed up thus :—“Our opinion then is this, that Barère approached nearer than any person mentioned in history or fiction, whether man or devil, to the idea of consummate and universal depravity. In him the qualities which are the proper objects of hatred, and the qualities which are the proper objects of contempt, preserve an exquisite and absolute harmony. In almost every particular sort of wickedness he has had rivals. His sensuality was immoderate; but this was a failing common to him with many great and amiable men. There have been many men as cowardly as he, some as cruel, a few as mean, a few as impudent. There may also have been as great liars, though we never met with them or read of them. But when we put every· thing together, sensuality, poltroonery, baseness, effrontery, mendacity, barbarity, the result is something which in a novel we should condemn as caricature, and to which, we venture to say, no parallel can be found in history” ] are discussed with characteristic emphasis and severity.)
