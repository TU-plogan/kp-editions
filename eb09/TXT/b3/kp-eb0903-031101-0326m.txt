BANDON, or Bandonbridge, an inland town and parliamentary borough of Ireland, in the county of Cork, and twenty miles by rail from the county town, is situated on both sides of the River Bandon, which is here crossed by a bridge of six arches. It has two churches, a handsome Roman Catholic chapel, Protestant and Methodist places of worship, a convent, two market-houses, a spacious quay on the south side of the river, an infirmary, a hospital, a dispensary, several public libraries and reading-rooms, an endowed school, a court-house, a bridewell, and barracks. Its manufactures of woollen and cotton goods have much declined; but there are distilleries, breweries, tanneries, and flour-mills. Population in 1871, 6131.
