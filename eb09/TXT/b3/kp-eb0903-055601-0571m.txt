BENAVENTE, a decayed town of Spain, in the province of Zamora, situated on a gentle eminence near the River Esla. It formerly gave title to the Pimentais, a powerful family of counts, which is now merged in that of the dukes of Osuna. The ancient castle still exists in a ruinous condition. Among the numerous churches, for which the town was once remarkable, are Santa Maria del Azogue, dating from the 12th and 13th centuries, and San Juan del Mercado, which once belonged to the Knights-Templars, and still contains some very old sepulchral monuments. Silk-spinning is carried on by the inhabitants, who number 4536.
