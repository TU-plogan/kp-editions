BLICHER, Steen Steensen, Danish lyrical poet and novelist, was born at Vium in Viborg, Jutland, on the 11th October 1782. He was extremely delicate in constitution, and after having passed a year or two at the university, which he joined in 1799, was compelled to give up his studies on account of a consumptive complaint. He accepted a situation as tutor in a family at Falster, and by vigorous physical exercise and flute-playing succeeded in restoring himself to health. He afterwards returned to the university, and completed his course in 1809. Several years were then spent at his father’s parsonage, preparing for the ministry and managing the farm. In 1819 he was called to the church of Thorning, and in 1825 to a more remunerative charge at Spentπιp. Here he died in 1848. Bücher was first known by his translations of Ossian, but his early poems did not attract much attention. He then contributed to a literary journal, the Nordlyset, in which appeared the first of his Jutland tales {Jydske Romanzer). The popularity of these romances was surpassed by that of the National Noveller, which give an admirable picture of country life in Jutland. His collected poems, some of which had appeared as early as 1814, were published in 2 vols., 1835-36; the novels appeared in 5 vols., 1833-36. A short sketch of his own life and character was prefixed by him to the complete collection,—Old and New Novels {Garnie og nye Noveller) 7 vols., 1846-47. Bücher also translated Goldsmith’s Vicar of Wakefield.
