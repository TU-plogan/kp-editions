+=====================================================================+


BARRY, Sir Charles, a distinguished English architect, was born at Westminster, May 23, 1795. After pursuing his elementary professional studies for six years as apprentice to a firm of architects at Lambeth, he set out, in 1817, on the customary foreign tour, visiting Greece and Italy, Egypt and Palestine, and enriching his memory and imagination by the study of the great buildings and τemai∏3 of former ages. On his return to England in 1820 he settled in London, and was not slow in attaining distinction. One of the first works by which his abilities as an architect-became generally known was the church of St Peter at Brighton.—an attempt in Perpendicular Gothic completedin 1826. He built many other churches; but the marked preference for Italian architecture, which he acquired during his travels, showed itself in various important undertakings of his earlier years. In 1831 he erected the Travellers’ Club in Pall Mall, a splendid work in the Italian style, and the first of its kind built in London. In the same style and on a grander scale, he erected, some years later, the Reform Club. It is unnecessary to particularize the numerous private mansions on which he was engaged, one of the latest and most magnificent of which was Bridgewater House, the town residence of the earl of Ellesmere. Birmingham possesses one of his best works in the buildings of King Edward’s grammar school, in the Tudor style. For Manchester he designed the Athenaeum, in the Italian style; and for Halifax, the town-hall. He was engaged for some years in reconstructing the Treasury buildings, Whitehall. But his masterpiece, and perhaps, notwithstanding all unfavourable criticism, the masterpiece of English architecture of the 19th century, is the new palace at Westminster. 1 After the destruction of the old houses of parliament by fire in October 1834, Barry was the successful competitor for erecting the new palace. The first stone was laid in the spring of 1840; the work was steadily carried on in the face of many difficulties,'and through a maze of private dissensions and public complaints, and it was at length completed in 1860. Twenty years seemed long in passing, but once past the time assuredly will no more seem too long to have been employed in the erection, or, we might say, allowed for the growth of this stately and beautiful pile, one of the truest glories of the banks of the Thames. Barry was elected A.R.A. in 1840, and R.A. in the following year. His genius and achievements were recognized by the representative artistic bodies of the principal European nations; and his name was enrolled as a member of the academies of art at Rome, Berlin, St Petersburg, Brussels, and Stockholm. He was chosen F.R.S. in 1849, and was knighted by the Queen in 1852. He died suddenly at Clapham, near London, May 12, 1860, and his remains were interred in Westminster Abbey. In 1867 appeared a life of Sir Charles Barry by his son, Dr Alfred Barry, principal of King’s College, London. A claim was thereupon set up on behalf of Mr A. Welby Pugin deceased, -who had been Barry’s assistant, to a much larger share in the work of designing the Westminster Palace than was admitted in Dr Barry’s narrative. The controversy raged for a time, but without substantiating Mr Pugin’s claim.
