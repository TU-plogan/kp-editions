BATTEUX, Charles, a French writer on philosophy and the principles of literature, was born near Vouziers in 1713, and died in 1780. In 1739 he came to Paris, and after having taught with success in the colleges of Lisieux and Navarre, was appointed to the chair of Greek and Roman philosophy in the College of France. In 1746 he published his treatise Beaux Arts réduits à une même Principe, in which he extended the Aristotelian definition of the art of poetry to art of all kinds. His Cours de Belles-Lettres, 5 vols., 1765, was afterwards included with some minor writings in the large treatise Principes de la Littérature, 1774. The rules for composition there laid down are, perhaps, too methodical and pedantic. His philosophical writings were La Morale d'Epicure tirée de sesp>ropres écrits, 1758, and the Histoire de Causes Premières^ 1769, a survey of the history of philosophy which is by no means devoid of merit. In consequence of the freedom with which he attacked in this work the abuse of authority in matters of philosophy, he was removed from his professorial chair. His last and most extensive work was a Cours d’études à Γusage des élèves de l'école militaire, 45 vols.
