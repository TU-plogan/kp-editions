BERGAMO, a northern province of Italy, bounded on the N. by Sondrio, E. by Tyrol and Brescia, S. by Cremona, and W. by Milan and Como. The northern portion is mountainous and well wooded, while the southern belongs to the alluvial plain of Lombardy. To the N. and W. of Lake Iseo there are numerous mineral wells, the most important of which are those of Trescoro. Marble is abundant in the mountains, and there are valuable iron mines. At an early period the wealth of the capital appears to have been increased by the working of copper mines in the district. (See Finazzi, Sidle antiche miniere di Bergamo, Milan, 1860.) The vine and flax are largely grown, and the culture of the silk-worm is extensively carried on. The people speak a rough dialect, and are liable to be laughed at by the other Italians. The two stock characters of popular Italian comedy, Harlequin or Truffaldino and the sly Brighella, were both at one time represented as natives of the Bergamo district.

Bergamo, the capital of the above province, is situated between the Brembo and Serio, two tributaries of the Adda, 39 miles N.E. of Milan, on the railway that runs from Venice to the Lake of Como. It consists of a new and an old town, the latter known as the Città, or city, being built on a hill, while the former, or Borgo S. Leonardo, occupies the level ground below. On the eastern side there are also two important suburbs, £. Caterina and Palazzo. Bergamo is the seat of a bishop and a prefect, and possesses a school of art known as the Accademia Carrara, a museum, a lyceum, a library contained in the Palazzo Vecchio or Broletto, a musical institute, two theatres, and various scientific societies. There are also a lunatic asylum, a hospital, and other charitable institutions. Among its numerous churches may be mentioned S. Maria Maggiore, which dates from 1173, and the neighbouring Colleoni chapel, the old Arian church of San Alessandro della Croce, S. Bartolommeo, and S. Grata. The principal objects of industry in the city are silk, cotton, and woollen goods, iron-wares, waxcloth and wax candles, and playing cards. A large fair, called the Fiera di S. Alessandro, is annually held in the new town. It dates from the 10th century, and is of great importance, especially for the silk trade. Bergamo, or Bergomum, was a municipal town during the Roman empire, and, after being destroyed by Attila, became one of the most flourishing cities of the Lombard kings, who made it the capital of a duchy. In the 15 th century it was appropriated and fortified by the Venetians. In 1509 it was occupied by Louis XII. of France, who retained it for seven years, and then restored it to Venice. In 1796 the French again made themselves masters of the city, and constituted it the capital of their department of Serio. Bergamo was the birthplace of Tiraboschi, Rubini, and Donizetti. Population, 37,363.
