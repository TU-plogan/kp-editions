BISCAY, Bay of, in French the Golfe de Gascogne, and the Roman Sinus Aquitanicus, an extensive gulf or bay of the Atlantic, enclosed by the northern coast of Spain and the western coast of France. It extends from the island of Ushant, on the coast of Finistère, to Cape Ortegal on the north of Galicia. In the Spanish portion of the bay the water is about 200 fathoms deep, while in the French portion it is only 20 fathoms. Navigation is impeded by strong westerly winds, and by Rennel’s Current, which sets in from the west and sweeps along the southern and eastern shores sometimes at a rate of 27 miles a day. The Loire, Charente, Gironde, and Λdour, besides numerous smaller streams from the Spanish mountains, fall into the bay.
