BARNES, Aebert, a theologian of America, specially distinguished as a Biblical expositor, was born at Rome in the state of New York, 1st December 1798, and died at Philadelphia 24th December 1870. In 1820 he graduated at Hamilton College, and in the same year commenced his studies for the ministry at Princeton Theological Seminary. Soon after taking licence he was called to the Presbyterian church in Morristown, New Jersey, from which he was transferred to the pastoral charge of the first Presbyterian church of Philadelphia in 1830. In 1867 he was compelled to resign owing to failing health. Barnes held a prominent place in the New School branch of the Presbyterians, to which he had adhered on the division of the denomination. He was an eloquent preacher, but his wide-spread reputation rests chiefly on his expository works, which have probably had a larger circulation both in Europe and America than any others of their class. Of the well-known Notes on the New Testament it is said that more than a million volumes had been issued at the time of their authorâ€™s death. The Notes on Job, the Psalms, Isaiah, and Daniel, found scarcely less acceptance. Displaying little original critical power, their chief merit lies in the fact that they bring the results of the criticism of others within the reach of general readers. Barnes was the author of several other works of a practical and devotional kind.
