BALFOUR, Sir James, of Pittendreich, at one time lord president of the Supreme Court in Scotland, an active and unscrupulous politician during the stormy period of the reign of Mary. He was originally educated for the church, and adopted the principles of the Reformers. With Knox and others he was condemned to the galleys on account of the part he had taken in the murder of Beaton, but after their release he abjured Protestantism, and speedily acquired great favour with the court, obtaining some considerable legal dignities. He was deeply implicated in the murder of Darnley, and drew up the bond which was signed by all the conspirators. As some reward for his services, he was made, by Mary, governor of Edinburgh Castle, a position in which he had a good opportunity for the exercise of his great talents for treachery. He yielded the castle to Murray on conditions favourable to himself alone, and then threw in his lot with the regent’s party, by whose favour he secured the post of lord president. During the next few years he changed his political views more than once, but managed to keep in safety, though for a time he deemed it prudent to withdraw to France. On the accession of James he returned; and, after having had once to flee from Morton, now his deadly enemy, he brought about the destruction of that nobleman by producing the bond bearing upon Darnley’s murder. He died not long after in 1583. The collection of statutes entitled the Practicks is generally ascribed to him; but it is not known how much of the book belongs to him and how much to Sir John Skene, his colleague in the task of arranging them.
