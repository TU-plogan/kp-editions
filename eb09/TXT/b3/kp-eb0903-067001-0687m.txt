Until the latter part of the 18th century Bijnaur belonged to the brave Rohilla Afghans, whose subjugation forms so deep a blot on the career of Warren Hastings. In 1774 the mercenary arms of Britain subjected this people to the oppressive rule of the Nawâb of Oudh, who in turn ceded the district to the East India Company in 1802.
