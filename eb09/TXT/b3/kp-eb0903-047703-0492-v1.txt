BECCLES, a market-town and municipal borough, in the county of Suffolk, on the right bank of the River Waveney, 32 miles N.N.E. of Ipswich. It consists of several streets, is well built, and contains a fine old parish church, enlarged and repaired in 1859, several dissenting chapels, a free school, founded in the reign of James I., a free grammar school, a handsome town-hall, a customhouse, and a corn exchange. Malting is carried on to some extent; and by means of the river, which is navigable from Yarmouth, a considerable trade in coals and produce is carried on. The incorporation of the town dates from 1584. Population in 1871, 4844.
