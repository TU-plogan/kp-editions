BERNARDIN, St, of Siena, a celebrated preacher, was born at Massa Carrara in 1380. His family, the Albizeschi, was noble, and his father was chief magistrate of Massa. He lost both parents before his eighth year, and was educated by his aunt, a pious woman. After completing his course of study he passed some years as a voluntary assistant in the hospital of Scala, and in 1404 entered the order of St Francis. His eloquence as a preacher made him celebrated throughout Italy, nor was his fame diminished by his visit to the Holy Land, from which he returned with fresh zeal. Three cities, Siena, Ferrara, and Urbino, successively sought the honour of having him as their bishop, but without avail. In 1438 he was made vicar-general of his order in Italy. He died on the 20th May 1444, at Aquila in Abruzzo. His canonization took place in 1450 by the order of Nicholas V. A collection of his works was published in 1571 by Rudolfi, bishop of Sinigaglia.
