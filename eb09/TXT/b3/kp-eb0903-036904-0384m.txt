BARCLAY, Robert, one of the most eminent writers belonging to the Society of Friends, or Quakers, w as born in 1648 at Gordonstown in Morayshire. He was sent to finish his education in Paris, and it appears he was at one time inclined to accept the Roman Catholic faith. In 1667, however, he followed the example of his father, Colonel Barclay of Urie, and joined the recently formed Society of Friends. He was an ardent theological student, a man of w arm feelings and considerable mental power, and he soon came prominently forward as the leading apologist of the new doctrine. Hie greatest work, An Apology for the True Christian Divinity, was published in Latin in 1676, and was an elaborate statement of the grounds for holding certain fundamental positions, laid down in the Theses Theologicae which had been put forward in the preceding year. The most prominent of the Theses was that bearing on Immediate Revelation, in which the superiority of this Inner Light to Reason or Scripture is sharply stated. Barclay experienced to some extent the persecutions inflicted on the new society, and was several times thrown Into prison. He died in 1690 at the early age of forty-two. His Apology, which is still the most important manifesto of the Quaker society, was translated by himself into English in 1678. Translations of it into foreign languages have also appeared.
