BIRDS

ANATOMY OF BIRDS.

IN the consideration of the Anatomy of Birds, classification will be quite a secondary matter, and merely employed for the elucidation of internal structure. Some sort of grouping, however, is indispensable; and that is accordingly adopted, as the most convenient for the morphologist, which was first proposed by Professor Huxley,^[1. “On the Classification of Birds; and of the taxonomic value of the modifications of certain of the cranial bones observable in that class,” Proceedings of the Zoological Society, April 11, 1867, pp. 415-472. This classification is somewhat modified in a later paper by the same author, in which a very masterly description is given of the Gallinaceous group (Alectoromorphae, Huxley), “On the Classification and Distribution of the Alectoromorphae and Heteromorphoe,” ibid., May 14, 1868, pp. 293-319. The same author repeats, in essentially the same form, tho original classification in his Anatomy of the Vertebrated Animals (1871, p. 272). The materials from which the modified views here given have been taken are in a series of contributions by Mr Parker to the Transactions of the Linnean and Zoological Societies now (1875) passing through the press. For figures of the skeleton see Mr Eyton’s Oi>tcologιa Avium.] with the introduction of certain modifications rendered necessary by the present writer’s own researches—researches, it may be added, which have been carried on in constant communication with that investigator.

A little examination will show that the groups made by consideration of any, even the most important, morphological modifications, cannot be superimposed upon groups made by reference to the whole sum of the characters of the Bird. This may be easily explained. About half the known Birds, 5000 or thereabouts, belong, according to G. R. Gray, to Professor Huxley’s group, the Coraco- morphoe. These birds undergo a peculiar metamorphosis of the naso-palatal structures, and are called by Professor Huxley the Aegithognathae on that account. Now all the Coracomorphae have the aegithognathous palate, but so also have the Cypselidae, or Swifts, which are placed by this author with the Humming-birds and Goatsuckers, both of which groups are simply schizognathous. Moreover, below the Passerine types, and only next above the Semi-struthious Tinamous, we find the Hemipods, Turnicidoe, or Tumicimorphoe, and these have an aegithognathous palate. So also has another type, Thinocorus, which lies on the same low zoological level as the Hemipods. This latter bird is essentially a small Geranomorph, but it is below the true Cranes, and unites in its palate characters belonging to the Ostriches below it and the Passerines which ascend, zoologically, far above it.

The difficulty of applying this very valuable morphological grouping, and making it fit in with one that is more general and distinctively zoological (that is, having reference to every character, external, and internal), does not take away anything of real value from it. To the anatomist such a mode of viewing the various types is perfectly natural, however hard it may be to satisfy the pure zoologist as to its great value. Certainly, the structures of the skull and face govern the whole body, as it were; every other part of the organism corresponds to what is observable there. Nor must it be forgotten that the true mode of studying any kind of creature is that of its development; and the head undergoes the most remarkable morphological changes.

In the following scheme we have added one new morphological group to Professor Huxley’s classification. This group includes the Woodpeckers and Wrynecks, Picidoe and Yungidoe. Zoologically it forms the family Celeo- morphoe (Huxley); its morphological term is Saurognathoe (Parker).

Every one who has laboured at the anatomy of this class must have been struck by its marvellous uniformity; almost countless numbers of species are found passing insensibly into one another, and differing in the slightest manner. The best modern zoologists are at times almost at their wits’ end to know by what characters they may distinguish their genera and species. This has been well put by Professor Huxley (Anat. of Vert. Anim.) He says (p. 272)—“Though this class contains a great number of specific forms, the structural modifications which they present are of comparatively little importance; any two birds which can be selected differing from one another far less than the extreme types of the Lacertilia, and hardly more than the extreme forms of the Chelonia, do. Hence the characters by which the following groups” (see subjoined table) “are separated appear almost insignificant when compared with those by which the divisions of the Reptilia are indicated.”

The above scheme is a nail in a sure place; and on it, for the present, we may hang all that we know, or are learning, of the anatomical structure of this class of Vertebrates. That which relates to the Carinatoe must, however, be regarded merely as a list of Birds having a similar facial structure.

For the general ornithologist it is very suggestive and helpful, and will save him from looking merely on outward appearances; for the study of structure and development is looking into the heart of the matter.

The Skull.

To both the zoologist and the palaeontologist an explanation of the skeleton will be of the greatest value, for the framework must of necessity be correlated to the nervous system, and also govern the development of the muscles. It will here form the first and the largest part of our work. And as all things in the skeleton are conformed to the modifications of the skull, and, moreover, as the skull is the most knotty problem to the morphologist, it will receive the attention due to its superior importance.

Instead of describing the adult skull, and then showing how it develops, it would seem to be better to follow the stages of its growth, and thus see the meaning of the parts, and what metamorphic changes take place to give it its adult characters. Space will not permit any detail of the general embryology of the Bird, but the skull will be described from the time when the rudiments of the chondro-cranium are first fairly visible, that is, about the fifth day of incubation.^[5. The whole development of the Chick is explained in a masterly and lucid manner by Messrs Foster and Balfour in their excellent work, The Elements of Embryology, London: Macmillan and Co. Part I., 1874. The description of the fowl’s skull here given is principally from Mr Parker’s paper, Phil. Trans., 1869, plates 81-87, pp. 755-807. For a detailed description of the anatomy of birds, see Dr H. G. Bronn’s Klassen und Ordnungen des Thierreichs, 1869, 6te Band, IV. Abtheilung, “Vögel.’’]

As the Schizognathous type of skull, such as is seen in the Fowl, is the simplest variety found in the Carinatae, it will be the most convenient for comparison with that of the Ratitoe and the Tinamous (the Dromceognathous variety) below, and the Desmognathous, and other kinds seen in Birds above the Gallinaceae in the zoological scale.

The Cranium of the Fowl—First Stage.— The chondrocranium may be seen at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the fifth day of incubation, although the cartilage has as yet but little consistence, its cells being imperfectly soldered together. The head of the skull at this stage still shows the “visceral clefts;” and it is bent upon itself by what is called the mesocephalic flexure. When the membranous roof of the skull and the brain are removed at this stage, the whole floor is not seen from above, the fore-part being bent under and looking backwards.

[n the hinder half of the skullfloor, behind the eyeballs, we see a broad plate of tissue (fig. 1, comp. fig. 4, i.v.) which is passing rapidly from the condition of stellate cells into proper hyaline cartilage.

This plate is divided at the midline by a straight, somewhat beaded rod of soft indifferent tissue, which does not chondrify; it is rounded at its fore - end. This truly azygous part is the notochord (n.c.), QT primary axis of the skeletal parts of the embryo; it lies directly beneath the neural axis, and is one of the parts earliest visible to the embryologist. The broad plate on each side is seen to be hollow, and to contain a pear-shaped diverticulum of the primordial ear-sac (cl.), which is planted, as it were, in the veιy substance of the basal plate, at its middle. The outer granular covering of the ear-sac becomes cartilage, and so does the basal plate—the “investing mass” of Rathke, the “parachordal cartilage” of Huxley.^[6. See Huxley on “Menobranchus,” Proceedings of Zoological Society, March 17, 1874, p. 197.]

But the process by which these two separate morphological territories become converted into solid cheese-like cartilage is carried on blindly, as it were, and no distinction of parts is at present traceable; evident differentiation of morphological territories is often late in the higher types of vertebrata. The tissue which surrounds the spinal chord where this part passes into the brain is still soft; it -will chondrify soon to form the occipital arch. The bulbous end of the notochord ends a little behind an oval membranous space or fontanelle in the skull-floor—the pituitary space (pt.s.). Near the end of the notochord, on each side, the cartilage suddenly narrows, for here we are in front of the impacted ear-sacs; at this part a bending of the narrow anterior end of the parachordal rounded notch (5) is formed, over which the trigeminal nerve passes. The anterior margin of the notch (afterwards formed into the foramen ovale) is formed by the cartilage; its actual extremity looks forward and outward, towards the eyeball. At present the bands which are continued forward, surrounding the pituitary space, are superimposed upon, and indistinct from, the ends of the parachordal cartilages; in the next stage they will be seen more distinctly. These flat bands of dense granular tissue are the trabecula cranii of Rathke (tr.), and they were supposed by him to be mere continuations of the parachordal bands, an error corrected some years ago by Professor Huxley. These little rafters of the cranium bend gently round the oval pituitary space; they then completely[9:3:701] unite into a broad inter-nasal plate, which is bent over upon itself so as to appear on the under surface of the face.

The inter-nasal plate is arched and winged—the rudi mentary condition of the nasal sacs, the apertures of which are seen beneath the arched part below (fig. 2, n.)

The trabeculae, antero-inferiorly, become free again; these free extremities are the ventral ends of this the first visceral arch; they form the pith of the flat, emarginate rudimentary neb. This part is called the “fronto-nasal process” (fig. 2, ∕.n.)

On the sides of the face behind the mouth are seen slits (fig. 2, 1, 2, 3); these are the “visceral clefts,” which are always developed in embryonic vertebrata. Between these clefts the tissue of the “mesoblast” is thickening into cartilaginous rods; these rods are the post-oral visceral arches, the rudiments of the lower jaw and hyoid bone. But beneath the eye is seen an arcuate bar of tissue more solid than its surroundings; this is the pterygopalatine rod. It is developed in the maxillo-palatine process of the mandibular or first post-oral arch; it represents the bar of cartilage which, in the Frog, connects the mandibular suspensorium with the ethmoidal region.^[7. See article Amphibia, vol. i. p. 755, fig. 9, between pd. and A.O.]

The first visceral arch, then, runs along in front of the parachordal cartilages; the trabeculae cranii are its right and left moieties. The second arch can only be understood by reference to the development of the lower types of Vertebrata; for in the Shark, Skate, Newt, and Frog the pterygo-palatine portion is not a distinct cartilage, but runs forward as a process of the suspensory part of the lower jaw. But this early division of a visceral arch into an antero-superior and a postero-inferior bar is very constant in the next or second visceral arch from the Skate up to Man. Let it be remembered that the cartilaginous stage is the second; in the first stage the skeletal parts are membranous. They are formed of soft stellate cells in the mesoblast.^[8. See Foster and Balfour’s work, p. 223.]

At present the subocular pterygo-palatine bar is very little denser than the tissue in which it is imbedded, but the mandible itself is fast passing into cartilage. Already it is in two pieces, a suspensory piece (figs. 1 and 2, q.), and a free rod (mk.); the upper piece becomes the quadrate, and the lower, longer part the articulo-Meckelian bar. The processes of the tuberous upper piece are indistinct, but it is sinuous below where it articulates with the thick end of the free bar. These bars nearly, but not quite, meet in the rudimentary chin, the ventral end of the lower jaw. Properly speaking, the hyoid arch is composed of two visceral arches; but the term is now applied strictly to the first of these, namely, the second visceral, or the arch of the tongue. At present this arch has, with the one in front of it, its antero-superior piece quite soft; it, too, is late in its development. The two lower pieces (fig. 2, c.h.) form the skeleton of the tongue. They are the ceratohyals, and between these is a smallbasi-hyal (b.ħ, y ) answering to the first basi-branchial of a Fish. The third post-oral arch is very similar, but it is larger, and its upper piece is already fast chondrifying. That corresponds to the first epi-branchial of a Fish, the lower piece to the first ceratobranchial, and the median w edge to the second basibranchial.^[9. See Parker “On the Salmon’s Skull,” Phil. Trans., 1873, plate 6, fig. 3. See also plate 2 of the same paper for the subdivision, in a Teleostean Fish, of the hyoid arch.] Cranium of Fowl—Second Stage. —In from twenty-four to thirty hours, or about the beginning of the sixth day of incubation, the chondro-cranium of the chick has undergone sundry and notable changes. A sectional view (fig. 3)

shows that the hinder and front cartilages, parachordal and trabecular, are applied to each other unconformably, the parachordal tracts rising high between the second and third cerebral vesicles, and forming the posterior pituitary wall, a shelving structure in which the axial skeleton ends.

A bird’s-eye view of the hinder skull-floor at this stage (fig. 4) shows that the dorsal or hinder ends of the trabeculae have opened out, like a pair of callipers, and that the out-turned ends of the parachordal cartilages are fused with the inner margin of these apices. The bud-shaped process, which has almost freed itself from the rest, opposite the bulbous end of the notochord, is the true apex of the first visceral bar, or trabecula; in the next stage it is far more distinct and instructive. Turning again to the vertical section (fig. 3), we see that the commissure of the trabeculae, or inter-nasal plate,^[10. This corresponds to the flattened, narrow mesethτnoid of Menobranchus. See Amphibia, vol. i. pp. 756 757 figs. 11, 12.] has now become a high wall of cartilage, separating not only the nasal sacs, but also the eyeballs.

That part of the septum which now looks, not only downwards, but is also turned somewhat backward (fig. 3, eth.), will ultimately lie in the upper part of the nasal and frontal regions. A new thing has appeared, namely, an [9:3:702] azygous cartilaginous bud at the mid-line of the frontonasal process; it is about to become the axis of the beak, and will turn forwards and upwards. This is the prenasal or basi-trabecular cartilage, a notable morphological element up here, amongst the Birds, and down amongst the lower or cartilaginous types of Fishes. At the present it corresponds exactly to the state of the Green Turtle’s skull (chondrocranium) at the time of hatching, and in that type it stops at this stage, not raising itself into a forth-standing rostrum.

The mouth, which in the first stage was a large four-sided cleft, with produced corners, and clean beneath the head, as in a Skate, is now a space, the axis of which points more forward than downward, a good step towards its eventual direction. The further development of the facial arches will be best studied in older specimens at the end of this, the second stage; but at its commencement there is wanted the condition of the anterosuperior segment of the hyoid, or second post-oral arch. This has not been worked out in the Fowl’s chick, but in an embryo of the House Martin (Chelidon urbica), corresponding to the stage given in our third figure as to development.

In this instance the quadrate and articular Meckelian cartilages have acquired very nearly their proper form (fig. 5, g., ar., mk.), the suspensorial part having a free forward and inward looking process, the “pedicle,” and a backward turned process, the “otic process,” articulating with the auditory sac (this is drawn as cut away in part, and only that which is conjoined to the occipital cartilage (t.e.o.) is given). Just below and behind the otic process of the quadrate, exactly where in riper embryos we find the fenestra ovalis, having fitted into it the elegant oval base of the “columella auris,” there is in this instance a curious trowel of cartilage, continuous by the upturned end of its handle with the very substance of the ear-capsule. The solid sickle-shaped cartilage behind this is the “tympanic wing” of the exoccipital ∖ t.e.o.) Here we have the wanting upper and anterior segment of the hyoid arch, corresponding to the separately developed pterygo-palatine bar, its “serial homologue.” The blade or free end of the trowel is concave on the under side, and is thick above and at its margin on the outside; it is pointed above and below. A ligament connects the upper point with the ear-capsule behind the quadrate, and another tract of soft indifferent tissue reaches downwards to a small bar of cartilage, which looks backwards and a little downwards. This little cartilage (st.h.) is only connected with the distal piece (c.hy.) by fibrous tissue; it is the stylohyal, and corresponds to what is permanent in the Crocodile. The bar itself is the “medio-stapedial” (m.st.) ; it will soon segment itself off from the ear-capsule, bringing away with it an oval piece of the periotic wall; that oval part is the true stapes. The broad part of the “blade” is the extra-stapedial, and on it will be stretched the membrani tympani. It precisely corresponds now with that of that old Lacertian Hatteria or Sphenodon. ^[11. See Huxley “On the Representatives of the Malleus and Incus of the Mammalia in the other Vertebrata,” Proc. Zool. Soc., May 27, 1869, pp. 394-397, figs. 1-4.] λ

The “stylo-hyal” will soon be conjoined to the extra-stapedial plate, and the (afterwards) chondrified band will be the “infra-stapedial.”^[12. For a comparison of these parts with the ossicula auditus of the Mammal, see also Parker “On the Structure and Development of the Skull in the Pig,” Phil. Trans. 1874 *>. 331.]

In a few hours the changes that have taken place in the chick’s skull are very noticeable and important; these are recorded as the end of the second stage.

A side view of the chondro-cranium ''fig. 6), the membrano-cranium above the brain being removed, shows how fast the life-processes are moulding the embryonic head into the fashion seen in the adult; no trace of bone has appeared, save in the sides of the mandible. The roof of the skull never chondrifies, but is covered in by secondary bones. Like the skull of an adult Shark or Skate, the whole chondro-cranium is one continuous structure—all save the post-oral arches. The auditory mass is now environed by cartilage stretching over the back of the head—the occipital, and by wing-like growths that wall-in the bulk of the brain behind the eyes—the alisphenoid (a.s.) The high [9:3:703] orbito-nasal wall is one continuous plate of cartilage, seemingly only a crest upgrowing from the coalesced tract of the trabeculae. The arched wings of this part, which we saw in the first stage, can be seen to be marked off into three regions—an aliethmoid (al.e.), an aliseptal (αZ.s.), and an alinasal (aZ.n.); in the latter is the external nostril, and dividing the eye from the nose is a flat partition, the pars plana (p.p.) Between the nasal openings and their curtains and valves, the prenasal cartilage (p.n), still arcuate, is yet rising in front; whilst, behind and above, the great middle wall (eth.) terminates by a bud of cartilage, which marks the fore-end of the cranial cavity, and the groove on each side below this is for the nerve of smell (1). The oval pituitary space has become a neat round opening, through which the internal carotid arteries enter; it never chondrifies below, and has to be floored afterwards by secondary bone. The upper hyoid element (st.) has now freed itself from the periotic cartilage, bringing away so much as serves for the dilated dorsal end, and thus leaving an open window (fenestra ovalis), to which this forms the accurately fitted shutter. In front of this small cartilage, the quadrate (q.) shows almost its adult form, and the double lower condyle fits into a sinuous concavity on the end of Meckel’s cartilage (mk.) This free bar—the mandible—sends backwards a posterior, and inwards an internal angular process. The later and feebler pterygopalatine sickles are now formed internally of small thinwalled spheroidal, and externally of fusiform, cells of a larger size. They ossify before chondrification can take place.

Interposed between the skin of the palate and fauces below and the basis cranii above, is a thick mat of granular tissue, which does not, however, chondrify, but ossifies as the parasphenoid and basi-temporal bones.

Cranium of Fowl—Third Stage.— After about three or four days, that is, about the middle of the second week of incubation, the chondro-cranium has not only undergone great changes in size and form, it is also now beginning to become an osteo-cranium. All that is cartilaginous has acquired a neat finish (figs. 7, 8); the occipital condyle (o.c.) is perfect; the super-occipital arch is complete (fig. 8, s.o.)∙, and bone is forming in three places in the occiput (n.c., e.o.), and the bone (pa.s.) which underlies the orbital septum has grafted itself upon the cartilage of the basi-sphenoidal region. That bone, the parasphenoid (r.b,8.), and the other investing bones, are now growing in the tissue between the skin and the cranio-facial elements; those that can be seen below are shown in figure 8, the remainder can be described in riper stages. The downward bend (not shown in the figure) of the prenasal rostrum (p.n.) is but gentle; this long spatulate continuation of the base of the orbitonasal septum, the “basi-trabecular bar,” or foremost keystone piece of the body, is now at its fullest height of growth, and ready to decline. It is now the accurate counterpart of the axis of the cutwater of Such Fishes as the Skate, Saw-fish, and Shark. Those who look for the under lying unity of the various types may here see how fit this unpaired rod is to have modelled on it all kinds of beaks of Birds. On this bar a tri-radiate patch of bone is formed right and left, leaving it as yet uncovered below, above, and at the fore-end. These are the young premaxillaries, and are bones that in most Birds, as in Osseous Fishes, overshadow and starve the upper jaw-bones, or maxillaries proper, so large, relatively, in most other types. Already they have each a palatine, a nasal, and a dentary process. The machinery of the first post-oral is shown (fig. 8), all save the free mandible, which will be described in a more advanced stage. The quadrate (q.) is ossifying; the pterygoid and palatines (pg., pa.) are ossified; they are very simple bars. Between the premaxillary and the quadrate are bones that have been formed in the outer part of the “maxillo-palatine process”.of the embryo; they are the feeble maxillary, with its ingrowing maxillo-palatine plate, and the still feebler jugal and quadrato-jugal (mx., mx.p.,

On the mid-line a grooved style of bone, the rostrum of the parasphenoid, carries the rounded lower edge of the [9:3:704] inter-orbital septum, and has grafted itself upon the cartilage of the pituitary ring, causing it also to ossify. On each side, behind these new bony patches, a free tongue of cartilage is seen. These tongues are the apices of the trabecular bars. They are better seen in the partial view (fig. 7). Underflooring the fore-half of the main skull base, close behind the pituitary ossifications, the thick mat of sub-mucous tissue is fast becoming bony. There is a right and left squarish patch, very large and elegant; in the grooved mid-line a few osseous points are also seer., ready to grow right and left into the two plates, and to make them one. These are the basi-temporals (b.t.) They soon coalesce with the ossifying basi-sphenoid above, and they represent the handle of the dagger-shaped parasphenoid of the Frog.^[13. See article Amphibia, vol. i. p. 753, fig. 5, j p.s.] The super-occipital region (β.o.) is still soft, and the exoccipitals do not reach to the condyloid foramina (9). They begin at the hole for the vagus, and run to the selvedge at the foramen magnum (8, f.m.) The kidney-shaped transverse condyle (o.c.) has in its substance the diminishing notochord (n.c.), which, however, is better seen in the partial upper view (fig. 7, n.c.) This figure shows that the notochord has tried, as it were, to break up into three fusiform segments. The hinder of these is enclosed in an ectosteal sheath, which will affect with bony growth the neighbouring cartilage, right and left, to form the basi-occipital. The fore-part is narrower, and lies in an open space, the counterpart of the membranous floor (“posterior basi-cranial fontanelle ”— Rathke), which lies behind the pituitary space in the Snake’s embryo. On each side of the middle notochordal spindle are seen the elegant mammillary elevations caused by the enclosed cochleae (cl.) The internal carotids (t.c.) are seen creeping through the pituitary hole, and on each side the ossification has been set up, which forms the true endo-skeletal basi-sphenoid. On each side of the posterior pituitary or clinoid wall, the cartilage is pinched in to let the great trigeminal nerves pass over; but two parts of intensest interest are seen on each side of these shallow notches. These are the apices of the trabeculae (lg.), free-ended, curved tongues of cartilage, with dark cells in their interior, and fixed to the out-turned anterior ends of the parachordal cartilages, just where the new bony matter is seen. The meaning of these parts that make the pituitary region was not seen at the time by the author of the paper we are quoting (Parker “On the Fowl’s Skull”); further research was needed, and his figures are of much greater value than his descriptions.

Cranium of Fowl—Fourth Stage.— At the beginning of the third week of incubation the chondro-cranium is not only perfect as to form, but it has also so much increased its bony territories as to make it very useful for comparison with chondrosteous skulls of the lower types. When every investing bone has been removed, we get such a structure as is shown (from above) in fig. 9. Here the cranial basin has a short and fenestrate floor, and doubly-winged sides, which are gently scooped above, and form a pair of symmetrical ledges on which the widest part of the brain rests; whilst the floor dips much lower down, where the medulla oblongata and the pituitary body rest. The scooped fenestrate alisphenoids (a.s.) look inward, but fail to reach the median line by a great space, which space is filled in by no orbital wings, such as we should see in a Lizard Turtle, or Mammal. The whole orbital region is, in thé skull, a steep wall, having a retral crest on its fore-part, this crest being the rudiment of the large sheet of cartilage (tegmen cranit), which is thrown over the brain in the young Salmon.^[14. See “Salmon’s Skull,” op. cit., plate 4, fig. 2, t.cr.] This wall (p.s.), this crest, and the elegant cartilaginous awning in front of the crest, containing valves and folded curtains of most cunning construction (see figs. 10 and 11)—all these have grown out of that inter-nasal plate formed by the trabeculae as their commissure (figs. 1 and 2, tr.)

Morphologically considered, these are added and distinct elements, but their differentiation from the trabeculae cannot be seen well until now, and even now it is imperfect. The leafy coverings of cartilage are seen to dip down on each side of the prenasal, spatula in front, and the cartilage at this part forms a coiled, valvular nose-lid — the “alinasal region.” From this, in its inside, there hangs a curtain, all of cartilage (fig. 10, n.tb.), the “alinasal turbinal.” It curves towards the septum, and then turns upwards below to become parallel to the inturned nasal wall (l.n.w.) Behind the alinasal comes the aliseptal region (al.s.)∙, and when cut across at the notch behind it and the hinder part of the roof, it shows a doubly coiled outgrowth, the “inferior turbinal” (fig. 11, i.tb.) The hinder region or “aliethmoid” is the true olfactory region; the roof suddenly turns inward, and is coiled upon itself, so as to form the bagpipe-shaped upper turbinals, whose swollen faces look inwards to the mesethmoid. Behind their inturned part they send down a cartilaginous curtain, the pars plana, or antorbital plate, the fore-face of which [9:3:705] does not develop any obvious “middle turbinal” as in Man.

The differentiation of distinct morphological regions, which did not become obvious in the membrano-cranium, can now be seen to some extent in the well-developed cartilage. As in the Ratitoe, the orbito-nasal septum was, in the second stage, a continuous sheet of cartilage.^[15. See Parker “On Ostrich Skull,” Phil. Trans., 1866, plate 7, fig. 2, p.e., and plate 8, fig. 10, p.e.]

Looking upon the trabeculae as the first facial arch, correlated to and supplied by the orbito-nasal nerve, we see why there should be a segmentation of this uppermost and foremost part of the face into a suspensorium and a free arch, such as is seen next behind in the mandible.

This segmentation has commenced, and, oddly enough, that part of the trabecular commissure which will be absorbed has not lost its original flap-shape (see fig. 12, c.f.c., s.v.l.) The hourglass - shaped window here formed by metamorphic action will become a notch in a day or two, and the flat region of the trabeculae will be absorbed. Thus we get the Tinamine stage;^[16. “On Ostrich Skull,” plate 15, fig. 8, s.n.,p.e., c y f,c.] for in that intermediate form between the Ratite and Carinate types—the Tinamou— the metamorphic processes are stayed midway, and the bird is a native, so to speak, of the Struthio-Gallinaceous “marches.” Beneath the retral ethmoidal spike is seen the olfactory groove (1.); whilst in front of the cranio-facial fenestra (c.∕.c.), the orbito-nasal nerve (n.n.) grooves the septum, gets bridged over by it, and creeps down to its own proper facial bar—the trabeculae. And the result of the metamorphosis in this Carinate bird is the formation of a pear-shaped fenestra (i.o.f.) between the eyeballs. This window waβ not cut out by Nature in a fit of economy (as the mere teleologists vainly speak), but is a fairly commenced separation of the common crest of the coalesced trabeculae from the ethmoid forwards and the presphenoid behind (p.e., p.s.)

The notch behind the cartilaginous frame of this window is formed by membrane into the optic foramen. A line drawn horizontally along the base of the fenestra, and another vertically to the upper margin of its narrow end, would mark out the starved presphenoid, without alee, of this bird: for the mesethmoid and the basi-sphenoid (p.e., b.s.) meet below the fenestra. Underneath the inter-orbital plate the parasphenoid balk (quite distinct) is seen, and underneath the basal bones the basi-temporal slab (b.t.) Turning again to the bird’s-eye view (fig. 9.), we see that the notochord is now enclosed in a spearhead-shaped bone, the basi-occipital (δ.o.) It is ridged above by the enclosed notochord, and, behind, the swelling halves of the condyle (o.c.) are seen. This basal bone is truncated in front, and forms the hinder margin of the wide rounded “posterior basicranial fontanelle” (p.b.f.) On each side are the exoccipitals (e.o.), and, above, the perfected occipital arch has a pair of super-occipitals (s.o.) as in man. The outer occipital region is grooved to receive the investing bones, and has tympanic wings to enlarge and protect that cavity. On each side of the fore-part of the basi-occipital is seen the cochlea (cZ.); and in the ledge above the main periotic bone, the prootic (pro.) is largely spreading (the two lesser ossicles are appearing, but will be better shown in the next stage). The foramen ovale (5) is very large; it is bounded behind by the prootic, and in front by the alisphenoid (a.s.) This “great wing” has a large central fenestra, round which the bone has crept. In somewhat younger specimens this bony matter was in two patches, one above and another below the fenestra. The same thing may be seen in arboreal birds, as the Common Sparrow.

The stem of the alisphenoid almost meets its fellowprocess over the posterior clinoid wall (p.cl.) In the stem is seen a “foramen rotundum.” Outside, the alisphenoid has a thick, secondary, post-frontal (sphenotic) wing (p f.) The round pituitary space is walled in with bone. Its secondary parasphenoidal floor has been removed. We reserve a description of the fast-growing roof bones for the next stage, when they are most instructive for comparison with those of Fishes and Reptiles.

Cranium of Fowl—-Fifth Stage.— In a day or two after [9:3:706] hatching, the skull of the chicken is excellent tor comparison; as in Cattle, so in the Fowl and its relations, “their young ones are in good liking” as soon as they appear; hence they are strong in bone and sinew very early, the growth-processes taking place rapidly.

The under view (fig. 13) shows, behind the orbits, a strong cranial box. Synchondroses of the remainder of the chondrocranium divide the endo-skeletal bone-territories; and that organic attraction which causes the perfect correlation of the shallow with the deeper layers of the mesoblast, has given us here bony encasements, that not only fill in what was wanting in the chondro-cranium, but also overlie and double the strength of the ossified cartilage itself. All is neat and finished now, and now is the nick of time in which can be seen most of the sutures, so soon to be obliterated by the almost universal ankylosis that takes place afterwards—a process by which Nature, in the Bird, rapidly fills in nearly all her footprints. Here she is as hard to bind as Proteus himself; and the morphological worker is often sore bestead to catch all the transformations. If the chick were to retain throughout life its present form of face, it would much resemble a Hemipod. We have seen how its skull becomes metamorphosed from a lower into a higher and a still higher type day by day.

This basal view shows that the bony pieces of the occipital arch are fast forming a strong ring, after the manner of a vertebra. The keystone piece (s.o.) is now one bone, with the remains of the suture above. The notochord still exists in the basal piece (b.o.), and is seen in the condyle, the dimple of which is caused by it. The basi-temporal plate (6.i.) is now a low triangle, with its base behind; the base is, as it were, gnawed, the jagged edge joining the overlying spheno-occipital by a squamous suture. This thick plate is emarginate in front, below the meeting of the eustachian tubes (ew.), and this notch is the mark of the original symmetry of this double bone. Grooved gently at the mid-line, the basi-temporal is mammillate on each side, these elegant swellings being due to the cochleae that are encysted in the ossifying cartilage above. Behind, it is eared, and over these ears the internal carotids creep as they seek the pituitary space ready to form the “circle of Willis.” The bone above and in front of the basi-temporal is a compound of the rostral parasphenoid and the proper basi-sphenoid. Altogether, this is a very extensive and multiform element. -Directly in front of the basi-temporal it is scooped at the meeting of the eustachian tubes— diverticula of the first visceral cleft. In front of that part the rostrum'is soon a free structure, grooved for the interorbital septum; but behind and above the basi-temporal the bony mass is all one, and it has an upper and a lower wing on each side behind the strong wall which it has built around the pituitary well. The upper of these wings are ossifications of that cartilage which we saw was formed by coalescence of the sub-apical part of the trabeculae with the fore-end of the parachordal plates.

The large posterior basi-cranial fontanelle has now become the deep chink which exists as a ditch between these post-pituitary banks (fig. 14, p.b.f.) On the upper surface the chink reaches the basi-occipital; in the horizontal section (fig. 14) it is cut away behind.

The lower and outer pair of wings of the basi-sphenoid are very large (figs. 13 and 14); they build, on each side, the anterior tympanic recess (α.i.r.), and their starting point of growth is from the free apices of the trabeculae, which are thus feathered with these large coiled laminae of periosteal bone that enclose another diverticulum of the first visceral cleft, which lies over the eustachian passage.

Close in front of the eustachian groove the soldered part of the rostrum widens into a pair of projections, and, upon these, obliquely placed facets of cartilage are attached for articulation with counterpart cartilages on the pterygoid bones (pg.)

These perfectly distinct cartilages are the result of a peculiar metamorphosis of the outstanding (basi-pterygoid) spurs of the trabeculae. In the Iiatitoe, as in Lizards and Serpents on the one hand and Mammals on the other, these external pterygoid plates or processes are a direct outgrowth of cartilage, the posterior conjugational spurs that grow out for union with the pterygo-palatine arcade.^[17. See Phil. Trans. 1866, plate 7, fig. 4, a.p.; and ibid., 1874, plate 34, fig. 2, e.psf.] Like the subdivision of the ethmo-trabecular wall, this segmentation of originally continuous cartilage is of the highest morphological importance. Several other things of this kind will be found in this class, where the Vertebrate pattern has been specialized and metamorphosed to its highest degree, as if to produce types that should be as imagines in relation to the forms beneath them. The remainder of the rostrum just runs, pointed, to the edge of the cranio facial cleft (fig. 16, r.b.s. to a.p.) In front of this notch the septum nasi is seen, narrow and rounded, and it terminates below in the starving prenasal (s.n.,p.n.) Around and in front of that rod the now single premaxillary clings; it has its under surface grooved to the end, where that rod lay, its sides developed into the sharpdentary region (fig. 13, d.px.), and its under part growing backwards as two nearly parallel bands, the palatine processes (p.px.), that articulate with the palatine bones (pa.) These latter bones run backwards in the same gently diverging manner, and then curve inwards to be tied the one to the other, before they bend outward again, foot-like, to articulate with the pterygoids (pg. ) These palatines are very simple; they give off from their main bars merely a scooped lamina, growing towards the skull base, becoming the ethmo-palatine in front; and this part articulates with a splint of the trabecular arch, the small styliform vomer (v.), which is notched behind, bluntly pointed in front, and primarily azygous.

The pterygoids (pg.) are stout little bony mallets, with a pad, as if of leather—the cartilaginous articular meniscus. Where each bone glides on the similarly padded trabecular region these facets look upwards and inwards. The end of the palatine is articulated by strong fibres to a sinuous notch on the fore-end of the pterygoid. This notch is bounded by the basi-pterygoid facet below, and by a stunted ti meso-pterygoid process” above, which rides over the palatine. It is arrested in the Gallinaceae, and never becomes segmented off (see below). The hinder end of the pterygoid is scooped below to articulate with the counterpart knob on the front face of the quadrate. A joint cavity is formed here. Above that joint, and looking upwards and forwards, is a very stunted a epi-pterygoid” process, which clings to, and is strongly strapped upon, the quadrate by fibrous tissue.
[9:3:707]

The large quadrate bone (figs. 13 and 15, q.) has its free pedicle or orbital process still soft above. Its otic process has a larger rounded head for the squamosal (sq.), and a lesser rounded head for the prootic within. In front of the otic process is a sort of trochanter or spur. Below, the articular facet is somewhat divided, by a shallow fossa, into an outer larger and an inner lesser facet. The otic process passes through the front of the tympanic cavity (first cleft), and becomes involved in the membrane thereto attached, namely, the membrana tympani. It was mistaken by anatomists of the last generation for the true tympanic bone. Behind this bone (see fig. 13) there are seen two holes, the inner of them leads to the auditory fenestrae (ovalis and rotunda), and the outer is the opening into a gallery which communicates, by means of diploe, with one on the other side. These are the “upper tympanic recesses,” and have their counterparts in the Crocodile. Besides the pterygoid and palatine, in that part of the mandibular arch which i§ folded over the mouth, —for the first post-oral enfolds itself to make all the lower and much of the upper jaw,—there are in the outer part of the maxillo-palatine process three bones formed on each side, as we have seen.

The first of these is the bony ichihyic maxillary (».), with a bony foot, that grows inwards and backwards in a falcate manner, to articulate with the sides of the fore-end of the vomer. These are the maxillo-palatine processes (mx. p. y ) Behind the maxillary, overlapping its jugal process, is the styloid jugal (j.); and behind this, and overlapping it, the quadrato-jugal, which is hooked to fit in the side of the base of the quadrate behind (qj., qi) There is a small joint cavity at this place.

The side view (fig. 15) illustrates the above description; but .it also shows much that is not visible below. The section (fig. 16) helps us still further.

. The roofing bones are now well seen; the largest of these are the frontals (∕.), which form the upper crescent of the Large circle of the eye. They flatten in front, where they are overlapped by the nasals and nasal processes of the premaxillaries (n.px.)— a peculiarly ornithic character amongst the higher vertebrata. The orbital rim is very neat and perfect; the main part of the bone, covering the hemisphere, is a convex radiating scale. Inside the orbit the bone sends inwards a thin scooped orbital process (∕.), on whose convex surface the sloping brain rests. This fails to invest the fontanelle, and the orbito-sphenoids, as yet, are not. The somewhat oblong and also convex parietals (/>.) stop up the gap as far as to the occipital arch; they are much smaller than the frontals. Both the parietals and frontals are flanked and in some degree overlapped by the squamosals (s7.), which are more irregular in shape than, but are fully as large as, the parietals. Half the inner face is seen within (fig. 16, sq.)∙, the whole upper edge behind is hidden in this view, and much of the lower part, which forms a strong eave over the huge ear-mass. The lower edge has a cup for the quadrate main head. On the outside (fig. 15) there is to be noticed a variable cartilaginous tract; it takes in all the elegant crescentic tympanic wing of the exoccipitals (i.^.o.), and also runs in front of and between the ex-and super-occipitals (e.o., s.o.) Between the two bones is the posterior opisthotic region; in front of the exoccipital is the epiotic region. From the inside the imbrication of the cranial and auditory bones is seen to be very regular and remarkable. Running round and across, behind and below the posterior margin of the frontal, we see the fenestrate alisphenoid (a.s.) underskirting the orbital plate of the frontal, then the hollowed inner face of the squamosal, and behind and above that the scooping of the parietal. Below the same, and also behind it, we have—above, two bones, the prootic in front [9:3:708] and the super-occipital behind. But the latter takes in all the breadth behind, whilst below the prootic are two, the upper the smaller; the lesser bone is the opisthotic, the larger, rounding the foramen magnum at its sides, is the exoccipital (op., e.o.) These are infero-lateral elements. Below the whole are the basi-sphenoid and the basi-occipital, both of them underfloored by the basi-temporal (b.o.,b.t.) So much tilted backwards is the auditory mass that the crown of the anterior canal (α.s.c.) is imbedded in the super-occipital. In a Lizard, Snake, or Turtle that part would be first enclosed in a separate epiotic bone, which would be soon confluent with the super-occipital. But in these high Sauropsida the epiotic is a small, late centre, formed behind the commencement of the anterior canal in the front part of the recess in which the “flocculus” lies. Also the opisthotic is small, but is distinct for three or four months; it is a wèdge of bone, flat-faced within, forming a straight suture with the hind edge of the prootic, and externally runs as a fine thread of bone between the two fenestrae of the labyrinth. We do not see this bone behind until afterwards, and it soon coalesces with the exoccipital, first with it and afterwards with the prootic, as in Lizards and Snakes. 1 After the elements of the chondrifying cranium have run into each other, the enclosed ear organs, by their copious growth, and also by their having many diverticula, such as the cochlea and canals, trespass on neighbouring territories, so that whilst the cochleae burrow into the parachordal region, the semicircular canals find room in the occipital arch.

In the Osseous Fish (“Salmon’s Skull," Phil, Trans., 1873, plate 5, fig. 8, sp.o.) there is a large bone called the “post-frontal” by Cuvier; in the Bird it often occurs, and looks like a secondary wing on the great sphenoidal wing (alisphenoid). In the Fish it covers the ampulla of the anterior canal; in the Bird it is in front of it and of the whole labyrinth. This bone, the “sphenotic,” is ossified at the time of hatching.

The anterior sphenoidal region is all soft as yet (figs. 15 .and 16, p.s.f, and the great mesethmoidal wall (p.e.} covers only a third of its own proper territory. It now reaches to the notch; nearly to the roof also, but not to the para sphenoid. The cartilage it is ossifying is continued as an isthmus connecting the parts behind and in front of the notch (cranio-facial hinge). Through this notch (fig. 16, n.tb.') we see the swollen upper turbinal: and the nasal canal and bridge for the fore-part of the trabecular nerve is seen near the hind margin of the steep and well-formed septum nasi (s.n.), which has projecting from it the lessening rostrum (p.nj) Bridging over the notch, and let into the fore-edge of the frontal, are the never-coalesced nasal processes of the premaxillaries. Outside these, on each side (never in the middle in a Bird), are the nasals (fig. 15, n.) They are curious twisted bones, two-bladed in Iront to bind round the alinasal cartilages (αZ.n.) and outer nostril (e.Λ.); behind, they twist a little downwards the inner edge of their flat end. Tied by fibres to the side of the narrowed end of the frontal, and to that part of the nasal which is imbedded into it, is the lachrymal (fig. 15, Z.) Its main part is the super-orbital, and this sends downwards a facial process, narrow and sigmoid. Within the lachrymal is the pars plana (p.p.'), a subquadrate curtain, which is persistently cartilaginous in the Fowl, whose nasal labyrinth, unlike that of many birds, scarcely ossifies at all, except the main dividing wall, the perpendicular ethmoid, which always early becomes solid.

The free mandibular bars are now continuous at their fore or lower end; the long and strong dentaries (figs. 15 and 16, c7.) early coalesce. In front they cover the attenuating Meckel’s cartilage (mk.); this, however, grows on behind, and its inner process (i.a.p.) is ossifying as the “articulare,” the only endo-skeletal bone in the mandible. Behind, outside, and a little within, we see an upper and a lower splint, the surangular and the angular (su., a.), and on the inner side, further forwards, the oblong splenial (sp.)∙ i but in this bird there has not been found a “coronoid,” common in certain groups of Birds, besides Snakes, Lizards, and Crocodiles. In this and in other things the Fowl is often found wanting as to special elements.

The changes in the hyoid arch can be left until we come to the adult stage.

Cranium of Fowl—Sixth Stage.— This stage, which is that of chickens less than a month old, is introduced to show the occipital region from behind (fig. 17). This end view shows much that is ornithically characteristic. The subject was a somewhat starved chicken, whose retardation of growth caused a lingering of the ankylosis, which so soon removes all landmarks. Even now the great fontanelle, or membranous roof of the basin-like chondro-cranium, is barely covered by the still scant frontals and parietals (∕., y>.); their flanking by the big squamosals (sg ’ ∙), and the projection beyond these of the sphenotics, are well shown. A wholly cartilaginous epiotic region is still seen; it runs also inwards to the foramen magnum (∕.w.), and still skirts the tympanic ala (e.o.) But on the upper and outer edge of the exoccipital a small plot is taken from the great exoccipital. This is the appearance through the cartilage of the opisthotic (op.); and this represents the permanent condition of the occipital arch in the Chelonia, which shows a free posterior face of the opisthotic above and outside the exoccipital. This view also shows how the skull is doublefloored by the addition of the basi-temporal slab to the ossifying chondro-cranium (b.t., b.o.) Cranium of Fowl—Seventh Stage.— In chickens two months old, a section of the skull shows all the sutures except those lost by early fusion of the three para-sphenoidal elements w ith the compound basi-sphenoidal ossifying cartilage. The periotic elements are all distinct, not only from each other, but also from their surroundings {Phil. Trans. 1869, plate 85, fig. 1.) The bony orbito-nasal wall (perpendicular ethmoid) has grown by metamorphosis of the cartilage up to, and somewhat over and under, the inter-orbital fenestra; thus half of this large septum is bony. There is no osseous presphenoid, but instead of the true orbito-sρhenoids two osseous centres have appeared on 1 The nomenclature of these parts is wrong in Mr Parker’s paper on the “Fowl’s Skull,” Phil. Trans., 1869; but he named their elements correctly in his former paper on the “Struthious Skull,” ibid., 1866. Researches into the growth of the Reptilian skull have helped to correct the error. He has found a true “pterotic” in the Sparrow-Hawk (Monthly Micros. Jour., Feb. 1,1873); that was the name given by him to the fowl’s epiotic, whilst the latter name was applied to the posterior face of the opisthotic.
[9:3:709]

the post-orbital fontanelle, the foremost being the smaller bone; these help the orbital plate of the frontal to cover the eyeball with bone. In front of the doubly notched ethmoidal wall the face is connected with the skull by a narrow band of cartilage, which is never quite severed in this type. Thus the fore-face lifts on the skull in harmony with the depression of the mandible, by means of the elasticity of the parts, for, as we have seen, the firm splints above—nasals and nasal processes of the premaxillaries—are let into the frontal by their fibrous, lathy ends.

Cranium of Fowl—Eighth Stage—Chicles Three Months old.— Many sutures still remain at this stage, but those between the occipital and periotic elements are fast filling up {Phil. Trans., 1869,plate85,figs. 4-7,p. 794). Wemustrefer the reader to the work above cited for the details; no stage shows the exquisite architecture of the ornithic skull more lucidly than this. The synchondroses are reduced to fine lines or sutures, and the size of the object is of great importance, as tending to make a difficult study easy to the observer.

Cranium of Foιvl—Ninth Stage.— Iu chickens of the first winter, eight or nine months old, nearly full-sized, but yet succulent even in their skeleton, many things are to be observed {op. cit., plates 86, 87, figs. 1-3, p. 795).

On the roof the sagittal suture is only obliterated in the parietal region, and the super-occipital still retains an upper notch. The occipital and auditory regionshave entirely coalesced—the opisthotic with the exoccipital first, and then with the prootic; but the little epiotic seems to melt into the common mass of the ankylosing super-occipital and prootic, without any precedence either way. All the sutures across the cranio-facial hinge are still visible, namely, those made by the frontals, lachrymals, nasals, and nasal processes of the premaxillaries, in their relations. Where the frontals diverge by narrowness in front, behind the nasal processes of the premaxillaries, there the ethmoid is seen becoming fast bony from the substance of the perpendicular plate, and not by a separate upper bone, as in the Struthionidce. ^[18. ’ Ph'd. Trans., 1866, plate 8, fig. 10, eth., p.β,] As to the facial bones, they yet retain much distinctness, and the prenasal and Meckelian rods still linger. The articular end of the latter rod is now ossifying fast, the two angular processes, so large in this type, are now bony. The fast coalescing roof and the coalesced floor are now of great thickness, and the diploë in this type is coarse {op. cit., plate 86, fig. 14). In all these growing stages, tracing bone by bone, as it appears, we have not yet met with the presphenoid, nor seen the behaviour of the great ethmoidal wall in relation to the hinder skull. In the most advanced winter chickens these things are to be seen (fig. 18, p.s., p.e., b.s.^)

The presphenoidal region is merely that band of cartilage which lies partly above, but mainly behind, the fenestra {i.o.f.). A small ossicle has appeared in it close below the second orbito-sphenoid {p.s., o.s. 2), the foremost orbito-sphenoid {o.s. 1) has coalesced with the perpendicular ethmoid.

From that bone the rostrum of the parasphenoid is still distinct {r.b.s.), but the perpendicular plate has now reached the basi-sphenoid {p.e., b.s.), and between them, and below the stül soft lower part of the presphenoid, there is a high vertical suture. This suture, and this steep bony wall beneath the presphenoid, are of the greatest interest to the morphologist. We saw that the basisphenoid was compound, having in it, besides the parasphenoidal elements as investing parts, both the parachordal ends and the trabecular apices. So it is, for the Bird’s skull runs over, or rather is built upon, the marvellously metamorphosed first visceral arch — the arch formed by the primordial “trabeculae cranii.” Counting from the spine, we have three cranial sclerotomes in the osseous stage. The first is formed on a notochordal and parachordal foundation; this is the “basi-occipital.” The next is formed on a foundation partly parachordal and partly facial—the basi-sphenoid. The third is the “presphenoid,” and it is tilted up over the forth-growing trabecular arch, the elements of which early coalesce at the mid-line, and the common crest of which is not, for a long time, in any way actually separate from the approximating roofs of the nasal sacs.

Cranium of Fowl—Tenth Stage.— In old birds we find an intense degree of ankylosis, and yet certain sutures are persistent to old age, or at least show some chink or mark of their original separateness. In this the Fowl agrees with most birds, but, being at no great height above the [9:3:710] f Struthιonid<x,it is not the strongest example of what a Bird s skull may be. In a bird’s-eye view we see the separateness of the nasals, the nasal processes of the premaxillaries, the fore-end of the frontals, the top of the ethmoid, and the lachrymals (fig. 19, n.px., n.,f., eth., l.). Below (fig. 20), the premaxillaries still have sutures with the palatinesand maxillaries, and the latter has its jugal process, the jugal itself, and the quadrato-jugal, all distinct (px., pa., mx.,j., q.j.)

Moreover, the quadrate (g r .), pterygoid (pg.), the palatines, and of necessity the mandible—all these retain their joints, and traces of the union of the mandibular splints are long retained (fig. 21, d., ar.). So also do the elements of the hyoid arch, soon to be described, remain separate.

The whole cranial box, and all the inter-orbital region, have become one bone, whilst the various fontanelles are filled in. In the specimen which has been figured the inter-orbital fenestra (i.o.f.) is partly open, but it is often obliterated. Also we see that free periosteal bony growths have bridged over the temporal fossa, the post-frontal or “sphenotic” having met and coalesced with a zygomatic process of the squamosal (p.f., sq.). In the lower view we still see the notochordal dimple on the transvp,γsp. occipital condyle (o.c.), and the hinder margin of the basitemporal plate is still traceable in front of the passages for the vagus and the internal carotid burrows (i.c.)° This thick bony mass is totally ankylosed to the basi-sphenoidal region above. The prootic and alisphenoidal regions are land-marked below by the foramen ovale (5), which is sometimes, as in Fishes, divided into two by a bony bar. So free is the bony growth that the basi-temporal has coalesced with the temporal wing of the exoccipital (b.t., e.o.), and in front of this bridge we see a number of passages, burrows, galleries, windows, <tc., leading above to the upper tympanic recess, in front to the anterior tympanic recess, below that to the eustachian opening, and on the middle of the inner face of the drum cavity a large hole which leads to the two fenestrae. The various bones of the palate are scarcely in the least changed in form or relative size since the time of hatching (fig. 20), and the copious growths of cartilage belonging to the nasal labyrinth are always soft; these are not figured in the adult skull. There are, however, a few bony centres, the feeble representatives of the ossifications found amongst higher birds in this region. Thus, close in front of the broad wall-top of the ethmoid, in the substance of the septum nasi, there are two small ossicles, and on each side a similar bony point; the rest remained unossified, all save a small part of the attached margin of the pars plana.

The attenuated remains of the second post-oral, and the larger third post-oral arch, contain persistent cartilage. The elegant “columella auris” (fig. 22) is bony where it fits into the fenestra ovalis (st.), and the shaft, up to its rays (m.st.), also; but the short, notched supra-stapedial (s.st.), the tongue-shaped and fenestrate extra-stapedial (e.st.), and the slender, combined infra-stapedial and stylohyal (i.st.), all these are still cartilaginous. 1 The rest of the second post-oral is reduced to the arrowhead-shaped lingual bone, the coalesced and partly ossified cerato-hyals (c.h.), and an elegant ridged phalangiform basi-hyal (b.h.) The free end of the combined glossal piece is soft. There is no tympanic in the Fowl; only in the Peafowl have we found one, and it is behind the membrane. The next arch, the thyro-hyal (first branchial in Ichthyopsida), is composed of two almost equal rods; the upper is only ossified in its 1 Sometimes, even in the Fowl, the infra-stapedial has a spatulate stylo-hyal at its free end (see Professor Huxley’s figure, Proc. Zool. Soc., May 27 1869, p. 399, fig. 5 B, I. S.) [9:3:711] distal third, and the lower is mainly bony; their basal piece is largely soft behind (fig. 15, e.br., c.br., b.lrr.).

The skull of the Fowl, and of the Alectoromorphoe generally, differs in certain respects from that of other Sehizognathoe. In the Gallinaceoe, as in the desmognathousAαpαees, the vomer is single; in Pigeons and Sand-Grouse it is absent; in all the others with opeu palates it is composed of two halves soldered more or less together. Some of the Schizo- qnathoe possess an “os uncinatum ”—as the Albatross and the Gull—a bone to be described hereafter; and others possess a pair of bones attached to the double vomer, namely, the “septo-maxillaries,” known in Reptiles as the so-called “inferior turbinals.” These bones, very small in all Birds, have been found by Mr Parker at the top and the bottom, as it were, of the schizognathous series; that is, in the Humming-bird (Patagona gig as), and in the Kagu {Rhinochetus jubatus). The latter is a Gruine bird, lying on the margin of the group towards the Night-Herons, whilst the Hummingbirds are certainly amongst the most specialized types. All the Schizo- gnathoe, except the Fowl tribe, have “meso-pterygoids.” In certain Sehizo- gnathoe there is an “inferior labial” on the edge of the mandible, namely, in the Rallidoe {e.g., Fulica atra and Gallinula chloropus). These were found by the writer many years ago. Upper labials have not as yet turned up in these types, although they have been figured carefully in the Rhea {Phil. Trans., 1866, plate 10, fig. 14, on each side of r.b.s., close under the inferior turbinal t.i.), and the Rhea is a much lower type than the birds under notice. As in the Gallinaceoe, the Sehizognathoe generally have little development of the tympanic ring, but in Aegialitis hiaticula there is one large and three or four lesser bones on each side; they occur in Numenius arquata.

A full and adequate idea of the degree of the metamorphosis of a Vertebrate skull attained to in Birds can only be obtained by observation of what is to be seen in that of the higher arboreal types. But some of the Carinatoe are half Struthious, and they possess that low kind of skull which is called “Dromseo-gnathous,” best seen in Dromoeus, the Emeu.^[19. Phil. Τrαηs., 1866, plates 11-13.] This kind of skull once understood, the relation of that of the Fowl to that of types far above and far below it will be clearly seen; for we must describe the Desmo-

gnathous, Aegithognathous, and Saurognathous varieties also.

The Dromaeognathous Type—Cranium of Tinamus variegatus.—Professor Huxley {Clas. of Birds, p. 425) says, “The Dromaeognathous birds are represented by the single genus Tinamus, which (as Mr Parker has shown)^[20. A note is given below as follows “On the Osteology of Gallinaceous Birds and Tinamous (Transactions of the Zoological Society, vol. V. 1864). Sundevall, however, had already said of, Tinamus, Rhynchotus, and Cryρturus, ‘ Struthiones parvos referunt. The last two are merely sub-genera of Tinamus. . , . .] has a completely struthious palate. In fact, the vomer is very broad, and in front unites with the maxillo-palatine plates, as in Dromoeus, while behind it receives the posterior extremities of the palatines and anterior ends of the pterygoid bones, which thus are prevented, as in the Ratitoe, from entering into any extensive articulation with the basisphenoidal rostrum. The basi - pterygoid processes spring from the body of the sphenoid [they are not segmented plates of •cartilage attached to the parasphenoid, as in the true Carinatoe (see above)], not from the rostrum, and they articulate with the pterygoid very near the distal or outer ends of the latter bones.” In the Fowl, as we have just seen, the fore-end, or main part of the pterygoid, glides on the rostral plate. “The head of the quadrate bone is single, as in the Struthious Birds (Parker, Z.c.)” To this we may add that the basi-temporals are very feebly developed, as we find from examination of three adult species :— T. robustus, T. variegatus, and T. brasiliensis sive major ^[21. The writer hopes to show the development of this type of skull at some future time; an embryo of Rhynchotus rufescens is treasured up for this purpose.] f

If Professor Huxley’s description be compared with the accompanying figure (⅛4) of the Tinamine skull this variety will be easily understood; the lettering is the same as in the figures of the Fowl’s skull. For further details the reader is referred to Mr Parker’s Memoirs above referred to, especially that on the Struthious types {PhU. Trans. 1866, plates 7-15).

The Desmognathous Type of Skτdl.— This kind of skull occurs in such a variety of families that, notwithstanding its importance to the morphologist, it is not of so great a value to the zoologist. Nor indeed is it quite equal to some of the grouns in value, being due to a [9:3:712] condition arising rather from an excess of osseous deposits than from any very striking metamorphosis of primordial elements. The skull of the Schizognathae easily runs, as it were, into this type; whilst it crops up among such simple palates as those of the Fowl tribe, namely, in Crax globicera ; and Talegalla Lathami in old age is nearly desmognathous. So also on the Λrdeine borders of the Gru·idae, the Kagu (Rhinochel·us jubatus), ^[22. See Trans. Zοοl. Sοc., vol. vi. plates 91 and 92.] is almost a Night-Heron, and nearly desmognathous. In another region Nyctibius almost comes across to the gigantic Goatsuckers (Pod argus) and the Oil-bird (Steatornis). (See Huxley, Clas. of Birds, p. 456.) In the paper just referred to (p. 453) the Desmognathae are thus described :—“Those Cuvierian Grallae and Natatores which are not schizognathous, the Accipitres or Raptores, the Scansores [excluding the Picidae], and among the Passeres, most of the Fissirostres, all the Syηdactyli, and IIpupa, may be termed desmognathous. In these birds the vomer is often abortive, or so small that it disappears from the skeleton. When it exists it is always slender, and tapers to a point anteriorly. The maxillo-palatines are united across the middle line, either directly or by intermediation of ossifications in the nasal septum. The posterior ends of the palatines and anterior ends of the pterygoids articulate directly with the rostrum, as in the preceding division” [the Schizognathae).

It is possible to make several important divisions in the kind and degree of desmognathism, as follows, namely—

a. Direct. — In Falcons and Geese, the maxillo-palatines meet below at the mid-line, as in the Mammal. Two sub-varieties of this form occur, as in the Falcon, where the nasal septum is ankylosed to this hard palate, and in the Goose, where it remains free.

b. Indirect. — This is very common, and is best seen in Eagles, Vultures, and Owls. The maxillo-palatines are ankylosed to the nasal septum, but are separated from each other by a chink.

c. Imperfectly direct. — This is where the maxillo-palatine plates are united by harmony-suture and not by coalescence. Example— Dicholophus cristatus. In young Falcons and Hawks the palate is at first indirect, is then imperfectly direct, and at last perfectly direct.

d. Imperfectly indirect. — Here the maxillo-palatines are closely articulated with, and separated by, the “median septo-maxillary,’’ but there is no ankylosis. Example— Megalaema asiatica. e. Double Desmogηathism. — This is seen in Podargus, where the palatines as well as the maxillaries largely coalesce below; to a less extent this is seen also in the larger Hornbills (Buceros). (Huxley, op. cit., pp. 445, 446, figs. 27, 28.)

f. Lastly, a compound form, in which the aegithognathous skull becomes desmognathous, is seen in certain Coracomorphoe (Gymnorhina, <fcc.), as will be shown below.

Professor Huxley’s remark, that the vomer, “when it exists, is always slender, and tapers to a point anteriorly” (p. 435), is modified by a note he gives on the same page with regard to the broad emarginate vomer of Falco. It has a similar, but not equal, enlargement in front in the Sacred Ibis (Thresciorηis aethiopicus), and the knife-shaped vomer of the Duck tribe is often thick at the infero-anterior angle, as may be seen in Oedcmia nigra, Querquedula caudacuta, and Mareca penelope, but the vomer of the Chenomorphae is compound, and the antero-superior bone, whose lower angle in part is enlarged, is the median septo-maxillary: this may be seen in young Geese, and in the adult Crested Screamer (Chauna chava∏a).

Here it will be necessary, in order to show the value of these types of skull, to insert Professor Huxley’s masterly handling of the modifications of the desmognathous skull, and the groups in which it is present. It is open to us, however, to modify some statements of his and to superadd others, for the observation of which the present writer has had much greater leisure, and the advantage of having dwelt long on the subject.

At page 460 (op. oil.) we read: “Not fewer than seven groups of families appear to me to be clearly distinguishable in this subdivision, viz., the Chenomorphae, iAιQMmphi-morphae, the Pelargomorphae, the Dysporomorphae, thσ Aetomorphae, the Psittacomorphae, and the CoccygomorphaeT

1. The Chenomorphae. — “The lachrymal region is remarkably long [save in the Screamer (Chauηa) ∖ . The· basi-sphenoidal rostrum has oval, sessile, basi-pterygoid facets, like those of the Alectoromorphae. The flat and lamellar maxillo-palatines unite and form a bridge across the palate.” Yet each of these plates has a large obliquely-ascending process; the vomer lies on the groove formed by the union of the maxillo-palatines; the more or less ossified septum, in old age, coalesces, by its outstanding processes, with those plates. The internal, but especially also the posterior angle of the mandible is largely developed, and sσ also is the transpalatine angle of the palatine. The glossohyal is very large and spatulate, and the thyro-hyals are flat and broad where the two unite. A remarkable structure is found in Ducks and Swans, namely, an ossicle on each side between the palatines, and stretching towards the maxillo-palatine plate: these bones are the “interpalatines ;” they tend to carry on the hard palate.

2. The Amphimorphae. — “The genus Phoenicopterus isso completely intermediate between the Anserine birds on the one side and the Storks and Herons on the other, that it can be ranged with neither of these groups, but must stand as the type of a division by itself. Thus the skull has the long lachrymo-nasal region, the basi pterygoid facets [not so; see op. dt., p. 437, where they are truly said to be rudimentary—they are the merest prickles], the prolonged and recurved angles of the mandibles, the laminated horny-sheath of the Chenomorphae; but the maxillo-palatines are spongy [scarcely more so than in the Swan et hoc genus omne of the Anserines and Anatines], and the general structure of the rostrum is quite similar to that found in the Storks and Herons.” The nasals are thoroughly Anserine, having their crura separated by a rounded notch; their palatines are quite Anserine, but are broader behind, being exactly like those of the Screamer; and yet they cut off the meso-pterygoid, which coalesces with the palatine. This the Storks and their allies do; the Chenomorphae do not. The pterygoids are like those of Thresciornis and Platalea, but the vomer is intermediate between that of the Goose and the SpoonbilP. The orbital processes of the palatines, or “ethmo-palatines,” run together as arched laminae from the body of the bone to the maxillo-palatine floor. They are very shelllike at first, and are attenuated in front. They coalesce together, and send down a bony keel of exquisite thinness in their hinder part. There is a part separate from the rest in front, just where they begin to narrow; this is obviously the median septo-maxillary. Behind, where the palatines shoot below the rostrum of the sphenoid, each bone sends down a lamella; each of these is bound to its fellow by fibrous tissue, and between these the vomer is wedged; the thin plate belongs mutually to the palatines and the azygous vomer. In all the ordinary Chenomorphae the ethmo-palatine spurs are long; in Phoenicopterus enormously so; in the Screamer they are very short. Hence the palato-vomerine structures of tlιe Amphimorphae are Anserine, but much modified. So also in the hyoid apparatus; and the huge glosso-hyal is, although cartilaginous, the true counterpart of that of a Swan.
[9:3:713]

3. The Pelargomorphae. —“ There are no basi-pterygoid processes, and the palatines usually unite for a greater or less distance behind the posterior nares; but they send down no vertical plate from their junction.” In the Ardeidae they do not unite; in all these forms the coalesced part is short as compared with that of the Cormorants and Pelicans; in both Sçopus and Balaeniceps the ankylosed part is carinate below (Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. iv. plate 65, fig. 1, pal.). “The maxillo-palatines are large and spongy. The angle of the mandible is truncated,” except in Platalea and Ibis. The vomer is smallish and cultrate in Ciconia nigra; larger by far, cultrate, and pedate at the end in Thresciornis aethwpicus ; as large in Platalea leucorodia, but pointed in front and carinate below. Even in the last of these forms, in a half-grown individual, no sign of a median suture was seen. The vomer of Scopus is sharply cultrate above and rounded below; it reaches beyond the maxillo-palatine mass. In Balaeniceps (op. cit., p. 308, plate 65, fig. 1, v.) the vomer is like that of Scopus and Ciconia, but it is actually smaller than either. In most of these Ciconian and Ibidine types^[23. Balaeniceps has the head of a Stork, but its body is largely Ardeine.] the vomer is evidently azygous, but in all the skulls of Ardeidae now before the writer, viz., one or two species of each of the following genera, Ardea, Botaurus, Nycticorax, Garzetta, Tigrisoma, the vomer is double, large, and charadrian.

In Ardea cinerea the vomer is coalesced behind with the long, elegant, bicarinate palatines, and in front runs its point inbetween the free retral lobes of the maxillo-palatines. The m oieties have each a rounded keel, and those keels run parallel at first and then run into each other in front; above, the two halves form a deep fossa, in which the sub-carinate parasphenoid glides. The edges of this trough are roughly tuberculated and turned over, like the rim of a cup; the primary suture between the halves is retained behind for half the length of the bone. In several Ardeidae an additional maxillary bone—the “post-maxillary ”—is formed behind the angle of the maxillary. It is small in Ardea garzetta and Botaurus stellaris, and of good size in Botaurus viridis and Nycticorax ardeola. This bone was first found by Mr Parker in the Emeu. In Tigrisoma leucolophum there is a pair of “interpalatines,” as in the Duck tribe. In the Pelagomorphae the charadrian type reaches its culmination; yet the most exquisite forms, such as the Egrets and smaller Bitterns, and the most gigantic, as the Adjutant, are evidently specializations of a type similar to the pluvialine Schizognathae.

4. The Dysporomorphae. ^[24. Dyspοrus a generic name applied to the Gannets by llliger.] — “The rostrum is long and pointed, and more or less curved; and the external nasal apertures are very small. There are no basi-pterygoid processes. The palate bones unite for a considerable distance behind the posterior nares, and send down a vertical crest at their junction. The maxillo-palatines are large and spongy. The angle of the mandible is truncated.”

The inferior crest of the combined palatines is largest in Pelecanus , above, in Phalacrocorax and Sula, this plate is grooved for the sphenoidal rostrum, but in the Pelican there arises a huge crest, and the rostrum of the sphenoid rises rapidly out of its way. Here the secondary palatine arch has the same habit as the primary trabecular arch—a modification constant in birds in the latter. All the parts in front of the very mobile cranio-facial hinge are molten together into one mass, and the nasal labyrinth is in its most aborted state.

In Phalacrocorax the perpendicular ethmoid is of small antero-posterior extent. There is no presphenoid, but merely a small V-shaped orbito-sphenoidal band of bone above the optic passage. The same structure is seen in Himantopus and Eurypyga. In the Cormorant an oblong ossicle lies on the commencement of the zygoma. It is large in P. carbo, and small in P. graculus. A still larger ossicle has heightened the zygoma in Sula alba. This is the “post-maxillary.” In Sula alba the basi-temporals are as little developed as in the Dromaidae, less than in any other Carinate bird. Behind each moiety there is a largo oval opening, not far in front of the occipital condyle; this exposes the loose diploë within. The small eustachian tubes open at a little distance from each other, in a wide shallow fossa, on the part where the three elements of the parasphenoid meet. In both the Pelican and the Cormorant there is an elegant, crescentic, lipped, free margin to the very Ardeine basi-temporal plate. In Sula alba the columella auris is very long and bent. It has a small cartilaginous extra-supra-stapedial process, and a long attenuated cartilaginous infra-stapedial, terminated by a bony fusiform stylo-hyal. The hinge for the mandible is very far back in Sula, whose cranio-facial hinge almost rivals that of the Parrot and Toucan. In the Cormorant the mandibular articulation is almost carried as far back as in the Crocodile. In Sula alba the zygoma is very thick in front, and is suddenly reduced to an extremely thin bar, where it passes into the upper beak.

5. The Aetomorphae. — il The rostrum is more or less-arched and hooked at the tip. Basi-pterygoid processes· may be present or absent. The maxillo-palatine processes may be concavo-convex lamellae, or may be spongy and fill up the base of the rostrum; but they are always [except in Dicholop>hus, a genus which the writer adds to the group] united with an ossification of the septum. The breadth of the articular surface at the distal end of the quadrate bone is greater than its length, the outer condyle extending about as far downwards as the inner.”' This is best seen in the Cariama (Dicholophus), and in the Owls, Hawks, and Falcons; in the larger Old World Vultures (e.g., Gyps fulvus) it is not so well seen. “The angle of the mandible is never recurved.” At pp. 441 and 442 op. cit. it is stated that “the maxillo-palatines unite with one another and with the extremity of an ossified septum, so as to fill up the maxillo-palátine valley.” In the carefully prepared specimens before the writer, it is found that there is a space between the right and left maxillo-palatine, not only in the Cathartidae, where it is evident, but also in Gypogeraηus, where it is least. Intermediate between these types come the Old World Vultures and the Eagles. The skulls at hand give the following results, viz. :—

α. Perfect indirect Desmognathisnι.

Sarcοrhamphus papa, Aquila (sp. pl., including ∏elοtarsus ecaudatus), Gyps fulvus, Neophron percnopterus, Asio otus, Asio accipitrinus, Aluco flammeus, Kctupa ceylonica, Athene noctua, Strix stridula. Èlanus caerulcus. b. Imperfect direct Desmognathisιn.

Dicholophus cristatus. c. Perfect direct Desmognathism.

Falco peregrinus, Falco tinnuncuaιs, xalco aesalon, Accipiter nisus, Butco vulgaris, Circus cyaneus, Ηaliastur indus.

With regard to the basi-pterygoid processes, they are most aborted in Hicholoρhus, Helotarsus, and Gyps. They reappear as aborted prickles or knobs in some Eagles, in Neophron, Elanus, Circus, and Accipiter, and in the young: of these they are rather large. In Haliastur indus they are large, rounded flaps, with no cartilage on their end. Then come Gypogeraηus, the Cathartidae, and the Owls, in which they are constant. In all the Owls, as in Pigeons and some of the Turniddae (see Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. v. plate 34, fig. 2, m.o.f.), the slow growth of the occipital region of the chondro-cranium leaves a membranous space over the foramen magnum. This is not, or is very rarely [9:3:714] filled up by even the bony growths; it remains as the “median occipital fontanelle.”

The vomer in this group is of great interest, being extremely variable, and often having a supplementary bone attached. It is azygous. The palatines also, which have rounded posterior angles and double keels, often have a medio-palatine where they unite, and also receive the meso-pterygoid spur. In some types, as Gyps fulvus, the large rounded palatine flap is partly severed off as a “transpalatine.” Where the ascending laminae of the palatines meet below the sphenoidal rostrum, there a bony deposit takes place; this, if truly azygous, is a medio-palatine; if oblique, it is one of the meso-pterygoids, which, in the Rapaces, get between the palatines, coalesce· with each other, and form a keystone, as in Ulula stridula. In others, as the young of Falco tinnunculus and the adult Helotarsus ecaudatus, there is one small, obliquely-placed ossicle in the front of the palatine suture. In Neophron percnop*erus there is one free meso-pterygoid attached to the right hinder fork of the vomer. In Diehplophus cristatus there is a large medio-palatine wedged in in front, and to it the cultrate, fenestrate, and pedate vomer is attached. In the Falcons the vomer is pedate, and, in the larger kinds, fenestrate. In Ulula stridula there is a small vomer attached to a small medio-palatine, and having over it an equally small median septo-maxillary. The latter bone is large in Asio otus, and small in Neophron percηopterus, Circus cyaneus, and Haliastur indus. The vomer is most aborted in the Eagles and Vultures (often absent); but it is long in Neophron. We have found a small bony wedge (oblique meso-pterygoid) in Sarcorhamphus papa. Professor Huxley’s figure of the skull of Gypogeraηus is deficient in not showing a small vomer (fig. 24, p. 442). A specimen sent to him by the writer (after the paper appeared) has this little bone distinct. The frowning brow is obtained in these birds by a huge super-orbital process of the lachrymal in Dicholophus, Gyps, and Falco. In many kinds (Hawks, &c.) there is a distinct superorbital at its extremity. The eyeball, with its massive bony rim, is quite equal in Diehplophus to that of the diurnal Rapaces generally. Its hyoid also is thoroughly Raptorial. Its glossal (double) piece is spatulate, and, like that of its congeners, approaches the glosso-hyal of the Parrots in breadth. Unlike its congeners, the Cariama has its nasal septum but little ossified; and it possesses an “os uncinatum,” propping up the para plana, as in the Gull, Albatross, and many other birds.

A description of the palate of the Sparrow-Hawk (A ccipiter nisus, will illustrate that of Raptorial birds generally, and also the meaning of the term desmogηathous ^[25. See Monthly Microscopical Journal, Feb. 7, 1873, p. 45, plate 5, ⅛∙ 2. A paper by the same writer in the Linnean Transactions, 1875, may be consulted, for copious illustrations of the Desrnoynathw.] f The specimen figured (fig. 25) was a half-developed nestling. Its round occipital condyle, and the various foramina (8, 9), are shown in the occipital region, and outside and above this arch are seen the hinder face of the opisthotic (qp.), and in front of the tympanic ala of the exoccipital (e.o.) there is an uncinate bone in relation with the prootic, opisthotic, squamosal, and exoccipital, where they all meet together. This is the “pterotic” (ρto.), a huge bone in Osseous Fishes, and walling-in much of the labyrinth. In Serpents only a film of ectosteal bone represents it, and in Lizards such a plate appears, overlapping cartilage which has begun to calcify. It develops and becomes part of the parotic process. The basi-temporal plate (δ.i.), the rostrum, with its arrested basi-pterygoids (b.pg.), are shown, and on each side the double condyle of the quadrate (i∙), characteristically placed transversely. The zygoma is composed of thin needles of bone (qj., j.); the zygomatic process of the maxillary is, behind, bound up with the jugal and quadrato-jugal, and in front passes into the upper dentary region, half overlapped by the dentary process of the premaxillary (px.) The dentary edge of the maxillary sends inwards the maxillo-palatine plate (mx.p.), which meets its fellow at the mid-line, and also grows retrally and superiorly into an elegant shell-like mass.

The right and left plates lie edge to edge, as in the adult Cariama, and are imperfectly direct in their desmognathism. The palatine processes of the premaxillaries bind the fore-ends of the palatines, which in turn bind under the maxillo-palatine plates. The gap in front is filled with the fast ossifying septum nasi; it is pedate in front, and behind sends out a process on each side; these spurs ankylose afterwards with the maxillo-palatine plates, and they with each other. The palatine bones (pα.), straplike, widen backwards, and then gently narrow to the end, leaving no sharp postero-external angle. The wedge of bone which has been fretted off from the fore-end of each of the rod-like pterygoids (pg.) binds on the postero-superior edge of each palatine, and the inner plate of these bones covering the under surface of the sphenoidal rostrum imperfectly, allows part of these bony wedges—the “meso-pterygoids” (m. pg.)— to be seen from below. The bird has all the periotic bony centres, yiz.,fiνe, as in Osseous Fishes; it has distinct cartilaginous orbital alae, which are, like the presphenoid, separately ossified, besides an azygous ossification in membrane belonging to the same category.

6. The Psittacomorphoe. — The uniformity of this group of Desmognathoe is as remarkable as the variability of the last, and yet it is potent in genera and species. “The rostrum (see op. cit., p. 465) is arched and hooked at the extremity, and is regularly articulated with the frontal region of the skull.” Therefore we find that the craniofacial cleft is complete—a state of things not often occurring. The development of this type has not been observed, yet we can interpret the metamorphic results by other [9:3:715] types. “Basi-pterygoid processes [and vomers] are wanting. The palatines are vertically elongated posteriorly, while anteriorly they are horizontally flattened, and movably united with the rostrum. The maxillo-palatines are spongy. The lachrymal and post-orbital bend towards one another, and frequently unite below the orbit.” This is by the intervention of a large “03 uncinatum,” which is best seen in small types, such as Psephotis multicolor, and Agapσmis pullaria, where this part does not unite with the post-frontal. In Mixroglossa, Calyptorhynchus, Plyctolophus, Melopsittacus, &c., the temporal fossa is also bridged over by junction of the zygomatic process of the squamosal with the os uncinatum. “The orbital process of the quadrate bone is very small, and its distal presents only one facet (which is compressed from side to side, and convex from before backwards) for the mandible. The rami of the latter are deep, and pass into one another by a rounded symphysis.” The glosso-hyal is spatulate, and the basi-hyal is alate behind. In the fore-face are some things worth noting. The septum nasi is a thick wall of bone; the alae nasi are soft in Psephotis multicolor; they have an annular ossicle found in them in Melopsittacus undulatus; whilst in Paloeornis torquata this part is largely ossified and ankylosed to the upper jaw, and the alinasal turbinal is partly calcified. In one small kind we saw the trace of a small medio-palatine. The pars plana is narrow and ossified, and is ankylosed to the lachrymal; the inferior turbinal is soft.

7. The Coccygomorphoe. — This is another polymorphic group, and is not in any sense, either zoologically or morphologically, the equivalent of the last. Yet it is almost impossible to separate the families by auy character of importance. If the Podargus must be linked with the Kingfisher, the Goatsucker and its allies cannot be re moved, notwithstanding their schizognathous palate. Here, however, we are dealing with the desmognathous forms. Professor Huxley makes four sub-groups, and then remarks (p. 467): “It appears to me not improbable that it may hereafter be desirable to divide this group into four.” The characters of the skull are thus given (p. 466): “The rostrum presents very various forms, and may be movably articulated with the skull. Basi-pterygoid processes are present in only one genus (Trogon)f ^[26. For a figure of this skull, see Professor Reinhardt’s paper on the “Os uncinatum” (“Om en hidtil ukjendt Knogle i Hovedshallen hos Turakoerne Μιιsορhαgidxs, Sundev,” Saertryk af ll Videηskabdιge MeddxleL·er fra den Νaturhistοriske Fοrening i Kjobenhamf 1871). In this paper figures are given of the skull of Corythaix, Μusophaga, Schizorhis, and Τrogon.] l

The Oil-bird {Steatornis campensis) has very large basi-pterygoids, thus connecting the Goatsuckers with Podargus. “The maxillo-palatines are usually more or less spongy. The palatines are not developed into vertical plates, but are, as usual, horizontally flattened. The distal end of the quadrate has the ordinary form.” The vomer is small in Hornbills, Toucans, and Scythrops; but they have a second bone in front of the azygous vomer, viz., the “median septo-maxillary,” as in the Goose tribe and others. In Podargus, when the lower palatine floor—like that of a Mammal—is cut away, there are to be seen three small ossicles; the first of these is the vomer, the others are medio-palatines. In Megaloema the vomer is very large and forked in front. In the Kingfishers and Hoopoes there is no vomer; there is a trace in Corythaix. The palatines may be rounded behind as in Cuculus and Buceros, have a retral spur to the transpalatine part as in Rlιamphastos Alcedo, and Upupa, or be very broad, with a large passerine transpalatine angle, as in Podargus. See Professor Huxley’s figures, those of Μ. Reinhardt just referred to, and Dr Murie’s valuable papers “On the Skeleton of Todus,” Proc.

See also Murie “On Fregilupus,” Proc. Zool. Soc., June 16, 1874, plates 61. 62.] ? It is worth while to remember that these types are actually the highest, the most metamorphosed, and the most specialized; not so high in some respects as the Mammal, yet no Mammal comes near them in adaptive modification, not even the one which has the taste to admire, and the wit to describe them. We learn from no less an authority than Mr G. R. Gray that of the 10,000 known birds half belong to this group; the Old World types of which, more especially, are such accomplished creatures. The Nectarinia is the smallest, and the Raven the largest of this huge, but morphologically very uniform, group.

The skull of a fledgling Rook (fig 26) illustrates the highest bird of this type; the occipital condyle (o.c.) is hemispherical, the basitemporal plate (δ.i.) is an almost transverse band of bone, the rostrum of the parasphenoid (pα.s.) is without any developed basi-pterygoids, the craniofacial hinge is nearly perfect, but the nasals and nasal processes of the premaxillaries are thin splints set into the frontale; they do not form a perfect hinge.

The palatines are developed into cartilage at their hinder angle; this is a large flap, and, ossifying late and separately, has time to become chondrified first {t.pa.)∙, the pterygoids {pg.) are phalangiform, and lose their meso-pterygoid spur, which soon coalesces with the palatines. The maxillo-palatine processes are hooked and flattened, and often enlarged at their inner extremity, so as to become pneumatic.

But the distinguishing character of the type is the union [9:3:716] of the vomers with the alinasal wall and turbinal, and the possession, by the embryo bird at least, of a pair of “upper labials,” corresponding to the inner upper pair in Snakes, Sharks, and Skate; the vomers are either partial or entire ossification of these cartilages. Besides these, there reappear in most of the Aegithognathae the so-called “inferior turbinals,” or nostril-bones of the Snake and Lizard, and these are attached to the shoulders of the double, and generally, ox-face-shaped vomer.^[29. There is not space here to give illustration of all these details; but papers by Mr Parker are now (1875) appearing in the Transactions of theLinnean and Zoological Societies, in which these structures are copiously illustrated.] The nasal labyrinth is very large in the Rook, but does not differ in essentials from that of the Fowl, above described.

The septum nasi (s.nf retains much of its original flatness below, and is thus alate ; the vomer (v.) of the young bird is broad and grooved above; in the old bird, ossification running some distance along the alinasal wall and alinasal turbinal (n.tb.), the bone becomes not only emarginate, but also very massive in front. In the Lark (Alauda arvensis') this bony matter in the macerated skull leaves huge goat-horn processes to the fore-angles of the vomer. Aegithognathism occurs in different degrees; thus, we may have its morphological conditions—
[table]

a. Incomplete. Here the large “labials” are imperfectly ossified by the two vomers, and these bones are only strongly attached to the nasal labyrinth by fibrous tissue.

b. Complete var. l. In these cases the labials are often only imperfectly ossified by the vomerine centres; these centres also are distinct from those ossifying the alinasal cartilages; but the union of these parts is perfect.

c. Complete var. 2. In these cases the labials are often small and completely ossified by the vomers; but the bony deposit runs riot into the alinasal wall and turbinal, so that in the adult all distinction of the parts may be lost.

d. Compound. Here the flat arcuate end of the maxillo-palatine is free, but the mass of that plate meets its fellow of the opposite side and coalesces with it, and with a highly ossified nasal septum. In these Southern types the “transpalatine” is a long spike, as in the Alcedidae. In all these varieties the septo-maxillaries may, and do mostly, occur. They cannot always be found.^[30. Professor Huxley (op. cit., p. 472) was as unfortunate in his specimen of Menura as in that of Trochilus (see p. 468, where these birds are said to have their vomer truncated, whereas it is spiked} ; for in Mr Garrod’s specimens of the Lyre-bird’s skulls the maxillo palatines are large bony plates, like those of ordinary Coracomorphae The vomer of Menura is exactly like that of the Chough ( Frcgilus graculus), and also of many young Coracomorphae, for the two moieties do not necessarily form a re-entering angle or notch in front; that is often largely due to the osseous growth creeping into the alinasal cartilages. Λfenura has one character of great importance, viz., it retains the super-orbital chain of ossicles, like Psophia and the Tinamidae.]

Concluding our remarks upon this morphological type, its value is shown by this—that it is exactly superimposable upon the Coracomorphae, if we reject the bird that shows its initial or imperfect condition, as the Hemipod, and stubbornly hold to the popular view that Swifts are a kind of Swallow—for as to their nobler part, their head, they are merely a variety of that type. Thus the zoologist and the morphologist may here join hands.

The Saurognathous Type — Cranium of the Picus Minor.—This group, Professor Huxley’s Celeomorphae (op. cit. 448 and 467), is so remarkable and difficult of determination, that although our author saw clearly many most important characters (quite sufficient for the elimination of this group from the Coccygomorphae), yet the materials at hand were not sufficient for a perfect account of this type of skull. A fellow-worker has had fuller opportunities.^[31. See Mr Parker’s paper “On the Picidae," in the Linnean Transact tions, 1875, series 2, vol. i. plates 1-5.] Like the Parrots, these birds form a relatively small and neat group; the most outlying forms are Picumnus and Yunx, but these form no obstruction to their classification. Mr Parker’s proposed morphological term for these birds is Saurognathae, and the two terms can be superimposed, Celeomorphae being their zoological name. Professor Huxley saw that these birds were not desmognathous; that their vomerine moieties remained distinct; that their maxillo-palatines are but little developed; and that supernumerary bones on the inner edge of the palatines in Picus minor corresponded to the curious bars that are seen in the larger kinds. He also, with quick insight, says that their palate exhibits a “degradation and simplification of the Aegithognathous structure.” This is strictly true; the elementary parts are the same, but in the Woodpeckers they retain a very Reptilian distinctness, and even arrest of growth. Yet w ith that arrest there is combined a modification and metamorphosis of certain parts, such as is undergone by no other type. They are in some respects the most simple and embryonic, and in others the most highly specialized birds in the whole class. Their basi-pterygoids are arrested; their basi-temporal region large and wide. Two or three tympanies on each side help to form their remarkable cowrie-shaped ear-drum, which is mainly built up by the basi-temporals and exoccipitals. The lower end of the quadrate has the usual form: the bone itself is short; the pterygoids are long, slender, angular, and forked; the lower and foremost fork is the meso-pterygoid element, which does not become segmented off, and thus their pterygoids answer to that of a Snake or Lizard, and reach to the vomer.^[32. See Günther “On Hattenaf Phil. Trans., 1867, plate J, fig 2, P∙∙ ...]

The palatines (fig. 27, paf) have their postero-external [9:3:717] angle either rounded or obtuse-angled. The post-palatine region is bevelled off remarkably; but in Picummιs minutus, the lips of this part are greatly developed, as in the lower Passerines of South America;^[33. See Parker “On Aegithognathoe," part i., Zool. Trans., 1875, plates 54-62.] but in them this marked region appears to be always ossified directly from the main bone, whilst in Picumnus it is a separate ossification—a perfectly unique thing, as far as the writer’s knowledge goes. The broad main part of the palatine suddenly narrows at its first third, the remaining two-thirds being the long splintery prepalatine, opposite the beginning of which the inner lip runs into an “inter-palatine” spike (i,pα.) The ethmo-palatine processes are extremely long in the nestling of Yunx, and very short in that of Picus minor (e.paf They are the free anterior ends of that ascending plate which lies under the parasphenoidal rostrum. These plates are united by a cartilaginous commissure, daggershaped, which ossifies as the most marked medio-palatine (m.ρa.) seen in the class. The prepalatine band passes between the dentary and palatine spurs of the premaxillary (px.), as in the adult fowl. Oddly enough, they run on the inner side of the palatal process of the premaxillary in most of the Aegithognathoe. This is an after-modification, for in the young of Struthio camelus and Gallus domesticus the fore-end of the one and the hinder end of the other process are broad, and the two unite by suture. In the higher birds the processes overlap on either side, but orderly as to natural groups. The free end of the premaxillary palatine process looks backward to the free inter-palatine spur in the young (fig. 27); but in old birds, as may well be seen in Gecinus viridis, Picus analis, and P. major, these parts are formed into delicate bridges of bone, which also are thrown along to the ethmo-palatines. This is done by the vomerine series. The “septo-maxillaries * are not single conchoidal plates of bone, as in the Snake and Lizard; but are broken up into grains, which melt into each other again. Even the vomer itself is double on each side in Gecinus viridis, whilst in Hemilophus fulvus there are three septo-maxillaries on the left side and five on the right. These ossicles lie on the inner side of the palatines, and are normally connected behind by means of the vomer to the ethmo-palatine; where normal ornithic ankylosis takes place in adult birds, there these curious length-wise bridges are formed. Yet this is only part of their complexity, for median septo-maxillaries appear, two of them in Gecinus, and these are found in the substance of long, right and left, labial cartilages. These do not ossify in IIemilophus, but unite at the mid-line; in Gecinus they overlap largely to gain the mid-line. In the same species, to add to the complexity, a large shell of bone, from the inturned alinasal wall, becomes more or less free of its own origin, and unites to the vomerine series. All this has been seen and explained by writing and by figures.^[34. Ibid., “On the Picidoe," op. cit.]

The maxillo-palatine processes scarcely grow inwards at all in Picumnus ; in Yunx they are rather larger; larger still in Picus minor (fig. 27, mx.p.) Where they are largest, as in Gecinus, they just rest upon the outer edge of the palatines, covering nearly half their width. In all, the under face of the maxillary has an open pneumatic space at this part. But, as if to fill up that which was wanting, a separate palatine plate appears on the inner edge of the maxillary further forward, only on the left side, however (fig. 27, p.mχj) This is a semi-oval wedge of bone, and has its symmetrical counterparts in several families of the Coracomorphoe, viz., Emberiza, Cardinalis, &c.

These birds are saurognathous in other respects, e.g., their nasal labyrinth is unusually simple. The “inferior turbinal,” which has three coils in Rhea and Tinamus, and two in most birds, is in Gecinus merely bi-alate; in Yunx it makes less than a single turn, whilst the alinasal turbinal of that bird has two turns, and that of Gecinus one. Gecinus is in all respects the most specialized, Picumnus the most embryonic,and Yunx the most passerine of the Celeomorphoe. Also, in Gecinus the nasal labyrinth is most ossified, and in Yunx least. In Gecinus the “columella auris” has two supra-stapedial spurs and two infra-stapedial bands, which have united with the tongueshaped stylo-hyal: this has in it a bony centre. The small cerato-hyals early coalesce into one arrowheadshaped bone, and then comes a very long, highly ossified, and elastic basi-hyal, with no uro-hyal behind it. Joined to this are a pair of lower thyro-hyals, half its length; but the upper pieces are four times the length of the lower, and they, passing first down the sides of the upper part of the neck, again turn gently upwards and forwards, ploughing themselves a furrow on the skull top, and deflecting gently to the right nasal roof, wnere they end.

All these things being considered, it will seem contradictory now to assert the great uniformity of the skulls of Birds, and indeed of the Birds themselves. Yet so it is; and the countless modifications that offer themselves for observation are gentle in the extreme. One form often is seen to pass into another by almost insensible gradations. One thing is certain, namely, that an anatomist not familiar with this class, and coming to its study fresh from the Reptiles, would find himself at fault at every turn; for he would see changes altogether as great as if he had passed from the Helminthoid types, and from mere larvae and pupae of the Insects to the (to him supposably) unthought-of imagines that spring from those low and worm-like stages.

In the rest of the Birds’ organization abundant evidence of the same specialization will be seen. The mind fails to desire more beauty or to contemplate more exquisite adaptations. An almost infinite variety of Vertebrate life is to be found in this class. Of its members some dig and bury their germs, which rise again in full plumage, whilst others watch and incessantly feed their tender brood in the shady covert or “on the crags of the rock and the strong place.” In locomotion some walk, others run, or they may wade, swim, plunge, or dive, whilst most of them “fly in the open firmament of heaven.”

Every ornithologist will be grateful for that piece of work.]

The spinal column of birds contains numerous and well-ossified vertebrae, a considerable number of which (more than six) are ankylosed together to form a sacrum. Of the vertebrae which enter into the composition of this complex bone, however, not more than from three to five can be regarded as the homologues of the sacral vertebrae of a Crocodilian or Lacertilian Reptile. The rest are borrowed, in front, from the lumbar and dorsal regions; behind, [9:3:718] from the tail. The cervical region of the spine is always long; and its vertebrae, which are never fewer than eight, and may be as many as twenty-three, are, for the most part, large in proportion to those of the rest of the body.

The atlas is a relatively small, ring-like bone; and the transverse ligament may become ossified and divide its aperture into two—an upper for the spinal cord, and a lower for the odontoid process of the axis vertebra. The os odontoideum is always ankylosed with the second vertebra, and constitutes a peg-like odontoid process.

The spines of the succeeding cervical vertebrae are often obsolete, and are never very prominent in the middle region of the neck. The anterior faces of their elongated vertebral centra are convex from above downwards, and concave from side to side; whilst the posterior faces are cylindrical, slightly excavated from, above downwards, and convex from side to side. (The contrary of this is stated in Professor Huxley’s Verteb. Anim., p. 276, where the author, by a lapsus memoriae, puts it vice versa.) Hence, in vertical section the centra appear opisthocoelous ; in horizontal section, procoelous, and not the contrary, as is stated by our author; and the structure is exceedingly characteristic of birds. The under surfaces of the centra frequently give off median inferior processes. In the Ratitoe it is obvious that the cervical vertebrae have short transverse processes and ribs, disposed very much as in the Crocodilia. For, in young birds, the anterior end of the lateral face of each vertebra bears two small processes, an upper and a lower; and this expanded head of a styliform rib is articulated with these by two facets, which represent the capitulum and the tuberculum (Huxley, op. cit., p. 276). In the chicken of the Emeu (Dromoeus novoe-hollandioe) the writer, in 1843, carefully worked out and figured these parts. Of the twenty cervical vertebrae only the atlas and axis were devoid of distinct ribs; this individual was six weeks old. These riblets were bony wedges, with a sharp point; but that was free, and the thick upper end was jammed in between upper and lower transverse processes (diapophysis and parapophy sis). The last but one of the ribs became suddenly larger, and the last was two-thirds the size of its successor—the first dorsal. Then followed six large ribs on each side, the last two floating. The vertebra bearing the last of these, and twenty more, are closely embraced by the fore-and-aft growth of the ilium, and form the so-called sacrum. Of the twenty vertebrae between the first overlapped bone with a floating rib and the nine ribless caudals, there are five with free ribs, small, and hatchet-shaped, quite like those in the neck of the Crocodile. These, from being attached to a parapophysial cup near the fore-end of the centrum, get more forward, and wedge in between their own vertebra and the one in front. The next four vertebrae, which give exit to the sacral plexus (or at least to most of it), have no ribs, and are very broad and short. They develop lamellar upper transverse processes, but theiι spines are aborted. Then come eleven vertebrae, in front of the free caudal, that have short ribs; the first two pairs are ankylosed already, then four pairs are distinct, and the remaining five have their ribs ankylosed, and then becoming shorter and more pedate externally, get further backwards on the centrum. Thus, in a Bird as old as six weeks after hatching, there are eighteen pairs of cervical, and nine pairs of so-called sacral ribs still distinct. Moreover, the ribs are quite aborted on the first and second cervical, on the four true sacral,—perchance, the next after this is also sacral,—and on all the caudal vertebrae which have only papilliform transverso processes. There are fifty-five vertebrae in all in the Emeu, thus :—cervical, twenty; dorsal, five; dorso-lumbar (the first with a large rib and really the sixth dorsal), six; sacral (proper), four; uro-sacral, eleven; caudal, nine. We shall return to these data in describing the sacrum of the Fowl.

With age the cervical ribs (of the Ratitoe) may become completely ankylosed. In Apteryx australis one, below, remains free; in Struthio camelus, two; and in Dromoeus novoe-hollandioe, three; and then they appear like transverse processes, perforated at the base by a canal, which, as in the Crocodilia, contains the vertebral artery and vein, and the main trunk of the sympathetic nerve. The cervical ribs and transverse processes are similarly disposed in very young Carinatae; but in these birds their form frequently becomes much modified in the adult, and they develop prolongations which extend downwards and inwards, and protect the carotid artery or arteries. The neural arches have well-developed pre-and post-zygapophyses. The ribs of one or two of the posterior cervical vertebrae become elongated and freely movable in the Carinatae, as in the Ratitoe.

The first dorsal vertebra is defined as such by the union of the ribs with the sternum by means of a sternal rib, which not only, as in the Crocodilia, becomes articulated with the vertebral rib, but is converted into complete bone, and is connected by a true articulation with the margin of the sternum. The number of the dorsal vertebrae (reckoning under that head all the vertebrae, after the first dorsal, which possess distinct ribs, whether they be fixed or free) varies. The centra of the dorsal vertebrae either possess cylindroidal articular faces, like those of the neck, as is usually the case; or more or fewer of them may have their faces spheroidal, as in the Penguins [Plovers (and their kin Vanellus cristatus, Totanus fuscus, <fcc.), Gulls, Cormorants, and Parrots], In this case the convex face is anterior, the concave, posterior. They may, or may not, develop .inferior median processes [which may be simple, as in the Cormorant, where they exist on several lower cervical, on all the dorsal, and in five sacro-lumbar; or they may bifurcate into two broad, bony leaves, as in Colymbus]. They usually possess well-marked spinous processes [which begin in the two or three lower cervicals]. Sometimes they are slightly movable upon one another [bound strongly, in many cases, by ossified tendons of great strength and elasticity]; sometimes they become ankylosed together into a solid mass. [When this takes place the last cervical is ankylosed to the three first dorsal, as in the fowl, the fourth remaining free, and the fifth coalescing with the lumbar; or, as many as five may ankylose together, leaving one free, and the last ankylosed to the lumbar, as in Falco cesalon. But this number often differs with age, as may be seen in different individuals of Psophia crepitans, and other, more typical, Cranes.]

It is characteristic of the dorsal vertebrae of Birds that the posterior, no less than the anterior, vertebrae present a facet or small process on the body, or lover part of the arch, of the vertebra for the capitulum of the rib, while the upper part of the neural arch gives off a more elongated process for the tuberculum. Thus, the transverse processes of all the dorsal vertebrae of a Bird resemble those of the two anterior dorsals of a Crocodile, and no part of the vertebral column of a Bird presents transverse processes with a step for the head of the rib. like those of the [9:3:719] great majority of the vertebrae of Crocodιlιa, Dιιιosaurιa, Dicyuodoutia, and Pterosauria. [The triangular facets for the tubercular processes are scarcely scooped; those for the capitular are neat, round, shallow cups.] The discrimination of the proper lumbar, sacral, and anterior caudal vertebrae, in the ankylosed mass which constitutes the so-called “sacrum” of the Bird, is a matter of considerable difficulty. The general arrangement is as follows :—The most anterior lumbar vertebra has a broad transverse process, which corresponds in form and position with the tubercular transverse process of the last dorsal. In the succeeding lumbar vertebrae the process extends downwards; and in the hindermost [the third] it is continued from the centrum, as well as from the arch of the vertebra, and forme a broad mass which abuts against the ilium.^[36. It would be more proper to say that ossification extends into and from the centrum as well as from the neural arch. The process, like other processes, exists before the centrum is differentiated from the arch by ossification (Huxley).] This process might well be taken for a sacral rib, and ,its vertebra for a proper sacral vertebra. But, in the first place, I find no distinct ossification in it [there are five of these lumbar vertebra in the Emeu, two more than in the Fowl, and they all have distinct ribs; and the ribless vertebrae are five in the Fowl and four in the Emeu]; and, secondly, the nerves which issue from the intervertebral foramina in front of and behind the vertebra enter into the lumbar plexus, which gives origin to the crural and obturator nerves, and not into the sacral plexus, which is the product of the nerves which issue from the intervertebral foramina of the proper sacral vertebrae in other Vertebrata. Behind the last lumbar vertebra follow, at most, five vertebrae which have no ribs; but their arches give off horizontal, lamellar processes, which unite with the ilia. [In the Emeu these four vertebrae show not the least trace of ribs, and are flat bricks of bone, below, jammed together like the cervical centra of a Cetacean.] The nerves which issue from the intervertebral foramina of these vertebrae unite to form the sacral plexus, whence the great sciatic nerve is given off; and I [Professor Huxley] take them to be the homologues of the sacral vertebrae of the Reptilia. The deep fossae between the centra of these vertebrae, their transverse processes, and the ilia, are occupied by the middle lobes of the kidneys. If these be the true sacral vertebrae, it follows that their successors are anterior caudal. They have expanded upper transverse processes, like the proper sacral vertebrae; but, in addition, three or four of the most anterior of these vertebrae possess ribs, which, like the proper sacral ribs of Reptiles, are suturally united, or ankylosed proximally, with both the neural arches and the centra of these vertebrae; while, distally, they expand and abut against the ilium. The ankylosed caudal vertebrae may be distinguished as uro-sacral.

We now give a table showing the number of bones in the so-called sacrum of Birds—so many vertebrae as are covered by the ilia and ankylosed together. Here the distinction between dorsal and lumbar is, that the former p03se33 elongated ribs; and the table will show forms of extreme length and of extreme shortness, for a Bird; and also, as in the Fowl, of a medium type. Most of the instances are derived from the sacral bones of young Birds.
[table]

In both the Hoopoe and the Swift the first of these sacrais has an outstanding rib-process. In the Swift the rib on the second of the enclosed dorsals is very long, and its flanking rib nearly reaches the sternum. The next or third vertebra, the lumbar, has below it, neither reaching to it above, nor by its sternal piece to the sternum below, another rib; it is two-thirds the size of its predecessor, and only occurs on the right side. This will show how, by gradations the most gentle, the vertebrae and their ribs are specialized in each particular type, and also how very arbitrary is our nomenclature.

The Swan has eight free vertebrae behind the uro-sacral, and as the last of these is in these types composed of ten vertebrae originally, there are primarily twenty-seven vertebrae in the Swan’s tail. The caudal vertebrae which succeed the uro-sacral may be numerous and all distinct from one another, as in Archaeopteryx, or few and distinct, as in Rhea; but more generally, only the anterior caudal vertebrae are distinct and movable, the rest being ankylosed into a ploughshare-shaped bone or pygostyle, which supports the tail feathers and the uropygial gland, and sometimes, as in the Woodpecker and some other Birds expands below into a broad polygonal disk.

The centra of the movable presacral vertebrae of Birds are connected together by fibro-cartilaginous rings, which extend from the circumference of one to that of the next. Each ring is continued inwards into a disk, with free anterior and posterior faces—the meniscus. The meniscus thins towards its centre, which is always perforated. The synovial space between any two centra is, therefore, divided by the meniscus into two very narrow chambers, which communicate by the aperture of the meniscus. Sometimes the meniscus is reduced to a rudiment; while, in other cases, it may be united, more or less extensively, with the faces of the centra of the vertebrae. In the caudal region the union is complete, and the meniscus altogether resembles an ordinary intervertebral cartilage.

A ligament traverses the centre of the aperture of the meniscus, and in the Duck contains the intervertebral portion of the notochord. As Jäger^[38. “Das Wirbelkörpergelenk der Vögel,” Sitzungsberichte der Wiener Akademie, 1858.] has shown, it is the homologue of the odontoid ligament in the cranio-spinal articulation, and of the pulpy central, part of the intervertebral fibro-cartilages in Mammalia. All the vertebral ribs in the dorsal region, except, perhaps, the very last free ribs, have widely separated capitula and tubercula. More or fewer have well-ossified uncinate processes attached to their posterior margins, as in the Crocodilia [and Hatteria. These are separate, both as cartilage and as bone, at first; we have only failed to find them in the Crested Screamer (Chauna chavaria}. Among the Ratitoe they are very small and few in number; in the Emeu and in the Apteryx they are large; they evidently correspond with the unsevered rib-flaps of the little Ant-eater (Parker’s ⅛houlder- [9:3:720] girdle and Sternum, plate 22, figs. 19, 20).j The vertebral ribs are completely ossified up to their junction with the sternal ribs.

The sternum in Birds is a broad plate of cartilage which is always more or less completely replaced in the adult by membrane bone.^[40. These statements do not apply to Archaeopteryx ; its structure is very imperfectly known (Huxley). "] It begins to ossify by, at fewest, two centres, one on each side, as in the Ratitoe. In the Carinatoe it usually begins to ossify by five centres, of which one is median for the keel, and two are in pairs for the lateral parts of the sternum. Thus the sternum of a Chicken is at one time separable into five distinct bones, of which the central keel-bearing ossification (fig. 30) is termed the lophosteon, the antero-lateral piece which articulates with the ribs, pleurosteon, and the postero-lateral bifurcated piece, metosteon.

[In Tur nix there are two more centres, mesiad of the pleurostea, these are the coracostea; in Dicholophus the median part suddenly dilates, behind, into a heart-shaped flap of cartilage, which has an endosteal patch, the urosteon.^ ∖

Though the sternum, in most Birds, seems to differ very much in form from that of the Reptilia, it is rhomboidal in the Casuariidoe, where it differs from the Reptilian sternum chiefly in the greater proportional length of its posterior sides, the absence of median backward prolongations, and the convexity of its ventral surface. But in other birds, and notably in many Carinatae, the antero-lateral edges, which are grooved to receive the coracoids, form a much more open angle than in the Reptilia, while the postero-lateral edges become parallel or diverge; and a wide, straight, or convex transverse edge takes the place of the posterior angle. Two, or four, membranous fontanelles may remain in the posterior moiety of the sternum when ossification takes place, and give rise to as many holes, or deep notches, separating slender processes in the dry skeleton. All these correspond with so many divisions of the xiphoid process of the sternum in Mammalia, and hence are called middle, internal, and external xiphoid processes. Sometimes a median process, rostrum or manubrium (figs. 30, 31), is developed from the anterior angle of the sternum, and its antero-lateral angles are developed into costal j>rocesses, which may bear the articular surfaces for more or fewer of the ribs. The two last-named structures are very distinct in the Coracomorphce, or Passerine Birds.

The extent to which the keel of the lophosteon is developed in the Carinate birds varies very much. In Strigops it is rudimentary; in birds of powerful flight, as well as in those which use their wings for swimming, it is exceedingly large.

The pectoral arch presents a long, narrow, and recurved scapula (fig. 32), without any supra-scapula, and a coracoid [9:3:721] (co.); fitted by its proximal end in the groove in the anterolateral edge of the sternum. The inner ends of the coracoids often overlap, as in Lacertilia ; otherwise the shoulder-girdle is unlike that of any of the Reptilia, except the Pterosauria. The coracoid is usually completely ossified, and presents no fontanelle. There is no distinct epicoracoid. The two bones take nearly equal shares in the formation of the glenoidal cavity, and usually remain unankylosed and distinct in this region.

In the Ratitae the long axis of that part of the scapula which lies near the glenoidal cavity is parallel or coincident with that of the coracoid, and the two bones become completely ankylosed. But in all the Carinatae the long axis of the scapula forms an acute, or only slightly obtuse angle [Ocydrom/us, Didus) with that of the coracoid. A small bone, the scapula accessoria, is developed on the outer side of the shoulder-joint in most Coracomorphae and Celeomorphae.

In the Carinatae the glenoidal end of the scapula is divided into two portions: a glenoidal process, which expands to form the upper part of the glenoidal cavity, and to unite with the coracoid; and an acromial process, which gives attachment to the outer end of the clavicle. The glenoidal end of the coracoid is in like manner divided into two portions: a glenoidal process, which unites with the scapula, and a clavicular process, which articulates with the outer surface of the clavicle near its outer end. The clavicular process of the coracoid does not represent the procoracoid of Lacertilia; rudiments of that bone unite with the clavicle. In the Ratitae there is no distinct clavicular process; but the anterior part of the coracoid, near the glenoid cavity, may be produced and separated by a notch or fontanelle from the rest, or developed down to the sternum (in Struthio) as a lacertilian procoracoid. There is no trace of clavicles in Apteryx, Rhea, Struthio, and some Parrots; but in the latter there is generally an ossified, distinct, short procoraoid. In the Emeu and in some Carinatae [Didus, R,hαmphastos toco, Corythaix buffoni, Bucβrοs albirostris), the clavicles remain distinct from one another, or connected only by fibrous tissue; but in the majority of Birds they are very early ankylosed together, and with the representative of the inter-clavicle, in the middle line, into a single bone, the furculum, the strength of which bears a pretty close relation to the exertion required of the wings in flight or in natation. In the Passerine Birds the scapular end of the clavicle is enlarged by a procoracoid rudiment of cartilage, which ossifies separately, producing the expansion above and in front called epicleüliurn.

A median process [hypocleιdium) is frequently developed from the inter-clavicular part of the furculum, and this may be united with the carina of the sternum by strong fibrous tissue, or even by continuous ossification. In Opisthocomus ^[41. Huxley “On the Αlcctοrcmοrphοεf p. 306, fige. 8 and 9.] the furculum is ankylosed with the manubrial part of the sternum on the one hand, and with the coracoids on the other. Ankylosis of the furculum with the coracoids has also been observed in Didus, ^[42. Owen “On the Dodo.” Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. vi. part 2, p. 63, plate 20, fig. 4.] and with both keel and coracoid in Fregata aquila [Shouldergirdle and Sternum, p l 5, 1; see also the actual specimen in the museum of Col. Surg. Eng.)

The fore-limb of a Bird, when in a state of rest (fig. 33), exhibits a great change of position, if it be compared with that of an ordinary Reptile; and the change is of a character similar to, but in some respects greater, than that which the arm of a man presents when compared with the fore-limb of a quadrupedal Mammal. The humerus lies parallel with the axis of the body, its proper ventral surface looking outwards. The fore-arm is in a position midway between pronation and supination, and the manus is bent back upon the ulnar side of the fore-arm in a position not of flexion but of abduction.

In ordinary Birds the proximal end of the humerus is expanded, and its articular head transversely elongated. Its ventral face is convex, and provided with a strong preaxial ridge, which gives attachment to the pectoral muscle. The proper dorsal face is concave from side to side, especially towards the postaxial margin, where the pneumatic aperture occurs in those birds which have the humerus hollow. The distal end is expanded, and the articular surface for the radius is a convex facet, directed obliquely inwards on its ventral face. In this respect the Bird’s humerus exaggerates a feature of that of the Lizard’s.

In the Ratitae these peculiarities are very feebly, or not at all, marked, the humerus being a slender, cylindrical, slightly-curved bone. In the Casuariidae, Dinornithidae, and Apterygidae, the fore-limb is extraordinarily reduced, and may become rudimentary. In the Penguins and, to [9:3:722] a less degree, in the Great Auk, the humerus becomes flattened from side to side, the proximal end is singularly modified, and at the narrow distal end the articular surface for the radius lies completely in front of, and rather above, that for the ulna.

The ulna, which often presents a series of tubercles, indicating the attachment of the secondary quill feathers, is usually a stronger and a longer bone than the radius. There are only two carpal bones, one radial and one ulnar. There is one exception to this, namely, in the Screamer (Chauna chavaria), which has three carpals on the left side, the lower arcuate bone having two representatives.

In the Apterygidoe and in the Casuariidae there is but one complete digit in the manus. It appears to answer to the second of the pentadactyle limb, and is provided with a claw. In the Struthionidoe and Rheidoe, and in all the Carinatae, there are three digits in the manus, which answer to the pollex and the second and third digits of the pentadactyle fore-limb; and the metacarpal bones of these digits are ankylosed together. As a rule the metacarpal of the pollex is much shorter than the other two; that of the second digit is strong and straight; that of the third is more slender and bowed, so as to leave an interspace between itself and the second, which is often filled up by bony matter. The pollex has two phalanges, and the second of them is, in many birds— Rhea, the Screamer, &c.—pointed, curved, and ensheathed in a horny claw. The second digit has two and sometimes three phalanges, as in the Swan; and the terminal phalanx is similarly provided with a claw in sundry birds, e.g., the Swan and Rhea. In the Ostrich both the pollex and the second digit are unguiculate. The third digit possesses one phalanx, besides its ankylosed metacarpal, and is always devoid of a claw.

It is a singular circumstance that the relative proportions of the humerus and the manus should present the most marked contrast in two groups of birds which are alike remarkable for their powers of flight. These are the Swifts and Humming-birds, in which the humerus is short and the manus long, and the Albatrosses, in which the humerus is long and the manus relatively short.

In the Penguins the pollex has two free phalanges, and its metacarpal bone (which is distinct in the young birds) ankyloses with that of the second digit. The third metacarpal is slender and straight. The bones of the manus are singularly elongated and flattened.

The pelvis of a Bird (fig. 34) is remarkable for the great elongation, both anteriorly and posteriorly, of the iliac bones (iZ.), which unite with the whole length of the edges of the sacrum, and even extend forwards over the posterior ribs of the dorsal region. Below, each iliac bone forms a wide arch over the acetabulum (am.), the centre of which is always closed by fibrous tissue, so that in the dry skeleton the bottom of the acetabulum is always perforated by a wide foramen. An articular surface on the ilium, on which the great trochanter of the femur plays, is called the antitrochanter. In all ordinary birds the ischium (is.), which broadens towards its hinder end, extends back nearly parallel with the hinder part of the ilium, and is united with it by ossification posteriorly. The ischiosciatic interval is thus converted into a foramen. The pubis (pb.) enters by its dorsal or acetabular end into the formation of the acetabulum, and then passes backwards and downwards as a comparatively slender, curved bone, nearly parallel with the ischium. It is united with its fellow only by fibrous tissue. Very few birds present any important variation from this structure of the pelvis. In Tinamus, ^[43. ι Parker, Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. v. plate 3S,] Casuarius, Dromoeus, Apteryx, Dinornis, the ischium is not united with the backward extension of the ilium by bone. In Rhea the ischia unite with one another beneath the vertebral column; and the vertebrae in this region, that is, from the true sacral to the end of the iliac roof, become undistinguishable, being formed into a long slender uro-sacral style. In Struthio alone, among Birds, do the pubes unite in a median ventral symphysis (see Mivart, T. Z. S., vol. i. part 7, pp. 434, 435, figs. 72, 73). Another not less remarkable circumstance in the Ostrich is that the 31st to the 35th vertebrae inclusively (counting from the atlas) develop five lateral tuberosities. The three middle tuberosities are large, and abut against the pubis and the ischium. In these vertebrae, as in the dorsal vertebrae of the Chelonia, the neural arch of each vertebra shifts forward, so that half its base articulates with the centrum of the next vertebra in front, and the tuberosities in question are outgrowths, partly of the neural arch, and partly of the juxtaposed vertebral centra between which it is wedged. Hence in young Ostriches the face of each tuberosity exhibits a triradiate suture. A small bone is sometimes found on the ventral edge of the pubis, at its middle; this has been supposed to represent a marsupial bone (Garrod, P. Z. S., Mar. 1872, p. 359).

The upper articular head of the femur is rounded, and its axis is almost at right angles with the body of the bone; a structure which is not found in ordinary Reptilia, but exists in the Iguanodon and other Ornithosce-lida. The shaft is relatively short and thick, and the two terminal condyles are large and elongated antero-posteriorly. A prominent ridge, which plays between the proximal ends of the tibia and fibula, is apparent upon the posterior and inferior surface of the outer condyle. A similar ridge is faintly developed in some Lacertilia, and is well marked in the Dinosaurian Reptiles. A patella is usually present, but it is sometimes absent, and may be double.

The fibula of Birds (fig. 36, F.) is always imperfect, [9:3:723] ending in a mere style below. Generally, it is decidedly shorter than the tibia, but it has the same length as that bone in some Penguins. The tibia (i.), or rather “tibio-tarsus,” is a highly characteristic bone. Its proximal end is expanded, and produced anteriorly, into a great cnemial process (which may be variously subdivided), as in Dinosauria. The distal end is terminated by a well-marked pulley-like articular surface, which is inclined somewhat forwards as well as downwards. Not unfrequently there is an oblique bar of bone on the anterior face, just above the pulley, beneath which the long extensor tendons pass.

The extremity of the cnemial process in Struthio, Rhea, and Dromoeus is ossified as an epiphysis; and in young birds the whole of the distal articular end of the bone is separated from the rest by a suture, and also appears tc be an epiphysis. But it is, in fact, as Professor Gegenbaur^[44. See “Archiv für Anat.,” in Phys. Jahrgang, 1863, and Huxley, on “Dinosaurs,” Q. Jour. Geol. Soc., Nov. 10, 1869.] has proved, the proximal division of the tarsus (apparently representing only the astragalus of the other Vertebrata), which exists in the embryo as a separate cartilage, and, as it ossifies, ankyloses with the tibia. The so-called tibia of a bird is therefore, properly speaking, a tibio-tarsus.

In all Birds, even in Archaeopteryx, the fifth digit of the pes remains undeveloped;^[45. In his earlier papers, Mr Parker mistook the bony core of the cock’s spur for the first, thus making the proper hallux the second toe.] and the second, third, and fourth metatarsals are ankylosed together, and by their proximal ends, with a bone, which is a distinct cartilage in the foetus, and represents the distal division of the tarsus. Thus a tarso-metatarsus is formed (fig. 37). The distal ends of the metatarsals remain separate, and offer convex articular surfaces to the proximal phalanges of the digits.

In the Penguins, large apertures lie between the several metatarsals of the adult tarso-metatarsus; and in other birds more or less considerable passages persist between the middle and lateral metatarsals proximally, and the middle and outer distally. In most birds the middle metatarsal does not remain parallel with the others, but its proximal end inclines a little backward, and its distal end a little forward. Hence the two apertures on each side of its proximal end may lie at the bottom of a fossa, or run into one in front, while they remain distinct behind.

Again, in most Birds the posterior face of the proximal end of the middle metatarsal, and the adjacent surface of the tarsal bone, grow out into a process which is commonly, but improperly, termed “calcaneal.” The inferior surface of this hypo-tarsus is sometimes simply flattened, sometimes traversed by grooves or canals for the flexor tendons of the digits.

When a hallux exists, its metatarsal bone is usually incomplete above, and is united to the ligament by the inner or the posterior surface of the tarso-metatarsus. In the Frigate-bird (Phaethon), and in Steatornis, the hallucal metatarsal is remarkably long. The genus Phaethon stands alone, as far as we know, in having the hallucal metatarsal ankylosed with the others.

In many of the Alectoromorphoe a spur (calcar), con sisting of a bony core ensheathed in horn, is developed on the inner side of the metatarsus, and becomes ankylosed with the metatarsal of the second digit; in some there are two spurs. In a few birds, similar spurs (Palamedea), or osseous excrescences (Pezophaps), are developed in relation with the metacarpus.

The normal number of the pedal phalanges in Birds is (as in ordinary Lacertilia) two, three, four, five, reckoning from the hallux to the fourth digit. Among the few Birds which constitute exceptions to the rule are the Swifts, in which the third and fourth toe have only three phalanges each (2, 3, 3, 3), and the Goatsuckers, in which the fourth toe only has the number reduced (2, 3, 4, 4)—not 2, 3, 4, 3, as Professor Huxley (op. α⅛.)puts it for Caprimulgus. Mr Parker has figured the fourth toe of the Sand-grouse (Syrrhaρtes') with only three, but he speaks (op. cit., p. 203) of only one as wanting in that toe.

Many Birds have only three toes by suppression of the hallux. In the Ostrich, not only the hallux, but the phalanges of the second digit, are suppressed, and the distal end of the second metatarsal is reduced to a mere [9:3:724] rudiment. Hence the Ostrich has only two toes (which answer to the third and fourth of the pentadactyle foot), with four phalanges in the inner and five in the outer, though the inner toe is far the longer and the stronger.

In most four-toed Birds the hallux is turned more or less completely backwards, and the other three digits forwards. But in many Aetomorphae (especially the Owls) the outer toe can be turned outwards, or even backwards, at will. And in the Parrots, Toucans, Cuckoos, Woodpeckers, and other so-called “Scansorial” Birds, the outer toe is permanently reversed. Under these circumstances the distal end of the outer metatarsal may be divided into two distinct articular surfaces. In the Trogons there are two toes in front and two behind, as in the Parrots; but it is the second toe which is turned backwards. Lastly, in the Swifts, the Dysporomorphoe, and the Spheniscomorphce, the hallux is directed more or less forwards, so that all four toes are turned to the front.

As a general rule, the osseous tissue of Birds is remarkably dense and hard. Before hatching, the bones are solid and filled with vascular medulla; but after birth, more or fewer of the bones are always excavated by prolongation of cavities containing air, which lie in their neighbourhood. Such air cavities are always found in the skull, in connection with rhe nasal and auditory passages, and they may extend through all parts of the skull, with the exception of the jugal arch, which, however, is pneumatic in the Toucan and Hornbill. In many birds, Apteryx, Penguin, Divers (and Gulls, according to Professor Huxley; but this is a mistake, their spinal column far into the sacrum is pneumatic; Larus canus shows this well), and the smaller Song-birds, no other bones than those of the skull are pneumatic; but in most birds the air-sacs of the lungs send prolongations into the bones of the rest of the trunkskeleton, seldom into the caudal vertebrae, as in Bal<εniceps, the Adjutant, Hornbill, &c. In the Hornbills the whole skeleton is pneumatic; in a large number of birds the humerus alone of the limb-bones contains air; in the diurnal Raptores, the femur also. It is proper to remark that the amount of pneumaticity of bones by no means follows the development of the powers of flight. In the Ostrich, for example, the bones are far more extensively pneumatic than in the Gull.

In some cases, prolongations of the air-sacs extend beneath the integument.

The Muscles.

In the space allotted to the writer, there is merely room for justice to be done to one category of organs; and as the skeleton, and especially the skull, is of most direct importance to the zoologist and palaeontologist, and as its form determines, as it were, all other organs, they being correlated with it and answering to it, it seemed to be that on which election should fall for the fuller treatment. An impartial description of all the systems of organs would have resulted in the merest outline for each. For the muscles, Professor Huxley’s abstract must serve.^[46. Anat. Vert. Anim., p. 300. For an almost exhaustive bibliography of writings on the muscular system of birds, see Μ. Edmond Alix’s Essai sur l' Appareil locomoteur des Oiseaux, pp. 367-373. This list begins with Aldrovandus, 1581, and ends withGoverod, 1873, 1874. We miss, however, Macgillivray’s excellent description, with figures, of the muscles of flight, Brit. Birds, vol. i. plate 3, pp. 35-46; and another by Professor Rolleston, “On Muscles connected with the Shoulder-joint,” Trans. Linn. Soc., vol. xxvi. pp. 610-629. See also Owen “On the Apteryx,” Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. vii. p. 381, pl. 46. But the most important work for reference is that of Μ. Alix himself (op. cit,, pp. 373-471,plates 1-3, “Appareil actif de la Locomotion”).]

The cutaneous muscles of Birds are well developed, and form broad expansions in various parts of the body. Special bundles of muscular fibres pass to the great quill feathers of the tail and wings, and others to the patagium, a fold of integument which stands between the trunk and brachium behind and between the brachium and ante-brachium in front. In correspondence with the slight mobility of the dorsal vertebrae, the episkeletal and hyposkeletal muscles of the spine attain a considerable development only in the neck and in the tail. Owing to the great size of the sternum, the abdominal muscles are usually small, and the internal oblique may be absent. A diaphragm, consisting of bundles of muscular fibre,^[47. See Macgillivray, Brit. Birds, vol. ii. plate 11, fig. 1, v.v.v.] which pass from the ribs to the aponeurosis, covering the ventral face of the lungs, is developed in all Birds, but attains to the greatest degree of completeness in the Ratitoe, and especially in Apteryx. The muscles of the limbs are remarkably modified by the excessive development of some of those found in other Vertebrata, and the suppression of others.

Thus in all birds possessing the power of flight, the pectoralis major, the chief agent of the downward stroke of the wing, is very large and thick, taking its origin from the whole length, and a great part of the depth, of the keel of the sternum. The elevation of the wing is chiefly effected by the pectoralis secundus (levator humeri; or p. medius, Macg., plate 3, figs. 4, 5), which arises beneath (within and over, in the standing bird) the foregoing muscle, and passes over the inner side of the scapulo-coracoid articulation as over a pulley, to reach the humerus. The muscles of the fore-arm and digits are reduced, in accordance with the peculiar modification of the skeleton of these parts. In the hind limb of most birds there is a singular extensor muscle, which arises from the pubis, and ends in a tendon which passes to the outside of the knee-joint and terminates in the leg by uniting with the flexor digitorum perforatus. The result of this arrangement is that the toes are flexed whenever the leg is bent upon the thigh, and consequently the roosting bird is held fast upon his perch by the weight of his own body.^[48. See J. Alph. Borelli, De Motu. Animalium, Ro≡, 1680-1682, Lugd. Bat. 1865; and Bibliotheca Anatomica, Geneva, 1685, plate 82, figs. 4-7.]

The Brain.

In Birds, as in Reptiles, the cerebro-spinal axis is angu-lated at the junction of the spinal cord with the medulla oblongata, the latter being bent down towards the ventral side of the body. The region on which the nerves of the anterior and posterior extremities originate is enlarged in Birds. In the lumbar enlargement the posterior columns of the cord diverge and give rise to the sinus rhomboidalis, which is a sort of repetition of the fourth ventricle, the dilated central canal of the spinal cord being covered merely by a thin membrane, consisting chiefly of the ependyma and arachnoid. The brain fills the cavity of the skull, and presents a well-developed cerebellum; a mesencephalon, divided above into two optic lobes; and relatively large prosencephalic hemispheres, which attain a considerable size but never conceal the optic lobes. The transverse fissures of the cerebellum are distinct, and the lateral appendages of the cerebellum, or flocculi, become well defined, and are wedged, as in many of the lower Mammalia, in cavities of the side walls of the skull, arched over by the anterior vertical semicircular canal.

There is no pons Varolii, in the sense of transverse fibres connecting the two halves of the cerebellum, visible upon the ventral surface of the mesencephalon. The optic lobes contain ventricles; these are thrown down to the sides of the base of the brain, and are connected over the aquaeductus Sylvii by a broad commissural band. Each prosencephalic lobe contains a lateral ventricle (continuous through the [9:3:725] foramen of Munro with the third ventricle), which is little more than a fissure between the very thin inner wall of the lobe and its thick outer part, which contains the corpus striatum. The corpora striata are united by an anterior commissure, which is not of large size. The thinning of the inner wall of the lobes, from the margin of the foramen of Munro backwards, which gives rise to the fissure of Bichat in the Mammalia, extends for a very short distance in the Sauropsida, even in Birds. The olfactory lobes are usually elongated, and contain ventricles continuous with those of the prosencephalic hemispheres. In all the Sauropsida the motor nerves of the tongue pass through a foramen in the occipital bone. Hence twelve pairs of cranial nerves are present, except in the Ophidia, which possess no spinal accessory nerves. The lateral cutaneous branches, so generally sent to the trunk by the pneumogastric in the Ichthyopsida, are absent, but the pneumogastric gives a recurrent branch to the larynx. The third, fourth, and sixth nerves arise quite independently of the fifth. The sympathetic is well developed.^[49. See Owen, Art. “Aves,” Cyclop. Anat. Phys., pp. 298, 299; Macgillivray, Brit. Birds, vol. i. p. 48, and vol. iii. plate 18; Owen “On Brain of Apteryx," Trans. Zool. Soc., vol. vii. plates 45 and 46, p. 381. For the development of the Fowl’s brain, see Foster and Balfour's Elem. of Embryology; see also Huxley, Anat. Vert. Anim., p. 301, figs. 90, 91.]

Organs of Sense.

Birds possess nasal glands, which attain a large size, and lie more usually upon the frontal bone, or in the orbits, than in the nasal cavity. In the Snakes and Lizards these bones lie between the septo-maxillaries above and the vomers below. In Birds, w ι herever placed, the duct opens near the same region as in the Reptiles. In many kinds, especially Passerines, the bones that should cover them are really present, but are rudimentary and attached to the vomer. These are the septo-maxillaries.

The eye in many Birds, as in the extinct Lchthyosauria, attains very great absolute and relative dimensions. Birds possess, like many Reptiles, a nictitating membrane.^[50. See Macgillivray, Brit. Birds, vol. iii., plate 17, p. 146, forexcellent figures and descriptions of the Bird's eye; also Owen, article “Aves,” Cyclop. Anat. and Phys., p. 303. For its development, Foster and Balfour’s work, p. 97. The Bird’s eye being a more highly specialized Reptilian organ, its condition in the lower types of the Sauropsida is also given in the text.] In the Lizards a short, thick muscle (bursalis) is attached to the inner and posterior wall of the orbit, and ends in a fibrous sheath. A tendon, one end of which is attached to the presphenoidal region of the inner wall of the orbit, passes backwards through the sheath, and then forwards, to be attached to the nictitating membrane. When the muscle contracts, it necessarily pulls the latter over the eye. A Harderian gland is always developed, and a lachrymal gland very generally, but not always. In the Chelonia, muscular fibres (forming the so-called pyramidalis muscle) arise from the inner side of the eyeball, and, arching over it at the optic nerve, are inserted partly into the outer edge of the nictitating membrane, partly into the lower eyelid. The Crocodilia have a pyramidalis muscle taking the same origin and course; but it sends no fibres to the lower eyelid, its tendon being inserted altogether into the nictitating membrane. The third arrangement, which in a manner brings together the first and the second, is that seen in Birds. A pyramidalis muscle, arising from the inner and under surface of the eyeball, soon ends in a tendon which sweeps round the upper and outer surfaces of the sclerotic to the nictitating membrane, as in the Crocodiles. But there is also a bursalis muscle, which however arises, not, as in Lizards, from the wall of the orbit, but from the upper surface of the sclerotic itself, whence it passes backwards and ends in a fibrous sheath which encloses the tendon of the pyramidalis. The contraction of the muscle necessarily tends to draw the tendon of the pyramidalis away from the optic nerve. A tubercle is sometimes developed from the sclerotic above the entrance of the optic nerve, and prevents the tendon of the pyramidalis from shifting forwards and inwards. The eyeball is always turned by four recti and two obliqui muscles. The superior oblique does not pass over a pulley. The Chelonia and most Lacertilia have a more or less completely developed retractor or choanoid muscle. A ring formed of bony plates is developed in the fore-part of the sclerotic in Lacertilia, Chelonia, lchthyosauria, Dicynodontia, Pterosauria, and Aves ; but not in Ophidia, Plesiosauria, or Crocodilia. The iris and tensor choroidei contain striated muscular fibres. A pecten is very generally developed. It attains a large size, and becomes much plaited in Aves. Even in Birds, the sclerotic is cartilaginous.

In the organs of hearing, also, the Bird is best studied as a culmination of the Sauropsida.

Only Crocodilia and Aves possess a rudiment of an external ear. The Ophidia and the Amphisboenoidea have no tympanic cavity. In some Chelonia, in Sphenodon, and in the Chameleons, the tympanic membrane is covered by integument, but a tympanic cavity exists. In Lacertilia the tympanic cavities communicate by wide openings with the pharynx; but in Chelonia, Crocodilia, and Aves, the communicating passages, reduced in size, become eustachian tubes. In the Chelonia these curve backwards, downwards, and inwards, round the quadrate bones, and open separately on the roof of the mouth. In the Crocodilia there are three eustachian tubes—one median, and two lateral. In Aves there is but one eustachian aperture, answering to the median of the Crocodilia; and, as in the latter group, each eustachian tube usually traverses the osseous base of the skull to join its fellow in the common aperture.

The stapes is a columelliform bone, the outer end of which is attached to the tympanic membrane when the latter is developed, but lies among the muscles when there is no tympanic cavity (Snakes and Amphisboenoe). All Sauropsida possess a fenestra rotunda, as well as a fenestra ovalis; and all have a cochlea, which is never coiled spirally, and is more rudimentary in the Chelonia than in other groups. Three semicircular canals, an anterior and a posterior vertical and an external horizontal, are connected with the membranous vestibule. In Aves, the anterior vertical canal is very large in proportion to the others, and the adjacent crura of the two vertical canals overlap before they unite with one another.^[51. See Macgillivray, Brit. Birds, vol. iii. plate 18, figs. 2 and 3, p. 156; Owen, article “Aves,” in Cyclop. Anat. and Phys., p. 308, fig. 141. For development, see Foster and Balfour’s work, p. Ill; Huxley on “Incus and Stapes,” p. 398; and Parker, var. loc.]

Alimentary Organs.

Well-developed sub-lingual, sub-maxillary, and parotid glands appear in Birds, and the sub-lingual glands attain an immense size in the Woodpeckers (Macg., Brit. Birds, vol. iii. plate 15). The tongue varies greatly, being sometimes obsolete (as in the Crocodile). It is small in the Totipalmatae and in Baloeniceps. It is generally sagittiform and papillate at the base; but it is thick, and even emarginate in the Rapaces (Macg., Brit. Birds, vol. iii. plates 19, 20). In the Picidoe (op. cit., plate 15), where the hyoid bones are extremely elongated and the tongue pre-hensible to a marvellous degree, the true lingual part is a small arrow-head, covered with a prickly, horny sheath; these prickles are reverted, like a Snake’s teeth.

The alimentary canal of Birds may have several dilatations[9:3:726] above the intestine; the latter is divisible into small and large, and the last always terminates in a cloaca. It is invested by a peritoneal coat, which follows the curvatures of the intestine. In most Birds, as in the Crocodiles, the pyloric and cardiac apertures are approximated. In many Crocodilia and Aves {e.g., Ardeidae) there is a υyloric dilatation before the commencement of the duodenum. In the Alectoromorphoe, in Eagles and Hawks amongst the Aetomorphoe, and in Pigeons, the oesophagus is enlarged into a “crop.” In the latter it is bilobate and symmetrical (Macg., op. dt., vol. i. plate 7).

In the Crocodilιa and in Aves the walls of the stomach are very muscular, and the muscular fibres of each side radiate from a central tendon or aponeurosis.. The thickening of the muscular tissue of the stomach attains its maximum in the Graminivorous Birds; and it is accompanied by the development of the epithelium into a dense and hard coat, adapted for crushing the food of these animals. Birds commonly aid the triturating power of this gastric mill by swallowing stones; but the habit is not confined to them, Crocodiles having been observed to do the same thing.^[52. See Sir S. Baker’s lsmailia, vol. i. p. 295 “The stomach contained about five pounds’ weight of pebbles (in a Crocodile 12 feet 3 inches long in its entire length), as though it had fed upon flesh resting upon a gravel bank, and had swallowed the pebbles that adhered. ’ This intrepid traveller seems to be unaware that the Crocodile has a strong gizzard.] Birds are further remarkable for the development of a broad zone of glands in the lower part of the oesophagus, which is usually dilated, and forms a proventriculus, connected by a narrow neck with the gizzard (gigerium). In Sula alba and Phalacrocorax carbo, the writer, long ago, saw this zone to be imperfect. In these birde the gullet is very capacious from the pharynx downwards, but the proventriculus is still more so,—it is a large “paunch.”

Some Ophidia have a caecum at the junction of the small intestine with the large; and two such caeca, which sometimes attain a large size, are generally developed in Aves. In this class, also, the small intestine not unfrequently presents a caecal appendage, the remains of the vitelline duct. The writer’s drawings show this in Gallinula chlo∙ ropus, Ardea cinerea, and Colymbus septentrionalis. The duodenum of Birds constantly makes a loop, within which the pancreas lies, as in the Mammalia.

The liver in the Sauropsida almost always possesses a gall bladder, which is usually attached to the under surface of the right lobe, but in Ophidia is removed to some distance from it.

A peculiar glandular sac, the bursa Fabricii, opens into the anterior and dorsal region of the cloaca in Birds.^[53. Besides copious unpublished materials on this subject from his own dissections, the writer is largely indebted to Macgillivray’s most valuable work, so full of illustrations of the digestive organs of Birds; also to Prof. Owen's article “Aves” (op. cit.); tc Prof. Huxley he owes form and order. For the development of these parts the reader is still directed to Foster and Balfour’s work, as also of the parts yet to be described.]

The Heart.

In Birds, the venous and arterial blood currents communicate only in the pulmonary and systemic capillaries. The auricular and ventricular septa are complete (see Owen, “Aves,” p. 330), as in the Crocodilia; but the right ventricle only gives off the pulmonary artery, the left aortic arch has disappeared, and the right arch (the 4th of that side in the embryo) becomes the most important of all the arches. The septum of the cavum pulmonale becomes a great muscular fold, and takes· on the function of an auriculo-ventricular valve. At the origin of the pulmonary artery, and at that of the aortic arch, three semilunar valves are developed

In Aves there is no renal portal system, and the anterior abdominal vein opens into the inferior vena cava, close to the heart. Nevertheless, a median trunk, which is given off from the caudal vein, carries a considerable proportion of its blood directly into the hepatic portal system. The pericardium of the Bird is thin, but of a firm texture, and adheres by its external surface to the surrounding air-cells. (Owen, “Aves,” p. 330.)

Respiratory and Vocal Organs.^[54. We shall here give Professor Huxley’s excellent abstract of what is known upon this subject up to this time; but the reader is refeιτed to Joh. Müller’s work, “Researches on the Comparative Anatomy of the Vocal Organs of Birds,” Berlin Acad., June 1845, and Ann. and Mag.N. H., vol. xvii. p. 499. Macgillivray has many excellent illustrations and descriptions of these parts; and the writer followed him step by step many years ago.]

“In Birds there are distinct thyroid, cricoid, and aιytenoid cartilages, which may be more or less completely ossified. Sometimes an epiglottis is added.^[55. For a clear description of the exquisite structure of the tracheal rings in Birds, see Macg., vol. ii. p. 34. They are often thoroughly ossified, and are notched above and below, both before and behind; and alternate ridges allow a marvellous amount of overlapping, the edges being well bevelled; each ring is an ellipse.] The voice of Birds, however, is not formed, in the larynx, but in the syrinx or lower larynx, which may be developed in three positions :—1. At the bottom of the trachea, from the trachea alone; 2. At the junction of the trachea and bronchi, ami out of both; 3. In the bronchi alone. The syrinx may be altogether absent, as in the Ratitoe and the Cathartidoe or American Vultures. The commonest form of syrinx is the second mentioned above, or the bronchi-tracheal syrinx. It is to be met with in all our common Song Birds, but is also completely developed in many Birds, such as the Crows, which have no song. In its commonest condition this form of syrinx presents the following characters: The hindermost rings of the trachea coalesce, and form a peculiarly formed chamber, the tympanum. Immediately beyond this the bronchi diverge, and from their posterior wall, where one bronchus passes into the other, a vertical fold of the lining membrane rises in the middle line towards the tympanum, ana forms a vertical septum between the anterior apertures of the two bronchi. The anterior edge of this septum is a free and thin membrana semilunaris, but in its interior a cartilaginous or osseous frame is developed, and becomes united with the tympanum. The base of the frame is broad, and sends out two cornua, one along the ventral, and the other along the dorsal edge of the inner wall of the bronchus of its side, which in this part of its extent is membranous and elastic, and receives the name of the membrana tympaniformis interna.

‘ ‘ The bronchial ‘ rings ’ opposite this are necessarily incomplete internally, and have the form of arches embracing the outer moiety of the bronchus. The second and third of these bronchial arcs are freely movable, and elastic tissue accumulated upon their inner surfaces gives rise to a fold of the mucous membrane, which forms the outer boundary of a cleft, bounded on the inner side by the membrana semilunaris.

“The air forced through these two clefts from the lungs sets these elastic margins vibrating, and thus gives rise to a musical note, the character of which is chiefly determined by the tension of the elastic margins and the length of the tracheal column of air. The muscles, by the contraction of which these two factors of the voice are modified, are extrinsic and intrinsic. The former are possessed by Birds in general, and are usually two pairs, passing from the trachea to the furcula and to the sternum (Macg., vol. ii. plate 12, fig. 8, d.d., e.e.; and vol. iii. plate 15, m.m., n.n.) Some Birds possessing a broncho-tracheal syrinx such as has been described, as the Alectoromorphoe (see Macg., vol. ii. plate 12, fig. 8, ∕.), Chcno∙ morphoe, and Dysporomorphce, have no intrinsic muscles. Most others have one pair, attached on one side to the rings of the trachea above, and to the tympanum, or the proximal bronchial arcs below (Macg., vol. ii. plate 12, figs. 1, 2; and vol. iii. plate 19). The majority of the Coracomorphoe (Macg., vol. ii. plates 10, 11) have five or six pairs of intrinsic syringeal muscles, which pass from the trachea and its tympanum to the movable bronchial arcs.^[56. Macgillivray (op. cit., vol. ii. pp. 26,28) was afraid to be thought overstating the number of these intrinsic muscles. He understated them, not thoroughly making out their divisional lines.] The Parrots have no septum, and only three pairs of intrinsic muscles.

“The tracheal syrinx only occurs in some American Coraco∙ morphoe. The hinder end of the trachea is flattened, and six or seven of its rings above the last are interrupted at the sides, and held together by a longitudinal ligamentous band. These rings are excessively delicate, so that the part of the trachea is in great part membranous. The bronchial syrinx occurs only in Steatomis and Crotophaga.
[9:3:727]

“In the genus Cinyxis, among the Clιelonia, and in some species of Crocodilus (C. acutus, c.g.), the trachea is bent upon itself. Similar flexures attain an extraordinary development in many Birds, and may lie outside the thorax under the integument (Tetrao urogallus, some species of Cran and Penelope) ; in the cavity of the thorax (some Spoonbills); under the body of the sternum, in a large chamber hollowed out of the keel (some Swans and Cranes); even in a sort of cup formed by the median process of the furcula (Numida cristata). In the Emeu some of the rings of the trachea are incomplete in front, and bound the aperture of an air-sac which lies in front of the trachea. Some Birds (Aptenodytes, Procellaria) have the trachea divided by a longitudinal septum, as in Sphargis among the Chelonia. The tracheal tympanum is greatly enlarged in Cephaloptcrus, and in many Ducks, Geese, and Divers; and in these aquatic birds the enlargement is more marked in the males, and is usually symmetrical, the left side being generally the larger.”

“In Aves the lungs are firmly fixed on each side of the vertebral column, the dorsal surface of each lung being moulded to the superjacent vertebrae and ribs. The muscular fibres of the diaphragm arise from the ribs outside the margins of the lungs, and form the vertebral column, and end in an aponeurosis upon the ventral surface of the lungs. Each bronchus enters its lung nearer the centre than the anterior edge, and, immediately losing its cartilaginous or bony rings, dilates, and then traverses the lung, gradually narrowing to the posterior edge of that viscus, where it terminates by opening into the posterior air-sac, which generally lies in the abdomen. From the inner side of the bronchus canals are given off, one near its distal end, and others near its entrance into the lung, which pass directly to the ventral surface of the lung, and there open into other air-sacs. Of these there are four. Two, the anterior and the posterior thoracic, lie in the ventral face of the lung in the thorax. The other two are situated in front of its anterior end, and are extra-thoracic. The external and superior is the cervical; the internal and inferior the inter-clavicular (Macg., vol. ii., p. 17, fig. 107). This last unites into one cavity with its fellow of the opposite lung. Thus there are altogether nine air-sacs; two posterior or abdominal, four thoracic, two cervical, and one inter-clavicular. Other large canals given off from the bronchus do not end in air-sacs, but those which pass from the inner side of the bronchus run along the ventral surface, and those on the outer side along the dorsal surface of the lung. Here they give off at right angles a series of secondary canals, and these similarly emit still smaller tertiary canals, and. thus the whole substance of the lung becomes inter-penetrated by tubuli, the walls of the finest of which are minutely sacculated. The different systems of tubuli are placed in communication by perforations in their walls. In most birds these air-sacs (except the anterior and posterior thoracic, which never communicate with any cavity but that of the lungs) are in communication with a more or less extensively ramified system of air passages, which may extend through a great many of the bones, and even give off subcutaneous sacs. Thus the inter-clavicular air-sac generally sends a prolongation into each axilla, which opens into the proximal end of the humerus, and causes the cavity of that bone to be full of air. When the sternum, the ribs, and the bones of the pectoral girdle are pneumatic, they also receive their air from the inter-clavicular air-sacs. The cervical air-sacs may send prolongations along the vertebral canal of each side; which supply the bodies of the cervical vertebrae, and communicate with elongated air-chambers in the spinal canal itself. When the dorsal vertebrae are pneumatic they communicate with the system of the cervical air-sacs. The abdominal air-sacs send prolongations above the kidneys to the sacral vertebrae and to the femora, whence these bones, when they are pneumatic, receive their air. The pulmonary air-sacs and their prolongations do not communicate with the air cavities of the skull, which receive their air from the tympana and the nasal chambers. In some Birds (Passerinoe) the air is conducted from the tympanum to the articular piece of the mandible by a special bony tube, the siphonium [the largest of the tympanic chain, and having the general anatomical relations of the ichthyic ‘ interopercular. ’]”

Renal and Reproductive Organs.

The kidneys of Birds are composed of a number of lobules of unequal sizes, and these are packed in the concavities of the pelvis, in the same manner as the lungs are packed in the regular intercostal spaces of the upper part of the thorax. The ureters, as in the Reptiles, open directly into the cloaca; but there is no urinary bladder. The bursa Fabricii opens into the cloaca above its hinder part.

The testes lie on each side the foremost lobes of the kidneys. They are very small in mid-winter, and largest by the middle of April. In the embryo Bird there are two oviducts. “The duct of Müller on the right side (that on the left side with the corresponding ovary generally disappearing) remains in the female as the oviduct. In the male it is almost entirely obliterated on both sides” (Foster and Balfour, p. 168).

Integument and Feathers.^[57. This abstract is taken (by ⅛β author’s permission) from Professor Huxley’s Anatomy of Vertebrated Animals, pp. 274, 275. For a full account of these structures, see Nitzsch’s Pterylography, translated from the German by Dr P. L. Sclater, F.R.S., Ray Soc., 1867.]

“The exoskeleton of Birds consists almost entirely of epidermic structures in the form of horny sheaths, scales, plates, or feathers. No Bird possesses dermal ossifications, unless the spurs, which are developed upon the legs and wings of some species, may be regarded as such.

The feathers are of various kinds. Those which exhibit the most complicated structure are called pennoe, or contour feathers, because they lie on the surface and determine the contour of the body. In every penna the following parts are to be distinguished :—a main stem {scapus} forming the axis of the feather, and divided into a proximal hollow cylinder, partly imbedded in a sac of the derm, called the calamus, or quill; and a distal vexillum, or vane, consisting of a four-sided solid shaft, the rachis, which extends to the extremity of the feather, and bears a number of lateral processes, the barbs. The calamus has an inferior aperture {umbilicus inferior), into which the vascular pulp penetrates, and a superior aperture {umbilicus superior), situated on the under surface of the feather at the junction of the calamus with the scapus. The barbs are narrow plates, tapering to points at their free ends, and attached by their bases on each side of the rachis. The edges of these barbs are directed upwards and downwards, when the vexillum of the feather is horizontal. The interstices between the barbs are filled up by the barbules, —pointed processes, which stand in the same relation to the barbs as the barbs do to the rachis. The barbules themselves may be laterally serrated and terminated by little hooks, which interlock with the hooks of the opposed barbules. In very many Birds each quill bears two vexilla; the second, called the after-shaft {hypo-rachis), being attached on the underside of the first close to the superior umbilicus. The after-shaft is generally much smaller than the chief vexillum; but in some Birds, as the Casuariidoe, the two are of equal size, or nearly so. Muscles pass from the adjacent integuments to the feather sac, and by their contraction erect the feather. The other kinds of feathers differ from the pennae, in having the barbs soft and free from one another, when they constitute pennoplumoe, or plumuloe (down), according as the scapus is much or little developed. When the scapus is very long, and the vexillum very small or rudimentary, the feather is termed a filopl·uma.

The contour feathers are distributed evenly over the body only in a few Birds, as the Ratitae, the Penguins, and some others. Generally, the pennae are arranged in definitely circumscribed patches or bands, between which the integument is either bare or covered only with down. These series of contour feathers are termed pteryloe, and their interspaces apteria.

In some Birds, such as the Herons, plumulae of a peculiar kind, the summits of which break off into a fine dust or powder as fast as they are formed, are developed upon certain portions of the integument, which are termed powder-down patches. ^[58. See Bartlett, “On the Balaeniceps,” Proc. Zool. Soc., March 26, 1861, pp. 1-4; aκd Murie “On the Dermal and Visceral Structures of the Kagu, Sun-Bittern, and Boat-Bill,” Trans. Zool. Soc., 1871, plate 56, pp. 465-492; in this valuable paper the powder-down patches are also shown in Podargus and Cacatua.]
[9:3:728]

The integument of Birds is, for the most part, devoid of glands; but many Birds have a peculiar sebaceous gland developed in the integument which covers the coccyx. This uropygial gland secretes an oily fluid, which the Bird spreads over its feathers by the operation of “preening.” The excretion passes out by one or two apertures, commonly situated upon an elevation, which may or may not be provided with a special circlet of feathers.

In various Birds (e.y., the Turkey) the integument about the head and neck develops highly vascular and sometimes erectile processes (combs, wattles).

Within the extremely narrow space of an article like the present, the merest abstract of most of our present ornithotomical knowledge can be given. A mere list of the published works on the subject would fill most of the space allotted to the writer. We will conclude by giving Professor Huxley’s masterly comparison of the Bird class and that of the Reptiles below with the Mammalia above them (see Proc. Zool. Soc., April 11, 1867). The writer has modified some assertions from later papers by the same author :—

“That the association of Birds with Reptiles into one primary group of the Vertebrata, the Sauropsida, is not a mere fancy, but that the necessity of such a step is as plain and demonstrable as any position of taxonomy can be, appeal’s to me to be proved by an enumeration of the principal points in which Aves and Reptilia agree with one another and differ from the Mammalia.

“1. They are devoid of hair.

“2. The centra of their vertebrae have no epiphyses.

“3. Their skulls have single occipital condyles.

‘ ‘ 4. The prootic bone either remains distinct throughout life, or unites with the epiotic and opisthotic after these nave become ankylosed with the supra-occipital and exoccipital.

“5. The malleus is not subservient to the function of hearing, as [one of the] ossicula auditus.

“6. The mandible is connected with the skull by the intermediation of a quadrate bone [which represents the upper bulbous part, with the ‘ manubrium ’ of the malleus of Mammalia].

“7. Each ramus of the mandible is composed of a number of separate ossifications, which may amount to as many as six in all. (Of these the articulare represents the [antero-inferior part of the] malleus of Mammalia).

“8. The apparent ‘ankle-joint’ is situated not between the tibia and the astragalus, as in the Mammalia, but between the proximal and distal divisions of the tarsus,^[59. See Gegenbaur, Archiv für Anatomie (1863), and Untersuchungen zur vergleichenden Anatomie (1864).]

“9. The brain is devoid of any corpus callosum.

“10. The heart is usually provided with two aortic arches; if only one remains, it is the right.

“11. The red blood-corpuscles are oval and nucleated.

“12. The cavities of the thorax and abdomen are never separated by a complete diaphragm.

“13. The allantois, which is highly vascular, is very large, and envelops the embryo; but no villi for placental connection with the parent are developed upon it.

“14. There are no mammary glands.” (W. K. P.)

FOSSIL BIRDS.

Footprints, or casts of footprints, at the time of their discovery and long afterwards supposed to be those of Birds, were found about the year 1835 in the Triassic formation of the valley of the Connecticut in New England, and were described by Messrs Deane and Marsh. Subsequently Professor Hitchcock and Mr Warren contributed to the elucidation of these tracks, which were ascribed to various genera of the Class that received the names of Amblonyx, Argozoum, Brontozoum, Grallator, Omithopus, Platypterna, Tridentipes, and others. No portion of any of the animals to which these traces are due seems to have been met with,^[60. The only known bones from this deposit were exhibited by Professor W. B. Rogers at the meeting of the British Association in Bath (R,ep. Br. Ass. 1864, Trans. Sect., p. 66).] and the best American palaeontologists are now inclined to attribute them rather to Dinosaurian Reptiles than to Birds. Whatever may be throught of the rest, it appears meet likely that the creatures designated as Platypterna and Tridentipes were certainly not ornithic. Brontozoum must have been a colossal animal, its footprint measuring about 16∣ inches in length and its stride some 8 feet.

An enormous space of time separates these reputed Ornithichnites, as they are called, from the first undoubted fossil Bird, This was discovered in 1861 by Andreas Wagner in the lithographic slate of Solenhofen in Bavaria, belonging to the Oolitic series, and is commonly known by the name of Archaeopteryx ^[61. Herr Hermann von Meyer had previously described a fossil feather from the same formation, to the owner of which he gave this name. Its specific, generic, not to say ordinal, identity with the creature whose remains were subsequently found is of course problematical, but the received laws of nomenclature fully justify the common usage.] ? though that of Gryρlcosaurus was given by its original describer to the at present unique specimen now in the British Museum. Unfortunately deficient in some very important parts—such as the head and nearly all the sternal apparatus—it has others in excellent preservation. It was about the size of a Rook (Corvus frugilegus), and along with the greater portion of the skeleton, impressions of many of its feathers, particularly the quills, are plainly visible. Its most obvious peculiarity is the presence of a long Lizard-like tail, composed of twenty vertebrae; but from each of these springs a pair of well-developed rectrices. A scarcely less remarkable feature is that afforded by the extremity of the wings, whereitwould appear that there was a free digit answering to the pollex. The many Reptilian characters of this wonderful creature cannot be noticed in this treatise, though their value must be fully admitted; but since the appearance of Professor Owen’s description of the specimen (Phil. Trans. 1863, p. 33), nobody has hesitated to receive it as a true Bird, though one which exhibits an extraordinary dissimilarity from all other known members of the Class. To make any suggestion as to the more immediate affinities and habits of Archäopteryx were vain. It at present [9:3:729] stands alone, and all that can be said in the latter respect is, that the form of its feet indicates a bird given to a more or less arboreal life. It is not easy to imagine the use in the bearer’s economy of its singular tail, which one would think must have been a clumsy appendage, and this notion is perhaps justified by the certainty that similar tails had gone out of fashion when the next birds known to have existed flourished.

These are from the Cretaceous formation, and as in that freshwater-deposits are few in number, it is not surprising that true ornithic remains are in them exceedingly rare. Many fossils that were formerly thought to have been the remains of Birds have since been determined as belonging to Reptiles (Pterodactyls),—among them the Cimoliornis diomedea, from the Chalk of Maidstone, which Dr Bowerbank has not hesitated to refer to his Pterodactylus giganteus. But in 1858 Barrett discovered, in the Upper Greensand of Cambridge, remains described by Mr Seeley in 1866 (Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. ser. 3, xviii. p. 100) under the name of Pdagornis barretti,— which, we must bear in mind, has nothing to do with the genus Pdagornis established by Μ. Lartet (Comptes Rendus, 1857, p. 740), —and these remains, renamed Enaliornis in 1869 by Mr Seeley (Index to Rep. on Second. Reptiles, <fcc.), seem to be those of a real Bird, having some resemblance to a Penguin. Belonging to the same epoch also Bird-fossils have been found by Professor Marsh in the United States of America, and they have been referred to at least six genera— Apatornis, Graculavus (4 spp.), Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, Laornis, Pdloeotringa (3 spp.), and Telmatornis (2 spp.) The first and fourth of these were about as large as a Pigeon, or larger, are from the Cretaceous shale of Kansas, and differ from all known Birds in having biconcave vertebrae and, possibly, teeth, whence the latter has been made the type of a distinct Subclass, to which the name of Odontornithes is applied. The second belongs to the Steganopodes; the third seems to have been related to the Colymbidoe. The affinities of the fifth have not yet been determined; it was nearly as large as a Swan, and its remains were discovered in the Middle Marl of New Jersey. The sixth was apparently one of the Limicoloe; and the seventh was probably allied to the Rallidoe.

The Eocene period furnished a still greater number of ornitholites. First, perhaps, in bulk is that known as Gastornis parisiensis, found by Μ. Gaston Planté, and soon after by Μ. Hébert, in a conglomerate beneath the Plastic Clay of Bas-Meudon. Much difference of opinion obtains as to the affinities of this Bird, which was at least as large as an Ostrich; but Μ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards,^[62. The writer cannot name this distinguished naturalist without acknowledging the very many · tokens of friendship received at his hands in connection with the present subject, while the summary of fossil ornithology here given is in a great measure due to the article cited in the text a few lines further on. Further details are taken from his magnificent Recherches Anħtomiques et Paléontologiques pour servir à Γ histoire des Oiseaux Fossiles de la France, Paris, 1867-71. The writer has also to express his thanks to Mr Seeley for valuable assistance in this portion of the article.] after reviewing the evidence of others and studying the specimens obtained, considers it (Did. Univ. dΗist. Nat. ed. 2, May 1869) most nearly allied to the Anatidae, from which, however, it differs in so many important characters that it cannot be included among them according to any taxonomic scheme as yet proposed. One may presume, he adds, that it was incapable of flight, though able to swim. Other birds of huge stature lived at a time not much later. Dr Bowerbank has referred the fragment of a tibia from Sheppey, which was a little smaller than that of an Emeu, to a genus Lithornis. On this Mr Seeley has founded his Megalornis, the Lithornis to which Professor Owen, in 1841, had applied the former name, being regarded as resembling a Vulture. This naturalist has also described the fragmentary cranium of a large Bird, combining Dinornithic and Struthious characters, from the same locality, under the name of Dasornis (Tr. Zool. Soc. vii. p. 145), and he has further added from Sheppey (Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. xxix. p. 511) a yet more remarkable form to those previously known from Britain, in the Odontopteryx toliapicus— a creature having its jaws armed with osseous dentιculatιons, and in this respect unlike Professor Marsh’s Ichthyornis, concluding that it was a warm-blooded, feathered, and winged biped, web-footed, and a fish-eater. From Sheppey, [9:3:730] too, were long ago detected portions of a Kingfisher {Halcyon}, and a bird allied to the Gulls or Terns {Larιdoe), while a continuation of the same formation at Highgate has supplied a sternum which has been referred to the Herons {Ardeidoe). The freshwater beds at Hempstead, in the Isle of Wight, have furnished remains called by Mr Seeley {Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist. seτ. 3, xviii. p. 109) Ptenornis— a form of doubtful affinity; and that palaeontologist has described from those of Hordwell a tibia, apparently

Struthious, under the name of Macromis. In the schist of Plattenberg at Glarus a nearly complete skeleton, perhaps belonging to the Passeres, was discovered, and called by Von Meyer Protomis (since renamed by Professor Gervais Osteornis), and other undetermined fragments of birds’ bones, with impressions of their feathers, have been found in several beds of about the same age in France.

The fossils of the Paris Basin and its coeval deposits deserve, however, fuller notice. First brought to light at Montmartre towards the end of the last century, many of the remains fell under the notice of Cuvier, and were by him determined in a manner more or less exact. Following his investigations, the labours of MM. Gervais, Blanchard, and Desnoyers considerably added to our knowledge of these ornitholites, till finally Μ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards, having carefully gone over all the specimens discovered, refers them to the genera Agnopterus, Cormoranus {i.e., Phalacrocorax), Coturnix (2 spp.), Falco, Gypsornis, Leptosomus (a form now only kuown from Madagascar), Limosa, Palaeocircus,Paloeortyx,Pelidna, Rallus, Sitta, and Tringa{1). Of these are extinct the first, which seems to have been in some measure allied to the Flamingoes {Phcenicopteridce); the fifth, a Ralline form; and the eighth and ninth, belonging to the diurnal Birds-of-prey and the Gallinoe respectively. The footprints of at least seven more species of birds have also been recognised in the same beds, so famed for the remains of Anoplotherium, Paloeotherium, and their contemporaries, which were resuscitated by the great Cuvier. The marl-beds of Aix in Provence, belonging to this epoch, have yielded fossil eggs and feathers, but as yet no bones of Birds; and to the same period must probably also be assigned the lacustrine calcareous deposits of Armissan, in Languedoc, whence Μ. Gervais has recovered the remains of a Tetrao. Near Apt, also in Provence, some traces of birds 3eem to have been found, but their bad condition has hindered their determination. In the marls of Ronzon, in Auvergne, several ornitholites have been found by Μ. Aymard, who refers them to the genera Camascelus, Dolichopterus, Elomis (3 spp.), and Teracus. Of these the first was declared to be allied to the Plovers {Charadriidce), the second to the Gulls, the third to the Flamingoes, and the fourth to be a Falconine; but Μ. A. Milne-Edwards considers the first and second to be probably identical. From the same beds Μ. Gervais has eggs and imprints of feathers, as well as a pelvis, referred by him to Mergus, but regarded by Μ. A. Milne-Edwards as a Sula; while Dr Fraas has found remains of a Harrier and a Cormorant on the top of the Swabian Alp. Finally, in North America Professor Marsh has described the remains of no less than five species of birds, varying in size from a Flamingo to a small Woodcock, but all referred by him to a genus Alet-omie, from the Eocene deposits of Wyoming {Am. Joum. Sc. ser. 3, iv. p. 256).

The Miocene formation has yielded by far the greatest number of ornitholites, especially in France, and for want of space they can be barely named here. From lacustrine deposits in Bourbonnais and Auvergne, the remains of nearly fifty species of birds have been distinguished. Besides Paloeortyx, already mentioned (3 spp.), Palcelodus (5 spp.), Pelargopsis, Ibidopodia, Elomis, Hydromis, -and Colymboides are extinct genera to which these fossils are referred. Palcelodus is perhaps the most remarkable of them—a generalized form, unquestionably allied to the Flamingoes, but presenting some characters of the Limicolae, and at least one feature now only found in Podiceps and Colymbus. Pelargopsis and Ibidopodia were Stork-like, while Elornis seems to have been Scolopacine ; Hydrornis must be placed near the Gulls, and Colymboides among the Divers. The rest can be referred to the existing genera— Aquila, Milυus, Bubo, Psittacus (a very noteworthy fact, since no Parrots are now to be found in the Palaearctic Region) Picus, Motacilla, Passer, Columba, Rallus, Phoenicopterus, Grus, Ibis, Totanus, Tringa, Larus, Phalacrocorax, Sula, Pelecanus, and Anas. A very considerable number of forms identical with these have been recovered from the neighbourhood of Mentz, while many ornitholites, whether fossil bones, foot-prints, or impressions of feathers, are supplied by freshwater formations near Berne, and in Provence and Languedoc, belonging to this epoch. The bone-beds of Sanson, in Gascony, are also very productive. Here we have as extinct forms Homolopus, allied to the Picidoe, Necrornis, which seems to belong to the Muso- phagidoe — a family now limited to Africa—and Palaeoper-dix (3 spp.), a Gallinacean; while among existing genera we have represented Aquila, Haliaetus, Strix, Corvus, Phasianus (2 spp.)—a genus generally supposed to have been introduced into Europe in historic times— Rallus, Numenius, Ardea, and Anas. Passing thence to Greece, the remains of birds have been found at Pikermi in Attica —a Phasianus, a Gallus— somewhat larger-than G. sonnerati (the presumed ancestor of our Barndoor-fowl), and a large Grus. In the Tertiary deposits of the lower rangée of the Himalaya, the interesting discovery of an apparently true Struthio (Ostrich) has been made, with an Argala, and possibly a large species of Phaeton. From Steinheim, also, but perhaps of a somewhat later period, the remains of eight species of birds (belonging to the genera Ibis, Ardea, Palcelodus, Anas, and Pelecanus) have been determined by Dr Fraas,^[63. Die Fauna von Steinheim, Stuttgart, 1371-] three of which seem to be specifically iden-∣ tical with those first discovered in France. In the Miocene/ of North America, Professor Marsh has detected bones of/ Meleagris, Sula, Puffi,nus, and Uria, all existing genera, but the first is especially suggestive, since it is now one of the most characteristic forms of the New World. From the Lower Tertiary of the same continent he has also described a Bubo and an extinct genus Uintomis, probably related to the Picidoe {Am. Joum. Sc. ser. 3, iv. p. 259).

The Pliocene epoch is far less rich than the preceding in ornitholites, and what have been found are less well determined. In France, the existence of a Bird-of-prey and several Water-birds has been indicated, but a species of Gallas from Auvergne seems to be the only form established. At Oehningen, in Baden, remains have been found, and referred to Scolopax and Anas (probably also to Anser), while from Radoboj, in Croatia, the almost entire foot of a bird has been assigned to Fringilla by Hermann von Meyer, who has further detected in Germany a fossil humerus, on which he founds a genus Ardeadtes, allied to the Herons. From the Pliocene of North America Professor Marsh has described remains of an Aquila, a Grus, and a Phalacrocorax.

The Postpliocene of the same continent has rewarded [9:3:731] the same palaeontologist with two more species of Meleagris, another Grus, and an Uria. In Europe, beds of that epoch have not furnished very many ornitholites, while such as are known have been insufficiently studied. A Gallus, however, seems to have been found at Paris by Μ. Gervais, and other portions of the same bird have been recognized from the caves of Aquitaine by Μ. A. Milne-Edwards. Near Quedlinburg, remains referred to Crows, Sparrows, Swallows, a Bustard, and a Gull, have been recognized, as well as an apparent Vulturine from Magdeburg. Hermann von Meyer has indicated from the valley of the Lahn, Crows, Thrushes, Partridges, and Ducks, as well as a Numida from Salzbach. A small Owl, too, has been found at Kostritz. In England, remains of a Swan and a Cormorant have occurred in the diluvial beds of Grays in Essex, and an Owl of middle size in the Norwich Crag, which may, however, be of Pliocene age; while in France the celebrated gravels of St Acheul have supplied a bone believed by Μ. A. Milne-Edwards to belong to the Grey Lag-Goose (Anser cinereus}, to which species, also, an egg found in brick earth at Fisherton, near Salisbury, has been referred by Mr Blackmoor, who in the same bed found another egg, supposed to have been that of Aτιαs boschas {Edirib. N. Phil. Journ. N.S. xix. p. 74).

A great number of Birds’ bones have been discovered in caves, and among them some bearing marks of human workmanship. In France we have first a large and extinct species of Crane {Grus primigenia), but more interesting than that are the very numerous relics of two species, the concomitants even now of the Reindeer, which were abundant in that country at the period when this beast flourished there, and have followed it in its northward retreat. These are the Snowy Owl {Nyctea scandiaca), and the Willow-Grouse {Lagopus albus). But here it seems unnecessary further to particularize the genera, much less the species, hitherto discovered in the caves of Europe generally, though doubtless they deserve far greater attention than they have yet received. One exception, however, must be made in the case of Cygnus falconeri, a gigantic Swan from the Zebug cavern in Malta {Trans. Zool. Soc. vi. plate 30). The caves of South America yielded to the laborious explorations of Lund no less than thirty-four species of Birds, of which the greater part are identical with those now existing in the same country; but some have become extinct, and of these the most notable are a large Crax and a large Rhea.

SUBFOSSIL BIRDS.

The next ancient Birds’ bones known to us in the northern hemisphere are probably those of the Danish kitchen-middens. These reveal the existence (very likely, the abundance) of two species, long since banished from the spots where their remains are found—the Capercally {Tetrao urogallus), and the Great Auk or Gare-fowl {Alca impennis). Just as the Lagopus albus in the south of France indicates a subarctic or subalpine country with its normal fauna and flora, so does the former of these shew the coexistence with it of pine-forests in Denmark, though on other evidence it is plain that such forests cannot have existed there for many centuries. The latter, of which more must be said hereafter, does not perhaps prove more than that the surrounding seas, though cold, were free from ice in summer time.

The Birds’ bones hitherto recovered from the ruins of the lake-dwellings in Switzerland are all of species which now occur more or less commonly in the same neighbourhoods, and are therefore of comparatively little interest.

On the other hand, the Fens of East Anglia have yielded proofs of a form now extinct not only in England, but even in Northern Europe. This is the Pelican, of which two humeri, one from Norfolk and the other most likely from the Isle of Ely, are preserved in the museums of the University of Cambridge. Whether the species be identical with either of those which now inhabit some parts of Southern Europe is undetermined; but it was undoubtedly a true Pelecanus, and apparently only differed from P. onocrotalus in its somewhat larger size.

At an uncertain but (geologically speaking) recent epoch in Madagascar, there flourished huge birds of Struthious affinities. The first positive evidence of their former existence was made known in 1851 by Μ. Is. Geoffroy St.- Hilaire, who gave the name of Aepyornis maximus to the species which had laid an enormous egg, sent to Paris a short time before; and the discovery of some bones of corresponding magnitude soon after proved to all but the prejudiced the kinship of the producer of this wonderful specimen, which not unnaturally recalls the mythical Roc that figures so largely in Arabian tales. Three, if not four, well-marked species of this genus have now been characterized from remains found in the drifted sands of the southern part of that island.

Next we must turn to our antipodes. In New Zealand birds’ bones of gigantic size seem to have been first heard of from native report by Mr W. Cυlenso in 1838, and next year Mr R. Taylor obtained “part of a fossil toe” {Ann. Nat. Hist. xiv. p. 82). In the same year, however, and before news of this discovery was published, Mr Rule placed in Professor Owen’s hands the fragment of a bird’s femur, which the latter exhibited and described at a meeting of the Zoological Society, 12th November 1839. Other examples soon came to England, and at a meeting of the same society, 24th January 1843, that learned anatomist applied the name of Dinomis novoe-zealandioe to the newly-found monster {Proc. Zool. Soc. 1843, p. 8). A few months later he was able to pronounce that he had distinguished the remains of five species of the genus {tom. cit. p. 144); and the memoir subsequently published in the Society’s Transactions proved to be the first of a series unrivalled in its kind and fortunately still in progress. Bones innumerable have since been obtained, together with portions of the skin, showing the scales of the tarsus and the feathers of the body, to some of which adhered the tendons and bits of dried muscle, stones from the crop, and eggs, a few of the last containing remains of the embryo. At least eleven good species seem to have been discovered; and these, according to one of the latest authorities, Dr Haast {Addr. Phil. Inst. Canterb. 5th March 1874, p. 6), may be grouped in two families— Dinomithidoe proper, having the back-toe obsolete, and comprising the restricted genus Dinomis (spp. 5) and Mionomis (spp. 2); and Palapterygidoe, possessing a hallux, and including the genera Palapteryx (spp. 2) and Euryapteryx (spp. 2). It used to be taken as proved that all these birds flourished within quite recent times, and sanguine naturalists have even hoped that explorations would shew that all of them were not extinct; but, though there is abundant evidence to prove that they were the contemporaries of man in New Zealand, Dr Haast most strongly urges that the race of man who hunted and fed upon the “Moa ”—for such name was applied to its bones by the natives—lived long before the Maori settlement of the islands. Here there is no room for his arguments (Trans. N. Zeal. Inst.), and prudence will perhaps suggest a suspension of judgment on this point. In the same formation as those which hold the relics of these wonderful birds have been found, but far more seldom, remains of others not less interesting. First there is Harpagomis, a Bird-of-prey, of stature sufficient to have made the largest Dinomis its quarry. Then we have Cnemiσmis, a gigantic Goose—possibly related to the genus Cereopsis, with Aptornis and Nbtornis— two Ralline forms, [9:3:732] the first allied to Ocydromus, and the last, which has survived to our own day, though most likely extirpated within the last fifteen years, much resembling Porphyrio. ^[64. A second species now referred to Notoτnis is the Gallinula alba of Latham, which lived on Lord Howe’s (and probably Norfolk) Island. No specimen is known to have been brought· to Europe for more than eighty years, and only one is believed to exist—namely, in the museum at Vienna {Ibis, 1873, p. 44, plate 10). Recent enquiries, made at the present writer’s request, have failed to furnish any result. The bird is doubtless extinct. {Cf. Rowley, Ornithological Miscellany, pp. 38-48.)] In company with these fossil or sub-fossil remains are often associated bones of other forms, which now seem doomed to destraction but still exist. Finally must be mentioned Dromoeornis australis, an extinct Struthious bird, which formerly inhabited Australia, and was allied to Dromoeus, the well-known Emeu.
