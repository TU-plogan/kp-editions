BALUE, Jean, a French cardinal, who raised himself from a very mean station to dignity and honours. He was born of very humble parentage at Angle in Poitou, in 1421, and was first patronised by the bishop of Poitiers. He eventually became almoner to Louis XI., and managed to secure a considerable share in the government; but [9:3:304] being detected in treasonable correspondence with the duke of Bourgogne, he was confined by Louis in an iron cage 8 feet square. On his release, however, eleven years afterwards, he was loaded with honours by Sixtus IV., was sent as legate to France, and received the bishopric of Albano. He died at Ancona in 1491.
