BARBIERI, Paolo Antonio, a celebrated painter of still life and animals, the brother of Guercino, was born at Cento in 1596. He chose for his subjects fruits, flowers, insects, and animals, which he painted after nature with a lively tint of colour, great tenderness of pencil, and a strong character of truth and life. He died in 1640.
