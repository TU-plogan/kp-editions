BALIOL, or Bai.liol, Sir John de, an English baron, after whom Balliol College in Oxford has been named, was the son of Hugh Baliol, of Bernard’s Castle, in the diocese of Durham. His great wealth and power raised him to a prominent position in the kingdom, and he rendered good service to Henry III. in his contest with De Montfort and the revolted barons. In 1263 he endowed several scholarships at Oxford, and formed the intention of founding a college. This he did not accomplish, but after his death in 1269, his widow, Devorgille or Devorguill, carried out his design, and the foundation received the name of Balliol College. Sir John’s son was the well-known John Baliol, the competitor with Bruce for the throne of Scotland.
