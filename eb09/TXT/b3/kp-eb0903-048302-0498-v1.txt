BEDNOR, a town of Hindustan, in the territories of the Râjâ of Mysore, situated in 13° 50' N. lat., and 75° 6' E. long. In 1645 the seat of government of the Râjâs of Ikeri was transferred to this place; as the inhabitants of the former capital removed with the court, Bednor became a city of great importance, containing, it is said, 20,000 houses, besides huts. It was taken and plundered by Haidar All in 1763, who ordered it to be called Haidar-nagar. It is still, however, known by its original name of Bednor. At that time it was estimated at 8 miles in circumference. In 1783 it surrendered to a British detachment under General Matthews, but being shortly after invested by Tipu Sultân, the garrison capitulated on condition of safe conduct to the coast. Tipu violated the stipulation, put General Matthews and the principal officers to death, and imprisoned the remainder of the force. At Tipu , s death it contained 1500 houses, besides huts. The district of Bednor is situated on the summit of that range of hills, the Western Ghâts, which overlooks the provinces of Canara and Malabar. In consequence of its elevation above the sea, and the steepness of the mountain chain, which rises like a wall to thé height of 4000 or 5000 feet, the clouds of the south-west monsoon are here intercepted, and their contents precipitated on the table-land in deluges of rain, which continue for six months in the year, and are extremely favourable to vegetation. Its products are pepper, betel-nut, cardamums, and sandal wood. Cattle of small size are also bred. The imports are salt, rice, cocoa-nuts, oil, turmeric, and cotton cloths.
