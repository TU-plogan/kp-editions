BASSâ€™S STRAITS, the channel which separates Tasmania from Victoria. It is about 180 miles in length from E. to W., and about 140 from N. to S. The navigation of the strait is rendered dangerous in some parts by groups of barren islands and coral reefs scattered through it. It bears the name of Bass, the surgeon of a man-of-war, who was the first to discover, in 1798, indications of a channel between Tasmania and the neighbouring islandcontinent.
