BERNBURG, a city of Anhalt in Germany, and formerly the capital of the now incorporated duchy of Anhalt-Bernburg. It consists of three parts, the Altstadt or old town, the Bergstadt or hill-town, and the Neustadt or new town,—the Bergstadt on the right and the other two on the left of the River Saale, which is crossed by a rather massive stone bridge. It is a well-built city, the principal public buildings being the Government house, the church of St Mary, the Gymnasium, and the house of correction. The castle, formerly the ducal residence, is in the Bergstadt, defended by moats, and surrounded by beautiful gardens. The industries of the town include the manufacture of snuff, paper, starch, and pottery; and a considerable traffic is carried on, especially in grain, both by river and by railway. Bernburg is of great antiquity. The Bergstadt was fortified by Otto III. in the 10th century, and the new town was founded in the 13th. For a long period the different parts were under separate magistracies, the new town uniting with the old in 1560, and the Bergstadt with both in 1824. Prince Frederick Albert removed the ducal residence to Ballenstedt in 1765. Population in 1872, inclusive of the domain and the suburb of Waldau, 15,709.
