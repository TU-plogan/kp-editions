BIZERTA, or Benzert, a seaport of North Africa, in Tunis, 38 miles from the capital, on a gulf or salt lake of the same name, which communicates with a shallow fresh water lake in the interior, formerly called Sisara, and now the lake of Gebel Ishkel. It occupies the site of the ancient Tyrian colony Hippo Zaritus, the harbour of which, by means of a spacious pier, protecting it from the northeast wind, was rendered one of the safest and finest on this coast. This important work, however, having been neglected by the Turks, the port has been to a great extent choked up. It is still visited by small vessels, and a certain amount of trade is carried on. The exports in 1869 were valued at £19,759. The town is about a mile in circuit; it is defended by several forts. The principal employment of the inhabitants is fishing. The adjoining lake abounds in fish, particularly mullets, the roes of which, dried and formed into the substance called botargo, form a considerable article of Mediterranean commerce. N. lat. 37° 17', E. long. 9° 50'. Population, 8000.
