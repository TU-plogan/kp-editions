BENCH, or Banc, has various legal significations.

Free-Bench signifies that estate in copyhold-lands which the wife, being espoused a virgin, has, after the decease of her husband, for her dower, dum sola et casta fuerit, according to the custom of the manor. With respect to this free-bench different manors have different customs.

Queen’s Bench is one of the three superior courts of Common Law at Westminster, the others being the Common Pleas and the Exchequer. Although for many years these tribunals have possessed co-ordinate jurisdiction, there are a few cases in which each possesses exclusive authority, and in point of dignity precedence is given to the Court of Queen’s Bench, the Lord Chief-Justice of which is also styled Lord Chief-Justice of England, and is the highest permanent judge of the Crown. All three courts trace their origin to the avia regia. The Court of Exchequer attended to the business of the revenue, the Common Pleas to private actions between citizens, and the Queen’s Bench retained criminal cases and such other jurisdiction as had not been divided between the other two courts. By 11 Geo. IV. and 1 Will. IV. c. 70, § 8, the Court of Exchequer Chamber was constituted as a court of appeal for errors in law in all three courts. Like the Court of Exchequer the Queen’s Bench assumed, by means of an ingenious fiction, the jurisdiction in civil matters, which properly belonged to the Common Pleas. The functions peculiar to the Queen’s Bench are its jurisdiction in criminal matters, and the general control it exercises over inferior magistrates and other public officers. Of late years the court has consisted of one Lord Chief-Justice and five puisne judges. Under the Judicature Act, 1873, the Court of Queen’s Bench becomes the Queen’s Bench Division of the High Court of Justice; and appeals will in future be taken to the Court of Appeal instead of the Exchequer Chamber.

The Court of Common Pleas is sometimes called the Common Bench.

Sittings in Banc (in the courts of Common Law) are the sittings of the full court for the hearing of motions, special cases, &c., as opposed to the nisi prius sittings for trial of fact≡, where usually only a single judge presides.
