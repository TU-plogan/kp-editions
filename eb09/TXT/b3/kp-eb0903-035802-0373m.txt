BÁRÁSAT, a subdivisional town in the district of the 24 Parganis, under the jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, situated in 22° 43' 24" N. lat. and 88° 31* 45" E. long. For a considerable time Bârasat town was the headquarters of a joint magistracy, known as the “Bârâsat District,” but in 1861, on a re-adjustment of boundaries, Barâsat district was abolished by order of Government, and was converted into a subdivision of the 24 Parganas. Population in 1872—Hindus, 6649; Mahometans, 5133; Christians, 30; and others, 10; total 11,822. Municipal income, £363; expenditure, £289, 4s.; rate of municipal taxation, 7^d. per head. It forms a striking illustration of the rural character of the so-called “towns” in Bengal, and is merely an agglomeration of 41 separate villages, in which all the operations of husbandry go on precisely as in the adjacent hamlets.
