BERKHAMPSTE ΔD, G be at, a market-town of England, in the county of Herts, 26 miles bΓ.W. of London, on the Junction Canal and the North-Western Railway. It has a spacious cruciform church, with a tower of the 16th century, a market-house, erected in 1860, which includes a corn exchange and a library, a grammar school, a free school, several almshouses, a jail, Ac. Straw-plaiting and the manufacture of small wooden wares are the principal industries. The town is of considerable antiquity, and was one of the royal residences under the Mercian kings, a distinction which it again enjoyed under Henry II. The castle, at that time a fortress of some importance, was bestowed on the Black Prince, and since then the manor has remained an apanage of the successive princes of [9:3:592] Wales. The poet Cowper was born in the rectory in 1731. Population in 1872, 4083.
