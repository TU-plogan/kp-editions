BAXTER, Andrew, an able metaphysician, the son of a merchant in Old Aberdeen, was born in 1686 or 1687, and educated at King’s College there. After leaving the university he acted for some years as tutor to various young gentleman, among others to Lord Gray, Lord Blantyre, and Mr Hay of Drummelzier. In 1733 he published, in quarto, but without date, Àn Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul, wherein its immateriality is deduced from the principles of reason and philosophy. In 1741 he went abroad with Mr Hay, and resided several years at Utrecht, from which place he made excursions into Flanders, France, and Germany. He returned to Scotland in 1747, and resided at Whittingham, in Haddingtonshire, till his death, which occurred on April 23, 1750. His principal work, besides the Inquiry, was a short dialogue entitled Matho, sive Cosmotheoria puerilis, Dialogus in quo prima elementa de mundi ordine et ornatu proponuntur, &c. This was afterwards greatly enlarged, and published in English in two volumes 8vo. In 1750 was published an appendix to [9:3:455] his Inquiry into the Nature of the Human Soul, in which he endeavoured to remove some difficulties which had been started against his notions of the vis inertice of matter, by Maclaurin, in his Account of Sir Isaac Newton’s Philosophical Discoveries. To this Baxter prefixed a dedication to John Wilkes, with whom he had formed acquaintance abroad. The Inquiry is a work of no small ability. The author begins by examining, after the principles of the Newtonian philosophy, the properties of matter. All, save one, result from forces which act on matter. The one essential property of matter is its inactivity, vis inertice, or resistance to motion. From this single fact it at once follows that all action or movement must be the effect of some immaterial cause, i.e., of God. The spontaneous motions of the body are not of the same kind as the mechanical movements of the external universe, and are accordingly to be ascribed to a special immaterial force, or spirit, the soul. From the immateriality of the soul its immortality is, of course, deduced. Nor does the conscious existence of the soul depend upon that of the body; it lives after death. Baxter supports his argument by a long analysis of the phenomena of dreams, which he ascribes to direct spiritual influence, and finally attempts to prove that matter is not eternal. A second edition of the Inquiry was published in 1737, and a third in 1745.
