BOBRUISK, a town of Russia, in the government of Minsk, 110 miles S.E. of that city, in 53° 15' N. lat. and 28° 52' E. long., on the right bank of the Berezina, near the confluence of the Bobruiska, on the high road from Mogileff to Brest-Litovsk. Bobruisk was an unimportant place in 1508, when the Moscovite army, sent by the Emperor Basil against the Polish king Sigismund, advanced towards it. In the 17th century there existed a castle, which was burned down in 1649. When the Minsk government was incorporated with Russia, Bobruisk was a small borough; but in 1795 it was raised to the rank of chief town of a department in the Minsk government. In the beginning of the reign of Alexander I. there was erected at Bobruisk, by the advice of General Osterman, a fort, which obtained great importance in 1812, and was made equal to the best in Europe by the Emperor Paul I. The fort proper is built on a height exactly at the confluence of the Bobruiska with the Berezina, nearly a mile from the town. On the right bank of the former river is another small fort, called Fort Frederick William, well supported by a line of defences. In 1860 the population of Bobruisk was 23,761, of whom 11,394 were Jews. It has 2 Greek churches, 17 synagogues, a military hospital, and a departmental college. The only industrial establishments are two potteries. On the river near the town there is a harbour, by which grain and salt are imported from the southern governments.
