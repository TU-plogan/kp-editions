BARÈGES, a small town situated between two mountain chains in the department of Hautes Pyrénées in France, about 25 miles from Bagnères de Bigorre. It is celebrated for its warm sulphurous springs, first brought into notice by the visit of Madame du Maintenon in 1676, the temperature of which varies from 88° to lll 0 Fahr. The benefit of the waters is granted to the army at the expense of the Government, which erected a bath-house in 1864. During the winter the town is so exposed to avalanches that only a few of the residents remain. The town gives its name to a silk-fabric (barège) which is principally manufactured in Bagnères de Bigorre.
