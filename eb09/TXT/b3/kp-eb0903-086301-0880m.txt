BOII, a Celtic people, who at an early date crossed the Alps and established themselves between the Po and the Apennines to the south of the Insubres and Cenomani. On the defeat of their neighbours the Senones by the Romans they joined the Etruscans against the. conquerors, and were involved in the disastrous results of the battle at the Vadimonian Lake in 283 b.c. Equally unsuccessful in the following year, they formed a treaty of peace with the Romans, which they kept for a considerable time, till the encroachments of their conquerors led them to engage in the Great Gallic war of 225 b.c. From that period they continued to indulge their hostility on all occasions, and on the outbreak of the Punic wars gave valuable aid to the Carthaginians from time to time. At length their strength was broken by Scipio Nasica in 191 b.c. ; a large proportion of their territory was appropriated and secured by the colonies of Bononia, Parma, and Mutina; and before long the whole race seems to have been constrained to recross the Alps. They betook themselves to that district of country which is still called 'in consequence Bohemia; but before many centuries they were expelled by other hostile tribes and their separate existence as a people was lost.
