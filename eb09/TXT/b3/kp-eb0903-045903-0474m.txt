BAZA (the mediaeval Bastiana), a city of Spain in the province of Granada, situated in a fruitful valley in the Sierra Nevada, not far from the river of its own name. In the time of the Moors it was one of the three most important cities in the kingdom of Granada, carrying on an extensive trade, and numbering no fewer than 50,000 inhabitants. It was captured by the Spaniards in 1489 after a seven months’ siege. The city still contains various remains of Moorish architecture, as well as its ancient church, which had been converted into a mosque; and in the neighbouring plain have been discovered from time to time numerous relics of antiquity, both Roman and mediaeval. The principal trade of the place is at present in hemp; its population numbers 7270. It is the birthplace of Ribera, the historian of Granada. In 1810 Soult defeated a large Spanish army in the immediate vicinity.

B AZ ARD, Armand, a French socialist, the founder of a secret political society in France, corresponding to the Carbonari of Italy, and a warm adherent of St Simon, was born at Paris in 1791. He took part in the defence of Paris in 1815, and afterwards occupied a subordinate situation in the prefecture of the Seine. About the year 1820 he united some patriotic friends into a society, which was called Amis de la Vérité. From this was developed a complete system of Carbonarism, the peculiar principles of which were introduced from Italy by two of Bazard’s friends. Bazard himself was at the head of the central body, and, while taking a general lead, contributed extensively to the Carbonarist journal, L’ Ar ist arque. An unsuccessful outbreak at Belfort ruined the society, and the leaders were compelled to conceal themselves. Bazard, after remaining for some time in obscurity in Paris, came to the conclusion that the ends of those who wished well to the people would be most easily attained, not through political agitation, but by effecting a radical change in their social condition. Thiβ train of thinking naturally drew him towards the socialist philosophers of the school of St Simon, whom he joined. He contributed to their journal, Le Producteur ; and in 1828 began to give public lectures on the principles of the school, which were well attended. His most important work, however, was the first volume of the Exposition de la Doctrine de St Simon (2 vols., 1828- 30), by far the best account of that peculiar phase of socialism. The second volume was chiefly by Enfantin, who along with Bazard stood at the head of the society, but who was superior in metaphysical power, and was prone to push his deductions to extremities. The two leaders differed in opinion with regard to the emancipation of women, which Bazard disapproved. An open quarrel took place in 1831, and Bazard found himself almost deserted by the members of the society. He attacked Enfantin violently, and in a warm discussion between them he was struck down by apoplexy. After lingering for a few months he died on the 29th July 1832.
