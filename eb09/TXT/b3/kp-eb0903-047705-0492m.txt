BECHE-DE-MER, or Trepang, an important food luxury among the Chinese, Japanese, and other Eastern peoples, connected with the production of which a very considerable commerce exists in the Eastern Archipelago, the coasts of New Guinea, and generally on the coral reefs of the Pacific. It consists of several species of echinoderms, generally referred to the genus IIolothuria; but very many varieties, widely distributed in Eastern seas, are prepared and sold in Chinese and Japanese markets. The creatures, which exist on coral reefs, have bodies from 6 to 15 inches long, shaped like a cucumber, hence a name they receive, — sea cucumbers. The skin is sometimes covered with spicules or prickles, and sometimes quite smooth, and with or without “teats” or ambulacral feet disposed in rows. Five varieties are recognized in the commerce of the Pacific Islands, the finest of which is the “brown with teats,” which are worth, at the place of their preparation, £30 per ton. The large black, which come next in value, bring £25 per ton; the small black £20, red bellied £15, and white £12. The finest of these sell for as much as £100 per ton in China, where they are used in the gelatinous soups, which form an important article of food in that empire. The preparation of the creatures when caught is very simple. They are boiled for about twenty minutes, after which they are split up and gutted, when they are ready for drying. The drying is conducted in large sheds on hurdles placed above a brisk fire. The dried Bêches-demer being very hygrometric, it is necessary that they be immediately packed up and shipped on the conclusion of the drying process; and unless they are thoroughly dry decomposition sets in rapidly and destroys the entire cargo.
