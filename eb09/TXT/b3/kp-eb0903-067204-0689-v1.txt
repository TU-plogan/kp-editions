BILFINGER, George Bernhard, was born on the 23d January 1693, at Cannstadt in Würtemberg. His father was a Lutheran minister. By a singularity of constitution, hereditary in his family, Bilfinger came into the world with twelve fingers and as many toes. From his earliest years he showed the greatest inclination to learning. He studied in the schools of Blaubeuern and Bobenhausen, and afterwards entered the theological seminary of Tübingen. The works of Wolff, which he studied in order to learn mathematics, soon inspired him with a taste for the Wolffian philosophy and that of Leibnitz,—a passion which made him neglect for some time his other studies. Returning to theology, he wished at least to try to connect it with his favourite science of philosophy; and in this spirit he composed the treatise entitled Dilucida-tiones Philosophicos, De Deo, Anima Humana, Mundo, &c. This work, containing nothing original, but giving an admirably clear representation of Wolff’s philosophy, met with great success, and contributed to the advancement of the author, who was appointed soon after to the office of preacher at the castle of Tübingen, and of reader in the school of theology. He soon after left for Halle, in order to attend the lectures of Wolff; and, after two years of study, returned to Tübingen, where the Wolffian philosophy was not yet in favour. He found his protectors there cooled, saw his lectures deserted, and perceived himself shunned, from the dislike of his new doctrines; his ecclesiastical views also suffered from the same cause. By the intervention of Wolff he received an invitation to Petersburg, where Peter I. wished to appoint him professor of logic and metaphysics, and member of his new academy. He was received in that city, where he arrived in 1725, with the consideration due to his abilities. The Academy of Sciences of Paris having proposed about this time the famous problem on the cause of gravity, Bilfinger gained the prize, which was a thousand crowns. His reputation was so much increased by this success that he was almost immediately recalled to his native country by the Duke Eberhard Ludwig of Würtemberg. He quitted St Petersburg in 1731, and in 1735 the Duke Charles Alexander appointed him privy councillor. After careful preparation Bilfinger entered on the duties of his new office, and soon approved himself one of the best and most enlightened ministers that his country had yet produced. Under his wise administration the commerce, public instruction, and agriculture of Würtemberg flourished, and the state was raised to a position it had not before attained. Bilfinger died at Stuttgart on the 18th February 1750.
