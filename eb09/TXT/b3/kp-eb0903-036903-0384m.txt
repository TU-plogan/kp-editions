BARCLAY, John, founder of a small sect in the Scotch Church called Bereans or Barclayites, was born in Perthshire in 1734, and died at Edinburgh in 1798. He graduated at St Andrews, and after being licensed became assistant to the parish minister of Errol in Perthshire. He developed some very peculiar views, which led to a difference with the minister; andin 1763 he left and was appointed assistant to Mr Dow of Fettercairn. In this parish he became very popular, but his opinions, w hether as expounded from the pulpit, or as set forth in a paraphrase of some Psalms which he published, failed to give satisfaction to his Presbytery. In 1772 he was rejected as successor to Mr Dow, and was even refused by the Presbytery the testimonials requisite in order to obtain another living. The refusal of the Presbytery was sustained by the General Assembly, and Mr Barclay thereupon left the Scotch Church. He preached in Edinburgh, London, Bristol, and other places, but with no great success. Neither his writings, which were collected in three volumes, nor the sect formed by him, are of much importance. His adherents were called Bereans, because they regulated their conduct as the inhabitants of Berea are said to have done, by diligently searching the Scriptures (Acts xvii. 11).
