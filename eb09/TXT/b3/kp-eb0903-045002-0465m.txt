BAUTZEN (in Wendish Budissin, which is equivalent to “town ”), the capital of Saxon Upper Lausatia, occupies an eminence on the right bank of the Spree, 680 feet above the level of the sea, and 32 E.N.E. from Dresden. Lat. 51° 11' 10" N., long. 14° 25' 50" E. The town is well built and surrounded by walls, and has extensive suburbs partly lying on the left bank of the river. It has a cathedral which is used by both Protestants and Roman Catholics, and five other churches, a handsome town-house,an orphan-asylum, several hospitals, a mechanics’ institute, a famous gymnasium, a normal and several other schools, and two public libraries. Its general trade and manufactures are considerable, including linen, cotton, and woollen goods, tobacco, leather, paper, saltpetre, gunpowder, &c. Population in 1871, 13,165. Bautzen was already in existence when Henry the Fowler conquered Lausatia in 928. It became a town and fortress under Otto I., his successor, and speedily attained considerable wealth and importance, for a good share of which it was indebted to the pilgrimages which were made to the “Arm of St Peter,” preserved in one of the churches. It suffered greatly during the Hussite war, and still more during the Thirty Years’ War, in the course of which it was besieged and captured by the Electoral Prince, John George (1620), fell into the hands of Wallenstein (1633), and was burned and taken by the Electoral Prince of Saxony. At the Peace of Prague in 1635 it passed with Lausatia to Saxony as a war indemnity. The battle of Bautzen was fought here on the 21st and 22d of May 1813, between the French under Napoleon and the allied forces of Russia and Prussia, in which after severe losses on both sides, the latter were defeated.
