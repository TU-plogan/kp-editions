BAUMGARTEN-CRUSIUS, Ludwig Friedrich Otto, a distinguished German theologian, was born in July 1788 at Merseburg. In 1805 he entered the university of Leipsic, and studied theology and philosophy. In 1812 he was appointed extraordinary professor of theology at Jena, where he remained to the end of his life, rising gradually to the head of the theological faculty. In the midst of his labours as professor and author, he was struck down by apoplexy, and died on the 31st May 1843. Baumgarten-Crusius lectured on almost all the theological disciplines, with the exception of church history; but his great strength lay in the treatment of the history of dogma. His comprehensive knowledge, accurate scholarship, and wide sympathies gave peculiar value to his lectures and treatises on the development of church doctrine. His published w orks were very numerous, the most important being— Lehrbuch der Christlichen Sittenlehre, 1826; Grundzüge der biblischen Theologie, 1828; Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte, 1832; Compendium der Dogmengeschichte, 1840. The last, perhaps his best work, was left unfinished, but was completed in 1846 by Hase from the author’s notes. Commentaries on several of the books of the New Testament, gathered from his papers, were also published after his death.
