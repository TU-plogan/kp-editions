BLAIR, Dr Hugh, was bom April, 7, 1718, at Edinburgh, where his father was a merchant. He entered Edinburgh University in 1730 and won the favourable notice of Professor Stevenson by an essay on the Beautiful, written for the logic class in his sixteenth year. On taking the degree of M.A. in 1739, he printed a thesis De Fundamentis et Obligatione Legis Naturoe, which contains an outline of the moral principles afterwards unfolded in his sermons. He was licensed to preach in 1741, and in a few months the earl of Leven, hearing of his eloquence, [9:3:803] presented him to the parish of Collessie in Fife. In 1743 he was elected to the second charge of the Canongate Church, Edinburgh, where he performed the pastoral duties with great success, until removed to Lady Yester’s, one of the city churches, in 1754. He married his cousin, Katherine Bannatyne, in 1748, and by her had a son, who died in infancy, and a daughter who lived to her twenty-first year. In 1757 the University of St Andrews conferred on him the degree of D.D., and in the following year he was promoted to the High Church, Edinburgh, the most important charge in Scotland. In 1759 he commenced, under the patronage of Lord Kames, to deliver a course of lectures on composition, the success of which led to the foundation of a chair of rhetoric and belles lettres in the Edinburgh University. To this chair he was appointed in 1762, with a salary of £70 a year. Having long taken interest in the Celtic poetry of the Highlands, he published in 1763 a laudatory Dissertation on Macpherson’s Ossian, of which he maintained the authenticity. This critique, after being greatly overrated at the time, has now fallen into neglect. In 1777 the first volume of his Sermons appeared. It was succeeded by other four volumes, all of which met with the greatest success. Dr Samuel Johnson praised them warmly. “I love Blair’s Sermons ·,” Johnson said, “his doctrine is the best limited, the best expressed; there is the most warmth without fanaticism, the most rational transport.” The Sermons were translated into almost every language of Europe, and in 1780, to signify the royal approbation, George III. conferred upon him a pension of £200 a year. In 1783 he retired from his professorship and pxrblished his Lectures on Rhetoric which he had carefully revised, and which have been frequently reprinted. He died, after a brief illness, on the 27th December 1801. In the church Blair belonged to the “moderate” or latitudinarian party, and his Sermons have been objected to as deficient in doctrinal definiteness. His once brilliant reputation is now becoming forgotten. His works display little originality, but are written in a flowing and elaborate style; and his Rhetoric, although inferior to Campbell’s, and wanting in research and depth of thought, is unworthy of the neglect it has met with.
