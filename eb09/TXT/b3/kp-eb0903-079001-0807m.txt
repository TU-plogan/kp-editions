BISHOP-AUCKLAND, a market-town of England, in the county of Durham, 11 miles south-west of the city of Durham. It is beautifully situated on an eminence near the confluence of the Wear and the Gaunless; its streets are well paved and lighted, and there is a good supply of water. The parish church is 1 mile distant, at Auckland St Andrews, but there are several churches and chapels in the town. The town-house, which dates from 1863, is a handsome building, with a tower 100 feet in height; and the palace of the bishop of Durham, which stands at the north-east end of the town, is a spacious and splendid though irregular pile. The site of the palace was first chosen by Bishop Anthony Beck, in the time of Edward I. The present building covers about 5 acres, and is surrounded by a park of 800 acres. The principal industrial establishments are cotton-factories and engineering works; and in the neighbourhood of the town are several coalmines. Population of local board district in 1871, 8736.
