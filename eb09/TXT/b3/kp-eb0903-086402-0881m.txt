BOIS-LE-DUC, ’s Hertogenbosch, or ’s Bosch, a city of Holland, capital of the province of North Brabant, 28 miles S.S.E. of Utrecht. It stands at the confluence of the Dommel and the Aa, and is strongly fortified, being defended by a citadel and two forts. The city is handsome and well built, and is intersected by several canals. It contains seven churches, among which is that of St John, founded in the beginning of the 14th century, and one of the finest ecclesiastical edifices in Holland. It has also a handsome town-hall, surmounted by a tower containing a fine set of chimes, a court-house, Government buildings (formerly a Jesuit monastery), an episcopal palace, an orphan asylum, a grammar school (once attended by Erasmus), a prison, two hospitals, an arsenal, and barracks. The trade of Bois-le-Duc is very considerable; it has several distilleries, breweries, and glass-works, and manufactures linen, needles, cutlery, &c. It is the seat of a vicar-general, and has tribunals of primary instance and commerce. Originally a hunting-lodge of the Brabant dukes, ’s Hertogenbosch, or “Duke’s Wood,” gradually increased, andin 1184 was raised to the rank of a town and surrounded with walls. In 1453 it was greatly enlarged. Successive attempts made by the Netherlands in 1585, 1594, 1601, and 1603 to get possession of the town were futile; but at length, in 1629, it was captured after a five months’ siege. In 1794 it was taken by the French, and in 1814 by the Prussians. Population in 1869, 24,395.
