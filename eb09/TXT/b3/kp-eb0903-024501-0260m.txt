BAILY, Edward Hodges, a distinguished sculptor, was born at Bristol, 10th March 1788, and died at London, 22d May 1867. His father, who was a ship-carver of great repute, destined him for a commercial life, but even at school the boy showed his natural taste and remarkable talents by producing numerous wax models and busts of his schoolfellows, and afterwards, when placed in a mercantile house, still carried on his favourite employment. Two Homeric studies, executed for a friend, were shown to Flaxman, who bestowed on them such high commendation, that in 1807 Baily came to London and placed himself as a pupil under the great sculptor. In 1811 he gained the Academy gold medal for a model of Hercules restoring Alcestis to Admetus, ⅛ωΛ soon after exhibited Apollo discharging his arrows against the Greeks, and Hercules casting Lichas into the sea. In 1821 he was elected R.A., and exhibited one of his best pieces, Eve. He was for many years engaged in lucrative employment as modeller for Messrs Rundell & Co. and Messrs Storr & Mortimer. He was also entrusted with the carving of the bas-reliefs on the south side of the Marble Arch at Hyde Park. Besides numerous busts and statues, such as those of Nelson on the Monument, of Earl Grey, of Lord Mansfield, and others, his finest pieces are, Eve at the Fountain, Eve listening to the Voice, Maternal Affection, Girl preparing for the Bath, and the Graces.
