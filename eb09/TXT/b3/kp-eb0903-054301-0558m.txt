BELL, John, anatomist and surgeon, was born at Edinburgh, 12th May 1763. He had the merit of being the first in Scotland who applied with success the science of anatomy to practical surgery. While still a young man he established, in the face of much opposition, an anatomical theatre in Surgeon Square, where he attracted large audiences by his admirable lectures on anatomy, physiology, and surgery, in which he was assisted by his younger brother Charles. After his exclusion from the infirmary (to which reference has been made in the notice of Sir Charles Bell), he ceased to lecture, and devoted his time to study and practice. He died at Rome in 1820, while on a tour in Italy for the benefit of his health. To great skill in his profession he united high and varied mental abilities and extensive learning.

His principal works are :â€” Anatomy of the Human Body, 3 vols. 8vo, 1793-1802; Discourses on the Nature and Cure of Wounds, 2 vols. 8vo, 1793-95; Principles of Surgery, 3 vols. 8vo, 1801; and. several volumes of Engravings illustrative of Human Anatomy. His Observations on Italy were published by his widow in 1825.
