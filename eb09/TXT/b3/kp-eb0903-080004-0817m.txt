BLACKPOOL, a seaside town of England, in Lancashire, situated on the coast to the north of the estuary of the Ribble, about 20 miles W. of Preston by rail. It is largely frequented as a bathing-place. A good sandy beach, bracing air, and a fine view, are its chief attractions. In the end of last century it was a mere hamlet, but since then it has gradually increased. It has two churches, two markethalls, a court-house, and assembly rooms. The parade affords a fine promenade. A new pier was built in 1866. Population in 1871, 6100.
