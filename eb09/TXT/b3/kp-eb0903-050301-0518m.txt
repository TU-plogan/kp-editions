BEECH, a well-known tree, the Fagus sylvatιca. For the cultivation and properties of it see Arboriculture, vol. ii. p. 317. The name beech is from the Anglo-Saxon boc, bece, or beoce (Ger. Buche, Swedish, bok), words meaning at once a book and a beech-tree. The connection of the beech with the graphic arts is supposed to have originated in the fact that the ancient Runic tablets were formed of thin boards of beech-wood, “The origin of the word,” says Prior {Popular Names of British Plants'), “is identical with that of the Sanskrit bôkô, letter, bôkôs, writings; and this correspondence of the Indian and our own is interesting as evidence of two things, viz., that the Brahmins had the art of writing before they detached themselves from the common stock of the Indo-European race in Upper Asia, and that we and other Germans have received alphabetic signs from the East by a northern route, and not by the Mediterranean.” Beech-mast, the fruit of the beechtree, was formerly known in England as buck; and the county of Buckingham is so named from its fame as a beechgrowing country. Buckwheat {Buclιeιveizen) derives its name from the similarity of its angular seeds to beech-mast. The generic name Fagus is derived from φάγω, to eat; but the φηγός of Theophrastus was probably the sweet chestnut (cesculus) of the Romans. Beech-mast has been used as food in times of distress and famine; and in autumn it yields an abundant supply of food to park-deer and other game, and to pigs, which are turned into beech-woods in order to utilize the fallen mast. In France it is used for feeding pheasants and domestic poultry. Well-ripened beech-mast yields from 17 to 20 per cent, of a non-drying oil, suitable for illumination, and said to be used in some parts of France and other Continental countries in cooking, and as a substitute for butter
