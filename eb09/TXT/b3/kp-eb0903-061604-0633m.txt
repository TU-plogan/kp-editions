BETEL NUT. The name betel is applied to two different plants, which in the East are very closely associated in the purposes to which they are applied. The betel nut is the fruit of the Areca or betel palm, A reca Catechu, and the betel leaf is the produce of the betel vine or pan, Chavica Betel, a plant allied to that which yields black pepper. The areca palm is a graceful tree, which appears to be indigenous over a wide area in the East, including Southern India, Ceylon, Siam, the Malay Archipelago, and the Philippine Islands, in the whole of which it is extensively cultivated. The fruit of the palm is about the size of a small hen’s egg, and within its fibrous rind is the seed or so-called nut, the albumen of which is very hard and has a prettily mottled grey and brown appearance. The chief purpose for which betel nuts are cultivated and collected is for use as a masticatory,—their use in this form being so wide-spread among Oriental nations that it is estimated that one-tenth of the whole human family indulge in betel chewing. For this use the fruits are annually gathered between the months of August and November, before they are quite ripe, and deprived of their husks. They are prepared by boiling in water, cutting up into slices, and drying in the sun, by which treatment the slices assume a dark brown or black colour. When chewed a small piece is wrapped up in a leaf of the betel vine or pan, with a pellet of shell lime or chunam; and in some cases a little cardamom, turmeric, or other aromatic is added. The mastication causes a copious flow of saliva of a brick-red colour, and gives the mouth, lips, and gums of the chewer a repulsive appearance. The habit blackens the teeth, but it is asserted by those addicted to [9:3:617] it that it strengthens the gums, sweetens the breath, and stimulates the digestive organs. Among the Orientals betel is offered on ceremonial visits in the same manner as wine is produced on similar occasions by Europeans. Betel nuts are further used as a source of catechu, which is procured by boiling the nuts in water. The water of the first boiling becomes red and thick, and when this is inspissated after the removal of the nuts it forms a catechu of high astringency and dark colour called in Bombay “Kossa.” The nuts are again boiled, and the inspissated juice of the second decoction yields a weaker catechu of a brown or reddish colour. Betel nuts are used to some extent in the United Kingdom as the source of a charcoal tooth-powder, which, however, has no special virtue, and they are also employed by turners for ornamental purposes, and for coat buttons on account of the beauty of their structure. Recently they have come into repute as a vermifuge, and have been admitted into the Supplement to the British Pharmacopoeia (1874) as a cure for tape-worm. The quantity of betel nuts consumed in the East is enormous. Ceylon alone exports about 70,000 cwt. annually; Travancorehas upwards of a million of trees, the average produce of each being 300 nuts annually, or about 6000 tons in all; Sumatra is little less productive, and the small island of Penang, named from the Malayan name for the tree, is estimated to contain half a million trees. The nuts of other specie3 of Λreca are used by the poorer classes in the East as substitutes for the genuine betel nut.
