BEDDOES, Thomas, a physician and scientific writer, was born at Shiffnall, in Shropshire, 13th April 1760.
[9:3:480]

From his infancy he was remarkable for his love of books. His father, who was a tanner, wished him to follow the same calling; but, mainly through his grandfather’s recognition of his abilities, he was educated for one of the learned professions. After studying at Bridgnorth grammar school and Plymhill, in Staffordshire, he entered, when about sixteen years of age, at Pembroke College, Oxford. There he proved himself an excellent linguist, while especially devoting himself to science. Having taken his bachelor’s degree at twenty-one, he studied at London for the medical profession under Sheldon. In 1783he became master of arts, and in 1784 he removed to Edinburgh, where he remained about three years. In 1784 he published a translation of Spallanzani’s Dissertations on Natural History, and in 1785 produced a translation, with original notes, of Bergman’s Essays on Elective Attractions. He took his degree of doctor of medicine at Oxford in 1786, and, after visiting Paris, where he became acquainted with Lavoisier, was appointed reader in chemistry at Oxford University. His lectures there attracted large and appreciative audiences; but his advocacy of the French Revolution exciting a clamour against him, he resigned his readership in 1792, and took up his abode with a friend at Ketley, in Shropshire. While resident there he published Observations on the Nature of Demonstrative Evidence, in which he maintains that geometry is founded on experiment, and the History of Isaac Jenkins, a story which powerfully exhibits the evils of drunkenness, and of which 40,000 copies are reported to have been sold. He endeavoured for many years subsequently to realize his project of a pneumatic institution, in which the efficacy of certain gases in curing diseases could be tested. While working for this object he was assisted by the father of Maria Edgeworth, Richard Lovell Edgeworth, one of whose daughters became his wife in 1794. He was ultimately enabled, by the liberality of Wedgwood, to establish the proposed institution (1798), and was fortunate in securing as its superintendent Mr (afterwards the famous Sir Humphrey) Davy, who had already given proofs of uncommon endowments, and many of whose discoveries were made in its laboratory. Among the first results of the pneumatic institution was the discovery of the chemical properties of nitrous oxide, in regard to which, as in many other cases, Beddoes showed himself over-sanguine and speculative. The original aim of the institution was gradually abandoned; it became an ordinary sick-hospital, and was relinquished by its projector in the year before his death, which occurred in 1808. Beddoee was aman of great powers aud wide acquirements, which he directed to noble and philanthropic purposes. He strove to effect social good by popularizing medical knowledge, a work for which his vivid imagination and glowing eloquence eminently fitted him. In his manner of theorizing he considerably resembled his contemporary, the once celebrated Erasmus Darwin. Besides the writings mentioned above, he was the author of Political Pamphlets (1795--97), a popular Essay on Consumption (1779), which won the admiration of Kant, an Essay on Fever (1807), and Hygeia, or Essays Moral and Medical (1807). A life of Beddoes by Dr John E. Stock was published in 1810.
