BARANZANO, Jean Antoine, surnamed Redemptus, an eminent natural philosopher and mathematician, was born in Piedmont in 1590, and died at Montargis in 1622. He was a Barnabite monk, and was for a time professor of philosophy and mathematics at Annecy. His principal works are Uranos copia (1617), De Novis Opinionibus Physicis (1619), Campus Philosophicus (1620). He was greatly esteemed by Lord Bacon, with whom he corresponded. Baconâ€™s letter to him (Spedding, Letters and Life of Bacon, vii. 374-6) shows that he thoroughly appreciated the new philosophy, and could see its weak as well as its strong points.
