BERRI, Charles Ferdinand, Due de, younger son of Charles X. of France, was born at Versailles on the 24th Jan. 1778. With his father, then Comte d’Artois, he had to leave France, and for several years served in the army of Condé. He afterwards joined the Russian army, and in 1801 took up his residence in England, where lie remained for thirteen years. During that time he married an English lady, by whom he had two children. The marriage was cancelled for political reasons in 1814, when the duke set out for France. His frank, open manners gained him some favour with his fickle countrymen, which was increased by his marriage in 1816 with the Princess Caroline Ferdinande Louise of Naples. On the 13th of February 1820 he was mortally wounded, when leaving the opera-house with his wife, by a man named Louvel. Seven months after his death the duchess gave birth to a son, who received the title of duke of Bordeaux. She was compelled to follow Charles X. in his retirement from France after July 1830, but it was with the resolution of returning speedily and making an attempt to secure the throne for her son. In April 1832 she landed near Marseilles, but receiving no support, was compelled to make her way towards the ever-loyal districts of La Vendée and Bretagne. Her followers, however, were defeated, and after much suffering, she was betrayed to the Government and imprisoned in the castle of Blaye. Here she gave birth to a son, the fruit of a secret marriage contracted with an Italian nobleman, son of the Marchese Lucchesi Palli. The announcement of this marriage at once deprived the duchess of the sympathies of her supporters. She was no longer an object of fear to the French Government, who released her in June 1833. She set sail for Sicily, and from that time till her death in April 1870 lived a retired life with her husband and his relatives.
