BIAS, a native of Priene, one of the seven sages of Greece, was the son of Teutamus, and flourished about the middle of the 6th century b.c. He was one of the most eloquent speakers of his time, and is celebrated as having never used his talents for purposes of mere gain, but as having devoted them to the service of the injured and oppressed. Many stories are told illustrative of the nobility of his character in this and other respects. According to one of these, when his native town was taken by an enemy, and the inhabitants were carrying off whatever seemed to each most valuable, one of them, observing Bias without any burden, advised him to follow his example. “I am doing so,” said he, “for I carry all my valuables with me.” His fellow-citizens honoured him with a splendid funeral, and dedicated to him a sanctuary which they called Teutamium. He is said to have written an heroic poem on the affairs of the Ionians, in order to show them how they might be most prosperous. A great number of the short, pithy, ethical sayings or apophthegms characteristic of the Greek sages are ascribed to Bias. Of these a few specimens may be given—“Be slow to enter on an undertaking, but when you have begun, persevere to the end;” “Know, and then act;” “Hear much, speak little ;” “Do not praise an unworthy man on account of his wealth ;” “Take (i,e., gain your end) by persuasion, not by force ;” “He is unfortunate who cannot bear misfortune ;” “So order your affairs as if your life were to be both long and short.” Bias is the author of the famous and often imitated reproof to the impious sailors, who in the midst of a tempest were calling on the gods—“Be quiet,” said he, “lest the gods discover that you are here.” (Diog. Laert., i. 82-88; Stobaeus, Florii. ; Mullach, Frag. Ph. Groec., i. 203, sqq.)
