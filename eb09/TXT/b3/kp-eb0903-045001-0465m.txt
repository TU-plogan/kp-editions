BAUTAIN ", Louis Eugène Marie, a French philosopher and theologian, was born at Paris in February 1796, and died in October 1867 At the École Normale he came under the influence of Cousin, whose views on most philosophic points he at first accepted. In 1816 he adopted the profession of higher teaching, and was soon after called to the chair of philosophy in the University of Strasburg. He continued in this position for many years, delivering a parallel course of lectures as professor of the literary faculty in the same city. The strong reaction against merely speculative philosophy, which carried away such men as De Maistre and De Lamennais, was not without influence on Bautain. In 1828 he took orders, and resigned his chair at the university. For several years he remained at Strasburg, lecturing at the Faculty and at the College of Juilly; but in 1849 he set out for Paris as vicar of the diocese. At Paris he obtained considerable reputation as an orator, and in 1853 was made professor of moral theology at the theological faculty. This post he held till his death. Bautain is rather a scholastic than a modern philosopher. His view of the relation between reason and faith is essentially the same as that of Anselm and his great successors. Revelation is supposed to give materials which could not otherwise have been attained by the human mind, and philosophy supplies the scientific exposition or evolution of these facts. Theology and philosophy thus form one comprehensive science; yet the system is far removed from Rationalism. Bautain in fact, like Pascal, Newman, and others, depreciates reason in order to exalt faith. He points out, following chiefly the Kantian criticism, that reason is limited in application, and can never yield knowedge of things as they are in themselves. But in addition to reason, we have, according to him, another faculty which may be called Intelligence, and through which we are put in connection with the world of spiritual and invisible truth. This intelligence does not of itself yield a body of truth; it merely contains the germs of the higher ideas, and these seeds are made productive by being brought into contact with revealed facts. This fundamental conception Bautain works out in detail in the departments of psychology and morals. His works, to which we can only refer, are well deserving of attention. The most important of them are— Philosophie du Christianisme, 1833; Psychologic Expérimentale, 1839 (new edition entitled Esprit Humain et ses Facultés, 1859); Philosophie Morale, 1842; Religion et Liberté, 1848; La Morale de Γ Evangile comparée aux divers systèmes de Morale, 1855.
