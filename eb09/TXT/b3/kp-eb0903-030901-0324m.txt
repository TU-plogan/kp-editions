BÄNDÄ, a district of British India, in the Allâhâbâd division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of the NorthWestern Provinces, lies between 24° 59' 15* and 25° 55' 30* N. lat., and 80° 2' 45* and 81° 38' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the district of Fathipur, from which it is separated by the River Jamnâ; on the N.E. by the districts of Fathipur and Allâhâbâd; on the S.E. by the native state of Riwâ; on the S. and S.W. by some of the petty states of Bundelkhand; and on the W. and N.W. by the district of Ξamirpur. Area, 3030 square miles, of which 1390 are under cultivation, 848 cultivable but not cultivated, 108 revenue free, and 684 uncultivable waste. The census of 1872 took the area at 2908 - 68 square miles, and returned the district population at 697,610 souls,— viz., Hindus, 657,107; Mahometans, 40,497; Christians, 6. Average density, 230 persons to the square mile. Of the population in 1872, 2897 were landed proprietors, 42,230 agriculturists, and 63,644 non-agriculturists. In some parts the district rises into irregular uplands and elevated plains, interspersed with detached rocks of granite; in others it sinks into marshy lowlands, which frequently remain under water during the rainy season. The sloping countιy on the bank of the Jamnâ is full of ravines. To the S.E. the Vindhya chain of hills takes its origin in a low range not exceeding 500 feet in height, and forming a natural boundary of the district in that direction. The principal river of the district is the Jamnâ, which flows from northwest to south-east, along the N.E. boundary of the district for 125 miles. Its most important tributaries within the district are the Ken, Bâgain, Paisuni, and Ohân, all of which take their rise in the Vindhya hills. The principal towns and market villages in the district are Mau, Mâjhgâon or Râjâpur, Markâ, Samgarâ, Augâsi, Chillâ, and Barâgâon, all situated on the bank of the Jamnâ.

The black soil of the district yields abundant crops of wheat, barley, maize, millet of various sorts, rice, and pulses. Hemp, oil-seeds, sugar, and indigo are also grown, but by far the most important crop is cotton, for which the district is so celebrated that the produce is distinguished in commerce as “Banda Cotton.” The estimated acreage under the principal crops—Gram (Cicer arietinum), 138,662 acres; wheat, 134,247; maize, 126,198; cotton, 69,667; barley, 60,976; rice, 20,987; total, 550,737 acres, or 860 - 52 square miles. The total cultivated area of the district is returned at 1390 square miles. The manufactures of Banda consist of coarse cottoncloth, sackcloth, and stone handles for knives. Iron and building stone form the only mineral products. The revenue of the district amounted in 1870-71 to £167,488, the expenditure being £63,425 Since the acquisition of the country by the British, eight settlements of the land revenue have been made at different periods. The last (1834-35) of these adjusted the demand at £134,904, and the total collections amounted in 1870-71 to £131,275. In 1871 the regular police force of 620 men was maintained at a cost of £8920, while a rural constabulary of 2552 men was maintained at the cost of the landholders and villagers. In 1871-72 there were 214 schools in the district, with an average daily attendance of 4695 pupils; expenditure, £2194, of which Government paid £754. Banda district has only two towns containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants, viz., Banda (27,746) and Girwân (6670). Banda, the headquarters of the district, lies cn the right bank of the River Ken, in lat. 25° 28', long. 80° 23'. Thirty-six miles of the Jalalpur branch of the East Indian Railway lie within the district, and eleven first-class roads afford good means of communication— the most important road, both commercially and for military purposes, being that from Mânikpur to Chillâ. The climate of Banda is cold in the winter months, and terribly hot in summer. Frost is rare, except in the moist land adjoining the rivers; the hot winds frequently cause deaths among the natives from exposure to the mid-day heat. Rainfall in 1870-71, 51 - 3 inches.

Banda has formed an arena of contention for the successive races who have struggled for the sovereignty of India. Kalinjar town, then the capital, was unsuccessfully besieged by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1023 a.d. ; in 1196 it was taken by Kutab-ud-din, the general of Muhammad Ghori; in 1545 by Sher Shah, who, however, fell mortally wounded in the assault. About the year 1735 the Râjâ of Kalinjar’s territory, including the present district of Banda, was bequeathed to Bâji Râo, the Marhattâ Peshwâ; and from the Marhattas it passed by the treaties of 1802-3 to the Company.
