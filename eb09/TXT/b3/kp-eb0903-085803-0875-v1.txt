BOGOMILI, a heretical sect of the Greek Church, who came into notice during the 12th century. In origin they are probably Bulgarian, and their name appears to be a compound of the Slavonic words Bog, God, and milui, have mercy In doctrine they are closely assimilated to the Euchites of the preceding century, and they may be looked on as an offshoot of that older sect. The peculiarity of their system of belief is the place assigned to Satan, who, under his original name Satanael, is held by them to be the first-born son of God But Satanael, though seated at the right hand of his father and endowed with universal sway, was discontented and desired to become independent. IIe led away a section of the angels from their allegiance, and with their aid formed out of chaos a new world—the earth, and a new race—man. But he was unable to give to man a portion of his own living spirit, and therefore besought God to bestow life on this new creation, promising that the vacant places of the seceded angels should be filled up by the spirits of men. Repenting of this promise, however, he resolved to bring forth an evil race which should overwhelm the good among mankind. He accordingly seduced Eve, who gave birth to Cain, the first of the descendants of the evil principle. His power also enabled him to deceive the greater part of mankind, particularly the Jews, to whom he represented himself as Jehovah. At last God sent out from himself the Logos, or angel Michael, who came upon earth in an ethereal form which was in appearance only an earthly body. Christ overcame Satanael, and deprived him of his creative power, El, from which time he is called Satan. Christ then ascended and took his place beside the Father, who again sent forth an emanation, the Holy Ghost, for the comfort and edification of believers. In church observances the Bogomili were equally heterodox. They rejected baptism by water only, and made the cere mony consist of prayer, and of laying on the head of the convert the gospel (probably apocryphal) of St John, and the hands of the congregation. As they rejected the symbol of water in baptism so they refused to admit such symbolic rites as the Lord’s supper, which they looked upon as an offering to evil spirits. They were averse to all images, even to the cross. The Bogomili suffered persecution from Alexius Comnenus, who put to death their leader Basilius, and they were condemned by a synod of Constantinople in 1140. They lingered on, however, in and about Philippopolis, and opinions nearly identical with theirs are to be met with among the later Catharists. (See the Church Histories of Neander and Gieseler.)
