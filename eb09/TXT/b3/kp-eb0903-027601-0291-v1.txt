BALDUS, an eminent professor of the civil law, and also of the canon law, in the university of Perugia. He came of the noble family of the Ubaldi; and his two brothers, Angelus de Ubaldis and Petrus de Ubaldis, were almost of equal eminence with himself as jurists. He was born in 1327, and studied civil law under Bartolus at Perugia, where he was admitted to the degree of doctor of civil law at the early age of seventeen in 1344. Fredericus Petrucius of Siena is said to have been the master under whom he studied canon law. Upon his promotion to the doctorate he at once proceeded to Bologna, where he taught law for three years; after which he was advanced to a professorial chair at Perugia, which he occupied for thirty-three years. He taught law subsequently at Pisa, at Florence, at Padua, and at Pavia, at a time when the schools of law in those universities disputed the palm with the school of Bologna. Baldus has not left behind him any works which bear out the great reputation which he acquired amongst his contemporaries. This circumstance may be in some respects accounted for by the active part which he took in public affairs, and by the fame which he acquired by his consultations, of which five volumes have been published by Diplovataccius. Baldus was the master of Peter Beaufort, the nephew of Pope Clement VI., who became himself Pope under the title of Gregory XI., and whose immediate successor, Urban VI., summoned Baldus to Rome to assist him by his consultations against the anti-pope Clement VII. Cardinal de Zabarella and Paulus de Castro were also amongst his pupils. His Commentary on the Liber Fendorum is considered to be one of the best of his works, which have been unfortunately left by him for the most part in an incomplete state.
