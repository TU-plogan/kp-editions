BAILEY, or Baily, Nathanael or Nathan, an eminent English philologist and lexicographer, whose Etymological English Dictionary, published apparently in 1721, was a great improvement on all previous vocabularies, and really formed the basis of Johnsonâ€™s great work. It is still worthy of being consulted for information with regard to the change of signification in certain words, and to the date at which others were introduced into the language. Bailey had a school at Stepney, near London, and was the author of Dictionarium Domesticum and several other educational works. He died in 1742.
