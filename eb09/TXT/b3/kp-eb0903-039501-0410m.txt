BARROS, Joao de, a celebrated Portuguese historian, was born about 1496, and died in 1570. In 1522 he was appointed governor of St George del Mina, on the coast of Guinea. Three years after, the king recalled him to court, and made him treasurer of the Indies. This appointment furnished him with the materials necessary for the composition of his valuable history, entitled Asia Portuguesa, the first decade of which he published in 1552, the second in 1553, and the third in 1563; the fourth was not published till 1615. Several authorshave continued the work, so that it extends to twelve decades. The best edition is that published at Lisbon, in 1778, in 9 vols. 8vo.
