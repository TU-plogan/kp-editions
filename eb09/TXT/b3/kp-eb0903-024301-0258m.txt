BAILLIE, Joanna, poet and dramatist, was born at the manse of Bothwell, on the banks of the Clyde (Scotland), in 1762. At an early period of her life she removed with her sister Agnes to London, where their brother, the celebrated Dr Matthew Baillie, was settled. The two sisters were left a small competence by their uncle, Dr William Hunter, and took up their residence at Hampstead, on the outskirts of London, where they passed the remainder of their lives. Miss Baillie died on the 23d Feb. 1851, at the advanced age of 89, her faculties remaining unimpaired to the last. Her gentleness and sweetness of disposition made her a universal favourite, and her little cottage at Hampstead was the centre of a brilliant literary society. Miss Baillie had received' an excellent education, and probably cultivated very early her faculty of poetical composition, but it was not till 1798 that she published the first volume of her Plays on the Passions. Her design, founded on a careful study of the nature of dramatic poetry, was to illustrate each of the deepest and strongest passions of the human mind, such as Hate, Jealousy, Fear, Love, by a tragedy and a comedy, in each of which should be exhibited the actions of an individual under the influence of these passions. The success of the first volume was very considerable, and a second edition was soon called for. A second volume followed in 1802, a third in 1812, and three more in 1836. Some miscellaneous dramas were published in 1804, and the Family Legend appeared in 1810. Miss Baillie herself intended her plays not for the closet but for the stage. The Family Legend, brought out at Edinburgh under the enthusiastic patronage of Sir Walter Scott, had a brief though brilliant success; De Monfort had a short run in London, mainly through the acting of Kemble and Mrs Siddons; Henriquez and The Separation were coldly received. The popular verdict has thus been given against the dramas as good stage plays, and the almost universal decision of readers has confirmed this judgment. With very few exceptions, they are unsuited for stage exhibition. Not only is there a flaw in the fundamental idea, that, viz., of an individual who is the embodiment of a single passion, but there is a want of incident, and a narrowness, consequent upon the attention being too much directed on a single point, that present insuperable obstacles to their success as acting pieces. The plot is generally well constructed, but the very consciousness of aim with which it is wrought out gives to the whole a morbid and unnatural aspect; there is rarely, if ever, any progress in the play; the whole is apparent from the outset, and the action never heightens the spectators’ interest. It must be confessed, also, that Miss Baillie had no very adequate notion of what is required in a stage drama, and that her experience was too limited. This is apparent in her comedies, which are very inferior productions. In short, her want of success is a clear proof of the impracticability of that analytic or psychological method, which she expounds and defends in her preliminary dissertations. The plays, however, are admirably adapted for reading; they show remarkable powers of analysis and acute observation, and are written in a pure and vigorous style, rising occasionally into strains of high poetic feeling and expression. The best of the tragedies are undoubtedly Henriquez, The Separation, De Monfort, and Count Basil, the first of which might perhaps be made into a good acting play. Miss Baillie’s reputation does not rest entirely on her dramas: she is the authoress of some poetical pieces and songs of great beauty, and in all probability great portion of her .fame will be found to rest on these minor works. The best of them are the Innes to Agnes Baillie on her Birthday, The Kitten, To a Child, and some of her adaptations of Scotch songe, such as Woo'd and Married ari a’. Scattered throughout the dramas are also some lively and beautiful songs, such, e.g., as the Chough and the Crow in Orra, the lover’s song in the Phantom, beginning—
“I’ve seen the moon gleam through the cave,
And minute drops like diamonds glancing.”

And the sailor’s song—
“0 swiftly glides the bonny boat
Just parted from the shore.”
(See Joanna Baillie ’s Dramatic and Poetical Works, Lond. 1851, 1 vol.)
