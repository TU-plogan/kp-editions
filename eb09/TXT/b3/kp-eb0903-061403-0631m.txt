Besançon is a place of great antiquity Under the name of Vesεntio, it wa3, in the time of Caesar, the chief town of the Sequani. Under the Romm emperors it was rich and prosperous, and Aurelian especially had a great liking for the place. Many of the streets still bear the old Roman names. It was frequently destroyed and rebuilt during the Middle Ages, and the present city stands twenty feet above the original level. In the 12th century it passed with the rest of Franche-Comté to the German empire, and was made a free city by Frederick I. In 1584, Granvilla, the minister of Charles V. became archbishop of the see, and afterwards founded a university in the town, which existed till the Revolution. By the treaty of Westphalia, Besançon was made over to Spain, and many traces of Spanish occupation still remain. In 1660 Louis XIV. besieged it in person, ana it was assigned to France by the peace of Nimeguen. In 1814 and 1815 it was invested and bombarded by the allies; and in the war of 1870-71 it formed an important position in the movements of the French army.
