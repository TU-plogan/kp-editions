BAMBOUK, a country in the interior of Western Africa, situated between the Senegal and its tributary the Falerne, and extending from lat. 12° 30' to 14° N., and from long. 10° to 12° 30' W. It is traversed from N.W. to S.E. by the steep and wall-like range of the Tamba-Ura Mountains. The soil in a large part of the country is of remarkable fertility; rice, maize, millet, melons, manioc, grapes, bananas, and other fruits, grow almost without cultivation; the forests are rich in a variety of valuable trees; and extensive stretches are covered with abundant pasturage of the long guinea-grass. As a∙ natural consequence there is great profusion of animal life. The inhabitants, a branch of the Mandingo race, have made but little progress in civilization. The one product of their country which really excites them to labour is gold; and even it is so common and accessible that the rudest methods of collection are deemed sufficient. The most remarkable deposit is at Natakoo, where a considerable hill seems to be wholly composed of auriferous strata. There is also a good mine at Kenieba. In exchange for the gold, cloth, ornaments, and salt—the last a most valuable article—are imported. The usual beast of burden is the ass, the horse being only possessed by the very wealthiest in the country. Sheep and cattle are both pretty numerous. Unfortunately, the climate is very unhealthy, especially in the rainy season, which lasts for about four months, from July or August. The chief towns are Bambouk, Salaba, and Konkuba. The Portuguese early penetrated into Bambouk, and were even for some time masters of the country; but the inhabitants made a general rising and completely drove them out. Remains of their buildings, however, are still to be seen. The French, soon after they had formed their settlement on the Senegal, turned their attention to this land of gold. It was not till 1716, however, that Compagnon, under the auspices of De la Brue, the governor of Senegal, succeeded, by great [9:3:307] address, and not without risk, in visiting various parts of the auriferous region; and his explorations were followed up by David, Levens, and others. Raffenel visited the country in 1844, and Pascal, a naval lieutenant, was there in 1859. A few commercial stations or comptoirs have recently been established.
