BALMEZ, Jaime Lucien, a Spanish ecclesiastic, eminent as a political writer and a philosopher, was born at Vich in Catalonia, on the 28th August 1810, and died there on the 9th July 1848. The most important of his works, and that on which his fame principally rests, is entitled El Protestant ismo compar ado con el Catolicismo en sus rela-ciones con la Civilisacion Europea, published 1842-44, a most able defence of Catholicism. It has been translated into French, Italian, German, and English. The best of his philosophical works, which are able expositions of the old scholastic system of thought, are the Filosofia F on-damental, 1846, and the Corso de Filosofia Elemental, 4 vols. 1847. The Protestantism and Catholicity and the Fundamental Philosophy have both been translated into English (1849, 2 vols. 1857). Nearly all the works are to be had in German and French.
