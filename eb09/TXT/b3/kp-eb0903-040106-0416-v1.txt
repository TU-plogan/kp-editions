BARTHÉLEMY, Auguste Marseille, a French satirical poet, was born at Marseilles in 1796, and died in 1867. After having established some local reputation as a poet he went to Paris, where by one of his first efforts, Le Sacre de Charles X., 1825, he gained the favour of the court. His energies, however, were soon enlisted in the service of the opposition party. In 1826 appeared the clever political satire, Le Villèliade, a mock heroic poem, the joint production of Barthélemy and his constant friend Méry, also a native of Marseilles. The success was immediate and pronounced; fifteen editions were called for during the year, and the authors cleared nearly £1000. A rapid succession of political squibs and satires was now poured forth by the ,authors, one of the most remarkable being Napoleon en Egypte, 1828, which passed through nearly a dozen editions in a year. In 1829 Barthélemy had become so offensive to the Government that he was imprisoned and find 1000 francs. The Revolution of 1830 liberated him; and in company with Méry, he celebrated the triumph of the people in one of their most brilliant efforts, L’Insurrection. During the next two years Barthélemy, though enjoying for a time a pension from Louis Philippe, did not cease his attacks on the Government and its ministers. In 1832, however, he made a curious change, the motive for which is not clear, but the effect of which was seriously to impair, almost to destroy his influence. In that year he published an anonymous poem, supporting some acts of the Government which were peculiarly obnoxious to the Liberal party, and, on the work being attacked, defended it openly. For the next few years he enjoyed a handsome pension from the Government, and refrained from all satirical writing. He again resumed his old style in 1844, but without the former success. From that date he contented himself with merely occasional poems. ,
