BASTIA, a fortified town and seaport on the eastern coast of the island of Corsica, and the capital of an arrondissement. Lat. 42° 41' 36" N., long. 9° 27' 22" E. It occupies a very picturesque situation, rising from the sea in the form of an amphitheatre; but the town itself is ill-built, and the streets are narrow and crooked. The harbour, which is defended by a citadel, has a narrow and difficult entrance. Bastia is the seat of a royal court for the island, and of tribunals of commerce and primary jurisdiction, and has a theatre, a military and a civil hospital, a communal college, a model school, a museum, and a library of 30,000 volumes. Its principal manufactures are soap, leather, liqueurs, and wax; and it exports oil, wine, coral, and various other products, being the principal seat of the import and export trade of the island. Bastia dates from the building of the Genoese Castle by Lionello Lomellino in 1383, and derives its name from the Bastion of St Charles. Under the Genoese it was long the principal stronghold in the north of the island, and the residence of the governor; and, in 1553, it was the first town attacked by the French. On the division of the island in 1797 into the two departments of Golo and Liamone, Bastia remained the capital of the former; but when the two were again united Ajaccio obtained the superiority. The city was taken by the English in 1745, and again in 1794. Population, 21,535. (See view in Lear’s Jour, in Corsica, 1870.)
