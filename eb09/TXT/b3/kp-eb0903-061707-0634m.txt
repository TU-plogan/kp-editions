BETTERTON, Thomas, the best English actor of his time, was the son of Mr Betterton, under-cook to King Charles L, and was born at Westminster in 1635. He was apprenticed to Mr Rhodes, a bookseller near Charing Cross. Rhodes, who had been wardrobe-keeper to the theatre in Blackfriars, obtained in 1659 a licence to set up a company of players at the Cockpit in Drury Lane; and there Betteιton made his first appearance on the stage. On the opening of the new theatre in Lincoln’s-Jnn-Fields in 1662, Sir William Davenant, the patentee, engaged Betterton and all Rhodes’s company to play in his Siege of [9:3:618] Rhodes. Betterton became a great favourite with the king, and was sent to Paris to examine the French stage, with a view to the introduction of improvements. According to Cibber it was after his return that shifting scenes were first used in the English theatre instead of tapestry. In 1670 Betterton married Mrs Sanderson, a good actress of the same company; and the marriage was a very happy one. In 1693, when he had just lost the little money he had laid by, he was enabled by the aid of his friends to erect a new playhouse in the Tennis Court in Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields. It was opened in 1695 with Congreve’s Love for Love. But in a few years the profits greatly fell off; and Betterton, iufirm through age, and labouring under violent attacks of the gout, determined to quit the stage. On his retirement the public gave him a benefit-night, when, though upwards of seventy, he played the part of Valentine iu the comedy of Loυe for Love : the profits are said to have amounted to upwards of £500. His performance of Hamlet after this time is particularly mentioned in the Toiler. In the spring of 1710 he made his last appearance on the stage in his celebrated part of Melantius in The Maid's Tragedy. A rash attempt to reduce the swelling of his limbs by external applications threw the gout into his head, and he died on the 28th of April. His body was interred with much ceremony in the cloisters of Westminster. Betterton was author of several dramatic works which were popular in their day. An estimate of his character and abilities is given in the Apology for my Own Life, <fcc., of his friend and rival Colley Cibber.
