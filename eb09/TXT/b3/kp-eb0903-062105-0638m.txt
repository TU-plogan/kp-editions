BEVERLEY, John of, a celebrated prelate, who flourished during the 7th and 8th centuries, was born at Harpham in Northumbria. He received his education at Canterbury, and after his return to the north was the instructor of the Venerable Bede. In 685 he was made bishop of Hagolstad or Hexham, and two years later was promoted to the archbishopric of York. He resigned his see in 717, and retired to a college which he had founded some years before at Beverley, where he died in 721. He was celebrated for his scholarship as well as for his virtues. The following works are ascribed to him :â€” Pro Luca Exponendo (an exposition of Luke); Homilioe in Evangelia ; Epistolae ad Herebaldum, Audenam, et Bertinvm; Epistolae ad Holdam abbatissam.
