BAYARD, Pierre du Terrail, Chevalier de, was born, of a noble family, at the chateau Bayard, Dauphiné, in 1476. He served as a page to the duke of Savoy until Charles VIII., attracted by his graceful bearing, placed him among the royal followers under the count de Ligny. As a youth he was distinguished for comeliness, affability of manner, and skill in the tilt-yard. In 1494 he accompanied Charles VIII. into Italy, and was knighted after the battle of Fornova, where he had captured a standard. Shortly afterwards, entering Milan alone in pursuit of the enemy, he was taken prisoner, but w as set free without a ransom by Ludovic Sforza. His powers and daring were conspicuous in the Italian wars of this period. On one occasion it is said that, single-handed, he made good the defence of a bridge over the Garigliano against about 200 Spaniards, an exploit that brought him such renown that Pope Julius II. sought to entice him into the Papal service, but unsuccessfully. The captaincy of a company in the royal service was’given him in 1508, and the following year he led a storming party at the siege of Brescia. Here his intrepidity in first mounting the rampart cost him a severe wound, which obliged his soldiers to carry him into a neighbouring house, the residence of a nobleman, whose wife and daughters he protected from threatened insult. On his recovery he declined a gift of 2500 ducats, with which they sought to reward him. At this time his general was the celebrated Gaston de Foix, who acted greatly in accordance with his advice, and, indeed, fell at the battle of Ravenna through neglecting it. In 1513, when Henry VIII. of England routed the French at the battle of the Spurs, Bayard, in trying to rally his countrymen, found his escape cut off. Suddenly riding up to an English officer who was resting unarmed, he summoned him to yield, and the knight complying, Bayard in return gave himself up to his prisoner. He was taken into the English camp, but on relating this gallant incident was immediately set free by the king without ransom. On the accession of Francis I. in 1515 he was made lieutenant-general of Dauphiné; and after the victory of Marignano, to which his valour largely contributed, he had the honour of conferring knighthood on his youthful sovereign. When war again broke out between Francis I. and Charles V., Bayard, with 1000 men, held Mézières, a town which had been declared untenable, against an army of 35,000, and after six weeks compelled Nassau to raise the siege. This stubborn resistance saved Central France from invasion, as the king had not then sufficient forces to withstand the imperialists. All France rang with the achievement. Parliament thanked Bayard as the saviour of his country; the king made him a knight of the order of St Michael, and commander in his own name of 100 gens d’armes, an honour till then reserved for princes of the blood. After allaying a revolt at Genoa, and striving with the greatest assiduity to check a pestilence in Dauphiné, Bayard was sent, in 1523, into Italy with Admiral Bonivet, who, being defeated at Rebec, implored him to assume the command and save the army. He repulsed the foremost pursuers, but in guarding the rear at the passage of the Sesia was mortally wounded. He had himself placed against a tree that he might die facing the [9:3:458] enemy, and to Bourbon, who camo up and expressed pity for him, he replied, “My lord, I thank you, but pity is not for me, who die a true man, serving my king; pity is for you who bear arms against your prince, your country, and your oath.” He expired after repeating the Miserere. His body was restored to his friends and interred near Grenoble. Chivalry, deprived of fantastic extravagance, is perfectly mirrored in the character of Bayard. He combined the merits of a skilful tactician with the romantic heroism, piety, and magnanimity of the ideal knight-errant. Even adversaries experienced the fascination of his virtues, and joined in the sentiment that he was, as his contemporaries called him, “Le chevalier sans peur et sans reproche.” (Cf. Walford’s Chevalier Bayard.)
