BARNES, Joshua, an English scholar, born in 1654. In 1695 he was chosen queen’s professor of Greek, a language which he wrote and spoke with the utmost facility. One of his first publications was a whimsical tract, entitled Gerania, or a New Discovery of the Little Sort of People called Pygmies. Among his other works are a Life of Edward III., in which he introduces his hero making long and elaborate speeches; Sacred Poems; the Life of Oliver Cromwell the Tyrant; some dramatic pieces; a poetical paraphrase on the history of Esther, in Greek verse, with a Latin translation, &c. He also published editions of Euripides, Anacreon, and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey, with notes and a Latin translation. He died in 1712.
