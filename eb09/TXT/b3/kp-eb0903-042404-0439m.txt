BASSANO, a city of Italy in the province of Vicenza. It stands on the river Brenta, over which there is a bridge 180 feet in length, built by Palladio. It is surrounded with walls, and has six gates, one of which, also by Palladio, is very much admired. In the centre of the town is the tower of Ezzelino, which now contains a library and armoury. The town contains thirty-five churches (some of them with fine paintings), several religious houses, and other public edifices. It has extensive silk-mills, besides manufactures of cloth, paper, straw hats, copper wares, &c.; and the printing establishment of S. Remondini is one of the most extensive in Italy. In 1796 Bonaparte defeated the Austrian general Wurmser in the neighbourhood, and various skirmishes took place between the two forces in 1801, 1805, 1813. Maret derived from the town his title of duke of Bassauo. Population, 13,254.
