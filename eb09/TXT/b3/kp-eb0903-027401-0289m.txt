BALBRIGGAN, a seaport of Ireland, in the county of Dublin and parish of Balrothery, 18∣ miles N.N.E. of the capital. The harbour, though dry at low tides, has a depth of 14 feet at high-water springs, and affords a good refuge from the E. or S.E. gales. It is formed by a pier 600 feet long, with a lighthouse at its extremity, in 53° 37' N. lat., 6° 12' W. long. A viaduct of eleven arches crosses the harbour. The town has considerable manufactures of cottons and hosiery, and is much frequented as a watering-place in summer. Population in 1871, 2332.
