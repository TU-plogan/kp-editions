BENJAMIN (ΓP*}2, Sept. Bενιαμίν), the youngest son of the patriarch Jacob, by Rachel. His mother, dying in childbed, gave him the name Benoni, “Son of my pain,” which was changed by his father to Benjamin, meaning probably “Son of the right hand,” that is, “Son of prosperity” (Gen. XXXV. 16-18). Of his personal history little is recorded. He was the favourite of his father and brothers, and seems to have been of an amiable though somewhat weak character. In this respect he strikingly contrasts with the tribe, whose history was foretold in the dying prophecy of Jacob, “Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf” (Gen. xlix. 27). The tribe of Benjamin, though the least numerous of Israel, became nevertheless a considerable race. In the desert it counted 35,400 warriors (Num. i. 37), and at the entrance of Israel into Canaan even as many as 45,600 (Num. xxvi. 41). The portion allotted to this tribe was encompassed by the districts of Ephraim, Dan, and Judah. In the time of the judges the tribe of Benjamin became involved in a civil war with the other eleven tribes, which terminated in its almost utter extinction, -600 men alone escaping (Judges xix., xx.) The tribe speedily revived, however; in the time of David it numbered 59,434 able warriors, and in that of Asa, 280,000. This tribe had the honour of giving the first king to the Jews, Saul being a Benjamite. After the death of Saul, the Benjamites declared themselves for his son Ishbosheth, until, after the assassination of that prince, David became king of all Israel. David having expelled the Jebusites from Zion, and made it his own residence, the close alliance that previously existed between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah was cemented by the circumstance that, while Jerusalem belonged to the district of Benjamin, that of Judah was immediately contiguous to it. At the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon, Benjamin espoused the cause of Judah, and they formed a kingdom by themselves. Indeed, the two tribes stood always in such a close connection as often to be included under the single name Judah.

> BENJAMIN, of Tudela, in Navarre, a celebrated Jewish rabbi of the 12th century, whose Itinerary is a literary curiosity. He visited Constantinople, Egypt, Assyria, and Persia, penetrating to the frontiers of China. He was credulous, but his work contains some curious notices of the countries he visited. It was translated from the Hebrew into Latin by Arias Montanus in 1575, and appeared in a French version by Baratier in 1734, and again in 1830. The latest English translation is that by Asher, 1840.
