BALTA, the chief town of a circle of the same name in the Russian government of Podolia. It stands on the Kodima, near its junction with the Bug, and carries on a large trade in cattle and horses and the raw products of the surrounding district. It has two great annual fairs, the more important being held at Whitsuntide and the other in June. A variety of industries, such as tallow-melting, soap-boiling, tile-making, and brewing are likewise prosecuted. The Jews form a very considerable part of the population, which in 1867 numbered 14,528. Balta was in great part destroyed by the Russians in 1780.
