BEULÉ, Charles Ernest, a French archaeologist and man of letters, was born at Saumur 29 th June 1826, and died 4th April 1874. He was educated at the Ecole Normale, and in 1852 was sent to Athens as one of the professors in the École Française established there. At first distinguished as a man of fashion, he afterwards devoted himself with intense vigour to archaeological researches. He had the good fortune to discover the propyhea of the Acropolis, and his work, L , Acropole d’Athènes (2 vols. 1854), was published by order of the minister of public instruction. Promotion and distinctions followed rapidly upon his first successes. He was made doctor of letters, chevalier of the Legion of Honour, professor of archaeology at the Bibliothèque Impériale, member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and perpetual secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts. Like too many French men of letters, he joined eagerly in political affairs, with which the last few years of his life were entirely occupied. The most important of his writings are Etudes sur le Péloponnèse, 1855; Les Monnaies d'Athènes, 1858; Histoire de la Sculpture avant Phidias, 1864; Histoire de l’Art Grec, 1870.
