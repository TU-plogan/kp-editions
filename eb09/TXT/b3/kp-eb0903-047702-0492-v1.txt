BECCARIA, Giovanni Battista, a distinguished electrician and practical astronomer, was born at Mondovi on the 2d of October 1716, and entered the religious order of the Pious Schools in 1732. He became professor of experimental physics, first at Palermo and then at Rome, and was appointed to a similar situation at Turin in 1748. ∏e was afterwards made tutor to the young princes de Chablais and de Carignan, and continued to reside principally at Turin during the remainder of his life. In May 1755 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of London, to which he afterwards communicated several papers relating to his favourite pursuits. He died on the 27th of May 1781. Beccaria’s name is associated with no great discovery in physical science; but he did much, both in the way of experiment and exposition, to spread abroad the researches of Franklin and others in the science of electricity. His own experiments, which were skilfully conducted, demonstrated a number of curious facts bearing on the relations of electricity to meteorological phenomena, to chemical action, and to some other points which have been since more thoroughly investigated. His principal work was the treatise DeW Elettricismo Artificiale e Naher ale, 1753, which was translated into English in 1776. He also contributed a number of papers to the Philosophical Transactions. In 1759 he was commissioned to measure an arc of the meridian in the neighbourhood of Turin. The result, which he published in the Gradus Taurinensis, 1774, is not now considered perfectly correct.
