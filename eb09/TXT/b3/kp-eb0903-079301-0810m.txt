BITONTO, a city and bishopâ€™s see, in the province of Bari, in South Italy, on the great road from Foggia to Bari, about 12 miles from the latter town. Its cathedral, dedicated to St Valentine, is a fine building in the Italo-Gothic style; and it possesses a theological seminary, a large orphan asylum, and a hospital. The inhabitants maintain an active trade, and have extensive manufactures of olive oil. Their principal export is an excellent wine known as Zagarelle. Bitonto, or Butuntum, seems from its coins to have been a place of some importance at an early period, but it makes no appearance in ancient history. In the Middle Ages its Accadenda degl' Infiammati obtained [9:3:794] considerable fame. In 1735 it wa3 the scene of a severe battle, in which the Austrians were defeated by the Spaniards under Mortemar, in whose honour Philip V. caused a pyramid to be erected on the spot. Population in 1871, 24,978.
