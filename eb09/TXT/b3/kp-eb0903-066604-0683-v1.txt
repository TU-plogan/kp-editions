BIEL, Gabriel, frequently but erroneously styled the last of the scholastics, was born at Spire about the middle of the 15th century. He held for some time a pastoral charge at Mainz, and afterwards removed to Urach. On the foundation of the University of Tiibingen in 1477 he was appointed to the professorship of theology, and was twice afterwards promoted to the dignity of rector. Some years before his death, in 1495, he entered a religious fraternity. Biel was a follower of William of Occam, and professes only to develop systematically the principles of his master. His great work, Collectorium super Libros Sententiarum G. 0ccami (1508, 1512, and various dates), is an admirably clear and consistent account of the nominalist doctrine, and presents the complete system of scholastic thought regarded from that point of view. The strong empirical individualism of the work, tending necessarily to limit the province of reason and extend that of faith, together with scattered utterances on special points, which gained for Biel the title of Papista Antipapista, had considerable influence in giving form to the new doctrines of Luther and Melanchthon. From its lucidity and relative completeness Biel’s work is the best specimen of the final aspect of scholasticism. His other works have also been frequently reprinted. With regard to. the title Ultimus Scholasticorum, often bestowed on Biel, it has been pointed out by all the best authorities that such a designation is quite inappropriate; scholasticism did not cease even in Germany with Biel,, and it continued to flourish long after his time in the universities of Spain.
