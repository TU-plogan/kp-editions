BÂNSWÂRÂ (literally, the forest country), a Râjput feudatory state under the Mewâr agency in Râjputânâ, extends from 23° 10' to 23° 48' N. lat., and from 74° 2' to 74° 41' E. long. It borders on Gujarât, and is bounded on the N. by the native states of Dungarpur and Udaipur or Mewâr; on the N.E. and E. by Pratâbgarh; on the S. by the dominions of Holkâr and the state of Jabuâ; and on the W. by the state of Riwâkânta. Bânswârâ State is about 45 miles in length from N. to S., and 33 miles in breadth from E. to W., and has an area of 1440 square miles, with an estimated population of 144,000 souls. The Mahi is the only river in the state, and great scarcity of water occurs in the dry season. The Mahârâwal, as the chief is called, has, however, undertaken the digging of wells, tanks, Ac., to meet this want. The Bânswârâ chief belongs to the family of Udaipur. During the vigour of the Dehli empire Bânswârâ, formed one of its dependencies; on its decline the state passed under the Marhattâs. Wearied out by their oppressions, its chief in 1812 petitioned for English protection, on the condition of his state becoming tributary on the expulsion of the Marhattâs. The treaty of 1818 gave effect to this arrangement; England guaranteeing the prince against external enemies and refractory chiefs; he, on his part, pledging himself to be guided by her representative in the administration of his state. There are 33 tributary chiefs or Thakurs of this state, and the whole strength of force kept up in 1870-71 was G17 men. Indian corn, wheat, pulses, rice, and other kinds of millet form the chief products of Bânswârâ. The revenue of the state amounted to £17,595 in 1870-71, exclusive of £3301 set apart for the personal expenditure of the chief and his family. The total expenditure in the same year amounted to £16,745. An annual tribute of £3997, or 50,000 Salimshâhi rupees, is paid by the chief to the British Government. The custom of sati, or widow-burning, has long been abolished in the state, but the people retain all their superstitions regarding witches and sorcery; and as late as 1870, a Bhil woman, about 80 years old, was swung to death at Kusalgarh in Bânswârâ, on an accusation of witchcraft. The perpetrators of the crime were sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment, but they had the sympathy of the people on their side. The chief town is Bânswârâ, lat. 23° 30' and long. 74° 24', situated about 8 miles W. of the Mahi river, surrounded by an old disused rampart, and adorned by various Hindu temples, with the battlements of the chief’s palace overlooking it.
