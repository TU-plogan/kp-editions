BISKARA, or Biskra, a town of Algeria, in the province of Constantine, and the most important military post of the Sahara. It lies on the south side of the Aures Mountains, in a fertile district, watered by the Wadi Biskra. The streets of the town are broad, and its houses are for the most part built of brick, one story high, and with terraced roofs. Among the principal buildings are the fort of St Germain, the caravanserai, the hospital, and the barracks. A large caravan trade between the Sahara and the Tell passes through the town; iron, limestone, and saltpetre are obtained in the neighbourhood, and the surrounding country yields abundance of valuable a dates. The chief articles of manufacture are burnous and carpets. An acclimatization garden has been established at Beni-Morra by the French, who first made themselves masters of Biskara in 1844. Population in 1872, 7367.
