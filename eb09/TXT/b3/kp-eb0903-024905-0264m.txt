BAKHCHISARAI (Turkish, the Garden Palace), a town of Russia in the government of Taurus, situated in a narrow gorge on the banks of a small stream called the Chiryuk-Su, about 10 miles S.S.W. of Simpheropol. Of unknown origin, it became towards the close of the 15th century the residence of the Tatar khans; and its chief objects of interest are the remains of its splendour under the Tatar dynasty. The principal building, the palace, or Khan-Serai, was originally erected in 1519 by Abdul-Sahal-Gerai, and was restored at Potemkin’s command by the architect Elson for the reception of Catherine. Not far off is a cemetery, which contains the tombs of many of the khans. There are, besides three or four churches and a synagogue, no fewer than thirty-five mosques, of which the most important was founded in the early part of the 18th century. The population still consists for the most part of Tatars, Catherine II. in 1783 having granted them the exclusive right of habitation in the city. The remainder consists of Russians, Greeks, Armenians, and Jews. Bakhchisarai is a place of considerable industry, manufacturing red and yellow morocco, sheepskin cloaks, agricultural implements, sabres, and other cutlery, and forming an important depot for the corn, flax, fruits, tobacco, and other produce of the whole surrounding district. In the neighbourhood is Chufut-Kali (or Jews’ city), the chief seat of the Karaitic Jews of the Crimea, situated on lofty and, except on one side, inaccessible cliffs. Population, 10,528.
