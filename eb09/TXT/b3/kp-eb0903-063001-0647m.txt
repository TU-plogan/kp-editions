BHÂWALPUR, a feudatory state in North-Western India, under the political jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Panjâb, lying between 27° 41' and 30° 25' N. lat., and 69° 30' and 73° 58' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Sind and Panjâb, on the E. and S.E. by the British district of Hissar and the Râjput states of Bikânir and Jasalmir, and on the S.W. by Sind. The state contains an estimated area of about 22,000 square miles; greatest length from N.E. to S.W., 310 miles; greatest breadth, 110 miles. Only a sixth part of the total area is capable of cultivation.

Thornton thus describes the general aspect of the state :—“Bhawalpur is a remarkably level country, there being no considerable eminence within its limits, as the occasional sand-hills, seldom exceeding 50 or 60 feet in height, cannot be considered exceptions. The cultivable part extends along the river line for a distance of about 10 miles in breadth from the left or eastern bank. In the sandy part of the desert beyond this strip of fertility both men and beasts, leaving the beaten path, sink as if in loose snow. Here, too, the sand is raised into ever-changing hills by the force of the wind sweeping over it In those parts of the desert which have a hard level soil of clay, a few stunted mimosas, acacias, and other shrubs are produced, together with rue, various bitter and aromatic plants, and occasionally tufts of grass. Much of the soil of the desert appears to be alluvial; there are numerous traces of streams having formerly passed over it, and still, where irrigation is at all practicable, fertility in the clayey tract follows; but the rains arc scanty, the wells few and generally 100 feet deep or more.”

The Ghara, a great stream formed by the united waters of the Bias and Satlej, the Indus, and the Panjnad, are the principal rivers .of the state, affording a continuous river-line of 300 or 350 miles in length. In 1872 the population was estimated at 472,791, the majority of whom are Mahometans, consisting of Jâts of Hindu descent, Beluchιs, and Afghans. The principal products are woollen and cotton cloths, silk goods, indigo, cereals, alum, saltpetre, &c. These form the principal exports; the imports are inconsiderable. Value of external trade in 1872, £358,000; internal trade, £444,700 Principal trade routes:—(1), From Bikânir to Central Asia via Bhawalpur; (2), from Jasalmir to Afghanistan; (3), from Bhâwalpur to Sind. In 1872 the gross revenue of the state was returned as £197,344; estimated military force, 2679 Principal towns-Bhawalpur, the capital, situated on a branch of the River Ghara; Ahmadpur, Uch, Khânpur, and Michinâbâd.

The state was a dependency of the Durâni kingdom till its dismemberment, when Bhâwalpur became independent. On the rise of Ranjit Singh, the khân of Bhawalpur tendered his allegiance to the British Government, and received a L·fe-pension of £10,000 per annum for his services in the Silch war. The present ruler is a minor (1875), and the state is now under British management, under which it has greatly prospered. The Panjâb Administration ReDort for 1871-72 states that on the death of the late chief, when Bhâwalpur came under British management, “the treasury was empty, the Government in debt, the army disorganized, the canals, on which cultivation mainly depends, neglected, while a general sense of insecurity prevailed; but now (1871-72) there is a cash balance of £80,000 in hand, the state debts have been paid off, the revenue has reached £200,000 a year (or double what it was three years ago), while the ordinary expenditure is about £160,000, the canals have been greatly increased in number and efficiency, waste lands have been brought under cultivation, population has increased, and the aπny has been reorganized.”
