BAXAR, or Buxar, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Behar, district of ShàhàbAd, on the south bank of the Ganges, in 25° 32' N.lat., 84° 3' E. long. The fort, though of small size, was important from its commanding the Ganges, but iβ now dismantled. The place is distinguished by a celebrated victory gained on the 23d October 1764 by the British forces under Major (afterwards Sir Hector) Munro, over the united armies of Sujà-ud-Daulah and Kasim Ali KhAn. The action raged from 9 o’clock till noon, when the enemy gave way. Pursuit was, however, frustrated by Sujâ-ud-Daulah sacrificing a part of his army to the safety of the remainder. A bridge of boats had been constructed over a stream about 2 miles distant from the field of battle, and this the enemy destroyed before their rear had passed over. Through this act 2000 troops were drowned, or otherwise lost; but destructive as was this proceeding, it was, says Major Munro, “the best piece of generalship Suja-ud-Daulah showed that day, because if I had crossed the rivulet with the army, I should either have taken or drowned his whole army in the Karamnàsà, and come up with his treasure and jewels, and Kasim Ali Khân’s jewels, which I was informed amounted to between two and three millions.” Population in 1872, 13,446.
