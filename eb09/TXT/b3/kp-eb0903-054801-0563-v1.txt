BELLINI, Lorenzo, physician and anatomist, was born at Florence in 1643. After completing his studies in general literature he went to Pisa, where, assisted by the generosity of the grand duke Ferdinand IL, he studied under two of the most learned men of that age, Oliva and Borelli, the former of whom instructed him in natural philosophy and the latter in mechanics. He likewise studied medicine under Redi, and mathematics under Marchetti. At the early age of twenty he was chosen professor of philosophy at Pisa, but did not long continue in this office; for he had acquired such a reputation for skill in anatomy, that the grand duke procured him a professorship in that science, and was himself a frequent auditor at his lectures. After a long residence in Pisa, he was invited to Florence and appointed physician to the grand duke Cosmo. He was also made senior consulting physician to Pope Clement XI. Bellini died in 1703, in the sixtieth year of his age. His works were published in a collected form in 1708 (2 vols. 4to), and reprinted in 1732.
