BARD, from the Welsh bardd, is the name applied to the ancient Celtic poets, though the word is sometimes loosely used as synonymous with poet in general. So far as can be ascertained, the title bards, and some of the privileges peculiar to that class of poets, are to be found only among Celtic peoples. The name itself is not used by Caesar in his account of the manners and customs of Gaul and Britain, but he appears to ascribe the functions of the bards to a section of the Druids, with which class they seem to have been closely connected. Later Latin authors, such as Lucan {Phar., p. 447), Festus (De Verb. Sign. s. v.), and Ammianus Marcellinus (bk. xv.), used the term Bardi as the recognized title of the national poets oι singers among the peoples of Gaul and Britain. In Gaul, however, the institution soon disappeared; the purely Celtic peoples were swept back by the waves of Latin and Teutonic conquest, and finally settled in Wales, Ireland. Brittany, and the north of Scotland. There is cleaι evidence of the existence of bards in all these places, though the known relics belong almost entirely to Wales and Ireland, where the institution was more distinctively national. In Wales they formed an organized society, with hereditary rights and privileges. They were treated with the utmost respect, and were exempt from taxes O) military service. Their special duties were to celebrate the victories of their people, and to sing hymns of praise tc God. They thus gave poetic expression to the religious and national sentiments of the people, and therefore ex ercised a very powerful influence. The whole society oi bards was regulated by laws, said to have been first dis tinctly formulated by Hywell Dha, and to have been after wards revised by Gruffydd ap Conan. At stated intervals great festivals were held, at which the most famous bards from the various districts met and contended in song, the umpires being generally the princes and nobles. Ever after the conquest of Wales, these festivals, or Eisisddfodau as they were called, continued to be summoned by the English sovereigns, but from the reign of Elizabeth the custom has been allowed to fall into abeyance. They have not since been summoned by royal authority, but have beer revived, and are held regularly at the present time. Ir Ireland also the bards were a distinct class with peculiaι and hereditary privileges. They appear to have beer divided into three great sections: the first celebrated victories and sang hymns of praise; the second chantec the laws of the nation; the third gave poetic genealogies and family histories. The Irish bards were held in higl repute, and frequently were brought over to Wales to give instruction to the singers of that country.
