BHIL, a tribe and a British political agency in Central India. The political agency comprises the following native states :—(1.) Dhâr, revenue in 1871-72, £60,000, expenditure £55,000; (2.) Bakhtnagar, revenue £5933, expenditure £4495; (3.) Jabuâ, revenue £11,000, expenditure the same; (4.) Alïrâjpur, revenue £12,095, expenditure £10,783; (5.) Matwash, revenue £620, expenditure £334; (6.) Jobat, revenue £1500, expenditure £1200; (7.) Kati-wârâ; (8.) Ratanmall; (9.) Amjherâ, Dektân, Sâgar, Bâng, Bankânir, and Manâwan, belonging to Sindhiâ; and (10.) Pitlâwad and Chikâldâ, belonging to Holkâr. The Bhil agency comprises an area of 8160 square miles, with a population of 240,000 souls, and consists of—(1) Mânpur Parganâ (British); (2.) Barwâni state (underBritish management in 1871-72); (3.) Jamniâ, Râjgash, Garhi, and other Bhurniâ chiefdoms; (4.) Holkâr’s districts south of the Vindhyan range; and (5.) Dewas or Bâgod Parganâ. The Bhil agency was formed in 1825, when the Bhil corps was organized, with a view to utilizing the warlike instincts of the Bhil tribes. This brave body of men have done good service, and gradually put down the predatory habits of their countrymen. The Bhil tribes chiefly inhabit the rocky ranges of the Vindhya and Sâtpurâ mountains, and the banks of the Narbadâ and the Taptf. In common with other hill tribes, the Bhils are supposed to have been aborigines of India, and to have been driven to their present fastnesses at the time of the Hindu invasion. They are of dark complexion and diminutive stature, but active, and capable of enduring great fatigue. Various efforts have been made by the British Government to reclaim this people from their predatory habits, and in 1869-70 the official report stated that “the Bhils of Mânpur are becoming reconciled to the life of cultivators, though not yet willing to take out leases.”
