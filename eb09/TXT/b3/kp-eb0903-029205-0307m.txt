BALMORAL CASTLE, a residence of Her Majesty Queen Victoria, on the right bank of the River Dee, about 9 miles above Ballater and 50 miles from Aberdeen. The property, which now consists of upwards of 10,000 acres, besides a large tract of hill ground, belonged in its original extent to the Farquharsons of Inverey, by whom it was sold to the Earl of Fife. In 1848 it was leased by the late Prince Consort, and in 1852 was finally purchased for a sum of £32,000. The castle, which was erected at Prince Albert’s private expense, is of the Scotch baronial style of architecture.
