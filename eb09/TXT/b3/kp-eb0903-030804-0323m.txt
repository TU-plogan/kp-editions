BANCROFT, Richard, Archbishop of Canterbury in the reign of James I., distinguished as an inflexible opponent of Puritanism, was born at Farnworth in Lancashire in 1544. He was educated at Cambridge University, studying first at Christ’s College, and afterwards at Jesus College. He took his degree of B.A. in 1567, and that of M.A. in 1570. Ordained about that time, he was named chaplain to Dr Cox, then bishop of Ely, and in 1575 was presented to the rectory of Teversham in Cambridgeshire. The next year he was one of the preachers to the university, and in 1584 was presented to the rectory of St Andrew’s, Holborn. His unquestionable abilities, and his zeal as a champion of the church in those unsettled times, secured him rapid promotion, and at length the highest ecclesiastical position in the land. He graduated B.D. in 1580, and D.D. five years later. In 1585 he was appointed treasurer of St Paul’s Cathedral, London. On February 9, 1589, he preached at Paul’s Cross a sermon on 1 John iv. 1, the substance of which was a passionate attack on the Puritans. He described their speeches and proceedings, caricatured their motives, denounced the exercise of the right of private judgment, and set forth the divine right of bishops in such strong language that one of the queen’s councillors held it to amount to a threat against the supremacy of the Crown. Sixteen days after the publication of this ecclesiastical manifesto, Bancroft was made a prebendary of St Paul’s. Within a few years he was advanced to the same dignity in the collegiate church of Westminster, and in the cathedral church of Canterbury. He was chaplain successively to Lord Chancellor Hatton and Archbishop Whitgift. In May 1597 he was consecrated bishop of London; and from this time, in consequence of the age and incapacity for business of Archbishop Whitgift, he was virtually invested with the power of primate, and had the sole management of [9:3:309] ecclesiastical affairs. Among the more noteworthy cases which fell under his direction were the proceedings against Martin Mar-Prelate, Cartwright and his friends, and the pious Penry, whose “seditious writings” he caused to be intercepted and given upto the Lord Keeper. In 1600 he was sent on an embassy, with others, to Embden, for the purpose of settling certain matters in dispute between the English and the Danes. This mission, however, failed. Bishop Bancroft was present· at the death of Queen Elizabeth. He took a prominent part in the famous conference of the prelates and the Presbyterian divines held at Hampton Court in 1604. By the king’s desire he undertook the vindication of the practices of confirmation, absolution, private baptism, and lay excommunication; he urged, but in vain, the re-inforcement of an ancient canon, “that schismatics are not to be heard against bishops;” and in opposition to the Puritans’ demand of certain alterations in doctrine and discipline, he besought the king that care might be taken for a praying clergy; and that, till men of learning and sufficiency could be found, godly homilies might be read and their number increased. In the capacity of a commissioner for ecclesiastical causes (1603), he advocated severe measures for the suppression of “heresy and schism,” treating books against Episcopacy as acts of sedition, and persecuting their authors as enemies of the state. In March 1604, Bancroft, in consequence of the death of the primate, was appointed by royal writ president of Convocation then assembled; and he there presented for adoption a book of canons collected by himself. In the following November he was elected successor to Whit gift in the see of Canterbury. He had now but six years of life before him. He continued to show the same zeal and βeverity as before, and with so much success that Lord Clarendon, writing in his praise, expressed the opinion that “if Bancroft had lived, he would quickly have extinguished all that fire in England which had been kindled at Geneva.” In 1605 he was sworn a member of the Privy Council. The same year he engaged in a contest with the judges, and exhibited articles of complaint against them before the lords of the council; but these complaints were overruled. He enforced discipline and exact conformity within the church with an iron hand; and forty-nine ministers of the church were deprived of their livings for disobedience to hi3 injunctions. In 1608 he was chosen chancellor of the University of Oxford. One of his latest public acts was a proposal laid before the parliament for improving the revenues of the church. In the last few months of his life he took part in the discussion about the consecration of certain Scottish bishops, and it was in pursuance of his advice that they were consecrated by several bishops of the English Church. By this act were laid the foundations of the Scottish Episcopal Church. Archbishop Bancroft was “the chief overseer” of the authorised version of the Bible, published within a year of his death. He died at Lambeth Palace, November 2,1610. His literary remains are very few and unimportant.
