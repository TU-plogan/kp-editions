BLAIR, or Port-Blair, the chief place in the convict settlement of the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean, is situated on the south-east shore of the South Andaman Island, in 11° 42'N. lat. and 93° E. long. In 1789 it was selected as a convict settlement, under orders of the Indian Government, by Lieutenant Blair, R.N., whose name the port bears. It possesses one of the best harbours in Asia, while its central position in the Bay of Bengal gives it immense advantage as a place of naval rendezvous for military operations in this part of the world. For further particulars see Andaman Islands.
