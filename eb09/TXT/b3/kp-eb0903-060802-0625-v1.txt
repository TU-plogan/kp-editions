+=====================================================================+


BERRYER, Pierre Antoine, a French advocate and parliamentary orator, was born at Paris, January 4, 1790, in the midst of the agitating events of the first year of the great Revolution. Berryer’s father was an eminent advocate and parliamentary counsellor. The son was educated at the Collège de Juilly, on leaving which he adopted, in deference to his father’s wishes, the profession of the law; but his own leaning at that time was to the church. After completing the usual course of professional studies, he was admitted advocate in 1811, and in the same year he married. In the great conflict of the period between Napoleon I. and the Bourbons, Berryer, like his father, was an ardent Legitimist; and in the spring of 1815, at the opening of the campaign of the Hundred Days, he followed Louis XVIII. to Ghent as a volunteer. After the second Restoration he distinguished himself as a courageous advocate of moderation in the treatment of the military adherents of the emperor. He was engaged, in conjunction with his father and Dupin, in the unsuccessful defence of Marshal Ney before the Chamber of Peers; and he undertook alone the defence of General Cambronne and General Debelle, procuring the acquittal of the former and the pardon of the latter. Proceedings were soon after commenced[9:3:609] against him for some assertions in one of his speeches, but he escaped with nothing more severe than a censure by the Council of Advocates. By this time he had a very large business as advocate, and was engaged on behalf of journalists in many press prosecutions. He stood forward with a noble resolution to maintain the freedom of the press, and severely censured the rigorous measures of the police department. In 1830, not long before the fall of Charles X., Berryer was elected a member of the Chamber of Deputies. He appeared there as the champion of the king, and encouraged him in his tyrannical course. After the Revolution of J uly, when the Legitimists withdrew in a body, Berryer alone retained his seat as deputy; and though avowedly the friend of the deposed king, he took an independent course, not making himself an unscrupulous partizan, but guided in his advocacy or his opposition by reason and prudence. He was one of the influential men who resisted, but unsuccessfully, the abolition of the hereditary peerage. He advocated trial by jury in press prosecutions, the extension of municipal franchises, and other liberal measures. In May 1832 he hastened from Paris to see the duchess of Berri on her landing in the south of France for the purpose of organizing an insurrection in favour of her son, the duke of Bordeaux, since known as the count of Chambord. Berryer attempted to turn her from her purpose; and failing in this he set out for Switzerland. He was, however, arrested, imprisoned, and brought to trial as one of the insurgents. He was immediately acquitted. In the following year he pleaded for the liberation of the countess; made a memorable speech in defence of Chateaubriand, who was prosecuted for his violent attacks on the Government of Louis Philippe; and undertook the defence of several Legitimist journalists. In 1834 he defended two deputies in a Government prosecution for libel, and the same year opposed the passing of a new rigorous law against political and other associations. Among the more noteworthy events of his subsequent career were his defence of Louis Napoleon after the ridiculous affair of Boulogne, in 1840, and a visit to England in December 1843, for the purpose of formally acknowledging the pretender, the duke of Bordeaux, then living in London, as Henry V., and lawful king of France. This proceeding brought on him the censure of Μ. Guizot, then first minister of Louis Philippe. Berryer was an active member of the National Assembly convoked after the Revolution of February 1848, again visited the pretender, then at Wiesbaden, and still fought in the old cause. This long parliamentary career was closed by a courageous protest against the coup d'état of December 2,1851. After a lapse of twelve years, however, he appeared once more in his forsaken field as a deputy to the Corps Législatif. Meanwhile he had been a diligent promoter of the much talked of fusion of the two branches of the Bourbon family, and had distinguished himself at the bar by great speeches on the trial of Montalembert in 1858, and in the civil proceedings set on foot by Μ. Patterson against Jerome Bonaparte in 1860. Berryer was elected member of the French Academy in 1854. A visit paid by this famous orator to Lord Brougham in 1865 was made the occasion of a banquet given in his honour by the benchers of the Temple and of Lincoln’s Inn. In November 1868 he was removed by his own desire from Paris to his country seat at Augervιlle, and there he died on the 29th of the same month.
