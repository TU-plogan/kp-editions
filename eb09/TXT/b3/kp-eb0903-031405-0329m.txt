BANIM, Joπn, an Irish novelist of great power and ability, was born at Kilkenny in 1798. He received a good education, and at a very early age gave evidence of remarkable genius. In his thirteenth year he entered Kilkenny College, where many other eminent Irishmen have received their training, and devoted himself specially to drawing and painting, in which he became so proficient that he resolved to adopt the profession of an artist. He accordingly proceeded to Dublin and studied for two years in the schools connected with the Royal Society, where he obtained high prizes. For some time afterwards he taught drawing in his native town, and while doing so had the misfortune to fall violently in love with one of his pupils. His affections were returned, but the parents of the young lady interfered and removed her from Kilkenny. She pined away and died in two months. The occurrence made a deep impression on Banim’s mind, and this, together with his exposure to the weather on the night of her funeral, caused a severe illness which completely shattered his health. After a partial recovery he set out for Dublin and settled finally to the work of literature. He published a poem, The. Celts' Paradise, and had some success as a writer for the stage. During a short visit to Kilkenny he married, and at the same time planned, in conjunction with his brother Michael (born 1796), a series of tales illustrative of Irish life. He then set out for London, the great centre of literary activity, and supported himself by writing for magazines and for the stage. A volume of miscellaneous essays was published anonymously in 1824, called Revelations of the Dead Alive. In April 1825 appeared the first series of Tales of the O’Hara Family, which achieved immediate and decided success. One of the most powerful of them, Crohoore of the Bill Hook, was by Michael Banim. In 1826 a second series was published, containing what is decidedly one of the best Irish novels in our literature, The Nowlans. John’s health had almost entirely given way,and the next effort of the “O’Hara family” was almost entirely the production of his brother Michael. The Croppy, a Tale of 1798, is hardly equal to the earlier tales, though it contains some wonderfully vigorous passages. The Denounced, The Mayor of Windgap, The Ghost Hunter (by Michael Banim), and The Smuggler, followed in quick succession, and were received with considerable favour. Banim, meanwhile, had completely broken down in health, and had become much straitened in circumstances. During his absence in France a movement to relieve his wants was set on foot by the English press, headed by Sterling in the Times. A sufficient sum was obtained to remove him from any danger of actual want, and to this Government afterwards added a pension [9:3:315] of £150. He settled in Windgap Cottage, a short distance from Kilkenny; and there, a complete invalid, he passed the remainder of his life. His last piece of literary work was the novel, entitled Father Connell. He died in July 1842, aged 44. Banim’s true place in literature is to be estimated from the merits of the O'Hara Tales; his later works, though of considerable ability, are not unfrequently prolix, and are marked by too evident an imitation of the Waυerley Novels. The Tales, however, show him at his best; they are masterpieces of faithful delineation. The strong passions, the lights and shadows of Irish peasant character, have rarely been so ably and truly depicted. The prevailing quality is a wonderful vehemence, combined with a gloominess extending at times to natural phenomena as well as to the characters of the tale; the incidents are striking, sometimes even horrible, and it is not without some justice that the authors have been accused of sensationalism, of straining after melodramatic effect. The lighter, more joyous side of Irish character, which appears so strongly in Lover, does not receive due prominence from the Banims. (See P. J. Murrav, Life of John Banim, 1857.)
