BATONI, Pompeo Girolamo, a native of Lucca, who was regarded in Italy as a great painter in the 18th century, and who unquestionably did much to rescue the art from the intense mannerism into which it had fallen during the century preceding. His paintings, however, are not of the highest order of merit, though they are generally graceful, well designed, and harmoniously coloured. His best production is thought to be his group of Peace and War. Batoni painted an unusual number of pictures, and was also celebrated for his portraits. He w as born in 1708, and died at Rome in 1787.
