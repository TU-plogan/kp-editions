BARCA, a maritime district of Northern Africa, which formerly belonged to Tripoli, but was raised in 1869 to be a separate province immediately dependent on Constantinople. It extends from the Gulf of Sert (the ancient Syrtes) to the Egyptian frontier, between lat. 30째 and 33째 N. and between long. 20째 and 25째 E., and has an area of about 60,700 square miles. This territory is traversed from east to west by a mountain chain varying in height from 400 or 500 to upwards of 1800 feet. A great part of Barca, particularly towards the coast, is very fertile, abounding with excellent pasturage, and producing large supplies of corn. The chief town is Bengazi.
