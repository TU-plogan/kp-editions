BEZA., Theodobe, or more correctly De Bèze, was born at Vezelai in Burgundy on the 24th July 1519. His family was of good descent, and his parents were noted for their piety and generosity. While an infant he was adopted by his uncle, Nicholas de Beza, a counsellor of the parliament of Paris, who took his nephew to live with him, and superintended his education with the greatest care. At the age of ten he was put under the tuition of Melchior Wolmar, a German, who resided at Orleans. Beza studied under him for seven years at Orleans and at Bourges, and from him received the impulse which guided his after life. Wolmar, who was an excellent scholar, belonged to the Reformed Church, and his pupil not only learned from him the principles of the Reformed faith, but acquired the habit of diligent and critical study of Scripture. After the return of Wolmar to Germany in 1535, Beza with great reluctance departed for Orleans in order to begin the study of law. His tasks lay altogether in the direction of classics and poetry, and to this period of his life must be referred the composition of many of the licentious poems, the publication of which cost him so much regret, and has brought upon him such calumny. After four years he obtained the degree of licentiate in law, and leaving Orleans, took up his abode in Paris. He was young, ardent, and poetical, of high rank, surrounded with friends, and amply supplied with funds,—for, though he was not in orders, he enjoyed the proceeds of two benefices. It was small wonder that under these circumstances he should have yielded to the temptations of Paris, and have eagerly seized the pleasures that presented themselves. But the extent of his dissipation has been enormously exaggerated; more particularly has his connection with the woman whom he afterwards married been the occasion of calumny and misrepresentation. A severe illness at last recalled to his mind the teachings of his old master Wolmar, and brought clearly before him the contrast his conduct presented to them. Immediately on his recovery, in October 1548, he retired to Geneva, publicly fulfilled his promise to marry the woman with whom he had formerly lived, and joined the Reformed Church. In the following year he was made professor of Greek at the academy of Lausanne, where he remained for ten years, communicating frequently with Calvin at Geneva. During this time he completed Clement Marot’s French translation of the Psalms, and began the extended labours on the New Testament, which resulted in his famous translation and commentary. His veneration for Calvin, already great, was strengthened by closer intercourse; he vigorously defended the execution of Servetus; and in 1558 he gladly removed to Geneva. He was appointed professor of Greek in the academy, and assisted Calvin in his theological lectures. Soon by his vigorous teaching, his numerous writings, and his success in foreign embassies, he came to be looked upon as the most prominent man in the church of Geneva next to Calvin; and after the death of the latter in 1564, he was nominated his successor as teacher of theology, and generally recognized as the leader of the Calvinist party. His enormous activity enabled him not only to manage the internal affairs of the church, and to carry on the important negotiations with France and other powers, but also to compose several theological works of considerable value. Old age did not rob him of his energy; for in 1597 he was able to give a satirical refutation of the story spread about by the Roman Catholics that he had apostatized on his death-bed. He resigned all his official functions in 1600, and died on the 13th October 1605, at the advanced age of 86.

Beza’s works were very numerous, and some of them, such as Histoire ecclésiastique des églises réformées du royaume de France, Confessio, Tractationes Theologicae, are still of value. His reputation, however, rested, and still perhaps rests, on his editione and translations of the New Testament, which did much for the cause of the Reformation. See Schlosser, Leben des Theodor Beza, etc., 1809; Baum, Theodor Beza, 2 vols., 1843-51 (incomplete). A biography of him was written by one of his favourite pupils, Antoine La Faye.
