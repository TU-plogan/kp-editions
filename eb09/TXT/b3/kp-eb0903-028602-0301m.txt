BALLÀRÏ [Bellary], a district in the Madras Presidency, lies between 13° 40' and 15° 58' N. lat., 75° 44' and 78° 19' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the Nizâm’s territory, from which it is separated by the Tungbhadrfi river; on the E. by the districts of Kadapa and Karnul; on the S. by the Mysore country; and on the W. by Mysore, and the Bombay district of Dharwar. Its extreme length from north to south is 170 miles, and its breadth from east to west about 120 miles. The area of the district, including 145 square miles of the Sandfir State, is estimated at about 11,496 square miles; according to other returns, the area is 10,857 square miles (excluding Sandfir), of which 1004 consists of barren soil, sites of villages, beds of water-courses, Ac., and 9852 of lands either actually cultivated or capable of cultivation. The census of 1871 returned the population at 1,652,044, of whom 94 per cent, were Hindus. It is estimated that 941,712, or 71 ’ 8 per cent, of the population, live by agriculture. The general aspect of the district is that of an extensive plateau between the Eastern and Western Ghfits, of an average height of from 800 to 1000 feet above sealevel. The most elevated tracts are on the W., where the surface rises towards the culminating range of hills, and on the S., where it rises to the elevated table-land of Mysore. Towards the centre the surface of the plain presents a monotonous aspect, being almost treeless, and unbroken [9:3:287] save by a few rocky elevations that stand forth abruptly from the sheet of black soil below. The hill ranges in Ballâri are those of Sandur and Kampli to the W., the Lankâ Malia to the E., and the Copper mountain to the S.W. The last has an elevation of 3148 feet. Th^e district is watered by five hill streams, viz., the Tungbhadrâ, formed by the junction of two small rivers, Tung and Bhadrâ, the Haggari, Hindri, Ponnâr, and Chitravati. The Ponnâr is considered a sacred river by the natives. None of the rivers are navigable, and all are fordable during the dry season.

The agricultural products of the district are cotton, indigo, wheat, rice, sugar-cane, flax, betel, plantain, turmeric, chillies, onions, hemp, coriander, tobacco, areca-nut, cocoa-nut, oil-seeds, &c. The following is a rough estimate of acreage under different crops :— Food grains, 2,687,000 acres; oil-seeds, 103,000 acres; green and garden crops, 36,000 acres; orchards, 18,000 acres; cotton, indigo, and sugar-cane, 37,000 acres; fallow, 541,000 acres; total, 3,922,000 acres. The manufactures of the district consist of cotton goods, tape, carpets, rope, blankets, felts, dyes, oil, sugar and molasses, paper, leather, glass bangles or bracelets, and iron and earthen pots. Cotton, blankets, raw hides, iron, &c., form the articles of export. The chief mineral products are iron, copper, lead, antimony, manganese, alum, and gun-flints. Among precious stones diamonds are found, the chief diamond mines being at Munimadagu and Wajrâ-kanir. The diamonds are collected in the sandstone breccia and conglomerate. The mines no longer yield sufficient profit to be regularly worked, though every now and then diamonds of small value are met with. The revenue of the Ballari district from all sources amounted in 1845 to £257,199; in 1855 to £248,284; and in 1868 to £322,548. The land tax forms the principal source of revenue. In 1868 it yielded £242,684. More than one-fourth of the lands are held as Indm, i.e., under grants formerly made for services or for religious purposes. These were very lightly taxed by the native Governments,but the present state of their assessment is not less than that of ordinary lands. The police force numbered 1122 in 1871, maintained at. a cost of £16,012. In 1870-71 the district contained 153 schools, attended by 4274 pupils. It has only seven towns with a population of more than 7000 souls—(1), Ballari, population, including troops in the cantonment, 51,145; (2), Hospetta, 9845; (3), Tadipatri, 8182; (4), IIarpanhalli, 7895; (5), Raidrug, 7734; (6), Emmiganur, 7326; and (7), Yadiki, 7202. Only four municipal towns exist in the district :—1. Ballari—population, 51,145; municipal income in 1871, £7651; expenditure, £7495; rate of taxation, 2s. 3¾d- per head. 2. Gutti—population, 6033; municipal income, £992; expenditure, £930; rate of taxation, 3s. 3}d. per head. 3. Anantpur—population, 4971; municipal income, £794; expenditure, £784; rate of taxation, 3s. 2∣d. per head. 4. Adoni—municipal income, £2147; expenditure, £1905. Fifty-nine roads, of a total length of 1465 miles, connect the different towns and villages in the Ballari district; and the Madras Railway, with a branch to Ballâri, passes through it. The climate of Ballari is characterised by extreme dryness, in consequence of the air passing over a great extent of heated plains, and it has a smaller rainfall than any other district in South India. The average daily range of the thermometer is from 67° to 83°; average rain-fall for the five years ending 1869, 17 inches. The prevailing diseases are cholera, fever, small-pox, ophthalmia, dysentery, and skin diseases among the lower classes. Ballari is subject to disastrous storms and hurricanes, and to famines arising from a series of bad seasons. The storms of 1804 and 1851, and the famines of 1751, 1792, 1793, 1803, 1833, 1854, and 1866 still live in the popular memory.

Little is known of the early history of the district. It appears to have been a portion of the ancient kingdom of Vijayanagaram, and on the overthrow of that state in 1564 A.D. by the Mahometans, the tract now forming the district of Ballâri λvas split up into a number of military holdings, held by chiefs called Poligârs. In 1635 the Carnatic was annexed to the Bijâpur dominions, from which again it was wrested in 1680 by Sivaji, the founder of the Marhattâ power. It was then »eluded in the dominions of Nizâm-ul-mulk, the nominal viceroy of the Great Mughul in the Dakhin, from whom again it was subsequently conquered by Haidar All of Mysor. At the close of the war with Tipù Sultân in 1792, the territories which now form the Ballari district fell to the share of the Nizam of Haidarâbâd, by whom it was ceded to the British in 1800, in return for a force of English troops to be stationed at his capital. In 1818 the district of Ballâri was constituted as it at present remains. Amidst all these political convulsions the little state of Sandιir, occupying a central position in the Ballâri district, and surrounded by a cordon of hills, preserved its integrity. Sandur can only be entered by one of three principal natural passes, viz., the Bhimagundi pass on the N.E., the Râmanagundi pass on the N., and the Oblagundi pass on the W. Its chief is the representative of one of the most ancient Marhattâ families, and derives a revenue of £4500 from his state. He now holds Sandιir as a Jâgir or a military tenure from our Government, but pays no tribute.

Ballârî, the principal town of the above district, is the chief seat of the judicial and revenue establishments, and the headquarters of the military force iu the ceded districts consisting of Ballâri and Kadapa. The fort rises from a huge mass of granitic rocks, which jut up abruptly to a height of 450 feet above the plain, with a circumference of nearly 2 miles. Its length from north-east to south-west is about 1150 feet. To the E. and S. of the Ballâri rock lies a heap of boulders irregularly piled one on the other, but to the W. is an unbroken surface of sheet-rock, while the N. is walled by bare rugged ridges. Ballâri rock is defended by two distinct lines of works, the upper and the lower fort. The upper fort is a quadrangular building on the summit of the rock, with only one way up to it, and deemed impregnable by the Mysore princes. But as it has no accommodation for a garrison, it is now unoccupied by our troops, with the exception of a small guard in charge of prisoners. The ex-Nawâb of Karnul was confined in it for forty years for the murder of his wife. It contains several tanks or cisterns excavated in the rock. Outside the turreted rampart are a ditch and covered way. The lower fort lies at the eastern base of the rock, and measures about half a mile in diameter. It contains the barracks for our troops, the arsenal and commissariat stores, the Protestant church, orphanage, Masonic lodge, post-office, and numerous private dwellings. The fort of Ballâri was originally built by one Timmapa, in the 16th century. It was first dependent on the kingdom of Vijayanagaram, afterwards on Bijâpur, and subsequently subject to the Nizâm and Haidar All The latter improved the fortifications with the assistance of French artisans, whom he afterwards hanged for not building the fort on a higher rock adjacent to it. The cantonment bâzâr of Ballâri enjoys the reputation of being the best military bâzâr in Southern India. To the W. of the rock are the regimental lines for two Native infantry regiments, one European regiment, and one regiment of cavalry. On the E. are the jail, the public courts, and the terminus of the branch line of the Madras Railway. Ballâri town, including the cantonment, contained in 1866 a population of 37,015 'souls, of which 13,341 were Hindus, 4178 Mahometans, and 1042 Christians. Population ascertained by the census of 1871, 51,145. Elevation above the sea, 1600 feet. Distance from Bombay, S.E., 380 miles; from Madras, N.W., 270 miles. Lat. 15° 18' N.; long. 76° 59' E.
