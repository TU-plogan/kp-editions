BALFROOSH, or Barfurush, a large commercial town of Persia, province of Mazanderan, on the River Bhawal, which is here crossed by a bridge of nine arches, about twelve miles distant from the southern shore of the Caspian Sea, where the small town of Meshed-i-Sir serves as a kind of port. Built in a low and swampy, though fertile country, and approached by deep and almost impassable roads, it would not seem at all favourably situated for the seat of an extensive inland trade. It is, however, peopled entirely by merchants, mechanics, and their dependants, and is wholly indebted for its present size and importance to its commercial prosperity. The principal articles of its trade are rice, silk, and cotton. The town is of a very peculiar structure and aspect. It is placed in the midst of a forest of tall trees, by which the buildings are so separated from one another, and so concealed, that, except in the bazaars, it has no appearance of a populous town. The streets aro broad and neat, though generally unpaved; and they are kept in good order. No ruins are to be seen, as in other Persian towns; the houses are comfortable, in good repair, roofed with tiles, and enclosed by substantial walls. There are no public buildings of any importance. The only places of interest are the bazaars, which extend fully a mile in length, and consist of substantially-built ranges of shops, covered with a roof of wood and tiles, and well stored with commodities. There are about ten principal caravansaries, and from twenty to thirty medresses or colleges, the place being as much celebrated for learning as for commerce. At the time of Fraser’s visit (1822) it was said to contain 200,000 inhabitants, but this was probably an exaggeration. Since that time its population has undergone various fluctuations, and is now estimated at 125,000. Long. 52° 42' E., lat. 36° 37' N.
