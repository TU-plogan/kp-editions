BAIRAM, a Turkish or Persian word meaning feast, is the name applied to the two great Mahometan festivals. The first of these, called generally, though, according to some authorities, incorrectly, the Greater Bairam, is the day following the Ramadan, or month of fasting. It lasts strictly for only one day, though the common people generally extend it to three, and is a period of great animation and enjoyment. What is called commonly the Lesser Bairam follows the first at an interval of sixty days. It is the feast of sacrifices, at which all Mahometans imitate the offerings of animals which are then being made at Mecca to commemorate Abraham’s offering of Isaac. ’ It lasts for four days, and is not of so sacred a character as the first Bairam.
