BARNEVELDT, Jan van Olden, Grand Pensionary of Holland, who played a great part and rendered the most signal services to his country in the long conflict with Philip II. of Spain, was born in 1547. He was a native of Amersfoort in the province of Utrecht, and could boast of a long line of noble ancestors. Endowed with superior abilities, he was educated for the profession of the law, and commenced practice as an advocate at the Hague in 1569. He sympathized deeply with his countrymen in their resolution to throw off the hated yoke of Spain, and served as a volunteer at the sieges of Haarlem and Leyden. In 1575 he married; and in the following year he was appointed to the honourable post of counsellor and chiefpensionary of Rotterdam. In 1585, when, in consequence of the assassination of the sagacious and resolute leader of the Dutch, and the general success of the Spaniards under the Prince of Parma, the cause of the patriots seemed almost hopeless, Barneveldt was chosen head of an embassy to Queen Elizabeth, to ask for her assistance and to offer her the sovereignty of the United Provinces. The queen agreed to give aid both in money and in men, but refused to accept the sovereignty. An expedition was sent under the command of Dudley, earl of Leicester, on whom the Dutch conferred supreme and absolute authority. Barneveldt was then raised to the high office of advocate-general of Holland and West Friesland. Dissatisfied and indignant at Leicester’s incompetence, arrogance, and mismanagement, he endeavoured to limit his powers. For this purpose he succeeded in persuading the States to appoint Maurice of Nassau, the young son of the late Prince of Orange, stadtholder and captain-general of Holland and Zealand, thus contributing to place in the highest position the man who was afterwards to become his great antagonist. Leicester was recalled at the close of 1586. In the course of a few years Barneveldt, by his prudence and energy in administration, succeeded in restoring order and materially improving the financial affairs of the States. He proposed to resign in 1592, but at the urgent entreaty of the States retained his post. In 1598 he was sent on an embassy to Henry IV. of France, the object of which was to strengthen and maintain the friendship of France and the United Provinces. In 1603, on the accession of James I. to the throne, Barneveldt was again sent to England as head of an embassy, and in conjunction with the French ambassador, Μ. de Rosny, afterwards duke of Sully, negotiated an arrangement for further assistance against the Spaniards. In 1607, having first insisted on and obtained a recognition of the independence of the Provinces, he began negotiations with Spain with a view to establish a truce. He had to contend against the opposition of the stadtholder and the army, and to suffer from unmerited popular suspicions of taking bribes from the Spanish court. But he triumphed over all difficulties, and on April 9, 1609, the famous twelve years’ truce was concluded. From this time Maurice was his sworn foe. The two men were leaders of two great political parties, and the struggle between them was embittered by the admixture of theological and ecclesiastical controversy. In the strife then going on between the Gomarites (the Calvinistic party) and the Arminians, Maurice sided with the former, while Barneveldt supported the latter. Maurice was aiming at the sovereign power; Barneveldt resolutely maintained the freedom of the republic. The clerical party, who looked up to Prince Maurice as their chief, were bent on getting the Calvinistic system established as the state religion, and on refusing to tolerate any other system; Barneveldt and the Arminians contended that each province should be free to adopt the form which it preferred. Barneveldt was the consistent champion of the supremacy of the civil authority, and “the prime minister of Protestantism” (Motley). The convocation of a National Synod was proposed by the party of the stadtholder and resisted by Barneveldt. When disturbances broke out against the Arminians, Maurice refused [9:3:380] to suppress them, and disarmed the militia organized for the purpose by Barneveldt. The former now assumed the chief power. An interview took place on August 17,1618, between the advocate and the stadtholder; each adhered resolutely to his own views, and the meeting remained fruitless. Barneveldt, -with his friends Grotius and Hoo-gerbeets, was arrested and imprisoned on the 29th. In November following, in pursuance of the command of Prince Maurice, the famous Synod of Dort assembled. A few days later the trial of the prisoners began before a special. commission. The proceedings were illegal; the accusations against Barneveldt were fully disproved, but he was unjustly found guilty and sentenced to death. This sentence was unscrupulously confirmed by the clerical synod. It was a foregone conclusion, and Barneveldt had seen clearly that there was no hope for him. On the 14th of May 1619, just five days after the closing of the synod, the venerable statesman and patriot, then in his seventy-first year, was beheaded at the Hague. He met his fate without a word of regret, without a sign of fear. His calm courage and his tenderness of heart are attested by a letter, still extant, written to his wife a few hours before his execution. Besides his wife, Maria van Utrecht, Barneveldt left two sons and two daughters. Four years after their, father’s death the sons took part in a plot against Prince Maurice; one of them made his escape and entered the service of Spain, the other was arrested and beheaded.

An elaborate history of The Life and Death of John of Barneveld, with a View of the Primary Causes and Movements of the Thirty Years' War, by J. L. Motley, author of the Bise of the Dutch Republic, appeared in 1874.
