BEATTIE, James, a Scottish poet and writer on philosophy, was born at Laurencekirk on the 25th October 1735. His father, a small farmer and shopkeeper, died when he was very young; but an elder brother took charge of the boy, and observing his aptitude for learning sent him to Marischal College, Aberdeen, where he gained a bursary. In 1753 he was appointed schoolmaster of Fordoun, at the foot of the Grampian hills, amongst splendid scenery, which impressed itself deeply on Beattie’s somewhat poetical mind. In 1758 he obtained a situation as undermaster in the grammar school, Aberdeen, and two years later he was made professor of moral philosophy at Marischal College. Here he became closely acquainted with Reid, Campbell, Gerard, and others, who formed a kind of literary or philosophical society, in which speculative questions, above all the views of Hume, were canvassed and criticized. In 1770 Beattie published his Essay on the Nature and Immutability of Truth, in which he attacked Helvetius and Hume, and advocated the doctrine afterwards familiarly known as that of Common Sense. The work had an astonishing success, and its author, when on a visit to London in 1773, was received with the greatest honour by the king himself. About the same time he received a pension of £200 a year. In 1773 and 1774 he published the first and second parts of The Minstrel, which were received with great favour, and gained for the author a fresh accession of popularity. His later writings are partly literary, such as the Essays, 1766; Dissertations, 1783, partly philosophical; Evidences of Christianity, 1781; Elements of Moral Science, 1790-93. Beattie was unfortunate in his domestic life. His wife, whom he married in 1767, was afflicted with insanity, a disease which she appears to have inherited from her mother. Two sons, all his family, died just as they were attaining manhood. The elder, James Hay Beattie, a young man of great promise, who at the age of nineteen had been associated with his father in the professorship, died in 1790. The younger brother died in 1796. Beattie never recovered his second blow. His mind was nearly overthrown by it; his spirit was completely broken, and although he still lectured, he neither wrote nor studied. In 1799 he was attacked with palsy, and continued to suffer from that disease for three years. He died on the 18th August 1803. Beattie’s fame rests now solely on his poems. The much celebrated Essay on Truth is a work of no philosophic ability, and is disfigured by the violent and intemperate language of the author. His other writings on philosophical subjects, such as the Elements of Moral Science, are excessively weak, and have fallen into well-deserved oblivion. The Minstrel, however, is a work which will always retain a considerable share of popular favour. The ground-plan is simple and well conceived,—to trace the development of poetic genius in a youth from his earliest years up to the time when he becomes able to take his place as a minstrel. There runs through the poem a fine vein of quiet reflection, interspersed with animated descriptions of natural scenery. The versification is smooth [9:3:467] and melodious. (See Life of Beattie, by his friend Sir W. .Forbes, 1806.)
