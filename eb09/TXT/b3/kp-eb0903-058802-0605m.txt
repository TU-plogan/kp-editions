BERGEN-OP-ZOOM, a town of Holland, in the province of North Brabant, situated on both sides of the River Zoom, near its confluence with the East Scheldt, in 51° 29' N. lat. and 4° 17' E. long. It is about 15 miles N. of Antwerp, and 22 W.S.W. of Breda. The houses are well built, the market-places and squares handsome and spacious. It possesses a port and an arsenal, and contains a townhouse, a Latin school, and an academy of design and architecture. The tower of the old castle is remarkable for an increase of its breadth from the bottom upwards, and for its liability to be rocked when struck by a strong wind. There are numerous tile-works and potteries of fine ware; and a considerable trade is carried on in anchovies caught in the Scheldt.

In the 13th century Bergen-op-Zoonι became the seat of Count Gerhard of Wesemael, who surrounded it with walls. In 1533 it was erected by Charles V. of Germany into a marquisate, which was successively held by the families of Berghes, Merode, Witthem, s’Heerenbergh, Hohenzollern, Tour d’Auvergne, and Sulzbach, and thus passed to the house of Bavaria, which, however, in 1801 abdicated itβ rights in favour of the Dutch republic. In 1576 the town joined the United Netherlands, and was shortly afterwards fortified, in 1588 it was unsuccessfully besieged by the duke of Parma (see Motley’s United Netherlands, chap, xx.), and in 1605 it was suddenly attacked by Du Terail (Ibid. chap, xliv.) In 1622 it defied the utmost attempts of Spinola, who was forced to abandon the enterprise after a siege of ten weeks and the loss of 1200 men. Its fortifications were greatly strengthened in 1688 by Cooehoorn, who, it was believed, had almost rendered it impregnable; and in 1725 they were further extended. In 1747, however, the town was taken by the French general Lowendal. Restored at the end of the war, it was again in 1795 taken by Pichegru. The English, under Sir Thomas Graham, afterwards Lord Lynedoch, in March 1814 made an attempt to take it by a coup de main, but were driven back with great loss by the French, who, however, surrendered the place by the treaty of peace in the following May.
