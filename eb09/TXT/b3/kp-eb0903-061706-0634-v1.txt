BETLIS, Bulk, or Bedlis, a town of Turkish Armenia, in the Sandjak of Mûsh, situated near the south-weet corner of Lake Van, in a highly cultivated valley, which is watered by the Bitlis-chai, a sub-tributary of the Tigris. Partly owing to the irregularity of the ground, the houses are scattered without much attention to order, and most of them are surrounded with gardens or orchards. The castle of the Bey, a straggling structure, is situated on the lava rock that bounds the valley; while in the centre of the town, on an eminence so steep that it is only accessible by a road winding round it, stand the ruins of an ancient fortress of great strength. Betlis is a great seat of the dancing dervishes, who have twelve convents in the place. The Armenians, who form about a fourth of the population, have four churches and as many monasteries, and the Mahometans possess numerous mosques and medresses. A considerable trade is carried on, as well as the manufacture of gold and silver wares, the weaving of cotton-cloth and carpets, and the preparation of tobacco. According to an Armenian tradition Betlis was founded by Alexander the Great. In 1514 it became a Turkish possession, and it has for about three centuries been held as a fief by a Kurdish family. The population is variously estimated at from 10,000 to 12,000.
