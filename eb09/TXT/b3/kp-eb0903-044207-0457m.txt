BATTALION is the tactical unit of infantry. It is the term applied to the most numerous body of dismounted men which one commanding officer can personally superintend. It consists of from four to ten companies, is always commanded by a field officer, and has a normal war strength of about 1000 men. Two or more battalions constitute a regiment; two or more regiments a brigade; two or more brigades a division; two or more divisions a corps d'armée; and two or more corps d'armée an army. In the British service, however, there are several regiments consisting of but one battalion. See Army.
