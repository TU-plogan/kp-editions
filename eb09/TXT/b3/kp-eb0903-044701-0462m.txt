BAUHIN, Jean, brother of the above, was born at Basel in 1541. He studied at Tübingen under the celebrated botanist Fuchs, and afterwards travelled with Conrad Gesner, and collected plants in the Alps, in France, and in Italy. He first practised medicine at Basel, where he was elected professor of rhetoric in 1566. He then resided for some time at Yverdun, and in 1570 was invited to be physician to the duke of Würtemberg at Montbéliard,—a situation in which he spent the remainder of his life. He devoted his time chiefly to botany, on which he bestowed great labour. He likewise prosecuted other branches of natural history, and published an account of Medicinal Waters throughout Europe. His great work on plants was not completed at his death, which happened in 1613. A society at Yverdun published in 1619 the “Prodromus;” but it was not till 1650 and 1651 that the work itself appeared, in three vols, folio, entitled Historia Plantarum nova et absolutissima, cum auctorum consensu et dissensu circa eas. It was long considered a standard work, and, with all its defects, it entitles its author to a high place among the founders of botanical science.
