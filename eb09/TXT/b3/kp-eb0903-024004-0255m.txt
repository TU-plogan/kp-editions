BAIBURT, a town of Asiatic Turkey, in the pashalic of Erzeroum, and 65 miles W.N.W. from that city. According to Neumann it was an Armenian fortress in the 1st century, and it is identified by Ritter with the Baiberdon fortified by Justinian. It was afterwards one of the strongholds of the Genoese, when prosecuting their trade with India. Remains of their fortifications still exist, but in a very dilapidated state, the Russians having blown up the defences in 1829. (See view in Yuleâ€™s Marco Polo, vol. i.) Population of town about 6000.
