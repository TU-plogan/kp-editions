BARTH, Heinrich, a distinguished African explorer, was born at Hamburg, February 16, 1821. At the age of eighteen he went to Berlin, and completed his education at the university of that city. After a year of study he set out to travel in Italy and Sicily, returning to Berlin in 1841, and continuing his studies for three years. He took his degree in 1844, and yielding to a desire, which had long possessed him, to explore the countries lying on the Mediterranean, he made his first visit to North Africa in 1845. Before setting out he had visited London and Paris, and made himself acquainted with the Arabic language. He reached Tunis, Tripolis, Benghasi, explored Cyrenaica, and travelled down the valley of the Nile. On his return journey he was attacked and wounded by robbers. In 1847 he travelled in Egypt and Palestine, and in Asia Minor and the islands off its coasts, and from Constantinople returned through Greece to Berlin. For a time he was engaged there as Privat-docent, and in preparing for publication the narrative of his Wanderungen durch die Küstenländer des Mittelmeeres, which appeared in 1849. At the suggestion of Bunsen and Ritter he entered with enthusiasm into the project of the English expedition for the exploration of Central Africa, and set out with Overweg in November 1849. Five years were devoted to their explorations, and Barth did not arrive in Europe till September 1855. His account, entitled Reise und Entdeckungen in Nord-und Centralafrika, appeared in 5 vols., between 1855 and 1858, and was followed by a collection of Central African vocabularies (1862-64). Dr Barth had not yet exhausted his energies as a traveller. In 1858 he undertook another journey in Asia Minor, and in 1862 visited Turkey in Europe. In the following year, having returned to Berlin, he was appointed professor of geography at the university, and president of the Geographical Society. He died at Berlin, November 25, 1865.
