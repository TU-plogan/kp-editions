BARRAS, Paul François Jean Nicolas, Comte de, a distinguished actor in the great French Revolution, was born in June 1755. He was a descendant of a noble family in Provence, and at an early age entered the army. He was twice in India with his regiment, but retired from the service after attaining the rank of captain. Like many others, he saw in the Revolution a good opportunity for retrieving his fortunes, which had been ruined by his extravagance and dissipation; and his penetration enabled him to foresee the certain fall of the royalist party. He threw in his lot with the revolutionists, and speedily distinguished himself by his vigour and hardihood. When elected a member of the National Convention, he gave an uncompromising vote for the king’s death; and at the siege of Toulon, where for the first time he met Napoleon, his energetic measures contributed much to the success of the French arms. Robespierre, who hated Barras for his dissolμte habits, and feared him for his boldness, endeavoured to have his name included in one of his prescription lists, but, on the 9th Thermidor 1794 Barras completely overthrew his power. His success from this period was secured; after the 13th Vindémiaire 1795, he was nominated general-in-chief; and after the affair of the 18th Fructidor 1797, in which Augereau played a prominent part, he was practically dictator. Bonaparte’s coup d’etat of the 18th Brumaire 1799 changed the whole aspect of affairs. Barras, seeing that resistance to his powerful protégé was useless, gave in his resignation, and retired to his country seat. His latter years were spent in various intrigues, in which he showed a strong leaning towards the royalist party. He died in 1829. The character of Barras has little in it that is worthy of admiration. He was dissolute in private life, and can scarcely be said to have had any definite public policy. At the same time he was courageous, prudent, and, on occasions, an able speaker.
