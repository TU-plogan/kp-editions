BARROW, Siu John, Bart., was born near Ulverston, in Lancashire, June 19, 1764. His early opportunities of instruction were limited; but by self-education he matured those powers which eventually were turned to so good an account. He displayed at an early age a decided inclination for mathematical pursuits. He passed some years of his youth as superintending clerk of an iron foundry at Liverpool, and he afterwards taught mathematics at an academy in Greenwich. While in the latter situation he was fortunate in obtaining, through the interest of Sir George Staunton, a place in the first British embassy to China. He was thus enabled to put his foot on the first step of the ladder of ambition; but each step in his subsequent career may be fairly said to have been achieved by himself. The account of the embassy published by Sir George Staunton records many of Barrow’s valuable contributions to literature and science connected with China. This work, together with his own subsequently published volume of [9:3:397] travels, is ample evidence how well his time had been employed. Few persons could, within the space of a few months, overcome all the practical difficulties of such a language as the Chinese; but Barrow soon began to converse in it. and acquired a complete knowledge of its theory. His papers on this subject in the Quarterly Review (to which periodical he was for many years a very frequent contributor) contain a very admirable account of that singular language.

Although Barrow ceased to be personally connected with Chinese affairs after the return of the embassy in 1794, he always continued to take a lively interest in them, and on critical occasions was frequently consulted by the British Government. His services were secured by Lord Macartney in his important and delicate mission to settle the government of the newly-acquired colony of the Cape of Good Hope. Barrow was entrusted with opening communications with the Kaffres, in which he displayed a spirit, judgment, and humanity, which unfortunately were less conspicuous in subsequent transactions with those tribes. The two volumes of his history of the colony made the public fully acquainted with the extent, capacities, and resources of that important, but till then little understood, acquisition of the British Crown. There is little doubt that it was the perusal of this valuable work which mainly decided Lord Melville to appoint Barrow, though then a perfect stranger to him, as his second secretary of the Admiralty. Barrow’s subsequent career for forty years at the Admiralty (embracing the whole period of the war with France), will be for ever historically associated with the civil administration of the British navy for the same period. He enjoyed the esteem and confidence of all the eleven chief lords who successively presided at the Admiralty Board during that period, and more especially of King William IV., while lord high admiral, who honoured him with tokens of his personal regard. Barrow was a fellow of the Royal Society, and had the degree of LL.D. The honour of a baronetcy was conferred on him by Sir Robert Peel in 1835; the letter in which the honour was announced acknowledged, in highly gratifying terms, his literary and scientific eminence, and his “Jong, most able, and most faithful public service.”

Besides the works already mentioned, Barrow published the lives of Lord Macartney, Lord Anson, Lord Howe, and Peter the Great; and he was also the author of several valuable contributions to the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.

He retired from public life in 1845, in consideration of his advanced years, although still in vigorous possession of all the mental and bodily powers required for the due discharge of the functions of his office. In the course of the three following years his vital energies gradually declined, but he nevertheless continued so fully in the enjoyment of his faculties, writing a history of the modern Arctic voyages of discovery, of which he was a great promoter, as well as his autobiography, published in 1847, that his friends and relatives entertained no apprehension that his end was so near. He expired suddenly on the 23d November 1848, in the 85th year of his age, much honoured and respected by his friends and the public at large.
