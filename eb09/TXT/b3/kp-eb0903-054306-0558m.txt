BELLAMY, Jacobus, a Dutch poet, was born at Flushing in 1757. He was apprenticed when young to a baker, but his abilities were discovered by a clergyman named De Water, who exerted himself in the boy’s behalf, and obtained sufficient assistance to send him, in 1782, to [9:3:544] the University of Utrecht. In 1785 appeared his Vaderlandsche Gézangen , which at once gained him the highest reputation as'a poet. Three years previously a small volume of his, Gezangen mijner Jeugd, published under the pseudonym Zelandus, had attracted considerable attention. His longest and, in the opinion of many, his best work is the poetic romance Roosje, 1784. Bellamy was one of the first to create a new and original literature in Holland; his songs have had wide circulation and great popularity.
