BASTAR, a feudatory state in the Central Provinces of British India, situated between 20° 10' and 17° 40' of N. lat., and 80° 30' and 82° 15' of E. long., bounded on the N. by the Kanker zamindâri and the Râipur district; on the E. by the Bend ré Nawâgarh zamïndâri and Râipur, Jaipur state, and Sabari River; on the S. by the Sironchâ district; and on the ^∖V. by the Indravatf River and the Aheri zamindâri. Extreme length of the state, 170 miles; extreme breadth, 120 miles; area, estimated at 13,000 square miles. Total population, 78,856, consisting of— Hindus, 29,060; Musalmâns, 1704; aboriginal tribes of Gond origin, 48,092. Among the latter, the Mariés are a [9:3:426] timid, quiet, docile race, and although addicted to drinking are not quarrelsome. They inhabit the densest jungles, and are very shy, avoiding contact with strangers, and flying to the hills on the least alarm; but they bear a good character for honesty and truthfulness. They are very scantily dressed, wear a variety of trinkets, with a knife, hatchet, spear, bow and arrow, the only weapons they use. Their hair is generally shaved, excepting a topknot; and tvhen not shaved it gets into a matted, tangled mass, gathered into a knot behind or on the crown. The Mhris, a class of the Markts, live in still denser jungles, and have little or no communication with the outside world. The Mâriâs and the Jhuriâs are supposed to be a subdivision of the true Gond family. All the aboriginal tribes of Bastâr worship the deities of the Hindu pantheon along with their own national goddess Danteswari.

The eastern part of Bastir is a flat elevated plateau, from 1600 to 2000 feet above the level of the sea, the centre and north-west portions are very mountainous, and the southern parts are a mixture of hill and plain. On the plateau there are but few hills; the streams run slowly, and the country is a mixture of plain and undulating ground covered by dense sàl forests. Principal mountains of the district—(1), A lofty range which separates it from the Sironcha district; (2), a range of equal height called the Bela Dili lying in the centre of the district; (3), a range running north and south near Niriyanpur; (4), Tdngri Dongri range, running east and west; (5), Tulsi Dongri, bordering on the Sabari River and the Jaipur state. There is also a small range running from the River Indravati to the Godavari. The Indravati, the Sabari, and the Til or Tilper, are the chief rivers of the district; all of them affluents of the Godavari The soil throughout the greater portion of Bastir consists of light clay, with an admixture of sand, suited for raising rice and wet crops. Rice, sugar, and a little wheat and gram are the agricultural products of Bastir. In the jungles the Marias and Maris rear kosri (Panicum italicum) and other inferior grains. The aboriginal races generally follow the migratory system of tillage, clearing the jungle on selected patches, and after taking crops for two or three years abandoning them for new ground. Min's do not use the plough; nor do they possess buffaloes, bullocks, or cows; their only agricultural implement is a long-handled iron hoe. Lac, resin, wax, galls, horns, rice, a red dye called scndrt, wild arrow-root, molasses, teakwood, and tasar-silk cocoons, are the chief staples of export. 'The imports, -which considerably exceed tho exports, consist of salt, piece-goods, brass utensils, cocoa-nuts, pepper, spices, opium, tuπneric, cotton, wheat, &c. Iron-ore is found towards the eastern portion of the state, but is not much worked; gold is also found in certain places. Bastir is divided into two portions—that held by the Raja or chief himself, and that possessed by feudatory chiefs under him. There is not a single made road within the principality. The climate of Bastar is unhealthy— fever, smallpox, dysentery, diarrhoea, and rheumatism being the prevailing diseases. Jagdalpur, Bijipur, Madder, and Bhupàlpatnam are the only places of any note in the dependency, the first-named being the residence of the Raja and the chief people of the state. The grossest ignorance and superstition prevail, and the people live in constant fear of being bewitched or ruined by malicious magicians. The family of the Raja of Bastar claims to be of the purest Rajput blood, and traces its origin to Warangal in the Dakhin, about the commencement of the 14th century. The revenue of Bastar is supposed to be £3610; the tribute paid by the chief to the British Government is £305, 12s.
