BIKÄNIR, a native state of Râjputânâ, under the political superintendence of the British Government, lies between 27° 30' and 29° 55' N. lat., and 72° 30' and 75° 40' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the Panjâb, on the E. by the British districts of Hariânâ and Shekâwati, on the S. by the native state of Jodhpur or Mârwâr, and on the W. by the native states of Jasalmér and Bhâwalpur. Length of the state from E. to W. 200 miles; breadth, 160 miles; area, 17,676 square miles. The natural aspect of the country is one desolate tract, without a single permanently running stream. Its surface is overspread with undulating sand-hills, of from 20 to 100 feet above the average level, and so loose that men and quadrupeds stepping off the beaten track sink as if in snow. Two streams, the Kâturi and Gâgar attempt to flow through this dismal region, but are lost in its sands. Water is very scarce, and is raised from wells of from 250 to 340 feet in depth. A few shallow salt lakes are filled by rain water, but they dry up on the setting in of hot weather, leaving a thick crust of salt on their beds, which is used for commercial and domestic purposes. The population of the state has been estimated at 539,000, consisting chiefly of Jâts, Râjputs (to which race the chief belongs), and other Hindu tribes, inhabiting 1814 villages, which, according to Elphinstone, are composed of “a few round huts of straw, with low walls and conical roofs, like little stacks of corn.” Bajrà and moth (two species of millet) and water melons are almost the only agricultural products. The inhabitants are very poor. They live chiefly by pasturage,—rearing camels, and horses of a fine breed, which fetch good prices. From the wool which their sheep yield they manufacture every article of native dress and good blankets. The other industries are leather work, sugar-refining, goldsmith’s work, iron, brass, copper, stone masonry, tanning, weaving, dyeing, and carpentry. In 1870-71 the total revenue amounted to £111,546, and the expenditure to £123,196. The state is in debt, and is said to be badly managed, the present Mahârâjâ being entirely guided by favourites. The military force of the state amounts to 5000 regulars, horse and foot. Bikânir was invaded by the adventurer George Thomas in 1799, who levied from the Râjâ a black mail of £20,000. The Râjâ entered into a treaty of dependence with the British Government in 1818. Principal towns— Bikânir, the capital, Churu, Râjgarh, Ratangarh, and Reni. The town of Bikânir is surrounded by a stone wall, 6 feet thick, 15 to 30 feet high, and 3∣ miles in circuit, with five gates and three sally-ports. Estimated population, 60,000. The citadel is half a mile north-east of the city, and is surrounded by a rampart with bastions.
