BINGHAM, Joseph, a learned scholar and divine, was born at Wakefield in Yorkshire, in September 1668. He was educated at University College, Oxford, of which he was made fellow in 1689, and college tutor in 1691. A sermon preached by him from the university pulpit, St Mary’s, on the meaning of the word “Person” in the Fathers, brought upon him a most unjust accusation of heresy. He was compelled to give up his fellowship and leave the university; but he was immediately presented by Dr John Radcliffe to the rectory of Headbournworthy, near Winchester. In this country retirement be began, his laborious and valuable work entitled Origines Ecclesiasticae, or Antiquities of the Christian Church, the first volume of which appeared in 1708 and the tenth in 1722. Notwithstanding his learning and merit, Bingham received no higher preferment than that of Headbournworthy till the year 1712, when he was collated to the rectory of Havant, near Portsmouth,by Sir Jonathan Trelawney,bishop of Winchester. Nearly all his little property was lost in the great South Sea bubble of 1720. He died August 17, 1723.
