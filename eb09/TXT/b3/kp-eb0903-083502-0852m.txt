BLOMFIELD, Chaeles James, bishop of London, was born on the 29th May 1786, at Bury-St-Edmund’s. He received his first education at his father’s school in that, town, and was then transferred to the grammar school,, where, under the able instruction of the Rev. M. T. Becher, he laid the foundations of an unusually sound and thorough classical scholarship. His career at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1804, was brilliant. He gained the Browne medals for Latin and Greek odes, and carried off the Craven scholarship. In 1808 he graduated as third wrangler and first medallist, and in the following year was elected to a fellowship at Trinity College. The first-fruits of his scholarship was an edition of the Prometheus of Aeschylus, in 1810; this was followed by editions of the Septem contra Thebas, Persoe, Choephoeroe, and Agamemnon, of Callimachus, and of the fragments of Sappho, Sophron, and Alcaeus. Blomfield, however, soon ceased to devote himself to mere scholarship. He had been ordained in 1810, and held for a short time the curacy of Chesterford. He was then presented to the rectory of Quarrington, and shortly afterwards to that of Dunton, in Buckinghamshire, where he remained for about five years. In 1817 he was moved to the benefices of Great and Little Chesterford and Tuddenham, and he was in the same year appointed private chaplain to Howley, .bishop of London. In 1819 he was nominated by Lord Liverpool to the rich living of St Botolph’s, Bishopsgate, and in 1822 [9:3:836] he became archdeacon of Colchester. Two years later he was raised to the bishopric of Chester, and in that position began his career of incessant labour for the advancement of the church. Many reforms, were needed in the diocese, and the new bishop’s energy and ardour succeeded in effecting much, though not without stirring up enemies. In 1828 he was transferred to a wider sphere of activity, being raised to the bishopric of London. This important office he held for eight-and-twenty years, labouring incessantly in a field where unremitting exertion was absolutely necessary. He gave his whole heart to the endeavour to extend the influence and efficiency of the church, and his strenuous activity was not without result. In all political or social movements which concerned the church the bishop took a prominent part. He was noted as being one of the best debaters on the episcopal bench in the House of Lords; he took a leading position in the action for church reform, which culminated in the Ecclesiastical Commission; and he did much for the extension of the colonial episcopate. His health gave way under his unceasing labours, and in 1856 he was permitted to resign his bishopric, retaining Fulham palace as his residence, along with a pension of £6000 per annum. He died at Fulham on the 5th August 1857. In private lite Blomfield was warm-hearted, genial, and kindly; he was fond of travelling and of intellectual society, in which he was well qualified to shine. His published works, exclusive of those above mentioned, consist of charges, sermons, lectures, and pamphlets, and of a Manual of Private and Family Prayers. He was a frequent contributor to the quarterly reviews, chiefly on classical subjects. An admirable memoir has been published by the bishop’s son, Memoirs of Charles James Blomfield, D.D., Bishop of London, with Selections from his Correspondence, edited by his son, Alfred Blomfield, M.A., &c., 1863. See also Biber, Bishop Blomfield and his Times, 1857.
