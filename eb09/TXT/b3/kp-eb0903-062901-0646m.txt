BHATNIÂR, or Bhattis, a people of the northern part of Hindustan, inhabiting the tract of country now included within the British district of Hissar, formerly called Bhatiânâ, the eastern frontier of which is situated 125 miles north-west of Dehli. The Bhattis present many peculiarities in manners and customs, distinguishing them from the other people of Hindustân. They consist of two distinct races—the one being composed of Mahometans of Râjput descent, who constitute the influential class, and who report among themselves that their ancestors emigrated some centuries ago from the district of Jasalmir, and after various vicissitudes settled in the Bhatniâr country; the other comprising the common people, known as Jâts, who have adopted the religion of their superiors, and are consequently treated with great moderation. Most of these people are descended from dwellers on the western bank of the Satlej, who were invited by a Râjâ of the Bhattis to cross the river and settle in his country. Though tillers of the soil, the Bhattis are more generally characterized as shepherds; and though they are mostly restricted to the territory whence their name is derived, various tribes of them are to be found in the Panjâb, and they are also scattered over the high grounds to the east of the Indus.

Notwithstanding they are Mahometans, their customs are in some respects at variance with those observed by the majority of the followers of the prophet, particularly in the females appearing, without reserve, unveiled in public, and in their associating openly with the men. The wives of the Râjput chiefs form an exception.

The territory above described, anterior to British sway, was under the dominion of a prince or Râjâ, whose authority was acknowledged by inferior chiefs. This potentate could bring 20,000 or 30,000 men into the field, but they were quite undisciplined, and despised the necessary principle of subordination. His revenue arose chiefly from the plunder his troops secured; for their wars were directed more to predatory purposes than to open contest, and the Râjâ, instead of repressing the ravages of this immense banditti, willingly participated in the spoils.

While under the influence of native rule the Bhattis appear to have formed a collection of hordes of freebooters. They have been described as of a cruel, savage, and ferocious disposition, entertaining an abhorrence of the usages of civilized life—thieves from their earliest infancy, and during their predatory incursions into the neighbouring districts, not scrupling, though unresisted, to add murder to robbery.

Many of the Bhattis appear to be constantly changing their residence from place to place as subsistence fails. Their exports are horses, camels, bullocks, buffaloes, and ghi; occasionally they sell some surplus grain above what is necessary for their own consumption, but their traffic is very inconsiderable. A large portion of the country is unproductive, but along the banks of the River Ghâgar, from Bhatniâr to the town of Sirsâ, and also in the vicinity of the Naiwâl (Nalâ, or watercourse), the soil is uncommonly rich, and well adapted for cultivation. The inundations of these rivers fertilize their banks, and the subsidence of the waters leaves a broad margin prepared for plentiful crops of wheat, rice, and barley, which amply reward the labours of the husbandman.

The former capital of the Bhattis was Bhatniâr, which lies in a situation almost inaccessible to an enemy, for no water is to be procured within 12 miles but what supplies the inhabitants. It was taken, however, in 1398 by Timur, more recently by the military adventurer George Thomas, and finally in 1805 by the Râjâ of Bikânir, who still retains authority over it. The principal town is Sirsâ, between which and Bhâwalpur a route for commercial purposes has been opened. Numbers of the Bhattis have-emigrated from their native country to establish themselves in the western parts of the dominions of Oudh; and several families of them are to be met with in Rohilkhand. They are practised travellers, and well trained to emigration by the laborious journeys undertaken in crossing the great desert to the west of their territories. During the independence of their native rulers, expeditions were frequently made in large parties for the purpose of predatory incursions on peaceable countries more remote; and these banditti displayed both skill and determination in attaining their object. Camels previously laden with provisions were despatched to different stations in the desert, which is about 130 miles in breadth, and their loads deposited there. The most intelligent of the party about to follow were then selected as guides, and enforced the most implicit obedience on their companions during the journey, which closed at the frontier of the hostile country, or rather that against which their hostility was directed. The guides by long experience became expert without compass or landmark, and seldom failed to conduct the party to the appointed station where the provisions were deposited, and thence across the remainder of the desert in safety. If accidentally they missed the points of rendezvous, or those where alone their necessities could be relieved, they were exposed to inevitable destruction. The adventurers steered their course by the sun in the day-time, and by the polar star at night; and by similar aids they were enabled to retrace the way they had travelled.

The history of the Bhattis has attracted the notice of few European authors. They seem to have carried on frequent wars with neighbouring states, and were the most formidable enemies opposed to the Râjâ of Bikânir. The latter, however, invaded their territories in the beginning of the present century, and obtained some temporary advantages. He erected a fortress in Batinda, now a possession of the Râjâ of Patiâlâ, and this contributed to overawe them for a time, and repressed their incursions into his own dominions, as, independently of the garrison, he stationed a large body of cavalry in the fort, whose frequent sallies and captures of cattle annoyed the Bhattis so much that they contemplated a total emigration from their own country. But George Thomas, the military adventurer already noticed, an Irishman by birth, who, endowed with singular talents and intrepidity, had founded for himself an independent state in the north-west of India, was then at war with the province of Bikânir. Having reached its frontiers, the Bhattis solicited his alliance, and, to induce him to espouse their cause the more readily, offered him 40,000 rupees if he would reduce the obnoxious [9:3:630] fort. In the prosecution of the war several actions ensued, and various fortresses were taken; but it would appear that one of the Bhatti chiefs at variance with General Thomas commenced hostilities against him about the period now alluded to; and in this new warfare with his late allies his forces were so much reduced by repeated encounters, that, being scarcely able to stand an engagement, he fortified his camps. The Bhattis, after frequent attacks, withdrew their troops by night; whereupon General Thomas took and burned Fathiâbâd and other places, and might have occupied the whole country, had not a neighbouring chief concluded an alliance with the Bhattis, and seDt 1000 cavalry to their aid. General Thomas retreated to Jaijar, a town within his own territory, leaving the Bhattis in possession of their capital

The triumphs of the British arms proved fatal to the European adventurers who at that period had established themselves in Northern India, and the arrangements made with Sindia brought the British into contact with the country of the Bhattis, against whom they were compelled in 1810 to march a force, which expelled the chief, and transferred the greater part of the territory to his son, who had voluntarily proceeded to the British camp.
