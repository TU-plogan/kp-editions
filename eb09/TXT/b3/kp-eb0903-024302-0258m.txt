+====================================================================+


BAILLIE, Dr Matthew, anatomist and physician, was born in the manse of Shotts, Lanarkshire, in 1761. He came of a highly gifted family: his father, the Rev. James Baillie, was successively clergyman of the parishes of Shotts, Bothwell, and Hamilton, in Lanarkshire, and afterwards professor of divinity in the university of Glasgow; his mother was Dorothea, sister of the celebrated William and John Hunter; and his sister Joanna was the poet. Dr Baillie was for several years a student in the university of Glasgow, where he heard the lectures of Dr Reid on moral philosophy. His professional career was determined by the advice of his uncle, Dr William Hunter, who undertook to superintend his education. On his father’s death he obtained an exhibition to Balliol College, Oxford, where he remained a year before removing to London. His studies were there carried on under the personal direction of his uncle, and after two years he began to be associated with Dr Hunter in his anatomical lectures as an assistant and demonstrator, visiting Oxford occasionally, so as to keep the terms necessary for the degree of bachelor of medicine. Dr Hunter, at his death, bequeathed the use of his magnificent collections to his nephew, together with the lecture-rooms in Windmill Street, an annuity of £100 a year, and a small family estate in Scotland. The last was resigned by Baillie to his other uncle, Dr John Hunter, whom he considered as the natural heir. Within two years after Dr Hunter’s death his nephew became the principal teacher in that celebrated school of anatomy; and in 1787, although only a bachelor of medicine, he was appointed physician to St George’s Hospital. In 1789 he married Sophia, daughter of the eminent accoucheur Dr Denman, a connection favourable to his practice. In 1795 he published his Morbid Anatomy, a work which was speedily translated into French, Italian, and German, into the last by the anatomist Sömmering. After this he had the honour of being enrolled a doctor of medicine of Oxford, and Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. As a practising physician he was universally respected, and his decease, which took place on the 23d of September 1823, in the 63d year of his age, was sincerely regretted.

The second edition of the Morbid Anatomy appeared in 1797; and two years afterwards it was illustrated by a 4to volume of engravings, with descriptions of the plates. His Anatomical Lectures and Medical Observations were printed privately after his death. The Works, 2 vols. 8vo, edited, with a biographical sketch, by Mr Wardrop, contain only the Morbid Anatomy and miscellaneous medical papers.
