BARNABAS (∏Ni∏Γ">2) was the surname given by the apostles to Joses, “a Levite, of the country of Cyprus,” who, though like Paul not of the twelve, was with him recognized among the number of the apostles. The name (υloς τrαpακλ^σ∈ωs), translated ii son of consolation” in the authorized version (Acts iv. 36), would be better rendered [9:3:378] a son of exhortation” or “of prophecy.” Barnabas is first mentioned in the Acts (iv. 36, 37) as having sold his land and laid the money at the apostles’ feet. He next appears as introducing Paul after his conversion to the other apostles (Acts ix. 27), from which a previous acquaintance has been iuferred. Subsequent notices record a year’s residence along with Saul at Antioch, where they “taught much people” (xi. 22-26), a visit to Jerusalem with contributions for the poorer brethren there (xi. 27-30), the ordination of Saul and Barnabas for the work to which they were called by the Holy Ghost (xiii. 2, 3), and a missionary journey of the two apostles to Cyprus and various cities of Asia Minor (xiii. xiv.) When the dissension arose as to the necessity of circumcision, Paul and Barnabas were sent to Jerusalem by the church at Antioch to consult the “apostles and elders” on the question (xv. 1-4). Soon after their return to Antioch they resolved to undertake a second missionary journey; but a difference arose between them in regard to the determination of Barnabas to take his sister’s son, John Mark, along with him. “The contention was so sharp between them” (xv. 39) that they separated, Barnabas and Mark going to Cyprus, while Paul and Silas went to Syria and Cilicia. No further account of the career of Barnabas is given in the New Testament, with the exception of one or two incidental allusions in St Paul’s epistles (1 Cor. ix. 6; Gal. ii. 1, 9, 13). Later writings and traditions have attempted to supply what is wanting in the Scriptural narrative, but they contain no facts that can be accepted as historically certain. According to Clement of Alexandria, Barnabas was one of the seventy disciples. Various accounts of still later date allege that he studied under Gamaliel along with Saul, that he suffered martyrdom at Cyprus, and that his body was discovered in the reign of the Emperor Zeno. He is also said to have been the founder and first bishop of the church at Milan. The festival of St Barnabas is held on the 11th of June.
