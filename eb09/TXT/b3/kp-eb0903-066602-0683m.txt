BIDP Al, more commonly known under the corrupted name of Pilpay, is the supposed author of a famous collection of Hindu fables. Nothing is known of Bidpai beyond the name, which, indeed, occurs only in the Arabic version, but the history of the collection of stories is curious and interesting. The origin of them is undoubtedly to be found in the Pantcha Tantra, or Five Sections, an extensive body of fables or apologues. A second collection, called the Hitopadesa, has become more widely known in Europe than the first, on which it is apparently founded. In the 6th century a.d., a translation into Pehlvi of a number of these old fables was made by Barzuyeh, a physician at the court of Nush⅛van, king of Persia. No traces of this Persian translation can now be found, but nearly two centuries later, Abdallah-ibn-Mokaffah translated the Persian into Arabic; and his version, which is known as the “Book of Kalilah and Dimna,” from the two jackals in the first story, became the channel through which a knowledge of the fables was transmitted to Europe. It was translated into Greek by Simeon Sethus towards the close of the 11th century; his version, however, does not appear to have been retranslated into any other European language. But the Hebrew version of Rabbi Joel, made somewhat later, was translated into Latin by John of Capua, and in that form became widely known. Since then the fables have been translated into nearly every European tongue. There are also versions of them in the modern Persian, Malay, Mongol, and Afghan languages.
