BAMBOROUGH, a village in Northumberland, on the sea-coast, 14 miles N. of Alnwick. It was a royal borough previous to the Norman Conquest, and returned two members to parliament in the 23d year of Edward I. Its ancient castle stands close to the sea on an almost perpendicular rock, 150 feet in height, and is accessible only on the south-east side. The first erection is ascribed by the Saxon chronicles to King Ida of Northumberland, who is said to have named it Bebbanburh after his queen Bebbe (547 A.D.) The principal events in its early history are the siege by Penda in 642, the ravages of the Danes in 993, the unsuccessful defence by De Mowbray against William Rufus, and numerous sieges during the Wars of the Roses. In the reign of Henry VII. it fell into decay. At length, in the 18th century, it became the property of Lord Crewe, bishop of Durham, who, in 1720, vested the castle and manor in trustees for charitable purposes. In virtue of this bequest a patrol is kept on the coast, apartments are provided for shipwrecked seamen, and a storehouse for salvage-goods, and granaries are maintained in order to supply corn to the poor at a cheap rate in times of scarcity. An infirmary, a dispensary, and a large library bequeathed by Dr Sharp, are also maintained, while poor children receive gratuitous education at two “national” schools. Population in 1871,320 in the village, and 3751 in the parish.
