BARCLAY, William, LL.D., a writer on civil law, was born in Aberdeenshire in the year 1541. He spent the early part of his life, and much of his fortune, at the court of Mary queen of Scots, from whose favour he had reason to expect preferment. In 1573 he went over to Prance, and at Bourges began to study civil law under the famous Cuja3. He continued some years in that seminary, where he took his doctor’s degree; and was soon after appointed professor of civil law in the university of Pont-à-Mousson, recently founded by the duke of Lorraine. The prince afterwards made him counsellor of state and master of requests. In the year 1581 Barclay married Anne de Malleville, a French lady. Their son was the celebrated John Barclay, author of the Ärgernis. This youth the Jesuits would gladly have received into their society; but his father refused his consent, and thereby incurred their bitter enmity. He was compelled to leave France, and returned to Britain, where King James offered him a considerable preferment, provided he would become a member of the Church of England. He would not accept the post on this condition, and went back again to France in 160 L Soon after his arrival he was appointed first professor of the civil law in the University of Angers, where he died the year following, and was buried in the Franciscan church. Barclay was a man of considerable ability, and his legal writings are still valued. In his political opinions he was directly opposed to his illustrious countryman Buchanan, and was a strenuous defender of the rights of kings; his own speculations on the principles of government are best known to some from an incidental confutation by Locke, in his Treatises on Government. His most important writings w ere :—

De Regno et Regali Potestate, adversus Bucliananum, Brutum, Boucherium, et reliquos Monarchomachos, libri sex, Paris, 1600, 4to; In Titulum Pandectarum de Rebus creditis et Jurejurando Commentarii, Paris, 1605, 8vo; De Potestate Paqoae ; an et quatenus in Reges et Principes scculares jus et imperium habeat: Liber post· humus, Mussiponti, 1610, 8vo. This work was translated into French, and an English version is printed with the treatise of Sheldon, Of the Lawfulness of the Oath of Allegiance, Lond. 1611, 4to. Barclay’s two treatises, De Regno and De Potestate Papoc, have repeatedly been printed in the same volume: Hanover, lt>12, 8vo; Hanover, 1617, 8vo.
