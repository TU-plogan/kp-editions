BENTINCK, Lord William George Frederick Cavendish, better known as Lord George Bentinck, the second son of the fourth duke of Portland, by Henrietta, sister to the Viscountess Canning, was born February 27, 1802. He was educated at Eton, and at Christ Church, Oxford; after which he entered the army, and served for several years in the Guards. On retiring from the army, he acted for some time as private secretary to his uncle Mr Canning, then prime minister; in which capacity he gave proofs of high ability for the conduct of public business. In 1828 he succeeded his uncle Lord William Bentinck as member for Lynn-Regis, and continued to represent that constituency during the remaining twenty years of his life. Till within three years of his death Lord George Bentinck was little known out of the sporting world. His early attempts at public speaking afforded no indication of the abilities which the subsequent course of political events served to develop so conspicuously. His failures in the House of Commons seem to have discouraged him from the attempt to acquire reputation as a politician. The natural energy of his character, however, found scope in another arena. As one of the leaders on “the turf,” he was there distinguished by that integrity, judgment, and indomitable determination, which, when brought to bear upon matters of weightier importance, placed him, with a rapidity almost unexampled, in the foremost rank of British senators. On his first entrance into parliament he belonged to what may be called the moderate Whig party, and voted in favour of Catholic emancipation, as also for the Reform Bill, though he opposed some of its principal details. Soon after, however, he joined the ranks of the Opposition, with whom he sided up to the important era of 1846. When, in that year, Sir Robert Peel openly declared in favour of free-trade, the advocates of the corn-laws, then without a leader, after several ineffectual attempts at organization, discovered that Lord George Bentinck was the only man around whom the several sections of the Opposition could· be brought to rally. His sudden elevation to so prominent a position took the public mind by surprise; but he soon gave convincing evidence of powers so formidable, that the position of the Protectionist party at once assumed an imposing aspect. Towards Sir Robert Peel, in particular, his hostility was marked and uncompromising. Believing, as he himself expressed it, that that statesman and his political colleagues had “hounded to the death his illustrious relative” Mr Canning, he combined with his opposition as a political leader a degree of personal animosity that gave additional force to the poignancy of his invectives. On entering on his new position, he at once abandoned his favourite pursuits, disposed of his magnificent stud, forsook all connection with the turf, and devoted his whole time and energies to the laborious and trying duties of a parliamentary leader. Apart from the question of the cornlaws, his politics were strictly independent. In opposition· to the rest of his party, he supported the bill for removing the Jewish disabilities, and was favourable to the scheme for the payment of the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland by the landowners. As he had held no high office under Government, his qualifications as a statesman never found scope beyond the negative achievements of a leader of Opposition; but it may be safely affirmed that nothing but his untimely death could have debarred him from acquiring a distinguished position among the statesmen of Britain. This event, caused by the rupture of a vessel in the heart, took place suddenly on the 21st September 1848, while his lordship was proceeding on foot to.visit a friend in the country.—(See Lord George Bentinck; a Poli· tical Biography, by B. Disraeli, 1851.)
