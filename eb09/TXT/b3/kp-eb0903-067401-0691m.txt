BILLETING. The law as to billeting soldiers is regulated by the provisions of the Annual Mutiny Act (38 Vict. c. 7, §§ 63-67). Constables of parishes and places, police officers, high constables, and other chief officers and magistrates may billet officers and soldiers on actual service, with their horses and baggage, in victualling house, inn, hotel, livery stable, ale-house, or the "house of any seller of wine by retail to be drunk in such house, or the houses of persons selling brandy, spirits, strong waters, cider, or metheglin by retail; but no officer or soldier shall be billeted in any private houses, or in any canteen under the authority of the War Department, nor on persons keeping taverns only being vintners of the city of London, nor on distillers, nor on shopkeepers whose principal dealing is more in other goods than in brandy and strong waters, so as such distillers and shopkeepers do not permit tippling in such houses. If the victualler has not sufficient accommodation in his own house he must find it in the immediate neighbourhood. The following sums are allowed as compensation :—For hot meal, to be supplied each day to soldiers on the march, 10d., with 2⅜d. for a bed; for other soldiers, entitled to bed, candles, use of fire and cooking utensils, 4d. per diem for each soldier; for ten pounds of oats, twelve of hay, and eight of straw, Is. 9d. per diem. Military officers must not act as justices in billeting.
