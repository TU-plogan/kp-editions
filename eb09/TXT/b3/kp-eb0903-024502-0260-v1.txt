BAILY, Francis, an English astronomer, was born in Berkshire in the year 1774, and for many years carried on business as a stockbroker in London. While amassing a large fortune by his business, he applied the profound mathematical knowledge for which he was distinguished to the doctrine of probabilities, and published several interesting works on that subject, as, Tables for the Purchasing and Renewing of Leases, The Doctrine of Interest and Annuities, The Doctrine of Annuities and Assurances, <fcc. In 1820 he was one of the original and most active promoters of the Astronomical Society; and on his retirement from business in 1825, he entered with the utmost energy upon the cultivation of astronomy and the kindred sciences. He gave the Nautical Almanac its present form and introduced other improvements; he took an active part in the investigation of the effects of the atmosphere on pendulum experiments; he aided in the repetition of the experiment of Cavendish on the specific gravity of the earth; he superintended the publication of the Astronomical Society’s catalogue of the fixed stars; and the revision of the annual catalogues in the 13th volume of the Society’s Memoirs was entirely his work. On his recommendation the British Association undertook the republication of the Histoire Céleste of Lalande, combined with Lacaille’s catalogue, which together contain no less than 57,000 stars; and there is reason to believe that he took an important part in the investigation of the course of the tidal wave in the Atlantic. His Account of the Rev. John Flamsteed, First Astronomer-Royal, 1835, a work of great ability and research, excited much discussion from the disclosures it made relative to the character of Sir Isaac Newton. Baily was extremely patient and methodical, and these qualities enabled him to effect, in the last twenty years of his career, a greater number of researches than most other philosophers have accomplished during a whole lifetime. He died August 30, 1844.
