BIEL (or in French Bienne), a town of the canton of Bern, in Switzerland, situated at the foot of the Jura Mountains, near the northern end of the lake to which it gives its name. It is well built, and possesses a town-house of some antiquity, a remarkable church, a hospital, a gymnasium, and an industrial school. There is considerable industrial activity in Biel, especially in the manufacture of cotton, leather, iron wire, and watches. Founded in the 11th or 12th century, Biel continued under the authority of the bishopric of Basel till the beginning of the 15 th, when it formed an alliance with Bern, Soleure, and Freiburg. Its defence against the French in 1798 is commemorated by an obelisk on a neighbouring eminence. Its incorporation with Basel dates from 1815. Population, 8113.
