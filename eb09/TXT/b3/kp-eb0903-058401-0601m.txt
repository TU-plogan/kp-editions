BÉRARD, Frédéric, a French physician and writer on psychology, was born at Montpellier in 1789. He was educated at the famous medical school of that town, and afterwards proceeded to Paris, where he was for some time employed in connection with the Dictionnaire des Sciences Médicales. He returned to his native city in 1816, and published a work upon the principles of the school of Montpellier. In 1823 he was called to a chair of medicine at Paris, which he held for three years, being then nominated professor of hygiene at Montpellier. His health gave way under his labours, and he died, in 1828, at the early age of 39. A posthumous work, Esprit des Doctrines Médicales de Montpellier, was printed in 1830. Bérard’s most important production is his treatise, Des Rapports dιi Physique et dτι Moral. According to him, consciousness or internal perception reveals to us the existence of an immaterial thinking, feeling, and willing subject, the self or soul. Alongside of this there is the vital force, the nutritive power, which uses the physical frame as its organ. The soul and the principle of life are in constant reciprocal action, and the first owes to the second, not the formation of its faculties, but the conditions under which they are evolved.
