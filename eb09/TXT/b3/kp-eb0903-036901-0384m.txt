BARCLAY, John, a distinguished scholar and writer, was born, January 28, 1582, at Pont-à-Mousson, where his father William Barclay (see below) was professor of civil law. Educated at the Jesuits’ college, he gave evidence of remarkable ability at an early age, and was only nineteen when he published a commentary upon the Thebais of Statius. The Jesuits w ere naturally desirous that he should enter their order, but to this both himself and his father were averse. The jealous enmity of the order was roused against them in consequence of this refusal, and in 1603 both left France and crossed over to England. In the following year they returned and settled at Angers, where Barclay’s father had been appointed professor of law. Soon after the death of his father in 1605, Barclay appears to have married, and to have settled in London, where in 1606 he published the second part of his Satyricon, the first part having appeared on his previous visit to England. In 1610 he edited an important treatise left by his father, De Potestate Papoe, which involved him in controversy with the famous Cardinal Bellarmin. In 1614 appeared the w ittiest and most interesting part of the Satyricon, entitled Icon Animorum, which gives a critical survey of the varied manners and characteristics of the several European nations. It has been frequently reprinted. In 1616, after a short stay in Paris, he proceeded to Rome, where he continued to reside till his death on 12th August 1621. His romance, Ar genis, was passing through the press at the period of his death, and it appeared in the course of the same year.. Barclay, from what reason is not apparent, failed to attain the position to which his talents seemed fairly to entitle him. His reputation as a writer and scholar was remarkably high among his contemporaries. Grotius and others have lavished praises on the purity and elegance of his Latin style; his romance was extremely popular; and some of his Latin poems are very happy. The idea of the Satyricon, one of his two extensive compositions, is borrowed from Petronius; in the details, however, the work fortunately does not follow that author so closely. It was very extensively read, and has passed through several editions. The Ar genis, a long Latin romance, sometimes looked on as a political allegory, was very popular. It is said to have been w armly admired by Richelieu and Leibnitz, while Cowper, Disraeli, and Coleridge speak of it in terms of high admiration. The value that was put upon it by Barclay’s contemporaries and immediate successors may be gathered from the critical estimate of it given in the Vita Barclaii, prefixed to later editions of the work. “ Habet enim," says the anonymous writer of the life, “ heroicum Tullii vigorem, Laconismum et politicam Taciti, Livii antiquitatem, flosculos puros Petronii, sales fabulosos Nasonis, poeticam Alaronica vix inferiorem.” There have been numerous editions of the book, -which has been translated into almost every European language.
