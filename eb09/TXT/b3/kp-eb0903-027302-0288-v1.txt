BALBO, Cesare, an important Italian writer and statesman, was born at Turin, November 21, 1789. His father, Prospero Balbo, held a high position in the Piedmontese court, and at the time of Cesare’s birth was syndic of the capital. His mother, a member of the Azeglio family, died when he was three years old; and he was brought up in the house of his great-grandmother, the countese of Bugino, “a noble and proud old lady.” In 1798 he joined his father at Paris. Erom 1808 to 1814 Balbo served ’in various capacities under the Napoleonic empire, helping, at Florence and Rome, to fix the chains of despotism on his country. Gradually, however, his eyes were opened, and, on the fall of Napoleon, he was ready, in various capacities, to serve the cause of his country. While his father was appointed minister of the interior, he entered the army, and undertook political missions to Paris and London. On the revolution of 1821 he was forced into exile, and though, not long after, he was allowed to return to Piedmont, all active service as a statesman was denied him. Reluctantly, and with frequent endeavours to obtain some appointment, he gave himself up to literature as the only means left him to influence the destinies of his country. This accounts for the fitfulness and incompleteness of so much of his literary work, and for the practical, and in many cases temporary, element that runs through even his most elaborate productions. The great object of his labours was to help in securing for Italy that independence from foreign control which, even more than internal freedom, he regarded as the first necessity of national life. Of true Italian unity he had no expectation and no desire. A confederation of separate states under the supremacy of the Pope was the genuine beau idéal of Balbo, as it was the ostensible beau idéal of Gioberti. But Gioberti, in his P rimato, seemed to him to neglect the first essential of independence, which he accordingly inculcated in his Speranze or Hopes of Italy. Preparation, both military and moral, alertness, and patience, were his constant theme. He did not wish revolution, but reform; and thus he became the leader of a moderate party, and the steady opponent not only of despotism but of democracy. At last, in 1848, his hopes were so far satisfied by the constitution granted by the king. He was appointed a member of the commission of electoral law, and held a post in the first reformed government. With the ministry of Azeglio, which soon after got into power, he continued on friendly terms, and his pen continued the active defence of his political principles till his death, on the 3d June 1853. The most important of his writings are historico-political, and derive at once their majesty and their weakness from his theocratic theory of Christianity. His style is clear and vigorous, and not unfrequently terse and epigrammatic. He published Quattro Novelle in 1829; Storia d’Italia in 1830, Vita di Dante, 1839; Meditazioni Storiche, 1842-5; Le Speranze d’Italia, 1843; Somτnario della Storia d’Italia.
