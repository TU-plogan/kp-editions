BAMBERG, a town of Bavaria, in the circle of Upper Franconia, on the River Regnitz, 3 miles above its junction with the Maine, and 33 miles N. of Nuremberg, with which it is connected by railway. It is partially surrounded by walls and ditches, and is divided by the river and Ludwig’s canal into three districts, which are connected by handsome bridges. The town is well built, and the streets are well paved and lighted. The cathedral, a noble structure in the Byzantine style of architecture, is surpassed by few of the kind in Germany. It was founded in 1004 by the Emperor Henry IL, and finished in 1012, but was afterwards partially burnt, and rebuilt in 1110. It contains the tombs of the founder and his empress Cunigunde, Conrad III., Pope Clement IL, Ac., and numerous monuments and paintings by eminent masters. Among the other public buildings are St Martin’s church, the palace (formerly the residence of the prince-bishops), town-house, and theatre. The Benedictine convent of St Michael was turned, in 1803, into a charitable institution for poor citizens known as Ludwig’s hospital. Bamberg has numerous literary and charitable institutions, as the lyceum, gymnasium, polytechnic, normal, and medical schools, a library, museum, picture-gallery, hospital, and workhouse. The trade is considerable; cloths, sealing-wax, leather, tobacco, musical instruments, carriages, Ac., are manufactured, and there are numerous breweries. The whole of the neighbouring district is like a vast garden, and furnishes large supplies of liquorice, carrots, aniseed, coriander, and other seeds. Bamberg was formerly the capital of an independent bishopric, which was secularized in 1801, and assigned to Bavaria in 1803. Population, 25,738.
