BAR-HEBRAeUS. See Abulfaragius, vol. i. p. 60. i BAR-LE-DUC, or Bar-sur·Ornain, the chief town of the department of Meuse in France. It occupies the declivity and base of a hill, in lat. 48° 46' 8* N., long. 5° 9' 47" E,, f on the River Ornain, a tributary of the Marne, 125 miles E. of Paris, and consists of an upper and lower town, the latter being the more modern and respectable of the two. It is a railway station on the Paris-and-Strasburg line, and the Marne-and-Rhine canal passes in the immediate vicinity. A college, a normal school, a society of agriculture and arts, and a public library, are among its educational institutions. The only building of mark is the church of St Pierre, which contains a curious figure of a half decayed body in white marble, originally forming part of the mausoleum of René of Chalons, Prince of Orange. The castle, which formed the nucleus of the upper town, was built by Frederick I., duke of Lorraine, in the 10th century. Louis XI. got possession of the place and caused it to be fortified in 1474. It was dismantled under Louis XIV. in 1670, but retains a few relics of the ancient works. An extensive traffic is maintained in wood, wine, and wool; and the manufactures of cotton stuffs, hats, hosiery, leather, and confections, are considerable, the last-mentioned article being especially celebrated. Population in 1872, 15,175. The district of Bar was governed by a series of counts from 959 to 1354, when it was raised to a duchy, which.in 1419 was ceded to René of Anjou, and henceforward followed the fortunes of Lorraine. The motto of the dukes, which has been adopted by the town, was Plus penser que dire. Their coins were usually distinguished by two barbels.
