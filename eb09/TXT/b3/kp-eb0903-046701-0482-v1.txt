BEAUCAIRE (i.e., Bellum Quadrum, the beautiful square), a town of France, department of Gard, and arrondissement of Nîmes. Lat. 43° 48' 32" N., long. 4° 38' 50" E. It is situated on the right bank of the Rhone, opposite Tarascon, with which it is connected by a magnificent suspension-bridge of four spans and 1456 feet in length. The town is generally well built, but has no public buildings worthy of notice, and the streets are narrow and crooked. Its ancient castle of Bellicadro is now in ruins. It gives name to the canal which communicates with the sea, and also connects it with the Languedoc canal, forming part of the line of communication between the Rhone and the Garonne. It is also connected with Nîmes and Alais by a railway opened iu 1839. The manufactures are few and unimportant. The town derives its celebrity from the great July fair, which has been held here annually since the 13th (or 14th) century, and to which merchants come from all parts of Europe, and even from Persia and Armenia. The extensive meadow, called Magdalen's, on the banks of the Rhone, is set apart for the gathering, and almost every kind of article, whether of convenience or luxury, is there exhibited. Though the fair is now less frequented than formerly, it 13 said that still as many as 100,000 persons attend. There are stone quarries in the neighbourhood of the town, and the manufacture of linen and-woollen stuffs is carried on. Population in 1872, 7858.

Bcaucaire occupies the site of the ancient Ugernum, and several remains of the Roman city have been discovered, as well as (in 1734) the road that led from Nîmes. It was a fortress in the Middle Ages, and belonged in succession to the counts of Arles, the archbishops of Arles, the counts of Toulouse, and the viscounts of Narbonne. In the 12th century it is frequently mentioned by the troubadours. Presented in 1215 to Simon de Montfort, it was next year taken possession of by Count Raimund VI.; and in 1226 Louis VIII. made himself master of it. In the wars of the League it suffered severely, and in 1632 its castle was destroyed by Richelieu.
