BECK, or Beek, David, an eminent portrait painter, born in 1621, at Arnheim in Guelderland. He was trained by Vandyck, from whom he acquired the fine manner of pencilling and sweet style of colouring peculiar to that great master. He possessed likewise that freedom of hand and readiness, or rather rapidity of execution, for which Vandyck was so remarkable, insomuch that when King Charles I. observed the expeditious manner of Beck’s painting, he exclaimed, “Faith! Beck, I believe you could paint riding post.” He was appointed portrait-painter and chamberlain to Queen Christina of Sweden, and he executed portraits of most of the sovereigns of Europe to adorn her gallery. He lived in the highest favour with his royal mistress, and with difficulty obtained a short leave of absence from her court. He died soon after (1656) at the Hague, not without suspicion of having been poisoned.
