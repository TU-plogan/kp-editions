BECKER, Wilhelm Adolf, a classical archaeologist of distinction, was born at Dresden in 1796. He was at first destined for a commercial life, but was, in 1812, sent to the celebrated school at Pforta, whence, in 1816, he passed to the University of Leipsic. Here he had the good fortune to study under the famous Hermann. After holding subordinate posts at Zerbst and Meissen, he was, in 1836, appointed extraordinary professor of classical archaeology at Leipsic; and six years later he was raised to the professorship of antiquities in the same university. He died at Meissen in September 1846. The w orks by which Becker is most widely known are the Gallus, oder römische Scenen aus der Zeit des Augustus, 1838, and the Charicles, oder Bilder altgriechischen Sitte, 1840. The author show’s not only a complete mastery of Greek and Roman antiquities, but a very happy faculty of imparting life to the dry bones of the science. Both works have been translated into English. Perhaps more useful for scholars is the great Handbuch der röm. Alterthümer, 5 vols. (1843-64), completed after Becker’s death by Marquardt, and of which a second and enlarged edition is now in course of publication.
