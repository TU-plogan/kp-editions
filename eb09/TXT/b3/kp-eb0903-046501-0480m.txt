BÉARN, formerly a small frontier province in the south of France, now included within the department of Basses-Pyrénées, was bounded on the W. by Soule and Lower Navarre, on the N. by Chalosse, Tursan, and Astarac, E. by Bigorre, and S. by the Pyrenees. Its name can be traced back to the town of Beneharnum, which first appears in the Antonine Itinerary. The population is mainly of Basque origin, with possibly a certain mixture of Greek blood from the ancient colonies of that people. The Basque language, in spite of the diffusion of French, is still maintained in the district; and it is asserted that traces of old Hellenic names are not infrequent. Béarn begins first to take rank as a separate viscounty under Louis the Pious. From its first viscounts, who were descended from the dukeβ of Gascony, it passed about 1134, by failure of the male line, to the Catalonian family of Moncado; and after the people, who were hostile to all connection with Spain, had several times chosen their own leaders, it passed to the family of Foix, from whom it was transmitted through the houses of Grailly and D’Albret to the Bourbons, who, in the person of Henry, IV., made it an apanage of the crown of France. It was not till 1620, however, that it was formally incorporated; and even till 1790 it continued to be governed by its own constitution or system of Fors, which only exists in the form in which it was drawn up in 1288, though mention is made of it as early as 1080. The parliament of Béarn consisted of two sections, the first composed of the clergy and the nobles, and the second of mayors and councillors (or jurats') from forty-two towns or communities. It met every year, and was always presided over by the bishop of Lescar. A body of commissioners, called the abrège des états, or epitome of parliament, 'was selected from the .members— twelve fron the nobles and twelve from the third estate— for the purpose of deciding any business that might demand attention during the time between the regular sessions. The administration of justice devolved in the last resort on a cour majour, or greater court, which was changed by Henry d’Albret into a sovereign council under the presidency of the chancellor of Navarre and Béarn, and afterwards, by] Louis XIII., into a parlement of the ordinary type. Histories of Béarn have been written by Belloy (1608), Marca (1640), D’Olhagaray (1609), Faget de Baure (1818), Mazure (1839).
