BODMIN, a parliamentary and municipal borough and market-town of England, in the county of Cornwall, 235 miles from London, and 30 from Plymouth by rail. It is situated between two hills, and consists of one narrow but well-paved street, about a mile in length. The church of St Petrock, which formerly belonged to the monastery of that name, is a spacious building dating from 1472; and the town-hall consists partly of remains of the convent of the Grey Friars. A lunatic asylum, erected in 1866, the [9:3:849] couuty jail, rebuilt in 1859, and a market-house of recent date, are among the chief buildings. The principal manufacture is shoes. Four annual fairs for cattle and horses are held in the town, and at St Lawrence, one mile to the S.W., there is a fair in October for cattle and sheep. Bodmin returned two members to Parliament from the time of Edward I. till 1868, when its representation was reduced to one member. The assizes and quarter-sessions are held in the town, and it is one of the polling-places for the east division of the county. Bodmin or, as the name appears in charters, Bosmana or Bod-minian, grew up in the neighbourhood of a monastic building, which is said to have been founded as early as 926. At the time of the Conquest it was a flourishing town, but fell into decay at the Reformation, and only recovered its prosperity in the course of last century. In 1498 the Cornish insurrection was originated by the people of Bodmin, who again, in the reign of Edward VI., expressed their discontent at the change of religion by resorting to arms. Population of municipal borough in 1871, 4672, and of parliamentary borough, 6758.
