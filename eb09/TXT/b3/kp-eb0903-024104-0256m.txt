BAILEN, a town of Spain, in the province of Jaen, 24 miles N.N.W. of Jaen. It seems to correspond to the ancient Baecula, where Scipio gained signal victories over Hasdrubal, 209 b.c., and over Mago and Masinissa, 206 b.c. (Polyb., X. 38, xi. 20; Liv., xxvii. 18-20, xxviii. 13). In the neighbourhood also, in 1212, was fought the great battle of Navas de Tolosa, where Alphonso VIII. is said to have left 200,000 Moors dead on the field, with the loss of only 25 Christians. Here again, on the 23d of July 1808, the French general Dupont, after a bloody contest of several days, signed the capitulation of Bailen, by which 17,000 men were delivered up to the Spaniards as prisoners of war. This disaster was the first great blow to the French arms in the Peninsula. There is nothing remarkable about the town, except the ruins of a castle, formerly belonging to the counts of Benavente, and now the property of the Osuna family. Glass and tiles are manufactured, and the weaving of cloth and pressing of olives are carried on. Population, 7831. (Madoz, Diccionario; Ukert, vol. x. p. 379.)
