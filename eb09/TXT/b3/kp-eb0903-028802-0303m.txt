BALLINA, a seaport and market-town of Ireland, county of Mayo, 18 miles N.N.E. of Castlebar, situated on the River Moy, which is here crossed by two bridges. It has a parish and a Roman Catholic church (the latter being in the suburb of Ardnaree on the opposite side of the river), Baptist and Methodist chapels, a court-house, three branch banks, a workhouse, hospital, dispensary, barracks, and several schools. A convent was erected in 1867. The salmon fishery and fish-curing are important branches of its trade; and it has also breweries and tiour-mills, and manufactures snuff and coarse linen. The amount of harbour receipts in 1873 was £1266. In 1798 Ba∏ina was for ä short time in the possession of the French, under General Humbert. In the neighbourhood there is an interesting dolmen, proved by the early annals of Ireland to belong to the 5th century a.d. (vide Fergusson’s Rude Stone Monuments'). To the east of the village are the remains of an abbey, with a Gothic door-case in fine preservation (Archdall). Population in 1871, 5551.
