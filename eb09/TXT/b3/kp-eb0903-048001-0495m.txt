BEDDOES, Thomas Lovell, a modern English dramatist of peculiar and almost unique genius, was the son of the preceding, and was born at Clifton, 20th July 1803. He received his education at the Charter House, and subsequently at Pembroke College, Oxford, at both of which places he displayed a rugged independence of character, combined with eccentricity of demeanour and an aversion to the ordinary course of study. While still an undergraduate, he published his Bridés Tragedy, a piece less characterized by originality than his subsequent performances, and altogether in the taste of the Elizabethan revival of the day initiated by the publication of Lamb’s Specimens. The notice it obtained from Barry Cornwall and other representatives of this school, encouraged him to devote himself altogether to the cultivation of dramatic poetry; and he speedily produced a number of superb fragments, ranging down from the ambitious but unfinished sketches for tragedies to be entitled Torrismond and The Second Brother, to short descriptive passages of a few lines each, unsurpassed for originality of conception and condensed force. His genius, unfortunately, though highly poetical, was in no respect dramatic; he entirely lacked the power of constructing a plot and deducing character from action; and his endeavours to achieve a complete work proved abortive until 1829, when the strangely fascinating but fantastic and incoherent drama of Death's Jest-Book, or The Fool's Tragedy, was laboriously put together from a series of abortive attempts. By this time Beddoes had become a resident in Germany, and a zealous student of physiology, which, by affording another outlet for that intense curiosity respecting the mysteries of life and death which had hitherto been the mainspring of his poetical efforts, greatly contributed to repress the external manifestations of his genius. Dissatisfaction with his tragedy, which he never cared to publish during his lifetime, and the gradual disuse of his native language, conspired to reduce him to silence. He led for several years an unsettled life on the Continent, devoted to anatomical research, and actively participating in liberal and democratic movements in Germany and Switzerland, until his death in 1849 from the effects of an accident. His literary remains were published in 1851 by his friend Mr Kelsall, with a most interesting memoir, and copious selections from his graphic and striking correspondence, which is distinguished by all the characteristics of his verse. Beddoes is a poet for poets, and few other readers will enjoy him. He is “of imagination all compact;” his works scarcely contain a single passage of purely subjective feeling. He is, perhaps, the most concrete poet of his day; the most disposed to express sentiment by imagery and material symbolism. In this he resembles Keats, and may be termed a Gothic Keats, the Teutonic counterpart of his more celebrated contemporary’s Hellenism. The spirit of Gothic architecture seems to live in his verse, its grandeur and grotesqueness, its mystery and its gloom. His relation to the Elizabethan dramatists, moreover, is nearly the same as that of Keats to the Elizabethan pastoral poets; but the resemblance is one of innate temperament: he borrowed nothing, either from his Elizabethan precursors or the chief objects of his admiration among his contemporaries, Keats and Shelley. The want of constructive power which mars his dramas is even more prejudicial to his lyrics; but some few songs, where the right key-note has been struck from the first, rank among the most perfect in our language. The leading features of Beddoes’s personal character were uncompromising independence, sterling integrity, and a thorough disdain for the opinion of the world. His life was entirely devoted to ideal aims, and his tastes were of the most simple and philosophic character. The asperity of his demeanour repelled strangers, but he was highly valued by the few whose intimacy he condescended to encourage.
