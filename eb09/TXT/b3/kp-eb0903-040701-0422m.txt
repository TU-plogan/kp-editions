BASEDOW, Johann Bernhard, a German author, born at Hamburg 11th September 1723, was the son of a hairdresser. He was educated at the Johanneum in that town, where he came under the influence of the well-known rationalist, H. S. Reimarus, author of the Wolfenbüttel Fragments. In 174-1 he went to Leipsic to study theology, and gave himself up entirely to the instructions of Professor Crusius, and to the study of philosophy. This at first induced sceptical notions; a more profound examination of the sacred writings, and of all that relates to them, brought him back to the Christian faith, but, in his retirement, he formed his belief after his own ideas, and it was far from orthodox. He returned to Hamburg, where in 1749, Μ. de Quaalen, privy-councillor of Holstein, appointed him preceptor to his son. Basedow now began to exhibit his really remarkable powers as an educator of the young, and acquired so much distinction that, in 1753, he was chosen professor of moral philosophy and belles-lettres in the academy of Soroë in Denmark. On account of his theological opinions he w as removed from this post and transferred to Altona, where some of his published works brought him into great disfavour. He left off giving lessons without losing his salary; and, towards the end of 17G7, he abandoned theology to devote himself with the same ardour to education, of which he conceived the project of a general reform in Germany. He began by publishing An Address to the Friends of Humanity, and to Persons in Power, on Schools, on Education, and its Influence on Public Happiness, with the Plan of an Elementary Treatise on Human Knowledge, Hamburg, 1768. He proposed the reform of schools and of the common methods of instruction, and the establishment of an institute for [9:3:408] qualifying teachers,—soliciting subscriptions for the printing of his elementary work, where his principles were to be explained at length, and illustrated by plates. The subscriptions for this object amounted to 15,000 thalers (£2250), and in 1774 he published his Elementary Work, a complete system of primary education, intended to develop the intelligence of the pupils and to bring them, so far as possible, into contact with realities, not with mere words. The work was received with great favour, and Basedow obtained means to establish an institute for education at Dessau, and to apply his principles in training disciples, who might spread them over all Germany. Little calculated by nature or habit to succeed in an employment which requires the greatest regularity, patience, and attention, he, however, engaged in this new project with all his accustomed ardour. The name of Philanthropin appeared to him the most expressive of his views; and he published at Leipsic in 1774 a pamphlet entitled The Philanthropinon founded at Dessaιι, containing the details of his plan. He immediately set about carrying it into execution; but he had few scholars, and the success by no means answered his hopes. Nevertheless, so well had his ideas been received that similar institutions sprang up all over the land, and the most prominent writers and thinkers openly advocated the plan. Had Basedow been a man of ordinary tact, his success would have been complete. But his temper was intractable, and his management was one long quarrel with his colleagues. The institution was finally shut up in 1793. Basedow died at Magdeburg on the 25th July 1790. Notices of his life and works have been published by Rathmann (1791) and Meyer (1791-2).
