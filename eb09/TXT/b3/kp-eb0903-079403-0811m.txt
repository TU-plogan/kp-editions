BITTERS, an aromatized alcoholic beverage, so named originally in the United States, where it was first used on account of its flavour and tonic influence. The drink by itself, or as an addition to unflavoured spirits, is used with considerable frequency in Europe, and especially in France it has come to be be favourably regarded as a substitute for the insidious and deleterious absinthe.

The preparation of bitters in Europe was at first a spécialité of the Dutch, and Dutch bitters are the staple used in Great Britain.
