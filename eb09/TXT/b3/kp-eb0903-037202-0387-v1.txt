BARELÎ, or Bareilly, a district of British India in the Rohilkhand division, under the jurisdiction of the Lt.-Governor of the North-Western Provinces, situated between 28° 2' and 29° 2' N. lat., and 79° 2' 30" and 80° 13' 15" E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Kumâon district and the independent state of Nepâl; on the E. by a portion of the district of Shâhjahânpur, and the district of Lakhimpur in Oudh; on the S. by the districts of Budâon and Shâhjahânpur; and on the W. by the native state of Râmpur and Budâon. Bareli is a level country, watered by many streams, the general slope being towards the south. The soil is fertile and highly cultivated, groves of noble trees abound, and the villages have a neat, prosperous look. A tract of forest jungle, called the Tardi, stretches along the extreme north of the district, and teems with large game, such as tigers, bears, deer, wild pigs, Ac.

The River Sarda or Ghagrâ forms the eastern boundary of the district, and is the principal stream. Next in importance is the Râmgangâ, which receives as its tributaries most of the hill torrents of the Kumâon mountains; the principal ones being the East Balιgιil, Nakatiyâ, Deuraniyâ, Saukhâ, Sidhâ, Dujaura, Kichaha, West Bahgûl, Bhakrâ, Dhakrâ, and Dliùrâ. The Deohâ is another great drainage artery, and receives many minor streams. The Gomati or Gumti also passes through the district. Bareli district has an area of 2976'70 square miles, of which 1845'28 square miles are under cultivation; 727'65 square miles are cultivable, but not actually under cultivation; 25'16 square miles are held revenue free; and 378'60 square miles are returned as uncultivable waste.

The census of 1872 takes the area at 2982 square miles, and returns the population at 1,507,139 souls, inhabiting 3548 villages or townships, and 296,441 houses; density of population per square mile, 505; villages or townships per square mile, 1 '2; persons per village or township, 425; houses per square mile, 99; persons per house, 5. Of the total population, 1,197,583, or 79'5 per cent., are Hindus; 308,682, or 20'5 per cent., Mahometans; and 536 Christians, or others of unspecified religion. The Mahometans are chiefly the descendants of Yusafzai Afghâns, called the Rohillâ Pathâns, who settled in the country about the year 1720. The Rohillâswere formerly the ruling race of the tract of country called Rohilkhand, and are men of a taller stature, a fairer complexion, and a more arrogant air than the general inhabitants of the district. Bishop Heber has described them as follows:— “The country is burdened with a crowd of lazy, profligate, self-called sawârs (cavaliers), who, though many of them are not worth a rupee, conceive it derogatory to their gentility and Pathân blood to apply themselves to any honest industry, and obtain for the most part a precarious livelihood by sponging on Hie industrious tradesmen and farmers[9:3:373], on whom they levy a sort of blackmail, or as hangers on to the few wealthy and noble families yet remaining in the province. These men have no visible means of maintenance, and no visible occupation except that of lounging up and down with their swords and shields, like the ancient Highlanders, whom in many respects they much resemble.” The Rohillâs, after fifty years’ precarious independence, were subjugated in 1774 by the confederacy of British troops with the Nawâb of Oudh’s army, which formed so serious a charge against Warren Hastings. Their territory was in that year annexed to Oudh. In 1801 the Nawâb of Oudh ceded it to the Company in commutation of the subsidy money. During the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857 the Rohillâs took a very active part against the English, but since then they have been disarmed. Both before and after that year, however, the Bareli Mahometans have distinguished themselves by fanatical tumults against the Hindus.

The inhabitants of the district are for the most part poor, but their condition has improved under English rule. Sugar and rice, of which large quantities are exported, form the principal agricultural products of the district Pilibhit formed an independent district till its incorporation with Bareli in 1842; its rice is celebrated all over the N.W. Provinces. Other agricultural products—wheat, barley, cotton, tobacco, maize, millet, pulses, and fruit. The jungle tract of the district produces fine timber, in which a large trade is carried on. The total revenue of the district for 1870-71 amounted to £246,419, and the civil expenditure to £80,978. By far the greater part of the revenue is derived from the land; the new settlement for thirty years was concluded in 1872. Four towns contain a population of upwards of 5000 souls :—1. Bareli—area, 1280 acres, noticed below. 2. Pilibhit—area, 433 acres; population, 29,840; municipal revenue (1872), £3291, 6s.; expenditure, £2698, 2s.; rate of taxation, 2s. 2⅛d. per head. 3. Bisâlpur—area, 142 acres; population, 9250; municipal revenue, £282, 8s.; expenditure, £343, 18s.; rate of taxation, 7gd. per head. 4. Anwlah—area, 128 acres; population, 11,153; municipal revenue, £183, 2s. 5⅜d.; expenditure, £224, 15s. 10d.; rate of taxation, 4d. per head. Other minor towns: Faridpur, population, 4940; Sarauli, 4585; Nawâbganj, 4418. There are 19 other towns with a population of above 2000. Bareli shows a heavy criminal return, and the police do not appear to be successful in grappling with crime. The regular police consists of a force of 4218 men. In 1872 there were 518 schools in the district, attended by 9265 pupils, besides those attending the university college in the town of Bareli.

Barelî ∖ Bareilly ∖ , the principal place in the district of the same name, situated on the left bank of the Juâ, a tributary of the Western Râmgangâ,in N. lat. 28° 23', E. long. 79° 28'. It is a large town, with a brisk and lucrative commerce, and manufactures consisting principally of house furnitures, such as chairs, tables, &c. Mr Thornton says, that “besides the hands engaged in this branch of handicraft, there are cotton weavers, dressers, and twisters, manufacturers of muslins, and also of silks and brocades, dyers and colour-makers, linen and cloth-plaiters, gold and silver lace-makers, jewellers, goldsmiths, and silversmiths, blacksmiths, coppersmiths, and tinmen, cutlers, armourers, sealmakers and engravers, turners, saddlers, tailors, <fcc., &c.” In 1872 Bareli town contained a population of 102,982, of whom 59,036 were Hindus, 43,463 Mahometans, and 483 of unspecified religion. In 1872 the municipal revenue of the town amounted to £6602, 8s.; expenditure, £7217, 12s.; rate of municipal taxation, Is. 3fd per head of the population. The municipal revenue is derived from octroi duties levied on articles of food brought for sale into the town. The principal institution in the town is the Bareli college, intended as a seat of upper class learning for the surrounding districts of the N.W. Provinces. It is conducted by a staff of efficient professors from England, and its course includes the subjects for degrees in the Calcutta University. In 1872-73 it was attended by 310 pupils. The cost of the college department and upper school amounted to £5836, of which Government contributed £5335.
