BAINES, Edward, for many years, proprietor and editor of the Leeds Mercury, and M.P. for Leeds from 1834 to 1841, was born in 1774 at Walton-le-Dale, a village distant a little way from Preston, in Lancashire. He was educated at the grammar schools of Hawkshead and Preston, and at the age of sixteen was apprenticed to a printer in the latter town. After remaining there four years and a half he removed to Leeds, finished his apprenticeship, and at once started in business for himself. He was always a most assiduous student, and quickly became known as a man of great practical shrewdness and ability, who took a keen interest in political and social movements. His liberal opinions in politics led him to sympathise with the dissenting party in church affairs, and it was not long before he joined the body of Independents. In 1801 the assistance of friends among the members of that party enabled him to purchase the copyright of the Leeds Mercury. Provincial newspapers did not at that time possess much influence; the editorial province was not extended to the composition of what are now called leading articles, and the system of reporting was defective. In both respects Baines made a complete change in the Mercury. The ability of his political articles gradually caused the paper to be looked upon as the organ of Liberal opinion in Leeds, and it contributed not a little to the spread of sound doctrines on practical questions in the north of England. At the same time his watchful care secured the efficiency of the minor departments. Baines soon began to take a more prominent part in politics; he was an ardent advocate of parliamentary reform, and it was mainly by his influence that Macaulay was returned for Leeds in 1832. In 1834, when a vacancy was caused by Macaulay’s acceptance of an Indian appointment, Baines was proposed as a candidate, and was returned after a sharp contest. He was re-elected in 1835 and 1837, but was obliged to resign from ill health in 1841. He was noted in Parliament as a judicious supporter of the Liberal party, but with independent views. He strongly advocated the separation of church and state, and opposed Government interference in national education. His letters to Lord John Russell on the latter question (1846) had a powerful influence in determining the action of the Government. He died in 1848. In the midst of his active life he had found time for literary work. His best known writings are:— The History, Directory, and Gazetteer of the County of York; History, Directory, and Gazetteer of the County of Lancaster; History of the County Palatine and Duchy of Lancaster. He was also the author of a History of the Wars of Napoleon, which was continued under the title of A History of the Reign of George III. His Life (1861) has been written by his son, Edward Baines, jun., for some time editor, and still (1875) one of the proprietors, of the Leeds Mercury, and well known by his histories of the cotton and woollen manufactures of Great Britain.
