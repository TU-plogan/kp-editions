BIR, or Birejik (the former being its Arabic and the latter its Turkish name), a town of Asiatic Turkey, in the pashalik of Rakka, built on the side of a chalky range of hills that skirts the left bank of the Euphrates, about 90 miles N.E. of Aleppo, in long. 38° 6' E., and lat. 36° 48' N. It consists of about 2000 houses, surrounded by a dilapidated wall and protected by the citadel of Kalai-Beda, which, with its earthquake-shattered interior, occupies a precipitous eminence cut off from the town. Bir is situated on the main route from Aleppo to Orfa, Diarbekr, and the Persian frontier, and had formerly a considerable trade with Baghdad by means of the river. It is now a post and telegraph station. A ferry seems to have crossed the river at this spot from time immemorial, Abraham himself having made use of it, according to tradition, on his passage from Haran to Canaan. The town is identified with the ancient Birtha or Britha, where the emperor Julian rested on his march to Maogamalcha, and found quarters for his army in one extensive palace. In the English Euphrates expedition Bir was frequently visited, Fort William, one of the principal places of rendezvous, being about 2 miles further down on the other side of the river. (See view in Chesney’s Narrative of Euphrates Expedition, 1868.)
