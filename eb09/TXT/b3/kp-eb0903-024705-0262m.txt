BÂKARGANJ, a district of British India in the Dacca division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, situated between 23° 14' 27" and 21° 48' N. lat., and 89° 55' 10" and 91° 4' 50" E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the districts of Dacca and Faridpur, from which it is separated by the Padmâ and Mainâkâtikhâl; on the E. by the Meghnâ and Shâhbâzpur rivers, and by the Bay of Bengal, which separates it from Noâkhâlf and Tipperah; on the S. by the Bay of Bengal; and on the W. by J esssr and Faridpur districts. Area, 4935 square miles; population, 2,377,433. The general aspect of the district is that of a flat even country, dotted with clusters of bamboos and betel-nut trees, and intersected by a perfect network of dark-coloured and sluggish streams. There is not a hill or hillock in the whole district, but it derives a certain picturesque beauty from its wide expanses of cultivation, and the greenness and freshness of the vegetation. This is especially conspicuous in the rains, but at no time of the year does the district present a dried or burnt-up appearance. The villages, which are always walled round by groves of bamboos and betel-nut palms, have often a very striking appearance; and Bâkarganj has many beauties of detail which strike a traveller in passing through the country. The level of the country is low, forming as it does a part of the great Gangetic delta; and the rivers, streams, and water-courses are so numerous that it is very difficult to travel except by boat at any season of the year. Every natural hollow is full of water, around the margin of which long grasses, reeds, and other aquatic plants grow in the greatest profusion, often making it difficult to say where the land ends and where the water begins. Towards the north-west the country is very marshy, and nothing is to be seen for miles but tracts of unreclaimed swamps and rice lands, with a few huts scattered here and there, and raised on mounds of earth. In the south of the district, along the sea face of the Bay of Bengal, lie the forest tracts of the Sundarbans, the habitation of tigers, leopards, and other wild beasts.

The principal rivers of the district are the Meghnâ, the Arial Khan, and the Haringhâtâ or Baleswar, with their numerous offshoots. The Meghna represents the accumulated waters of the Brahmaputra and Ganges. It flows along the eastern boundary of the district in a southerly direction for about 100 miles, till it debouches into the Bay of Bengal. During the latter part of its course this noble river expands into a large estuary containing many islands, the principal of which is that of Dakshin Shâhbâzpur. The Arial Khan, a branch of the Ganges, enters the district from the north, and flows generally in a south-easterly direction till it falls into the estuary of the Meghnâ. The main channel of the Arial Khan is about 1700 yards in width in the dry season, and from 2000 to 3000 yards in the rains. It receives a number of tributaries, sends off several offshoots, and is navigable throughout the year by native cargo boats of the largest size. The Haringhâtâ, Baleswar, Madhumati, and Garai, are various local names for the same river in different parts of its course, and represent another great offshoot of the Ganges. It enters Bâkarganj near the north-west corner of the district, whence it forms its western boundary, and runs south, but with great windings in its upper reaches, till it crosses the Sundarbans, and finally falls into the Bay of Bengal by a large and deep estuary, capable of receiving merchant ships of considerable burden. In the whole of its course through the district the river is navigable by native boats of large tonnage, and by large sea-going ships as high up as Morrellganj, in tbe neighbouring district of Jessor. Among its many tributaries in Bâkarganj the most important is the Kacha, itself a considerable stream and navigable by large boats all the year round, which flows in a southerly direction for 20 miles, when it falls into the Baleswar. Other rivers of minor importance are the Barisâl, Bishkhâli, Nihâlganj, Khairâbâd, Ghâgar, Kumâr, &c. * All the rivers in the district are subject to tidal action from the Meghnâ on the north, and from the Bay of Bengal on the south, and nearly all of them are navigable at high tide by country boats of all sizes. The rise of the tide is very considerable in the estuary of the Meghna, and many ofthe creeks and water-courses in the island of Dakshin Shâhbâzpur, which are almost dry at ebb tide, contain 18 or 19 feet of water at the flood. A very strong “bore” or tidal wave runs up the estuary of the Meghnâ at spring tides, and a singular sound like thunder, known as the “Barisal Guns,” is often heard far out at sea about the time it is coming in. There are numerous marshes in the district, of great size and depth, and abounding in fish. The following peculiarity of some of them is quoted from Colonel GastrelΓs Geographical and Statistical Report of the District (1868):—“In some of the swamps, especially in those of Bakarganj, the surface growth of aquatic plants, mixed with drift weeds, [9:3:248] grasses, and rice stalks, increases annually, and in process of time a crust is formed capable of supporting human beings, and on which rice is cultivated. Small floating patches are thus formed, and the natives assert that in very strong blowing weather these are sometimes carried from one side of the swamp to the other, and are a cause of great dispute. A Government official, whose duties often took him to these swamps, mentioned that the first time he found himself on ground of this kind, being totally unaware of its nature, he was greatly alarmed at feeling, as he thought, the earth moving beneath him; and still more astonished when, on seeking information from the inhabitants, he was told ‘it was only the tide coming in.’ The owners of these floating fields make holes through them, and catch the fish which are immediately attracted by the light.”

The census of 1872 disclosed a population of 2,377,433 souls in Bákarganj district, spread over 4935 square miles, inhabiting 4269 villages and 321,657 houses; persons per square mile, 482; per village, 557; per house, 7 - 4. The Mahometans are the largest section of the population, and number 1,540,965, or 64 - 8 per cent, of the total inhabitants; Hindus, 827,393, or 34 ’ 8 per cent.; Buddhist, 4049, or ’ 2 per cent.; Christians, 4852, or '2 per cent.; and persons of unspecified religion, 174 souls. The Musalmáns of Bákarganj are among the worst of their creed, steeped in ignorance and prejudice, easily excited to violence and murder, veιy litigious, and grossly immoral. The Faráizís or Puritan sect of Mahometans are exceedingly numerous in the district. The Buddhist population consists of Maghs or the people of Arákán, who first settled in Bákarganj about seventy years ago, and have made themselves very useful in the clearing of the Sundarbans. A gipsy-like tribe called the Bebájiás are rather numerous in this district. They principally live in boats, travelling from place to place, profess Muhammadanism, and gain their subsistence by wood-cutting in the Sundarbans, fishing, iortune-telling, and trading in trinkets. The Christian community of Bákarganj owes its origin to the Roman Catholic monastery at Bandel near Calcutta, and to the Protestant (Baptist) missionaries at Serampur. The principal native converts come from the Hindu low-caste Chandáls, &c., who subsist by cultivation.

Barisál, the headquarters station, sitüated on the west bank of the Barisál river, in 21° 41' 40'' N. lat., and 90° 24' 30" E. long., is the only town containing upwards of 5000 inhabitants. In 1872 its population amounted to 7684 souls; municipal income, £1019, 18s.; municipal expenditure, £1006, 2s.; incidence of taxation, 2s. 7|d. per head. There are also three other municipal towns— (1.) Nalchití, a large trading village; principal exports, rice and paddy; imports, salt, tobacco, oil, and sugar; (2.) Jhálakátí or Mahárájganj, a large timber market, also trading in rice, paddy, and salt; (3.) Daulat Khán, the principal village in the island of Dakshín, Sháhbázpur; exports, betel-nut. A number of small trading villages exist throughout the district, and each locality has its periodical fairs for purposes of traffic. The material condition of the people is good. Every inhabitant is a small landholder, and cultivates sufficient rice and other necessaries for the support of his family. Owing to this reason, hired labour is very scarce, and during the harvest season, when the few available labourers are sought for by the landholders, the price of labour rises to Is. per diem. The average cost of living to a labouring man is about 6s. per month. Except in the larger villages, the dwellings of the people are very isolated. The inhabitants seldom congregate together into hamlets, but each man builds his homestead on the highest spot on his own land without any reference to his neighbours. Rice is the great crop of the district, and three harvests are obtained annually—the áman, or winter rice; áus, or autumn crop; and boro, or spring rice. The former yields the finest grain, and is the staple crop of the district. It is sown at the setting in of the rains in April or May, transplanted from the beginning of June to the middle of August, and reaped in November or December. About 100 varieties of the áman rice are cultivated in the district. The áus crop is sown in the early part of the hot weather, and reaped in August. Upwards of 20 varieties of this rice are produced. The boro or spring rice is of a coarse description, largely used by the poorer classes, and is cultivated to a considerable extent in the alluvial river accretions, and on other low-lying grounds. It is sown broadcast in December, and reaped in April or May. Bákarganj exports its rice chiefly to Calcutta. The average yield of rice land here is from 17½ to 22 cwt. per acre. Other crops— khesári (Lathyrus sativus), rnusuri (fjicer lens), sarishd or mustard, rape-seed, linseed, jute, sugar-cane, betel-nut, <fcc. Manufactures—pottery, coarse cloth, oil, fine mats, and molasses. The district has only five small roads, but its rivers afford ample means of communication.

Like all other districts of Bengal, Bákarganj has steadily increased in prosperity since its administration passed into the hands of English officers, and especially of late years, since the country has been directly under the Crown. From the time of the acquisition of Bengal by the British in 1765 up the end of 1817, Bákarganj formed a part of the Dacca district. It was then formed into a separate collectorship, with the object of encouraging enterprising persons to cultivate its immense tracts of waste lands. In 1818 the net revenue of the district amounted to £96,438, and the net civil expenditure to £13,647. Two years later (1820) the net district revenue had slightly decreased to £95,709, while the net expenditure on civil administration had increased to £16,659. During the next forty years both revenue and expenditure rapidly increased, and in 1860-61 the net revenue of the district amounted to £150,305, and the net civil expenditure to £32,584. In 1870-71 the total net revenue was £203,445, and net civil expenditure, £44,902. The land revenue of Bákarganj is settled in perpetuity with the zαrnvηdars. In 1872 the district contained 4729 estates, held by 5960 proprietors, who were assessed at a total revenue of £143,156. In 1871 the machinery for protecting the district consisted of 583 men of the regular police of all ranks, maintained at a total cost of £11,186. Attached to the regular police is a river patrol consisting of five boats, and manned by a crew of 35 men. The village watch or rural police consisted in 1871 of 5135 men, maintained at a cost of £18,486, paid by the landholders and villagers, each village watchman having besides a small plot of ground rent free. A municipal police of 53 men was also maintained in the towns and large villages, at a total cost of £403, 14s., defrayed out of municipal receipts. Education is in a very backward state in Bákarganj, owing to the inhabitants being almost wholly composed of petty husbandmen, the majority of whom are Mahometans of the most bigoted tenets. In 1856-57 the district contained 5 schools, attended by 482 pupils, and maintained at a total cost of £595, 13s. In 1871-72 there were 78 Government and aided schools, attended by 3713 pupils, and maintained at a total cost of £3767, 12s., the total cost to the state being £1232, 10s. This is exclusive of private schools uninspected by the education department. The census report of 1872 returned the total number of schools (Government and private) at 512, attended by a total of 7299 pupils. Barisál town contains a Government school, which is the largest in Eastern Bengal, and financially the most successful; the cost to Government for its 355 pupils in 1872 being only £31, 12s. Bákarganj district is divided into 5 magisterial sub-divisions, viz., Barisál, Dakshín Sháhbázpur, Mádá-rípur, Pirozpur, ∙and Patuákhálí, comprising 18 police circles or thdnás, and 54 fiscal divisions or parganás. The climate of Bákarganj is one of the healthiest in Eastern Bengal, owing to the strong south-west monsoon, which comes up directly from the Bay of Bengal, and keeps the atmosphere cool; but the heavy rain-fall and consequent humidity of the atmosphere, combined with the use of bad water, are fruitful sources of disease. The average annual temperature varies from 78° to 85°. The thermometer ranges from 62° to 98°. The endemic diseases of Bákarganj[9:3:249] are fevers of the intermittent, remittent, and continued types, attributable to the extreme dampness and malarious nature of the district. Cholera is always present, the number of cases increasing in the hot season and the beginning of the cold weather. Smallpox occasionally makes its appearance in an epidemic form,—frequently caused by inoculation, which is carried on to a great extent in Bâkarganj by the native medical practitioners.
