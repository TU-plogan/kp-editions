BANFF, the county town of Banffshire, is a place of great antiquity; according to tradition, it was at times the residence of Malcolm Canmore. It was visited by David I. and his son Henry; and there is a charter of Malcolm IV., signed at Banff the eleventh year of his reign, which corresponds with 1163. The church was given to the monastery of Arbroath by William the Lion, and a convent of Carmelite or White Friars is mentioned in a charter by Robert I., 1324. The town is said to have lost many of its ancient grants, but these, it is added, were renewed in 1324 by King Robert the Bruce, and in 1372 by Robert II. The natural situation of the town is beautiful, having its south-eastern exposure on a gentle slope, the wide blue sea on its N., the River Deveron on the E., and on the S. the richly-wooded country with the magnificent mansion and grounds of the earl of Fife. The streets are well and regularly built and paved, and are remarkable for their cleanliness. The principal buildings are Banff Castle, a plain modern building, belonging to the earl of Seafield, erected upon the site of an old castle, in which Archbishop Sharp was born; the county court buildings; the town-house, surmounted by a spire 100 feet high; a prison; parish church, Episcopal church and parsonage, Free church, United Presbyterian, Independent, Methodist, and Roman Catholic places of worship; Chalmers’ Hospital; a mason lodge, of tasteful architecture; the academy, a modem edifice of Grecian design, capable of containing 600 scholars, to which there is attached an extensive museum. There are large and well-conducted seminaries for young ladies, also several libraries, a club-room, branch banks and a savings-bank, public baths hotels, custom-house, gas and water works, <fcc. The Banffshire Journal, a weekly newspaper, with an extensive circulation, is published on Tuesdays. At one period Banff carried on a considerable manufactory of stockings and linen yarn. A branch of the Great North of Scotland Railway, which leaves Inveramsay Junction and terminates at Macduff, is the direct communication from Aberdeen, and has a station at Bridge of Banff. Another line of railway, which has its terminu3 at the harbour of Banff, runs in connection with Portsoy, and joins the Great North of Scotland Railway at Grange, near Keith. The principal exports are grain, cattle, salmon, herrings, haddocks, pork, butter, and potatoes. The river fishing is the property of the earl of Fife, with a sea-line extending a considerable distance on each side of the river mouth. The burgh is under the jurisdiction of à provost, three bailies, and five councillors, who manage all the town’s affairs. Mr Alexander Cassie of London, a native of Banff, some thirty years ago, left to the poor of the town about £20,000, the interest of which is divided twice a year among the poor. A few years ago, Mr Alexander Chalmers of Clunie, a general merchant and shipowner in Banff, left about £70,000 to build and endow a hospital for sick and destitute. The building, which is near the harbour, has somewhat the appearance of Donaldson’s Hospital at Edinburgh.

The town of Macduff, which is fast rising into importance, has a good harbour, branch banks, &c. It is about a mile to the E. of Banff, with which it has communication by a stone bridge of seven arches across the Deveron. Its trade in shipping, <fcc., is more extensive than that of Banff, to which burgh it was united by the Reform Act. It was an old burgh of barony, called Doune, but soon after it was acquired by the Duff family its name was changed to Macduff. A harbour was then erected, and in 1783 it was made a burgh by George III. Macduff is locally situated within the parish of Gamrie, and has an independent municipal government. Banff and Macduff unite with Elgin, Cullen, Inverurie, Kintore, and Peterhead, in sending a member to parliament. Population within the parliamentary boundaries in 1871, about 4000; municipality, 3557. The weekly market-day of Banff is Friday, on which day a corn market is held; and there are two annual fairs.
