BEET. A considerable number of varieties of the genus Beta (Nat. Ord. Chenopodiaceoe) are cultivated for use on account of their large fleshy roots. The beets which are grown as root-plants, under the names of mangel-wurzel or mangold, field-beet, and garden beet, are generally supposed to be cultivated varieties of the sea-beet {B. maritima'). The cultivation of beet as a field crop is treated under Agriculture (vol. i. p. 381); and in relation to the production of sugar, for which purpose certain varieties of beet stand next in importance to the sugar cane, see Sugar. The garden-beet has been cultivated from very remote times as a salad plant, and for general use as a table vegetable. The variety most generally grown has long, tapering, carrot-shaped roots, the “flesh” of which is of a uniform deep red colour throughout, and the leaves brownish red. It is boiled and cut into slices for being eaten cold; and it is also prepared as a pickle, as well as in various other forms. Beet is in much more common use on the Continent as a culinary vegetable than in Great Britain, where it has, however, been cultivated for upwards of two centuries. The leaves of the white Sicilian beet and the Swiss chard beet, both varieties of Beta cicla, are used for salads and otherwise as culinary vegetables.
