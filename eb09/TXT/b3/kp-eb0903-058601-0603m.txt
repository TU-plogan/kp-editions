BERENICE, an ancient city on the western shore of the Red Sea, in 23° 56' N. lat. and 35° 34' E. long., near the head of the Sinus Immundus or Foul Bay. It was founded or enlarged by Ptolemy II., and grew into great importance as an entrepôt for the trade between Asia and Africa. Its harbour was sheltered on the north-east by an island that had topaz deposits, and in the neighbourhood were emerald mines. The ruins of a temple in the Egyptian style, but with Greek ornaments, are among the most important discovered on the site.
