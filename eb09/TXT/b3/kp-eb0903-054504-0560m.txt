BELLENDEN, »William, a distinguished classical scholar, who flourished during the early part of the 17th century, is said to have been a professor at the University of Paris. Nothing is known with certainty of his life, except that he held the office, probably a sinecure, of Master of Requests. The first of the works by which he is known was published in 1608, with the title Ciceronis Princeps, Rationes et Consilia bene gerendi firmandique Imperii, ex iis repetita quae ex Ciceronis defluxere fontibus in libros xvi. de Statu Rerum Romanarum, qui nondum lucem acceperunt. It is a laborious compilation of all Cicero’s remarks on the origin and principles of regal government, digested and systematically arranged. In 1612 there appeared a similar work, devoted to the consideration of consular authority and the Roman senate, Ciceronis Consul, Senator, Sena- tusque Romanus. His third work, De Statu Prisci Orbis, 1615, is a good outline of general history. All three works were combined in a single large volume, entitled De Statu Libri Tres, 1615, which was first brought into due notice by Dr Parr, who, in 1787, published an edition with a preface, famous for the elegance of its Latinity and the vehemence of its politics. The greatest of Bellenden’s works is the extensive treatise published posthumously in 1633, Gulielmi Bellendeni Scoti, Magistri supplicum Libellorum Augusti Regis Magnae Britanniae, de tribus Luminibus Romanorum libri sexdecim. The book is unfinished, and treats only of the first luminary, Cicero; the others intended were apparently Seneca and Pliny, probably the younger. It contains a most elaborate history of Rome and its institutions, drawn from Cicero, and thus forms a well-arranged storehouse of all the historical notices contained in that voluminous author. It has been suspected that Middleton was indebted for much of the information contained in his Life of Cicero to Bellenden’s little known work.
