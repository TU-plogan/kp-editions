BAKHMUT, a town of Russia in the government of Ekaterinoslav, near the river from which it derives its name. It owed its origin in the latter half of the 17th century to the discovery of salt-springs, which ceased, however, to be utilised in 1782. Its present importance is chiefly due to the extensive coal-deposits in the vicinity. Population, 16,791
