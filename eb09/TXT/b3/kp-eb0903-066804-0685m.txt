BIEZHETZ, a town of Russia, in the government of Tver, and 181 miles from that city, situated on the right bank of the Mologa, in 57° 46' N. lat. and 36° 43'E. long. On the left bank of the river lies the suburban village of Shtap, chiefly inhabited by the lower orders. Biezhetz is mentioned in the chronicles of 1137. On the fall of Novgorod, to which it had belonged, it was incorporated with the grand-duchy of Moscow; and in 1771 it was added to the government of Tver. Candles, leather, brandy, beer, flour, malt, oil, and bricks are all manufactured; but a more important branch of industry is the making of bags for grain and flour. There are two weekly markets and two annual fairs. Population in 1860, 5423.
