BARBAROSSA, meaning red-beard, the name of two celebrated Turkish corsairs of the 16th century. They were the sons of a Roumelian sipahi who had settled in Mitylene after the capture of that island by Mahomet IL, and who appears to have embraced Islamism. The elder of the two is generally called Aτuch, Horuk, or Ouradjh; the name of the younger was Khizr, but he was afterwards called by the sultan Khair-ed-deen, meaning “one good in the faith,” which was corrupted by the Christians into Hayraddin. The brothers early betook themselves to piracy; and after various successes and reverses, they acquired sufficient wealth and renown to enable them to fit out a small fleet with which they ravaged the shores of the Mediterranean, and became the pests of that sea. A richly laden vessel which they presented to the sultan at Constantinople procured for them honorary caftans and recognition of their services. About the year 1516, after having been for some time in the service of the bey of Tunis, they began to acquire considerable possessions on the coast of Africa. Hayraddin seized the island of Shershel, and Aruch gained a footing in Algiers. The latter began to extend his conquests into the district of Telmessan or Tlemcen, and was resisted by the Arabs, who summoned the Spaniards of Oran to their assistance. Aruch fell in battle in 1518, and w as succeeded at Algiers by Hayraddin, who, after the reigning prince, Selim, was removed (in what way is somewhat doubtful), consolidated his power by placing himself under the Sublime Porte. Solyman, who was delighted at obtaining so much territory at such a small cost, conferred upon Hayraddin the title of Begler-l>eg of Algiers. The power of the pirates rapidly increased; Algeciras, a small island opposite Algiers, was taken from the Spaniards after an obstinate resistance, and was united with the mainland by a mole. The coasts of the Mediterranean were completely at the mercy of Barbarossa, who carried off immense numbers of slaves. In 1533, when Solyman was about to make war upon his great rival, Charles V., Hayraddin joined him with a number of ships. He was received with great honour, and made admiral (caι>itan-pashd) of the fleet. His greatest exploit was the capture of Tunis, in which he obtained a footing by adopting the cause of a rival prince. As soon as he had deposed Muley Hassan, the reigning sovereign, he seized the town for himself and held it despite the resistance of the people. Charles V., however, sent out a great fleet, under Andrea Doria, who retook the town after a protracted siege. Barbarossa escaped to Algiers, collected his fleet, and again swept the seas. He plundered the coasts of Italy, captured Castelnuova, and inflicted a severe defeat on Doria. He died at Constantinople 4th July 1546. (See Von Hammer, Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches, iii. 164, seq.; also Blackwood's Magazine, vol. lii.) The Emperor Frederick I. is very frequently designated by the surname Barbarossa.
