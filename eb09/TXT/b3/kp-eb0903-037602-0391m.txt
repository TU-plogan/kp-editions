BARLEY(Hordeum), a most important genus of the cereal plants which belongs peculiarly to temperate regions. Four distinct species of barley, cultivated for the production of grain, are commonly enumerated,—1st, common or two-rowed barley, Hordeum distichum ; 2d, Bere or Bigg, II. vulgare ; 3d, six-rowed barley, II. hextastichum; and 4th, fan, spratt, or battledore barley, H. zeocriton. Of these species, but chiefly of the first two, very many varieties are recognized by cultivators, and new kinds are constantly being introduced. Barley is the most hardy of all cereal grains, its limit of cultivation extending further north than any other; and, at the same time, it can be profitably cultivated in sub-tropical countries. The opinion of Pliny, that it is the most ancient aliment of mankind, appears to be well founded, for no less than three varieties have been found in the lake dwellings of Switzerland, in deposits belonging to the Stone Period. According to Professor Heer these varieties are the common two-rowed (H. distichum), the large six-rowed (H. hextastichum densum), and the small six-rowed (II. hextastichum sanctum). The last variety is both the most ancient and the most commonly found, and is the sacred barley of antiquity, ears of which are frequently represented plaited in the hair of the goddess Ceres, besides being figured on ancient coins. The cultivation of barley in ancient Egypt is indicated in Exod. ix. 31. Till within recent times barley formed an important source of food in northern countries, and barley cakes are still to some extent eaten. Owing, however, to its poverty in that form of nitrogenous compound called gluten, so abundant in wheat, barley-flour cannot be baked into vesiculated bread; still it is a highly nutritious substance, the salts it contains having a high proportion of phosphoric acid, and on it the Greeks trained their athletes. The following is the composition of barleymeal according to Von Bibra, omitting the salts :—

Barley is now chiefly cultivated for malting, to prepare spirits and beer (see Brewing), but it is also largely employed in domestic cookery. For the latter purpose the hard, somewhat flinty grains are preferable, and they are prepared by grinding off the outer cuticle which forms “pot barley.” When the attrition is carried farther, so that the grain is reduced to small round pellets, it is termed “pearl barley.” Patent barley is either pot or pearl barley reduced to flour. Under the name decoctum hordei, a preparation[9:3:377] of barley is included in the British Pharmacopoeia, which is of value as a demulcent and emollient drink in febrile and inflammatory disorders. For the cultivation of barley, see Agriculture, vol. i. p. 358.

The following table shows the quantities and values of barley imported into the United Kingdom in 1873 :—·
