BADEN, Switzerland, a small town in the canton of Aargau, on the Limmat, 14 miles N.W. of Zurich. It is much frequented on account of its warm medicinal springs, which are about 20 in number, and vary in temperature from 98° to 126° Fahr. About 15,000 persons visit the place annually. Tacitus, in the first book of his Histories (c. 67), incidentally speaks of it as in modum, municipii extructus locus, amoeno salubrium aquarumusu frequens ; and numerous remains of pillars and inscriptions, coins, and other antiquities confirm his description. It was destroyed by the Alemanni and the Huns, but was again frequented during the reign of Charlemagne, though its modern prosperity only dates from the 15th century. For a long time the countship of Baden was in the hands of the Hapsburgs, but it was conquered by the Swiss Confederates in 1415. It was here that the famous disputation of Eck with Zwingle and Oecolampadius took place in 1526; and here was held the conference of 1589. In 1714 the peace which put an end to the war of the Spanish Succession was concluded at Baden between Austria and France; and four years afterwards a treaty between Zurich, Berne, and St Gall received its name from the town. Resident population, 3412.
