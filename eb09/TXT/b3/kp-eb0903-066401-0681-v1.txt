BIBULUS. Ths best-known of those who bore this surname, which belonged, to the Gens Calpurnia at Rome, was Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, elected consul with Julius Caesar, 59 B.c. He was the candidate put forward by the aristocratical party in opposition to L. Lucceius, who was of the party of Caesar; and bribery was freely used (with the approval, says Suetonius, of even the rigid Cato) to secure his election. But he proved no match for his able colleague. He made an attempt to oppose the agrarian law introduced by Caesar for distributing the lands of Campania, but was overpowered and even personally ill-treated by the violence of the mob. After making vain complaints in the senate, he shut himself up in his own house during the remaining eight months of his consulship, taking no part in public business beyond fulminating edicts against Caesar’s proceedings, which only provoked an attack upon his house by a mob of Caesar’s partizans. When the interests of Caesar and Pompey became divided, Bibulus supported the latter, and joined in proposing his election as sole consul (52 b.c.) Next year he went into Syria as proconsul, and claimed credit for a victory gained by one of his officers over the Parthians, who had invaded the province, but which took place before his own arrival in the country. After the expiration of his government there, Pompey gave him the command of his fleet in the Ionian Sea. Here also he proved himself utterly incapable; distinguishing himself chiefly by the cruel burning, with all their crews on board, of thirty transport vessels which had conveyed Cae3ar from Brundisium to the coast of Epirus, and which he had captured on their return, having failed to prevent their passage. He died soon afterwards of fatigue and mortification. By his wife Portia, daughter of Cato, afterwards married to Brutus, he had three sons. The two eldest were murdered in Egypt by some of the soldiery of Gabinius; the youngest, Lucius Calpurnius Bibulus, fought on the side of the republic at the battle of Philippi, but surrendered to Antony soon afterwards, and was by him appointed to the command of his fleet. He died while governor of Syria under Augustus.
