BAKEWELL, a market-town in Derbyshire, on the River Wye, 152 miles from London. Its fine old church contains monuments of the families of Vernon and Manners. The inhabitants are supported by the working of the coal, lead, and zinc mines, and the stone and marble quarries in the neighbourhood. There is also a large cotton manufactory in the town established by Arkwright. Bakewell is remarkable for a chalybeate spring, frequented by invalids. It has a free school of ancient date, a literary and scientific institution, and a museum. About four miles distant is Chatsworth House, the seat of the duke of Devonshire. Population in 1871, 2283.
