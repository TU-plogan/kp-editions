BASILISK, — βασιλίσκος of the Greeks, and Tsepha (cockatrice) of the Hebrews,—a name applied by the ancients to a horrid monster of their own imagination, to which they attributed the most malignant powers and an equally fiendish appearance. The term is now applied, owing to a certain fanciful resemblance, to a genus of Lizards belonging to the family Iguanidoe, the species of which are characterized by the presence of a membranous bag on the crown of the head, which they can distend or contract at will, and of a fin-like ridge along the back and part of the tail. Both appendages are admirably adapted for aiding the basilisk in swimming, while they do not impede its movements on land,—its mode of life being partly aquatic, partly arboreal. The Mitred Basilisk occurs in Guiana, the Hooded Basilisk in Amboyna.
