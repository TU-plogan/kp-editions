BALLANCHE, Pierre Simon, a distinguished French philosopher of the theocratic school, was born at Lyons in 1776. His health from infancy was extremely delicate, his nervous system was weak, and he was frequently subject to hallucinations and mental disorders. This weakness was much aggravated by his experience of the horrors consequent on the insurrection at Lyons and the siege of that town, during which he and his mother were compelled to take refuge in the country. His education seems never to have been very complete; but he was early imbued with ideas on the construction of society, which naturally sprang from the events of the revolutionary period. His first literary effort was an epic poem, describing the occurrences at Lyons; this he never published. In 1801 he wrote an essay Du Sentiment considéré dans la littérahire et dans les Arts, a work which shows very well the defects as well as the merits of his style and manner of thinking. It is essentially unsystematic; and the few good ideas contained in it are expressed in language so figurative that it costs an effort to discover what is really being said. Ballanche, indeed, was essentially unsystematic and unscientific, and seems to have had no conception of what is truly required in a philosophy. His style is not external to the thinking, but is undissolubly connected with it; strange thoughts and bizarre expressions arise together.

His next great work, the Antigone, a prose poem, published in 1814, was the fruit of long and quiet meditation, and was received with great favour by the brilliant literary society surrounding Chateaubriand and Mme. Récamier, into which Ballanche had been introduced. From this year, 1814, dates his serious effort towards a speculative reconstruction of society, an exposition of the palingenesis of social order. He transferred his residence to Paris, where he continued to live in communication with the few thinkers who had like philosophical tendencies with himself. In 1817 appeared his Essai sur les Institutions [9:3:286] Sociales dans leur rapport avec les Idées nouvelles, which was intended to serve as a prelude to his great tripartite social epic. The work is more intelligible than any other of Ballanche’s; it advocates a moderate constitutional government, and was, on this account, misjudged by many, who fancied it recommended Bourbonism. A philosophical dialogue, Le Vieillard et le Jeune Homme, and a novel, L'Homme sans Nom, were written in 1819 and 1820. He then devoted himself to his great work, the Palingénésie Sodale. This, which was to be a Theodicoea, an exposition of the workings of God in history, was divided into three parts: the first reconstructed that period of the world which was before the rise of religion, which is prehistoric, or mythical; the second endeavoured, from a study of known history, to deduce a universal law or rule; the third sketched that state of things through and in which humanity at last attains its final end and crowning glory. The works representing these three parts were called L'Orphée, La Formule, and La Ville des Expiations; only the first was completed, but some fragments of the others are in existence. To the whole a general introduction was prefixed, which is the most valuable of all Ballanche’s works. His latest writing, Vision d'Hébal (Hebal being the chief of a Scottish clan, and gifted with second sight), was evidently intended to form portion of the third part of the Palingénésie. In mystical language it gives vague and semi-prophetic utterances on the future course of worldhistory. It is by some considered his greatest production. Ballanche, who in 1841 had received the distinguished honour of a seat in the French Academy, died in 1847. He was much beloved by his friends, and seems to have been a most amiable, warm-hearted man, enthusiastic and poetical in temperament, whose intellect, however, was overshadowed by his imagination. A collected edition of his works was set on foot in 1830, and was intended to occupy nine vols. Only four appeared, and were republished in a smaller form in 1833.

It is almost impossible to give a connected view of Ballanche’s fundamental ideas. As has been said, he belonged to the theocratic school, who, in opposition to the rationalism of the preceding age, emphasised the principle of authority, placing revelation above individual reason, order above freedom and progress. But Ballanche made a sincere endeavour to unite in one system what was valuable in the opposed modes of thinking. He held with the theocratiste that individualism was an impracticable view; man, according to him, exists only in and through society. He agreed further with them that the origin of society was to be explained, not by human desire and efforts, but by a direct revelation from God. Lastly, with De Bonald, he reduced the problem of the origin of society to that of the origin of language, and held that language was a divine gift. But at this point he parts company with the theocratists, and in this very revelation of language finds a germ of progress. Originally, in the primitive state of man, speech and thought are identical; but gradually the two separate; language is no longer only spoken, it is also written, and finally is printed. Thus the primitive unity is broken up; the original social order which co-existed with, and was dependent on it, breaks up also. New institutions spring up, upon which thought acts, and in and through which it even draws nearer to a final unity, a rehabilitation, a palingenesis. The volition of primitive man was one with that of God, but it becomes broken up into separate volitions which oppose themselves to the divine will, and through the oppositions and trials of this world work onwards to a second and completer harmony. The history of humanity is therefore comprised in the fall from the perfect state, and in the return, after repeated, trials, to a similar condition. In the dim, shadowy records of mythical times may be traced the obscure outlines of primitive society and of its fall; and this is attempted in the Orphée. Actual history exhibits the conflict of two great principles, which may be said to be realised in the patricians and plebeians of Borne. Such a distinction of caste is regarded by Ballanche as the original state of historical society; and history, as a whole, he considers to have followed the same course as that taken by the Roman plebs in its gradual and successful attempts to attain equality with the patriciate. On the future events through which the human race shall achieve its destiny Ballanche gives few intelligible hints. The sudden flash which disclosed to the eyes of Hebal the whole epic of humanity cannot be reproduced in language trammelled by time and space. Scattered throughout the works of Ballanche are many valuable ideas on the connection of events which makes possible a philosophy of history; but his own theory, so far as it can be understood and judged, does not seem likely to find more favour than it has already met with.
