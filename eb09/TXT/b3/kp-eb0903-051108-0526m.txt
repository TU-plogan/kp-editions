BELA, or Beyla, a town of Baluchistan, capital of the province of Lus, on the north-eastern bank of the River Poorally, 293 miles N. of Khelat. Long. 66° 4' E., lat. 26° 1' N. About one-third of the town in the western quarter is encompassed by a mud wall. The streets are narrow; but from the elevated situation of the town, and its rocky site, they are always clean, even in wet weather. The bazaar is very neat. The governor’s residence is surrounded by a castellated mud-wall, which also encloses a dome-covered mosque. Population about 5000.
