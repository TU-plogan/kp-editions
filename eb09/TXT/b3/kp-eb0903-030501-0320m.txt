BALZAC, Jean Louis Guez de, a celebrated French writer, was born at Angoulême in 1594. His father was possessed of considerable property, and he himself was early befriended by the Cardinal de la Valette, who took him in his train to Rome. His letters written from that place to his acquaintances and to many who held a high position at the French court, were expressed so admirably, and showed such powers of eloquence, as to gain for him the highest renown. On his return from Italy he was at once and everywhere received as a master in the art of composition. The most extravagant compliments were showered upon him, and his head appears to have been turned a little by his success. In 1624 a collection of his Letters was published, and was received with great favour by the public. Soon afterwards a direct charge of plagiarism was made against Balzac in a pseudonymous tract, On the conformity of Μ. de Balzac's Eloquence with that of the Greatest Personages of Past and Present Time. A terribly fierce paper war was excited by this pamphlet; and Balzac, in disgust, retired to his own estate, where he continued his labour of composition. In 1634 he expressed a desire to enter the Academy, and was at once elected with universal acclamation. He died at Paris in 1654. His fame rests entirely upon the Letters, which, though empty, bombastic, and affected in matter, are written with great skill, and show a real mastery over the language. They introduced a new style; and Balzac has thus the credit of being the first reformer of French prose, as bis contemporary Malherbe was the first reformer of French poetry.
