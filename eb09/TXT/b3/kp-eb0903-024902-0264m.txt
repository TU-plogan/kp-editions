BAKER, Sir Richard, author of the Chronicle of the Kings of England, was born at Sissinghurst, in Kent, about the year 1568. He was educated at Oxford, took the degree of Master of Arts, and in 1603 received the honour of knighthood. In 1620 he was made high sheriff of Oxfordshire; but having engaged to paysome debts of his wife’s family, he was reduced to poverty, and obliged to betake himself for shelter to the Fleet prison, where he died, February 18, 1645. During his confinement he composed numerous works, historical, poetical, and miscellaneous. Amongst these are Meditations and Disquisitions on the Lord’s Prayer ,∖ Meditations, <fcc., on several of the Psalms of David; Meditations and Prayers upon the Seven Days of the Week; Cato Variegatus, or Cato’s Moral Distichs; Theatrum Triumphans, or Theatrum Redivivum, being a reply to Prynne’s Histriomastix, &c. His principal work, the Chronicle of the Kings of England, inexact and uncritical, but written in a pleasant and readable style, quickly acquired a high reputation. It was continued to 1658 by Edward Phillips, Milton’s nephew, and has passed through many editions.
