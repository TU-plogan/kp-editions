BASKERVILLE, John, a celebrated printer, and the introducer of many improvements in type-founding, was born at Wolverley in Worcestershire in 170G, and died in 1775. About the age of twenty he became a writingmaster at Birmingham, and he seems to have had a great talent for caligraphy and carving in stone. While at Birmingham his attention was attracted tc the business of japanning, which he took up with great zeal. He made some important improvements in the process, and gained a considerable fortune. About the year 1750 he began to make experiments in type-founding, and soon succeeded in producing types much superior in distinctness and elegance to any that had hitherto been employed. He then set up a printing-house, and published his first work, a Virgil in royal quarto. Horace, Terence, Catullus, and others were also printed by him. These books are admirable specimens of typography; and Baskerville is deservedly ranked among the foremost of those who have advanced the art of printing. He did not print many works, as the sale did not meet his expectations; after 1765, indeed, he seems to have put forth very little. Specimens from the Baskerville press are not easily had, and are of considerable value.
