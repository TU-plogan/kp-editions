BENNETT, James Gordon, American journalist, originator and editor of the New York Herald, was by birth a Scotchman. He was born at Newmills in Banffshire, about 1800. Destined for the priesthood in the Roman Catholic Church, he was educated in a seminary at Aberdeen, But it became evident that he was naturally unfit for the priestly calling; and his aversion ripened into a determination to escape from it. The reading of Franklin’s Autobiography led him to resolve on emigration to America, and in the spring of 1819 he sailed for the New World. Landing at Halifax, he earned a poor living there for a short time by giving lessons in French, Spanish, and bookkeeping; he passed next to Boston, where starvation almost threatened him till he got employment in a printing-office; and in 1822 he went to New York. An engagement as translator of Spanish for a newspaper took him for a few months to Charleston, South Carolina. On his return to New York he projected a school, gave lectures on political economy, and did subordinate work for the journals In 1825 he made his first attempt to establish a journal of his own; and the next ten years were occupied in a variety of similar attempts, which proved futile. During that period, however, he became Washington correspondent of the Inquirer; and his letters, written in imitation of the letters of Horace Walpole, attracted attention. Notwithstanding all his hard work and his resolutely abstemious life, he was still a poor man. It was not till 1835 that he struck the vein which was to reward and enrich him. On May 6 of that year appeared the first number of a small one-cent paper, bearing the title of New York Herald, and issuing from a cellar, in which the proprietor and editor played also the part of salesman. “He started with a disclaimer of all principle, as it is called, all party, all pohtics;* and to this he certainly adhered. By his immense industry and practical sagacity, his un-scrupulousnes¾ variety of news, spicy correspondence, supply of personal gossip and scandal, the paper became a great commercial success. Bennett continued to edit the Herald till his death. The successful mission of Stanley to Central Africa in search of Dr Livingstone, of whom nothing had long been heard, was undertaken by his desire and at his expense; and he thus showed in the last year of his life the inextinguishable spirit of enterprise which had animated him throughout his whole career. He died at New York, June 2, 1872.
