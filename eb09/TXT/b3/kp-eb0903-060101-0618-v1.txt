BERNADOTTE, Je an-Baptiste- J ules, afterwards King Chaules XIV. of Sweden and Norway, was the son of a lawyer at Pau in Béarn, and was born January 26, 1764. He was destined by his parents for the law, but chose the profession of arms, and enlisted in 1780 as a private in the royal marines. When the Revolution swept away the arbitrary distinction of classes, and opened up to all alike the path of preferment, the abilities of Bernadotte were speedily acknowledged. In 1792 he was made a colonel, in the following year a general of brigade, and soon after a general of division. In the campaigns of the Rhine and of Italy his military talents found ample scope for display; and his diplomatic abilities had also been tested as ambassador at the court of Vienna. During Bonaparte’s absence in Egypt Bernadotte was appointed minister of war. He reorganized the whole army, and prepared the way for the conquest of Holland. Notwithstanding the rivalry that all along existed between him and Napoleon, Bernadotte was made a marshal on the establishment of the empire. He was also nominated to the government of Hanover, and took part in the campaign of 1805 at the head of a force of 20,000 men. He distinguished himself at the battle of Austerlitz, and in 1806 he was created prince of PonteCorvo. In 1810 the death of Prince Augustenburg of Sweden having left the throne of that kingdom without an heir, the Swedish States in Council nominated Bernadotte as successor to Charles XIII. of Sweden, a distinction for which he was scarcely less indebted to his nobility of character than to his military talents. During the great campaigns of 1813 and 1814 Bernadotte joined the coalition against Napoleon, and it was his Swedish contingent that mainly decided the battle of Leipsic. It is stated, on good authority, that he had formed the ambitious design of succeeding the emperor on the French throne. As crown prince of Sweden he devoted his whole energies to the welfare of his adopted country. Owingto the infirmities of the king he was intrusted with the entire conduct of the government. On the death of Charles XIII., in February 1818, Bernadotte ascended the throne. For the events of his administration, so conducive to the prosperity of that country, the reader is referred to the article Sweden. He died at Stockholm, March 8, 1844, leaving an only son, Oscar, who succeeded him.
