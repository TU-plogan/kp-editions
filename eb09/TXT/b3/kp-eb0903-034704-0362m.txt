BANTRY, a small seaport situated on Bantry Bay, on the S.W. coast of Ireland, in the county of Cork. Lat. 51° 39' N., long. 9° 24' W. The trade of this port, formerly considerable, is now almost confined to the exportation of grain. The pilchard fishery was once very productive, but the fish has now deserted the coast. The population, which in 1831 was 4276, had decreased in 1871 to 2441 (including 409 in the island of Whiddy). The bay of the same name is about 25 miles long by 4 to 6 broad, has from 10 to 30 or 40 fathoms of water, and is surrounded by high mountains. It affords a very fine harbour for shipping, and contains tw o small islands, Bear and Whiddy. In 1796 a French fleet anchored here with the view of invading Ireland, and landed eight men, who were immediately taken prisoners.
