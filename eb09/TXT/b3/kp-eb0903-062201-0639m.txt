BEYROUT, Beirout, or Bairut, the most important seaport town of Syria, on the coast of the Mediterranean, in the pashalic of Acre, 57 miles W.N.W. of Damascus. It is situated on rising ground on the northern side of the promontory of the Jebel-er-Rosheh, which forms the spacious bay of St George’s, a short distance to the west of the mouth of a stream to which it gives its name—Nahr-Beirut, the ancient Magoras. The surrounding hills consist of reddish sand, interspersed with rocks, and covered with a light soil. The roadstead to the N.E. of the town is sheltered from the S.W. wind, but is exposed to the W. and the N.W. The ancient harbour is now choked up, and all that remains of the artificial erections is a pier or causeway at the N.W. extremity of the town, at which boats can discharge. It is supported on arches of unequal size, and is partly constructed of ancient marble columns, many of which still stand along its front, and are used for mooring the lesser vessels. In 1874 the authorities determined to construct a small harbour, and <£10,000 was allotted for the purpose. The city proper is an irregular square, open towards the sea, and surrounded on the land sides by a substantial tower-flanked wall, built by Djezzar Pasha. At the N.W. corner are two castellated buildings, built on the rocks. The streets are wider than is usual in Syrian towns, and are paved with large stones; the houses are for the most part lofty and spacious. Formerly, there were deep channels of water flowing down the middle of the streets, but these have been removed. The suburbs of the city, which extend around it with a radius of a mile and a half, are beautifully situated, interspersed with gardens, and planted with fruit trees. During the hot season the wealthier inhabitants remove inland to the villages of Beit-Miry, Brumanah, or Shemlin, on the lower slopes of the Lebanon. Besides the mosques, bazaars, and other native buildings with which it is provided, the city of Beyrout possesses numerous European edifices and institutions. There are six Roman Catholic convents or monasteries, with churches and schools attached, and the sisters of charity maintain an orphanage and hospital. The Prussians support a well-organized school, under the management of a Protestant sisterhood, and the American missionaries have, among other establishments, a hospital and medical school. A girl’s school was begun in 1860 bj' Mrs Thompson, and a ragged school in 1863. A native Christian community has been for some time in existence; and in 1847 a native society of arts and sciences was established. Formerly regarded as the port of Damascus, Beyrout has now become by far the more important of the two cities. It is the seat of various consular establishments, and possesses a quarantine, a custom-house, and post-offices. It exports silk, wool, bitumen, rags, sponges, and skins, and imports European goods for a large part of Syria. In 1871 the value of the exports, which were destined chiefly for France and England, was £530,000; while that of the imports, which were mainly from England and Germany, amounted to £1,240,000. The coasting trade, earned on by small native craft, consists principally of timber, firewood, charcoal, and straw. A lighthouse, 98 feet high, was erected in 1864 on the neighbouring cape of Ras Beyrout. A carriage road was constructed, by a French company about 1863, connecting Beyrout with Damascus. An English company completed[9:3:623] in 1874 an extensive system of water-works, by which a large supply is brought from the Nahr-el-Kelb (the Dog River or Lycus), a distance of 9 miles; the aqueduct is taken at one place through a tunnel 1040 yards long, and the water is brought to two reservoirs at the entrance of the town, each of a capacity of 110,000 cubic feet; public fountains, barracks, and mosques are supplied free of charge. The population is of a various character, comprising Druses, Maronites, Greeks, Turks, Arabs, and other races or nationalities. It was greatly increased about 1860 by an immigration of Christian natives who had fled from persecution in Mount Lebanon, Hasbeya, and Damascus. Estimated at only 15,000 in 1838, the number of inhabitants had risen in 1871 to 70,000.

Beyrout is a place of great antiquity, and may perhaps be identified with the Berothah of the Phoenicians. For a time at least it was under the supremacy of Sidon. Destroyed by Trypho, the Syrian usurper, about 140 b.c., it was restored by the elder Agrippa about 41 A.D., raised to the rank of a Roman colony, and adorned with an amphitheatre and various splendid buildings. In the 3d century it became the scat of a school of jurisprudence, which long maintained its reputation, and was attended by several eminent men. During the reign of Justinian, in fact, Beyrout was the only place in the empire, except Rome and Constantinople, where law was permitted to be taught, and of the three the Syrian school, under the management of Theophilus and Dorotheus, appears to have stood highest in general estimation. But the injury inflicted on the city by an earthquake in 551 led to the removal of the school to Sidon, and not long after the building in which it had been held was totally consumed by fire. In the time of the Crusades Beyrout again rose into importance, and was captured by Baldwin I. in 1111, after a two months’ siege. Early in the 17th century it became a chief seat of the Druses, who retained their possession till 1763, when it was betrayed into the hands of the Turks. In 1772 it was bombarded and plundered by a Russian fleet, and in 1840 it was nearly destroyed by the attack of the English under Admiral Stopford.
