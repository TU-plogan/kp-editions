BARBUDA, one of the lesser Antilles or Caribbean islands, is 10 miles in length by about 8 in breadth, presenting a very flat surface, covered to a great extent with woods, in which deer abound. Many varieties of shell-fish and other fish are found on the coast, which is also frequented by large flocks of water-fowl. The part of the island under cultivation is fertile; corn, cotton, sugar, tobacco, and indigo are grown; and the rearing of cattle is one of the principal occupations. So salubrious is the climate that Barbuda serves as a kind of sanitarium for the adjacent islands. The inhabitants, who number less than 2000, are mainly negroes. The island was annexed to Britain in 1628, and was bestowed in 1680 on the Codrington family, in whose possession it still remains. The north point is in lat. 17° 33' N. and long. 61° 43' W.
