BÀLÂGHÀT, a British district in the Central Provinces of India, situated between 21° and 23° N. lat. and 80° and

8I o E. long.; bounded on the N. by the district of Mandlâ; on the E. by the district of Chhattisgarh; on the S. by Chhattisgarh and Bhandârâ; and on the W. by the district of Seoni. Bâlâghât forms the eastern portion of the central plateau which divides the province from east to west. These highlands, formerly known as the Râigarh Bichhiâ tract, remained desolate and neglected until 1866, when the district of Bâlâghât was formed, and the country opened to the industrious and enterprising peasantry of the Waingangâ valley. Geographically the district is divided into three distinct parts (1.) The southern lowlands, a slightly undulating plain, comparatively well cultivated, and drained by the Waingangâ, Bâgh, Deo, Ghisri, and Son rivers. (2.) The long narrow valley, known as the Mau Tâlukâ, lying between the hills and the Waingangâ river, and comprising a long, narrow, irregular-shaped lowland tract, intersected by hill ranges and peaks covered with dense jungle, and running generally from north to south. (3.) The lofty plateau, in which is situated the Râigârh Bichhiâ tract, comprising irregular ranges of hills, broken into numerous valleys, and generally running from east to west. The highest points in the hills of the district are as follows :—Peaks above Lânjf, 2300 or 2500 feet; Tepâgarh hill, about 2600 feet; and Bhainsâghât range, about 3000 feet above the sea. The principal rivers in the district are the Waingangâ, and its tributaries, the Bâgh, Nahrâ, and Uskâl; a few smaller streams, such as the Masmâr, the Mâhkârâ, &c.; and the Banjâr, Hâlon, and Jamuniâ, tributaries of the Narbadâ, which drain a portion of the upper plateau. Bâlâghât contains very extensive forests, but they do not produce timber of any great value. They teem with wild animals, from the great bison to the fox; 470 beasts and venomous snakes were killed in 1867-68, a total reward of XI56 being paid under this head. The district contained in 1868 an assessed area of 1462Ό8 square miles or 935,731 acres, of which 214,587 acres were under cultivation; 488,510 grazing lands; 116,938 culturable, but not actually under cultivation; 115,696 unculturable waste. The census report of 1872 returned the area at 2608 square miles. The census of 1866 showed a population of 170,964. This had in 1872 increased to 195,008, residing in 37,192 houses and 781 villages; average number of persons per square mile, 74*77; per village, 249’69; per house, 5 , 24. Of the total population, 131,176 or 67 - 27 per cent, were Hindus; 2934 or 150 per cent. Mahometans; 39 Buddhists; 11 Christians; 60,848 or 31 ’ 20 percent, of unspecified religions of aboriginal or imperfectly Hinduised types.

Since 1867 considerable encouragement has been given to the cultivating tribes of Ponwârs, Kunbis, Marârs, &c., of the low country to immigrate, and take up lands in the upland tracts. By this means a large quantity of jungle lands has lately come under cultivation. The acreage under the principal crops grown in the district is returned as follows :—rice, 188,312 acres; wheat, 585; other food grains, 8770; oil-seeds, 3436; sugar, 505; fibres, 100; tobacco, 638; total, 202,346 acres. Iron is smelted by the Gonds; gold exists in the beds of some of the rivers, but not in sufficient quantities to repay the labour of washing. There are no regularly made roads in the district. Five passes lead from the low country to the highlands, viz., the Bânpur Ghât, the Warai Ghât, the Pancherâ Ghât, the Bhondwâ Ghât, and the Ahmadpur Ghât. For revenue purposes the district is divided into two subdivisions, the Bùrhâ Tahsil and the Paraswârâ Tahsfl. In 1868-69 the total revenue of the Bâlâghât district amounted to £11,746, of which £6754, or 57 per cent., was from land. For the protection of person and property, Government maintained, in 1868, 115 policemen, at a total cost of £1156, 16s. In 1868 only two towns in the district[9:3:261] had upwards of 2000 inhabitants, viz., Hattá, population, 2608, and Lanjí, population, 2116. About 60 years ago the upper part of the district was an impenetrable waste. About that time one Lachhman Náik established the first villages on the Paraswárá plateau, on which there are about 30 flourishing settlements. But a handsome Buddhist temple of cut stone, belonging to some remote period, is suggestive of a civilization which had disappeared before historic times.
