BEUTHEN, the chief town of a circle in the government of Oppeln in Prussian Silesia, on the railway between Oppeln and Cracow, about 50 miles from the former. It is the centre of the mining district of Upper Silesia, and its population, which numbered 15,711 in 1871, is mainly engaged in mining operations. Cloth and linen weaving, however, is also carried on. Beuthen is an old town, and was formerly the capital of the lordship of Beuthen, which belonged to the counts of Donnersmark. It is frequently called Ober Beuthen to distinguish it from the following.
