BARCLAY, John, M.D., an eminent anatomist, was born in Perthshire in 1760, and died at Edinburgh in 1826. After the usual routine of parochial education, he completed his academical course at the United College of St Andrews. He subsequently studied divinity there, and was licensed as a preacher by the Presbytery of Dunkeld. Having repaired to Edinburgh in 1789, as tutor to the family of Sir James Campbell of Aberuchill, he began to give his attention to the study of medicine, and particularly to human and comparative anatomy. He became assistant to Mr John Bell, and took the degree of M.D. in 1796, after having defended an inaugural dissertation, De Anima seu Principio Vitali, a subject which occupied his maturer powers towards the close of his life. Immediately after his graduation, he repaired to London, and studied for some time under Dr Marshall, at that time a very distinguished teacher of anatomy in the metropolis. Soon after his return to Edinburgh, he commenced his lectures on anatomy in November 1797, and speedily attracted an audience, which increased considerably in numbers until the period of his retirement, a short time before his death.

Of Barclay’s professional writings, the earliest, we believe, was the article Physiology, contributed to the third edition of this work. In 1803 he attempted a reform in the language of anatomy, with a view to render it more accurate and precise,—a task for which his acquirements as a classical scholar rendered him peculiarly well qualified. Although the Nomenclature which he published in that year has not been generally adopted, the profession acknowledged the importance of the object which he had in view, as well as the talent and learning with which it was executed. In 1808 he published his Treatise on the Muscular Motions of the Human Body, and in 1812 his Description of the Arteries of the Human Body, a work displaying much acute observation and laborious research, which may be considered the most practically useful of all his writings. His last publication, completed only a few years before his death, was An Inquiry into the Opinions, Ancient and Modem, concerning Life and Organization, a work replete with learning and sound original criticism. His introductory lectures published after his death contain a valuable abridgment of the history of anatomy.
