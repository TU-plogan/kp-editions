BÄNKURÄ, a district of British India, within the BardwAn division, under the Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, situated in 22° and 23° N. lat., and 86° and 87° E. long., bounded on the N. and E. by BardwAn district; on the S. by Midnapur district; and on the W. by MAnbhιim district. BAnkurA forms a connecting link between the delta of the Ganges on the E. and the mountainous highlands of ChhotA NAgpur on the W. Along its eastern boundary adjoining BardwAn district the country is flat and alluvial, presenting the appearance of the ordinary paddy lands of Bengal. Going N. and W., however, the surface gradually rises into long undulating tracts; rice lands and swamps give way to a region of low thorny jungle or forest trees; the hamlets become smaller and more scattered, and nearly disappear altogether in the wild forests along the western boundary. The principal hills are—MAnjiA hill, on the south bank of the DAmodar; Koro hill, S. of the foregoing; SusuniA hill, W. of Koro; and BehArinAth hill, in the N.W. corner of the district. The rivers are merely mountain torrents—the largest, the DAmodar, being only navigable by country boats during the rains. The census of 1872 returned the population of the district at 526,772 souls, inhabiting 2028 villages, and 104,687 houses; average density of population, 391 to the square mile. The Hindus numbered 487,786, or 92 - 6 per cent, of the total population; Mahometans, 13,500; Christians, 70; and persons of unspecified religion, chiefly aboriginal tribes, 25,416.

District area, after recent transfers to and from the districts of BardwAn and MAnbhAm in 1872, 1346 square miles. Before these transfers the area was returned at 1350 square miles, of which 630 were said to be cultivated, 540 cultivable but not cultivated, and 180 uncultivable waste. Agricultural products—rice, barley, cotton, indigo, oil-seeds, and pulses. Minerals—coal, lime, and building stone. In its manufactures, the district is noted for fine descriptions of coloured silk cloths. Exports—rice, oil-seeds, lac, tamarind, silk cloth, silk cocoons, &c. Imports—English piece goods, salt, tobacco, spices, cocoa-nuts, turmeric, and different kinds of pulses. Chief trading towns and seats of commerce—BAnkurA, Bishnupur, RAjgrAm, and BarjorA. Three main lines of road traverse tho district. The total revenue increased from £40,934 in 1835-36 to £66,392 in 1870-71, and the civil expenditure from £8006 to £17,487 within the same period. BAnkurA is a permanently settled district. In 1870-71 the district contained 910 estates, held by 1351 proprietors, and paying a total Government land revenue of £45,362. Besides the land revenue, the following are returned as the other sources of revenue in 1870-71, viz., assessed taxes, £5455; excise, £3167; stamps, £6787; law and justice, £30,478; law charges, £62; and local and provincial funds, £2512. The police force in 1871 numbered 5681 men, maintained at a cost of £23,656. The district contained 515 schools in 1871-72, attended by 14,676 pupils; maintained at a total cost of £4602, of which Government paid £1291. The climate of BAnkurA is generally healthy, the cold season being bracing, the air wholesome and dry, and fogs of rare occurrence. The temperature in the hot season is very oppressive and relaxing. Rainfall in 1868, 61 , 25 inches; minimum temperature in the same year, 62°; maximum, 98°. The prevailing diseases in the district are intermittent fever, leprosy, and occasionally diarrhoea and dysentery. Cholera visited the district in an epidemic form in the years 1855, 1860, 1864, 1866-67, and 1869, that of the first year being the severest. BankurA suffered greatly from the famine of 1865-66. Two towns contain a population of upwards of 5000—1. BankurA, the administrative headquarters; population, 16,794; municipal income in 1872, £551; expenditure, £476. 2. Bishnupur—population, 18,047; municipal income, £273; expenditure, £192. The Bishnupur RAj was one of the largest estates in Bengal in the end of the last century, but it was sold for arrears of revenue shortly after the conclusion of the permanent settlement in 1793.

Bànkurà, the principal town of the district of the same name, in 23° 14'N. lat., and 87° 6' 45" E. long., stands on an elevation on the left bank of the River Dhalkisor. It has a bAzAr, a spacious building for the accommodation of travellers, and the district courts, school, jail, post-office, &c. In 1872 the population amounted to 16,794.
