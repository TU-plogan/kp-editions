BLOW, John, an English musical composer, was born in 1648 at North Collingham in Nottinghamshire. He was educated at the chapel royal, and distinguished himself by his proficiency in music, having composed several anthems at an unusually early age. In 1673 he was made a gentleman of the chapel royal, and in 1685 was named one of the private musicians of James II. In 1687 he became master of the choir of St Paul’s Church; in 1695 he was elected organist of St Margaret’s, Westminster, and in 1699 composer to the chapel royal. In 1700 he published his Amphion Anglicus, a collection of pieces of music for one, two, three, and four voices, with a figured-bass accompaniment. Doctor Burney says that in the Amphion [9:3:837] Λnglicus “ the union of Scottish melody with the English is first conspicuous.” Blow died in 1708, and was buried in the north aisle of Westminster Abbey. None of his compositions, most of which are anthems, attain the highest order of merit.
