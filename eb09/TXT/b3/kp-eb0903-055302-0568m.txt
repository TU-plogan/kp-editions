BELON, Pierre, French naturalist, was born about 1517 at the hamlet of Soulletière, in Maine. He studied medicine at Paris and took the degree of doctor. He afterwards travelled in Germany, and heard some lectures at the famous University of Wittenberg. On his return to France he was taken under the patronage of the Cardinal de Tournon, who furnished him with means for undertaking an extensive scientific journey. Belon started in 1546, travelled through Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt, Arabia, and Palestine, and returned in 1549. A full account of his travels, with illustrations, was published in 1553. It passed through several editions, and was translated into Latin and German. Belon, who was highly favoured both by Henry II. and by Charles IX., was assassinated one evening in April 1564, when coming through the Bois de Boulogne. Besides the narrative of his travels he wrote several scientific works of considerable value, particularly the Histoire Naturelle des Estranges Poissons, 1551, and L’Histoire de la Nature des Oy seaux, 1555.
