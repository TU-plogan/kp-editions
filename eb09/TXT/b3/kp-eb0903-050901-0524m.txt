BEHBEHAN, a town of Persia, in the province of Fars, pleasantly situated in the middle of a highly-cultivated plain, which is watered by the Rivers Zab and Jerahi. The walls are about three miles in circumference; and there is a castle called Kal√¢h NAranj, or Orange Castle, in the S.E. corner. The population is variously estimated at 10,000 and at 4000, the latter mere probably correct, as the place has suffered from plague and oppression.
