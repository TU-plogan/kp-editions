BELGIUM

BELGIUM (Fr. Belgique, Ger. Belgien), is one of the smaller of the European states, among which it ranks 16th in point of area and 8th according to population. It lies between lat. 49° 30' and 51° 30' N., and long. 2° 32' and 6° 7' E.; and is bounded on the N. by Holland, E. by Dutch Limbourg, Luxembourg, and Rhenish Prussia, S. and S.W. by France, and N.W. by the North Sea. It is somewhat triangular in form, the longest side—that which adjoins France—being 384 miles in length. The length of its other boundaries are,—towards Holland 268 miles, Germany 59, Luxembourg 80, and the North Sea 41. Its greatest length from N.W. to S.E. (from Ostend to Arion) is 174 miles, and its greatest breadth from N. to S. 105. It has an area of 2,945,593 hectares, equal to 7,278,968 English acres, or 11,373 square miles,—being about one-eighth of the area of Great Britain. This country is divided into nine provinces,—Antwerp in the N., West and Fast Flanders and Hainault in the W., Namur in the S., Luxembourg in the S.E., Liège and Limbourg in the E., and Brabant in the centre.

Belgium is in general a very flat country having few elevations, and these rarely exceeding 2000 feet in height. They are principally to be found in the E. and S.E., while the N. and N.W. parts of the country bear a considerable resemblance to Holland. The elevations of Belgium take their rise in France, and extend generally in a N.E. direction[9:3:515]. A chain proceeding from the neighbourhood of the sources of the Saone separates the waters of the Meuse from those of the Moselle, passes Arion and Neufchateau, then extends in a north-eastern direction towards Bastogne, and finally enters Prussia. A branch of this chain goes off at Neufchateau, proceeds northward towards Liege, passes St Hubert, and separates the Ourthe from the Meuse. A part of the Ardennes also extends into Belgium, and separates the basin of the Meuse from that of the Scheldt. It proceeds in a north-eastern direction, passing Fontaine ΓEvcque, Gembloux, Ramillies, and Tongres, then, gradually decreasing in height, it turns northward to Asch, and afterwards N. W. to Hechtal, Lommel, and Turnhout. A series of heights on the frontier of France, near Chimay, extends in a N.W. direction towards Namur, and separatee the Meuse from the Sambre.

The provinces of Liège, Luxembourg, and Namur present the greatest irregularities of surface. This part of the country is intersected by numerous ravines and streams with steep and rocky banks, by deep valleys, and by ridges of hills, which often have precipitous and rocky escarpments. The vegetation here is of a very poor and languid character. The greater part of the region is covered with dense forests, marshy and uncultivated plateaus or poor pasture land, and corn is very rarely cultivated. Descending towards the coast the forests become less extensive; and rye, oats, and potatoes take the place of the pasture land. In the western and north-western provinces are extensive and well-watered plains, which, from their great fertility and the high state of their cultivation, are the boast of the Belgians and the admiration of strangers.

In the provinces bordering on the sea the land is in some places so low as to require to be protected from inundation by dikes. These parts are called polders. Numerous places along the banks, of the rivers are also protected by embankments; these are called interior polders. About a sixtieth part of the kingdom (50,000 hectares, or 193 square miles) is thus artificially gained from the sea and rivers.

The coast of Belgium is said to be undergoing a change similar to that of Scandinavia,—in some parts a gradual elevation, and in others a gradual depression. Nieuport is said to be on the axis of this change, from which, northward to the mouth of the Scheldt, the sea is continually gaining upon the land, while southward to Pas de Calais it is losing.

The principal rivers are the Scheldt, Meuse, and Yzer, with their tributaries. The Scheldt is navigable during its entire course through Belgium, and has a general direction from S.W. to N.E., passing through the province of l·Iainault, along the eastern boundary of West Flanders, traversing East Flanders, and finally forming the boundary between the provinces of East Flanders and Antwerp. Its entire length through Belgium is 108 miles. The Meuse has a course nearly parallel to that of the Scheldt, traversing the provinces of Namur, Liège, and Limbourg. It is 115 miles in length, during the whole of which it is navigable. The small river of Yzer, which enters the sea at Nieuport, is navigable for about 26 miles. The navigable rivers connected with the Scheldt are,—the Dyle, which after receiving the Nethe at the village of Rumpst, takes the name of Ruppel, and joins the Scheldt nearly opposite to Ruppelsmonde; the Great and Little Nethe, which after their junction take the name of Nethe, and fall into the Dyle; the Demer, also an affluent of the Dyle; the Dender, which enters the Scheldt at Deadermonde; the Durme, which joins it near Thielrode; and the Lys at Ghent. The entire navigable length of these streams is 230 English miles. The navigable rivers of the Meuse are the Amblere and the Vesdre, affluents of the Ourthe; the Ourthe, which joins the Meuse at Liège; and the Sambre, which joins it at Namur. The navigable length of these is 142 miles. The small river of Yperlee, which joins the Yzer, is navigable for about 9 miles. The other streams are the Senne, the Haine, the Semoy, and the Lesse.

Beside≡ these navigable rivers, Belgium has a number of canals for inland navigation, some of which are used also for irrigation. They are twenty-nine in number, and their entire length is 605,440 metres, or 376 English miles. The principal of these are the canals—from Bruges to Ostend, from Brussels to Charleroi, from Bocholt to Heren-thal, from Brussels to Willebroeck, from Ghent to Bruges, from Liège to Maestricht, from Maestricht to Bois-le-Duc, from Fommeroeul to Antoing, from Plasschendaele to Nieuport, the Louvain canal, the Lieve, and the Moevaert. Each of these canals is upwards of 12 miles in length, and the longest, that from Brussels to Charleroi, upwards of 46 miles. The entire length of the river and canal navigation of Belgium is 1006 English miles.

Belgium possesses a number of mineral springs, the principal of which are the hot springs of Chaudfontaine, situated about five miles from Liège, and the mineral spring of Tongres; but the most celebrated waters are those of Spa. The ferruginous springs of Huy were formerly in considerable repute, but are now little used.

The climate of Belgium is similar to that of England, but is a little colder in winter and hotter in summer. In the south-eastern parts the atmosphere is more pure and bracing than in the lower parts towards the N.W., where it is frequently damp and hazy. Frost rarely appears before the middle of October or after the middle of April. Observations made at Brussels from 1833 to 1872 give the mean annual temperature as 50° ∙6 Fahr.,—the mean maximum being 57° '2, and the mean minimum 44 n T Fahr. During that period there were no frosts in the five months from May to September inclusive, and snow fell only eight times in May and four times in October. The average number of foggy days annually, from 1833 to 1862, was 60, and with thunder 15. The annual average of days on which rain fell was 197, and the quantity of rain 28Ό4 inches, or 3 inches less than the rainfall at London.

The population of Belgium in 1831 was 3,785,814; in 1840,4,073,162; in 1850,4,426,202; in 1860,4,731,957, and in 1873, 5,253,821, being 2,645,147 males and 2,608,674 females. The following table shows the population of the different provinces in each of the years 1831, 1850, and 1873 (31st December) :—
[table]

The principal towns are—Brussels, with 180,172 inhabitants; Antwerp, 141,910; Ghent, 128,424; Liège, 113,774; Bruges, 48,113; Verviers, 38,875; Tournay, 31,923; Malines, 38,540; Louvain, 32,314.

Belgium is the most densely populated country of Europe, having on an average 178 inhabitants to the square kilometre, which is equivalent to 461 to the square mile. The density differs greatly in the several provinces, being as high as 285 per square kilometre in East Flanders, 281 in Brabant, and 250 in Hainault; and as low as 86 in Namur, 84 in Limbourg, and 47 in Luxembourg. The general census of 1866 gives 134,001 as under one year of age; 549,077 between one and five years, and 494,332 between five and ten; while 299,711 were from sixty to seventy, 115,216 from seventy to eighty, 23,890 from eighty to ninety, 1292 from ninety to a hundred, and 12 a hundred and upwards. The number of [9:3:516] unmarried persons was 3,011,566, of married persons 1,528,543, of widowers and widows 287,724. As regards their places of birth, 3,348,506 had been born in the same commune in which they lived; 1,381,231 had been born in another commune of the same province; 288,672 had been born in another province of the kingdom, 13,044 in the ceded districts of Luxembourg or Limbourg, 26,435 in other parts of Holland, 32,021 in France, 20,701 in Germany, 3003 in England, and 2892 in other countries. In 1873 the births were 17'ζ708, being 87,128 males, and 83,580 females, or 104 males to 100 females,—giving one birth to every 30 - 3 of the population, and 151 births to a hundred deaths. Of the births 158,585 were legitimate and 12,123 illegitimate, or 13 legitimate births to 1 illegitimate. The proportion, however, varies much in the different provinces, being 7 - 5 to 1 in Brabant, and 37 to 1 in Luxembourg. The number of marriages that took place was 40,598, and of deaths 112,873. Of the latter, 24,282 were under one year, and 16,730 between one and five years of age; 315 males and 62 females were by suicide, 2068 were from accidents, and 69 were murdered. The immigrations were 15,792, and the emigrations 7981.

The languages spoken in Belgium are French or Walloon (a dialect of the ancient French), and Flemish or Dutch. French is the language of the upper and educated classes, and is generally understood even in the Flemish parts of the kingdom. In 1866 those speaking French or Walloon amounted to 2,041,784; Flemish or Dutch, 2,406,991; French and Flemish, 308,361; German, 35,356; French and German, 20,448; Flemish and German, 1625; and the three languages, 4966. The French or Walloon is the prevailing language in the provinces of Hainault, Liège, Luxembourg, and Namur; the Flemish or Dutch in Antwerp, Brabant, the two Flanders, and Limbourg.

Since the formation of Belgium into an independent state, the Government has taken a laudable interest in all that concerns the advancement and happiness of the people; and not being trammelled by a respect for old laws or useless customs, it has adopted, as far as possible, the most improved systems of other countries. The whole system of government is based upon the broadest principles of rational freedom and liberality. All power emanates from the people, and can be exercised only according to law. The people are upon a strict equality in the eye of the law; personal liberty is guaranteed to all, as well as entire freedom in opinion and in religious worship. All the religious sects are endowed by the state, and large grants are also given annually for educational and charitable purposes. Home is inviolable, nor can any one be deprived of his property unless for the good of the state and for a suitable indemnity. Justice is open to all, as well as the means of education, and the benefits of the public charities. The press is free, and civil death is abolished. Any one may address petitions to the public authorities signed by one or more persons. Trial by jury is established for all criminal and political charges, and for offences of the press. The contents of letters are inviolable, and the post-office is responsible for all letters committed to it.

The government is a constitutional representative and hereditary monarchy. The legislative power is vested in the king, the chamber of representatives, and the senate. The judicial power is exercised by fixed tribunals, freed from all authoritative influences, judging publicly, and assigning reasons for their decisions. Affairs exclusively provincial or communal are managed by the provincial or communal councils.

The royal succession is in the direct male , line in the Order of primogeniture, to the exclusion of females and their descendants. The king’s person is declared sacred, and his ministers are held responsible for the acts of the Government No act of the king can have effect unless countersigned by one of his ministers, who thus becomes the responsible party. The king convokes, prorogues, and dissolves the chambers, and makes rules and orders necessary for the execution of the laws, but has no power to suspend or dispense with the execution of the laws themselves. He nominates to civil and military ofticee, and commands the sea and land forces. He declares war, and concludes treaties of peace, of alliance, and of commerce,—communicating the same to the chambers as far as may be consistent with the interest and safety of the state. He sanctions and promulgates the laws, and has the power of remitting or reducing the punishments pronounced by the judges, except in the case of his ministers, to whom he can extend pardon only at the request of one of the chambers. In default of male heirs the king may nominate his successor with the consent of the chambers. The regency can only be conferred upon one person, and no change in the constitution can be made under his rule.

The people are represented in the Legislature by the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, the members of which are chosen by the people. Each chamber determines the manner of exercising its own powers, and every session nominates its president and vice-presidents, and forms its bureau. No petition can be presented personally; and every resolution is adopted by the absolute majority, except in some special cases, when two-thirds of the votes of the members are required to be favourable; in the case of an equality of votes the proposition is thrown out. The chambers meet annually in the month of November, and should sit for at least forty days; but the king has the power of convoking them on extraordinary occasions, and of dissolving them either simultaneously or separately. On dissolution a new election must take place within forty days, and a meeting of the chambers within two months. An adjournment cannot be made for a period exceeding one month without the consent of the chambers.

The Chamber of Representatives is composed of deputies chosen directly by the people paying a certain amount of direct taxes. ' The number of deputies is fixed according to the population, and cannot exceed one member for every 40,000 inhabitants; at present they amount to 124. To be eligible for membership it is necessary to be a Belgian by birth or to have received the grand naturalization, to be in the possession of the civil and political rights of the kingdom, to have attained the age of twenty-five years, and to be resident in Belgium. The members not residing in the town where the chamber sits receive, during the session, an indemnity of 200 florins (£16, 13s. 4d.) each per month. The members are elected for four years, one-half going out every two years, except in the case of a dissolution, when a general election takes place. This chamber has the parliamentary initiative and the·preliminary vote in all cases relating to the receipts and expenses of the state, and to the contingent of the army.

The electors of the Chamber of Representatives have also the nomination of the members of the Senate. To be eligible as a senator it is necessary to be a Belgian by birth or to have received the grand naturalization, to be in the enjoyment of civil and political rights, to be domiciled in Belgium, to be forty years of age, and to pay at least 1000 florins (£84) of direct taxes. In those provinces where the number of those paying 1000 florins of taxes does not amount to one in every 6000 inhabitants, this proportion is made up by those paying the highest amount below that sum. The permanent deputations of the provincial councils annually prepare a list of those who are eligible to the Senate. In 1874 the number of these was 453. At the age of eighteen the heir-presumptive to the throne has a seat in the Senate, but he has no voice in its deliberations till he attain the age of twenty-five. The senators receive no indemnity. They are elected for eight years, one-half going out every four years, except in the case of a dissolution. The Senate is composed of half as many members as the Chamber of Representatives, the number at present being 62.
[9:3:517]

In order to be a general elector it is necessary to be a Belgian by birth or to have received the grand naturalization, to be twenty-one years of age, and to pay direct taxes to the amount of at least 20 florins (33s. 4d.) In 1874 the total number of general electors was 111,135, or at the rate of 21 15 per 1000 of the population.

The king appoints and dismisses his ministers at pleasure. No member of the royal family can be a minister, nor any but a Belgian, or one who has received the grand naturalization. Ministers have a right of admission to the chambers, and may demand a hearing; but they have no voice in the deliberations unless they are members. The chambers can at any time require the presence of the ministers. No act or writing by the king can free a minister from responsibility. The Chamber of Representatives has the power of accusing the ministers, and of bringing them before the court of cassation, which alone has the right of judging them, in all cases of offences committed in the exercise of their functions. There are six ministers, viz., of foreign affairs, of the interior, of justice, of finance, of war, and of public works.

Naturalization is of two kinds, the one conferring on the foreigner all the civil and political rights belonging to a Belgian, with certain exceptions specified by law, such as the right to vote in the choice of members for the legislative chambers or of sitting there; to obtain these the grand naturalization is requisite. The registration-fee for the former is 500 francs; for the latter, 1000. Since 1831 only 47 have received the grand naturalization and 1527 the ordinary.

For civil purposes the provinces are divided into 26 arrondissements, 204 justice-of-peace cantons, and 2528 communes; and for military purposes, into 41 arrondissements, 303 military cantons, and 2568 communes.

In each province is a governor named directly by the king, for the purpose of superintending and securing the due execution of the laws, and a provincial council, composed of Belgian citizens at least twenty-five years of age, residing in the province, and in the enjoyment of civil and political rights. The number of members of each provincial council is made to depend upon the population, and varies in the different provinces from one for every 11,500 of the population in Brabant and Hainault, to one for every 5000 in Limbourg and Luxembourg. Each canton, however, is entitled to be represented by at least one member, and the number of members for each canton depends upon the population according to the scale fixed for the province. The total number of members in 1874 was 559,—Antwerp council having 58; Brabant, 73; East Flanders, 80; West Flanders, 69; Hainault, 76; Liège, 67; Limbourg, 40; Luxembourg, 41; and Namur, 55. The electors of the members of the provincial councils were formerly the same as the electors of the legislative chambers, but in 1872 the provincial franchise was lowered, and the number of electors in 1874 was 219,619, or41 , 80to 1000 inhabitants. A provincial elector requires to be a Belgian or to have received naturalization, and to pay taxes to the amount of 20 francs (16s.) Members of the chambers, governors, and persons in the employment of the state or province, are ineligible as councillors. The councils have an annual session of not more than four weeks; but the king can convoke them on extraordinary occasions. Those not residing in the provincial capital receive an indemnity during the session. Each provincial council appoints a permanent deputation for conducting business in the interval between the sessions, particularly in matters requiring immediate attention. It is composed of six members chosen for four years, one-half going out every two years.

These councils are of the highest importance to the country. They watch over the interests of their several provinces, prepare the budgets, direct taxation, and superintend public works. They give a healthy impulse to agriculture, trade, and commerce; direct the construction of roads, canals, and bridges; and extend the benefits of education and religion throughout the country. The communes have the power of appeal to the king if they consider themselves aggrieved by any of the acts of the provincial council, or of the permanent deputation.

Matters exclusively communal are managed by communal councils. The councillors are Belgian citizens in the full enjoyment of civil and political rights, and, except in some special cases, resident in the commune. They are elected for six years, one-half going out every three years. The number of the councillors is from 7 to 31, in proportion to the population of the commune, which varies from under 1000 to upwards of 70,000 inhabitants. Communal electors require to be Belgians or to have received naturalization, and to pay taxes to the amount of 10 francs (4s.) The total number of electors in 1874 was 347,441, being 66Ί3 per 1000 of the population. Communes with less than 20,000 inhabitants have two aidermen, and those having more than that number have four. There is also in each commune a burgomaster, who, as well as the aidermen, is chosen by the king from among the members of the communal council.

Full liberty is guaranteed to all in the exercise of the public or private rites of their worship; nor does the state interfere in any way in matters of religion, except where the public safety may be concerned or the laws infringed. Almost the entire population of Belgium is Roman Catholic, there being only about 15,000 Protestants and 3000 Jews. The ministers of each denomination are paid by the state, •—the amount so paid in 1873 being 4,648,757 francs, or £185,950, of which Roman Catholics received 4,568,200 francs, Protestants 69,336, Jews 11,221.

The kingdom is divided into six Roman Catholic dioceses,—the archbishopric of Malines, and the bishoprics of Bruges, Ghent, Liège, Namur, and Tournay. The archbishopric has three vicars-general, and a chapter of twelve canons; and each of the bishoprics, two vicars-general, and a chapter of eight canons. In 1873 there were 156 deaneries, 233 rectories, 2788 chapels of ease, 148 public chapels, and 1745 vicariates.

The temporal affairs of the churches are managed by a vestry-board and a board of wardens. There is an ecclesiastical seminary in each diocese, and scholarships are annually given by the state to certain of the students upon the presentation of the chief of the diocese. The state also contributes to the salaries of the professors by an annual grant to each of the seminaries, except that of Liège which has sufficient funds otherwise. The provinces are bound to provide and maintain suitable buildings for these seminaries. There are a number of religious houses in Belgium for mafes and females, whose lives are spent in pious contemplation, teaching, and visiting the sick. The number of these houses in 1866 was,—for males 178, and for females 8144; the number of persons in the former was 2991, and 15,205 in the latter.

The Protestant Evangelical Church is under a synod, composed of the clergymen of the body and a representative from each of the churches. It sits in Brussels once a year, when each member is required to be present, or to delegate his powers to another member. The Anglican Church has eight pastors and as many chapels iu Belgium, -—three in Brussels and one in each of the towns Antwerp, Bruges, Ghent, Ostend, and Spa.

The Jews have a central synagogue at Brussels, three branch synagogues of the first-class at Antwerp, Ghent, and Liège, and two of the second-class at Arion and Namur. The civil and religious affairs are conducted by a [9:3:518] consistory of nine members, six of whom are appointed by the central, and one by each of three first-class synagogues. The grand rabbi, who is at the head of this body in Belgium, is, ex officio, a member of the consistory.

The Belgian Government has shown itself thoroughly alive to the great importance of a general diflusion of education among the people. Numerous public schools and literary and scientific institutions are established throughout the country, supported out of the communal, provincial, or Government funds. Different classes of inspectors are appointed to visit and report upon the state of education in their various districts. Prizes, scholarships, and other rewards are bestowed upon those that distinguish themselves most in the prosecution of their studies. Religious and moral instruction is under the direction of the sect to which the majority of the pupils belong; bût those connected with other sects may be exempted from attendance on this course. Normal schools have also been established for the purpose of securing trained and efficient teachers. The schools are open to all, and gratuitous instruction is provided for those who may not otherwise have the means of acquiring it. Yet, with all these advantages, there are still many among the lower classes growing up in ignorance. According to the census of 1866, out of a population of 4,827,833, only 2,279,891 were able to read and write, giving, if we exclude all of seven years of age and under, only 58 per cent, of the population. This proportion varied considerably in the different provinces, being as high as 77 in Luxembourg and 71 in Namur, and as low as 48 in East and 51 in West Flanders. In 1843 only 49 per cent, of those who took part in the balloting for the militia were able to read and write; in 1853, 56; in 1863, 62; and in 1873, 74. Out of 42,313 in 1873, 8678 were unable to read or write, 2027 could read but could not write, 13,887 were able to read and write, and 16,836 had received a superior education. This shows that it is not enough merely to provide the means of education in order to secure an educated population. In the industrial localities the parents are generally anxious to get their children admitted as soon as possible into workshops and manufactories, and in rural districts they are engaged in tending cattle or in field labour.

The educational institutions may be divided into four classes, viz., primary, middle, superior, and special.

A law passed in 1842 enacted that there should be at least one primary school in every commune, except in certain cases where primary education is already sufficiently provided for by private schools, or where one school may serve for several neighbouring communes. The communes may also adopt one or more private schools, possessing the legal qualifications, to occupy the place of the communal school. The branches taught are reading, writing, and the elements of arithmetic; the rudiments of the language spoken in the locality,—French, Flemish, or German; moral and religious instruction; and the legal system of weights and measures, in most schools taught practically. In many of the schools gymnastics, music, the elements of drawing, the outlines of history and geography, and the rudiments of the natural sciences, are also taught. The communes are obliged to afford gratuitous instruction to all the children within their bounds whose parents are in poor circumstances or are otherwise unable to educate them. The primary schools are under the surveillance of the communal authorities and Government inspectors; and the imparting of moral and religious instruction is superintended by delegates from the religious bodies. Each province has a general inspector of the primary schools, who is appointed by the king, and inspects, at least once a year, all the communal schools in his district. Under him are the cantonal inspectors, who must visit the schools in their districts at least twice a-year. In 1872 the primary schools submitting to inspection were—communal, 3949; adopted, 469; private, 18; and boarding, 22; besides which there were 990 private schools and 230 boarding schools not under inspection. Of the inspected schools 1353 were for boys, 1284 for girls, and 1821 for both sexes; and of the non-inspected 267 were for boys, 693 for girls, and 261 for both sexes. The total number of primary schools was 5678, giving on an average 2 - 21 schools to each commune, and I 13 to each 1000 of the population. The total number of scholars attending these schools was 618,937 (or 12 - 3 per cent, of the population), of whom 313,165 were boys and 305,772 girls; 518,141 were at inspected schools, and 100,796 at non-inspected. The number of scholars attending the communal schools was 449,940, of whom 325,432 were instructed gratuitously; and attending the adopted schools 63,594, of whom 42,521 were receiving gratuitous instruction. The total number of teachers and assistants was 10,629, of whom 5394 were males and 5235 females; of these, 4656 males and 2977 females were in the communal or adopted schools. The teachers in the communal schools are appointed by the communal councils, which have the power of suspending them for a period not exceeding three months, the Government decreeing as to their absolute dismissal or reinstatement. They are required to have attended, for at least two years, the classes of a normal school.

Besides the primary schools properly so called, there are in many localities other establishments where primary instruction is communicated, as the infant, adult, manufacturing schools, Ac. The infant schools are for children between two and six years of age. There were in 1872, 780 of these schools, of which 212 were communal, 220 private but under inspection, and 348 private and noninspected. The total number of pupils was 78,181.

In the adult schools the branches taught are generally the same as in the communal primary schools. The communal councils are invited to establish such schools, and of late years considerable progress has been made in this direction. In 1863 the number of adult schools was 1194, within all 188,890 scholars; and in 1872, 2351, with 199,957 scholars. In the latter year 1454 of the schools were communal, 74 private inspected, and 823 private non-inspected. Of the scholars 98,558 were males, and 101,399 females; 56,880 were at communal schools, where 54,630 were receiving gratuitous instruction, and 7362 at adopted schools, where 7179 were gratuitously instructed. There are also primary schools annexed to prisons, hospitals, and dépôts of mendicants, and reform schools. The number of these in 1872 was 97, and of scholars 6485. Considerable sums are given by Government for providing food, clothing, and other necessaries for the poor children attending the primary and infant schools.

The expenses of public primary education fall in the first instance on the commune; and in case of insufficiency of funds, the province, and finally the state, come to its assistance. Each commune, however, must contribute a sum equal to at least two per cent, upon its direct taxation before being entitled to claim any assistance from the province or state. The total expenditure for public primary education was,—in 1843, 2,651,639 francs; in 1853, 4,465,411; and in 1863, 9,372,259. In 1872 it was 16,200,843 or £648,033, of which 1,326,659 francs were school fees received, 506,512 public or private donations, 5,863,561 were contributed by the communes, 1,584,010 by the provinces, and 6,643,415 by the state.

The middle schools are divided into two classes, those supported by the Government, and those maintained by the communes. The former are of two kinds—(1), the royal athenaeums, called also the middle superior schools; and (2), the middle inferior schools, or the middle schools properly [9:3:519] eo called, including the former superior primary, as well as the schools formerly known as industrial and commercial schools.

There are ten royal athenaeums, two in Hainault, and one in each of the other provinces, viz., in the towns of Antwerp, Brussels, Bruges, Ghent, Mons, Tournay, Liège, Hasselt, Arion, and Namur. In each of these are two courses, the one for the humanities and the other for a professional education. The professional course is divided into a lower division, comprehending a course of three classes, each of one year, and an upper division, with three sections, the commercial, industrial, and scientific, each divided into two classes, and extending over two years. In 1872 the number of students at the athenaeums was 3562, of whom G23 were in the preparatory classes, 1157 in the humanity section, and 1782 in the professional.

In the state middle schools the courses are arranged so as to occupy three years. To some is annexed a preparatory section, making a year more> The number of these schools in 1872 was 50, with 9012 scholars.

The communal middle schools are of two grades, a first and second,—the former embracing 17 schools, the latter 16. They ought to be based upon the same principles, and teach the same branches as the royal athenaeums and middle schools. In 1872 the number of scholars in the first or higher grade of schools was 1381, of whom 239 were in the preparatory classes, 730 in the humanity section, and 412 in the professional. The number of scholars in the lower grade of schools was 1828, of whom 1274 were in the lower sections and 554 in the higher. Most of these schools have libraries, museums of natural history, and chemical laboratories attached to them. There are in addition to these 75 unendowed colleges, of which 45 are Episcopal and 11 Jesuit.

The educational staff consists of a prefect of studies in the athenaeums, and a rector in the middle schools, professors, regents, and masters. The prefects, professors, rectors, and regents are nominated by the king, and the masters and teachers by the minister of the interior. The diploma of a professor agrégé of either degree is bestowed by a special jury after a searching examination. It is given without regard to the place where the candidate has studied. The prefects and rectors reside on the premises, and have the general direction and management of the institutions over which they are placed. Each has to report annually as to the state and condition of the institution under his care, and to register the conduct and progress of the scholars.

The middle, like the primary schools, are subjected to a regular system of inspection. The literary and scientific branches are under the superintendence of two inspectors and an inspector-general nominated by the king. To one of the inspectors is especially confided the mathematical and natural sciences, and to the other the humanities; the other branches, as history, geography, and the commercial sciences, may be committed to either of the inspectors or to the inspector-general. The inspector has to examine and report upon the state and discipline of each establishment, the methods employed in teaching, the progress made by the pupils, and the merit and zeal of the teachers. The conseil de prefectionnement for the direction and improvement of middle education is composed of from eight to ten members, mostly professors in the universities, presided over by the minister of the interior or his deputy, and meets at least four times a year. A general competition takes place annually among the scholare of the athenaeums and colleges receiving grants from Government, to which, however, scholars from other establishments may be admitted. The examinations are both written and oral; and the rewards are of three kinds, prizes, accessits, and honourable mention.

The amount contributed by the state to the athenaeums in 1872 was 467,575 francs, to the state middle schools 418,589, and to the communal middle schools 184,079 The amount contributed by the communes to the athenaeums was 291,937 francs, to the state middle schools 169,320. and to the communal middle schools 232,359.

The superior instruction establishments are the four universities,—two belonging to the state, at Ghent and Liege, the free university at Brussels, and the Catholic university at Louvain.

Each of the state universities has faculties of philosophy and literature, science, law, and medicine. In each there are 8 professors in philosophy, 9 in the sciences, 7 in law, and 8 in medicine. One or two additional professors may be added to each of the faculties in case of necessity. The professors are nominated by the king, and cannot exercise any other profession without the consent of the Government.

Attached to each university are a number of agrégés named by the king. Their title is honorary, and they are chosen from among those students who have most distinguished themselves at the public competitions or final examinations, from professors of middle instruction, or from members of the civil or military body of engineers. They are nominally attached to one of the faculties, but are not prohibited from exercising any of the liberal pιθfessions, and in case of any of the professors being unable to perform his duties, a substitute is chosen from among the agrégés attached to that faculty.

The universities are under the management of a rector, a secretary, deans of faculty, the senatus academicus, and the board of assessors. The rector is nominated by the king for three years, and has the direction of all academic matters. The secretary is appointed annually by the king from a list of two candidates nominated by the senatus academicus. The deans of the faculties are chosen annually by the professors of each faculty, and have the right of convoking the professors of their faculty. The senatus and the board of assessors are convoked by the rector; the former is composed of the professors, under the presidency of the rector, and the latter of the rector, secretary, and the deans of faculty.

Each student pays annually for enrolment 15 francs, and then takes out a ticket for the branches of the course in which he intends to take his examinations. For philosophy and literature, and for law, the annual ticket costs 250 francs, and 200 francs for the other faculties. The instructions are given in the French language. Subsidies are accorded by Government to the universities for the libraries, botanical gardens, cabinets, <fcc.; but the towns of Liege and Ghent are bound to maintain the buildings. The sum granted by the state to the two universities in 1873 was 937,919 francs.

Attached to the university of Ghent is a school for civil engineers. The preparatory course extends over two years, and comprehends the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences necessary to the subsequent courses. The special course is divided into two sections, the one for engineers of roads and bridges, and the other for architectural engineers. This course continues for two or three years. The third course, which lasts for three years, is for industrial engineers or persons engaged in arts or manufactures. They are instructed in the application of the various sciences to the arts and manufactures, particularly to the mechanical arts.

Similar to the above is the mining school attached to the university of Liège. The first course is preparatory to the other two. The special course includes all the branches necessary to a mining engineer. The third course is for those desirous of obtaining a knowledge of mining, min[9:3:520]erals, &c., more particularly as connected with the arts and manufactures. This last course extends over three years.

The free university of Brussels has faculties of philosophy and literature, of science, of law, and of medicine, courses in which are given by ordinary and extraordinary professors and agrégés. Each student pays annually 15 francs for enrolment, and a fee of 200 or 250 francs for the courses in any of the faculties. The fee for single classes is generally 50 francs. An annual subsidy of 10,000 francs is allocated to the uuiversity by the provincial council of Brabant, and the permanent deputation has the right of annually presenting ten youths of the province for gratuitous instruction. A subsidy of 50,000 francs is also allocated annually by the communal council of Brussels. The university is governed by an administrative council, composed partly of permanent members and partly of members chosen annually by the professors of the four faculties and the former students of the university. This council is presided over by the burgomaster of Brussels, who has a casting vote in its proceedings.

The Catholic university of Louvain 13 governed by a grand rector, nominated and revocable by the episcopal body. A vice rector is also nominated by the episcopal body on the advice of the grand rector. The rector nominates the secretary and other functionaries of the university. The faculties are philosophy and literature, the mathematical, physical, and natural sciences, law, medicine, and theology. The courses of the five faculties are given by ordinary and extraordinary professors and lecturers, nominated by the episcopal body on the presentation of the rector. The enrolment-fee for the first year is 10 francs, and 5 francs annually thereafter. The annual fee for courses in the faculties varies from 200 to 250 francs, except the theological courses, which are gratuitous. It has an extensive library, cabinets of mineralogy, zoology, <fcc., and a botanical garden. The numbers of the students at each of the universities in 1874 were—Ghent, 222; Liège, 518; Brussels, 580; and Louvain, 909.

A competition takes place annually among the scholars of superior instruction, and at these competitions two gold medals are given in each of the faculties. There are also twelve travelling scholarships given annually, tenable for two years, to such students as have taken their doctor’s degree with the highest distinction and wish to travel, to enable them to visit foreign countries; and about sixty bursaries of 400 francs each are given annually to poor students to enable them to prosecute their studies. Besides these there are connected with the universities a number of private bursaries, the management and bestowal of which are in the hands of particular persons or corporations in terms of the acts of foundation.

The special educational institutions of Belgium are of various kinds, and are generally in a very efficient state. They include (in addition to the engineering and mining schools already mentioned) normal schools, military schools, navigation schools, <fcc., and academies and schools of design, painting, sculpture, music, &c.

There are two Government normal schools for primary teachers, one at Lierre and the other at Nivelles.—the former having twelve and the latter thirteen professors, with a rector each. The course extends over three years, and during the last year of attendance the pupils are exercised in teaching in the primary schools of the town. There are also seven episcopal normal schools, in which similar branches are taught, except that the principles of the Catholic religion are more particularly inculcated. The chief diocesan nominates the rectors and professors. The course lasts for four years. Besides these there are several private normal schools for males and females, one or more institutions for the training of female teachers by each province, and normal primary sections attached to the middle schools of Bruges, Ghent, Huy, Virton, and Couvin.

Bursaries of 200 francs each are annually given by Government to assist poor students attending the normal schools; and students of promise, who have taken diplomas at either of the Government primary normal schools, may be admitted to the normal school of middle instruction at Nivelles. The course here is for two years. There are also for the training of teachers for the superior middle institutions, the normal school of the humanities at Liège, and the normal school of the sciences at Ghent. Candidates for admission must be young men of superior talents, qualifying them to perform creditably the duties of professor, and they must pass certain examinations. The branches taught in both schools extend over three years. In the school at Liège there are fourteen bursaries of 500 francs each, given to the poorer students, the recipients becoming bound to act as professors in one of the middle schools for five years. There are five bursaries of 500 francs in connection with the school at Ghent.

There is a military school at Brussels for training officers for the army. The number of scholars in 1873 was 129. The courses are divided into two sections; the one, which extends over two years, is preparatory to the second, which also extends over two years, and is divided into special branches qualifying for the infantry, cavalry, or marines. A school has been established in Lierre for the purpose of educating the sons of the military for the army. The course extends over five years, and the pupils generally enter the army about the age of sixteen. They are placed in the army according to their proficiency, some as sub-officers and corporals, others as common soldiers. The pupils io 1873 were 252.

Each regiment has a regimental school for training young men in the army for subalterns, and a number of evening schools for affording the means of education to the soldiery. Attendance at one of these schools is obligatory on all subalterns and corporals whose education is not complete, according to their position.

There is at Messines a Royal Institution for the education of daughters of military men who have died or been disabled in the service of their country. They are admitted from seven to fourteen years of age, and remain till their eighteenth year. They are instructed in branches necessary to qualify them as governesses, teachers, domestic servants, <fcc., and situations are provided for them on leaving.

Schools of navigation have been established at Antwerp and Ostend for furnishing properly educated masters for merchant vessels, where instruction is given gratuitously. Certificates of qualifications as master or mate are given by a jury of examiners. There has also recently been formed at Antwerp a superior institute of commerce to afford instruction, theoretical and practical, in the commercial sciences, the course extending over two years.

A Government agricultural institute was established at Gembloux in 1860 for affording theoretical and practical instruction in agriculture and kindred subjects. There are seven professors and three assistants, and a demonstrative gardener. The course lasts for three years. Students in 1873, 71. There is a similar institution at Ghent, which in 1873 had 31 students. A school of practical horticulture and arboriculture was established at Vilvorde in 1855, which in 1873 had 29 students; the course is for three years. A similar institution at Gend-brugg has been closed since 1871. There is also a veterinary college at Brussels with, in 1873, 84 students. The course is for four years.

The academies and schools of design, painting, sculpture, &c., are divided into three classes :—1. The royal academies of the fine arts, in which painting, sculpture, architecture.
[9:3:521]

and engraving are taught in the most efficient manner; 2. Academies of design established in the principal towns, and giving instructions in designing, architecture, and the principles of geometry and perspective drawing ; 3. Schools of design established in all the larger towns for instructing young persons and artisans in the elements of designing and architecture. In 1873 there were 76 such academies and schools in the kingdom, having 9966 pupils.

The Royal Academy of the Fine Arts at Antwerp is principally intended to afford gratuitous instruction in painting, sculpture, architecture, and engraving, and to propagate and encourage a taste for the fine arts. In 1873 there were 1666 scholars. A competition in one of the branches of the fine arts is annually held in Antwerp, the laureate at which receives a pension of 3500 francs annually for four years, to enable him to perfect himself in his art in Germany, France, and Italy. The second prize is a gold medal of 300 francs. The Royal Academy of the Fine Arts at Brussels is an institution similar to that at Antwerp. Instruction is gratuitous, and the vacancies are filled up by competition.

The Royal Musical Conservatory at Brussels is under the direction of the minister of the interior, aided by a commission of seven members nominated by the king, with the burgomaster of Brussels as honorary president. The instruction is gratuitous, and includes vocal and instrumental music, composition, and the Italian language. The number of scholars in 1873 was 529. There are six bursaries of 250 francs, and ten of 125 francs, in connection with this institution. There is a similar establishment at Liège, with (in 1873) 694 scholars. Music, both vocal and instrumental, is much cultivated in Belgium; and musical schools and societies are established in almost all the principal towns and throughout the country. In 1873 there were, besides those mentioned, 108 musical schools and societies, with 7440 members. A competition in musical composition takes place every two years at Brussels, the laureate receiving a pension of 3500 francs for four years, to enable him to study in France, Germany, and Italy. The second prize is a gold medal of the value of 300 francs.

Belgium possesses a great number of learned societies, as the Royal Medical Academy, the Royal Academy of Science, Literature, and Art, &c. The Royal Medical Academy has its seat at Brussels. It is divided into six sections, and has 36 titular and 18 assistant members, with 24 corresponding and an indefinite number of honorary members. Each of the sections has certain branches of medical science assigned to it. The academy answers any questions that may be proposed to it by the Government, upon matters connected with public hygiene, and makes researches in all subjects connected with or tending to advance medical science. Gold medals are given annually for the best essays on prescribed subjects. It receives an annual grant of 20,000 francs from the state.

The Royal Academy of Science, Literature, and Art also has its seat at Brussels. It is divided into three classes, for the sciences, literature, and the fine arts; the first two are each subdivided into two sections, and the last into branches, for painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture, and music. Each class is composed of 30 members, 50 foreign associates, and not more than ten native correspondents. Each class proposes annually certain subjects for essays, to which gold medals of the value of 600 francs are adjudged. The academy receives an annual grant of 40,000 francs from the state. Connected with this academy is a royal commission of history for the purpose of searching for and editing old chronicles and documents tending to throw light upon the early history of the country. There has also just (1875) been instituted by the king a prize of 25,000 francs (£1000) to be given annually for the best work published on a subject previously announced of interest to Belgium. Every fourth year the a competition is to be open to foreigners.

There is a Government inspector-general of science, literature, and art, who has the general superintendence of that department, under the minister of the interior. Under him are two administrative boards, the one for literature and science, and the other for the fine arts.

The Royal Observatory for astronomical and meteorological observations is under the management of a director and three assistants. In the observatory are instruments specially provided by Government for the use of young men desirous of_ making meteorological or astronomical observations.

The Royal Museum of Brussels, for the reception of objects in natural history belonging to the state, is under the direction of a council of five members appointed by the king. There is also a museum of industry, containing models and plans of machines used in arts, manufactures, and agriculture. Annexed to this museum is a school where instruction is given gratuitously in the construction of such machines. It possesses a chemical laboratory, library, <fcc. There is also a royal museum of war instruments at Brussels, and in 1870 a royal botanic garden was laid out for aiding in the study of botany and horticulture. The royal museum of painting and sculpture is under the direction of a commission, composed of a president and six members nominated by the king, and charged with the collection of works of ancient and modern masters for the museum. A triennial exhibition of works of living artists, Belgian and foreign, in painting, sculpture, engraving, architecture, and lithography, is held at Brussels. There are similar exhibitions held in Antwerp, Ghent, Liège, Bruges, &c. The geographical establishment at Brussels has a considerable collection of books and maps, a garden, a herbarium, collections of rocks, lava, fossils, &c.

Besides the libraries belonging to different societies, associations, <tc., there are a number of public libraries in Belgium. The principal of these is the royal library of Brussels. It contained in 1871 about 301,500 volumes, 22,221 manuscripts, 53,556 engravings, and 19,517 medals and coins. This is the only library that receives copies of copyright works. The public library of Ghent is connected with the university. It has 80,000 volumes and 600 manuscripts, besides pamphlets, <fcc. The Liège public library has 68,000 volumes, about 26,000 pamphlets, and 430 . manuscripts. The public library of the Louvain university is the most ancient in Belgium, and is particularly rich in works of ancient history, theology, and literature, including Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Oriental. These libraries are open daily for consultation, and in almost all of them volumes are lent out at the discretion of the conservators.

The archives of Belgium contain a great number of interesting and valuable documents connected with the history of the country. These are carefully preserved, classified, and catalogued. The general archives of the kingdom at Brussels contain upwards of 100,000 documents, and the archives of Antwerp upwards of 70,000. Those at Bruges, Ghent, Liège, Mons, Namur, Tournay, Hasselt, and Arion are ancient and important. The archives of the city of Bruges, at one time the grand commercial entrepôt of Europe, contain a number of valuable papers bearing upon the events of which this city was the theatre in the Middle Ages. Unfortunately, they do not go further back than 1280, the previous documents having been all destroyed by an extensive fire in that year.

The benevolent and charitable institutions of Belgium are numerous and open to all. The duty of supporting [9:3:522] them falls in the first instance upon the commune, afterwards upon the province, and finally, in case of necessity, upon the state. They are divided into three classes :—(1.) Those affording assistance or an asylum to the poor in case of age, infirmity, disease, want of work, <fcc., including dispensaries, foundling and maternity hospitals, deaf-mute and blind institutions, &c.; (2.) Those more particularly designed for the prevention and suppression of vagabondage and beggary, as dépôts of mendicity and reform schools; and (3.) Those specially intended to foster a spirit of independence and foresight among the working classes, as savings-banks, and assurance and mutual assistance societies.

Every town of importance and many of the rural communes have hospitals for tbe aged, infirm, and indigent. Asylums for incurables are also numerous, but much less so than the former. Farm hospitals have been established in the rural communes of the two Flanders, where the inmates contribute by work to their own maintenance. They form small agricultural colonies of old people and children, mutually assisting each other. The products of the farms generally suffice for their maintenance.

Foundling hospitals are established in Antwerp, Brussels, Louvain, Bruges, Ostend, &c. The children generally remain only for a short time in the hospitals. They are pensioned out to inhabitants of the rural communes till their twelfth year, at which period the wardship of the hospital terminates. Inspectors are appointed to visit the children quarterly, to report upon their physical condition, see that they are attending school, &c. There are maternity hospitals at Brussels, Louvain, Ghent, Liège, Bruges, Nieuport, an.l Toumay, in several of which courses of midwifery are given. Maternity societies for aiding females with money, medicine, &c., are formed in many of 'the towns. There are a number of lunatic asylums, which in 1873 had in all 6801 patients, of whom 5024 were paupers. A colony of lunatics has been formed in the commune of Gheel, province of Antwerp, where, under the direction of a permanent committee, they are pensioned out among the inhabitants, and generally employed in agricultural labours. There are also a number of institutions for the education of the deaf and dumb and the blind.

To prevent the misery, and frequently the crime, arising from the want of employment among the working classes, charity workshops have been established in Ghent, Liège, and other towns. These are accessible to all workmen without employment and in poor circumstances. The able-bodied are paid according to their work, and the aged and infirm according to their necessities. The workshops of apprenticeship and improvement are intended not only to supply work to the unemployed, but principally to initiate the people in the exercise of new or improved branches of industry, and to instruct the young men in some trade or profession by which they may be able to gain an honest livelihood. They have been found of great benefit to many of the poorer classes who would otherwise have been brought up as vagrants and beggars. The apprenticeship generally lasts from four to six months. Similar to these are the manufacturing schools, intended principally for girls, where they are employed in the manufacture of lace, &c. These are supported partly by the state and partly by the province and commune, but many of them are private. In 1872 there were of these institutions—29 communal, 144 private but subject to inspection, and 294 non-inspected. The total number of persons was 26,739, of whom 1067 were in communal establishments, 9649 private inspected, and 16,023 non-inspected; 25,565 were females and 1174 males.

There are three dépote of mendicity or workhouses in the kingdom, at Bruges, Hoogstraeten, and Reckheim. In 1873 they contained 1819 persons. A reform school was founded in Ruysselede in 1848 for male vagrants and mendicants under eighteen years of age. It contains about 500 members, employed in cultivating a large farm of 128 hectares. At a short distance is a similar institution for 400 girls and infants, between two and seven years of age. There is also a similar school for girls and infants at Beernem.

In each commune is a bureau de bienfaisance, for assisting the poor with money, food, clothing, &c., and, where there are no hospitals, providing them with medical attendance and medicines. It also contributes to the maintenance and education of poor children, foundlings, deaf-mutes, and lunatics. There are also Λfonts de Piété, or charitable institutions for lending money to the poor upon the security of pledges, in twenty of the larger towns. Caisses de prévoyance, both general and special, and mutual aid societies—to succour the members in sickness, pay their funeral expenses, and aid their families—are numerous.

The judicial system of Belgium consists of courts and tribunals of various kinds, as the court of cassation, the courts of appeal, and of assize, tribunals of primary instance, of commerce, <fcc. The court of cassation or annulment sits at Brussels, and is divided into two chambers, the one for civil and the other for criminal matters. It is composed of a president-general, a president of the chamber, and fifteen councillors. It decides upon appeals against judgments pronounced in the other courts and tribunals in contravention of legal forms. There are three courts of appeal: one at Brussels, for the provinces of Antwerp, Brabant, and Hainault; another at Ghent, for the two Flanders; and a third at Liège, for Liège, Limbourg, Luxembourg, and Namur. In the capital of each province is a court of assize, composed of a councillor, deputed from one of the courts of appeal, who presides, and two judges chosen from among the presidents and judges of the primary tribunal, where the court is held. Crimes, graver misdemeanours, political offences, and abuses of the press are judged by the courts of assize. In each judiciary arrondissement is a tribunal of primary instance, judging in misdemeanours belonging to the correctional police, in civil matters, and in commercial affairs where there is no commercial tribunal. The number of judges varies from three to ten in each tribunal. Tribunals of commerce are established by law in several principal towns. They judge definitively in civil matters of not more than 2000 francs, but above that sum their decisions are subject to appeal, as in the tribunals of primary instance. In several of the manufacturing towns are councils of prud ’ hommes, composed of master tradesmen and workmen. They decide in all questions and disputes arising between masters and workmen. For all criminal and political cases, as well as offences of the press, trial by jury is established. The jury is composed of twelve persons chosen by lot from a leet of thirty. Justices of the peace and judges of the tribunals are chosen directly by the king. The councillors of each court of appeal, and the presidents and vice-presidents of the tribunals of primary instance in its district, are chosen by the king from two double lists of candidates, the one presented by the court of appeal, and the other by the provincial council. The councillors of the court of cassation are named by the king from two double lists, the one presented by the senate, and the other by the court of cassation. The judges are appointed for life, and cannot be suspended or deposed but by a judgment. They cannot hold any salaried office under the Government, or, at least, must perform the duties of it gratuitously. The duties of public minister at the court of cassation are exercised by a procurator-general, and two advocates [9:3:523] general; and by a royal procurator with substitutes before each of the tribunals of primary instance and courts of assize and appeal.

Councils of war are held in the chief place of each province, with the exception of Limbourg, which is joined to Liège, and of Luxembourg, which is united with Namur. They decide in crimes and misdemeanours committed in their provinces by the military of a rank not higher than eaptain. The military court for the whole of Belgium has its seat at Brussels. It is composed of five members, one of whom is a councillor of the appeal court of Brussels, delegated annually to preside; the rest are general or superior officers chosen by lot every month. All officers of a grade superior to that of captain are amenable to this court. It also decides on appeals from the provincial or other military courts.

Besides the ordinary police, there are commissaries of police, royal procurators, j 'uges d’instruction, &c. The commissaries of police, and in the communes where these are wanting the burgomasters or delegated aidermen, are specially charged with searching out and proving all contraventions of the police laws. The royal procurators are charged with discovering and prosecuting for all offences coming within the jurisdiction of the courts of assize or the correctional tribunals of police. There is at least one juge d’instruction, or examining judge, in each arrondissement who is specially charged with the collection of evidence, and with bringing the culprit before the tribunal. There is a council chamber composed of at least three judges, including the juge d’instruction, for the preliminary examination of culprits.

The prisons are of three kinds—(1), central prisons; (2), houses of surety; and (3), houses of arrest. The central prisons are—(1), the central penitentiary at Ghent for different classes of criminals; (2), the penitentiary at Louvain, on the solitary system, for prisoners condemned to more than one year’s imprisonment, except those condemned to imprisonment for life; (3), the penitentiary and reformatory for young criminals at Namur; (4), the penitentiary and reformatory at St Hubert for young delinquents belonging to the rural population, acquitted but put at the disposal of Government; (δ), the branch penitentiary and reformatory at Namur for young criminals and young delinquents, acquitted, belonging to the town populations. The number in the prisons in 1873 was 1568, in the reformatories 751. The houses of surety are established in the capital of each province, where there is a court of assize, and the houses of arrest are in the capital of each arrondissement, the seat of a court of primary instance, where there is not already a house of surety. In these houses are confined the prisoners whose term does not exceed six months if the prison is a common one, and three years if on the solitary system. The number of prisoners in these prisons in 1873 was 2437. In connection with many of these, schools, workshops, and circulating libraries have been established. The prisoners are employed in various kinds of work. Those condemned to compulsory labour receive no remuneration, but those condemned to solitary or correctional imprisonment receive a part of the produce of their labour, which in the case of the latter is frequently applied in mitigation of their punishment. Premiums are also given for good conduct, zeal, and progress in their labours.

Since 1830 the agricultural state of the country has been much improved. A superior council of agriculture is specially charged with the promotion and superintendence of the agricultural interests of the country; and in each of the provinces a commission of practical men is nominated to encourage the introduction of improvements in the different branches of agriculture and report annually upon the state of agriculture in their provinces. Every five years a grand agricultural exhibition of horses, cattle, agricultural implements, and produce is held in Brussels, at which a number of gold and silver medals, <tc', are given as prizes. Local exhibitions are also held frequently in the various districts.

The agriculturists above twelve years of age, including female servants, form one-fourth of the entire population. Females are extensively engaged in agricultural work, being to the males as 61 to 100. In 1866 the number of horses was 283,163; of cattle, 1,242,445; sheep, 586,097; swine, 632,301. To improve the breeds of horses a Government stud of stallions is maintained at Tervueren.

The cultivated land of Belgium amounts to 2,663,753 hectares, or 6,582,123 acres, of which 1,339,795 hectares are in the hands of the proprietors, and 1,323,958 are let to tenants. In West Flanders four-fifths are in the hands of tenants; in Luxembourg nearly five-sixths are in the hands of the proprietors; and in most of the other provinces about one-half is let to tenants. The land is divided into numerous and mostly small patches (nearly 600,000). Of these 43 per cent do not exceed 50 ares; there are 12 per cent, not exceeding one hectare, or 2⅜ acres, 29 per cent, not exceeding 5 hectares, 7⅜ per cent, not exceeding 10 hectares, and less than 8 per cent, of greater extent. The Belgians, particularly in Flanders, are averse to the introduction of improvements in their agricultural operations, and their implements are generally rude and clumsy. Their lands are, however, cultivated with great care and are very productive. Of the cereal crops rye is the most extensively cultivated, and forms an important article of food for the working classes. Wheat and oats are also extensively cultivated, the former particularly in the provinces of Haim, nit, Brabant, and West Flanders. Comparatively little barley is raised. Hops, chicory, tobacco, rape and other oleaginous plants, hemp, flax, madder, beet, <kc., are common. Of these the most extensively cultivated is flax, principally in the two Flanders. Tobacco was much more extensively grown a few years ago than at present; it is now almost entirely confined to the two Flanders and Hainault. The chicory plant is principally raised in Hainault. The cultivation of beet for the extraction of sugar is continually increasing, and numerous establishments have been formed for its preparation. The leguminous plants, pease, beans, and tares, are used principally as fodder for cattle; the most common are beans. The beet root is even more extensively cultivated as fodder than as an industrial plant, particularly in the provinces of West Flanders, Liège, Hainault, and Brabant. Potatoes are largely grown in all the provinces; and, next to potatoes, turnips are the most extensively cultivated of the alimentary r∙oots. The fallow ground, formerly considerable, is now only of small extent, being principally sown in fodder crops. Clover is the principal fodder crop. The number of hectares occupied with the principal crops in 1866 were—wheat, 283,542; oats, 221,743; rye, 288,966; barley, 43,617; beans, 24,263; pease, tares, ∙fcc,, 13,645; potatoes, 171,397; flax, 57,045; colza, 26,412; beetrootfor sugar, 18,074; turnips, carrots, &c., 28,806; hemp, hops, chicory, tobacco, <fcc., 13,775. Vegetable gardens occupied 37,329; meadow, 365,805; fallow, 53,891.

Belgium is rich in various kinds of minerals, as coal iron, calamine, <fcc., which form a valuable source of employ ment to many thousands of its inhabitants.

The coal may be divided into two great basins. The western basin is the most important, and has an estimated extent of 90,051 hectares (or about 222,400 acres),— 75,725 in the province of Hainault, and 14,326 in Namur. The extent of the eastern bed is estimated at 44,062 hectares,—41,745 in the province of Liège, and 2317 '.n [9:3:524] Namur. All varieties, from anthracite to the richest gascoal, are found. In 1873 there were 285 coal-mines in the country, employing 107,902 persons, and producing 15,778,401 tons of coal valued at 337,637,360 francs. The iron districts are the arrondissement of Charleroi, and the provinces of Namur, Liege, and Luxembourg. Besides the iron-mines in Charleroi, Hainault contains a coppermine, commenced in 1849, and calamine and blende mines. Iron is also found in small quantities in the arrondissements, of Mons and Tournay. In Namur the iron ore is rich and plentiful, and constitutes the principal mineral wealth of the province. Veins of lead and zinc are also wrought to a considerable extent. The iron-mines of Luxembourg are much inferior to those of Namur. The principal are those of Durbuy, Ruette, Grandcourt, Halanzy, and Musson. The ferruginous basins of Theux and La Reid are of the greatest importance, both as public works, and from the quantity of ore that they furnish. Lead and zinc are found here almost always in the same bed. Alumiferous schist is common in several parts of the province. In 1873 the different metallic mines yielded 13,952 tons of blende, 28,630 of calamine, 11,280 of lead, 36,651 of pyrites, and 503,563 of buddled iron ore. The number of workmen employed in these mines was 3758. Under the minister of the interior the mines are superintended by a corps of mining engineers; each of the six mining districts has an ordinary engineer, and each of the two divisions a chief engineer. A sub-engineer is appointed over a certain number of mines.

Marble is abundant in many parts of Belgium; and the black marbles, as those of Dinant and Gochene, may rival the finest productions of other countries. There are also numerous quarries of freestone, granite, limestone, slate, &c. The principal quarrying provinces are Namur and Hainault. In 1873 there were 2230 quarries in the country, employing 22,435 men, and yielding the value of 38,353,171 francs.

The number of works in 1873 for the preparation of iron was 331; steel, 3; lead, 7; copper, 6; zinc, 1; alum 1; glass, 72; and 41,845 workmen were engaged. The value of the iron manufactures was upwards of 246,000,000 francs; glass, 46,000,000; zinc, 38,000,000; steel, 7,700,000; copper, 6,000,000; lead, 4,700,000, &c.

1 Notwithstanding many vicissitudes, flax, the most ancient, still forms one of the most important branches of industry in the country. In 1866, 57,045 hectares of land were occupied in the cultivation of flax, and a considerable number in hemp. The declared value of flax and hemp yarn imported in 1872 was 10,427,000 francs; of flax yarn exported, 80,904,000; of hemp, 7,155,000; and of flax and hemp cloths, 37,170,000.

Cotton also forms an important branch of industry, which is at present in a more flourishing condition than at any former period. In 1872 the value imported of raw cotton was 57,241,000 francs; cotton yarn, 5,214,000; and cotton cloths, 12,754,000; the value exported of cotton yarn, 6,358,000; cotton cloths, 19,083,000.

The manufacture of woollens forms also as important branch of industry. The wool for this purpose is principally imported from Prussia, Saxony, <fcc., the native produce being small in quantity and chiefly used in hosiery. In 1872 the value of the wools imported was 160,079,000 francs; yarn, 6,902,000; manufactured stuffs, 23,814,000; exported wool, 10,291,000; yarn, 64,523,000; manufactured stuffs, 44,850,000.

In 1866 the numbers employed in the various flax,hemp, woollen, and cotton manufactures, were 114,547 males and 71,111 females. The chief of the other manufactures are silk, lace, ribbons, beer, spirits, vinegar, sugar, salt, bricks and tiles, porcelain, earthenware, glass, crystal, paper, leather, ropes, <fcc. In 1872 the excise duties on beer and vinegar amounted to 15,547,605 francs; spirits, 16,946,225; foreign wines, 4,765,800; and sugar, 7,516,388.

In 1850, 2165 sailing and steam vessels, of 314,797 tons, entered Belgium; in 1860, 3780 vessels of 667,287 tons; in 1870, 5658 vessels, of 1,575,293 tons; and in 1872, 6134 vessels, of 1,878,106 tons. Of the last 3082 were steam vessels, of 1,158,484 tons. In 1850 the number of vessels that left Belgium was 2214<, tonnage 235,745; in 1860, 3959, tonnage 694,225; in 1870, 5406, tonnage 1,534,513; and in 1872, 6241, tonnage 1,907,530. Of the last 3081 vessels, with 1,169,254 tons, were steamers. The numbers and tonnage of vessels entering from and leaving for different countries in 1872 were as follows :—

Expressed in millions of francs the value of the imports in 1850 was 236; of the exports, 263; of goods in transit, 206: in 1860—imports, 516; exports, 469; in transit, 408: in 1870—imports, 520; exports, 690; in transit, 857: and in 1872—imports, 1277; exports, 1051; in transit, 1049. Of the imports in 1872, 315 were from France, 230 from England, 164 from Holland, 158 from the German Zollverein, 80 from the United States, 77 from the Argen tine Republic, 62 from Russia, 35 from Uruguay, 24 from Brazil, and 23 from Sweden and Norway. Of the exports 320 were to France, 237 to England, 223 to the German Zollverein, 120 to Holland, 18 to Switzerland, 17 to the Hanseatic towns, 14 to the United States, 12 to Italy, and 11 to Russia. Of the goods in transit 434 were from the German Zollverein, 32] from France, 96 from England, and 92 from Holland; 341 were to the German Zollverein, 245 to England, 237 to France, and 121 to Holland. The values of the principal articles of merchandise imported for home consumption expressed in millions of francs were—wool, 160; grain of all kinds, 126; raw hides, 71; iron ore and cast and wrought iron, 61; cotton, 57; resins, 48; minerals and metals, 47; coffee, 42; wood for building, 41; grease and tallow, 37; silks, 30; horned cattle, 29; oleaginous seeds, 29; woollen stuffs, 23; fermented liquors, 21; oils, 17; machinery, 10. The values of the principal exports were—coal, 85; flax, 80; wrought iron, 69; woollen yarn, 64; raw hides, 53; woollen stuffs, 44; raw sugar, 41; machinery, 39; flax and hemp stuffs, 37; grain of all kinds, 37; flax and hemp yarn, 31; grease and tallow, 25; paper, 21; resins, 21; un wrought zinc, 21; coke, 20; cotton stuffs, 18; glass and crystal wares, 17; wool, 16; candles, 15; butter, 14; arms, 13. The values of the principal goods in transit were—flax and hemp stuffs, 204; wool, 147; woollen stuffs, 102; haberdashery and hardware, 39; silks, 38; cast and wrought iron, 35; cotton, 33; grain of all kinds, 30; coffee, 23; woollen yarn, 20; flax and hemp yarn, 19; cattle, sheep, swine, 18; cotton stuffs, 17; fermented liquors, 16; glass and crystal wares, 16; machines, 13. In 1872 the exports from Belgium to the United Kingdom were £13,211,044, and the imports from the United Kingdom to Belgium £6,499,062.

There are twenty-three chambers of commerce and manufacture established in the principal towns, the members of which are nominated by the king from a triple list o.
[9:3:525]

candidates presented to him by the chambers. The members of each vary in number from nine to twenty-one, one-third going out annually. They present to the Government or legislative chambers their views as to the best means of increasing the commercial and industrial prosperity of the country, report annually upon the state of their districts, and give useful information or direction to the provincial or civic authorities under their administration. There is a superior council of industry and commerce, composed of two delegates chosen annually by each of the chambers of commerce of Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent, Liege, Mons, and Charleroi, one elected by each of the other chambers of commerce, and a certain number of members chosen by the king, not exceeding a third of the others. The president and two vice-presidents are nominated by the king for each session. The council considers matters affecting commerce and industry, and such questions connected therewith as may be submitted to it by the Government.

Belgium possesses a great number of commercial and financial associations, joint-stock companies for carrying on public works or other enterprises, assurance companies, private banking companies, railway companies, &c. It has eight commercial exchanges, under the direction of Government, namely, in Antwerp, Brussels, Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, Mons, Termonde, and Louvain. In 1822 the General Society for the Encouragement of National Industry was formed at Brussels, under a royal charter for 27 years, which has since been extended to 1875 and 1905. It has a social capital of 15,500,000 florins, divided into shares of 500 florins each, bearing interest at 5 per cent. The administrative body consists of a governor, six directors, a secretary, and a treasurer. It discounts bills, receives money at interest, grants loans and advances on titles and other deposits, &c. The National Bank, instituted by charter granted in 1850 and renewed 1872, has its seat at Brussels, and has branches in all the provincial capitals and several other towns. Its capital is 50,000,000 francs, in shares of 1000 francs each. It pays a dividend of 5 per cent, upon the shares, and one-third at least of the profits exceeding 6 per cent, goes to form a sinking fund. The administration consists of a governor nominated by the king, six directors, and a council of censors. The banking operations are superintended by a Government commissary; and a report upon its state is presented to the Government every month. The state funds are deposited in this bank. The Bank of Belgium, chartered in 1835, has a capital of 50,000,000 francs. Its seat is at Brussels. The Bank of Flanders, established in Ghent, has a capital of 10,000,000 francs.

After England, there is no country in Europe where, in proportion to its extent, the roads are more numerous or better kept than in Belgium. They are of three kinds,— those maintained by the state, and those by the provinces and communes. The total length of the two latter cannot be given with accuracy; that of the first is 1187 leagues.

A bill was passed in 1834 authorizing the establishment of a system of railroads, of which Malines was to form the centre, and the line from Brussels to Malines, opened May 5, 1835, was the first railway in operation on the Continent. The Government railways are wrought on account of the Government, and are under special administration. The total length of the various lines of railway in operation in 1873 was 616 leagues (of 5000 metres), of which 125 leagues belonged to the state, and 543 were conceded to others; of the former 117 leagues were double lines. The amount expended by Government in the construction of railways to the end of 1873 was 361.287,299 francs, or £14,451,491.

In 1849 a system of postage was introduced into Belgium similar to that in this country. In 1873 the total number of letters that passed through the post-office was 55,654,859; newspapers, 52,771,524; and packets of printed matter, 25,697,33. In 1860 the numbers were—letters, 23,960,846; newspapers, 26,358,020; and book parcels, 6,668,452.

The first electric telegraph, which was that between Brussels and Antwerp, was introduced into the country in 1846 by an English company. A law passed in 1850 authorized the Government to purchase this, as also to establish telegraphs on all the lines of railway. The telegrams sent out in 1873 were 1,739,817 to different parts of the country, and 676,393 to other countries, besides 153,330 in transit.

The following table shows the annual income and expenditure for various years :—

The details of the revenue and expenditure of the last three of these years, arranged under their several heads, are as follows :—
[table]

The public debt of Belgium at the end of 1873 amounted to 966,920,513 francs or £38,676,820. Except the share of the old debt of the Netherlands which fell to it, most of the national debt has been incurred in the construction of railways and other works of public utility.

In the time of the Romans this portion of the Netherlands was included in Gaul, and formed part of that division of it which was known as Gallia Belgica. It was inhabited mostly by Celtic tribes, but there were also not a few of German race. The latter were subsequently largely [9:3:526] increased by irruptions from the north, so that in the 5th and 6th centuries, under the rule of the Franks, they formed the principal element of the population. For several centuries the history of the Franks is the history of the Netherlands. Afterwards the country was divided into a number of independent duchies, counties, and free cities. Among these may be mentioned the duchies of Brabant, Limbourg, and Luxembourg, the counties of Flanders, Hainault, and Namur, the bishopric of Liège, the lordship of Malines, àc. Of these the county of Flanders rose to be superior to all the others, and became distinguished for its industry and commercial activity. In 1385 the male line of the counts of Flanders became extinct, and their possessions passed into the hands of the dukes of Burgundy, who soon after, in various ways, came into possession of the whole of the Netherlands. In order to strengthen their power they sought to repress the spirit of liberty, and to do away with the free institutions that had sprung up in the country; but notwithstanding this the people continued to increase in wealth and prosperity, and industry and commerce flourished more and more among them. In 1477 Mary of Burgundy, only daughter and heiress of Charles the Bold, married the Archduke Maximilian, son of the Emperor Frederick IV., and thus the Netherlands came into the possession of the House of Austria. Maximilian succeeded to the imperial throne in 1493, and the following year he resigned the government of the Netherlands to his son Philip, then a youth of seventeen years of age. The latter, in 1496, married Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of Castile, and died in 1506, leaving to succeed him a son who afterwards became Charles V. During the reign of this monarch the Protestant religion began to spread in the country, though its adherents were subjected to much persecution. His son and successor, Philip II. of Spain, by his cruel persecutions and his attempt to establish the Inquisition in the country, drove the people into open rebellion. The duke of Alva, who was sent at the head of a Spanish army to reduce them to subjection, perpetrated upon them the most horrid cruelties, devastating the country in every direction, and erecting scaffolds in every city. At length the northern portion of the Netherlands succeeded in establishing its independence, and became the republic of the Seven United Provinces, while the southern portion, or Belgium, continued under the rule of Spain. In 1598 Philip ceded Belgium to .his daughter Isabella and her husband the Archduke Albert, under whom it formed a distinct and independent kingdom. Attempts were then made to restore the prosperity of the country and improve its internal condition; but, unfortunately, Albert died without leaving issue in 1621, and the country again fell into the hands of Spain.

For many years Belgium continued to share in the declining fortunes of Spain; and in the wars that broke out between that power and France and Holland, it was exposed to the first attack, and peace was usually purchased at the expense of some part of its territory. By the treaty of. the Pyrenees (1659) the county of Artois, Thionville, and other districts were ceded to France. Subsequent French conquests, confirmed by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668), took away Lille, Charleroi, Oudenarde, Courtray, and other places. These were, indeed, partly restored to Belgium by the peace of Nimeguen (1679); but, on the other hand, it lost Valenciennes, Nieuport, Cambray, St Omer, Ypres, and Charlemont, which were only in part recovered by the peace of Ryswick (1697). After the conclusion of this last treaty the Spanish Government attempted to restore prosperity to Belgium by the introduction of new customs laws, and by other means, particularly by the construction of canals to counteract the injury done to its commerce by the closing of the navigation of the Scheldt by the Dutch. But these attempts were of little avail in consequence of the breaking out of the War of the Spanish Succession, which was only brought to an end by the peace of Utrecht in 1713. By this treaty Belgium was assigned to Austria, and took the name of the Austrian Netherlands. Yet such was the enfeebled state of the country that Holland retained the right, which had been conceded to her during the late war, of garrisoning the principal fortresses on the French frontier, and her right to close the navigation of the Scheldt was also recognised. In 1722 a commercial company was formed at Ostend by Charles VI., but this was sacrificed in 1731 to the jealousy of the Dutch. During the Austrian War of Succession almost the whole country fell into the hands of the French, but was restored to Austria by the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748). Belgium was undisturbed by the Seven Years’ War (1756-63), and during the long peace which followed enjoyed considerable prosperity under the mild rule of Maria Theresa, whose representative here, Prince Charles of Lorraine, conducted affairs with great judgment and moderation. The empress did much for the advancement of education, founding, among other institutions,the Belgian Academy of Sciences, and opposed the undue power of the clergy. Her son and successor, Joseph II., got into difficulties with Holland, and compelled that power to withdraw her garrisons from the frontier towns, but was unsuccessful iu his attempts to free the navigation of the Scheldt. It was, however, in his attempts to reform internal abuses that he failed most signally here as in other parts of his dominions. He excited the religious feelings of the people against him, by attempting to curb the power of the priests, and he offended the states by seeking to overturn the civil government. Numbers of the malcontents left the country, and organized themselves as a military force in Holland. As the discontent became more general the insurgents returned, took several forts, defeated the Austrians at Turnhout, and overran the country. On 11th December 1789, the people of Brussels rose against the Austrian garrison, and compelled it to capitulate, and on the 27th the states of Brabant declared their independence. The other provinces followed, and, on 11th January 1790, the whole formed themselves into an independent state under the name of United Belgium, with a congress to manage its affairs. After the death of Joseph II. his successor, Leopold II., issued a proclamation on 3d March 1790, wherein he promised the restoration of the former constitution if the people would return to their allegiance. This, however, they refused to do, and they also rejected the proposal of a congress to meet at the Hague for the settlement of their differences. In the end of November, therefore, a strong Austrian army was sent into Belgium, and the country was subdued without any great opposition. The constitution as it existed at the end of the reign of Maria Theresa was restored, an amnesty was proclaimed for past offences, and the opposition of the states was put down. The short period of peace which followed was terminated by the breaking out of the war with revolutionary France. The battle of Jemappes (7th Nov. 1792) made the French masters of the country to the south of Liège; and the battle of Fleurus (26th June 1794) put an end to the Austrian rule in Belgium. The treaty of Campo Formio (1797) and the subsequent treaty of Luneville (1801) confirmed the conquerors in the possession of the country, and Belgium became an integral part of France, being governed on the same footing, receiving the Code Napoleon, and sharing in the fortunes of the Republic and of the Empire. (See France.) After the fall of Napoleon and the conclusion of the first peace of Paris (30th May 1814), Belgium was for some months ruled by an Austrian governorgeneral, after which it was united with Holland under [9:3:527] Prince William Frederick of Nassau, who took the title of king of the Netherlands (23d March 1815). The Congress of Vienna (31st May 1815) determined the relations and fixed the boundaries of the new kingdom; and the new constitution was promulgated on the 24th of August following, the king taking the oath at Brussels, Sept. 27.

The union, however, was not a particularly fortunate or happy one. It was brought about by the allied powers with little regard to the wishes or inclinations of the people, their main object being to form here a strong kingdom to serve as a check upon the ambitious designs of France. The character, habits, language, and religion of the Belgians were all against such an alliance Through their connection and intercourse with France they had acquired much of the spirit, habits, and ideas of the people of that country; while the slow, staid, conservative habits and ideas of the Dutch were repugnant to them The Belgians were chiefly engaged in agriculture and the manufactures, while the Dutch were mainly given to commerce and the fisheries. The French was the common language of Belgium, at least in the higher circles and in all public proceedings. But the principal difficulty arose from the difference in religion. The Roman Catholic clergy of Belgium were from the first opposed to a union with a Protestant country like Holland, and the great mass of the people were very ignorant, and much under the influence of the priests Nevertheless, had a mild and conciliatory policy been adopted by the Dutch it would have done much to remove or lessen these difficulties This, however, was not done. Belgium was regarded too much in the light of a conquered country, at whose expense they might lawfully enrich themselves. Though the population of Belgium was 3,400,000 and that of Holland only 2,000,000, the latter had as many representatives in the States-general as the former. This frequently rendered decision on important legislative questions a matter of extreme doubt and difficulty. In matters that affected, or were believed to affect, the two countries in different or opposite ways, the decision often depended on the accidental absence of a member on the one side or the other. The use of the French language was also attempted to be abolished in all Government and judicial proceedings. The great majority of the public offices were filled by Dutchmen, and the government was conducted principally in the interests of Holland. In 1830, of the seven Government ministers only one was a Belgian; in the ministry of the interior, of 11“ officials only 11 were Belgians; in the ministry of war, of 102 officials only 3 were Belgians; and among 1967 officers of the army, only 288 were Belgians. The partisans of Holland attempt to explain away these facts, but with only very partial success; both sides, however, acquit the king of any intentional unfairness. and consider that he was led to act as he did by force of circumstances. The Belgians admit that he always manifested a sincere regard for their welfare, but accuse him of giving too ready an acquiescence to what they tauntingly called the schemes of their Dutch cousins.

Notwithstanding these drawbacks Belgium enjoyed daring her union with Holland a degree of prosperity that was quite remarkable. The mineral wealth of the country was largely developed, the iron manufactures of Liège rapidly advanced in prosperity, the woollen manufactures of Verviers received a similar impulse, and many large establishments were formed at Ghent and other places where cotton goods were fabricated which rivalled those of England and far surpassed those of France. The extensive colonial and foreign trade of the Dutch furnished them with new markets for their produce; while the opening of the navigation of the Scheldt raised Antwerp to a place of the first commercial importance. The Government also did much in the way of improving the internal communications of the country, in repairing the roads and canals, and forming new ones, deepening and widening rivers, and the like. Nor was the social and intellectual improvement of the people by any means neglected. A new university was formed at Liège, normal schools for the instruction of teachers were instituted, and numerous elementary schools and schools for higher instruction were established over the country. That the Government should take upon itself the direction and regulation of the education of the people was particularly hateful to the priests, still more so were the attempts subsequently made to improve the education of the priests themselves. The king had determined that no priest should be inducted who had not passed two years in the study of the literoe humaniores before his ordination; and he appropriated a college at Louvain for that purpose, some of the professors in which were not priests, but laymen and Protestants. This gave great offence to the prelates and clergy, and some of the former, who had indulged in very intemperate language, were prosecuted. These proceedings were at the time applauded and encouraged by the active party of the Liberals, but afterwards these saw it their interest to join with the most bigoted of the Roman Catholics against the Government. With the view of terminating these differences the king in 1827 entered into a concordat with the Pope, settling the right of nomination to the bishoprics, and providing that the education of the priests should be under the control of the prelates, but that in the seminaries professors should be appointed to teach the sciences as well as what related to ecclesiastical matters. This, however, was far from satisfying the more violent of the clergy; and the two most opposite parties, the Catholic Ultramontanes and the French Liberals, united their efforts to effect the overthrow of the Government. The Liberals affected a zeal for the Catholic faith, and urged the clergy to make extravagant demands upon the Government, which they knew if granted would be hurtful to it, and if refused would increase the agitation then going on. Brussels was at this time, too, a city of refuge for the intriguing and discontented of almost every country of Europe, and the press teemed with libels not only against the Belgian Government, but also against almost every other, so that the people were constantly kept in a high state of political excitement. At length the Government took proceedings against some of the more notorious of the inflammatory writers, and several of them were banished from the kingdom.

Matters were in this state when the news of the success of the Paris revolution of 1830 reached Belgium. Numbers of the propagandists came to Brussels, where they paraded the streets and talked loudly in the public places of the glories of the Revolution and of the future destinies of France. The first outbreak occurred on the 25th of August, just a month after the commencement of that of Paris. A play, called La Muette, which abounds in passages well calculated to inflame the populace in their then excited state, was performed in the theatre, and when the curtain fell the audience rushed out into the street shouting, “Imitons les Parisiens.” They were speedily joined by others, and the mob at once proceeded to deeds of violence, destroying or damaging a number of public buildings, manufactories, and private houses. The guards and posts in the centre of the city were overcome or quietly surrendered; the troops were drawn out, but they were too few in number to contend with the insurgents, and they either retreated to their barracks or were withdrawn to the upper part of the city, where they piled their arms in front of the king’s palace, and renounced all attempts at suppressing the tumult. A number of the more influential and the middleclass citizens now enrolled themselves into a burgher guard for the protection of life and property, and to interpose in [9:3:528] a manner between the contending parties. The intelligence of these events in the capital soon spread throughout the provinces; and in most of the large towns similar scenes were enacted, commencing with plunderings and outrages by the mobs, followed by the institution of burgher guards for the maintenance of peace. The burgher guard of Brussels was most anxious to terminate the dispute without recourse being had .to extreme measures. They demanded the dismissal of the minister, Van Maanen, who was obnoxious to the people, and a separate administration for Belgium without an entire separation of the two countries. The Government neither agreed to make these concessions nor did it resolve upon actual force, but adopted a sort of middle course which, by allowing things to go on, ended in converting a popular riot into a complete revolution. The heir-apparent, the prince of Orange, was sent on a peaceful mission to Brussels, but furnished with such limited powers as, in the circumstances, were utterly inadequate. On his arrival a conference was held, which extended over several days; and at the final meeting on 3d Sept., when a number of the members of the States-general were present, the prince had become so convinced that nothing but a separate administration of the two countries would restore tranquillity, that he promised to use his influence with his father to bring about that object—the persons present on their part assuring him that they would heartily unite in maintaining the dynasty of the House of Orange. The king summoned an extraordinary States-general, which met at the Hague, 13th Sept., and was opened by a speech from the throne, which was firm and temperate, but by no means definite. The proceedings of the body were dilatory, and the conduct of the Dutch deputies exasperated the people of Belgium beyond measure. The moderate party in the country gradually lost their influence, and those who were in favour of violent measures prevailed, while the warlike demonstrations made by the troops kindled a feeling of animosity and stimulated preparations for defence. Although the States were still sitting at the Hague, the king’s army was gradually approaching Brussels. It consisted of 14,000 well-appointed troops under the command of Prince Frederick; but its movements were too tardy if force was to be employed, and it was entirely out of place if conciliatory measures were to prevail. On 20th September the council resolved to take possession of Brussels, believing that the inhabitants were eager to receive the troops, and that their presence there would tend to restore peace; and orders were sent to Prince Frederick to that effect. On the 23d the troops advanced towards the city, and, with little opposition, occupied the upper or court portion of it, which is situated on a hill, by which the rest of the town is commanded. The fighting continued for three days without any definite result, when the prince ordered a retreat. The news of this soon reached Ghent, Bruges, Ostend, and other towns, which at once declared in favour of separation. A Provisional Government was formed at Brussels, which declared Belgium to be an independent state, and summoned a national congress for the regulation of its affairs. The council of the king now consented to separate administrations for the two kingdoms, but it was too late to restore peace. Antwerp was the only important town which remained in the hands of the Dutch, and the army on leaving Brussels had fallen back on this town. In the end of October an insurgent army had arrived before the gates, which were opened by the populace to receive them, and the troops, under General Chassé, retired within the citadel. A truce was concluded between the parties, but the Belgian officers were unable to restrain the fury of the populace who, with such weapons as they had, attacked the citadel. The general ordered a cannonade and bombardment of the town, which continued for two days, destroying a number of houses and large quantities of merchandise. A suspension of hostilities then took place, but the misrepresentations and exaggerations of the proceedings which spread did much to inflame the minds of the Belgians still farther against the Dutch.

A convention of representatives of the five great powers met in London, in the beginning of November, at the request of the king of the Netherlands, but its attention was mainly directed to bringing about peace, and through it both sides were brought to consent to a cessation of hostilities. On the 10th November the national congress assembled at Brussels, consisting of 200 deputies chosen from the different provinces. Three important questions were decided by that assembly :—(1.) The independence of the country,—carried unanimously; (2), a constitutional hereditary monarchy,—by a majority of 174 against 13 in favour of a republic; and (3), the perpetual exclusion of the Orange Nassau family,—by a majority of 161 against 28 in favour of delay. On 20th December the conference of London proclaimed the dissolution of the kingdom of the Netherlands, at the same time that it claimed for itself the right of interfering even against the will of both countries to regulate the conditions of partition. On the 28th of January 1831 the congress proceeded to the election of a king, and out of a number of candidates the choice fell on the duke of Nemours, second son of Louis Philippe, but he declined the office. The congress then resolved on the election of a regent as a temporary measure, and they selected Baron Surlet de Chokier, who was installed on the 25th of February. This, however, did little to restore tranquillity to the country, and the partisans of the prince of Orange were still actively intriguing in his favour. At length, in the month of April, a proposition was privately made to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, widower of the Princess Charlotte of England, with the view of ascertaining whether, if chosen, he would accept the crown. It is remarkable that though his name was mentioned he was not among the number of candidates brought forward on the previous occasion. He answered in the affirmative, but strictly abstained from giving any authority to exertion being made in his favour. After many stormy discussions the election at length took place on the 4th of June, when 152 votes out of 196, four only being absent, determined that Prince Leopold should be proclaimed king of the Belgians, under the express condition that he “would accept the constitution and swear to maintain the national independence and territorial integrity.” Leopold at once accepted,and made his public entry into Brusselson the21st, when he was received with great cordiality. He subsequently visited other parts of the kingdom, and was everywhere received with demonstrations of loyalty and respect. While this was going on news suddenly arrived that the Dutch were preparing to invade the country with a large army. This had been brought together so secretly that the Belgians were unaware of its existence till it was about to cross the frontier. It comprised 45,000 infantry and 6000 cavalry, with 72 pieces of artillery, while Leopold could scarcely bring forward 25,000 men to oppose it. On the 2d of August the whole of the Dutch army had crossed the frontier. Leopold collected his forces, such as they were, near Louvain in order to cover his capital. The Dutch army advanced to the attack (9 th August), and though the king displayed great bravery and determination, he was unable to impart his spirit to his undisciplined troops, who were speedily routed, the king himself and his staff making a narrow escape from being taken prisoners. He, however, made good his retreat to the capital; and a French army, which was ready to enter the country, then advanced, and the Prince of Orange saw the necessity of [9:3:529] retreating. A convention wa3 concluded between him and the French general, in consequence of which he returned to Holland and the French army repassed the frontier.

Leopold now proceeded with vigour to strengthen his position, and to restore order and confidence. French officers were selected for the training and disciplining of the army, the civil list was arranged with economy and order, and the other branches of the public service were reformed or rearranged. He kept on the best terms with the Homan Catholic clergy and the Roman Catholic nobility; and his subsequent marriage with a daughter of the French king (9th August 1832), and a contract that the children of the marriage should be educated in the Roman Catholic faith, did much to inspire confidence in his good intentions. While these things were going on the conference in London was engaged in determining the terms of peace, and a project of a treaty for the separation of the two states was drawn up and declared to be “final and irrevocable.” The first basis of separation had determined that the grandduchy of Luxembourg, which belonged to the king of Holland as grand-duke, should continue to belong to Holland. By the subsequent treaty of the eighteen articles, Belgium received the right to treat for the purchase or redemption of Luxembourg from Holland on fair terms. These articles were adopted by the Belgian congress in July 1831, but the king of Holland rejected them, and followed up his rejection, as we have seen, by the invasion of Belgium. The terms of the treaty which followed this invasion were much more favourable to Holland than those of the previous one; for the feeble resistance that Belgium had been able to make had affected very unfavourably the directing powers, who considered that, in the interests of the peace of Europe, their first duty was to strengthen the defensive power of Holland. The new proposals, therefore, caused great excitement in Belgium, and met with much opposition; but, eventually, they were adopted by a majority of 59 to 38 in the Chamber of Representatives, and 35 to 8 in the Senate.

The treaty was signed on 15th November, and its conditions were embraced in twenty-four articles. By these articles the grand-duchy of Luxembourg was to be divided, but the fortress of Luxembourg was to remain in the hands of the king of Holland as grand-duke, who was also to receive a portion of Limbourg for the part of Luxembourg ceded to Belgium. The district of Maestricht was also partitioned, the fortress of that name remaining with Holland; the Scheldt was to be open to the commerce of both countries, and the national debt was apportioned— to Belgium sixteen thirty-firsts, and the rest to Holland. It was also declared that Belgium “shall form an independent and perfectly neutral state.” 1 This agreement was ratified by the Belgian and French sovereigns on the 20th and 24th November, by the British, 6th December; but the Austrian and Prussian sovereigns did not accede to it till 18th April 1832, and the Russian not till 4th May. The Dutch still continued to protest against it, and maintained their possession of Antwerp. After fruitless efforts on the part of the great powers to obtain their acquiescence, France and England resolved to have recourse to force. On the 5th November, therefore, their combined fleets sailed for the coast of Holland, and on the 18th, a French army, under the command of Marshal Gérard, crossed the Belgian frontier to besiege Antwerp. The garrison consisted of only about 5000 men. while the besieging force numbered 60,000. Operations commenced 30th November, and the siege in a military point of view is a memorable one. The garrison surrendered to the

French on 23d December, on the 31st the fortress was handed over to the Belgians, and some days afterwards the French troops recrossed the frontier. Long and complicated diplomatic negotiations followed, but matters were at length adjusted, and on the 21st of May 1833 a convention waβ agreed to and signed by all the parties. The House of Orange still numbered many partisans in Belgium, whose proceedings embarrassed the Government; and in Brussels, and some of the other towns, the people rose up against them, pillaging the houses of some of the leaders, and were appeased with difficulty. The king now gave his attention to the improvement of the manufactures and commerce of Belgium; and on 1st May 1834 he sanctioned the law which was to create the first railroad on the continent of Europe.

In 1835 the alien bill gave rise to considerable discussion, but it was at length carried. Its object was to give Government the power to send out of the kingdom, or to compel to reside in a particular place, any foreigner whose conduct was calculated to endanger the public peace. In 1836 an Act to regulate the municipal form of government in the towns and communes was passed. The election of the members of the municipal councils was continued in the citizens, but the appointment of the burgomaster and magistrates was vested in the king from among the members of the councils. The manufactures and commerce continued to flourish and extend, and the formation of railways was actively carried on. As Holland had not yet acceded to all the conditions of the twenty-four articles, Belgium still kept possession of the whole of Limbourg and Luxembourg except the fortress of the latter, with a small area round it, which was occupied by Prussian troops. These territories had been treated in every way as a part of Belgium, and had sent representatives to both chambers. Great indignation was therefore felt at the idea of their being separated, when Holland, on 14th of March 1838, signified its readiness to accept the conditions of the treaty. The chambers argued that Belgium had been induced to agree to the twenty-four articles in 1832 in the hope of thereby at once terminating all harassing disputes, but that as Holland did not then accept them, the conditions were no longer binding, and the circumstances were now quite changed. They urged that Luxembourg in effect formed an integral part of their territory, and that the people were totally opposed to a union with Holland. They offered to pay for the territory in dispute, but the treaty gave them no right of purchase, and the proposal was not entertained. The two chambers unanimously voted addresses to the king, expressing a hope that the integrity of Belgium would be maintained. Similar addresses were sent from all parts of the country, and the people were roused to a great state of excitement. The king was at one with his people, and every preparation was made for war. But the firmness of the allied powers, and their determination to uphold the conditions of the treaty, at last brought the king, though with extreme reluctance, to give in to their views. After violent discussions the Chamber of Representatives gave its adhesion on 19th March 1839, and some days later the Senate followed the example. The treaty was signed at London on the 19th of April. The annual payment by Belgium for its share of the national debt, which had been fixed at 8,400,000 florins, was reduced to 5,000,000 florins, or £416,666, with quittance of arrears prior to 1st January 1839. When this excitement was at its height the Bank of Brussels failed, and much misery and distress among the people was the result. This was immediately followed by the failure of the Brussels Savings-Bank, but the Government instantly came forward and guaranteed the claims thereupon, amounting to 1,500,000 florins.

[9:3:530]

The Belgian revolution owed its success to the union of the Roman Catholics and the Liberals; and the king had been very careful to maintain the alliance between these two parties. This continued to be the character of the Government up to 1840, but by degrees it had been becoming more and more conservative, and was giving rise to dissatisfaction. A ministry was formed on more liberal principles, but - it clashed with the Catholic aristocracy, who had the majority in the Senate. Disputes arose which caused great excitement among the people, and the cabinet resigned. A new ministry was then formed, under Μ. Nothomb, of a unionist or mixed kind. In 1842 a new law for the organization of public primary instruction was passed, which, however, did not meet with the approval of the clergy. In 1844 a commercial treaty was concluded with the German Zollverein; and soon after similar treaties were formed with France and Holland. The Nothomb ministry retired in 1845, and for seven months Μ. Van de Weyer attempted to carry on affairs with a mixed ministry; but he found it impossible to maintain harmony among the different factions. A Catholic administration was then formed, which was attacked with the greatest fury by the Liberals. The latter summoned a Liberal congress to meet at Brussels (14th June 1846), composed of delegates from the different Liberal associations throughout the country. Three hundred delegates met and deliberated with the greatest calmness, drawing up an Act of Federation and a programme of Belgian Liberalism. The elections of 1847 gave a majority in favour of the Liberals; the cabinet resigned, and a Liberal administration took its place and formally announced a new policy. Hence it happened that when next year France was in revolution and her king a fugitive, Belgium remained calm and unshaken. When the news reached Brussels the king convoked a council of his ministers and offered to resign if they thought that it would avert calamity or conduce to the public welfare. The ministers replied that a constitutional monarchy was best fitted for the people, and that a republic was neither according to their wishes nor adapted to their character. The democratic societies of Brussels attempted a revolutionary movement, but met with little success. At this time a new electoral law was issued lowering the franchise to 20 florins’ worth of property (33s. 4d,), by which the number of electors was at once doubled; and soon after another law reduced the qualification for municipal councils to 46 francs (36s.) These timely concessions gave general satisfaction, and completely disarmed the extreme democratic party; so that when an expedition was organized in Paris against the throne of Leopold, with the countenance and aid of certain members of the French Government, it met with no sympathy and totally failed in its object. On the night of the 24th March the conspirators, to the number of about 800 French and 100 Belgians, arrived at Quievrain by train, but they were at once surrounded by the military and peasants and made prisoners. Alarmed at this attempt the Government strongly reinforced the frontier towns witjι troops, and was thus able to repulse a more formidable invasion that took place a few days later. Belgium, however, suffered severely from the shock given to commercial credit and general industry. The discounts at the bank, which in 1847 had been 160,200,000 francs, sank, in 1848, to 86,900,000 francs, and the current accounts fell from 183,000,000 francs to 96,000,000 francs. The panic soon rendered the payment of notes in cash impossible; and the Government, by a ιaw passed 28th March 1848, suspended cash payments, and authorized the bank to issue inconvertible notes to a limited extent. By this seasonable measure public credit was restored, and industry speedily revived.

The attention of the Government was now largely directed to the stimulating of private industry and the carrying out of public works of great practical utility, as the extension of railways and the opening up of other internal means of communication. Commercial treaties were also entered into with various countries with the view of providing additional outlets for industrial products. The king also sought as much as possible to remove from the domain of politics every irritating question, believing that a union of the different parties was most for the advantage of the state. In 1850 the question of middle class education was settled. In August of that year the whole country between Brussels and the French frontier suffered greatly from excessive rains; the country for many leagues was flooded, many lives were lost, and the destruction of property was very great. On 25th September the king laid the foundation stone of a monument in Brussels to commemorate the national congress which in 1831 had fashioned the new destinies of the country, and on 11th October the queen died. In 1852 the Liberal cabinet was overthrown, and a ministry of conciliation was formed. A bill was passed authorizing the army to be raised to 100,000 men including reserve. The elections of 1854 modified the parliamentary situation by increasing the strength of the Conservatives; the ministry resigned and a new one was formed under Μ. de Decker, of moderate Catholics and Progressives. At the Paris conference of 1856, which settled the peace with Russia, the French minister, Count Walewski, complained of Belgium permitting to issue from its press publications the most hostile and insulting to France and her government, in which revolt and assassination were openly advocated. The remarks caused great indignation in Belgium. In 1857 violent discussions took place between the Liberal party and the Roman Catholics on the question of the administration of charities throughout the kingdom. Since 1830 the administration of these had been vested in the secular power, and the Catholic party had long sought to get this power into their own hands. When, therefore, Μ. de Decker, who supported their views, became head of the ministry, the priests made every exertion, even by bribery, to influence the elections so as to obtain a majority in their favour. In April the ministry of Μ. de Decker brought in a bill practically abolishing the existing law on the subject. The bill met with the most violent opposition; the discussions, which extended over 27 sittings and were characterized by great animosity, revealed a growing spirit of exaction and intolerance on the part of the clergy; but eventually it was carried by a majority of 60 to 41. The result caused great excitement among the people, the Liberal deputies were cheered, and the principal Catholic speakers hooted and insulted. The agitation extended to the provinces, and the military had to be called out to restore peace. Eventually the bill was withdrawn, and the ministers gave in their resignations. The elections for the communal councils gave a great majority in all the important towns in favour of the Liberals. A new Liberal ministry was formed under Μ. Rogier. In 1860 the communal octrois, or the taxes on articles of food brought into the towns, were abolished; and in 1863 the navigation of the Scheldt was made free. This last year, also, a treaty of commerce and navigation was concluded with England. The elections of July 1864 gave a majority to the Liberals in the Chamber of Representatives, and the ministry of Μ. Rogier continued in office.

On the 10th December 1865 King Leopold died, after a reign of 34 years. He was greatly beloved by his people, and much respected by the other sovereigns of Europe. He was repeatedly chosen to decide in international disputes; and the grievances of hostile Governments were not unfrequently submitted to him. His well-known [9:3:531] honesty and integrity of purpose, his reflective and well-balanced intellect, his habit of close and accurate reasoning, his grave and serious deportment, all eminently fitted him for the office of arbiter. To him Belgium owed much. In difficult circumstances and critical times he managed its affairs with great tact and judgment; by conciliatory measures he reconciled and kept at peace opposing factions; and by his well-known devotion to the best interests of the country he secured the confidence and esteem of all classes of the people. He was succeeded by his eldest son Leopold II., who was immediately proclaimed king, and took the oath to the constitution on 17th December. In 1866 a body of English volunteers, to the number of 1100, visited Belgium by invitation, and met with a most cordial reception from the king and all classes of the people, and took part in the Tir National· The following year a body of Belgian volunteers, numbering about 2400, came over to England, where they were warmly welcomed, and engaged in the shooting contests at Wimbledon. In 1868 serious riots took place in the mining districts, which were not put down till the military had been called out; the effective army was raised from 80,000 to 100,000 men, and the yearly contingent from 10,000 to 12,000. Attempts were also made to obtain a revision of the elementary education law of 1842.

On the outbreak of the war between France and Germany in 1870, Belgium saw the difficulty and danger of her position, and lost no time in providing for contingencies. A large war credit was voted, the strength of the army was raised, and large detachments were moved to the frontier. The feeling of danger to Belgium also caused great excitement in England, particularly after the contents of the secret treaty —which revealed the aggrandising schemes of France against Belgium—became known. The British Government declared its intention to maintain the integrity of Belgium in accordance with the treaty of 1839, and it induced the two belligerent powers to sign treaties to that effect. In the event of either power violating the neutrality of Belgium, England was to co-operate with the other in such manner as might be mutually agreed upon to secure the integrity of the country. It was at first feared that Belgian territory might be violated by the necessities of one or other of the belligerents, but this was not the case. A considerable portion of the French army routed at Sedan did, indeed, take refuge in Belgian territory; but they laid down their arms according to convention, and were “interned” in the king’s dominions,

In 1870 the Liberal party, who had been in power for thirteen years, was overthrown by a union of the Catholics with the Radicals or Progressionists, joined by not a few Liberals, to whom the opposition of the Government to certain reforms had given offence. A ministerial crisis followed, which was terminated by the advent to office of a Catholic cabinet, at the head of which was Baron d’Anethan. A new election took place in August 1870, which gave them a majority in both houses,—a result brought about in no small degree by the excitement consequent on the breaking out of the Franco-German war. The Baron d’Anethan steered his course prudently, and increased the power of the Ultramontanes considerably by carrying a reform bill, which widened the basis of representation as regarded the provincial and communal councils, by introducing large masses of the Catholic lower orders to the privilege of the franchise. It added nearly one-half to the number of electors for the provincial councils, and more than a fourth to those for the communal councils. The Liberals were very much dissatisfied; and towards the end of the year the mob in Brussels took up the question, and tumults broke out which the police and civic guard had to put down by force. They demanded the dismissal of the ministers, to which the king at length consented; and a new ministry was formed under Μ. de Theux. The communal elections of 1872 were the occasion of a sharp struggle throughout the kingdom between the church party and the Liberals, but success remained chiefly with the latter. The elections of June 1874 resulted in a considerable reduction of the Ultramontane majority within the Senate and the Chamber of Representatives, without actually converting it into a minority. In July of that year a conference of representatives of the leading powers of Europe was held in Brussels, with the view of introducing certain changes in the usages of war, but no definite result was arrived at In May and June 1875, religious disturbances broke out in various parts, which were attended with serious consequences. At Brussels, Ghent, and other places, religious processions, which partook of the character of party demonstrations, were attacked by mobs of the populace, and many persons were injured. These disturbances were only put a stop to by energetic measures on the part of those in authority, and the infliction of severe punishments on the delinquents.

The attention of foreign states has of late been particularly directed to Belgium, in consequence of certain remonstrances addressed to it by Germany on the subject of its international relations and its duties towards foreign powers. This arose from an obscure Belgian, named Duchesne, having written to a French archbishop, offering to assassinate Prince Bismarck for a consideration. He was taken and tried by the Belgian Government, but it was found that the law had provided no punishment for the offence which he had committed. This led to a remonstrance on the part of the German Government, which was couched in such terms as to afford ground for the gravest fears, on the part of Belgium and of foreign states, as to what might be the result. The correspondence, however, was carried on in a friendly spirit on both sides, satisfactory explanations followed, and the Belgian Government passed a measure making such offences as that of Duchesne criminal.
