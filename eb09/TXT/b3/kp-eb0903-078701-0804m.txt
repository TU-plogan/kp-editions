BISCAY, or Vizcaya, one of the three Basque provinces of Spain, with the title of Seignory. It is bounded on the N. by the bay to which it gives its name, E. by Guipuzcoa, S. by Alava, and W. by Santander. Its area is 845 square miles, and its population in 1867 was 183,098. The coastline, which extends from Ondarroa to a short distance to the east of Castro, is bold and rugged, and in some places is deeply indented. The only river of any size is the Nervion or Ibaizabal, on which Bilbao is situated; the others, which are numerous, are merely large mountain streams. The surface of the country is for the most part very mountainous, but at the same time is diversified with numerous narrow valleys and small plains. Some of the mountains are almost entirely composed of naked calcareous rock, but most of them are covered to their summits with forests of oaks, chestnuts, or pine trees. Holly and arbutus are also common, and furze and heath abound in the poorer parts. The province produces wheat, maize, barley, rye, flax, grapes, peaches, apples, and other fruits. The' farms are generally small, and are for the most part tilled by manual labour. The wild boar, lynx, fox, and other wild animals, are found in the forests; and deer, rabbits, partridges, woodcocks, and other kinds of game are plentiful. Sheep and goats are the principal domestic animals. In minerals Biscay is very rich. Iron of the finest quality is found in almost every part, and forms a main article of export. The best mines are those of Somorostro, near the coast. The amount obtained in 1866 was about 80,000 tons. Lead, zinc, alum, and sulphur, are also present in smaller quantities; and marble, lime, and sandstone are abundant. The manufacture of the iron ore is the chief branch of industry; but porcelain, linens, copper and brass wares, ropes, and leather, are also produced. The fisheries are actively prosecuted along the coast by a hardy race of fishers, who were the first of their craft in Europe to pursue the whale, formerly abundant in the Bay of Biscay. Cod, bream, tunny, and anchovy are the principal fish taken. Bilbao is the capital of the province, with a population of 17,649; the other towns, Portugalete, Miravalles, Durango, and Orozco, are all very small. The principal ports, besides Portugalete, are Plencia, Bermeo, and Hea. After the fall of the Romans this Cantabrian province came successively into the hands of the Suevi, Franks, and Goths, and formed for some time an independent lordship. The legislative authority was exercised by the lord and a junta of popular representatives. The latter regularly assembled every two years, and on any emergency held an extraordinary meeting under an old tree at Guernica. Although incorporated with Spain, the Biscayans still maintain a republican form of administration, nominating their own governors and magistrates, regulating the amount of the taxes, and exercising various other privileges. They are a brave and active people, and their history is largely composed of exploits in defence of their liberties. For their linguistic and ethnographic affinities, see the article Basque Provinces. The name Biscay is not unfrequently employed as geographically equivalent to Basque, in that case including the three provinces of Biscay proper, Guipuzcoa, and Alava.
