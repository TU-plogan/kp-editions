LUSHAI or KUKI HILLS, a wild and imperfectly known tract of country on the north-eastern frontier of India, extending along the southern border of the Assam district of Câchâr and the eastern border of the Bengal district of Chittagong. On the east, the Lushâi Hills stretch away into the unexplored mountains of Independent Burmah. This extensive region is occupied by a numerous family of tribes known to us indifferently as Lushâis or Kukis. All these tribes are nomadic in their habits, and subject to successive waves of migration. It is said that at the present time the entire race of the Lushâis is being forced southwards into British territory under pressure from the Soktis, a tribe advancing upon them from Independent Burmah. The principal characteristic common to all the Lushâis, and in which they markedly differ from the other tribes on the Assam frontier, is their feudal organization under hereditary chiefs. Each village is under the military command of a chief, who must come of a certain royal stock. The chief exercises absolute power in the village; and his dignity and wealth are maintained by a large number of slaves and by fixed contributions of labour from his free subjects. Cultivation is carried on according to the nomadic system of tillage on temporary clearings in the jungle; but the main occupation of the people is hunting and warfare

From the earliest times the Lushâis have been notorious for their sanguinary raids into British territory, which are said to be instigated by their desire to obtain human heads for use at their funeral ceremonies.· The first of which we have record was in 1777. In 1849 a colony of Lushâis settled within Câchâr, was attacked by their independent kinsmen, and forced to migrate northwards across the Barak river, where they now live as peaceable British subjects, and are known as “Old Kukis.” In 1860a raid was made upon Tiρperah district, in which 186 Bengali villagers were massacred and 100 carried away into captivity. Retributive expeditions, consisting of small forces of sepoys, were repeatedly sent to punish these raids, but, owing to the difficult nature of the country and the fugitive tactics of the enemy, no permanent advantage was gained. At last the disturbed state of the frontier attracted the attention of the supreme government. A military demonstration in 1869 had entirely failed in its object. Relying upon their belief in the impracticable character of their native country, the Lushâis made a series of simultaneous attacks in January 1871 upon British villages in Câchâr, Sylhet, and Tipperah, as well as on the independent state of Manipur. The outpost of Monierkhâl repelled a number of attacks, lasting through two days, made by a second body of Lushâis from the eastern tribes, who finally retired with a large amount of plunder, including many coolies and guns. Lord Mayo, the viceroy, resolved to make a vigorous effort to stop those inroads, once and for all. A punitive expedition was organized, composed of two Gιirkha battalions, two Punjab and two Bengal native infantry regiments, two companies of sappers and miners, and a detachment of the Peshâwar mountain battery. This little army was divided into two columns, one advancing from Câchâr and the other from the Chittagong side. Both columns were completely successful. The resistance of the Lushâis, though obstinate in parts, was completely overcome, and the chiefs made their personal submission and accepted the terms offered them. Upwards of one hundred British subjects were liberated from captivity. The actual British loss in fighting was very small, but a large number of soldiers and camp-followers died from cholera. Since this expedition, the Lushâis have remained quiet along the entire frontier, and active measures have been taken to open commercial intercourse between them and the people of the plains. Many bdzdιrs have been established for this purpose, and trade by barter is now freely carried on.
