LOUTH, a municipal borough and market-town of Lincolnshire, England, is pleasantly situated on the river Lud, and on a branch of the Great Northern Railway, 25 miles east-north-east of Lincoln. By means of a canal, completed in 1763, at a cost of <£28,000, there is water communication with Hull. The town is about a mile in length, and is well built and paved. The church of St James, completed about 1516, in the Later English style, wdth a spire 288 feet in height, is one of the finest ecclesiastical buildings in the county. There are an Edward VI. grammar school, which is richly endowed, a commercial school founded in 1676, and a national school. The other public buildings include a town-hall, a corn exchange, and a market-hall. In the vicinity are the ruins of a Cistercian abbey, founded in 1139. The industries include the manufacture of carpets, tanning, iron-founding, brewing, malting, lime burning, and rope and brickmaking.

The population, which in 1851 was 10,467, had increased in 1871 to 10,500, and in 1881 to 10,690.

Louth is a corruption of Ludôl, the ancient name of the river Lud. It received a charter of incorporation from Edward VI. In 1536 the town took part in the “Pilgrimage of Grace,” on which account the vicar was executed at Tyburn. Alfred and Charles Tennyson were educated at the grammar school, and their little volume entitled Poems by Two Brothers was published by a Louth bookseller, whose shop still exists.
