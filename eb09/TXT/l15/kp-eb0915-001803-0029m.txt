LOUIS X., Le Hutin, was the eldest son of Philip IV. (the Fair) and Joan of Navarre, and was born in 1289. He succeeded his mother in the kingdom of Navarre and countships of Champagne and Brie in 1305. Historians are not agreed as to the origin of the surname (“The Quarreller ”) by which he is known in France, but it seems with most probability to commemorate the wild and boisterous character of his youth. He succeeded his father in 1314, and died, after a short and unimportant reign of less than two years, in June 1316. He was succeeded by his brother Philip V.
