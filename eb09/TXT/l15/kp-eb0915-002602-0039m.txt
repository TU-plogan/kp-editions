LOUVIERS, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Eure, France, is pleasantly situated, in a green valley surrounded by wooded hills, on the Eure (here divided into many branches),· 71 miles west-north-west from Paris, and some 13 miles from Rouen and Evreux. The old part of the town, built of wood, stands on the left bank of the river; the more modern portions, in brick and hewn stone, on the right. There are several good squares, and the place is surrounded by boulevards. The Gothic church of Notre Dame has a fine square tower, recently restored, and a portal which ranks among the richest and most beautiful works of the kind produced in the 15th century; it contains several interesting works of art. The chief industry of Louviers is the cloth and flannel manufacture. There are also nineteen wool-spinning mills, five fulling mills, and important thread factories; and papermaking, tanning, currying and tawing, dyeing, and bleaching are also carried on. The town has a court of first instance, a tribunal of commerce, chambers of manufactures and agriculture, and a council of prudhommes. The population in 1876 was 10,973.

Louviers was originally a villa of the dukes of Normandy; its cloth-making industry first arose in the beginning of the 13th century. It changed hands once and again during the Hundred Years’ War, and from Charles VII. it received extensive privileges, and the title of Louviers le Franc for the bravery of its inhabitants in driving the English from Pout de ΓArche, Verneuil, and Harcourt. It passed through various troubles successively at the period of the “ligue du bien public” under Louis XL, in the religious wars (when the parliament of Rouen sat for a time at Louviers), and in the wars of the Fronde. Its industries nevertheless developed steadily; before the Revolution its production of cloth amounted to 3000 pieces annually, in 1837 the number had risen to 15,000, and it is still greater now.
