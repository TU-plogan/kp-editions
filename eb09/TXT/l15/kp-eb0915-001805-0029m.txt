LOUIS XII. was born at Blois in 1462. His father was Charles, duke of Orleans, the grandson of Charles V. and the cousin of Charles VII., who spent twenty-five years of captivity in England, and who still holds an honourable place on the roll of French poets. Louis himself was for three years (1487-90) the prisoner of his second cousin, Charles VIII., in the castle of Bourges, but afterwards seconded his ambitious schemes faithfully and well, and on his death (1498) succeeded him, taking the titles of king of France, Jerusalem, and the Two Sicilies, and duke of Milan. For the events of his reign see France, vol. ix. pp. 554,555. He died on January 1, 1515, and was succeeded by Francis I.
