LOTUS-EATERS (Greek Λωτοφάγοι) were a Libyan tribe known to the Greeks as early as the time of Homer. Herodotus (iv. 177) describes their country as in the [9:15:12] Syrtic district, and says that a caravan route led from it to Egypt. The lotus still grows there in great abundance. It is a prickly shrub, the jujube tree, bearing a fruit of a sweet taste, compared by Herodotus to that of the date; it is still eaten by the natives, and a kind of wine is made from the juice (see Jujube). Marvellous tales were current among the early Greeks of the virtues of the lotus, as we see in Odys., ix. 84. When Ulysses comes to the coast many of his sailors eat the lotus and lose all wish to return home. The idea has been worked up by Tennyson in a very fine poem. This lotus must not be confounded with the Egyptian plant, a kind of water-lily that grows in the Nile. See Ritter, Erdkunde, i.; and Heeren, Ideen, ii., or in Historical liesearches, &c.
