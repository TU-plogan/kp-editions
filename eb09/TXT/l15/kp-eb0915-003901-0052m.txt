LUCCA, Baths of(Bagni di Lucca, formerly Bagno a Corsena), a commune of Italy in the province of Lucca, containing a number of famous watering-places. They are situated in the valley of the Lima, a tributary of the Serchio; and the district is known in the early history of Lucca as the Vicaria di Vai di Lima. Ponte Serraglio (16 miles to the north of Lucca) is the principal village; but there are warm springs and baths also at Villa, Docce Bassi, Bagno Caldo, &c. Bagno a Corsena is mentioned in 1284 by Guidone da Corvaia, a Pisan historian (Muratori, vol. xxii.); and by the 16th century the waters had attained great celebrity. Fallopius, who gave them credit for the cure of his own deafness, sounded their praises in 1569; and they have been more or less in fashion since. The temperature of the water varies from 96° to 133° Fahr.; in all cases it gives off carbonic acid gas, and contains lime, magnesium, and sodium products. In the village of Bagno Caldo there is a considerable hospital, constructed largely at the expense of Nicholas Demidoff in 1826. The population of the commune was 11,000 in 1881.
