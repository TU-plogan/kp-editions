LUDLOW, Edmund (1620-1693), was born at Maiden Bradley, Wiltshire, in 1620, of an ancient and honourable family. He studied at Trinity College, Oxford (where he took his B.A. degree in 1636), and at the Temple. When the war broke out he engaged as a volunteer in the life guard of Lord Essex, consisting of one hundred gentlemen. His first essay in arms was at Worcester, his next at Edgehill. He was made governor of Wardour Castle in 1643, which place he surrendered on honourable terms after ten months’ siege. On being exchanged soon afterwards, he engaged as major of Sir A. Haslerig’s regiment of horse,· in which capacity he did good service in the western counties. He was present at the second battle of Newbury, October 1644. In 1645 he was elected M.P. for Wilts in the room of his father Sir Henry Ludlow, and attached himself inflexibly to the republican party. In 1648 he was one of a committee of six who arranged the violent action known as Pride’s Purge. He was one of the king's judges, and put his hand to the warrant for his execution. In January 1651 Ludlow was sent into Ireland as lieutenant-general of horse, holding also a civil commission. Here he spared neither health nor money in the public service. Ireton, the deputy of Ireland, died 27th November 1651, and for six months Ludlow held the chief place, which he then resigned to Fleetwood. Though disapproving of Cromwell’s action in dissolving the Long Parliament, he maintained his employment, but when Cromwell was declared Protector he declined to acknowledge his authority, and was soon after recalled to England. He refused the Protector face to face when ordered to submit to his government, and in December 1655 retired to his own house in Essex. After Oliver Cromwell’s death Ludlow was returned for the borough of Hindon, and took his seat in Richard’s parliament in 1659. He sat also in the restored Rump, and was a member of its councilof state andof the committee of safety after its second expulsion. He also held office for a short time in Ireland. After the Restoration, finding that his life was in danger, he left England, in September 1660, and travelled through France and Geneva, and thence to Vevey, then under the protection of the canton of Bern. There he spent the rest of his long life unmolested, to the great credit of the Government of that canton, which had also extended its protection to other regicides. He was, however, in constant danger from Cavalier assassins. He steadily refused during thirty years of exile to have anything to do with the desperate enterprises of republican plotters. But in 1689 he returned to England, hoping to be employed in Irish affairs. He was, however, known only as a regicide; and an address from the House of Commons was presented to William III. by Sir Edward Seymour, requesting the king to issue a proclamation for his arrest. Ludlow escaped again, and returned to Vevey, where he died in 1693, aged seventy-three, and where a monument raised to his memory by his widow is still to be seen in the church of St Martin. Over the door of the house in which he lived was placed the inscription “Omne solum forti patria, quia Patris.” His memoirs, extending to the year 1688, were published in 1698-99 at Vevey.
