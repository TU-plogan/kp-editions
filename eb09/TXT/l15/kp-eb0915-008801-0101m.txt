LUXEMBURG, a province of the kingdom of Belgium, lying at the south-eastern extremity of the country, and bounded N. and W. by the provinces of Liege and Namur, S. by France, and E. by Prussia and by the grand-duchy of Luxemburg, from which it was separated in 1839. It is the largest and most thinly populated of the Belgian provinces,—75 miles in length, 30 in breadth; the population is 204,000. The ground is high, averaging 1200 feet above sea-level, and rising in parts over 2000. The soil is dry and slaty, with occasional sand and limestone. The aspect of the country is a succession of broad tracts of table land or plateaus covered with wood or heather, and intersected by wide and deep valleys; these contain streams, half-dry during the summer, but quickly changed to sweeping torrents by rain or melting snow. Peat is found on the hills, and occasional morasses, known by the name of “hautes fanges,” are to be met with on the tops of the. highest mountains. The whole district is comprised within, the region of Ardennes. The agricultural produce is poor; the various breeds of horses, cattle, sheep, &c., are remarkably small, though they all possess individual qualities· of endurance or their flesh of flavour; the hams are renowned. The forests abound in game of all kinds; red deer are plentiful, and wild boars have of late become: so abundant as to be a serious nuisance. The mineral productions are worthy of note. Iron is found in the valley of the Ourthe, and also farther south near Arion; lead is extracted at Longwilly, manganese at Biham, zine at Longwilly and Bleid. Building stone is to be had throughout the province, and is generally employed, brick houses being the exception. There are quarries of grey and rose-coloured marble at Wellin, and extensive slate·, quarries on the banks of the Semois, the Sure, and the Salm. The trade in wood and bark is considerable, and there are some important tanneries, as well as iron works, paper-mills, and limekilns. The principal rivers are the Semois, the Lesse, and the Ourthe, affluents of the Meuse, and the Sure, which flows into the Rhine; of these the Ourthe alone is navigable for a few miles down from Barvaux. There are no canals in the province, so that Luxemburg is entirely dependent on railways for its traffic. The Brussels and Basel line runs through the whole province, with a station at Arion, the capital; and branch lines have been established to connect the principal markets, Marche, Durbuy, Bastogne, Virton, &c., with the main artery. The language spoken by the inhabitants is French, with an admixture of Walloon dialect and an inferior kind of German on the borders of the grand-duchy. The king of the Belgians and his brother the count of Flanders possess summer residences, with extensive forest lands, in the province of Luxemburg.
