LÜNEBURG, the chief town of a district in the Prussian province of Hanover, is situated near the foot of a small hill named the Kalkberg, and on the river Ilmenau, 14 miles above its confluence with the Elbe, and 30 miles to the south-east of Hamburg. Numerous handsome mediaeval buildings testify to its former prosperity, and part of the old town-wall also still survives. Of its four churches three—those of St John, St Nicholas, and St Michael—are large and fine Gothic edifices of the 14th and 15th centuries. The principal secular buildings are the town-house, a huge pile dating from the 13th to the 18th century, the old palace, and the convent of St Michael, now converted into a school. Lüneburg owes its importance chiefly to the gypsum and lime quarries of the Kalkberg, which afford the materials for its cement works, and to the productive salt-spring at its base. Hence the ancient saying, which, grouping with these the commercial facilities afforded by the bridge over the Ilmenau, ascribes the prosperity of Lüneburg to its mans, fans, pons. The industries of the town also include the making of ironware, soda, and haircloth. Population in 1880, 19,045.

Lüneburg existed as early as the days of Charlemagne, but did not become of any importance till after the erection of a convent and a castle on the Kalkberg in the 10th century. The decisive event, however, in fixing its future development was the destruction, in 1189, of Bardewieck, situated on the Ilmenau below Lüneburg, and then the chief commercial town in North Germany. Lüneburg inherited its trade, and subsequently appears as one of the leading towns in the Hanseatic League. From 1267 to 1369 it was the capital of an independent principality of its own name, and it was afterwards frequently involved in the quarrels of the Guelphic princes. It reached the height of its prosperity in the 15th century, and even in the 17th was the depot for all the merchandise exported from Saxony and Bohemia to the mouth of the Elbe. The German war of liberation in 1813 was begun by an engagemen; with the French under General Morand near Lüneburg. Lüneburg gives its name to the Lüneburger Haide or Lüneburg Heath, an immense tract of moorland occupying the greater part of eastern Hanover.
