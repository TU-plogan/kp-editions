LÜCKE, Gottfried Christian Friedrich (1791 — 1855), theologian, was born on August 24, 1791, at Egeln near Magdeburg, where his father was a merchant, received his early education at the Magdeburg gymnasium, and studied theology at Halle and Göttingen (1810-13). In 1813 he became repetent at Göttingen, and in 1814 he received the degree of doctor in philosophy from Halle; in 1816 he removed to Berlin, where he became licentiate in theology, and qualified as “privatdocent.” He soon became intimate with Schleiermacher and De Wette, and was associated with them in 1818 in the redaction of the Theologische Zeitschrift. Meanwhile his lectures and publications (among the latter a Grundriss der HeτctestamenUichen Hermeneutik, 1816) had brought him into considerable repute, and he was appointed professor extraordinarius in the new university of Bonn in the spring of 1818; in the following autumn he became professor ordinarius. From Bonn, where he had Augusti, Gieseler, and Nitzsch for colleagues, he was called to Göttingen to succeed Stäudlin in 1827. Here he remained, declining all further calls elsewhere, as to Erlangen, Kiel, Halle, Tübingen, Jena, and Leipsic, until his death, which occurred on February 14, 1855.

Lücke, who was one of the most learned, many-sided, and influential of the so-called “mediation” school of evangelical theologians, is now known chiefly by his principal work, an Exposition of the Writings of St John, of which the first edition, in four volumes, appeared in 1820-32; it has since passed through two new and improved editions (the last volume of the third edition by Bertheau, 1856). He is one of the most intelligent maintainers of the Johanniπe authorship of the Fourth Gospel; in connexion with this thesis he was one of the first to argue for the early date and non-apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse.
