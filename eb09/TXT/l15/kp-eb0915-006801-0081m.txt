LURGAN, a market-town in the county of Armagh and province of Ulster, Ireland, is situated a few miles south of Lough Neagh, and 20 miles south-west of Belfast by rail. It consists principally of one spacious and well-built street. The parish church of Shankill has a finely proportioned tower. The other principal public buildings are the town-hall, the mechanicsâ€™ institute, the model school, and the linen-hall. Contiguous to the town is Brownlow House, a fine Elizabethan structure, the seat of Lord Lurgan. Of late years the linen trade of the town has much increased, and there are also tobacco factories and coach factories. From 7774 in 1861 the population increased in 1871 to 10,632, but in 1881 it was only 10,184.

Lurgan was built by William Brownlow, to whom a grant of the town was made by James I. In 1619 it consisted of forty-two houses, all inhabited by English settlers. It was burned by the insurgents in 1641, and again by the troops of James II. After its restoration in 1690 a patent for a market and fair was obtained.
