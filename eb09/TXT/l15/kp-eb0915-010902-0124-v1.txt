LYNN REGIS, King’s Lynn, or Lynn, a parliamentary and municipal borough and seaport of Norfolk, England, is situated on the Great Ouse, about 2 miles from the Wash, and on several railway lines, 100 miles north of London and 48 west-north-west of Norwich. On the land side the town was formerly defended by a fosse, and there are still considerable remains of the old wall, including a handsome Gothic structure, known as the “South Gates.” The streets are generally narrow and winding; some of the dwelling-houses are very ancient. The public walks form a fine promenade, and in the centre of them stands a quaint octagonal chapel called the Red Mount, at one time much frequented by pilgrims. The church of St Margaret’s, formerly the priory church, is a fine Gothic building with two towers at the west end, one of which was formerly surmounted by a spire blown down in 1741. St Nicholas chapel, at the north end of the town, is also of mediaeval date, and contains many interesting memorials of the past. All Saints church is a beautiful and ancient cruciform structure. At the grammar school, founded in the reign of Henry VIII., Eugene Aram was at one time usher. There are also national schools, a British school, and several charities. Among the other public buildings are the guildhall, with Renaissance porch, the corn exchange, the custom-house, and the athenaeum. The shipping trade is steadily progressing, and there is now regular steam communication with Hamburg. The principal exports are corn, wool, and oilcake, and the principal imports, coal, timber, linseed, and manufactured goods. The total value of the exports in 1880 was <£1,152,456, the average for the four years 1876-79 being £967,958, and for four years 1872-75 £519,479. The value of the exports in 1880 was £366,649, the average value for 1876-79 being £251,491, and for 1872-75 £140,974. The Alexandra dock, opened in 1869, has a water area of 6∣ acres, with an average depth of 31 feet. The fisheries of the town are important, and there are also breweries, corn-mills, iron and brass foundries, agricultural implement manufactories, shipbuilding yards, rope and sail works, and tobacco manufactories. The population of the borough in 1871 was 16,562, and in 1881 it was 18,475.

Lynn is supposed to have been a British town, and was known as a port before the Norman invasion, after which it became the possession of the bishops of Norwich, and was known as Lynn Episcopi. After the suppression of the monasteries it came into the hands of Henry VIII., and its name was changed to Lynn Regis or King’s Lynn. The town was taken by the parliamentary forces in 1643. It received its first charter from King John, but its first governing charter from Henry VIII. Since the 23d of Edward I. it has returned two members to parliament.
