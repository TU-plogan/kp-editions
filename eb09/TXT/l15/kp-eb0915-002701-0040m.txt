LOVAT, Simon Fraser, Baron, a famous Jacobite intriguer, executed for the part which he took in the rebellion of 1745, was born about the year 1676, and was the second son of Thomas, afterwards twelfth Lord Lovat. He was educated at King’s College, Aberdeen, and there seems reason to believe that he was there no negligent student, as his correspondence afterwards gives abundant proof, not only of a thorough command of good English and idiomatic French, but of such an acquaintance with the Latin classics as to leave him never at a loss for an apt quotation from Virgil or Horace. Whether Lovat ever felt any real principle of loyalty to the Stuarts or was actuated throughout merely by what he supposed to be self-interest it is difficult to determine, but that he was a born traitor and deceiver there can be no doubt. One of his first acts on leaving college was to recruit three hundred men from his clan to form part of a regiment in the service of William and Mary, in which he himself was to hold a command,— his object being, as he unhesitatingly avows, to have a body of well-trained soldiers under his influence, whom at a moment’s notice he might carry over to the interest of King James. Among other wild outrages in which he was engaged about this time was a rape and forced marriage committed on the widow of a previous Lord Lovat with the view apparently of securing his own succession to the estates; and it is a curious instance of his plausibility and power of influencing others that, after being subjected by him to the most horrible ill-usage, the woman is said to have ultimately become seriously attached to him. A prosecution for his violence, however, having been instituted against him by Lady Lovat’s family, Simon found it prudent to retire first to his native strongholds in the Highlands, and afterwards to France, where he at length found his way in July 1702 to the court of St Germains. One of his first steps towards gaining influence there seems to have been to announce his conversion to the Catholic faith. He then proceeded to put the great project of restoring the exiled family into a practical shape. Hitherto nothing seems to have been known among the Jacobite exiles of the efficiency of the Highlanders as a military force. But Lovat, who was of course well acquainted with their capabilities, saw that, as they were the only part of the British population accustomed to the independent use of arms, they could be at once put in action against the reigning power. His plan therefore was to land five thousand French troops at Dundee, where they might reach the north-eastern passes of the Highlands in a day’s march, and be in a position to divert the British troops till the Highlands should have time to rise. Immediately afterwards five hundred men were to land on the west coast, seize Fort Wilfiam or Inverlochy, and thus prevent the access of any military force from the south to the central Highlands. The whole scheme affords strong indication of Lovat’s sagacity as a military strategist, and it is observable that his plan is that which was continuously kept in view in all the future attempts of the Jacobites, and finally acted on in the last outbreak of 1745. The advisers of the Pretender seem to have been either slow to trust their astute coadjutor or slow to comprehend his project. At last, however, he was despatched on a secret mission to the Highlands to sound those of the chiefs who were likely to rise, and to ascertain what forces they could bring into the field. He very soon found, however, that there was little disposition to join the rebellion, and he then made up his mind to secure his own safety by revealing all that he knew to the Government of Queen Anne. Having by this means obtained a pardon for all his previous crimes, he was sent back to France to act as a spy on the Jacobites. On returning to Paris suspicions soon got afloat as to his proceedings, and in the end he was committed close prisoner in the castle of Angoulême, where he remained for nearly ten years, or till November 1714, when he made his escape to England. For some twenty-five years after this he was chiefly occupied in lawsuits for the recovery of his estates and the re-establishment of his fortune, in both of which objects he was successful. The intervals of his leisure were filled up by Jacobite and Anti-Jacobite intrigues, in which he seems to have alternately, as suited his interests, acted the traitor to both parties. But he so far obtained the confidence of the Government as to have secured the appointments of sheriff of Inverness and of colonel of an independent company. His disloyal practices, however, soon led to his being suspected; and he was deprived of both his appointments. When the rebellion of 1745 broke out, Lovat acted with his characteristic duplicity. He represented to the Jacobites—what was probably in the main true—that though eager for their success his weak health and advanced years prevented him from joining the standard of the prince in person, while to the Lord President Forbes he professed his cordial attachment to the existing state of things, but lamented that his headstrong son, in spite of all his remonstrances, had insisted on joining the Pretender, and succeeded in taking with him a strong force from the clan of the Frasers. The truth was that the poor [9:15:28] lad was most unwilling to go out, but was compelled by his father to do so. Lovat’s false professions of fidelity did not of course long deceive the Government, and after the battle of Culloden he was obliged to retreat to some of the wildest recesses of the Highlands, after seeing from a distant height his proud castle of Dounie delivered to the flames by the royal army. Even then, however, broken down by disease and old age, carried about on a litter and unable to move without assistance, his mental resources did not fail him; and in a conference with several of the Jacobite leaders he proposed that they should raise a body of three thousand men, which would be enough to make their mountains impregnable, and at length force the Government to give them advantageous terms. The project, though by no means a chimerical one, was not carried out, and Lovat, after enduring incredible hardships in his wanderings, was at last arrested on an island in Loch Morar close upon the west coast. He was conveyed in a litter to London, and after a trial of five days sentence of death in “the ordinary brutal form peculiar to England” was pronounced upon him on the 19th of March 1747. His execution took place on the 9th of April following. His conduct to the last was dignified and even cheerful,—his humour, his power of s ιrcasm, and his calm defiance of fate never deserting him. Just before submitting his head to the block he repeated the line from Horace—

“Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori.”
