LUSTRATION is a term that includes all the methods of purification and expiation among the Greeks and Romans. Among the Greeks there are two ideas clearly distinguishable—that human nature must purify itself from guilt before it is fit to enter into communion with God or even to associate with men (καθαιρώ, κάθαρσή, and that guilt must be expiated voluntarily by certain processes which God has revealed in order to avoid the punishment that must otherwise overtake it (ίλασ/zôç). It is not possible to make such a distinction among the Latin terms lustratio, piacula, piamenta, caerimoniae, and even among the Greeks it is not consistently observed. The conception of sin never reached a high moral standard, and the methods of lustration are purely ritualistic. Guilt and [9:15:70] impurity arose in various ways; among the Greeks, besides the general idea that man is always in need of purification, the species of guilt most insisted on by religion are incurred by murder, by touching a dead body, by sexual intercourse, and by seeing a prodigy or sign of the divine will. The last three of these spring from the idea that man had been without preparation and in an improper manner brought into communication with God, and was therefore guilty. The first, which involves a really moral idea of _ guilt, is far more important than the others in Hellenic religion. Among the Romans we hear more of the last species of impurity; in general the idea takes the form that after some great disaster the people become convinced that some guilt has been incurred somewhere and must be expiated. The methods of purification consist in ceremonies performed with water, fire, air, or earth, or with a branch of a sacred tree, especially of the laurel, and also in sacrifice and other ceremonial. Before entering a temple the worshipper dipped his hand in the vase of holy water {τrepLppavτηpcov, a(∕ua lustralis) which stood at the door; before a sacrifice bathing was a common kind of purification; salt-water was more efficacious than fresh, and the celebrants of the Eleusinian mysteries bathed in the sea (dλαδε μvστai) ; the water was more efficacious if a firebrand from the altar were plunged in it. The torch, fire, and sulphur (to θeiov) were also powerful purifying agents. Purification by air was most frequent in the Dionysiac mysteries; puppets suspended and swinging in the air {oscilla) formed one way of using the lustrative power of the air. Rubbing with sand and salt was another excellent method. The sacrifice chiefly used for purification by the Greeks was a pig; among the Romans it was always, except in the Lupercalia, a pig, a sheep, and a bull {suovetaurilia). In Athens a purificatory sacrifice and prayer was held before every public meeting; the Maimacteria in honour of Zeus Meilichios was an annual festival of purification, and several other feasts had the same character. On extraordinary occasions lustrations were performed for a whole city. So Athens was purified by Epimenides after the Cylonian massacre, and Delos in the Peloponnesian War. In Rome, besides such annual ceremonies as the Ambarvalia, Lupercalia, Cerealia, Paganalia, <tc., there was a lustration of the fleet before it sailed, and of the army before it marched. Part of the ceremonial always consisted in leading or carrying the victims round the impure persons or things. After any disaster the lustratio classium or xxercitus was often again performed, so as to make certain that the gods got all their due. The Amburbium was a similar ceremonial performed for the whole city on occasions of great danger or calamity. Ambilustrium was the purificatory ceremony, consisting in sacrifice and prayer, performed after the regular quinquennial census of the Roman pèople.
