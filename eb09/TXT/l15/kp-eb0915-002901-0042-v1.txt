LOVER, Samuel (1797-1868), novelist, artist, songwriter, and musician, was born in Dublin in 1797. His father was a member of the stock exchange. Lover began life as an artist, and was elected an academician of the Royal Hibernian Society of Arts—a body of which he afterwards became secretary. He acquired repute as a miniature painter; and a number of the local aristocracy sat to him for their portraits. His love for music showed itself at a very early age. At a dinner given to the poet Moore in 1818 Lover sang one of his own songs, which elicited special praise from Moore. One of his best known portraits was that of Paganini, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy. He attracted attention as an author by his Legends and Stories of Ireland (1832), and was one of the first writers for the Dublin University Magazine. He went to London about 1835, where, among others, he painted Lord Brougham in his robes as lord chancellor. His varied gifts rendered him very popular in society; and he appeared often at Lady Blessington’s evening receptions. There he sang several of his songs, which were so well received that he published them {Songs and Ballads, 1839). Some of them illustrated Irish superstitions, among these being “Rory O’More,” “The Angel’s Whisper,” “The May Dew,” and “The Fourleaved Shamrock.” In 1837 appeared Rory O'More, a National Romance, which at once made him a great reputation as a novelist; he afterwards dramatized it for the Adelphi Theatre, London. In 1842 was published his best known work, Handy Andy, an Irish Tale. Meanwhile his multifarious pursuits had seriously affected his health; andin 1814 he gave up writing for some time, substituting instead public entertainments, called by him “Irish Evenings,” illustrative of his own worksand his powers as a musician and composer. These were very successful both in Great Britain and in America. In addition to publishing numerous songs of his own, Lover edited a collection entitled The Lyrics of Ireland, which appeared in 1858. He died on July 6, 1868. Lover was remarkable for his versatility; but his fame rests mainly on his songs and novels; the latter are full of sunny Irish humour, and teem with felicitous pictures of national life. Besides those already mentioned he wrote Treasure Trove (1844), and Metrical Tales and Other Poems (1860).
