LUCKENWALDE, a busy little town of Prussia, in the province of Brandenburg, district of Potsdam, lies on the river Nuthe and on the Berlin and Anhalt Railway, 30 miles to the south-west of Berlin. Its cloth and wool manufactories are among the most extensive in Prussia, and it also contains cotton-printing works, dye-works, machine shops, and numerous other industrial establishments. The population in 1880 was 14,706. The site of Luckenwalde was occupied in the 12th century by a Cistercian monastery, but the village did not spring up till the reign of Frederick the Great. It was made a town in 1808.
