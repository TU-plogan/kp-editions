LUDLOW, a municipal and parliamentary borough and market-town of Shropshire, England, is situated at the junction of the Teme and Corve on the borders of Herefordshire, 27 miles south-east from Shrewsbury and 10 north from Leominster. The old castle, on an eminence above the Teme, presents an imposing and massive appearance, the Norman towers and the greater part of the walls being [9:15:59] still complete. The parish church of St Lawrence, a fine cruciform structure in the Gothic style, with a lofty central tower, dates from the reign of Edward III.; it was restored in 1859-60. The grammar school, founded in the reign of John, was incorporated by Edward I. The other principal public buildings are the guild-hall, the town-hall and market-house, and the public rooms, which include the assembly-rooms and a museum of natural history. Tanning and malting are carried on to a small extent, and there are also flour-mills. The population of the municipal borough (280 acres) in 1871 was 5087, and in 1881 5035. The population of the parliamentary borough (1371 acres) in the same years was 6203 and 6663.

Ludlow is said to have existed as a British town under the name of Dinan. After the Conquest it was granted to Roger de Montgomery, who is said to have been the founder of the castle. For some time the castle was a royal residence, and from the reign of Henry VIII. to that of William III. it was the seat of the council of the marches. In the reign of Charles I. it was garrisoned for the king, but it surrendered to the parliamentary forces in June 1646. The town had a charter of incorporation at a very early period, which was confirmed by Edward IV.
