LUTON, a market-town and municipal borough of Bedfordshire, England, is situated in a fine valley near the source of the Lea, 31 miles north-west of London. The parish church of St Mary, dating from the 14th century, a very fine building in the Decorated Norman and Later English styles, contains a large number of old monuments and brasses. Its entire length is 182 feet, the width of nave and aisles 57 feet, and the width of the transepts from north to south 101 feet. On the process of restoration, begun in 1865, Â£6000 has been expended. The other principal public buildings are the town-hall, the corn exchange, the court-house, and the plait hall. Luton is the principal, seat of the straw-plait manufacture in England. The industry originated in the colony of straw-plaiters transplanted by James I. from Scotland, whither they had been brought from Lorraine by Queen Mary. Though the town is very ancient, it was first incorporated in February 1876. The population, which in 1871 was 17,317, was 23,959 in 1881.
