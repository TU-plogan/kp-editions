LUNÉVILLE, the chief place of an arrondissement in the department of Meurthe and Moselle, France, 240 miles east of Paris by rail on the line to Strasburg, stands in the midst of meadows between the Meurthe and the Vezouze a little above their confluence. It is a handsome town regularly built. The chateau, designed early in the 18th century by the royal architect Boffrand, was the favourite residence of Duke Leopold of Lorraine, where he gathered round him the academy composed of eminent men of the district. It is npw a cavalry barrack. Lunéville has always been an important cavalry station, and has a riding school where two hundred horsemen can exercise at the same time. The church of St Jacques, with its two towers, dates from the same period as the chateau. The church of St Maur, in the Byzantine style, is but thirty years old. The district round Lunéville is mainly agricultural, and the town has a fine corn exchange. The manufactures include pottery, embroideries, gloves, cotton cloth, and cooking stoves. There are starch works and gypsum kilns, and a considerable trade in grain, flour, hops, and other agricultural produce. The population in 1876 was 16,041.

The name of Lunéville is derived from an ancient cult of Diana. A sacred fountain and medals with the effigy of this goddess have been found at Leormont, some 2 miles east of the town. Lunéville formed part of Austrasia, and after various changes fell to the crown of Lorraine. A walled town in the Middle Ages, it suffered in the Thirty Years’ War and in the campaigns of Louis XIV. from war and its consequences—plague and famine. The town flourished again under Dukes Leopold and Stanislas, on the death of the latter of whom, which took place at Lunéville, Lorraine was united to France (1766). The treaty of Lunéville between France and Austria (1801) confirmed the former power in the possession of the left bank of the Rhine. The town was the birthplace of the emperor Francis, husband of Maria Theresa, and of the painter Jean Girardet.
