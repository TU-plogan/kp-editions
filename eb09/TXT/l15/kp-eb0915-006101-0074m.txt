LUGOS, a market-town of Hungary, capital of the trans-Tisian county of Krassô, is situated on the Ternes, and on the railway from Temesvâr to Karânsebes, 32 miles east-south-east of the former, in 45° 4Γ N. lat., 21° 53' E. long. The two main portions of the town, separated by the river, and named respectively Német- (German) Lugos and Rom<4n- (Roumanian) Lugos, are connected by a wooden bridge 312 feet in length. Lugos is the seat of a Greek Catholic (Roumanian) bishopric, of royal and circuit courts of law, and of the usual bureaus of a county administration. The public and other buildings include Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman Catholic, and Lutheran churches, a synagogue, a royal upper gymnasium (founded in 1823), a Minorite convent, an episcopal palace, the barracks, and the ruins of a castle. The surrounding country is mountainous and well-wooded, and produces large quantities of grapes and plums. In 1880 the population was 11,287, of whom 3476, chiefly Germans, were in Német-Lugos, and 7811, Roumanians, with a few Slavonians and Magyars, in Român-Lugos.

Lugos was once a strong fortress and of greater relative importance than at present. During the 16th and 17th centuries it suffered much at the hands of the Turks. At the close of the Hungarian revolutionary war (August 1849) it was the last resort of Kossuth and several other leaders of the national cause previous to their escape to Turkey.
