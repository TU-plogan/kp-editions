LYRA, Nicolaus de (c. 1270-1340), a well-known mediaeval commentator, was a native of Lyre, near Evreux, Normandy, and was born most probably about 1270; at least he was still young when in 1291 he entered the l·ranciscan order at Verneuil. He afterwards studied at Paris, and became doctor of theology and a successful teacher there. In 1325 he became provincial of his order for Burgundy; and on October 23, 1340, he died at Paris.

Lyra (Lyranus) was the author of a controversial treatise against the Jews, entitled De Messia, (jusque eudwentu praeterito, and of a Tractatus de idoneo ministrante et suscipiente sancti altaris sacramentum, but by far his most important work is the Postillae perpetvae, sice brecia commentaria in universa Biblia, first printed at Rome (5 vols, fol., 1471-72), and often subsequently. It may be said to mark the first beginnings of a school of natural exegesis; for, though recognizing the old doctrine of a fourfold sense—

“Litera gesta docet, quid credas allegoria, Moralis quid agas, quo tendas anagogia ”—

Lyra explicitly maintained and sought to give effect to the principle that the foundation of every mystical exposition must first be firmly laid by ascertaining the literal meaning. His qualities as an interpreter of Scripture included, besides comparative freedom from dogmatic prepossession, a good knowledge of Hebrew and a fair acquaintance with Greek. Luther was acquainted with his commentaries, and it is through the influence of Rashi upon Lyra that so many traces of the exegesis of that rabbi are found in Luther’s writings; hence the oft-quoted saying, “Si Lyra non lyrasset, Lutherιιs non saltasset.” See vol. xi. p. 601.
