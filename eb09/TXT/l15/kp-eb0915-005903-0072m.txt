LUDWIGSBURG, the second royal residence of Wurtemberg, is situated 9 miles to the north of Stuttgart and 1∣ miles from the Neckar. It was laid out at the beginning of last century by Duke Eberhard Ludwig as a rival to Stuttgart, and was greatly enlarged by Duke Charles, who resided there from 1764 to 1785. Constructed as the adjunct of a palace, the town bears the impress of its artificial origin, and its straight streets and spacious squares have a dull and lifeless appearance. Its main importance now consists in its being the chief military depot of Würtemberg, as which it contains extensive barracks, a cannon foundry, an arsenal, and a military academy. The royal palace, one of the largest and finest ⅛ Germany, stands in a beautiful park, and contains a portrait-gallery and the burial vault of the sovereigns of Würtemberg. Among the other prominent buildings are four churches and several educational and charitable institutions. Ludwigsburg also carries on manufactures of organs, woollen and linen cloth, japanned tin-wares, picture frames, and chicory. In 1880 it contained 16,100 inhabitants, about one-fourth of whom belonged to the [9:15:60] garrison. David Strauss, author of the Life of Jesus, was a native of Ludwigsburg. In the vicinity is the beautiful royal chateau of Monrepos, connected with the park of Ludwigsburg by a fine avenue of limes.
