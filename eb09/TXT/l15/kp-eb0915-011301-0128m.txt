LYONS, Edmund Lyons, Lord (1790-1858), British admiral, was descended from a family connected with Antigua, and previously with Cork, and was born at Burton near Christchurch, Hampshire, 21st November 1790. He entered the navy at an early age, and served in the Mediterranean, and afterwards in the East Indies, where in 1810 he won promotion by distinguished bravery. He became post-captain in 1814,and in 1828 commanded the “Blonde” frigate at the blockade of Navarino. He took part with the French in the capture of the castle of Morea, receiving for his conduct the orders of St Louis of France and of the Redeemer of Greece. Shortly before his ship was paid off in 1835 he was knighted. From 1840 till the outbreak of hostilities with Russia Lyons was employed on the diplomatic service, being minister plenipotentiary to the court of Greece until 1849, then until 1851 ambassador to the Swiss cantons, whence he was transferred to a similar position at Stockholm. On the outbreak of the war with Russia he was appointed second in command of the British fleet in the Black Sea under Admiral Dundas, whom he succeeded in the chief command in 1854. As admiral of the inshore squadron he had the direction of the landing of the troops in the Crimea, which he conducted with marvellous energy and despatch. According to Kinglake, Lyons shared the “intimate counsels” of Lord Raglan in regard to the most momentous questions of the war, and throughout the Crimean campaign he toiled, with a “painful consuming passion,” to guard against disaster, to clear away overpowering difficulties and obstacles, and to win the final purpose of the expedition. His actual achievements in battle were principally two—the support he rendered with his guns to the French at the Alma in attacking the left flank of the Russians, and the bold and brilliant part he took with his ship the “Agamemnon” in the first bombardment of the forts of Sebastopol; but his constant vigilance, his multifarious activity, and his suggestions and counsels were much more advantageous to the allied cause than his specific exploits. In 1855 he was created vice-admiral, and at the conclusion of the war he was, in June 1856, raised to the peerage with the title of Lord Lyons of Christchurch. He died November 23, 1858.
