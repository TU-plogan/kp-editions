LOZÈRE, a department of south-eastern France, but belonging to the great central plateau, is composed of almost the whole of Gévaudan and of some parishes of the old dioceses of Alais and Uzès, districts all formerly included in the province of Languedoc. It lies between 44° 6' and 44° 58' N. lat., and between 2° 58' and 4° E. long., and is bounded on the N.W. by Cantal, on the N.E. by Haute-Loire, on the E. by Ardèche, on the S.E. by Gard, and on the S.W. by Aveyron, having an extreme length of 65 miles, an extreme breadth of 50, and an area of 1996 square miles. Lozère is mountainous throughout, and its average elevation makes it the highest of all the French departments. It has three distinct regions—the Cevennes to the south-east, the “causses” to the southwest, and the mountain tracts which occupy the rest. The Cevennes, forming the watershed between the Garonne and Loire basins to the west and that of the Rhone to the east, begin (within Lozère) with Mount Aigoual, which rises to a height of more than 5100 feet; parallel to this are the mountains of Bougés, a range between the rivers Tarn and Tarnon, bold and bare on its southern face, but falling gently away with wooded slopes toward the north. To the north of the Tarn is the range of Lozère, including the peak of Finiels, the highest point of the department (5584 feet). Further on occurs the broad marshy plateau of Montbel, from which the water drains southward to the Lot, northwards to the Allier, eastward by the Chassezac to the Ardèche. From this plateau extend the mountains of La Margeride, a long series of undulating granitic tablelands partly clothed with woods of oak, beech, and fir, and partly covered with pastures, to which the flocks are brought up from lower Languedoc in summer. The highest point (Mount de Randon) is 5098 feet. Adjoining the Margeride hills on the west is the volcanic range of Aubrac, an extensive pastoral district where horned cattle take the place of sheep; the highest point is 4826 feet. The “causses” of Lozère, having an area of about 483 square miles, consist of extensive calcareous tracts, fissured and arid, but separated from each other by deep and well-watered gorges, whose freshness and beauty are in pleasant contrast with the desolate aspect of the plateaus. The “causse” of Sauveterre, between the Lot and the Tarn, ranges from 3000 to 3300 feet in height; that of Méjean has nearly the same average altitude, but has peaks some 1000 feet higher. Between these two “causses” the Tarn flows through a series of landscapes which are among the most picturesque and grand in France. The Lot and the Tarn, the two most important tributaries of the Garonne, both have their sources in this department, as also have the Allier, the two Gardons, which unite to form the Gard, the Cèze, and the Chassezac with its affluent the Altier. The climate of Lozère varies greatly with the locality. The mean temperature of Mende, the capital, is below that of Paris; that of the mountains is always low, but in the “causses” the summer is scorching and the winter severe; in the Cevennes the climate becomes mild enough at their base (656 feet) to permit the growth of the olive. Rain falls in violent storms, causing disastrous floods. On the Mediterranean versant there are 78 , 7 inches, in the Garonne basin 45 , 5, and in that of the Loire only 27 , 95. The general character of the department is pastoral; only onefourth of the area is occupied by arable land; 91,500 acres are meadow, 155,700 wood, and 90,000 chestnut plantation. The number of sheep (which is doubled in summer) is 300,000; there are 50,000 head of cattle; and pigs, goats, horses, asses, and mules are also reared. Bees are also kept, and, among the Cevennes, silkworms. The export of chestnuts from the Cevennes is considerable. Rye is the chief cereal; but oats, wheat, meslin, barley, and many potatoes are also grown. Great care is bestowed on cultivation in the valleys adjoining the Ardèche; fruit trees and leguminous plants are irrigated by small canals (“béais ”) on terraces which have been made or are maintained with much labour. The department yields argentiferous lead (Villefort), slates, and mineral waters, among which those of Bagnols are most frequented. The exportation of its antimony, manganese, marble, and lithographic stones is undeveloped as yet. The tufa of Mende is well adapted for building purposes. The manufactures are unimportant. The population in 1876 was 138,319, having decreased by 5000 since 1801, and by a still greater number since the end of the 17th century. There are about 20,000 Protestants. The arrondissements are three (Mende, Florae, and Marvejols), the cantons twenty-four, and the communes one hundred and ninety-six. .. *
