LYNN, a city in Essex county, Massachusetts, U.S., situated near the north end of Massachusetts Bay, on a harbour formed by the peninsula of Nahant, 10 miles north-east of Boston, with which it is connected by different lines of railway. The bulk of Lynn is built on the low grounds near the sea; but in the north-east the elevation is greater, and behind the city proper there is a range of porphyritic hills dotted with villas. Most of the houses are of wood, those of the main thoroughfare—Market Street—of brick. The city hall, a substantial erection of brick and brown stone, is considered one of the finest buildings of its class in New England. It contains the free public library, founded in 1862, and numbering 29,126 volumes in 1880. It was at Lynn that the first smelting-works in this part of the country were established, in 1643; but the place has long been famous rather for the making of boots and shoes, a department, indeed, in which it has hardly a rival in the world. This trade was introduced in 1750 by a Welshman, John Adam Dagyr; in 1767 the output was 80,000 pairs; in 1810, 1,000,000 pairs; in 1865, 5,360,000; in 1868 upwards of 10,000,000; and in 1880, 16,276,380,—the greater proportion being cheap shoes for women and children. About twelve thousand hands are employed, though labour-saving machinery is freely introduced. Another industry of great local importance is the tanning and dressing of sheep and goat skins, and the making of morocco leather. The population was 6138 in 1830, 14,257 in 1850, 28,233 in 1870, and 38,284 in 1880.

The foundation of the town belongs to 1629; and the name was given in memory of Lynn Regis in England, the home of its first pastor. It obtained incorporation as a city in 1850; Swampscott and Nahant, which it then included, were rendered independent in 1852 and 1853 respectively.
