LYMINGTON, a municipal and parliamentary borough and seaport town of Hampshire, England, is situated on the Lym at its entrance to the Solent opposite the Isle of Wight, 94 miles south-west of London and 15 south of Southampton. The parish church, dedicated to St Thomas Ã  Becket, is an irregular structure, dating from the reign of Henry VI., but frequently restored. There are two grammar schools and several charities. The manufacture of salt and of Epsom salts has been declining for some years. A building yard here has turned out some of the most famous racing yachts. In summer the town is much frequented for sea-bathing. Lymington in Domesday is called Lentune, changed afterwards to Limentum. It was a borough by prescription, and received a grant of incorporation from James I. From the 27th of Elizabeth till 1867 it returned two members to parliament, and it still returns one. The population of the municipal borough (141 acres) was 2431 in 1881, and that of the parliamentary borough (4769 acres) 5462.
