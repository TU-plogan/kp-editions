LYONS (French, Lyon), in political, commercial, industrial, and military importance, as well as in point of size, the second city of France, formerly the capital of Lyonnais, and now the chief town of the department of Rhone, seat of a court of appeal and of a military government, and a fortified place, is situated at the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône, in 45° 46' N. lat. and 4° 49' 19" E. long., at an altitude above the sea varying from 540 to rather more than 1000 feet. The population of the city and liberties in 1876 was 342,815. The rivers, both flowing south, are separated by the hill of Croix-Rousse. On the right the Saône is bordered by the scarped heights of Fourvières, St Irénée, and Ste Foy, leaving room only for the quaysand one or two narrow streets; this is the oldest part of the city. Where it enters Lyons the Saône has on its right the faubourg of Vaise and on its left that of

Serin, whence the ascent is made to the top of the hill of Croix-Rousse. The river next takes a semicircular sweep around the hill of Fourvières (410 feet above it), which is fully occupied by convents, hospitals, and seminaries, and has at its summit the famous church, the resort of 1,500,000 pilgrims annually. From this point the best view of the entire city is obtained. First the busy Saône is seen with its thirteen bridges and animated quays. Next, on the peninsula between the two rivers at the foot of the hill of Croix-Rousse, come the principal quarters of the town: the Terreaux, containing the hôtel de ville, the prefecture, and the chief commercial establishments; Bellecour with its large open square, one of the finest in Europe; and the aristocratic Quartier de Perrache. The Rhone and Saône formerly met here, till, a hundred years ago, the sculptor Perrache reclaimed from the rivers the quarter which bears his name; on the peninsula thus formed stands the principal railway station. Here too are the docks of the Saône, factories, the arsenal, gas-works, prisons, and the slaughter-house.
[9:15:111]

The Rhone, less confined than the Saône, flows swiftly in a wide channel, broken when the water is low in spring by pebbly islets. On the right hand it skirts first St Clair, sloping upwards to Croix-Rousse, and then the districts of Terreaux, Bellecour, and Perrache; on the left it has a low-lying plain, subject to disastrous inundations, occupied by the Parc de la Tête d’Or and the quarters of Brotteaux and Guillotière. The park, defended by the Grand Camp embankment, comprises 282 acres, and contains a zoological collection, botanical and pharmaceutical gardens, and the finest greenhouses in France, with unique collections of orchids, palm-trees, and Cycadaceae. Brotteaux is a modern town with boulevards and regular streets, and in this direction Lyons is extending every year. In the old districts there is no room for growth; they are crowded with old buildings of eight or ten stories, or even more, and it has been the task of the last thirty years to open them up by means of thoroughfares. Guillotière, to the south, is a workmen’s quarter of wretched houses.

The Rhone is lined with broad quays, and crossed by ten fine bridges, two of them for railway traffic. On the right bank stand the lycée and the public library, the Hôtel Dieu, the military hospital, and the Hospice de la Charité; on the left bank is the long range occupied by the medical faculty. In the east of Guillotière the Geneva railway skirts the artillery barracks.

Northward from Fourvières appear the green slopes of Mont d’Or, descending towards the Saône by pleasant glades sprinkled with villas; to the east, beyond the somewhat monotonous plain, stretch the mountains of Savoy and Dauphiné; to the south, below the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône, the river traverses a rich landscape to pass out of sight at the foot of Mont Pilat; and to the west the horizon is bounded by the Forez hills.

Since 1852 the communes of Croix-Rousse and Guillotière have been united with Lyons. The Rhone and the old fortifications, which, on the right bank of the Saône, stretched in an unbroken line from the rock of Pierre Seize below Vaise to the bridge of Ainay, continued by those now replaced by the Croix-Rousse boulevard, marked the boundaries of the ancient city. The line of Croix-Rousse has now been thrown forward to the north, and further strengthened by Forts Caluire and Montessuy. On the left bank of the Rhone stand Forts Tête d’Or, Charpennes, Brotteaux and Part-Dieu, Villeurbanne, Lamotte, Colombier, and Vitriolerie. On the right bank of the Saône Forts Ste Foy, St Irénée, Loyasse, Vaise, and Duchère completed the defensive system of Lyons previous to 1870; but since that date the dominant points of the neighbourhood have begun to be crowned with batteries and redoubts; but only Forts Brou and Feyzin on the left bank of the Rhone, St Genis on the right bank, Mont Verdun on Mont d’Or, and Vencia are finished.

Of the ancient buildings in Lyons, Fourvières is the one which attracts most visitors. It derives its name from the ancient forum (Porum vetus), whose site it occupies. The first chapel, dedicated to the Virgin, was erected in the end of the 9th century. Consecrated afterwards to St Thomas of Canterbury, and then made a collegiate church, Notre Dame de Fourvières was created superior of twenty-five villages by Louis XL, on occasion of his visit in 1476. Laid waste by the Protestants, plundered at the Revolution, it began to be visited again in 1804, and in 1805 Pope Pins VII., returning from the coronation of Napoleon, ascended thither to give his benediction to the city—a ceremony renewed from year to year with great pomp. The church tower, 172 feet high, is surmounted by a statue of the Virgin in gilded bronze, 18 feet high, turned towards the town; on the pedestal are bronze plates with inscriptions assigning to the Virgin the credit of ending the plague of 1643, and of preserving the town during the cholera epidemics of 1832, 1835, and 1850. The first stone of a magnificent new church was laid in 1872. The crypt, 219 feet by 62, is as yet the only portion finished. At the foot of Fourvières, on the right bank of the Saône, lies the metropolitan church of St John (the archbishop of Lyons is primate of all Gaul). The choir belongs to the early years, the transept to the close of the 12th century; the building of the nave, carried on during the next three hundred years, was completed only in 1480. In one of the two towers there is a bell weighing nearly 10 tons. To the right and left of the altar stand two crosses preserved since the council of 1274 as a symbol of the union then agreed upon between the Greek and Latin Churches. St Martin d’Ainay, in the Perrache quarter, is the oldest church in Lyons, dating from the beginning of the 6th century; the chapels of the apse are adorned by paintings by Flandrin. St Nizier, in the heart of the city, was the first cathedral of Lyons; and the crypt in which St Pothinus officiated still exists. The present church is a Gothic edifice of the 15th century, with the exception of the porch, constructed by Philibert Delorme. In the crypt of the church of St Irenaeus are the tomb of that saint and a vast quantity of bones, alleged to be those of 19,000 martyrs put to death in the persecution of Severus. The Place Bellecour is adorned west and east by two monumental façades briginally erected after plans by Mansard, but destroyed in 1793, and rebuilt under the consulate in a somewhat modified style. In the middle stands an equestrian statue of Louis XIV. by Lemot. The Rue de I’Hotel de Ville, connecting the Place Bellecour and the Place des Terreaux, and the Rue de la Republique running parallel with it are among the finest streets of the modern city. The east side of the Place des Terreaux (so called from the “terreaux” now occupying the place of the canal which formerly connected the Rhone and the Saône) is formed by the hôtel de ville, which, however, turns a better front in the opposite direction towards the theatre; the south is occupied by the Palais St Pierre (formerly a convent), which gives accommodation to the faculties of science and literature, and to the school of fine arts, the picture gallery, the museums of sculpture, archaeology and natural history, and the art library. In the Rue de la Republique, between Place de la Bourse and Place des Cordeliers, each of which contains one of its highly ornamented fronts, stands the building occupied by the exchange and the commercial court. The former has its offices on the ground floor round the central glass-roofed hall; besides the court, the upper stories accommodate the council of prud’hommes, the chamber of commerce, and the industrial museum. The palais de justice, a fine building with a Corinthian colonnade, on the right bank of the Saône, occupies the site of the palace of the counts of Forez. A statue of Jacquart the inventor stands in Place Sathonay, and one of Marshal Suchet in Place Tholozan.

The Academy of Lyons has the five faculties of Catholic theology, science, literature, medicine and pharmacy, and law, with two lyceums, and a number of schools; and the Catholic institute has three faculties—law, science, and theology. The school of fine arts was founded in the 18th century to train competent designers for the textile manufactures, but has also done much for painting and sculpture. The veterinary school of Lyons, instituted in 1761, was the first of its kind in Europe; its laboratory for the study of comparative physiology is admirably equipped. L’École la Martinière (founded by the legacy of Claude Martin) furnishes gratuitous teaching of the sciences and industrial arts. The school of commerce and the Lyons central school complete the list of institutions for industrial education.
[9:15:112]

Besides the Académie des Sciences, Belles Lettres, et Arts (founded in 1700), Lyons possesses societies of agriculture, natural history, useful arts and sciences, geography, and horticulture.

The Hôtel Dieu, instituted in the beginning of the 6th century by King Childebert, is still one of the chief establishments of its kind in the city, and contains 929 beds. Its façade, fronting the Quai du Rhone for 1060 feet, was commenced according to the designs of Soufflot, architect of the Pantheon at Paris. The Hospice de la Charité and the military hospital are a little larger than the Hôtel Dieu. The Hospice de l’Antiquaille, at Fourvières (2000 beds), occupies the site of the ancient palace of the praetorian prefects, in which Germanicus, Claudius, and Caracalla were born. Lyons has many other benevolent institutions, and is also the centre of the operations of the Propagation de la Foi.

The museum is one of the best provincial collections in France, alike in its ancient, mediaeval, and modern departments. Among the Gallo-Roman inscriptions, in which it is particularly rich, are the bronze tables discovered at Lyons in 1528, which contain the speech of the emperor Claudius in regard to the admission of the citizens of Gallia Comata into the Roman senate. The numismatic collection (30,000 pieces) includes a series of the coins struck at Lyons from 43 b.c. to 1857. There is a special gallery of works of Lyonese painters; and the Bernard collection of about 300 pictures is kept entire.

The museum of natural history (for which a new building is to be erected in the Parc de la Tête d’Or) contains a zoological department ranking next to that of Paris, and mineralogical, geological, and anthropological sections— the last enriched with specimens from the classic site of Solutré (Saône and Loire). The museum of art and industries, founded in 1864 by the chamber of commerce, is divided into three sections, the first intended to illustrate the various conceptions of the beautiful formed by different peoples, the second to show the whole method of the textile industry, and the third to give an historical conspectus of woven textures. The Guimet Museum, in a special building in the Tête d’Or, consists of objects brought from the extreme East (mainly by M. Emile Guimet) and designed to facilitate the comparative study of religions, especially those of the Eastern world. Since 1880 the institution has published its Annales, consisting of original essays or translations of foreign works.

The library of the school of arts contains 65,000 volumes and 22,000 engravings, and the town library 108,000 volumesand 1300 manuscripts,—about 600 of the printed works being incunabula, and 25 of the MSS. belonging to the Carlovingian period. In the latter institution is the great terrestrial globe made at Lyons in 1701, indicating the great African lakes, the rediscovery of which has been one of the events of the present century.

Under the Romans Lyons was admirably provided with water. Three ancient aqueducts on the Fourvières level, from Montroman, Mont d’Or, and Mont Pilat, can still be traced; and the last was no less than 52 miles long, and capable of supplying 11,000,000 gallons per day. Magnificent remains of this work may be seen at St Irénée and Chaponost. Traces also exist along the Rhone of a subterranean canal conveying the water of the river to a naumachia. At present the water supply of Lyons is obtained from the Rhone by powerful hydraulic engines situated above the town, which raise the water to the Montessuyand the Fourvières plateaus, 456 feet above the low level of the river. The reservoirs are capable of supplying 1,765,829 cubic feet of water per day.

Agrippa made Lyons the starting-point of the principal Roman roads throughout Gaul; and it still remains an important centre in the general system of communication. The Saône above the town and the Rhone below have large barge and steamboat traffic; and the latter river above the town may be used by steamboats during summer as far as Aix in Savoy. Navigation, however, is often interrupted, even below the town, by the lowness of the water, and a canal is projected to remedy this defect. The current of the Saône is less rapid than that of the Rhone, and is controlled by weirs.

The railway from Paris to Marseilles has two stations (Vaise and Perrache) in Lyons; and the line from Lyons to Geneva two (Brotteaux and St Clair). The Montbrison line starts from St Paul, on the right of the Saône. The terminus of Part-Dieu for the newly-opened East of Lyons line is between Perrache and Brotteaux. Within the town there are two rope railways,—the first mounting to Fourvières, and the second, popularly called the ficelle, from Rue Terme to Croix-Rousse.

In a city of such importance as Lyons the number of industries is naturally large, but by far the most extensive of them all is the silk manufacture. Derived from Italy, this industry rapidly developed under the patronage of Francis I., Henry II., and Henry IV.; and from time to time new kinds of fabrics were invented—silk stuffs woofed with wool or with gold and silver threads, shawls, watered silks, poplins, velvets, satinades, moires, Arc. In the beginning of the present century Jacquart introduced his famous loom by which a single workman was enabled to produce elaborate fabrics as easily as the plainest web, and by changing the “cartoons” to make the most different textures on the same looms. In the 17th century the silk manufacture employed at Lyons 9000 to 12,000 looms. After the revocation of the edict of Nantes the number sank to 3000 or 4000; but after the Reign of Terror was past it rose again about 1801 to 12,000. At present there are about 70,000 in operation when no great commercial crisis comes to diminish production, giving employment to about 140,000 weavers. There are also a large number of persons engaged in the silk-worm hatcheries established in I’rance. The workmen live for the most part in the Croix-Rousse quarter, but many of them inhabit the outskirts. The mean annual value of the silk goods manufactured is estimated at 375,000,000 francs (£15,000,000),—250,000,000 representing the value of the raw material and 125,000,000 the value of the labour. Including the purchase of raw materials and the sale of the manufactured goods, the silk trade gives a total turnover of 1000 million francs (£40,000,000). A special office (known as La Condition des Soies) determines the weight and nature of the silk. Extensive dye-works, chemical works, breweries, pork factories, engineering works, printing establishments, and hat factories represent the secondary industries of the place. A large trade is carried on in chestnuts brought from the neighbouring departments, and known as marrons de Lyon.

The earliest Gallic occupants of the territory at the confluence of the Rhone and the Saône were the Segusians. In 59 b.c., some Greek refugees from the banks of the Hérault, having obtained permission of the natives to establish themselves beside the Croix Rousse, called their new town by the Gallic name Lugdunum; and in 43 b.c. Munatius Plancus brought a Roman colony to Fourvières from Vienne. This settlement soon acquired importance, and was made by Agrippa the starting point of four great roads. Augustus, besides building aqueducts, temples, and a theatre, gave it a senate and made it the seat of an annual assembly of deputies from the sixty cities of Gallia Comata. Under the emperors the colony of Forum Vetus and the municipium of Lugdunum were united, receiving the/ws scηαtus. The town was burnt by Nero in 59 A.τ>., and afterwards rebuilt by him in a much finer style; it was also adorned by Trajan, Adrian, and Antoninus. The martyrdom of Pothinus and Blandina occurred under Marcus Aurelius (177 A.τ>.), and in 197 a still more savage persecution of the Christians took place under Septimius Severus, in which Irenaeus, according to [9:15:113] some authors, perished. After having been ravaged by the barbarians and abandoned by the empire, Lyons in 478 became capital of the kingdom of the Burgundians. It afterwards fell into the hands of the Franks, and suffered severely from the Saracens, but revived under Charlemagne, and after the death of Charles the Bald was made the capital of the kingdom of Provence. From 1024 it was a fief of the emperor of Germany. Subsequently the superioιity over the town was a subject of dispute between the archbishops of Lyons and the counts of Forez; but the royal supremacy was finally established under Louis IX. and Philip the Handseme. The citizens were constituted into a commune ruled by freely elected consuls (1320). In the 13th century two ecclesiastical councils were held at Lyons—one in 1245, presided over by Innocent 1V., at which the emperor Fre<leriek II. was deposed; the second, the oecumenical, under the presidency of Gregory X., in 1274, at which five hundred bishops met. Pope Clement V. was crowned here in 1305, and his successor John XXII. elected in 1316. The Protestants obtained possession of the place in 1562; their acts of violence were fiercely avenged in 1572 after the St Bartholomew massacre. Under Henry III. Lyons sided with the League; but it pronounced in favour of Henry IV. In 1793 it rose against the Convention, but was compelled to yield to the army of the republic after enduring a siege of seven weeks (October 10). Terrible chastisement ensued: the name of Lyons was changed to that of Ville-affr anchie; thedenroli-tion of its buildings was set about on a wholesale scale; and vast numbers of the proscribed, whom the scaffold had spared, were butchered with grape shot. The town resumed its old name after the fall of Robespierre, and the terrorists in their turn were drowned in large numbers in the Rhone. Napoleon rebuilt the Place Bellecour, reopened the churches, and made the bridge of Tilsitt over the Saône between Bellecour and the cathedral. In 1814-15 Lyons was occupied by the Austrians, under the government of Louis Philippe, and in 1870-71 there were several bloody émeutes; in 1856 a disastrous flood laid waste the Brotteaux and rendered 20,000 persons homeless. An international exhibition was held here in 1872. Among the many distinguished natives of Lyons may be mentioned Germanicus and the emperors Claudius, Marcus Aurelius, and Caracalla; Ampère the physicist; Richerand, Récamier, and Bonnet; De Jussieu the naturalist, J. B. Say the economist, Barème the mathematician, Suchet the marshal, Roland the Girondin, and Jacquard the inventor. (G. ME.)
