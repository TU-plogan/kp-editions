LOPEZ, Carlos Antonio (1790-1862), a Paraguayan ruler of great ability, born at Asuncion, November 4, 1790, was educated in the ecclesiastical seminary of that city, and by his ability attracted the hostility of the dictator, Francia, in consequence of which he was forced to keep in hiding for several years. He acquired, however, by study, so unusual a knowledge of law and governmental affairs that, on Franciaâ€™s death in 1840, he soon acquired an almost undisputed control of the Paraguayan state, which he maintained uninterruptedly until his own death in 1862. He was successively secretary of the ruling military junta (1840-41), one of the two consuls (1841-44), and president with dictatorial powers (1844-1862) by successive elections for ten and three years, and in 1857 again for ten years, with power to nominate his own successor. Though nominally a president acting under a republican constitution, he ruled despotically, the congress assembling only rarely and on his call, and then only to ratify his decrees. His government was in general directed with wise energy towards developing the material resources and strengthening the military power of the country. His jealousy of foreign approach several times involved him in diplomatic disputes with Brazil, England, and the United States, which nearly resulted in war, but each time he extricated himself by skilful evasions. Paraguay rapidly advanced under his firm and, on the whole, patriotic administration. He died September 10, 1862.
