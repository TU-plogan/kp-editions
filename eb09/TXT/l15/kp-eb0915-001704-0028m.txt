LOUIS III., son of the preceding by Ansgarde, daughter of Count Hardouin of Brittany, was born about the year 863, and in 879 was designated by his father sole heir to the French throne. It was decided among the nobles, however, that the inheritance should be divided between Louis and his younger brother Carloman, the former receiving Neustria, or all France north of the Loire, amj the latter Aquitania and Burgundy. On the Loire and elsewhere the two brothers inflicted several defeats on the Northmen (879-881); but in 882 Louis succumbed to the fatigues of war, leaving his inheritance to Carloman.
