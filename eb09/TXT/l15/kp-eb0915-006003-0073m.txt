LUGANO, Lake of (sometimes called Lago Ceresio by the Italians, from the Roman name Lacus Ceresins'), situated partly in Lombardy and partly in the Swiss canton Tessin or Ticino, takes its ordinary name from the town of Lugano, the only considerable place on its banks. Its form is very irregular, and has been compared to a sickle, a fish-hook, and various other objects. It lies altogether amidst the outer ranges of the Alps that divide the basin of the Ticino from that of the Adda, where the calcareous strata have been disturbed by the intrusion of porphyry and other igneous rocks. It is not connected with any considerable valley, but is fed by numerous torrents in various directions issuing from short glens in the surrounding mountains, and is drained by the Tresa, an unimportant stream that flows westward into the Lago Maggiore. The surface of the lake is 889 feet above the sea, and the form of its bed seems to be very irregular. In some parts soundings of more than 1000 feet have been taken, while in one place the lake is so shallow that a causeway half a mile in length, supporting the road and the railway, has been carried from shore to shore. The scenery is of a varied character: in great part, and especially in the north-east arm extending from Lugano to the Lombard village of Γorlezza, the lake is enclosed between mountains that rise steeply to a height of some 2000 feet from the water’s edge, while on its southern and western branches it is encompassed by gently swelling hills rich with the luxuriance of Italian vegetation.
