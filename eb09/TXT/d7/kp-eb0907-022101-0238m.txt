DIGBY, SirKenelm (1603-1665), an èminent English physical philosopher, born at Gothurst, Buckinghamshire, on the 11th July 1603, was descended from an ancient and illustrious family. His great-grandfather had distinguished himself at Bosworth on the side of Henry VII.; and his father, Sir Everard Digby, was one of the leading Roman Catholic gentry at the time of the Gunpowder Plot. Having risen in arms on that occasion, Sir Everard was executed at London, January 27, 1606. The young philosopher was educated by his guardians in the Protestant faith. Having finished his education at Oxford, he went abroad in 1621, and travelled in France, Spain, and Italy. On his return he was knighted, and received from Charles I. the appointments of gentleman of the bed-chamber, commissioner of the navy, and governor of Trinity House. At the head of a small squadron, which he equipped at his own expense, he sailed in 1628 against the Algerines, and afterwards defeated the Venetians near the port of Scanderoon. During a brief stay in Paris he joined the Church of Rome. Having returned to England in 1638, he espoused the cause of the king, and was imprisoned in Winchester House, by order of the Parliament. He was, however, liberated at the request of the French queendowagerin 1643, and retired to France, where he was taken into the confidence of the court, and enjoyed the friendship of Descartes and other learned men. Here he wrote his Treatise on the Nature of Bodies, his Treatise on the Soul, Peripatetick Institutions, and other works. He visited England, after the defeat of the Royalist party, but the Parliament refused to allow him to remain. Banished from England upon pain of death if he returned, he resumed his residence in France, where he was treated with the highest respect, and was intrusted with an embassy to several of the courts of Italy. He returned again to his native country during the Protectorate of Cromwell, and seemed to be more zealous for the advancement of the interests of the Commonwealth than befitted a staunch royalist. He used his influence to reconcile the Catholics to the Protectorate on condition of their being secured the free exercise of their religion. With Cromwell he was on terms of intimate friendship, the bond of sympathy being probably not so much politics as a common interest in the new-born science of physics. At the Restoration he returned finally to London, where he died in 1665. He married Venetia Anastasia, the daughter of Sir Edward Stanley of Shropshire, “a lady of an extraordinary beauty and of as extraordinary a fame.” His whimsical experiments to preserve her beauty by the invention of new cosmetics procured him as much notoriety as his sympathetic powder for the cure of wounds at a distance. He was appointed one of the council of the Royal Society at the time of its first establishment, and he took a very active part in its management. Besides the works already mentioned, Digby wrote A Conference about a Choice of Religion, Paris, 1638; Letters on the same subject, Lond. 1651; Observations on Religio Medici, Lond. 1645; A Treatise of Adhering to God, Lond. 1654; On the Cure of Wounds by the Powder of Sympathy, Lond. 1658; and a Discourse on Vegetation.
