DOWNPATRICK, a municipal and parliamentary borough and market-town of Ireland, capital of the county of Down, 18 miles S.E. of Belfast, and 74 N.N.E. of Dublin. Downpatrick lies in a valley formed by hills of some elevation, near the south-west extremity of Strangford Lough, and is divided into the English, Irish, and Scotch quarters. It consists of four main streets meeting near the centre, the principal of which are the Irish and English streets. In the former all business is carried on; the latter is well built, and contains neat private residences.

The principal buildings are the cathedral church of the diocese, the parish church, Roman Catholic chapel, two Presbyterian and two Methodist meeting-houses, diocesan school, county court-house, prison, alms-houses, two branch banks, barracks, infirmary, and fever hospital. A small trade is carried on at Strangford Lough by means of vessels of 100 tons, which discharge at Quoil quay, about a mile from the town; but vessels of larger tonnage can discharge at a steamboat quay built lower down the Quoil. The imports are principally iron, coal, salt, and timber; the exportsâ€”barley, oats, cattle, pigs, and potatoes. The linen manufacture is also carried on. The County Down Railway connects the town with the other trading centres, and a line specially constructed in 186'2 connects it with the port of Donaghadee. Brewing, tanning, and soap-making give considerable employment. The Down corporation races are very popular, and are regarded as a meeting for the province. The parliamentary borough, which returns one member to Parliament, had in 1871 a population of 4155, with an area of 1486 acres; the area of the town is 278 acres, population 3621.
