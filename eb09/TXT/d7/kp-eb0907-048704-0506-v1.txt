DRYANDER, Jonas (1748-1810), a Swedish naturalist of eminence, and a pupil of Linnaeus, was bom in 1748. By his uncle, Dr Lars Montin, to whom his education was intrusted, he was sent to the university of Gottenburg, whence he removed to Lund. After taking his degree there in 1776, he studied at Upsala, and then became for a time tutor to a young Swedish nobleman. He next visited England, and, on the death of his friend Dr Solander in 1782, he succeeded him as librarian to Sir Joseph Banks. He was librarian to the Royal Society and also to the Linnean Society. Of the latter, in 1788, he was one of the first founders, and, when it was incorporated by royal charter in 1802, he was chiefly concerned in the drawing up of its laws and regulations. He was vice-president of the society till the time of his death, which took place in October 1810.

Besides papers in the Transactions of the Linnean and other societies, Dryander published Dissertatio gradualis Fungos Regno Vegetabili vindicans, Lond. 1776, and Catalogus Bibliothecae Historico-Naturalis Josephi Banks, Bart., Lond. 1796-1800, 5 vols. He also edited the first and part of the second edition of Alton's Hortus Kewensis, and Roxburgh’s Plants of the Coast of Coromandel.
