DIXON, George (1755-18001), an English navigator, born in 1755. He served under Captain Cook in his third expedition, during which he had an opportunity of learning the commercial capabilities of the north-west coast of America, and was thus prompted to the expedition in connection with which his own name is celebrated. After his return from Cook’s expedition he became a captain in the royal navy. In 1785 he offered his services to the King George’s Sound Company of London in making a minute exploration of the north-west coast of America. His offer having been accepted, he set sail in the autumn of that year in command of the “Queen Charlotte,”—a companion ship, the “King George,” being under the command of Captain Portlock. The voyage resulted in the discovery of numerous small islands, ports, and bays, of which Queen Charlotte’s Island, Port Mulgrave, Norfolk Bay, and Dixon’s Archipelago may be named as the most important.

From North America he sailed to China, where he disposed of his cargo. He returned to England in 1788. In the following year he published an account of his voyage, entitled A Voyage round the World, but more particularly to the North-West Coast of America, the bulk of which consists of descriptive letters by William Beresford, his supercargo. His own contribution to the work included valuable charts and appendices. In 1791 he published The Navigator's Assistant. He died about 1800.
