DIVIDIVI, the commercial name for the astringent pods of Caesalpinia coriaria, a leguminous shrub of the sub-order Caesalpinieae, which grows in low marshy tracts [9:7:293] in the West Indies and the north of South America. The plant is between 20 and 30 feet in height, and bears white flowers. The pods are flattened, and curl up in drying; they are about Â¾ inch broad, from 2 to 3 inches long, ana of a rich brown colour. Dividivi was first brought to Europe from Caracas in 1768. Its value in the manufacture of leather is due to the large amount of tannin contained in the yellow resinous matter exterior to the seed husks. It may be employed in dyeing as a substitute for galls or sumach. Maracaibo, Rio Hacha, and Sabanilla are the ports from which it is principally shipped.
