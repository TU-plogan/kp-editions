DODD, Dr William (1729-1777), an unfortunate English divine, eldest son of the Rev. William Dodd, many years vicar of Bourne, in Lincolnshire was born there in May 1729. He was sent, at the age of sixteen, to the university of Cambridge, where he was admitted a sizar of Clare Hall in 1745. He took the degree of B.A. in 1750, being in the list of wranglers. On leaving the university, he married a young woman of the name of Perkins, the daughter of a verger. She had a more than questionable reputation, and her extravagant habits contributed in no small degree to her husband’s disgrace and ruin. In 1751 he was ordained deacon, and in 1753 priest, and he soon became a popular and celebrated preacher. His first preferment was the lectureship of West-Ham and Bow. In 1754 he was also chosen lecturer of St Olave’s, Hart Street; and in 1757 he took the degree of Μ. A. at Cambridge. He was a strenuous supporter of the Magdalen Hospital, which was founded in 1758, and soon afterwards became preacher at the chapel of that charity. In 1763 he obtained a prebend at Brecon, and in the same year he was appointed one of the king’s chaplains,—soon after which the education of Philip Stanhope, afterwards earl of Chesterfield, was committed to his care. In 1766 he went to Cambridge, and took the degree of LL.D. At this period he was held in high estimation; but eager for further advancement, he unhappily entered on courses which in the end proved the occasion of his ruin. On the living of St George’s, Hanover Square, becoming vacant, he wrote an anonymous letter to the wife of the lord chancellor offering three thousand guineas if, by her assistance, he was promoted to the benefice. This letter having been traced to him, a complaint was immediately made to the king, and he was dismissed with disgrace from his office of chaplain. After residing for some time at Geneva and Paris, he returned to England in 1776. He still continued to exercise his clerical functions, but his extravagant mode of life soon involved him in difficulties. To meet the demands of his creditors he forged a bond on his former pupil Lord Chesterfield for £4200, and actually received the money. But he was detected, committed to prison, tried at the Old Bailey, found guilty, and sentenced to death; and, in spite of numerous applications for mercy, he was executed at Tyburn on the 27th June 1777. Dr Samuel Johnson was very zealous in pleading for a pardon, and a petition from the city of London received 23,000 signatures. Dr Dodd was a voluminous writer, and possessed considerable abilities, with but little judgment and much vanity. His Beauties of Shakespeare, published before he entered the church, was long a well-known work; and his Thoughts in Prison, a poem in blank verse, written in the interval between his conviction and his execution, naturally attracted much attention. He published a large number of sermons and other theological works. An accurate list of his various writings is prefixed to his Thoughts in Prison.
