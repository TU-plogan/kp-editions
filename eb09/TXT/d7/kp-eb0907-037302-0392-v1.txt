DORT, or Dordrecht, an important commercial city of Holland, at the head of a district in the province of South Holland, 10 miles S.E. of Rotterdam, on the' railway between that city and Breda. The island of the Meuse or Merwe on which it stands is said to have been separated [9:7:374] from the mainland in 1421, by an inundation which swept away 72 villages, and about 100,000 inhabitants. Concerning its origin there is no authentic information, but it is certainly one of the oldest cities of Holland, and probably dates from the 10 th century. It was surrounded by walls in 1231 by Florent IV., count of Holland, who made it his residence, and granted it many important privileges. In 1457, almost the entire town, including the church of Notre Dame, founded in 1366, and other public buildings, was destroyed by fire. One of the first towns in the Netherlands to embrace the Reformed religion, and to throw off the yoke of the Spanish king, it was chosen in 1572 as the meeting-place of the deputies by whom the independence of the United Provinces was first asserted; and in 1618 and 1619 it became intimately associated with the theological history of Europe, as the seat of the great synod which declared against the Arminian party. Among its celebrities are the De Witts and Ary Scheffer the artist. The town-hall is a handsome building, and the principal church is an old Gothic structure 300 feet long by 125 wide, with a heavy square tower, and numerous monumental stones, some of great antiquity. The hall in which the synod was held is now demolished. The houses are generally of an antique fashion, with the gables turned outwards, and many of them date from the period of the Spanish occupation. Dort possesses a good harbour, from which two canals lead to the centre of the town. It carries on an extensive trade in corn, flax, salt fish, train oil, and the timber which is brought down the Rhine; and it has shipbuilding docks, saw-mills, sugar-refineries, tobaccofactories, linen-bleacheries, salt-works, and white-lead works. Population in 1850, 20,878, and in 1874, 25,577.
