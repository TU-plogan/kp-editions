DEREYEH, or Deraya, a town of Arabia, in the Nejd, on the caravan-route from the Red Sea to the Persian Gulf, about 15 miles west of Riad. It was formerly the capital of the Wahabees, and had a population of about 30,000 inhabitants; but it has never recovered from the ruin inflicted on it by the army of Ibrahim Pasha in 1818.
