DUNKIRK, a lake-port town of the United States, in Chautauqua county, New York, situated on a small bay in Lake Erie, 40 miles south-west of Buffalo. It is an important station on the Lake railroad, and forms the western terminus of the Erie line; and by means of the Carrolton railroad it has connection with the Pennsylvania coal-fields. The town occupies an elevated and agreeable position on the lake, and its harbour is free of ice earlier in the spring than the neighbouring port of Buffalo. The industries of the place comprise oil-refining, and the manufacture of glue, flour, and iron-work. Population (1870), 5231.
