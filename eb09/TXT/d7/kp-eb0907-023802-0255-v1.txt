DIJON {Divio, Dibio, or Divionense Castrum), the chief town of the department of Côte-d’Or in France,' and formerly capital of the province of Burgundy, is situated at the foot of Mount Affrique, in a fertile plain, on the Burgundy canal, and at the confluence of the Ouche and Suzon, in 47° 19' 19” N. lat., and 5° 2' 5” E. long. The streets are broad and well built of freestone, and there are fifteen squares; an abundant supply of water is obtained from the vale of Suzon by means of a subterranean aqueduct nearly eight miles in length. Among the more noteworthy of the public edifices are the cathedral of St Bénigne, in the Gothic style of the 13th century, with a spire erected in 1742; the church of Notre Dame built in 1331-1445, containing a group in stone, the Assumption of the Virgin, by Dubois, and a statue of the Black Virgin, celebrated in the Middle Ages; the church of St Michel, of the 16th century; the general hospital, founded by Otho III. in 1206; the castle, commenced in 1478 by Louis XL, and finished in 1512 by Louis XII., once a state prison, in which the duchess of Maine, Mirabeau, the Chevalier d’Eon, and Toussaint Louverture were confined, and since then a barrack for gendarmes; and the old palace of the dukes of Burgundy, or hôtel de ville, rebuilt between the end of the 17th and the end of the 18th century, in which are an art collection, the archives, a museum of natural history, a school of arts, and the sálle des gardes, containing the [9:7:239] tombs of Philippe le Hardi and Jean sans Peur. Important structures also are the lunatic asylum, the ancient courthouse, the theatre, and the hospice Saint-Anne, and numerous other educational establishments. Dijon possesses a library of 70,000 volumes and 900 manuscripts, a picture gallery, a collection of coins and of 40,000 engravings, a jardin des plantes and herbarium, and a fine park, commenced in 1670, after the designs of Le Nôtre, by the Great Condé, and finished by his son. It is the seat of a bishop, and of tribunals of primary instance and commerce, and has faculties of law, science, and literature. The ramparts that formerly surrounded the town have been replaced by broad avenues. The principal industries are the manufacture of hosiery, woollen and cotton cloth, Paris lace, leather, candles, earthenware, mustard, confections, vinegar, and chemicals; iron and type-founding, printing and binding, brewing, saltpetre-refining, and nursery-gardening. Dijon does an important trade in cereals, and is the chief emporium for Burgundy wines. The population of the commune in 1872 was 42,573; that of the town, 40,116.

Dijon was a fortified ’ camp of the Romans, and about 274 was enlarged by Aurelian. In 731 it was taken and burnt by the Saracens. Councils were held there in 1077, 1116, and 1199 or 1200. Early in the 12th century the town was almost entirely destroyed by fire, hut it was soon rebuilt. Till 1107 it was held by the counts of Dijon, and from 1179 to the death of Charles the Bold in 1477 it was the residence of the dukes of Burgundy; it then came into the possession of Louis XL, who established there the Burgundian “Parlement.” In 1513 Dijon was besieged by 20,000 Swiss, with whom a humiliating treaty was concluded. On October 31, 1870, the town capitulated to General Werder; it was evacuated by the Germans on the 27th of December, and early in January 1871 became the head-quarters of the French eastern army under Bourbaki. On the 1st of the following February it was reoccupied by the Germans. Dijon is the birthplace of Bossuet, Jacques Cazotte, the elder Crébillon,. Ðaubenton, Jouffroy, Long-pierre, Bernard delà Monnoie, Guyton de Morvean, Piron, Rameau, and Saumaise.
