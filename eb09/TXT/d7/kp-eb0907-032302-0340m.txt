DODWELL, Edward (1767-1832), an English antiquarian writer and draughtsman of considerable note in the department of classical investigation. He belonged to the same family as Henry Dodwell the theologian, and received his education at Cambridge. Being under no necessity to adopt a profession as a means of livelihood, he devoted himself entirely to his favourite pursuits, travelled for several years—from 1801 to 1806—in Greece, and spent the rest of his life for the most part in Italy, either at Naples or at Rome. An illness contracted in 1830 during a visit of exploration to the Sabine Mountains, undermined his constitution and ultimately resulted in his death, which took place at Rome in May 1832. His widow, a daughter of Count Giraud, was thirty years his junior, and after his death became famous as the “beautiful” countess of Spaur, and played a considerable rôle in the political life of the Papal city.

His works are— A Classical and Topographical Tour through Greece, 2 vols., London, 1819, of which a German translation by Sickler was published at Meiningen in 1821; Views in Greece, consisting of thirty toloured plates, London, 1821; and Views and Descriptions of Cyclopian and Pelasgic Remains in Italy and Greece, London 1834. The last work, which contains 130 plates, was brought out simultaneously at Paris with a French text.
