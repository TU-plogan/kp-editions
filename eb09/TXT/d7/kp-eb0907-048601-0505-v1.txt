DRUSIUS, or Van den Dkiesche, Johannes (1550- 1616), a learned Protestant divine, distinguished specially as an Orientalist and exegete, was bom at Oudenarde, in Flanders, on the 28th June 1550. Being designed for tho [9:7:487] church, he studied Greek and Latin at Ghent, and philosophy at Louvain; but his father having been outlawed for his religion, and deprived of his estate, retired to England, where the son followed him in 1567. He found an admirable teacher of Hebrew in Chevalier, the celebrated Orientalist, with whom he resided for some time at Cambridge. In 1572 he became professor of Oriental languages at Oxford. Upon the pacification of Ghent (1576) he returned with his father to their own country, and was appointed professor of Oriental languages at Leyden in the following year. In 1585 he removed to Friesland, and was admitted professor of Hebrew in the university of Franeker, an office which he discharged with great honour till his death, which happened in February 1616 He acquired so extended a reputation as a professor that his class was frequented by students from all the Protestant countries of Europe. His works prove him to have been well skilled in Hebrew and in Jewish antiquities; and in 1600 the States-general employed him, at a salary of 400 florins a year, to write notes on the most difficult passages in the Old Testament; but, as he was frequently interrupted in prosecuting this undertaking, it was not published until after his death. As the friend of Arminius, he was charged by the orthodox and dominant party with unfairness in the execution of this task, and the last sixteen years of his life were, therefore, somewhat embittered by controversy. He carried on an extensive correspondence with the learned in different countries; for, beside letters in Hebrew, Greek, and other languages, there were found amongst his papers upwards of 2000 written in Latin. He had a son, John, who died in England at the age of twenty-one, and was accounted a prodigy of learning. He had mastered Hebrew at the age of nine, and Scaliger said that he was a better Hebrew scholar than his father. He wrote a large number of letters in Hebrew, besides notes on the Proverbs of Solomon and other works.

Paquot states the number of the printed works and treatises of the elder Drusius at forty-eight, and of the unprinted at upwards of twenty. Of the former more than two-thirds were inserted in the collection entitled Critici Sacri, sive Annotata doctissimorum Virorum in Vetus et Novum Testamentum (Amsterdam, 1698, in 9 vols. folio, or London, 1660, in 10 vols, folio.) Amongst the works of Drusius not to be found in this collection may be mentioned—1. Alphabetum Hebraicum vetus, (1584, 4to); 2. Tabula in Grammaticam Chaldaicam ad usum Juventutis, (1602, 8vo); 3. An edition of Sulpicius Severus (Franeker, 1807, 12mo); 4. Opuscula quae ad Grammaticam spectant omnia, (1609, 4to); 5. Lacrymae in obitum J. Scaligeri, (1609, 4to); and 6. Grammatica Linguae Sanctoe nova (1612. 4to.)
