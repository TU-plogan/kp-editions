DENIZEN, an alien who obtains by letters patent (ex donatione regis) certain of the privileges of a British subject. He cannot be a member of the Privy Council or of Parliament, or hold any civil or military office of trust, or take a grant of land from the Crown. The Naturalization Act, 1870, provides that nothing therein contained shall affect the grant of any letters of denization by Her Majesty. See Naturalization.
