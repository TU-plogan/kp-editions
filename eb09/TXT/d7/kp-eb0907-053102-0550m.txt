DUNBAR, a royal and parliamentary burgh and 3eaport of Scotland, in the county of Haddington, situated on an eminence near the mouth of the Firth of Forth, 29} miles E.N.E. of Edinburgh by the North British railway. The ruins of the castle, the remains of the Grey Friars’ monastery founded in 1218, and a mansion house of the Lauderdale family, are the principal objects of historical interest. The parish church is a fine building of red sandstone, with a tower about 107 feet in height, which forms a well-known landmark to seamen; it dates only from 1819, but occupies the site of what was probably the first collegiate church established in Scotland, and still preserves the large marble monument of Sir George Home, created earl of Dunbar and March by James VI. in 1605. The town-hall, the assembly rooms, the public schools, the [9:7:532] mechanics’ institute and subscription library, and the benevolent institutions require no special notice. The principal source of wealth is the herring fishery, which fosters' an extensive curing trade; but ship-building is also carried on, and there are several iron foundries, breweries, and distilleries, as weil as a large paper-mill in the vicinity. The harbour, formerly small and shallow, has been greatly enlarged and improved in the course of the present century, at the joint expense of the town and the Fishery Board; but the entrance is rendered somewhat dangerous by the number of craggy islets and sunken rocks. Dunbar unites with Haddington, Jedburgh, Lauder, and North Berwick in returning a member to Parliament. In 1875-6 the value of real property was £1 1,832. Population in 1871, 3320.

The castle of Dunbar, mentioned as early as 856, from the strength of its position became of great importance as a bulwark against English invasion, and a town grew up under its protection, which was created a royal burgh by Dâvid II. It was captured by Edward I., who defeated the forces of Baliol in the neighbourhood of the town in 1296; it afforded shelter to Edward II. on his flight from Bannockburn; and it was besieged in 1337 by the English under Montague earl of Salisbury, but was successfully defended by Black Agnes of Dunbar, countess of March and a member of the Douglas family. In the 15th century it was chosen as her usual residence by Joanna Beaufort, the widow of James I. of Scotland; and in the 16th it served on several occasions as a retreat for the unfortunate Queen Mary. An Act of Parliament had been passed in 1488 ordering the demolition of the castle, but it was reserved for the Regent Murray to effect its destruction in 1567. A battle popularly known as the “race of Dunbar” was fought in 1658 between Cromwell and Leslie, and resulted in the total rout of the Scotch.
