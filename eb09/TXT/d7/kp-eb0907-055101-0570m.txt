DUPUYTREN, Guillaume, Baron (1777-1835), one of the most distinguished of French anatomists and surgeons, was born October 6, 1777, at Pierre Buffière, a small town of Limousin. He was sprung from poor parents, and was furnished with the means of receiving an ordinary education at the Collége de la Marche by SGme charitable persons to whom he had been introduced. At the newly established Ecole de Médecine, under Fourcroy, he began the study of medicine with great diligence, and was appointed by competition prosector of the faculty when only eighteen years of age. His early studies were directed chiefly to morbid anatomy, which he did much to establish on a scientific basis, though many of his theories were unsound. In 1803 he was appointed assistant-surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu; and he was appointed professor of operative surgery in succession to Sabbatier in 1811. In 1815 he was appointed to the chair of clinical surgery, and three years later he became head surgeon at the Hôtel-Dieu. Many other offices were conferred upon him; he became inspector of the university, a chevalier and afterwards an officer in the Legion of Honour, chevalier of St Michel, baron, member of the Institute, and first surgeon to the king. Dupuytren’s energy and industry were alike remarkable. He visited the Hôtel-Dieu morning and evening, performing at each time several operations, lectured to vast throngs of students, gave advice to his out-door patients, and fulfilled the duties consequent upon one of the largest practices of modem times. By his indefatigable activity he amassed a fortune of £300,000, the bulk of which he bequeathed to his daughter, with the deduction of considerable sums for the endowment of the anatomical chair in the Ecole de Médecine, and the establishment of a benevolent institution for distressed medical men. The most important of Dupuytren’s writings is his Treatise on Artificial Anus, in which the principles laid down by John Hunter are happily applied. In his operations he was remarkable for the skill and dexterity with which he overcame the numerous difficulties incidental to so extensive a practice as he enjoyed. He had complete control over his feelings, and great readiness of resource. Instead of attempting to introduce new methods of procedure, he commonly limited himself to modifying and adapting to his particular exigencies the established laws of surgery. He was thus led to invent several new surgical instraments. In private life Dupuytren was cold and reserved; and this was perhaps increased by his constant struggle against a consumptive tendency, which ultimately carried him off, 8th February 1835. In November 1833 he had suffered a slight shock of apoplexy, but he continued in practice almost until the day of his death.
