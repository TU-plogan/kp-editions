DION CHRYSOSTOM (z>., golden mouthed), (c. 50- 117), was born at Prusa, in Bithynia, about the middle of the lst century. He visited Egypt with his father at an early period of his life, and went to Rome during the reign of Domitian. Being implicated in a plot against the tyrant, Dion fled from the capital, and wandered about in Thrace, Mysia, Scythia, and the other countries of the Getae, with only Platoâ€™s Phaedo and Demosthenes On the Embassy in his possession, till the accession of Nerva, when he was allowed to return. With Nerva and Trajan he continued on the most friendly footing. He retired to Prusa for a short time; but having been accused of peculation and treason, he returned to Rome, where he remained till his death. Eighty orations of his are extant entire, and there are fragments of about fifteen others. They are written in a lucid and elegant style, and treat mostly of political, ethical, and mythological subjects.
