DNIESTER, the Tyras of the classical authors, and the Turla of the Turks, a river of south-eastern Europe belonging to the basin of the Black Sea. It takes its rise on the northern slope of the Carpathian Mountains in the Sambor circle of Galicia, and belongs for the first 330 miles of its course to Austrian, for the remaining 600 to Russian territory. In its excessive meandering it frequently almost returns to the same spot; for example, while the actual distance from Turunchuk to Mayakoff is about 33 miles, the development of the river would require about 133. At the same time, as the average fall is from 25 to 26 inches in the mile, the current in most parts even during low water is pretty rapid, the mean rate per hour being calculated at 8638 feet. The average width of the channel is from 560 to 700 feet, but in some places it attains as much as 1400 feet; the depth is various and changeable. The banks are usually about 3500 feet apart, but in certain reaches approach each other so as to leave room for nothing but the actual bed; their average height above the water in the Bessarabian portion is 350 feet. The principal interruption in the navigable portion of the river, besides the somewhat extensive shallows, is occasioned by a granitic spur from the Carpathians, and bears the name of the Yampo]skie Porogi, or Yampol Rapids. For ordinary river-craft the passage of these rapids is rendered possible, but not free from danger, by a natural channel on the left side, and a larger and deeper artificial channel on the right; for steam-boats they form an insuperable barrier. The river falls into the sea by several shallow arms, of which the most important has a depth of only 2∣ feet near its mouth; but the Turunchuk, an independent stream, disemboguing in the neighbourhood, has a depth of 7 or 8 feet, and is connected with the main channel of the Dniester by the Surovtzoff canal, so named after the merchant at whose expense it was constructed. There are two periodical floods in the river,—the first and greatest caused by the breaking up of the ice, and occurring in the latter part of February or in March; and the second, due to the melting of the snows of the Carpathians, and consequently taking place about June. The spring flood raises the level of the water 20 feet, and pours along so violent a current that large blocks of stone are drifted from their position; towards the mouth of the river gardens and vineyards are submerged, and the surface of the stream measures from four to six miles across. In some years the general state of the water is so low that navigation is possible only for threeor four weeks, while in other years it is so high that navigation continues without interruption. Steamboat traffic was introduced in the lower reaches in 1840, when [9:7:307] the government vessel “Prince Vorontzoff” began to make regular trips between Ovidiopol and Akerman; and since that date it has acquired very considerable dimensions. The fisheries of the estuary are of some importance; and the lakes which are formed by the inundations of the valley furnish a valuable addition to the diet of the people in the shape of carp, pike, and tench. The principal towns on the river are Sambor, Khotin, Mohileff, Dubossari, Grigoriopol, Bender, Tiraspol, and Akerman; its tributaries are numerous, but not of individual importance.
