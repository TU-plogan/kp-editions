DIAZ DE LA PENA, Narcisse Virgile (1809-1876), a French artist, distinguished chiefly as a landscape painter, was born at Bordeaux in August 1809. His first works were exhibited at the Salon in 1831, and attracted little notice, being poor in colour, the quality for which he afterwards became conspicuous. The same criticism applies to the pictures he exhibited annually until 1840, when his style underwent a decided change. His Nymphes de Calypso (1840), Le Rêve (1841), Vue de Bas-Bréau, L’Orientale, Le Maléfice, and Les Bohémiens se rendant à une Fête (1844), showed in an increasing degree the richness of colour and the mastery of the more subtle effects of light and shade which ultimately obtained for Diaz a place in the first rank of landscape painters. His powers were seen at their best in his Baigneuse and L’Amour désarmé (1851), and in the pictures he sent to the Paris Exhibition of 1855, Les Présents d’Amour, La Rivale, La Fin d’un Beau Jour, Nymphe Endormie, Les Dernières Larmes, &c. As the titles of several of these works indicate, Diaz endeavoured to add to the interest of his landscapes by introducing into them the personages of the classical mythology. Late in his career he devoted himself to genre subjects with but indifferent success. Diaz received a medal of the third class in 1844, of the second class in 1846, and of the first class in 1848; and in 1851 he was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He died in November 1876.
