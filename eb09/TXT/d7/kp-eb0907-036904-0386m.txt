DORP, a town of Prussia, in the government of DÃ¼sseldorf, 17 miles north-east of Cologne, which, like Barmen and many other towns in the valley of the Wupper, has since 1849 rapidly grown into importance as a centre of manufacturing industry. Tobacco, paper, steel, and iron wares are the principal objects of its activity. In 1872 the population amounted to 10,689.
