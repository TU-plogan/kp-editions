DODERLEIN, Johann Christoph Wilhelm Ludwig (1791-1863), a distinguished German philologist, was born at Jena on the 19th December 1791. His father, Johann Christoph Döderlein, professor of theology at Jena, was celebrated for his varied learning, for his eloquence as a preacher, and for the important influence he exerted in guiding the transition movement from strict orthodoxy to a freer theology. Ludwig Döderlein, after receiving his preliminary education at Windsheim and Schulpforta, studied at Munich, Heidelberg, Erlangen, and Berlin. He devoted his chief attention to philology under the instruction of such men as Thiersch, Creuzer, Voss, Wolf, Boeckh, and Buttmann. In 1815, soon after completing his studies at Berlin, he accepted the appointment of ordinary professor of philology in the academy of Bern. In 1819 he was transferred to Erlangen, where he became second professor of philology in the university and rector of the gymnasium. In 1827 he became first professor of philology and rhetoric and director of the philological seminary. He continued to discharge the duties of both these offices until within a short period of his death, which occurred on the 9th November 1863. Döderlein’s most valuable work as a philologist was rendered in the department of etymology and lexicography. He is best known by his Lateinische Synonymen und Etymologien (6 vols., Leipsic, 1826-38), and his Eιomerische Glossarium (3 vols., Erlangen, 1850-58). To the same class belong his Lateinische Wortbildung (Leipsic, 1838), Handbuch der Lateinischen Synonymik, (Leipsic, 1839), and the Handbuch der Lateinischen Etymologie (Leipsic, 1841), besides various works of a more elementary kind intended for the use of schools and gymnasia. Most of the works named have been translated into English. To critical philology Doderlein contributed valuable editions of Tacitus {Opera, 1847; Germania, with a German translation) and Horace {Epistolae, with a German translation, 1856—8; Satirae, 1860). His Reden und Aufsätzen (Erlangen, 1843-7) and Oeffentliche Reden (1860) consist chiefly of academic addresses dealing with various subjects in paedagogy and philology.
