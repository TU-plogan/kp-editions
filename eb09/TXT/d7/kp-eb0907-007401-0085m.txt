DEMOTICA, a town of European Turkey in the province of Adrianople and sanjak of Gallipoli, situated 25 miles south of the provincial capital, at the foot of a conical hill which rises on the right bank of the Maritza near its junction with the Kizildeki. It is the seat of a Greek archbishop; and, besides the ancient citadel and palace on the top of the hill, it possesses several Greek churches, a mosque, and public baths. Charles XII. of Sweden resided at Demotica for more than a year after the battle of Pultowa. The town was in great part burned down in 1845.
