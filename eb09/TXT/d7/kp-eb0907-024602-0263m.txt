DIOMEDES, son of the impetuous Tydeus, is a hero of the Aetolian and Argo -Theban legends. He is in the Ilicul the leader of the tribes which belong to the government of the Amythonidae. A favourite of Athene, from whom he received the gift of immortality, he does not spare even gods if she is standing by his side. He carried off the Trojan Palladium and brought it to Argos, where it was preserved by his descendants. He was known in many other places as a devotee of Athene and a supporter of her worship. In Argos his shield was carried through the town as a relic on the festival of Athene. A temple of Athene Anemotis (the storm ruler) was said to have been founded by him. He was worshipped in several parts of Italy, and in Salamis in Cyprus. Indeed he may be said generally to belong to the worship of Athene in so far as she is the goddess of storm and war.
