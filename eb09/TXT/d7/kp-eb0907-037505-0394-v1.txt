DOUBS, an eastern frontier department of France, so named from its chief river, is formed of the ancient German principality of Montbéliard (Mömpelgard), and of part of the province of Franche-Comté. It is bounded E.S.E. by Switzerland, N. by the territory of Belfort and by Haute-Saône, and N.W. and S.W. by Haute-Saône and Jura; and lies between 46° 33' 10" and 47° 33' 45" N. lat,, and 5° 42' and 7° E. long. The surface is chiefly mountainous, four parallel chains of the Jura crossing it from S.W. to N.E. In the loftiest and most easterly chain the principal summit, Mont d’Or, has an altitude of 4800 feet; in the most westerly the highest points do not exceed 1000 feet. The riv∙er Doubs rises at the foot of the Noir Mont, in the arrondissement of Pontarlier, and, after twice traversing the department, passes through Jura, enters Saône-et-Loir, and joins the Saône at Verdun, after a course of 267 miles. It is navigable from Voujaucourt, near Montbéliard, to its mouth. Near Morteau it forms a cataract 88 feet in height. From Voujaucourt to Dole it constitutes a part of the navigable canal between the Rhone and Rhine. Doubs is well watered by smaller rivers and rivulets. The climate, owing to the differences of elevation, is variable; but it is generally cold and rainy, and the winters are severe. The soil is stony and loamy, and at the higher levels there are numerous peat-bogs. The department may be divided into three regions. The highest, on which the snow usually lies [9:7:376] from six to eight months in the year, is in part barren, but on its less exposed slopes is occupied by forests of fir trees, and affords good pasturage for cattle. In the second or lower region the oak, beech, walnut, and sycamore flourish; and the valleys are susceptible of cultivation. The region of the plains is the most fertile, and produces wheat, rye, maize, hemp, pulse, and grapes and other fruits. Agriculture is in a backward state, but cattle-rearing and dairy-farming receive much attention. Gruyère cheese to the value of seven millions of francs is produced yearly. The most important manufactures are watches, of which about 300,000 are annually made, cotton and woollen cloths, hardware, cutlery, paper, glass, and leather. There are several iron foundries, and distilleries for brandy and absinthe; and the trade in cattle, hides, and timber is considerable. Among the mineral products are iron, coal, lignite, marble, building stone, gypsum, glass-sand, and grindstones. Doubs is divided into the arrondissements of Besançon, Pontarlier, Baume-les-Dames, and Montbéliard, comprising 27 cantons and 639 communes. The capital is Besançon. Of the total area of 522,755 hectares (1,291,200 acres), about 462,353 acres are arable, 299,329 under wood, 19,848 vineyard, 215,684 meadows, and 225,294 heath. The population in 1872 was 291,251.
