DUMONT D’URVILLE, Jules Sébastien César (1790-1842), a French navigator, born in the town of Condé-sur-Noireau, in Normandy. The death of his father, who before the revolution had held a judicial post in Condé, devolved the care of his education on his mother and his maternal uncle, the Abbé De Croisilles. Failing to pass the entrance examination for the Ecole Polytechnique, he went to sea in 1807 as a novice on board the “Aquilon,” and soon attracted the attention of the captain, Maignon, by his studious disposition. During the next twelve years he gradually rose in his profession, and continued through all its multitudinous vicissitudes to increase his scientific and linguistic acquisitions: botany, entomology, English, German, Spanish, Italian, and even Hebrew and Greek were added to the more professional branches. In 1820, while engaged in a survey of the Mediterranean under Captain Gauthier of the “Chevrette,” he was fortunate enough to recognize the Venus of Milo in a Greek statue recently unearthed, and to secure its preservation by the report he presented to the French ambassador at Constantinople. A wider field for his energies was furnished in 1822 by the exploring expedition of the “Coquille” under the command of his friend Duperrey; and on its return in 1825 his services were rewarded by promotion to the rank of capitaine de frégate, and he was intrusted with the control of a similar enterprise. The “Astrolabe,” as he new-named the “Coquille,” left Toulon on April 25, 1826, and reached Marseilles again on 25th of March 1829,—having traversed the South Atlantic, coasted the Australian continent from .King George’s Sound to Port Jackson, laid down various parts of New Zealand, and visited the Fiji Islands, the Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia, New Guinea, Amboyna, Van Diemen’s Land, the Caroline Islands, Celebes, and Mauritius. Promotion to the rank of capitaine de vaisseau was bestowed on the commander in August 1829; and in August of the following year he was charged with the deb cate task of conveying the exiled King Charles X. to England. His proposal to undertake a voyage of discovery to the south polar regions was discouraged by Arago and others, who criticised the work of the previous expedition in no measured terms; but at last, in 1837, all difficulties were surmounted, and on 7th September he set sail from Toulon with the “Astrolabe” and its convoy “La Zélée.” On 15th January 1838 they sighted the Antarctic ice, and soon after their progress southwards was blocked by a continuous bank, which they vainly coasted for 300 miles to the east. Returning westward they visited the South Orkney Islands and part of the New Shetlands, and discovered Joinville Island and Louis Philippe’s Land, but were compelled by scurvy to seek succour at Talcahuano in Chili. Thence they proceeded across the Pacific and through the Asiatic archipelago, visiting among others the Fiji and the Pelew Islands, coasting New Guinea, and circumnavigating Borneo. In 1840, leaving their sick at Hobart Town, Tasmania, they returned to the Antarctic region, and on the 21st of the month were rewarded by the discovery of Adélie Land, in 140° E. of Greenwich. The 6th of November found them at Toulon. D’Urville was at once appointed rear-admiral, and in 1841 he received the gold medal of the Société de Géographie. On the 8th of May 1842 he was killed along with his wife and son in a railway accident near Meudon. Though many of his observations are no longer regarded as trustworthy on account of the defective character of the instruments employed, he made many important additions to various departments of scientific geography; and his natural history collections were especially valuable. His principal works are— Enum. plantarum quas in insulis Archipel, aut littoribus Ponti Euxini, &c., 1822; the Histoire du voyage (5 vols, of the 22) in the great work on the “Astrolabe” expedition in 1826-1829; the first part of the Histoire du voyage (10 vols, of the 23) in the series devoted to the expedition from 1837 to 1840; Voyages autour du Monde: résumé général des voyages de Magellan, &c., 1833, 1844.
