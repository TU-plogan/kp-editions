DYER, John, English poet, was born in 1699 or 1700 at Aberglasney, in Carmarthenshire, where his father, Robert Dyer, successfully practised as a solicitor. He was sent to Westminster school to be educated under Dr Friend, and was destined to succeed to his father’s business. He showed, however, an inveterate dislike to the study of the law, and, having a taste for design, he induced his parents to allow him to adopt the profession of an artist. He wandered about South Wales, sketching landscapes and occasionally painting portraits. In 1726 his first poem, Grongar Hill, appeared in a miscellany published by Richard Savage, the poet. It was an irregular ode in the so-called Pindaric style, but Dyer entirely rewrote it into a loose measure of four cadences, and printed it separately in 1727. It had an immediate and brilliant success. Grongar Hill, as it now stands, is a short poem of only 150 lines, [9:7:581] describing in language of much freshness and picturesque charm the view from a hill overlooking the poet’s native vale of Towy. Artless in an affected age, the natural images which crowd upon one another in this charming little poem are as admirable now as when they were written, and hold an assured place in English literature. Dyer’s ambition to succeed as a painter impelled him to visit Italy, and about ten years after the publication of Grongar Hili he seems to have attained this great desire, and to have spent some time in the south of Europe. It was in consequence of this tour that he wrote his next poem, The Ruins of Rome, a descriptive piece in about 600 lines of Miltonic blank verse. In this work the phraseology is pompous and conventional, but there is considerable knowledge displayed, and the ardour of a true lover of antiquity. The Ruins of Rome appeared in 1740, and increased its author’s reputation. Having fallen into bad health while painting in the Campagna, and finding that he was not destined to excel in the practice of art, he determined to enter into holy orders. In 1741 he was ordained by the bishop of Lincoln, and presented with the living of Calthorpe, in Leicestershire. He was married about this time to a lady descended from the brother of Shakespeare. In 1751 he was translated to the living of Belchford, in Lincolnshire, to which was added in 1752 that of Coningsby. In 1756 he exchanged Belchford for the wealthier incumbency of Kirby-on-Bane. In 1757 he published his longest work, the didactic epic of The Fleece, in four books, of which the first discoursed of the tending of sheep, the second of the shearing and preparation of the wool, the third of weaving, and the fourth of trade in woollen manufactures. The subject was prosy, and the stately blank verse in which it was discussed gave the poem a ridiculous air. The town took no interest in it, and the wits facetiously prophesied that “Mr Dyer would be buried in flannel.” He did. in fact, very shortly afterwards follow his poem to the grave, for he died of consumption on the 24th of July 1758, leaving a wife and four children. After his death his genius was defended and his writings analyzed by Scott of Amwell, who published a commentary on Dyer’s poems. The latter were collected by Dodsley in 1770, but they only form one small volume. Grongar Hill has been compared with Sir John Denham’s Cooper’s Hill, which may in some measure have suggested it. These two pieces remain the most important topographical poems in English literature, if we exclude Ben Jonson’s Penshurst.
