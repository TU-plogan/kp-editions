DOBRIZHOFFER, Martin (1717-1791), a Roman Catholic missionary, whose fame is preserved by the historical interest and the literary character of his narrative. Born at Gratz, in Styria, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1736, and in 1749 proceeded to Paraguay, where for eighteen years, first among the Guaranis, and latterly among the Abipones, he continued with steadfast devotion and easy cheerfulness to discharge the difficult and hazardous duties of his profession. Returning to Europe on the expulsion of the Jesuits from South America, he settled at Vienna, obtained the patronage, or rather the friendship, of Maria Theresa, survived the extinction of his order, composed the history of his mission, and died on July 17, 1791. His history appeared at Vienna in 1784, in the author’s own Latin, and in a German translation by Professor Krai] of the university of Pesth. Of the contents of the work some idea may be obtained from its extended title :— Historia de Abiponibus, Equestri Bellicosaque Paraquariae Natione, locupletata Copiosis Barbararum Gentium Urbium, Fluminum, Ferarum, Amphibiorum, Insectorum, Serpentium proecipuorum, Piscium, Avium, Arborum, Plantarum aliar unique ejusdem Provincioe Proprietatum Observationibus. The “lively singularity” and garrulous quaintness of the style could only be displayed by lengthened quotation. In 1822 there appeared in London an anonymous (not altogether complete) translation, which has not unfrequently been ascribed to Southey, but was really the work of Sara Coleridge, who, while still in her teens, had undertaken the task to defray the college expenses of one of her brothers. To the youthful translator a delicate compliment was paid by Southey in the third canto of his Tale of Paraguay, the story of which was derived from the pages of Dobrizhoffer’s narrative :—

“And if he could in Merlin’s glass have seen

By whom his tomes to speak our tongue were taught, The old man would have felt as pleased, I ween, As when he won the ear of that great Empress Queen.”
