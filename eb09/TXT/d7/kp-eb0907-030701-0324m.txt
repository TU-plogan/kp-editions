DOAB, or Duab, or Dooab, a name, like the Greek Mesopotamia, applicable, according to its derivation {do, two, and ab, river), to the stretch of country lying between any two rivers, as the Baree Doab between the Sutlej and the Ravee, or the Reechna Doab between the Ravee and the Chenab, but frequently employed, without any distinctive adjunct, as the proper name for the region between the Ganges and its great tributary the Jumna. In like manner the designation of Doab Canal is given to the artificial channel which breaks off from the Jumna near Fyzabad, and flows almost parallel with the river till it reunites with it at Delhi.
