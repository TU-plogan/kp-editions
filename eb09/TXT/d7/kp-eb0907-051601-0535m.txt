DUGDALE, Sir William (1605-1686), an eminent English antiquary, the only son of John Dugdale, who belonged to an old Lancashire family, but had sold his property in that county and bought the estate of Shustoke, near Coleshill, in Warwickshire, was born on the 12 th September 1605. He received the early part of his education from Thomas Sibley, a curate near Shustoke, and attended from his tenth to his fifteenth year the Free School at Coventry, whence returning to his father, he read with him for some time law and history. In compliance with his father’s wish, who was old and infirm, and desired to see him married before he died, he was married at the early age of seventeen to the daughter of a gentleman in the county of Stafford. He lived in his wife’s father’s house until the death of his own father in 1624, and soon thereafter went to reside at Fillongley, near Shustoke, an estate formerly purchased for him by his father. In 1625 he purchased the manor of Blyth, in the parish of Shustoke, and, preferring it as a place of residence, removed thither in 1626. His inclination to the study of antiquities manifested itself at an early age, and received its first encouragement from Samuel Roper, a barrister of Lincoln’s Inn. After his settlement at Blyth Hall he made the acquaintance of some gentlemen interested in antiquities, who enabled him to obtain a sight of the old “deeds and evidences” of the county families of Warwickshire, and “divers antient writings of consequence,” with the view of his writing a history of that county. In 1635 he accompanied Sir Simon Archer to London, and was by him introduced to Sir Henry Spelman, which led to his acquaintance with Thomas, earl of Arundell, then earl marshal of England, by whom he was, in 1638, created a pursuivant of arms extraordinary by the name of Blanche Lyon, and in 1639 rouge-croix pursuivant in ordinary. About this time he agreed to write his work on Monastery Foundations, and, having a lodging in the Herald’s Office, he now spent much of his time in London in order to augment his collections out of the record j of the Tower and other places in the city. In 1641 Sir Christopher Hatton, a member of the House of Commons, dreading the near approach of the revolutionary storm which soon thereafter broke over England, and the ruin that might then ensue, got him to make exact drafts of all the monuments in Westminster Abbey and the principal churches in England, including Peterborough, Ely, Norwich, Lincoln, Newark, Beverley, Southwell, Kingston-upon-Hull, York, Selby, Chester, Lichfield, Tamworth, and Warwick. He received and obeyed, in June 1642, the summons of Charles I. to attend him at York, whither, on the outbreak of the revolution, the king had betaken himself for the sake of greater security. Learning the spread of the revolution in Warwickshire, Charles deputed him to summon to surrender the castle of Banbury, in Oxford, and the castle of Warwick, which were being rapidly filled with ammunition and rebels. Banbury obeyed, but Warwick, being better prepared, contemned the summons and its inmates were proclaimed traitors. He also summoned the city of Coventry; and, accompanying Sir Richard Willys as guide, he was present at the battle of Cudworth Field, the result of which he communicated to the king. He remained at Oxford with the king till the surrender of the garrison in 1646, and witnessed the battle of Edgehill, of the field of which he made afterwards an exact survey, noting how the armies were drawn up, and where and in what direction the various movements took place, and marking the graves of the slain. In November 1642 he was admitted M.A. of the university, and in 1644 the king created him Chester-Herauld. While at Oxford he made a journey to Worcester, where—with the purpose of increasing his collections for his history of Warwickshire—he perused the registers of the bishop and of the dean and chapter; and during his Oxford leisure he applied himself also to the search for antiquities in the libraries and in the private houses. When Oxford surrendered he continued his antiquarian researches in London along with Richard Dodsworth for their joint work on the monasteries, which was published successively in single volumes in 1655, 1664, and 1673. At the Restoration he obtained the office of Norroy king-at-arms, and in 1677 was created garter principal king-at-arms, and was knighted. He died at Blyth Hall, 10th February 1686.

Besides the works on Warwickshire, published in 1656, and Μoηαstieoη Anglieαnum, republished in 6 vols, in 1817-30, and again in 8 volumes in 1846, Sir William Dugdale is the author of History of St Paul's Cathedral (1658), the Baronage of England (3 vols. 1675-6), and other works of less importance. His life, written by himself up to 1678, with his diary and correspondence, and an index to his manuscript collections, was edited by William Hamper, and puolished in 1827.
