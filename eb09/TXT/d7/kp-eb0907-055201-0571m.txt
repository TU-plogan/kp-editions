DURAN, Augustin (1789-1862), one of the leaders of the literary movement in Spain during the present century, was born at Madrid, where his father held the post of court physician. He lost his mother in childhood, and, instead of being educated in the capital, was sent to the seminary at Vergara, rather to gain strength and health than such mathematics and Latin as his clerical teachers could supply. Thence he returned a firm believer in ghosts, and erudite in the traditions of Spanish romance. In 1817 he joined the university of Seville for the study of philosophy and law, and in due course was admitted an advocate at Valladolid. From 1821 to 1823 he held a post in the direccion general de estudios at Madrid; but in the latter year he was discarded on account of his political opinions, and it was not till 1834 that he received a new appointment as secretary of the board for the censorship of the press, shortly afterwards supplemented by a post in the National Library at Madrid. The revolution of 1840 again led to his dismissal; but he recovered his position in 1843, and in 1854 attained the rank of director of the library. Next year, however, he retired, and the rest of his life was devoted to his literary work. He died in 1862. It was in 1828, shortly after his first discharge from office, that he published his discourse on the influence which modern criticism had exercised on the ancient Spanish theatre {Discorso sobre il influjo que ha teηido la critica moderna en la decadeηcia del ieatro antiguo) ; and, though the work was anonymous, it produced a marvellous effect on the tendencies of the national drama. He next endeavoured to make better known to his fellow-countrymen those half-forgotten treasures of their literature, in the collection of which he had spared neither money nor toil. Five volumes of a Romancero general appeared from 1828 to 1832 (republished, with considerable additions and improvements, in 2 vols. 1849-1851), and Talia espailola, or a collection of old Spanish comedies, in 3 vols., in 1834. As an original poet the author is best known by a poem in imitation of the style of the 15th century, entitled Las très toronjas del vergel de amor., or “The Three Citron Trees of the Orchard of Love.”
