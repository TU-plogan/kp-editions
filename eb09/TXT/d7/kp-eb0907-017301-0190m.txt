DICK, Thomas (1775-1857), a popular writer on astronomy and other scientific subjects, was born in 1775. He was educated for the ministry in connection with the Secession (now United Presbyterian) Church of Scotland, and was ordained at Stirling in 1803. About two years afterwards his connection with the church was severed, and he became a teacher, first at Methven, a village in Perthshire, and afterwards at Perth. In 1824 he published in two volumes the Christian Philosopher, a work whose “aim was,” in his own words, “to illustrate the harmony which subsists between the system of nature and the system of revelation, and to show that the manifestations of God in the material universe ought to be blended with our view of the facts and doctrines recorded in the volume of inspiration.” The success of this work enabled him to resign his labours as teacher, and in 1827 he removed to Broughty Ferry, a suburb of Dundee, where he devoted his whole time to literary and scientific pursuits. Besides the Christian Philosopher, he is author of the Philosophy of a Future State (1828), the Improvement of Society by the Diffusion of Knowledge (1833), Celestial Scenery (1837), The Sidereal Heavens (1840), and several smaller treatises. These works were all intended to supplement and extend the aims of the Christian Philosopher, and may be regarded as endeavours by means of scientific discoveries toillustrate particular aspects of religious truth, and to suggest solutions of difficult religious problems. They are written in a popular and fascinating style, and manifest great aptitude for simplifying scientific subjects, and rendering them interesting to non-scientific readers. Some years before his death, which took place 27th July 1857, a pension was conferred on him by Government.
