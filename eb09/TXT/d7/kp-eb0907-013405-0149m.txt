DEUTZ (Latin, Tuitium), an old town of Rhenish Prussia, on the right bank of the Rhine, opposite to Cologne, with which it is connected by two bridges. It contains the church of St Heribert, built in the 17th century, a Protestant church, cavalry barracks, artillery magazines, and gas, porcelain, machine, and carriage factories. The fortifications of the town form part of the defences of Cologne. The population in 1875 was 14,513. To the east of Deutz is the manufacturing suburb of Kalk, with about 8,500 inhabitants. The old castle in Deutz was in 1002 made a Benedictine monastery by Heribert, archbishop of Cologne. Permission to fortify the town was in 1230 granted to the citizens by the archbishop of Cologne, between whom and the counts of Berg it was in 1240 divided. It was burnt in 1376, 1445, and 1583; and in 1678, after the peace of Nimeguen, the fortifications were demolished. They were rebuilt in 1816. See Cologne.
