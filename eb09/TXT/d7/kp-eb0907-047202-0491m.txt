DRÖSTE-HÜLSHOFF, Annette Elizabeth, Baroness of (1798-1848), a German poetess, was born on the estate of Hülshoff, near Munster, and belonged to the elder branch of the Catholic Westphalian family which about the same time had its reputation increased by the juridical labours of Clemens Augustus von Droste-Hülshoff. She received an education of a more scientific character than usually fell at that time to the lot of her sex; and the delicate state of her health obliged her to lead a very quiet and secluded life, which in its turn fostered the natural sensibility of her temperament, and increased her devotion to literature and study. With the exception of a short time spent at Cologne and Bonn about 1825, she mainly resided at her mother’s country seat of Rischhaus, near Munster; but in 1841 she went to the castle of Eppishausen, in Thuringia, and in 1844 became a guest at the house of her brother-in-law Von Lassberg, on the borders of the Lake of Constance. She had just purchased an estate in that neighbourhood when she died in May 1848. Besides a volume of Gedichte published during her lifetime (Stuttgart, 1844), we have also from her pen Das geistliche Jahr, nebst einem Anhang religiöser Gedichte, Stuttgart, 1852; and Letzte Gaben, Hanover, 1860. The popularity of the first work is shown by a third edition in 1873. The characteristics of the author are great perfection of form, delicacy of feeling, and vivid realization of external nature. A number of her poems have been rendered into English by Medwin. See Schücking, Annette von Droste-HUlshoff, Ein Lebensbild, 1871
