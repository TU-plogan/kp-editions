DIET (German, Reichstag), The origin of the German Diet is to be sought in the national assembly, which was a common institution of the Teutonic race. From the earliest recorded times we find all leading questions first discussed by the chiefs and then referred to the assembly of the clan or tribe, in which every freeman had a voice.

The earliest Diets of the German or Holy Roman Empire were assemblies in which the monarch deliberated with his subjects on the common interests of the empire. Originally all members were bound by their feudal tenure to be present, and if absent they not only forfeited their vote but were liable to fine. Thus the Diet was a feudal, not a representative, Parliament. As by degrees the feudatories of the emperor turned into independent sovereigns, the Diet became nothing more than a congress of princes. The emperor, instead of presiding in person, was represented by a delegate called principal commissarius, and the princes sent envoys, the right of suffrage being no longer personal, but attached to certain territories or districts.

At first the emperor was, in theory at least, elected by universal suffrage; a candidate was chosen by the chief men, and their nominee approved by the people. Thus we read that at the election of Conrad II. 50,000, and at that of Lothaire II. 60,000 persons were present. In time this custom of nominating the emperor grew into an established right, which, under the name of praetaxatian, was arrogated by the chief princes of the empire. Thus the chief function of the Diet, the choice of an emperor, became the prerogative of a few of its most powerful members, who claimed the right not only of election but of deposition. Thus in 1298 Adolphus of Nassau was deposed, and Albert of Austria chosen in his stead. The right of the electors and the forms and rules of election were defined and settled by the famous instrument of Charles IV. known as the Golden Bull, 1356.

The Diet consisted of three bodies, who met and voted in separate colleges,—(1) the electoral college, (2) the princes of the empire spiritual and temporal, (3) the free imperial cities.

1. In a law of Otho IV. (1208), we find the right of electing an emperor vested in the electoral college of seven. These consisted of three spiritual princes—the archbishops of Mentz, Treves, and Cologne,—and four secular electors —the duke of Saxony, the count palatine of the Rhine, the king of Bohemia, and the margrave of Brandenburg. The former sat as recognized heads of the German church. The latter would naturally have been the dukes of Saxony, Franconia, Swabia, and Bavaria; but when Bavaria was united with the county palatine its. right was transferred to Bohemia; that of Swabia was, on the accession of Frederick (who by his election was incapacitated from voting), delegated to Brandenburg, and by it retained; and probably that of Franconia was for similar reason forfeited (see Dunham, Germanic Empire, i. 216).

2. The princes of the empire had in all other respects, save that of electing an emperor, the same rights as the dukes or electors. They consisted of the archbishop of Salzburg, 20 bishops, 4 abbots, and 2 prebendaries, and of 44 temporal princes, though this number was afterwards largely augmented. Of these several, such as the archduke of Austria, and the dukes of Brunswick and Burgundy, were in rank and power more than equals of the electors.

3. The free imperial cities formed a college divided into two benches,—the Swabian, with 37 cities, and the Rhenish, with 14. They first appear at the Diet under Henry VIL, but their position was not recognized till the peace of Westphalia. The power exercised by this municipal constituent of the Diet was small and strictly limited. Only what had been agreed upon by the electors and princes could be submitted to the college of cities for their sanction. The lower nobility, the knights of the empire, and the commons were unrepresented.

Each college voted separately; when the three colleges agreed, the decree or recess of the Diet, as it was called, was submitted to the emperor for his ratification; but the emperor had no power to modify it, and no resolution which affected the general interests of the empire could be passed without the approbation of the Diet.

Besides extraordinary meetings, the Diet was regularly convened twice a year. At the spring session the general business of the empire was discussed, laws were passed, alliances concluded, rebels proscribed, and grants of fiefs confirmed. The autumn session was occupied with finance and attended only by dukes, counts, and officers of administration. From 1663 the Diet met at Regensburg.

From the end of the Thirty Years’ War the power of the Diet steadily declined. The Peace of Westphalia, while confirming the rights of the Diet as against the emperor, at the same time, by recognizing the territorial independence of the German princes, so limited the province of the federative assembly that, to quote the words of Frederick the Great, the Diet became “a mere shadow, a congress of publicists more busied with forms than things, like dogs who bay the moon.”

The most important Diets were the following :—
