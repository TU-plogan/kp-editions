DIONYSIUS, the Younger, ascended the throne of Syracuse at his fatherâ€™s death, in 367 b.c. He was driven from the kingdom by Dion, and fled to Locri; but during the commotions which followed the assassination of that leader, he managed to make himself master of Syracuse. On the arrival of Timoleon he was compelled to surrender and retire to Corinth (343 b,c.), where he spent the rest of his days in poverty.
