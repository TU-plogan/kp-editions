DÜNABURG, a town of European Russia, at the head of a district in the government of Vitebsk, for the most part on the right bank of the Dwina, 12 miles south-east of Riga, in 55’ 53' N. lat. and 31° 29' 9" E. long. It consists of four portions—the main-town or fortress, the old suburb, the new suburb, and on the left bank of the river the village of Grive. The fortress is of the first class, and forms the most important point in the line of defences of the Dwina; the floating bridge across the river is protected by a splendid tete-de-poni. Among the public buildings are five churches, a Roman Cathohc chapel, a Jewish synagogue, a gymnasium, and a theatre; and among the industrial establishments several tanneries and breweries, a saw-mill, a flour-mill, brick and tile works, and limekilns. Its position on the railway between Warsaw and St Petersburg, and its double means of communication with Riga, render the town an important commercial centre, especially for the trade in flax, hemp, tallow, and timber. There are weekly markets and two large annual fairs. Of the'25,674 inhabitants registered in 1861, 7561 were Jews, 3994 Roman Catholics, and 690 Protestante. In 1873 the total population was 29,613.

I)iinaburg was originally founded in 1278 by the Livonian Knights of the Sword, about 12 miles further down the river than its present site, at a spot still known as the Old Castle or Storni Zαmok. In 1559, along with other portions of the territory belonging to the order, it was moιtgaged by the grand-master Gothard Kettler to Sigismund Augustus king of Poland for the sum of 700,000 guldens; and two years afterwards it became the centre of the new Polish province of Infland. Captured in 1576 by Ivan the Terrible, it was again restored to Poland; and in 1582 Stephen Bathori transferred the fortress to its present site. In the 17th century it was held now by the Swedes and now by the Russians; and in 1656 it ran the risk of losing its old name for that of Borissoglebsk, bestowed by the emperor Alexis Michaelovitch. Finally incorporated with Russia in 1772, it received its present administrative rank in 1777, and its recognition as a first-class fortress in 1811. In July 1812 the tête-de-pont was vainly stormed by Oudinot, but a few weeks afterwards the town was captured by Macdonald.
