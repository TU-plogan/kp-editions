DOXOLOGY, a hymn in praise of the Almighty. The name is often applied to the Trisagion, or “Holy, Holy, Holy,” the scriptural basis of which is found in Isaiah vi. 3; to the Hallelujah of several of the Psalms and of Rev. xix.; and to the last clause of the Lord’s Prayer according to Saint Matthew, which critics are generally agreed in regarding as an interpolation. It is used, however, more definitely as the designation of two hymns distinguished by liturgical writers as the Greater and Lesser Doxologies. The origin and history of these it is impossible to trace fully. The germ of both is to be found in the Gospels; the first words of the Greater Doxology, or Gloria in Excelsis, being taken from Luke ii. 14, and the form of the Lesser Doxology, or Gloria Patri, having been in all probability first suggested by Matt, xxviii. 19. The Greater Doxology, in a form approximating to that of the English prayer-book, is given in the Apostolical Constitutions (vii. 47). This is the earliest record of it, unless, indeed, the Apostolical Constitutions be taken to be of a later date than the Alexandrine Codex, where the hymn also occurs. Alcuin attributes the authorship of the Latin form—the Gloria in Excelsis — to St Hilary of Poitiers (died 368), but this is at best only a plausible conjecture. The quotations from the hymn in the De Virginitate of Athanasius, and in Chrysostom (Hom. 69 in ΛfattJιf), include only the opening words (those from St Luke’s gospel), though the passage in Athanasius shows by an et caetera that only the commencement of the hymn is given. These references indicate that the hymn was used in private devotions; as it does not appear in any of the earliest liturgies, whether ‘Eastern or Western, its introduction into the public services of the church was probably of a later date than has often been supposed. Its first introduction into the Roman liturgy is due to Pope Symmachus (498-514), who ordered it to be sung on Sundays and festival days. The Mozarabic liturgy provides for its eucharistie use on Sundays and festivals. In these and other early liturgies the Greater Doxology occurs immediately after the commencement of the service; in the English prayer-book it is introduced at the close of the communion office, but it does not occur in either the morning or evening service. The Lesser Doxology, or Gloria Patri, combines the character of a creed with that of a hymn. In its earliest form it ran simply—“Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, world without end, Amen,” or “Glory be to the Father, in or by the Son, and by the Holy Ghost.” Until the rise of the Arian heresy these forms were probably regarded as indifferent, both being equally capable of an orthodox interpretation. When the Arians, however, finding the second form more consistent with their views, adopted it persistently and exclusively, its use was naturally discountenanced by the Catholics, and the other form became the symbol of orthodoxy. To the influence of the Arian heresy is also obviously due the addition of the clause—“as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be,” the use of which was, according to some authorities, expressly enjoined by the Council of Nicaea. There is no sufficient evidence of this, but there exists a decree of the second Council of Vaison (529), asserting its use as already established in the East propter haereticorum, astutiam, and ordering its adoption throughout the churches of the West. In the Western Church the Gloria Patri is repeated at the close of every psalm, in the Eastern church at the close of the last psalm.
