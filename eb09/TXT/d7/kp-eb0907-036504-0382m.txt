DORDOGNE, an inland department in the S.E. of France, taking its name from the river which traverses its centre from east to west, and formed from nearly the whole of Périgord, a part of Agénais, and small portions of Limousin and of Angoumois. It is bounded od the N. by Haute Vienne, W. by Charente and Charente Inférieure, S.W. by Gironde, S. by Lot-et-Garonne, and E. by Lot and Corrèze, and lies between 44° 45' and 45° 42' N. lat., and from 0° Γ 51" to 1° 26' 49" W. long. Its surface is beautifully variegated, comprising small mountains, —some [9:7:366] of which are covered with vines and crowned with wood, and others rocky and barren,—large plateaus, and a few pleasant valleys. In the north it is wild and sterile, and in the west is covered with forests of pine, but the splendid valley watered by the Dordogne is rich in vines, fruit trees, and cereals. The climate is generally agreeable and healthy, but rather humid, especially in the south. Dordogne is watered by 11 rivers and more than 600 streams, all tributaries of the Dordogne except the Bandiat and the Dropt. The Dordogne itself is formed by the union of two mountain streams, the Dor and the Dogne, which rise in Mont d’Or, Puy-de-Dôme, and unite after a short course. Sufficient corn is grown in the department for home consumption. The cultivation of the vine occupies about a tenth of its surface, and its red and white wines are in high repute. Its truffles are considered the best in France. In the forests the prevailing trees are the oak and chestnut. The fruit of -the latter is much used both as food by the people and for fattening hogs. The walnut is extensively cultivated for making oil. Dordogne is rich in various kinds of minerals; iron is very abundant, and there are found also copper, lead, manganese, coal, marble, alabaster, lithographic stones, lime of gypsum, &c. The chief branches of industry are the working in metals, particularly iron and steel, the manufacture of paper, and boat-building; but there are also produced coarse woollens, serges, leather, earthenware, hosiery, vinegar, brandy, and liqueurs. Dordogne is divided into the arrondissments Périgueux, Bergerac, Nontron, Riberac, and Sarlat, with 47 cantons and 582 communes. The chief town is Périgueux. The total area is 3545 square miles, and the population in 1872 numbered 480,142.
