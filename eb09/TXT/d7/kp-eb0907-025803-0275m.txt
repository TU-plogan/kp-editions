DISLOCATION. This term is applied in surgery to the displacement from each other of the cartilaginous or articular surfaces of the bones entering into the formation of a joint. In a normal joint these surfaces are in contact and held together by ligaments and muscles; in a dislocated joint they are separated more or less completely—in the great majority of cases by external violence; in some instances, however, by powerful muscular exertion. The ease with which a joint is dislocated varies with the form and structure of the joint and with the position in which the joint is when the force is applied. The relative frequency of fracture and dislocation depends on the strength of the bones above and below the joint relatively to the strength of the joint. These points may be illustrated by examples from the joints of the arm and leg, because, with perhaps the exception of the joint between the lower jaw and the skull, it is in these situations that dislocation is most frequently observed. The strength of the different joints in the body is dependent on either ligament, muscle, or the shape of the bones. In the hip, for instance, all three sources of strength are present; therefore, considering the great leverage of the long thigh bone, the hip is rarely dislocated. The shoulder, in order to allow of extensive movement, has no osseous or ligamentous strength; its strength is muscular, therefore it is frequently dislocated, because the muscular strength varies in power, the muscles may be relaxed, the person is unprepared, and dislocation occurs; if, on the other hand, the muscles are tense, and the patient is prepared for the strain, then the result will be either a sprain of the joint or a fracture of one of the adjoining bones. The wrist and ankle are rarely dislocated; in the wrist the radius gives way, in the ankle the fibula, these bones being relatively weaker than the respective joints. The wrist owes its strength to ligament, the ankle to the shape of the bones. The elbow is osseously strong, but this strength necessarily varies with the position of the arm. The symptoms of a dislocation are distortion and limited movement, with absence of the grating sensation felt in fracture when the extremities of a broken bone are rubbed together. The treatment consists in reducing the dislocation. The sooner this is done the better —the longer the delay the more difficult it becomes to remedy the displacement. After a variable period, depending on the nature of the joint and the age of . the person, it may be impossible to replace the bones. The result will be a more or less useless joint. The administration of chloroform, by relaxing the muscles, greatly assists the operation of reduction. The length of time that a joint has to be kept quiet after it has been restored to its normal shape depends on its form; if osseously strong, then early movement is allowable, as in the elbow joint; if osseously weak, then early movement is unjustifiable. More especially ⅛ this the case when, associated with osseous [9:7:259] weakness, the strength of the joint is ligamentous, as in the sterno-clavicular and superior radio-ulnar articulations. In such j oints the bones must be kept in accurate position and at rest for a lengthened period; if movement is allowed soon after the accident the bone will again slip out of its place.
