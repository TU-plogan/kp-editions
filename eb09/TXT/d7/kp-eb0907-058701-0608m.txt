DYVEKE, in German often Diiveke, and in the Latin chronicles Columbella, the “Little Dove,” the name by which the mistress of Christian II. of Denmark is invariably designated. Her father was a certain Sigbrit Villums, who had been obliged for political reasons to leave his native country of Holland. Settling at Bergen, he opened an inn, which soon became known for something more than the hospitality of the host or the excellence of his cheer: his daughter’s beauty was bush enough for his weakest wine. Valkendorp, the chancellor, did not think it unbecoming of his priestly character to sound her praise in the ears of the young crown-prince; and accordingly, when he visited Bergen in 1507, the prince made a point of seeing the “Little Dove” for himself. In matters of this sort there is unquestionably a royal road; and so having danced with her at a ball or two, he had little difficulty in getting her to leave the inn for a house of her own at Oslo. She followed him to Copenhagen on his accession in 1513, and both her father and mother obtained unusual influence at court. In 1515 the young king, indeed, was constrained from reasons of state to marry Isabella, the sister of Charles V.; but in spite of the emperor’s remonstrance, his relations with Dyveke and her parents underwent no real alteration till her sudden death in 1517. That she had been poisoned was the natural verdict of the popular feeling; and the royal suspicion fell on Torben Oxa, warden of the castle of Copenhagen, who was known to have made love to the girl before she was carried off by the prince; and was it not true that two days before her death he had sent her a present of cherries 1 It mattered not that the culprit was declared innocent by the royal council: “though his neck were as thick as the neck of a bull it should not save his head,” raged the king; and he kept his word. Such is the story, not altogether authenticated, which has furnished a favourite theme to dramatist and novelist. Samsoë the Danish poet, published his well-known tragedy “Dyveke ’ in the close of the 18th century, and it was translated bj Manthey into German in 1798. Münch treated the subject in a semi-historical manner in his Biograph -histor. Studien, Hermann Marggraff’s tragedy of Das TaubJιen von Amsterdam appeared in 1839, Rickhoff’s Duνeke in 1842, Hauch’s Wilhelm Zabern in 1834, Ida Frick’s Sybreclα Willums in 1843, and Mosenthal’s Diiveke in 1860.
