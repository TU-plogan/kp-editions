DUBNO, a town in European Russia, at the head of a department in the government of Volhynia, 154 miles west of Zhitomir, in 50° 25' N. lat. and 25° 44' E. long. Occupying a peninsula formed by the River Ivka, it is almost surrounded by water and marsh; and in its eastern corner it is defended by a somewhat dilapidated citadel separated by dry ditches from the rest of the town. It also possesses five Greek churches, of which two—the Transfiguration and the Exaltation of the Holy Rood—were formerly monasteries; it has also a Roman Catholic church and convent, a Jewish synagogue, a hospital for poor Jews, and various other J ewish institutions. Beer, mead, tobacco, bricks, and leather are all manufactured in the town; but a large number of the inhabitants, who are mainly of Jewish blood, obtain their living in other places.

Dubno is first mentioned in the chronicles under the name of Duben in 1100, when it formed one of the towns offered to David of Vladimir in compensation for the loss of his principality. In 1498 it received a charter from the grand duke of Lithuania, which was afterwards changed about 1507 for the Magdeburg rights. The Tatars, against whose attacks it had been fortified in the beginning of the century, laid waste the neighbourhood in 1577, but were gallantly repulsed from the town by Yanush of Ostrog. In 1793 it passed into the possession of the Liubomir family, to whom the most of the ground-rent is still due; in 1795 it was incorporated with Russia, and in 1796 it received its present rank. Population, 7600.
