DURRA, or Indian Millet, Sorghum vulgare, is a species of grass of the tribe Androρogoneoe. The terms durra and zurrut are applied to the plant in Arabia; in India it is known as>jawari (Hindustani), jowari (Bengali), cholum (Tamil), and joηna (Telugu), and in the West Indies as Negro or Guinea Corn. It is a strong grass, growing to a height of from 4 to 8 or even 16 feet; the leaves are sheathing, solitary, and about 2 inches broad and 2⅜ feet in length; the panicles are contracted, dense, and hermaphrodite; and the seeds, which are inclosed in husks, and protected by awns, are round, hard, smooth, shining, brownish-red, and somewhat larger than mustard seeds. The plant is cultivated in various parts of India and other countries of Asia, in the United States, and in the south of Europe. Its culms and leaves afford excellent fodder for cattle; and the grain, of which the yield in favourable situations is upwards of a hundredfold, is used for the same purposes as maize, rice, corn, and other cereals. Allied species are S. bicolor, much valued in India as a forageplant, and S. saccharatum, commonly called sorghum or Chinese sugar cane, which is extensively cultivated in China, North India, and Africa. The latter species is grown in America chiefly for the manufacture of molasses from its juice, and in France as a source of alcohol. The total quantity of sorghum molasses made in the United States in 1870 has been estimated at 16,050,089 gallons.
