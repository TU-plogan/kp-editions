DODDRIDGE, Philip (1702-1751), a celebrated nonconformist divine, was born in 1702. His father, Daniel Doddridge, was a London merchant, and his mother the orphan daughter of the Rev. John Bauman, a Bohemian clergyman who had fled to England to escape religious persecution, and had held for some time the mastership of the grammar school at Kingston-upon-Thames. He was the youngest of a family of twenty, of whom there was at his birth only one other child, a daughter, surviving. It is also remarkable that he himself at his birth was put aside as actually dead, and was only preserved alive owing to the accidental glance of one of the attendants, who fancied she perceived a feeble heaving of the infant’s chest, and was successful in rekindling the almost extinguished vital spark. Before he could read, his mother taught him the history-of the Old and New Testament by the assistance of some blue Dutch tiles; and these stories, he says, were the means of enforcing such good impressions on his heart as never afterwards wore out. When sufficiently old to leave the paternal roof he was placed under the tuition of the Rev. Mr Scott, who taught a private school in London, and on attaining his tenth year he was sent to the grammar school at Kingston-upon-Thames. About 1715 he was removed to a private school at St Albans, where he began to keep an exact account of his time in order the better to improve himself by private meditation and study, and was in the habit during his walks of entering the neighbouring cottages to read to the inmates a few pages from the Bible or from some religious book. Through the interest of friends a proposal was made to him, in 1719, which would have enabled him to enter the English bar; but receiving at the same time an invitation to study for the ministry, he preferred the latter, and shortly thereafter removed to the academy for dissenters at Kibworth in Leicestershire, taught at that time by the Rev. John Jennings. Mr Jennings having in 1722 received an invitation to Hinckley, the academy was removed thither; and in 1723 Doddridge, having finished his studies, accepted an invitation to succeed him in the ministry at Kibworth. He had also been mentioned by Jennings, who died in 1723, as the person most fitted to extend his plans and views as an instructor of candidates for the ministry, but it was not till 1729 that, at a general meeting of nonconformist ministers, he was chosen to conduct the academy established in that year at Harborough. In the same year he received an invitation from the congregation at Northampton, which he accepted. Here he continued his ministrations till 1751, when the rapid progress of consumptive disease caused him to seek the advantages of a milder climate. Accordingly he sailed for Lisbon on the 30th September of that year; but the change was unavailing, and he died there on 26 th October.

His popularity as a preacher is said to have been chiefly due to his “high susceptibility, joined with physical advantages and perfect sincerity.” His sermons were mostly practical in character, and his great aim was to cultivate in his hearers a spiritual and devotional frame of mind. “He endeavoured,” he says, “to write on the common general principles of Christianity, and not in the narrow spirit of any particular party.” “There is,” says his biographer, “a remarkable delicacy and caution evinced in the works of Dr Doddridge whenever the subject approaches the disputed points of theology. The genuine expressions of the sacred writers are then employed, and the reader is allowed to draw his own conclusions, unbiassed by the prejudices of human authorities.” Those portions of his theological lectures which treat on the matter alluded to, substantiate this statement. His principal works are The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul, The Family Expositor, Life of Colonel Gardiner, and a Course of Metaphysical, Ethical, and Theological Lectures. He also published several courses of sermons on particular topics, and is the author of many well-known hymns.
