DONATI, Giovanni Battista, professor of astronomy at the Royal Institution of Florence, was born at Pisa, December 16, 1826, and died at Florence, September 20, 1873. In 1852 he became an assistant at the Florentine observatory, of which in 1864 he was appointed director. On June 2, 1858, he discovered the comet which bears his name (see vol. ii. p. 815). Other comets were discovered by him on June 3, 1855, November 10,1857, and July 23 and September 9,1864. He made numerous spectroscopic observations of comets and the solar disc, aud in 1862 published diagrams of three or four lines in the spectra of fifteen stars. The new observatory on the hill of Arcetri, near Florence, was erected under his superintendence, and was directed by him. At the time of his death Donati had just returned from Vienna, where he was the representative of Italy in the international meteorological congress.
