DINÁJPUR, a district of British India, within the Rájsháhí Kuch-Behar division or commissionership, under the lieutenant-governor of Bengal, is situated between 24’ 43'° 40" and 26° 22' 50" N. lat., and between 88° 4' 0" and 89 21' 5" E. long. The district, which occupies an area of 4126 square miles, is a triangular tract of country with the acute angle towards the north, lying between the districts of Jalpáigurí and Rangρur on the E., and Purniah on the W.; on the S. it is bounded by the districts of Bográ, Rájsháhí, and Maldah. The country is generally flat, but towards the south becomes undulating, some of the elevations being about 100 feet in height. The district is traversed in every direction by a network of channels and water courses. Along the banks of the Kulik river, the undulating ridges and long lines of mango-trees give the landscape an aspect of beauty which is not found elsewhere.

Dinájpur forms part of the rich arable tract lying between the Ganges and the southern slopes of the Himálayas. Although essentially a fluvial district, it does not possess any river navigable throughout the year by boats of 4 tons burden. Rice forms the staple agricultural product. It consists of three species, the áman or winter rice (the great harvest of the year), the áus or autumn rice, and the boro or spring rice. The áman and áus rice are each subdivided into several varieties. The other crops are oats, barley, millet, maize, oilseeds, pulses, jute, sugar-cane, betel leaf, tobacco, and vegetables. The imperial road from Barhampur to Dárjíling runs through the district for a distance of about 130 miles, and the new Northern Bengal State Railway intersects the district for about 30 miles. The climate of the district, although cooler than that of Calcutta, is very unhealthy, and the people have a sickly appearance. The worst part of the year is at the close of the rains in September and October, during which months few of the natives escape fever. The average maximum temperature is 92 , 3°, and the minimum 74 ’ 8°. The average rainfall is 85 - 54 inches. The population in 1872 amounted to 1,501,924 souls, equal to 364 persons per square mile,—the Hindus forming 46 ’ 8 per cent., and the Mahometans 52 ’ 8 per cent.

Dinájpur, the principal town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated on the east bank of the Purnabhábá river, in 25° 38' 0" N. lat. and 88° 40' 46" E. long. The town seems to have declined in importance of late years. In 1808 it was estimated to contain 5000 houses; the census of 1872 returned only 3031. Population in 1872 :—Hindus, 5847; Mahometans, 7016; Christians, 99; others, 80 :—total (7700 males and 5342 females), 13,042. The disparity in the proportion of the sexes arises from the fact that many of the shopkeepers and traders have houses in the country where they leave their wives and children.
