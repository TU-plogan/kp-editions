DERÁ GHÁZI KHÁN, a district of British India, in the Deraját division of the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, is situated between 28° 27' 0'' and 31° Γ 0" N. lat. and 69° 36' 30'' and 70° 58' 20" E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Derá Ismáil Khán, on the E. by the Indus, on the S. by Jacobábád in Sind, and on the W. by the Suláimán range of hills. The district is a long narrow strip of country, 198 miles in length,^[1. The area of the district is returned at 4950 square miles, or 3,168,000 acres, of which 2,412,749 acres were under assessment in 1872-73. The cultivated area amounts to 1662 square miles, oι 1,063,680 acres, or 33’57 per cent of the total area. Of the cultivated area 427,599 acres, or 40’24 per cent., are irrigated. The first regular land settlement of the district was concluded in 1872. ] sloping gradually from the hills which form its western boundary to the River Indus on the east. Below the hills the country is high and arid, generally level, but sometimes rolling in sandy undulations, and much intersected by hill torrents, 201 in number. With the exception of two, these streams dry up after the rains, and their influence is only felt for a few miles below the hills. The eastern portion of the district is at a level sufficiently low to benefit by the floods of the Indus. A barren tract intervenes between these zones, and is beyond the reach of the hill streams on the one hand and of the Indus on the other. Although liable to great extremes of temperature, and to a very scanty rainfall, the district is not unhealthy. The rainfall in 1872-73 was 7 ’ 7 inches; the mean temperature 79° Fahr. The maximum temperature (H2°) occurred in June, the minimum (40°) in December. The principal agricultural products are wheat, great millet, joár, cotton, rice, and indigo. The poppy plant is also rather extensively cultivated in the south of the district. The less important food grains are barley, spiked millet (bájrá), and pulses. Oil seeds and tobacco are also grown to a small extent.

cultivationmainlydependsupon artificial irrigation, effected principally by canals leading from the Indus. In 1872-73 there were 15 main canals, drawing their supply direct from the Indus, of which 2 were the property of private in-viduals, and 13 were under the management of Government. Alum, earth salt, and raggi (an impure carbonate of soda) are manufactured in some quantities. The exports are indigo, opium, salt, dates, wheat, cotton, barley, millet, ghi, and hides. The imports are sugar, fruits from Cabul, gram, woollen goods, English piece goods and broad cloth, metals, salt, and spices. The total revenue of the district in 1872-73, exclusive of local funds and canal collections, amounted to £45,161, of which £35,588, or 79 per cent., was derived from the land. The administrative staff of the district consists of a deputy commissioner, with two assistants and one extra assistant, four tahsildárs, each with a deputy or assistant, a district superintendent of police, and two civil surgeons. The police force numbered 733 men. There are 85 schools, maintained or assisted by the state, and 132 indigenous village schools—total 167, attended in 1872-73 by 2907 pupils. Three charitable dispensaries afford gratuitous medical relief. The principal town of the district, and chief seat of commerce, is Derá Gházi Khán, situated on the west bank of the Indus, 30° 4' lat., 70° 51' long. Population in 1868 :—Mahometans, 10,699; Hindus, 8850; Sikhs, 328; Christians, 52; “others,” 194—total, 20,123. The other towns containing a population exceeding 5000 souls are Jámpur, population 7796; Choti, population 7300; Dágil, population 5693; and Rájhan, population 5656. Rájanpur, although not containing 5000 inhabitants, is important as a cantonment, a regiment of cavalry and two companies of infantry being stationed there. The foregoing towns are all municipalities.

The census of 1868 returned the population as follows :— Mahometans, 264,527; Hindus, 38,467; Sikhs, 1124; “others,” 4722; total 308,840. The Beluchis, who are Mahometans, form by far the most important section of the population, and number 82,590. The Játs, who are also Mahometans, are the most numerous, numbering 162,519. Among the Hindu population, the Aroras form the most important caste, 33,024 in number, principally traders. Of the total population, 164,729, or 53 per cent., are returned as agriculturists.
