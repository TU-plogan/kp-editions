DUDLEY, a parliamentary and municipal borough of England, in a detached portion of the county of Worcestershire surrounded by the county of Stafford. It lies in the centre of the “Black Country,” about eight miles W.N.W. of Birmingham, at a junction on the Great Western railway. The town is generally well-built, its streets are well-paved, and there is a fair supply of water. The principal buildings are the parish church of St Thomas, rebuilt in 1819 at a cost of .£23,000, and restored in 1862; several other churches, of which the most recent is St Luke’s, erected in 1876; the town-hall, the county court, the Guest hospital (formerly the blind asylum), endowed (1868) by Joseph Guest,.with a legacy of £20,000 (1861), the school of art, the new dispensary (1868), and the mechanics’ institute (1861). Among the educational establishments are a free grammar-school, a subscription library, and a geological society with a small scientific museum. On a hill to the north are the extensive remains of an ancient castle, surrounded by beautiful grounds; and in the market-place stands a fountain, erected by the earl of Dudley at a cost of £3000, on the occasion of his marriage. The presence of coal, iron-ore, and limestone gives its peculiar character to the industries of the place. According to the census of 1871, 5442 men were engaged in the iron manufacture, 1040 as makers of engines or machines, and 3501 in the coal-mines; while the nail manufacture alone gave employment to 1267 males and 3019 females. Among the various articles produced are fire-irons, stoves, shovels, edge tools, chains, anchors, and especially anvils and vices. The glass-works, brass foundries, and brickworks are also of importance; and tanning, brewing, and malting are extensively carried on. The parliamentary borough has an area of 7715 acres, and returns one member to Parliament. In 1871 the population of the municipal borough, which has an area of 3680 acres, was 43,782; that of the parliamentary borough was 82,249.

Dudley castle, according to an unfounded tradition preserved by Camden, was first built about 700 by a Mercian prince called Dodo. It is mentioned in Domesday book as belonging after the conquest to William Fitz Ansculf. Being held in 1138 for the empress Maud by Ralphe Paganel, it was burnt by Stephen. In 1161 Gervase, Ralphe’s son, founded a priory for Cluniac monks, about a quarter of a mile to the west of the castle, at a spot still distinguished by a few ruins. The lordship was afterwards held by the Somerys, and the Suttons; and from the latter family it was transferred by marriage to the Wards of Bixley. John Ward, sixth Baron Dudley, was in 1763 created Viscount Dudley and Ward; and in 1827 John William, the fourth viscount, was created Earl Dudley. The title died with him in 1833, but was restored in 1860 in favour of William, his second cousin. The description Sir Amyas Pawlet gives of the town in 1585 is—“one of the poorest towns 1 have seen in my life.” On its surrender to the Parliament in 1646-7 the fortifications of the castle were demolished, but it continued habitable to 1750, when a fire broke out which reduced it to its present ruinous state. Dudley was enfranchised in 1832 by 2 Will. IV. c. 45; and it received incorporation in 1865. See Booker’s History of Dudley, and Twamley’s History of Dudley Castle and Priory, 1867.
