DEMMIN, a town of Prussia, at the head of a circle in the government of Stettin, is situated on the Peene, which in the immediate neighbourhood receives the Trebel and the Tollense, 72 miles W.N.W. of Stettin. It has manufactures of woollen cloths, linens, hats, and hosiery, besides breweries, distilleries, and tanneries, and an active trade in corn and timber. Demmin is a town of Slavonian origin and of considerable antiquity, and was a place of importance in the time of Charlemagne. It was besieged by a German army in 1148, and captured by Henry the Lion in 1164. In the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War it was the object of frequent conflicts, and even after the Peace of Westphalia was taken and retaken in the contest between the electoral prince and the Swedes. It passed to Prussia in 1720, and its fortifications were destroyed in 1759. In 1807 several engagements took place in the vicinity between the French and Russians. Population in 1875, 9856.
