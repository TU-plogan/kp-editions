DUPONT DE L’EURE, Jacques Charles (1767-1855), a French lawyer and statesman, was born at Neubourg, in Normandy, on the 27th February 1767. In 1789 he was an advocate at the Parliament of Normandy. During the republic and the empire he filled successively judicial offices at Louviers, Rouen, and Evreux. He had adopted the principles of the Revolution, andin 1798 he commenced his political life as a member of the Council of Five Hundred. In 1813 he became a member of the Corps Legislatif. During the Hundred Days he was vice-president of the Chamber of Deputies, and when the allied armies entered Paris he distinguished himself by the firmness with which he asserted the necessity of maintaining the principles of government that had been established at the Revolution. A resolution to that effect which he moved in the chamber was adopted, and he was chosen one of the commissioners to negotiate with the allied sovereigns. From 1817 till 1849 he was uninterruptedly a member of the Chamber of Deputies, and he acted consistently with the liberal opposition, of which at more than one crisis he was the virtual leader. For a few months in 1830 he held office as minister of justice, but, finding himself out of harmony with his colleagues, he resigned before the close of the vear and [9:7:550] resumed his place in the opposition. At the revolution of 1848 Dupont de ΓEure was made president of the provisional government as being its oldest member. In the following year, having failed to secure his re-election to the chamber, he retired into private life. He died in 1855 at the age of eighty-eight. The consistent firmness with which he adhered to the cause of constitutional liberalism during the many changes of his times gained him the highest respect of his countrymen, by whom he was styled the Aristides of the French tribune.
