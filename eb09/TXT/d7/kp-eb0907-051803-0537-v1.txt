DUHAMEL DU MONCEAU, Henry Louis (1700- 1782), a celebrated French botanist and agriculturist, was the son of Alexandre Duhamel, lord of Denainvilliers, and was born at Paris in 1700. He was placed at the Collége d’Harcourt, but made little progress in his studies, except that, notwithstanding the imperfect manner in which the natural sciences were there taught, he acquired such a taste for these branches of knowledge as led him to attend the lessons of Dufay and Bernard de Jussieu at the Jardin des Plantes. He now spent his time between the capital, where he pursued his botanical studies and held intercourse with scientists, and his estates at Gâtinais, where he employed his knowledge in arboricultural experiments. Having been requested by the Academy of Sciences to investigate the cause of the disease which was destroying the saffron plant in Gâtinais, he discovered that its destruction was owing to a parasitical fungus which attached itself to its roots. The work in which he demonstrated his discovery was judged worthy to appear in the transactions of the Academy, and gained him admission to that· body iu 1728. From then until his death he busied himself chiefly with making experiments in vegetable physiology, and recording and publishing his observations. Having learned from Sir Hans Sloane that madder possesses the property of giving colour to the bones, he fed animals successively on food mixed and unmiκed with madder; and he fomιd that their bones in general exhibited concentric strata of red and white, whilst the softer parts showed in the meantime signs of having been progressively extended. From a number of experiments he was led to believe himself able to explain the growth of bones, and to demonstrate a parallel between the manner of their growth and that of trees. Along with the celebrated naturalist Buffon, he made numerous experiments on the growth and strength of wood, one of the results of which was that he recommended the bark to be taken off the trees several years before they are cut down. He experimented also on the growth of the mistletoe, on layer planting, on smut in corn, and on the production of soda and potash by different vegetables. From the year 1740 he made meteorological observations, and kept records of the influence of the weather on agricultural production. Having been appointed inspector-general of marine, he applied his scientific acquirements to the improvement of nautical knowledge, subjecting everything to the test of facts and experiments. Duhamel’s aim in his researches waβ rather to be useful than to gratify his own curiosity or to win fame. He made himself accessible to all who sought information from him, aud his modesty was as great as his knowledge. He was scrupulous in the practice of his religious duties. He died August 13, 1782.

His works are generally of an elementary character, and from the minute details of their information are rather prolix. They number nearly 90 separate publications, the principal of which are —Traité des arbres et arbustes qui se cultivent en France en pleine terre; Éléments de l'architecture navale; Traité general des pêches maritimes et fluviatiles; Éléments d’agriculture; La physique des arbres; Des semis et plantations des arbres et de leur culture; De Vexploitation des bois; Traité des arbres fruitiers.
