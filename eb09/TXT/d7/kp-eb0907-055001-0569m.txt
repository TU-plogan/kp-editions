DUPONT DE NEMOURS, Pierre Samuel (1739- 1817), a French political economist and statesman, was born at Paris on the 14th December 1739. He studied for the medical profession, but did not enter upon practice, his attention having been early directed to economic questions through his friendship with Quesnay, Turgot, and other leaders of the school known as the Economists. To this school he rendered valuable service by several pamphlets on financial questions, and numerous articles representing and advocating its views in a popular style in the Journal de ΓAgriculture, du Commerce, et des Finances, and the Ephemerides du Citoyen, of which he was successively editor. In 1772 he accepted the office of secretary of the Council of Publip Instruction from Stanislas Poniatowski, king of Poland. Two years later he was recalled to his native country by the advent of his friend Turgot to power. After assisting the minister in his wisely-conceived but unavailing schemes of reform during the brief period of his tenure of office, Dupont shared his dismissal and retired to Gâtinais, in the neighbourhood of Nemours, where he employed himself in agricultural improvements. During his leisure he wrote a translation of Ariosto (1781), and Mémoires sur la vie de Turgot (1782). He was drawn from his retirement by Vergennes, who employed him in preparing, along -with the English commissioner Dr James Hutton, the treaty for the recognition of the independence of the United States (1782), and a treaty of commerce with Great Britain (1786). Under Calonne he was admitted to the Council of State, and appointed commissary-general of commerce. During the Revolution period he advocated reform and constitutional monarchy as against the views of the extreme republicans, and was therefore destined for vengeance when the republicans triumphed. After the 1 Oth August 1792 he was concealed for some weeks in the observatory of the Mazarin College, from which he contrived to escape to the country. During the time that elapsed before he was discovered and arrested he wrote his Philosophie de l’univers. Imprisoned in La Force, he was one of those who had the good fortune toescape the guillotine till the death of Robespierre set them free. As a member of the Council of Five Hundred, Dupont carried out his policy of resistance to the Jacobins, and made himself prominent as a member of the reactionary party. After the republican triumph on the 18 th Fructidor (4th September) 1797 his house was sacked by the mob, and he himself only escaped transportation to Cayenne through the influence of M. J. Chénier. In 1799 he found it advisable for his comfort, if not for his safety, to emigrate with his family to the United States. On his return to France in 1802 he declined to accept any office under Napoleon, and devoted himself almost exclusively to literary pursuits. The consideration accorded to him in the United States was shown by his being employed to arrange the treaty of 1803, by which Louisiana was sold to the Union, and by his being requested by Jefferson to prepare a scheme of national education, which was published in 1812 under the title Sur Veducation nationale dans les États Unis d , Amérique. Though the scheme was not carried out in the United States, several of its features have been adopted in the existing French code. On the downfall of Napoleon in 1814 Dupont became secretary to the Provisional Government, and on the restoration he was made a councillor of state. The return of the emperor in 1815 determined him to quit France, and he spent the close of his life with his two sons, who had established a powder manufactory in the state of Delaware. He died near Wilmington, Delaware, on the 6th August 1817.

Dupont’s most important works, besides those mentioned above, were his De l'origine et des progrès d'une science nouvelle (London and Paris, 1767); Ρhysiocrαiie, ou constitution naturelle du gouvernement le plus avantageux au genre humain (Paris, 1768); and his Observations sur les effets de la liberté du commerce des grains (1760). Dupont was a member of the Institute of France, to which he contributed many papers.
