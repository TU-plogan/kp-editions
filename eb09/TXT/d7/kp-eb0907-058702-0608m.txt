DZUNGARIA, Dsongaria, or Song aria, a formel Mongolian kingdom of Central Asia, raised to its highest pitch by Kaldan or Bushtu Khan in the latter half of the 17th century, but completely destroyed by Chinese invasion about 1757-59. It derived its name from the Dsongars, or Songars, who were so called because they formed the left wing (cfcoπ,left ; gar, hand) of the Mongolian army. Its widest limit included Kashgar, Yarkand, Khotan, the whole region of the Thian Shan Mountains, and in short the greater proportion of that part of Central Asia which extends from 35° to 50° N. lat. and from 72' to 97° E. long. The name, however, is more properly applied only to the present Chinese province of Thian-Shan-pe-lu and the country watered by the Hi. As a political or geographical term it has practically disappeared from the map; but the range of mountains stretching north-east along the southern frontier of the Land of the Seven Streams—as the district to the south-east of the Balkhash Lake is called—preserves the name of the Dzungarian Range.
