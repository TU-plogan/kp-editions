DUNKIRK, or Dunkerque, a strongly fortified seaport town of France, and capital of an arrondissement in the department of Nord, is situated on the Straits of Dover, 40 miles N.W. from Lille, and 194 N. from Paris, in 51° 2' N. lat. and 2° 22' 32" E. long. It is a well-built town, the streets being large, wide, and regular. It is divided into three parts— (1) the town proper, which is the centre of trade; (2) the low town, containing the principal industries; and (3) the citadel, including docks and granaries, and containing the houses of labourers and sailors. Dunkirk is both a naval port and [9:7:544] one of the merchant ports of Paris, and has two harbours, its maritime trade employing about 5000 vessels with a tonnage of 270,000. The docks occupy about 100 acres. It possesses sugar refineries, starch manufactories, distilleries, foundries, and large ship-building yards. The fisheries of the coast are valuable and extensive. The public buildings most worthy of notice are the church of St Eloi, reconstructed about 1560 in the Gothic style, with a Corinthian peristyle built in 1783; the lighthouse, 170 feet high; the Beffroi, 300 feet high, surmounted with signals for vessels in distress, and containing a celebrated peal of bells; the exchange, the second story of which is a gallery for pictures, statuary, medals, and curiosities; and the theatre. The principal square contains the statue of Jean Bart by David of Angers.

Dunkirk is said to have originated in a chapel founded by St Eloi jn the 7th century, round which a small village speedily sprung up. In the 10th century Baldwin III., count of Flanders, raised it to the rank of a town. In 1388 it was burned by the English, and in the 16th century Charles V. built a tower for its defence, of which no traces now remain. In 1558 the English, who had for some time held the town, were expelled from it by the French, who in the ensuing year surrendered it to the Spaniards. In 1646 it once more passed into the hands of the French, who, after a few years’ occupation of it, again restored it to Spain. In 1658 it was retaken by the French and made over to the English. After the Restoration, Charles II., being in money difficulties, sold it to the French king Louis XIV., who fortified it. In 1793 it was attacked by the English under the duke of York, who, however, were compelled to retire from its walls with severe loss. The population in 1872 was 34,342.
