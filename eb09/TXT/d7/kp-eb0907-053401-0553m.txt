DUNDALK, a parliamentary borough, seaport, and market-town of Ireland, county Louth, on the south bank of the Castletown river, near its mouth in Dundalk Bay, 50 miles north of Dublin. It consists of one long street intersected by several shorter ones. The parish church is an old and spacious edifice with a curious wooden steeple covered with copper; and the Roman Catholic chapel is a handsome building in the style of Kingâ€™s College Chapel, Cambridge. The other public buildings that may be noted are the Exchange Buildings (containing the town hall and a free library), the county court house and prison, the union workhouse and infirmary, and the cavalry barracks. There are several educational establishments in the town. The municipal government is in the hands of town commissioners, and the port is under the control of harbour commissioners. The county assizes are held in the town, as well as quarter and petty sessions; and it returns one member to Parliament. A brisk trade, chiefly in agricultural and dairy produce, is carried on, and the town contains some manufactories. Distilling and brewing are the principal industrial works, and there are besides a flax and jute spinning mill, salt works, &c. The port and harbour of Dundalk have recently been undergoing . extensive improvements. The course of the river has been straitened, and the bar and harbour deepened, so that vessels of considerable draught can now come up to the town. In the reign of Edward II. Dundalk was a royal city, and Edward Bruce proclaimed himself king there in 1315. Population in 1851, 9995; and in 1871, 11,377. Area, 1386 acres.
