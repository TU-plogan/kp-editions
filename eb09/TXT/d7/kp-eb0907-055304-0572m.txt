DURAZZO, the ancient Dyrrachium, or Eρidammιs, in Turkish Dratsh, and in Slavonian Durtz, a seaport town of European Turkey, in Albania, about fifty miles south of Scutari, on the eastern shore of the Adriatic. It is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop and a Greek archbishop, but in every respect has greatly declined from its former prosperity. The walls are dilapidated; plantain trees are growing on the gigantic ruins of its old Byzantine citadel; and its harbour, once equally commodious and safe, is gradually becoming silted up. The only features worthy of notice are the quay, with its rows of cannon, and the bridge, 750 feet long, which leads across the marshy stretch along the coast. Such trade as it still possesses is mainly carried on with Trieste, and consists in the export of grain, skins, wool, wood, and leeches. The population is estimated at 9000.
