DUNKERS, or Tunkers, a sect of American Baptists originating in Germany. The name, as its second form indicates, is a nickname meaning dippers, from the German tunken, to dip. From the first the members recognized no other name than “Brethren.” The founder of the sect was Alexander Mack of Schwartzenau, who, along with one or two companions, was led to adopt anti-paedobaptist views about the year 1708. It had scarcely assumed organized existence in Germany when its members were compelled by persecution to take refuge in Holland, from which they emigrated to Pennsylvania in small companies in the years between 1720 and 1729. Their first community was established at Germantown, not far from Philadelphia, and other settlements were gradually formed in New England, Maryland, Virginia, Ohio, and Indiana. In the early history of the sect the sexes dwelt apart, and marriage, while not forbidden, w as discouraged. Similarly, while the holding of private property was not absolutely prohibited, a certain community of goods was established and maintained by the voluntary action of the members, and it was considered unlawful to take interest for money. These features have now disappeared, but in other respects the sect retains much of its original character. Every member has the right to exhort and take part in the religious services, and for a considerable, period no special provision was made for the conduct of worship. There is now, however, a recognized unpaid ministry of bishops and teachers. There are also deacons and deaconesses. In baptism trine immersion is used. The Lord’s Supper is observed in the evening only, and connected with it are the lavipedium, or ceremonial feet washing, and the apostolic “love-feasts.” Putting a literal interpretation on James v. 14, they practise the anointing with oil for the healing of the sick, and many of them will not adopt any other means of recovery. They resemble the Quakers in their plainness of speech and dress, and their refusal to take oaths or to serve in war. Their number, which at one time was estimated at 30,000, has very considerably declined, and the latest account states it at less than 8000. An early offshoot from the general body of Dunkers were the Seventh Day Dunkers, whose distinctive principle, as their name imports, was that the seventh day, and not the first day, of the week was the true Sabbath intended to be perpetually and universally observed. Their founder was Conrad Peysel, one of the first emigrants, who established a settlement at “Ephrata,” about fifty miles from Philadelphia, in 1733. This branch of the sect has almost died out.
