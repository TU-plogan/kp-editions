DROHOBYCZ, a town of Austria, in the Galician circle of Sambor, on the Tysrninika, a right-hand affluent of the Dniester, at the junction of a branch line from Boryslaff with the main Galician railway. It possesses a castle, a beautiful Roman Catholic church, a synagogue, and a German high school; and its inhabitants, who number upwards of 12,000, deal in cattle, grain, earthenware, leather, and salt,â€”the last being obtained from the local brinewells.
