DUTROCHET, René Joachim Henri (1776-1847), a French physiologist and natural philosopher, was born at Château de Néon, Poitou, November 14, 1776, and died at Paris. February 4, 1847. In 1799 he entered the military marine at Rochefort, which, however, he soon deserted to join the Vendean army. In 1802 he began the study of medicine at Paris; and in 1808 he was made physician to Joseph Bonaparte, king of Spain. Appointed chief physician to the hospital at Burgos, he distinguished himself during the prevalence of typhus in that city. He returned in 1809 to France, where he devoted himself to the study of the natural sciences. The number of his scientific publications, which relate to a great variety of topics, is very great. His Recherches sur l ’ accroissement et la reproduction des vegetaux, published in the Mémoires du Museum d'Histoire naturelle for 1821, procured him in that year the French Academy’s prize for experimental physiology. In 1837 appeared his Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire anatomique et physiologique des végétaux et des animaux, a collection of all his biological papers of any importance.
