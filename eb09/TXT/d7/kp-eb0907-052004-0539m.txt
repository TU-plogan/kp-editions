DULUTH, a city and lake port of the United States, in the state of Minnesota, advantageously situated at the south-west extremity of Lake Superior, about 150 miles north-east of St Paul. It forms the eastern terminus of the Northern Pacific railroad and the northern terminus of the Lake Superior and Mississippi railroad. A ship canal, 250 feet wide, which has been cut across Minnesota point, gives ready access to the town from the lake. Duluth stands on the side of an acclivity overlooking the lake. It possesses docks, and contains several manufactories. Owing to its position the rise of the town has been very rapid. In 1860 there were not 75 inhabitants; whereas a census in 1875 showed the population to be 5000. It derives its name from Jean Du Luth, a French officer who visited the spot in the 17th century.
