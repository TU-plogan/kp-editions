DUVERGIER DE HAURANNE, Jean (1581-1643), abbé of St Cyran, a celebrated French theologian, was born at Bayonne in 1581. He studied theology at the university of Louvain, where he formed an intimate friendship with Jansen, who was his fellow student. After quitting Louvain he went to Paris, where his intimacy with Jansen continued, and with him he pursued with great ardour the study of the fathers. Leaving Paris in 1611, they continued the same studies at Bayonne, where Duvergier received the canonry of the cathedral. When Jansen left Bayonne, Duvergier returned again to Paris, and shortly after his arrival there his inflexible and ascetic character secured for him the esteem of the bishop of Poitiers, who gave him a canonry, and in 1620 made him abbé of St Cyran. He established in the monastery the order of St Benoit in all its rigour; but his zeal for reform was so great that it awakened opposition, and he found it expedient to quit his diocese and return to Paris. Here he formed a connection with the influential Arnauld family, and along with Angelique Arnauld, directress of the convent of Port Royal, he completely reformed that institution. His rigorous" asceticism acquiring for him great ascendency over feminine minds, his fame and influence increased with great rapidity, and he soon began to number among his disciples members of the highest classes of society, and to have as his personal friends some of the chief dignitaries of church and state. Soon, however, his enemies came to be as numerous as his friends. His rigid and domineering disposition began to alienate from him many of his disciples; and, taking a leading part in the Jansenist controversy, he excited against himself the peculiar animosity of the Jesuits. At last his views came to be suspected by Richelieu, and he was arrested and thrown into prison at Vincennes, 14th March 1638. No evidence could be obtained from his papers sufficient to criminate him, but to limit his influence he was retained in durance at Vincennes—where, however, he was able to keep up intercourse with his penitents and disciples. On the death of Richelieu he regained his liberty, and resumed his religious duties and his war with the Jesuits with the same energy as before; but he enjoyed only six months of freedom, dying from a stroke of apoplexy, 10th October 1643.
