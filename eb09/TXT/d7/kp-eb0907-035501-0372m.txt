DOMINIS, Marc Antonio de (1566-1624), celebrated as a theologian and natural philosopher, was born in the island of Arbe, in 1566. He was educated in the order of the Jesuits at their college at Loretto, and afterwards studied at the university of Padua. He was employed for some time by the Jesuits as a teacher of rhetoric and mathematics, but he did not join the order. In 1596 he was appointed to the bishopric of Segni, and in 1602 he was raised to the archbishopric of Spalatro. His endeavours to reform the church soon after made him obnoxious to the papal authorities, and he was compelled to leave his native country. Having become acquainted with Bishop Bedell, whilst the latter was chaplain to Sir Henry Wotton, ambassador from James I. at Venice, he communicated to that prelate his treatise De Eepublica Ecclesiastica, which was afterwards (1617, 1620) published at London, with Bedell’s corrections. The main argument of the work was directed against the superiority of the bishop of Rome to other bishops. He came to England with Bedell, where he was received with great respect, and preached and wrote against the Roman Catholic religion. In 1619 he published at London Father Paul's History of the Council of Trent, with a dedication to King James. He was favourably received by the king, who bestowed on him the deanery of Windsor and other ecclesiastical preferments. But on the promotion of Pope Gregory XIV., who had been his schoolfellow and old acquaintance, he was deluded by Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, into the hopes of procuring a cardinal’s hat, and thus of proving an instrument of great reformation within the church. Accordingly he returned to Rome in 1622, recanted his errors, and was at first well received; but he afterwards wrote letters to England recanting his recantation, and, these being intercepted, he was imprisoned by Pope Urban VIII., and died in 1624. There were suspicions that he had been poisoned. Being convicted of heresy after his death, his body was exhumed and burned, and the ashes were thrown into the Tiber. He is believed to have been the first to promulgate a true theory of the rainbow in a tract De radiis visus et lucis in vitris perspectivis et iride (Venice, 1611).
