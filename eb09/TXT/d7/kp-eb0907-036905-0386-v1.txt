DORPAT, in German frequently Dörpt, in Russian Derpt or Yurieff, in Esthonian Tartoma, a city of Russia in Europe, in the government of Livonia, situated on both banks of the Embach, 157 miles north-east of Riga, in 58° 23' N. lat. and 26° 23' E. long. The principal part of the town lies to the south of the river, and the more important buildings are clustered round the two eminences known as the Domberg and the Schlossberg, which, in the Middle Ages, were occupied by the citadel, the cathedral, the episcopal palace, the monastery, and the houses of the wealthier inhabitants. Owing to the great conflagration of 1777, the actual town is almost entirely of modern erection; and its fortifications have been transformed into promenades. Besides one Roman Catholic, three Lutheran, and two Russian churches, a hospital, and an orphanage, a veterinary institute founded in 1846, the economical society of Livonia, an Esthonian learned society, and a medicophysical society, it possesses a famous university, with an observatory, an anatomical theatre, a botanical garden, and a library of about 250,000 volumes, which are housed in a restored portion of the cathedral, burned down in 1596, This university, which renders the town the great intellectual centre of Livonia, preserves the Teutonic traditions of its earlier days, and is much more German than Russian in its culture. It was founded by Gustavus Adolphus in 1632; but i¾ 1699 teachers and students removed to Pernau on the advance of the Russians, and on the occupation of the country by Peter the Great again took flight to Sweden. In spite of the stipulation of the treaty of 1710 and the efforts of the Livonian nobles, it was not till 1802 that its restoration was effected under the patronage of Alexander I.; but since that date its history has been one of considerable prosperity. It possesses 42 ordinary professors, a total teaching staff of 73 members, and upwards of 800 students. The astronomical department is especially famous, owing partly to the labours of Otto Struve, and partly to its possession of Frauenhofer’s great refracting telescope, presented by the emperor Alexander I. The manufacturing industry of the town is very slight, but it carries on a good trade, and has six great markets in the year. Population in 1873, 20,780.

The foundation of Dorpat is ascribed to the grand duke Yaroslaff I., and is dated 1030. In 1223 the town was seized by the Teutonic Knights, and in the following year Bishop Hermann erected a cathedral on the Domberg. From that date till about 1559, the greatest prosperity was achieved under the patronage of the independent episcopal see, and the population reached as high as 50,000. In 1559, the town was captured by the Russians under Peter Ivan Shiuski, but in 1582 it was yielded by treaty to Stephen Bathori of Poland. In 1600, it fell into the hands of the Swedes, in 1603 reverted to the Poles, and in 1625 was seized by Gustavus Adolphus. The Russians again obtained possession in 1666, but once more yielded before the Swedes, and did not effect a permanent occupation till 1703. In 1708 the bulk of the population was removed to the interior of Russia; but before long the town began to receive better treatment from the victors, and when in 1777 it suffered so severely from the conflagration already mentioned, it obtained valuable assistance in the work of restoration from Catherine II.
