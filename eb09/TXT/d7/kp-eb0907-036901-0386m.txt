DOROGOBUSH, a town of Russia in Europe, in the government of Smolensk, about 55 miles E. of the city of that name, on the banks of the Dnieper, in 54° 55' N. ]at. and 33° 17' E. long. It has twelve churches, and still preserves its ancient earthen fortress, with its ramparts and ditch, within the precincts of which are situated the cathedral, the courthouse, and two victualling stores. Its manufactures are of no importance, but it maintains an extensive trade with various parts of Russia, and even with foreign countries, in tallow, leather, and hemp. First mentioned in 1300 as the object of a contest between Alexander of Smolensk and Andrew of Viasma, Dorogobush continued through the 13th century to share in the vicissitudes of the neighbouring principalities, passed in the 15 th successively into the power of the Lithuanians and the Poles, and was finally united with Russia in 1667. It was partially burned by the French on their retreat from Moscow. Population in 1873, 7905- of whom only a very few are Catholics and Jews.
