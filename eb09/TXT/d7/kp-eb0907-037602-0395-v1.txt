DOUGLAS, the commercial capital of the Isle of Man, and a favourite watering-place, stands on a fine semicircular bay on the east coast of the island, at the junction of the Dhoo and Glass, in 54’ 10' N. lat. and 4° 26' W. long. The older streets, as is usual with seaport towns, are irregular and narrow, but the modern ones, on terraces rising beyond the old town, are handsome and spacious. Among the public buildings may be noticed Castle Mona (now converted into a hotel), the “tower of refuge,” on a dangerous rock in the bay, the court-house, the house of industry, the public hospital, and the theatre, which has accommodation for 1000 persons. The ancient parish church of Braddan, partially rebuilt in 1773, has been replaced by a more modern building. There are four chapels and district churches—St Matthew’s, St George’s, St Barnabas’s, and St Thomas’s; and the Roman Catholics, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Congregationalists, and Scotch Presbyterians have also places of worship. The salubrity of the climate, the peculiar characteristics of the surrounding scenery, and the cheapness of living render Douglas a favourite resort. There is communication daily in summer with Liverpool, Fleetwood, and Barrow, twice or thrice weekly with Ireland, and occasionally with Glasgow. The harbour is dry at low water; but vessels drawing not more than 10 feet may enter during neap tides, and those drawing not more than 14 feet during spring tides. A splendid new pier, at which passengers can land and embark at all heights of tide, was erected in 1872, and a spacious promenade, inclosing the greater part of the shore, in 1876. The principal industries are the coasting trade and fisheries. Population in 1871, 13,846.
