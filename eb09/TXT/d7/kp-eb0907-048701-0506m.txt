DRUSUS, MarcusLivius, a patrician of the age of the Gracchi, and a colleague of Caius Gracchus in the tribuneship, 122 b.c. He was a creature of the senatorial party, and was employed by them to outbid the measures of the popular tribune. Gracchus had proposed to found three colonies outside Italy; Drusus provided twelve in Italy. Gracchus had proposed to distribute allotments to the poorer citizens subject to a state rent-charge; Drusus promised them free of all charge. Gracchus had proposed to give the Latins the citizenship; Drusus added immunity from corporal punishment, even in the field. The bait thus offered was swallowed; the people forsook their champion, who fell an easy victim to the hired bravos of Opimius. Drusus was rewarded for his services by the consulship, which he held, 112 b.c. He received Macedonia for his province, where he distinguished himself in a campaign against the Scordisci, whom he drove across the Danube into Dacia, being the first Roman general who reached that river. It is probable that he is the Drusus mentioned by Plutarch as having died in the year of his censorship, 109 b.c.
