DIE(Dea Vocontiorum), the capital of an arrondissement in the department of Drôme, in France, is situated on the right bank of the Drôme, at the foot of Mont Glandaz, in a wide and fertile plain. The manufactures are woollen cloth, paper, leather, and silk; there is some trade in mules, cattle, and wood; and the neighbourhood produces excellent fruit, and the white wine called “Clairette de Die.” The town was formerly the seat of a bishop, and, previous to the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, of a Calvinistic university. The most interesting structures of Die are the old cathedral, with granite columns from an ancient temple of Cybele, and a porch of the 11th century; the episcopal palace, the walls, flanked by towers, and the ruins of a castle—all of considerable age; the triumphal arch on the road towards Gap, known as the Porte St Marcel, portions of an aqueduct, and other Roman remains. In the vicinity are several mineral springs. The population in 1872 was 3876.
