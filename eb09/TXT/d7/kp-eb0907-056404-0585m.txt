DUSSEK, Johann Ludwig (1761-1812), pianist and composer, was born at Czaslau, in Bohemia, on the 9th February 1761. His father, Johann Joseph Dussek, a musician of high reputation, was organist and choir-master in the collegiate church of Czaslau, and several other members of the family were distinguished as organists. He had thus the most favourable opportunity for tho development of the musical talent which he displayed almost from infancy. Under the careful instruction of his father he made such rapid progress that he appeared in public as a pianist at the age of six. A year or two later he was placed as a choir boy at the convent of Iglau, and he obtained his first instruction in counterpoint from Spenar, the choir-master. When his voice broke he entered on a course of general study, first at the Jesuits’ college, and then at the university of Prague, where he took his bachelor’s degree in philosophy. During his curriculum of two and a half years he had paid unremitting attention to the practice and study of his art, and had received farther instruction in composition from a Benedictine monk. In 1779 he was for a short time organist in the church of St Rombaut at Mechlin. At the close of this engagement he proceeded to Holland, where he attained great distinction as a pianist, and was employed by the stadtholder as musical instructor to his family. While at the Hague he published his first works in the form of several sonatas and concertos for the piano. He had already composed at the age of thirteen a solemn mass and several small oratorios, which still exist in manuscript. In 1783 he visted Hamburg, and placed himself under the instruction of Emmanuel Bach. Though he believed himself to have derived great benefit from this, it may be questioned whether his genius was not fettered rather than stimulated by the enthusiastic veneration with which he regarded his model. From Hamburg he proceeded to Berlin, where his powers as a pianist met with their accustomed recognition. After spending two years in Lithuania in the service of Prince Radziwill, he went in 1786 to Paris, where he remained, with the exception of a short period spent at Milan, until the outbreak of the Revolution, enjoying the special patronage of Marie Antoinette and great popularity with the public. Towards the close of 1789 he removed to London, where three years later he married a daughter of Dominico Corri, who was [9:7:565] herself a clever harpist and pianist. In London he obtained his greatest success alike a3 composer, performer, and teacher. Unfortunately, however, he was tempted by the large sale of his numerous compositions to open a musicpublishing warehouse in partnership with Montague Corri, a relative of his wife. The result was injurious to his fame and disastrous to his fortune. Writing solely for the sake of sale, he composed many pieces that were quite unworthy of his genius; and, as he was entirely destitute of business capacity, bankruptcy was inevitable. In 1800 he was obliged to flee to Hamburg to escape the claims of his creditors. Some years later he was attached in the capacity of musician to the household of Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia, with whom he formed an intimate friendship. On the death of his patron in 1806 he passed into the service of Prince Ysenburg as court musician. In 1809 he went to Paris to fill a similar situation in the household of Prince Talleyrand, which he held until his death in March 1812. Dussekhad an important influence on the development of pianoforte music. As a performer he was distinguished by the purity of his tone, the combined power and delicacy of his touch, and the facility of his execution. As a composer he possessed a distinct individuality of style, and, while much that he wrote has little value, his best works rank high among pianoforte classics. His sonatas known as The Invocation, The Farewell, and The Harmonic Elegy, though not equally sustained throughout, contain movements that have scarcely been surpassed for solemnity and beauty of idea. Two operas, which he composed during his residence in London, were failures.
