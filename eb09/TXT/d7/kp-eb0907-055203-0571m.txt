DURANGO, a town of Spain, in the province of Biscay 16 miles south-east of Bilbao, at the confluence of the Durango and the Manaria. As a military position of some importance it is often mentioned in history; its church of San Pedro de Tavira is one of the earliest in the Biscayan district; and that of Santa Ana has some interesting altars constructed by Ventura Rodriguez in 1774. The inhabitants[9:7:553], who number about 2600, are partly engaged in the manufacture of iron and steel, and carry on a trade with Hamburg in chestnuts. The foundation of the town is ascribed to the early kings of Navarre, and in 1153 it obtained the rank of a countship. The decree by which Don Carlos in 1839 ordered all foreigners taken in arms against him to be shot was issued from Durango.
