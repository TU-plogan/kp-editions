DENON, Dominique Vivant, Baron de (1747-1825), artist and archaeologist, was born at Châlon-sur-Saône on the 4th January 1747. His parents sent him to Paris to study law, but he showed from the first a decided preference for art and polite literature, and he soon gave up his professional studies. In his twenty-third year he produced a comedy, Le bon père, which obtained a succès d'estime, its author having already made himself a favourite in society by his agreeable manners and exceptional conversational powers. He brought himself under the notice of Louis XV. with such address as to establish at once his position in court favour. The king intrusted him with the collection and arrangement of a cabinet of medals and antique gems for Madame de Pompadour, and subsequently appointed him attaché to the French embassy at St Petersburg. On the accession of Louis XVI. Denon was transferred to Swéden; but he returned, after a brief interval, to Paris with the ambassador Μ. de Vergennes, who had been appointed foreign minister. In 1775 Deùon was sent on a special mission to Switzerland, and availed himself of the opportunity to visit Voltaire at Ferney. He took a portrait of the philosopher, which was engraved and published on his return to Paris. His next diplomatic appointment was to Naples, where he spent seven years, first as secretary to the embassy and afterwards as charge d’affaires. He devoted this period to a careful study of the monuments of ancient art, collecting many specimens and making drawings of others. He also perfected himself in etching and mezzotinto engraving. The death of his patron, Μ. de Vergennes, in 1787, led to his recall, and the rest of his life was given mainly to artistic pursuits. On his return to Paris he was admitted a member of the Academy of Painting. After a brief interval he returned to Italy, and resided for some years chiefly at Venice. He also visited Florence 'and Bologna, and afterwards went to Switzerland. While there he heard that his property had been confiscated, and his name placed on the list of the proscribed, and with characteristic courage he resolved at once to return to Paris. His situation was critical, but he found support and protection in the friendship of the painter David, who obtained for him a commission to furnish designs for republican costumes. This he did to the satisfaction of the Revolutionists, and his name was removed from the list of emigrants. When the terrors of the Revolution were over, Denon was one of the numerous band of eminent men who found a congenial resort in the house of Madame de Beauharnais. Here he formed the acquaintance of Bonaparte, to whose fortunes he attached himself with the happy instinct of one who was always quick to discern the coming power. On the special invitation of the general he joined the expedition to Egypt, and thus found the opportunity of gathering the materials for his most important literary and artistic work. He accompanied General Desaix to Upper Egypt, and made numerous sketches of the monuments of ancient art, sometimes under the very fire of the enemy. The results were published in his Voyage dans la basse et la haute Egιjpte (2 vols, fol., with 141 plates, Paris, 1802), a work which crowned his reputation both as an archaeologist and as an artist. In 1804 he was appointed by Napoleon to the important office of director-general of museums, which he filled greatly to the benefit of art and artists until the restoration in 1815, when he had to retire. He was a devoted friend of Napoleon, whom he accompanied in his expeditions to Austria, Spain, and Poland, taking sketches with his wonted fearlessness on the various battle-fields, and guiding the conqueror in his choice of spoils of art from the various cities that were pillaged. After his retirement he occupied himself with the preparation of a profusely illustrated history of ancient and modern art, in which he had the co-operation of several skilful engravers. He died at Paris on the 27th April 1825, leaving the work unfinished. It was published posthumously, with an explanatory text by Amaury Duval under the title Monuments des Arts du dessin chez les peuples tant anciens que modernes, recueillis par Vivant Denon (4 vols. fol. Paris, 1829).
