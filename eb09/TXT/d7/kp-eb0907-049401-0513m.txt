DU BARRY GOMARD DE VAUBERNIER, Marie Jeanne, Countess (1746-1793), mistress of Louis XV., was the daughter of Vaubemier, a clerk of the customs at Vaucouleurs, and was born there on the 19 th August 1746. She received little or no education, and, coming to Paris while yet very young, she entered the house of a “marchande de modes.” She soon fell a victim to the temptations which there beset her, and lived as a courtesan under the name of Mdlle. Lange. Her great and peculiar personal charms led Jean Count Du Barry to form the design of receiving her into his house, in order to make it more attractive to the dupes from whom by gambling he won money to furnish him with the means of dissipation. Her success surpassing his expectations, his hopes took a higher flight, and he presented her to Lebel, valet de chambre of Louis XV., with the intention that she should become the mistress of the king. In this she succeeded; but as the favour shown by Louis to a courtesan roused murmurs in the court and remonstrances from his ministers and the members of the royal family, Louis, who was too infatuated to remove her, met their wishes half-way by securing for her a nominal husband. Count Jean Du Barry was married himself, but his brother William offered himself for the ceremony, and after its performance the Countess Du Barry was presented at court on the 22d April 1769. Her influence over the monarch was absolute until his death, and courtiers and ministers were in favour or disgrace with him in exact accordance with her wishes. The Due de Choiseul, who refused to acknowledge her, was disgraced in 1771; and the Due d’Aiguillon, who had the reputation of being her lover, took his place, and in concert with her governed the monarch. The favour of Louis for the Countess Du Barry continued to estrange him from his children and from the most of the royal family, and this isolation induced him to build for her the magnificent mansion of Luciennes. At his death in 1774 an order of his successor banished her to L’Abbaye-du-Pont-aux-Dames, near Meaux, but the queen interceding for her, the king in the following year gave her permission to reside at Luciennes with a pension. Having gone to England in 1792 to endeavour to raise money on her jewels, she was on her return accused before the Revolutionary tribunal of having dissipated the treasures of the state, conspired against the republic, and worn, in London, “mourning for the tyrant.” She was condemned to death December 7, 1793, and beheaded the same evening.
