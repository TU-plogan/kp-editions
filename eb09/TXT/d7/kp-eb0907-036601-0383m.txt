DORIA, Andrea (1466-1560), the famous Genoese admiral, was born at Oneglia in 1466. He belonged to a noble family, several of whose members, both before and after his time, distinguished themselves in the history of Genoa. Having lost both his parents in his youth, he embraced the military profession, and served in the papal guards and under various princes of Italy. It was not until he was fifty years of age that he entered into the service of Francis I. of France, who gave him the command of his fleet in the Mediterranean. In this position he preserved that spirit of independence which is so natural to a sailor and a republican. When the French attempted to render Savona, long the object of jealousy to Genoa, its rival in trade, Doria remonstrated strongly against the measure; this irritated Francis to such a degree that early in 1528 he ordered his admiral Barbesieux to sail for Genoa, then in the hands of the French troops, to arrest Doria, and to seize his galleys. Doria, however, retired with all his galleys to a place of safety, and closing with the offers of the emperor Charles V., returned his commission to Francis, and hoisted the imperial colours. To deliver his country, now weary alike of the French and the imperial yoke, from the dominion of foreigners, was Doria’s highest ambition; and the favourable moment had presented itself. Genoa was afflicted with the pestilence, the French garrison was ill paid and greatly reduced, and the inhabitants were sufficiently disposed to second his views. Before the close of the same year (1528) he sailed to the harbour with thirteen galleys, landed five hundred men, and made himself master of the gates and the palace with very little resistance. The French governor with his feeble garrison retired to the citadel, but was soon forced to capitulate; upon which the people speedily levelled the citadel with the ground. It was now in Doria’s power to have declared himself the sovereign of his country; but, with a magnanimity of which there are few examples, he assembled the people in the court before the palace, disclaimed all pre-eminence, and recommended to them to settle what form of government they chose to establish. The people, animated by his spirit, forgot their factions, and fixed, with his approval, that republican form of government which, with little variation, subsisted until 1815. His disinterested patriotism won for him the appointment of censor for life and the title “Father and Liberator of his Country.” Doria afterwards engaged in an expedition against the Turks, from whom he took Coro∩ and Patras. He also co-operated with Charles V. in the reduction of Tunis and Goulette. In 1547 two successive attempts were made against his life by Fieschi and a Genoese emigrant of the name of Giulio Cibo. He resigned his command in 1556, and died at Genoa in November 1560, being then ninety-four years of age.
