DON, anciently Tanais, a river of European Russia, which ranks immediately after the Volga and the Dnieper. It rises in the Ivan lake, a small basin in the government of Tula, which also sends a portion of its waters to the Volga by means of the Shat, a tributary of the Upa; its course has a general southern direction through the governments of Riasan, Tamboff, Orloff, Voronesh, and the Country of the Don Cossacks; its total length, inclusive of its various windings, is 1325 miles; and its drainage area is calculated at 170,000 square miles. The Ivan lake lying 586 feet above the level of the sea, the average fall in the river is about 5∣ inches to the mile. In the upper division of its course, which may be regarded as extending to th® confluence of the Voronesh, the Don flows for the most part through a low-lying and fertile country, though in the government of Riasan its banks are rocky and steep, and in some places become even precipitous. The strata which it traverses belongs to the Devonian formation. In the middle division, or from the mouth of the Voronesh to the point when it makes its nearest approach to the Volga, it cuts its way to the S.E., for the most part through Cretaceous rocks, which in many places rise on either side in steep and elevated banks, and at intervals encroach on the channel. After passing Kachalinskaya it turns to the S.W., and maintains this direction till it falls into the Sea of Azoff, the first part of this division being still in the Cretaceous formation, but the latter part lying in an Upper Tertiary district. A short distance below the town of Rostoff it breaks up into several channels, of which the largest and most southern retains the name of the river, while the others are known respectively as the Mertvi Donetz, the Mokraya Koloncha, and the Staraya Kuterma. Before it receives the Voronesh, the Don has attained a breadth of from 500 to 700, or even in a few places 1000 feet, while its depth varies from 4 to 20 feet; by the time it has reached its most eastern point, the depth has increased to from 7 to 50 feet, and the ordinary breadth to from 700 to 1000 feet, with an occasional maximum of 14,000 feet; in the lowest division the depth is frequently 7 0 feet, and the breadth in many places 1800 feet. Shallow reaches are not uncommon, and there are at least seven considerable shoals in the south-western part of the course. The river can be used for rafts as far up as the confluence of the Sosna; it becomes navigable after the addition of the Voronesh, and has four regular stations for traffic at Vilkoff, Pavloff, Masloff, and Mamon, in the middle part of its course; but partly owing to obstructions of the channel, and partly to the scarcity of ship-timber in the Voronesh government, it does not attain any great importance as a means of communication till it reaches Kachalinskaya. From that point, or rather from Kalatch where the railway from the Volga has its western terminus, the traffic is very extensive, and is carried on, not only by a variety of small river craft, but also by a regular system of steamboats. Of the tributaries of the river, which are between 30 and 40 in number, the Voronesh, the Khoper, the Medvieditza, and the Donetz are navigable,—the Donetz having a course of 678 miles, and affording during high water a passage to the government of Kharkoff. The lower section of the Don is subject to two annual floods, of which the first, known as the cold water, is caused by the melting of the snow in the country of the Don Cossacks, and the second, or the warm water, is due to the same process taking place in the region drained by the upper parts of the river. About the middle of June (o.s.) the subsidence sets in with great rapidity; in August it is very low water, and navigation almost ceases; but occasionally after the September rains the traffic with small craft is again practicable. During the last hundred years there have been five floods of extraordinary magnitude,—namely, in 1748, 1786, 1805, 1820, and 1845. The river is usually closed by ice from November or December to March or April, and at rare intervals the freezing takes place in October. At Aksai it remains open on the average 250 days in the year, at the mouth of the Medvieditza for 239, and at Novo-Cherkassk for 246.
