D’URFEY, Thomas, more generally known by the familiar name of Tom d’Urfey, an English satirist and song writer, was descended from a family of French Huguenot refugees, and was bom at Exeter. The year of his birth is unknown. He was originally bred to the law, which he forsook for the more congenial employment of writing plays and songs. His humour both in writing and in singing the latter procured him access to the highest circles, and made him a favourite even at court. Addison in the Guardian (No. 67) relates that he remembered more than once to have seen Charles II. leaning on Tom d’Urfey’s shoulder and humming over a song with him. He was a strong Tory and Protestant, and it is said that his songs had considerable influence in strengthening the cause of his party. His dramatic pieces, numbering upwards of thirty, were well received, but were so licentious that none of them kept the stage after the dissolute period for which they were written. D’Urfey, by imprudence and extravagance, became poor as he grew old; and having prevailed on the managers of the playhouse to act his comedy of the Plotting Sisters for his benefit, Addison wrote the above mentioned paper in the Guardian, with another (No. 82) giving a humorous account of his eccentricities, in order to procure him a full house. He died at an advanced age in 1723. His songs, published in 6 vols., under the title of Pills to Purge Melancholy, were reprinted in fac-simile in 1872.
