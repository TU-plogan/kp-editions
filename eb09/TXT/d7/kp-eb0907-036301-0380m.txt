DONGOLA, or DonkolÎ», a town of Egypt, in the district of the same name in the province of Nubia, situated on the left bank of the Nile, about 45 miles above the Third Cataract. It is frequently styled Dongola Makarah, or New Dongola, to distinguish it from Dongola Agusa, or Old Dongola, a now decadent village 75 miles further up the river, which was formerly a flourishing fortified town, but fell into ruins after the devastation of the Mamelukes. Kasr Dongola, or Castle Dongola, and El Ordeh, or The Barracks, are also names in use. The town grew up round the military and administrative buildings established about 1820 by the Egyptian Government; and it is now a thriving commercial centre, with well-furnished bazaars, an indigo factory, and public baths. The barracks were built after a plan by the celebrated German naturalist Ehrenberg. Population about 6000.
