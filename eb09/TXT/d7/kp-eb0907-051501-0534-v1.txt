DUFOUR, Wilhelm Heinrich (1787-1875), a Swiss general, director of the topographical survey of Switzerland, was born at Constance, of Genevese parents temporarily in exile, on the 15th September 1787. During his early studies at Geneva he showed no special capacity, and he took a low place in the entrance examination to the Ecole Polytechnique at Paris, to which he went in 1807. By two years’ close study he so greatly improved his position that he was ranked among the first in the exit examination. Immediately on leaving the school he received a commission in the engineers, and was sent to serve in Corfu, which was blockaded by the English. During the Hundred Days he attained the rank of captain, and was employed in raising fortifications at Grenoble for its defence against the Austrians. After the peace that followed Waterloo he retired from the French army on half-pay, and resumed his status as a Swiss citizen. Refusing the offer of a command at Briançon on condition that he would again adopt the French nationality, he devoted himself to the military service of his native land. From 1819 to 1830 he was chief instructor in the military school of Thoune, which had been founded mainly through his instrumentality. Among other distinguished foreign pupils he had the honour of instructing Prince Louis Napoleon, afterwards emperor of the French. In 1827 he was raised to the rank of colonel, and commanded the Federal army in a series of field manoeuvres. In 1831 he became chief of the staff, and soon afterwards he was appointed quartermaster-general. The most important work of his life was commenced in 1833, when the Diet commissioned him to superintend the execution of a trigonometrical survey of Switzerland. He had already proved his fitness for the task by making a cadastral survey of the canton of Geneva, and publishing a map of the canton in four sheets on the scale of a g⅞o-⅛ . The larger work occupied thirty-two years, and was accomplished with complete success. The map in 25 sheets on the scale of - 10 0 1 0 0 0 was published at intervals between 1842 and 1865, and is an admirable specimen of cartography. In recognition of the ability with which Dufour had carried out his task, the Federal Council in 1868 ordered the highest peak of Monte Rosa to be named Dufour Spitze. In 1847 Dufour received the command of the Federal Army, which was employed in reducing the revolted Catholic cantons to submission. The quickness and thoroughness with which he performed the painful task, and the wise moderation with which he treated his vanquished fellow-countrymen, were acknowledged by a gift of 60,000 francs from the Diet and various honours from different cities and cantons of the confederation. In politics he belonged to the moderate conservative party, and he consequently lost a good deal of his popularity in 1848. In 1864 he presided over the International Conference which framed the so-called Geneva Convention as to the treatment of the wounded in time of war, <fcc. He died on the 14th July 1875. Dufour was the author of a Mémoire sur l'artillerie des anciens et sur celle du moyen-âge (1840), De la fortification permanente (1850), Manuel de tactique pour les officiers de toutes armes (1842), and various other works in military science.
