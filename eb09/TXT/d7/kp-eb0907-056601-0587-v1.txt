DUTENS, Louis (1730-1812), a French writer of some celebrity, was born at Tours, of Protestant parents, January 15, 1730. In his youth he devoted himself to poetry; and in 1748 he composed a tragedy, entitled The Return of Ulysses to Ithaca, which failed in Paris, but was represented with great applause at Orleans. The author, however, soon became sensible of the faults of his work, and abandoned a species of composition in which he found he was not destined to excel. He soon afterwards went to England with an introduction to Pitt, which he had received from a sister of the statesman. His first residence in London was brief, but he soon returned and obtained a situation as tutor in a private family. The father of the pupil was a man of considerable literary and scientific attainments, who instructed him in those branches of knowledge in which he was deficient. In this manner he learnt Greek and mathematics, and studied the Oriental languages, and Italian and Spanish. Soon after the termination of this engagement he was appointed chaplain and secretary to Mr Mackenzie, the English minister at the court of Turin, and left England in October 1758. In 1760, when Mr Mackenzie returned to England, the secretary remained at Turin as chargé d’affaires, until 1762, when he returned to England and attached himself to the family of Lord Bute, who, before retiring from office in 1763, procured him a pension. He again went to Turin as chargé d’affaires; and during this second mission he undertook the task of collecting and publishing a complete edition of the works of Leibnitz (Geneva, 6 vols. 1769) and wrote his work on the Discoveries of the Ancients. On again returning to England he attached himself to the duke of Northumberland, who procured him the living of Elsdon, in Northumberland. He accompanied the duke’s son, Lord Algernon Percy, in his travels through France, Italy, Germany, and Holland; and while at Paris he was chosen a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, in 1775. In the same year he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1776 he returned to England, and soon afterwards accompanied Mr Mackenzie and his wife on a tour to Naples. On his return Dutens was invited by Lord Mountstuart, who had been appointed envoy extraordinary, to accompany him to Turin, and found himself for the third time chargé d’affaires at that court, during a short absence of the envoy. From Turin he went to Florence, and thence to Rome. He was in Paris in 1783, and returned to London the following year. The revenue he derived from his living amounting to .£800 per annum, together with a considerable legacy left him by Mr Mackenzie, and estimated at .£15,000, enabled him to pass the remainder of his life in affluence. He died at London, May 23, 1812.

The principal works of Dutens were his Recherches sur l’origine des Découvertes attribuées aux Modernes (1766, 2 vols. 8vo); Appel au bon, Sons (London, 1777, 8vo), directed in defence of Christi anity against the French philosophers, and published anonymously; Explication de quelques médailles de Peuples, de Villes, et de Rois, Grecques et Phéniciennes (1773, 4to); Explication de quelques médailles du cabinet de Duane (1774, 4to) ; Troisième Dissertation sur quelques médailles Grecques et Pheniciennes (1776, 4to); Logique, ou l'Art de raisonner (1773, 12mo); Des pierres précieuses et des pierres fines, avec les moyens de les connaître et de les évaluer (1776, 12mo); Itinéraire des routes les plus fréquentées, ou Journal dun Voyage aux principales Villes d'Europe (1775, 8vo), .frequently republished ; Considérations Théologiques sur les moyens de réunir toutes les Églises Chrétiennes (1798, 8vo); Oeuvres melées, containing his most important works published up to the date (London, 1797, 4 vols. 4to); L'Ami des étrangers qui voyagent en Angleterre (1789, 8vo); Histoire de ce qui s'est passé pour, le rétablissement d'une régence en Angleterre, (1789, 8vo); Recherches sur le tems le plus reculé de l'usage des Voûtes chez les anciens (1795) ; Mémoires d'un Voyageur qui se repose (Paris, 1786, 3 vols. 8vo). The first two volumes of the last named work contain the life of the author, written in a romantic style; the third bears the title of Dutensiana, and is filled with remarks, anecdotes, and bon-mots.
