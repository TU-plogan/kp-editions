DON COSSACK COUNTRY (in Russian, Donskago Voiska Zemlya, the Land of the Don Army), the south-west portion of European Russia, situated in the basin of the Don, and bounded in part by the Sea of Azoff. Its area, according to the military survey, is 59,650 square miles, or 135,761 square versts, but according to Schweizer 62,574 square miles, or 142,401 square versts. The most of the surface consists of an irregular steppe broken in some places by undulating elevations or conical hills, and traversed by the channels and ravines of the numerous tributaries and sub-tributaries of the principal river. The district to the north is especially flat, forming in fact, as is shown by the characteristics of its flora, a part of the great Aralo-Caspian depression. Cretaceous formations appear throughout the whole “country,” Tertiary and Carboniferous formations especially to the south of the Donetz. Coal and anthracite are found in considerable abundance in several places, and iron ore occurs near the Miuss, the Donetz, and the Khoper. Limestone, chalk, and slate are common; and salt is obtained from various lakes. The upper soil is in general black earth, the subsoil usually clay. Agriculture is still in a backward state owing to the military prejudices of the Cossacks; but the virgin fertility of the ground, and the proximity of such seaports as Taganrog and Rostoff conduce greatly to its development. Wheat is the most generally cultivated cereal, but rye is pretty largely grown in the northern and millet in the southern districts. Flax and hemp have been introduced, and maize is sown in the gardens. Stock-rearing is extensively prosecuted: in 1860 there were about 373,000 horses, 991,000 cattle, and 2,242,000 sheep. The horses show a mixture of various Asiatic strains, those of the southern districts being the best. The cattle are usually of Calmuck or Tatar race, but sometimes of Hungarian or Dutch; and the sheep are, with slight exception, Russian, Calmuck, or Wallachian. The land of the Don Cossacks was divided in 1802 into the following seven districts—Cherkassk, First Don, Second Don, Ust-Medvieditzki or Mouth of the Medvieditza, Khoper, Donetz, and Miuss; and in 1806 a new district, or okrug, was formed of the nomadizing Calmucks. The six first-mentioned are divided into stanitzas i to each of which belongs a definite territory; the Miuss district is occupied by regular landholders; and the Calmucks are arranged according to hundreds, or sotnias. The population in 1858 of the whole Zemlya was 896,870, and in 1867, 1,010,135. Novo-Cherkassk is the seat of government and the residence of the directing ataman of the Don army. In ancient times the Greeks had a colony at Tanais on the Sea of Azoff, and [9:7:357] various factories on the Don; and the Scythians and Sarmatians nomadized throughout the district. Afterwards came the Alans, the Huns, the Ugrians, the Bulgarians, the Avars, and the Khazars, the last even building the small town of Sarkel; then followed the Pechenegs, the Polovians, and finally the Tatars, whose power was gradually diminished during the 16th and 17th centuries by the encroachments of the Russian Cossacks.
