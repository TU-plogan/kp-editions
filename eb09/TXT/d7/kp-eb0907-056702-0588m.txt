DWÂRAKÂ, Dwarka, or Jigat, a town of British India, in Guzerat, near the extremity of the peninsula of Kattywar, in 22° 15' N. lat. and 69° Γ E. long. It is surrounded by a wall, has about 2000 permanent inhabitants, and trades in chalk. As the birthplace and residence of Krishna, it is the most sacred spot in this part of India, and its principal temple is visited annually by many thousand pilgrims. The approach from the sea is by a fine flight of stone steps, and the great pyramid rises to a height of 140 feet. Dwârakâ is of course frequently mentioned in the Mahâbhârata. It was occupied by the British in 1816.
