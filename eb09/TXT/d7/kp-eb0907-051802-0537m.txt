DUHAMEL, Jean Baptiste (1624-1706), a French astronomer and physician, was the son of an advocate, and was born at Vire, in Normandy, in 1624. He commenced his studies at Caen, aud completed them at Paris. At the age of eighteen he wrote a treatise on the Spherics of Theodosius, and added to it a tract on trigonometry, designed as an introduction to astronomy. At the age of twenty-one he became cur√© of Neuilly-sur-Marne, but without neglecting the duties of his calling, he continued to cultivate the physical sciences with zeal. In 1656 he was named almoner of the king; in 1663 he obtained the dignity of chancellor of the church of Bayeux; and in 1666, when Louis XIV. established the Royal Academy of Sciences, he was appointed perpetual secretary. He was preparing a history of the Academy when he died, August 6, 1706. He published numerous works on philosophy, divinity, and physical science.
