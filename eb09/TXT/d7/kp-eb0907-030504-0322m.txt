DMITROFF, a town of Russia, in the government of Moscow, 45 miles due north of the city of that name, in 56 β 2Γ N. lat. and 37° 3Γ E. long., near the river Yakhroma, a sub-tributary of the Volga. Besides the Cathedral of the Assumption and Paraskeue, an ancient building originally erected as a nunnery, it possesses seven churches, a monastery, a hospital, an almshouse, and factories for the manufacture of silk, wool, and cotton. The inhabitants also cultivate market-gardens for Moscow, and carry on a moderate trade in grain. The existence of Dmitroff is due to the grand-duke George Vladimirovitch, who happening, during his exile from Kieff, to receive on the spot the news of the birth of his son Demetrius, celebrated the event by founding the city and assigning it as an apanage for his child. Demetrius continued in possession till he was himself called to the grand-ducal dignity in 1177. In 1304 the town was the seat of a [9:7:306] ducal diet; in 1656 it was visited by a terrible pestilence; and in the Polish-Lithuanian invasion it witnessed the defeat of Sapieha by Prince Ivan Karukin. Population in 1873, 8042.
