DIBDIN, Charles (1745-1814), a well-known writer of songs and musical composer, was born at Southampton on the 15th March 1745, and was the youngest of a family of eighteen. His parents designing him for the church, he w as sent to Winchester; but his love of music early diverted his thoughts from the clerical profession. After receiving some instruction from Kent, the organist of Winchester Cathedral, he went to London at the age of fifteen. In the following year his first work, an operetta entitled The Shepherd’s Artifice, with words and music by himself, was produced at Co vent Garden Theatre. This proved successful, and was followed by other works, his reputation being firmly established by the music to the play of The Padlock, which was produced at Drury Lane under Garrick’s management in 1768, the composer himself taking the part of Mungo. He continued for some years to be connected with Drury Lane, both as composer and as actor, and produced during this period two of his best known works, The Waterman (1774) and The Quaker (1775). A quarrel with Garrick led to the termination of his engagement, and in 1782 he became joint manager of the Royal Circus, afterwards known as the Surrey Theatre. In three years he lost this position owing to a quarrel with his partner. In 1788 he sailed for the East Indies on the invitation of a sailor brother (the “Tom Bowling” of his famous song); but, the vessel having put in to Torbay in stress of weather, he changed his mind and returned to London. A series of mono-dramatic entertainments which he gave at his theatre, Sans Souci, in Leicester Square, brought his songs, music, and recitations more prominently into notice, and permanently established his fame as a lyric poet. It was at these entertainments that he first introduced many of those sea songs which so powerfully influenced the national spirit. The words breathed the simple loyalty and dauntless courage that are the cardinal virtues of the British sailor, and the music was appropriate and naturally melodious. Their effect in stimulating and ennobling the spirit of the navy during the war with France was so marked as to call for special acknowledgment. On retiring from publie life, in 1805, Dibdin was rewarded by Government with a pension of £200 a year, of which he was only for a time deprived under the administration of Lord Grenville. Dibdin died of paralysis in 1814. Besides his Musical Tour through England (1788), his Professional Life,tíu autobiography [9:7:172] published in 1803, a History of the Stage (1795), and several smaller works, he wrote upwards of 1400 songs and about 30 dramatic pieces. He also wrote one or two novels which are now forgotten. An edition of his songs by G. Hogarth (1843) contains a memoir of his life. The edition prepared by his sou Thomas is referred to below
