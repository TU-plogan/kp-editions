DILLEN [Dillenius], Johann Jakob (1687-1747), a distinguished botanist, Was born at Darmstadt. He was educated at the university of Giessen, where he received his doctor’s diploma, but he early turned his attention from medicine to the study of plants. Whilst at Giessen he wrote several botanical papers for the Ephemerides Naturae Curiosorum, and in 1719 he printed there his Catalogus Plantarum sponte circa Gissam nascentium, a little octavo volume illustrated with figures drawn and engraved by his own hand, and containing descriptions of many new genera. In the preface he discusses the classifications of Rivinus, Toumefort, Knaut, and Ray, the last of which was that adopted by him. In 1718 Dillen became acquainted in Germany with the botanist William Sherard, who invited him to come to England. Soon after his arrival there, in 1721, he took up his abode at Oxford, Where Sherard resided. In 1724 he published an enlarged edition of Ray’s Synopsis Stirpùim Britannicarum. In accordance with the will of Sherard, who died in 1728, Dillen was appointed professor of botany at Oxford. He published in 1732, in two volumes folio, with 324 plates executed by himself, the Hortus Elthamensis, of which Linnaeus wrote—“Est opus botanicum quo absolutius mundus non vidit.” That naturalist spent a month with Dillen at Oxford in 1736, and afterwards dedicated to him his Critica Botanica. In 1741 appeared the Historia Muscorum of Dillen, to whom and his contemporary Micheli (1679-1731) cryptogamie botany owes its origin. He died April 2, 1747, in his sixtieth year. A print from his picture at Oxford is to be seen in Sim and König’s Annals of Botany, vol. ii. His books and collection of mosses, with many drawings, were bought by his successor at Oxford, í)r Humphrey Sibthorp, and added to the Sher-ardian Museum.
