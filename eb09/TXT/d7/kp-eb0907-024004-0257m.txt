DILLINGEN, a town of Bavaria, in the circle of Schwaben-Neuburg, on the left bank of the Danube, 24 miles north-west of Augsburg. Its principal structures are the royal palace, formerly the residence of the bishops of Augsburg, the royal gymnasium and Latin school, with a library of 75,000 volumes, five churches, two episcopal seminaries, a Capuchin monastery, a Franciscan nunnery, and a deaf and dumb asylum. The university, founded in 1549, was abolished in 1804, being converted into alyceum. The inhabitants, who in 1875 numbered 5029, are engaged in cattle-rearing, the cultivation of corn, hops, and fruit, ship-building and the shipping trade, and the manufacture of cloth, paper, and cutlery. Dillingen was taken by the Swedes in 1632 and 1648, by the Austrians in 1702, and on the 18th July 1800 by the French.
