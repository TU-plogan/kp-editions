DICTYS CRETENSIS, one of the early historians from whom the later Roman grammarians imagined that Homer derived materials for the Iliad and Odyssey. According to an introduction prefixed by an unknown writer to the Latin translation entitled Dictys Cretensis de Bello Trojano, the author followed Idomeneus, king of Crete, in the Trojan war; and the MS. of his work, written in Phoenician characters, was found in his tomb at Gnossus at the time of the occurrence of an earthquake in the thirteenth year of Neroâ€™s reign, and translated into Greek by order of that prince. A Latin version of the first five books has alone come down to us; but this is generally regarded as a forgery. There is little doubt, however, that there was a Greek original which was probably composed about the time of Nero. The main interest of the -work consists in the fact that, along with that of Dares (q.v.), it was the source from which the Homeric legends were introduced into the romantic literature of the Middle Ages. The editio .princeps dates as far back as 1470. The work is now usually printed along with that of Dares. The best editions are those of Perizonius and Dederich (Bonn, 1837).
