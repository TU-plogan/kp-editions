DONAUWÖRTH, a town of Bavaria, in the circle of Swabia-Neuburg, 25 miles N. of Augsburg, on the left bank of the Danube, at the confluence of the Wörnitz. It is of some importance as a river port, and the centre of a considerable agricultural trade; but its main interest is historical. Having grown up in the course of the 11th and 12th centuries under the protection of the castle of Mangoldstein, it became in the 13th the seat of the duke of Upper Bavaria, who, however, soon withdrew to Munich to escape if possible from the manes of his wife Maria of Brabant, whom he had there beheaded on an unfounded suspicion of infidelity. The town received the freedom of the empire in 1308, and maintained its position in spite of the encroachments of Bavaria till 1607, when the interference of the Protestant inhabitants with the abbot of the Holy Cross called forth an imperial law authorizing the duke of Bavaria to inflict chastisement for the offence. In the Thirty Years’ War which soon after broke out, it was stormed by Gustavus Adolphus in 1632, and captured by King Ferdinand in 1634. In the vicinity the Bavarians and French were defeated by Marlborough and Prince [9:7:361] Louis of Baden in 1704. The imperial freedom restored to the town by Joseph I. in 1705 was again lost by re-inoorporation with Bavaria in 1714. The abbey of the Holy Cross is still standing, and the neighbouring chapel still preserves the sarcophagus of the unfortunate duchess Maria.
