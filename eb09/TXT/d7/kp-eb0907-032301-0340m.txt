DODSLEY, Robert (1703-1761), an eminent bookseller and versatile writer, born in 1703 at Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, where his father is said to have been a schoolmaster. In his youth he was apprenticed to a stocking-weaver, from whom he ran away, taking service as a footman. His first poetical attempts seem to have been made when he was a servant in the family of the Hon. Mrs Lowther, and were published by subscription under the title of The Muse in Livery, or the Footman's Miscellany (1732). This was followed by an elegant little satirical farce called The Toyshop, the hint of which is said to have been taken from Randolph’s Muse's Looking-glass, and which, having obtained the approbation of Pope, was acted at Coven t Garden with great success. The profits accruing from the sale of these two publications enabled him to establish himself as bookseller in Pall-Mall; and his merit and enterprising spirit soon made him one of the foremost publishers of the day. One of the first copyrights he published was that of Johnson’s London, for which he gave ten guineas in 1738, and he was afterwards the leader of the association of booksellers that famished Johnson with funds for the preparation of his English Dictionary. In 1737 a new piece of his own, entitled The King and the Miller of Mansfield, was received with undiminished applause. His immediately subsequent farces, however, were not so popular. In 1738 he published a collection of his dramatic works in one volume 8vo, under the modest title of Trifi.es , which was followed by the Triumph of Peace, a masque, occasioned by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, and a fragment on Public Virtue. Dodsley was also the author of the Economy of Human Life, a work which acquired considerable celebrity; but for this it is supposed he was not a little indebted to the mistaken opinion which long prevailed that it was the production of Lord Chesterfield. The name of Dodsley is from this period associated with much of the literature of his time. Among other things he projected The Annual Register, commenced in 1758, The Museum, The World, and The Preceptor. To these various works Horace Walpole, Akenside, Soame Jenyns, Lord Lyttelton,Lord Chesterfield, Edmund Burke, and others were contributors. His own latest production was a tragedy entitled Cleone, which was received with even greater enthusiasm than his earlier works. It had a long run at Covent Garden; two thousand copies of it were sold on the day of publication, and it passed through four editions within the year. It has long, however, ceased to be read, and apart from his fame as a publisher Dodsley is now chiefly remembered on account of his Select Collections of Old Plays (12 vols. 12mo, London, 1744; 2d edition, 12 vols. 8vo, 1780). He died at Durham while on a visit to a friend, 25th September 1764.
