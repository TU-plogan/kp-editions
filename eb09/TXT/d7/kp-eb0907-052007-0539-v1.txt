DUMARSAIS, César Chesneau (1676-1756), a French philologist, was bom at Marseilles, July 7, 1676. His father died while he was yet an infant; and his mother, [9:7:521] by her extravagance, dissipated his patrimony. He was educated in his native town by the Fathers of the Oratory, into whose congregation he entered; but feeling the restraints on his liberty too severe, he left it at the age of twenty-five, and repaired to Paris, where he married, and was admitted an advocate in 1704. He soon, however, quitted the bar, separated from his wife, to whom he gave up the little he possessed, and went to reside with the President de Maisons, in the capacity of tutor to his son. He was afterwards successively tutor to the son of Law, the projector, and the son of the Marquis de Baufremont. It was during this last period that he published tire results of his grammatical investigations, which were received with great indifference. On terminating his engagement with the Marquis de Baufremont he opened an establishment for education in the faubourg St Victor, which scarcely afforded him the means of subsistence. He strove to eke out his scanty income by contributions to the Encyclopaedia, but his last years were spent in very straitened circumstances. He died at Paris on the 11th June 1756, at the age of eighty. Dumarsais possessed no ordinary talents. His researches are distinguished alike by their accuracy, ingenuity, and depth. As a man, he combined the greatest purity of morals and simplicity of character with a rare degree of manly fortitude in the midst of his misfortunes; yet during the greater part of his life he was left to languish in obscurity, and his merits scarcely attracted any notice until nearly half a century after his death. His works on philosophy and general grammar, however, are worthy of attention. Of these, the best are his Principes de Grammaire and his Histoire des Tropes. D’Alembert and Voltaire both paid a just and discriminating tribute to the merits of Dumarsais. An edition of his works was collected by Duchosal and Millon, and published at Paris in 1797, in seven vols. 8vo. In 1804, the French Institute proposed a prize for an éloye on Dumarsais, which was gained by De Gérando, whose work was published at Paris in 1805, in 8vo. An earlier eloge by D’Alembert is to be found in the Melanges de Littérature, and prefixed to the above-mentioned edition of the works of Dumarsais.
