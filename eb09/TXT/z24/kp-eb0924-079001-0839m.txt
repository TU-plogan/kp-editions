ZITTAU, the centre of the Saxon linen trade and the most populous town in the district of Bautzen, in the kingdom of Saxony, is situated on the left bank of the Mandau, near its confluence with the Neisse, 25 miles south-east of Bautzen and 48 east-south-east of Dresden. The town is built in a regular and modern style. The town-house dates from 1844, and contains a public library of 30,000 volumes. The church of St John was rebuilt in 1834-37; and the church of St Peter and St Paul, with its elegant tower, belonged to an old Franciscan monastery. The latter was restored in 1882 and part of it fitted up as an historical museum. There are five other churches in the town. Zittau is well equipped with schools, including a gymnasium (founded in 1586) and a commercial school, both accommodated in the Johanneum, and several technical institutions. The leading branch of industry is linen and damask weaving; but woollen stuffs, trimmings, &c., are also produced in the factories of the town, and in the surrounding weaving villages, 37 of which, with 70,000 inhabitants, are included in the municipal jurisdiction. The town, which is one of the best endowed in Saxony, also owns valuable forests on the mountains of Upper Lusatia. There are various steam-mills, iron-foundries, brick-fields, and potteries near the town, and extensive deposits of lignite, employing over 1000 hands. Zittau is situated near the border of Bohemia, with which it carries on some trade. In 1885 the population was 23,215, of whom less than one-fifth were Roman Catholics; in 1834 the population was 8508.

Zittau is of Wendish origin (Chytawa is its Wendish name), and was made a town by Ottocar II. of Bohemia. It was one of the six towns of the Lusatian league (1346), at which period it belonged to Bohemia. It suffered severely in the Hussite wars and in the Thirty Years’ War, and was bombarded and burnt by the Austrians in 1757 during the Seven Years’ War. The musical composer Marschner (1795-1861) was born at Zittau.
