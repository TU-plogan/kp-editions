ZEPHYRINUS, St, bishop of Rome from about 202 to 26th August 217, succeeded Victor I. He is described as a man of little intelligence or strength of character, and the somewhat important controversies on doctrine and discipline that marked his pontificate are more appropriately associated with the name of Hippolytus (q.v.) and of Calixtus, his principal adviser and afterwards his successor (see Popedom, vol. xix. p. 489).
