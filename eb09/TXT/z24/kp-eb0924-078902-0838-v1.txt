ZIRCONIUM, a rare element, closely allied to titanium. Klaproth in 1789 analysed zircon and found it to contain a new earth, which he called “zirconia.” Zircon is essentially a silicate of zirconia, ZrO 2 .SiO 2 . For the extraction from it of zirconia the mineral is first of all heated and quenched in water to render it brittle, and then reduced to a fine powder, which is fused up with three to four parts of acid fluoride of potassium at a gentle heat in a platinum crucible. When the mass fuses tranquilly and all the water is expelled, the platinum crucible is placed in a Hessian crucible; the two crucibles are then covered and kept for two hours at the highest temperature producible by means of a wind-furnace. The porcelain-like fuse is powdered, boiled in water, and acidified with hydrofluoric acid, and the residual fluosilicate of potassium is filtered off. The filtrate on cooling deposits crystals of fluozircon-ate of potassium, ZrF 6 K 2 , which are purified by re-crystallization from hot water. The double fluoride is decomposed with hot concentrated sulphuric acid; the mixed sulphate is dissolved in water; and the zirconia is precipitated with ammonia in the cold. The precipitate, being difficult to wash, is (after a preliminary washing) re-dissolved in hydrochloric acid and re-precipitated with ammonia. Hydrated zirconia, Zr(OH) 4 , as thus obtained, is quite appreciably soluble in water and easily in mineral acids, with formation of zirconic salts, e.g., ZrCl 4 , analogous to SnCl 4 . But, if the hydrate is precipitated in the heat, it demands concentrated acids for its solution. The hydrate readily loses its water at a dull red heat and passes into anhydride with vivid incandescence. The anhydrous oxide, ZrO 2 , is with difficulty soluble even in hydrofluoric acid; but a mixture of two parts of concentrated sulphuric acid and one of water dissolves it on continued heating as Zr(SO 4 ) 2 . Zirconia, when heated to whiteness remains unfused, and radiates out abundance of white light. This property has been utilized for the construction of a new kind of gas lamp, in which a colourless flame, produced by the combustion of a mixture of gas and air, serves to heat a hollow cylinder of zirconia suspended over it by means of platinum gauze. Zirconia, like oxide of tin and oxide of titanium, unites not only with acids [9:24:790] but also with basic oxides. For instance, if it be fused up with an excess of carbonate of soda, 2 of CO 2 are expelled by every ZrO 2 , with formation of ortho-zirconate (analogous to ortho-silicate) of soda, ZrO 2 .2Na 2 O. On treating the fuse with water we obtain the salt Na 2 O.8ZrO 2 + 12H 2 O, which crystallizes in hexagonal plates.

Zirconic chloride, ZrCl 4 , is prepared, by igniting a mixture of zirconia and charcoal in a current of chlorine, as a white sublimate. It has the exact vapour-density corresponding to the formula. It dissolves in water with evolution of heat; on evaporation a basic salt, 2ZrOCl 2 + 9H 2 O, separates out in star-shaped aggregates of needles.

Metallic zirconium is obtainable, by heating the double fluoride of zirconium and potassium with metallic potassium, as an iron-grey powder. Troost produced crystallized zirconium by fusing the double fluoride with aluminium in a graphite crucible at the temperature of melting iron, and extracting the aluminium from the fuse with hydrochloric acid. The crystals look like antimony and are brittle; their specific gravity is 4∙15. The powdery metal burns readily in air; the crystalline metal requires to be heated in an oxyhydrogen flame if it is to catch fire. Mineral acids generally attack the crystallized metal very little even in the heat; aqua regia, however, dissolves it readily, and so does hydrofluoric acid. The spark spectrum of zirconium is characterized by five lines, whose wave-lengths are as follows :—6127 in the red, and 4815, 4771, 4738, 4709, and 4686 in the blue. The atomic weight is not known exactly; according to Marignac and Deville, it lies near 90, if O = 16.
