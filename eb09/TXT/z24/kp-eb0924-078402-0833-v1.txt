ZIMMERMANN, Johann Georg, Ritter von (1728- 1795), a Swiss philosophical writer and physician, was born at Brugg, in the canton of Aargau, on 8th December 1728. He studied at Göttingen, where he took the degree of doctor of medicine. Afterwards he practised as a physician in his native place, and here he wrote Ueber die Einsamkeit (1755) and Vom Nationalstolz (1758). These books made a great impression in Germany, and were translated into almost every European language. They are now only of historical interest. In Zimmermann’s character there was a strange combination of sentimentalism, melancholy, and enthusiasm; and it was by the free and eccentric expression of these qualities that he excited the interest of his contemporaries. Another book by him, written at Brugg, Von der Erfahrung in der Arzneiwissenschaft (1764), also attracted much attention. In 1768 he settled at Hanover as private physician of George III. with the title of Hofrath. Catherine II. invited him to the court of St Petersburg, but this invitation he declined. He attended Frederick the Great during that monarch’s last illness, and afterwards issued various books about him, of which the chief were Ueber Frederick den Grossen und meine Unterredung mit ihm kurz vor seinem Tode (1788) and Fragmente über Friedrich den Grossen (1790). These writings display extraordinary personal vanity, and convey a wholly false impression of Frederick’s character. Zimmermann died at Hanover on 7th October 1795.
