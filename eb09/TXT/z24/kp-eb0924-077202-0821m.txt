ZEBULUN (זבולון), one of the twelve tribes of Israel, derived, according to Gen. xxx. 20, from the sixth son of Leah. The verse offers two etymologies of the name, from the roots ZBD, “give,” and ZBL, “inhabit.” The form Zα βoυλωv (LXX.), with d in the last syllable, agrees with the vocalization of the adjective זבול׳י, “Zebuionite.” The country of Zebulun lay in the fertile hilly country to the north of the plain of Jezreel, which forms the first step towards the mountains of Asher and Naphtali, and included the goodly upland plain of Battauf. The description[9:24:773] of its boundaries in Josh. xix. 10 sq. contains few names that can be identified with any certainty: Chislothtabor is apparently the modern Iksâl, a little to the west of Tabor, Daberath the modern Dabûrîya, at the foot of Tabor, Gath-hepher (A.V. Gittah-hepher) the village of Al-Meshhed, and Remmon Rummâna. Thus the eastern boundary laid down in Conder and Kitchener’s reduced Ordnance Survey map comes too near the Lake of Tiberias. The west boundary is not defined in Josh. xix., but should agree with the somewhat vague east boundary of Asher in verse 27. At one period Zebulun must have reached the sea and bordered on Phoenician territory (Gen. xlix. 13, Deut. xxxiii. 18, 19). In the latter passage allusion is made to a feast upon a sacred mountain (Mount Tabor ?) held by Zebulun and Issachar in common, and to the wealth these tribes derived from commerce by sea. Zebulun had a chief part in the war with Sisera (Jud. iv. 6); it furnished one of the judges, Elon the Zebulonite (Jud. xii. 11, 12); and the prophet Jonah, who foretold the victories of Jeroboam II., came from the town of Gath-hepher (2 Kings xiv. 25). The captivity of the northern tribes under Tiglath Pileser (2 Kings xv. 29) appears to have included Zebulun (Isa. ix. 1 [viii. 23]). Nazareth lay within the territory of Zebulun, but is not mentioned in the Old Testament.
