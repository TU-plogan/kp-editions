KNIGHT, Charles (1791-1873), publisher and author, was the son of a bookseller and printer at Windsor, where he was born 15th March 1791. After acquiring some knowledge of Latin and French at a common day school, he was sent at the age of twelve to the classical school of Dr Nicholas of Ealing. There, according to his own account, he imbibed such a tincture of learning as made him desirous to be a scholar; and it was very much in opposition to his wishes that in 1805 he was withdrawn from school to be bound apprentice to his father. In editing The Windsor and Eton Express, commenced by his father in 1812, some gratification was afforded to his literary ambition, and this received additional stimulus when he became the publisher of The Etonian, edited by Praed, with Macaulay, Moultrie, and Derwent and Nelson Coleridge as principal contributors. After editing The Guardian from 1820 to 1822, Knight was induced by the Etonians already mentioned, now undergraduates at Cambridge, to set up in business at Pall-Mall East, and to become for them editor of Knight's Quarterly Magazine. As far as the magazine was concerned the venture was unsuccessful, for it was brought to a close with its sixth number, but it initiated for Knight a literary career as publisher and author which extended over forty years, and the unselfish enterprise of which conferred lasting intellectual benefit on the gener,al mass of his fellow countrymen. In 1827 Knight became the superintendent of the publications of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, for whom he projected and edited The British Almanac and Companion, commenced in 1828. In 1829 he began the publication of The Library of Entertaining Knowledge, he himself writing several volumes of the series. 1832 aud 1833 saw respectively the commencement of The Penny Magazine and The Penny Cyclopedia, two literary ventures which so far as circulation was concerned were highly satisfactory in their results, but the latter of which, on account of the heavy excise duty, was completed at a great pecuniary sacrifice. Besides a considerable number of illustrated editions of other standard works, Knight completed in 1842 The Pictorial Shakespeare, which, although now superseded in regard to critical scholarship, is still valued for the research and taste displayed in its illustrations. The Pictorial Shakespeare was followed by various other editions of the same author. The energy of Knight also found scope in the compilation of a variety of illustrated series, such as Old England and The Land We Live in. In 1853 he became editor of The English Cyclopedia, and conjointly with the multifarious duties of suβh an office he was also engaged in writing his Popular History of England, published in eight volumes, 1854-61. In 1864 he withdrew from the business of publisher, but he continued his active literary career nearly to the close of his long life, publishing The Shadows of the Old Booksellers (1865), an autobiography under the title Passages of a Working Life During Half a Century (3 vols., 1864-65), an historical novel Begfd at Court (1868) and subsequently various papers in The British Almanac and Companion. He died at Addlestone, Surrey, March 9,1873.
