KASTAMUNI, sometimes Costambone, the chief town of a Turkish vilayet of the same name in Asia Minor, is situated on the Gök Irmak, about 250 miles east of Constantinople. It is the seat of a commercial court, consisting of two Mohammedan and two Christian members. The mosques are said to number thirty-six, and there are four dervish monasteries. Situated as it is in the Angora goat district, Kastamuni has a large trade in goat’s hair (about 980,000 ft> annually), and carries on the manufacture of mohair cloth. Copper is obtained in the neighbourhood, and the copper wares of Kastamuni are well-known in Asia Minor. Coal was for a time worked close to the town, but, the people objecting, it is said, to the smoke, the governor closed the mines. The population is estimated at .40,000. Kastamuni is the Castamon frequently mentioned by the Byzantine historians.
