KIMHI. ReDaK, i.e., Rabbi David Kimhi or Kimchi,^[1. Not Karachi. Compare Π'ΠO'p in the Talmud Yerushalmi, Hοrαyοth, iii. 2.] was born at Narbonne after 1155, and died probably in the same city about 1235. His father Rabbi Yoseph, or his grandfather Rabbi Isaac (Yishak) Ibn Kimhi, had immigrated into Provence from Spain, where Arab fanaticism had compelled the Jews to flee from the sword of tyranny. In Provence the family took the Gentile surname of Petit ^[2. From these circumstances Kimhi is known as Hassepharan (the Spaniard), as Ibn Kimhi, or as Maistre Petit. Petit is, to a certain extent, an equivalent of Kimhi (from ΠOp, grain ground small).] e Rabbi David lost his father (who was himself a grammarian, Bible commentator, and poet of no mean order) very early; but his elder and only brother, Rabbi Mosheh (a fair scholar, but famous chiefly through his younger brother), was his principal oral teacher. The valuable literary treasures of his father, however, falling into his hands, Redak grew strong by studying them, and, as we know, eclipsed them completely, although he lacked his father’s originality. But, if Rabbi David lacked originality, he had abundance of instinct for finding out the best in the works of his predecessors, and abundance of genius for digesting and assimilating it till it became his own in a peculiar way. Although preceded by Hayyùj, Ibn Janâh, and others, and succeeded by Abraham de Balmes, Elias Levita, and others, Kimhi has maintained the position of the greatest Jewish grammarian and lexicographer for six hundred and fifty years. And, although much inferior as a Biblical scholar and talmudist to Rashi, and as a critic and philosopher to Abraham Ibn Ezra, he has outstripped both in the eyes, not only of the Christians, but to some extent even of the Jews, and thus reigned supreme for more than half a millennium, as a commentator on the Bible. The fact is, he united in his own person the childlike simplicity of Rashi and the incisive criticism of Ibn Ezra. Add to this that he was master of the Targums and Aggadoth as few before or after him, that he had Hebrew, Arabic, and Greek philosophy at his fingers’ ends, and that he was endowed with a truly poetical soul, and the mystery is explained how the merely reproductive scholar could cause original scholars of the highest eminence, but who were one-sided, to be all but forgotten. Not only have his works, in whatever field they are to be found, been printed and reprinted, but the most important of them are translated [9:14:78] into Latin, 1 into Judaeo-German, 2 and even into English. 3 The following is a list of Kimhi’s works, which, however, lays no claim to perfection :—
