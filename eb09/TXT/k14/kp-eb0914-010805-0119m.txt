KLOPSTOCK, Friedrich Gottlieb (1724-1803), German poet, was born at Quedlinburg on the 2d of July 1724. He was educated partly at the gymnasium of his native town, partly at Schulpforta. After studying theology for a short time at Jena, he went in 1746 to the university of Leipsic, where he made the acquaintance of Cramer, Schlegel, Rabener, and other young men of letters, who were conducting the Bremische Beiträge. At Schulpforta Klopstock had become conscious of a talent for poetry, and had resolved to write a great epic. His original intention was to make Henry the Fowler his hero, but this was soon abandoned in favour of the scheme to which he devoted the best years of his life. The first three cantos of The Messiah, which were planned in prose in Jena, he finished in Leipsic; and they were published anonymously in the Bremische Beiträge in 1748. The name of the author was soon known, and Klopstock suddenly found himself the most popular poet of his generation. In 1748 he accepted the position of tutor to a private family in Langensalza, and in 1750 he went to Zürich, whither he was invited by Bodmer, the translator of Paradise Lost, who had been deeply impressed by the early cantos of The [9:14:109] Messiah. In Zürich Klopstock received from Frederick V. of Denmark, on the recommendation of his minister Count Bernstorff, an invitation to settle in Copenhagen with a pension of 400 thalers. The invitation was accepted; and on his way to the Danish capital he met at Hamburg the lady who, in 1754, became his wife—Margarethe (Meta) Moller, an enthusiastic admirer of his poetry. She died in 1758; and after her death Klopstock edited her writings, which give evidence of a tender, sensitive, and deeply religious spirit. In 1771 Klopstock left Copenhagen, and followed his friend Count Bernstorff to Hamburg, where, in 1773, he issued the last five cantos of The Messiah. After spending about a year at the court of the margrave of Baden in Carlsruhe, he returned to Hamburg with the title of hofrath and a pension, which he retained along with the pension of the king of Denmark. During the rest of his life he remained in Hamburg, where in 1792 he married Johanna Elizabeth von Winthem, a widow who had been for many years one of his most intimate friends. He died on the 14th of March 1803, and was buried beside his first wife in the village of Ottensen, near Hamburg. Besides The Messiah he wrote many odes; and in several dramas he celebrated the deeds of the ancient German hero, Arminius, while in others he dealt with the earliest narratives of the Old Testament. He was also the author of Fragmente über Sprache und Dichtkunst, Grammatische Gespräche, and a book entitled Gelehrtenrepublik. In these works he made important contributions to philology and to the history of German poetry. Klopstock’s dramatic writings are without value: many of his odes, especially those on subjects taken from northern mythology, are so vague as to be hardly intelligible; and The Messiah lacks plastic force, unity of conception, and precision of style. His best odes, however, and many passages of The Messiah are still admitted to be marked by lyrical genius of a high order; and all German critics recognize that he exercised a salutary influence on the literature of his age by helping to deliver it from slavish adherence to foreign models.

An edition of his works in 12 octavo volumes was published in Leipsic, 1798-1817; and among later editions may be mentioned one in 12 volumes, 1823-26, another in 9 vols., 1839, and a third in 11 vols., 1844-45. Klopstock’s writings are included in Hempel’s Nationalbibliothek, and there is a new edition, with notes, by Bock (Stuttgart, 1876). See K. F. Cramer, Klopstock, er und uber ihn ; and Klopstock’s Jugendgeschichte in the Kleine Schriften of D. F. Strauss.
