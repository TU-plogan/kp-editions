KEMBLE, Charles (1775-1854), a younger brother of John Philip Kemble noticed below, was born at Brecknock, South Wales, 25th November 1775. Like his brother be was educated at Douai. After returning to England in 1792, he obtained a situation in the post-office, but this he soon resigned for the stage, making his debut at Sheffield as Orlando in As You Like It. During the early period of his career as an actor, chiefly on account of the great abilities of his sister and brother, he made his way only slowly to public favour. For a considerable time he played along with them, chiefly in secondary parts, and this with a grace and finish which received scant justice from the critics. Ultimately he won independent fame, especially in com√©die larmoyante. His gifts had been disciplined to the utmost degree of perfection of which they were capable, by his liberal mental culture and by refined social intercourse; and such characters as Archer, Doricourt, Charles Surface, and Ranger he played with an airy grace and polished humour that have never been excelled; while he had sufficient fire and energy to give adequate effect to romantic passion and pathos. In genteel comedy he was ably supported by his wife Miss De Camp, whom he married in 1806. His imposing person, classical countenance, and tuneful voice also enabled him to be highly successful in historical drama, some of his principal parts being Alcibiades, Antony, Henry V., and Orestes. The latter period of his career was clouded by money embarrassments in connexion with his joint proprietorship in Covent Garden Theatre. He formally retired from the stage in December 1836, but his final appearance was on April 10, 1840. For some time he held the office of examiner of plays. He died November 12, 1854.

See Gentleman's Magazine, January 1855; and Records of a Girlhood, by his daughter Frances Ann Kemble, who has achieved distinction both as a tragedienne and an authoress.
