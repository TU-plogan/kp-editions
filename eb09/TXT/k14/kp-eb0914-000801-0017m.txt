KÂSHÎ, the name given to the glazed and coloured ornamentation of Mohammedan buildings in parts of Persia and India, and to the art of making it. The work is of [9:14:9] two kinds—on clay (bricks or tiles), and on cakes of lime mortar. For surfaces of one colour, domes, &c., both kinds are used, differing only in the shape of the tiles or mortar-cakes. Figured patterns are differently treated with the different materials. On clay tiles, the designs with their several colours are laid on by stencilling, and the tile then glazed. Designs in coloured mortar work have each separate piece of colour on a separate cake of hardened mortar, cut to the required shape; and these, glazed separately, are afterwards cemented together on the walls of the building, or first made up into complete panels, which are then set in their place on the walls. The designs are commonly foliage and flowers, or geometrical figures and interlacing arabesques, and inscriptions in Arabic and Persian characters, and are, many of them, very beautiful.

The colours chiefly used are blue, green, yellow, purple, brown, and white. A tile is first painted over with a very fine clay paste, to make a smooth surface on which to apply the colour; and similarly the little mortar cakes are first painted, on the side to be coloured, -with a thin liquid glass. It is perhaps owing to defect in this part of the process, or to imperfect burning, that the tile figured work on some old buildings, particularly on the south side, has flaked off. The glazed work on mortar, and on tiles of one colour, is generally more permanent.

The best specimens of kâshi work in India are at Tatta and Hyderabad in Sind, and at Multân and Lahore in the Punjab. There are also buildings thus ornamented, chiefly of the time of Akbar and Jahangir (16th and 17th centuries), at Delhi, Agra, Gwalior, and some other places, but the best and most numerous are in the western provinces above named, particularly at Lahore and at Tatta. The buildings at Lahore having the finest figured kâshi work are the mosque of Wazir Khan, the gateways of certain old pleasure gardens, and the Gola Sarai. There is a tomb at the same place (the tomb of Abd’ ur Razzâk) built in the early part of the 16th century, which bears the name of the blue dome, its covering being of clay bricks coloured blue on the narrow exposed face. Another, built about fifty years later (the tomb of Shah Mιisa), is known as the green dome. It is covered with little mortar blocks, in shape half cylinders, coloured and glazed on the flat face, and with two deep nicks on the rounded back to give a hold on the plaster in which they are set. A celebrated tomb at Meshhed in northern Persia bears the same name, and likewise another at Kirman; the domes of these buildings, however, though called green, are in reality blue. At Tatta the kâshi work is all on clay tiles; there is no inlaid work of coloured mortar. The finest of the buildings at Tatta, a mosque built by Shah Jahân, has lately had the defective parts of the figurcd tile-work restored.

The art is now carried on at Tatta, at Hala, a village 30 miles north of Hyderabad, and at a few other places.
