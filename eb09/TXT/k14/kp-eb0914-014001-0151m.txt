KOPREINITZ, an ancient royal free town of Hungary, in the province of Croatia and Slavonia and county of Körös, is situated about 16 miles north-east of the county town Körös (Kreutz), and on the Zâkâny-Zâgrâb line of the Hungarian state railway, in 46° 13' N. lat., 16° 50' E. long. The most interesting building is the old castle or fort, still in a good state of preservation, and now used as barracks. There are also in the town Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches, a Jewish synagogue, a town-hall, and a municipal savings bank, besides the usual Government offices. Both the weekly and occasional fairs are well attended, but the trade is chiefly confined to the agricultural products of the neighbourhood. The communal lands, extending principally over a level plain, yield large quantities of grapes, fruit, beans, timber, and grain, especially maize. Population in 1880, 6049.
