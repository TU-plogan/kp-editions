KHONSAR, a town in the province of Irak-Adj emi, Persia, 92 miles north-west of Ispahan on the Hamadan route, in a gorge of the hills, which here approach so close that all the intervening space is occupied by the houses and their garden plots. The town straggles some 6 miles along the gorge, with a mean breadth of scarcely half a mile. There is good water from the hills, and a great profusion of fruits, the apples yielding a kind of cider, which does not keep. The climate is cool in summer but excessively cold in winter. Population 2500 families, or about 12,500 souls.
