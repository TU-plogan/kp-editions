KRAJOVA, or Crajova, a town in the circle of Dolschi, Roumania, is situated near the Schyl, a tributary of the Danube, about 110 miles west of Bucharest. There are prosperous salt-works situated in the town; and from its position at the junction of the Carpathian high-roads with the route from Bucharest to Widdin its trade (largely in the hands of Jews) is important. In 1873 its population was 22,764.

Krajova was the former capital of Little Wallachia. In 1397 it was the scene of a victory of the waiwode Marcea over the Turkish sultan Bajazet; and there, in October 1853, a fight between the Russians and Turks took place.
