KEITH, au old Scotch family which takes its name from the barony of Keith in East Lothian, bestowed, it is said, by Malcolm II. on a member of the house along with the office of hereditary grand marischal in reward of bravery shown in a battle against the Danes. The importance of the family was increased by a grant in 1320 of part of the forfeited estates of the earl of Buchan to Sir Robert Keith for his valour in support of the cause of Robert the Bruce, and by the inheritance in the next century of the lands of the Frasers of Kincardineshire through the marriage of Sir William Keith, who in 1458 was created Lord Keith and Earl Marischal of Scotland. William, earl marischal, great grandson of the first of the line, distinguished himself at the battle of Pinkie in 1547, and was a member of the council of the kingdom during the minority of Queen Mary. By his marriage with his cousin Margaret, daughter of Sir "William Keith of Inverugie, he nearly doubled his estates, but, becoming involved in money embarrassments, he lived for some time in seclusion in his castle of Dunnottar, obtaining on that account the sobriquet of “William that kept the tower.” He was succeeded in 1581 by his grandson George, fifth earl, who, besides having studied under the direction of Beza at Geneva, had acquired a comprehensive knowledge of the politics and customs of most of the courts of Europe. Probably for this reason he was chosen by King James to negotiate his marriage with Queen Anne of Denmark and bring her to Scotland. Throughout life he showed a keen interest in the advancement of learning. He was one of the commissioners appointed in 1582 to inquire into the management of King’s College, Aberdeen, and out of his own private fortune he founded and endowed Marischal College in that city, which received a charter in 1593 He died at Dunnottar, April 5, 1623. The estates of the Keiths were forfeited on account of the part taken by George Keith, tenth earl, and his brother Francis (see next article) in the rebellion of 1715. Through the influence of his brother with Frederick the Great, the earl became governor of Neufchatel. After the reversal of the attainder he returned to Scotland, but soon made his way back to Berlin, where he died in April 1788. Through his death without issue the male line of the house became extinct. From the female line descended the Keith Elphinstones, one of whom, Sir George, was on account of his brilliant naval services created an Irish peer with the title of Baron Keith of Stonehaven Marischal. Sir John Keith, third son of the sixth earl marischal, was created Earl Kintore and Lord Keith of Inverurie and Keith Hall, on account of the part he was supposed to have taken in saving the regalia of Scotland when Dunnottar Castle, where they were deposited, was besieged by Cromwell.
