KÖNIGGRÁTZ (Bohemian, Krâlové Hradec) i a fortified town and episcopal seat in Bohemia, at the confluence of the Adler with the upper Elbe, and at the junction of the Reichenberg-Pardubitz and North-Western lines of railway, in 50° 10' N. lat., 15° 49' E. long. Wax candles, gloves, shoes, woollen cloths, and musical (wind) instruments are manufactured. The population in 1880 was 6173. The place is chiefly notable from the battle of Königgrätz or Sadowa fought in its neighbourhood on 3d July 1866, when the defeat of the Austrians under Benedek decided the German supremacy of Prussia, and led to the acquisition of Venice by Italy and the constitutional independence of Hungary. See Jähns, Die Schlacht bei K'oniggratz t 1876.
