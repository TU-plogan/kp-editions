KERKÚK, or Kerkook, a town of Asiatic Turkey, in the vilayet of Baghdad, is situated on the right bank of the Khasa Tshai, about 140 miles north of the city of Baghdad. A suburb, Mahalle, on the left bank of the stream, which is spanned by a bridge, contains the residence of the pasha. The citadel stands east of the river upon an artificial mound, 130 feet high, which in Niebuhr’s time was still surrounded by an earthen rampart. The citadel hill is the residence of the old Nestorians, now adherents of the Church of Rome. Round the foot of this hill run the dirty, crooked, and narrow streets of the lower town, with their flat-roofed, ugly houses, built partly of wood and partly of stone. The only large building is occupied by the bazaar, with passages one hundred paces long. Owing to its position at the junction of several routes, Kerkùk has a brisk transit trade in hides, Persian silks and cottons, colouring materials, fruit, and timber, on the way from Suleiιnanieh to the north. The natural warm springs at Kerkùk are used to supply baths. The surrounding country is fertile and well-cultivated; the petroleum and naphtha springs near the town are its most valuable commercial resource. Till lately the petroleum was used as fuel by the Turkish steamers on the Tigris; but English coal has now superseded it. The official designation of Kerkùk is Shahr Zul. The inhabitants, from twelve to fifteen thousand in number, are chiefly Mohammedan Kurds; there is a Jewish quarter beneath the citadel. The reputed sarcophagi of Daniel and the Hebrew children are shown in one of the mosques.

Kerkùk is the ancient metropolitan city Karkâ a’ Beth Slôk (“fortress of the house of Seleucia ”).
