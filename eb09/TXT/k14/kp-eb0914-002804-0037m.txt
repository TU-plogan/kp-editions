KEJ, the capital of the province of Mekran (the Gedrosia of the Greeks) in Baluchistan, is situated in 26° N. lat. and 62° 50' E. long. There exists really no town, but a number of small villages dominated by a fort built upon a rock, on the eastern bank of the Kej river. This fort, like many others similarly placed throughout the country, is supposed to be impregnable, but is in fact of no strength except against the matchlocks of the surrounding tribes.

Kej in former days was considered of very great importance by the rulers of Khelat, who have at various times marched large armies into the province with a view to maintaining their supremacy. At the commencement of the present century it had the reputation of being a town of considerable commercial importance, trading through Panjgur with Kandahar, with Kurrachee via Beyla, and with Muscat and the Persian Gulf by the seaport of Guader, distant about 80 miles. The present ruler of Khelat is able to exert but a feeble sway over this portion of his dominion, although he appoints a governor to the province. The principal tribe residing around Kej is that of the Gitchki, who claim to be of Rajput origin, and to have settled in Mekran during the 17th century, having been driven out of ,Rajputana. There are numerous other tribes having very curious traditions as to the time and manner of their settling in the country. The climate during summer is almost unbearable for Europeans. During winter, however, it is temperate. The principal exports consist of dates, which are considered of the finest quality. There is little chance of Kej resuming its former prosperity.
