KUSTENDJE, or Küstendjie, a seaport of Rournania on the coast of the Black Sea, 140 miles east of Bucharest, the terminus of the railway from Tchernavoda on the Danube, and the principal outlet for the produce of the Dobrudja. The harbour is well defended from the north winds, but those from the south, south-east, and southwest prove sometimes highly dangerous. Of the exports (valued at £217,828 in 1880) the chief are cereals, wool, skins, and cattle. Since the incorporation of the Dobrudja with Rournania in 1878 Kustendje gives its name to a province.

Kustendje is the Constantiana which was founded in honour of Constantia, sister of Constantine the Great. It lies at the seaward end of the Great Wall of Trajan, and has evidently been surrounded by fortifications of its own. In spite of damage done by railway contractors (see Henry C. Barkley, Between the Danube and the Black Sea, 1876) there are considerable remains of ancient masonry—walls, pillars, &c. A number of inscriptions have been found in the town and its vicinity which show that Tomi, the place of Ovid’s banishment, must have been only a little way off.

In regard to the Kustendje inscriptions in general, see Allai d, La Bulgarie Orientale, Paris, 1866; Desjardins in Ann. dell' istit. di corr. arch., 1868; Corpus inscript, lat., vol. iii.; and a paper on Weickum’s collection in Sitzungsbericht of the Munich Academy, 1875.
