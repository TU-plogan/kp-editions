KORAT, a small territory, tributary to Siam, is situated ta the north-east of Bangkok, on the borders of Siam and Cambodia. The approach to it from Bangkok is through an extensive mιlarious forest, called by the natives, on account of its fatal character, Dong Phya Phai, the forest of the king of fire. The chief mountain is named Khasjai, and from it flows the river Mahot. The productions and exports from Korat comprise stags’ and panthers’ skins, raw silk, manufactured silk and cotton, peacocks’ tails, ivory, elephants’ bones, and a small quantity of sugar. The copper-mines of Korat are said to be rich; silk of rather inferior quality is brought from Laos, Ubone, and Bassac. Elephants, buffaloes, and oxen are abundant in the province. Korat is governed by a ruler who has absolute power of life and death. It pays a tribute of gold, silver, and silk to Siam, and has to furnish a large levy of men when required. Sir John Bowring estimates the population of the whole district at 60,000. Korat, the chief town, lies about 170 miles north-east of Bangkok. It is surrounded by a wall, and stands on a stream whose banks are bordered with little plantations of betel and cocoa-nut trees. Outside the town proper is the Chinese quarter, consisting of sixty or seventy houses surrounded by a strong palisade 9 feet high. The Chinese number about 600, and are the industrious trading element in the population. The native name of Korat is Nakhon Raxa Semi, or frontier town. The population is 5000 or 6000.
