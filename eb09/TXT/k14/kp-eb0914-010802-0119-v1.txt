KLÉBER, Jean Baptiste (1753-1800), was born at Strasburg in 1753 or 1754, where his father was a builder. He was meant to be an architect, but his opportune assistance to two German nobles in a tavern brawl obtained for him a nomination to the military school of Munich. He soon obtained a commission, but resigned it in 1783 on finding his humble birth in the way of his promotion. On returning to France he was appointed inspector of public buildings at Belfort, where he studied fortification and military science. In 1792 he enlisted in the Haut-Rhin volunteers, and was from his military knowledge at once elected adjutant. At the siege of Mainz under Merlin de Thionville, he so distinguished himself that he was made general of brigade in July 1793. In that capacity he commanded in the Vendean war, and was instrumental in winning the victories of Torfou, Chollet, Le Mans, and Savenay. For openly expressing his opinion that lenient measures ought to be pursued towards the Vendeans he was recalled; but in April 1794 he was made general of division, and sent to the army of the North. Under Jourdan he commanded the left wing at Fleurus, June 26, 1794, and Aldenhaven, October 2, and took Maestricht after a short siege on November 8. During the winter of 1794-95 he besieged Mainz, and on June 4, 1796, gained the victory of Altenkirchen over the prince of Würtemberg. Kléber now considered he had a fair claim to a command in chief, and, not receiving one in the spring of 1797, he resigned his division in disgust, and retired to Paris. There he allied himself with the reactionary party, and, according to Mathieu Dumas even offered to command any forces that could be raised against the coup d’état of Fructidor 1797, but there were no forces to command. He gladly accepted a division in the expedition to Egypt under Bonaparte, but was wounded in the head at Alexandria in the very first engagement, which prevented his taking any further part in the campaign of the Pyramids, and caused him to be appointed governor of Alexandria. In the Syrian campaign of 1799, however, he commanded the vanguard, took El-Arish, Gaza, and Jaffa, and bore the brunt of the battle of Mount Tabor, April 15, 1799. Being left by Bonaparte in command of the army in Egypt, he made the convention of El-Arish, and, when Lord Keith refused to ratify the terms, attacked the Turks at Heliopolis, though with but 10,000 men against 60,000, and utterly defeated them on March 20, 1800. He then retook Cairo, which had revolted from the French, and was assassinated there by a fanatic on June 14, 1800, the very day on which Desaix fell at Marengo. Kléber was undoubtedly one of the greatest generals of the French revolutionary epoch, but hardly had a chance of showing his powers against a capable adversary; Napoleon’s ejaculation on hearing of his death was “Eh bien; a rival the less.”

Ernouf, the grandson of Jourdan’s chief of the staff, published in 1867 a valuable biography of Kleber. See also Keynaud’s Life cf Merlin de Thionville,Sefs Memoirs, Dumas’s Souvenirs, Napoleon’s Memoirs, dictated at St Helena, and Martha-Becker’s Desaix.
