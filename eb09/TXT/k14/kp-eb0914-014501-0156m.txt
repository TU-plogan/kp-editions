KOTZEBUE, Otto von (1787-1846), Russian navigator, sou of the subject of last notice, was born at Revel on December 19, 1787. After being educated at the St Petersburg school of cadets, he accompanied Krusenstern on his voyage of 1803-6. After his promotion to lieutenant, Kotzebue was placed in command of an expedition fitted out at the expense of the imperial chancellor, Count Rumantsoff, in the brig Rurick. In this vessel, with only twenty-seven men, Kotzebue set out on July 30, 1815, to find a passage across the Arctic Ocean, and explore the less known parts of Oceania. Proceeding by Cape Horn, he reached on April 16, 1816, Schouten and Lemaire’s Isle of Dogs. After cruising about the Pacific for some time, and discovering various islands and groups,—as the Krusenstern group, and the Kutusoff and Suwaroff Islands in the east of the Caroline archipelago, —Kotzebue made for Kamchatka, and on June 29 reached New Archangel. In the middle of July he proceeded northwards, coasting along the north-west coast of America, discovering and naming Kotzebue Gulf or Sound and Krusenstern Cape. Returning by the coast of Asia, he again sailed to the south, sojqurned for three weeks at the Sandwich Islands, and on January 1, 1817, discovered New Year Island. After some further cruising in the Pacific he again proceeded north, but, a severe attack of illness compelling him to return to Europe, he reached the Neva on August 3, 1818, bringing home with him a large collection of previously unknown plants and much new ethnological information. In 1823 Kotzebue, now a captain, was entrusted with the command of a new expedition, in two ships of war, the main object of which was to take reinforcements to Kamchatka. There was, however, a staff of scientific men on board, who collected much valuable information and material in geography, ethnography, and natural history. The expedition left Cronstadt on August 23, and, proceeding by Cape Horn, visited the Radak and Society Islands, reaching Petropavlovsk in July 1824. Many positions along the coast were rectified, the Navigator Islands visited, and several discoveries made. The expedition returned by the Mariannes, Philippines, New California, and Sandwich Islands, reaching Cronstadt on July 10, 1826. There are English translations of both Kotzebue’s narratives: —A Voyage for the, Puιpose of Exploring a North-East Passage, undertaken in the years 1815-18, 3 vols. (1821); and A New Voyage Round the World in the years 1823-26 (1830). The narrative of the second voyage is generally considered to be rather highly coloured, while in the first Kotzebue animadverts in strong terms on the conduct of the English missionaries in the Society and Sandwich Islands, who, however, were defended both by Ellis and Mr Charles Darwin. Three years after his return from his second voyage, Kotzebue retired to his estate in Esthonia, where he died February 15, 1846.
