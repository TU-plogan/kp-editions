KOLHÁPUR, a native state in the Bombay Presidency, India, lying between 15° 58' and 17° 11' N. lat., and between 73° 45' and 74° 24' E. long.; it is bounded on the N. by Sâtâra district, on the E. and S. by the states of Sângli, Mirâj, and Kurunchwâd, and on the W. and S.W. by Sawantwâri state and Ratnâgiri district. The area is 3184 square miles. Kolhâpur state stretches from the heart of the Sahyâdri range eastwards into the plain of the Deccan. Along the spurs of the main chain of the Sahyâdri hills lie wild and picturesque hill slopes and valleys, producing little but timber, and till recently covered with rich forests. The centre of the state is crossed by several lines of low hills running at right angles from the main Sahyâdri range. In the east the country becomes more open, and presents the unpicturesque uniformity of a well-cultivated and treeless plain, broken only by an occasional river. Among the western hills are the ancient Marhattâ strongholds of Panhâla, Vishalgarh, Baura, and Rungna. The rivers, though navigable during the rains by boats of 2 tons burthen, are all fordable during the hot months. Iron ore is found in the Sahyâdri range, and smelting was formerly carried on to a considerable extent; but now the Kolhâpur mineral cannot compete with that imported from Europe. There are several good stone quarries. The principal agricultural products are rice, millet, sugar-cane, tobacco, cotton, safflower, and vegetables. The population of the state, including feudatories, was 802,691 in 1872, Hindus amounting to 95∣ per cent., and Mohammedans to 4 per cent. Pottery, hardware, and coarse cotton and woollen cloth are the principal manufactures. The chief exports are coarse sugar, tobacco, cotton, and grain; piece goods, salt, silk, sulphur, and spices are imported.

The râjâs of Kolhapur trace their descent from Bâjâ Ram, a younger son of Sivaji the Great, the founder of the Marhattâ power. The prevalence of piracy caused the British Government to send expeditions against Kolhapur in 1765 and 1792; and in the early years of this century the misgovernment of the chief compelled the British to resort to military operations, and ultimately to appoint an officer to manage the state. In 1862 a treaty was concluded with Sivaji III. The revenue of the state is estimated at £304,000. The military force consists of 1618 men. Exclusive of a few missionary institutions, there are in all 104 schools, attended by 5105 pupils. The climate is on the whole temperate.

Kolhapur, the capital of the above state, is situated in 16° 42' N. lat. and 74° 16Έ. long., 128 miles south by east of Poona. It is a picturesque, flourishing trading town, adorned with many handsome buildings. Population in 1872, 39,621.
