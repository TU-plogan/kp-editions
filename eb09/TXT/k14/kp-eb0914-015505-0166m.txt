KUNGUR, a district town of Russia, in the government of Perm, 58 miles south-south-east of the capital of the government, on the Sylva, a tributary of the Tchusovaya. Formerly a blockhouse erected to protect the Russian settlements against the Tartars, it has acquired commercial importance by manufacturing of boots, which are exported in great quantities to the mines of the Ural mountains and to the furthest gold-washings of western and eastern Siberia; more than 1500 men are engaged in this trade. There are also several tallow-melting houses, candle, soap, and glue works, tanneries, and a yard where steamers are made for the navigation of the Kama and its tributaries. The leather of Kungur, which is renowned for its quality, is sold in the eastern provinces of Russia, and reaches Orenburg and Irbit, whilst the tallow is sent to St Petersburg. The wharf on the Sylva is one of the most important in the basin of the Kama. Population, 10,800.
