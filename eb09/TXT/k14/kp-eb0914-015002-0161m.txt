KUBAN, a Russian district and government at the north-west extremity of the Caucasus, comprising the entire basin of the river of that name. It is bounded on the N. by the lands of the Don Cossacks and the steppes of Stavropol, E. by the watershed of the river basins of the Caspian and sea of Azoff, S. and S.W. by the Caucasian Alps, and W. by the Black Sea and Straits of Kertch. Its area comprises 27,728 square miles. Ekaterinodar, the chief town (population 30,000), is the residence of the governor, who, being also ataman in chief of the Kuban Cossacks, is invested with military and civil power. Climate varies greatly, the highest temperature reaching 104° Fahr., the lowest seldom falling below 10° Fahr. The country is very healthy, except in the lowlands, where fever prevails. The soil is of extreme fertility, yielding an abundance of wheat, •maize, and tobacco. Fruit, such as apples, pears, cherries, is plentiful, and the vine is cultivated with success near Temrouk and Taman. The upper valleys are richly covered with forests abounding in fir, oak, ash, beech, hornbeam, &c.; the lower parts consist of extensive pasture lands and swamps. The animals include the stag, roe-deer, bear, wild boar, wolf, fox, ibex, and chamois, also the bison (which, however, is very rare) in the virgin forests of the Teberda; numerous water-fowl, such as ducks, geese, swans, pelicans, also the pheasant, partridge, bustard, and mountain turkey. The rivers and lakes are plentifully supplied with fish, trout abounding in the mountain streams and the sturgeon at the delta of the river Kuban. The mineral wealth consists of coal, salt, petroleum, and ozokerite. The river Kuban (the ancient Hypanis, see Caucasus, vol. v. p. 254) is navigable in flat-bottomed boats over a distance of 100 miles between Temrouk and Ekaterinodar. The delta comprises several lakes.

It is on the upper banks of the Kuban that the Ass or Osses, and the enigmatic corner of Asia Propria, are believed to have been located. The history of the original settlements of the various native tribes named below, and their language and worship before the introduction of Mohammedanism, remain a blank page in the legends of the Caucasus. The peninsula of Taman, a land teeming with relics of ancient Greek colonists, has been occupied successively by the Cimmerians, Sarmatians, Khazars, Mongols, and other nations. The Genoese, who had established an extensive trade in the 13th century, were expelled by the Turks in 1484, and in 1784 Russia obtained by treaty the entire peninsula and the territory on the right bank of the Kuban,—the latter being granted by Catherine II. in 1792 to the Cossacks of the Dnieper. Then commenced the bloody struggle with the Circassians which continued for more than half a century. The mountaineers were finally subdued in 1864, and 400,000 of their number expatriated. Those, however, who elected to remain have become more prosperous than they had ever been. The population of Kuban, 862,473, embraces 510,038 Cossacks, 108,346 settlers of Russian origin, 4280 foreigners, and 95,602 natives. Cossack villages are military settlements, the men carrying arms as well as following the plough. They are exempt from the poll-tax (3 to 4 roubles) to which the others are subjected, but military service is compulsory, as is gratuitous labour in the construction and repair of roads, bridges, &c. Not only domestic but even field work is conducted mostly by women, remarkable for physical strength and endurance. Corn growing, the rearing of cattle, and fishing are the most profitable occupations. The native mountaineers, known under the general name of Circassians, but locally distinguished as the Karatchai, Abadsikb, Khakoutchy, Shapsough, have greatly altered their mode of life since the pacification of the Caucasus, still, however, maintaining Mohammedanism, speaking their vernacular, and strictly observing the customs of their ancestors. When during the late Russo-Turkish war insurrections broke out amongst the natives on the Terek, in Dagestan, and Abkhasia, these tribes remained peaceful and perfectly loyal. Their villages, especially those of the Karatchai, are striking examples of human industry, poverty being quite unknown; for the general emancipation in 1867 put an end to intestine strife, the predatory expeditions of former times, and the parasitic existence of numerous chiefs on the forced labour· of serfs. The native popula, tion, as well as the Cossacks, enjoy certain rights of self-government, and are allowed to hold meetings to that end. Exports include wheat, tobacco, leather, wool, petroleum, and live cattle; imports dry goods, grocery, and hardware. Local industry is limited to a few tanneries, petroleum refineries, and spirit distilleries; but Russian and foreign capitalists have of late obtained concessions for exploring the petroleum region stretching between Khadaji and Taman, and the coal-mines of Khumarinsky in the upper valley of the Kuban.
