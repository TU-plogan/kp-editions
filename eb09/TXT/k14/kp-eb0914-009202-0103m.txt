KIÔTO, Kiyôto, Miako, or Saikio, the ancient sacred capital of Japan, is situated on the main island of the Japanese archipelago. It occupies the level bottom of a valley between the ridges Hujei-zan and Higushiyama on the east, and of Tenno-san on the west, and is so girt by the streams Kamogawa and Kulunagawa as to have an almost insular position. With Tokio, to the north-east, it is connected by two highways, the Tôkaidô, 307 miles long, and the Nakasendô, 323 miles long. To Ozaka on the coast a railway line was opened in 1877. Kioto is regularly and compactly built on the rectangular system, the immense number of Shinto and Buddhist shrines and temples being almost entirely beyond the city proper. The large suburb beyond the Kamogawa, which is crossed by many bridges, is the finest in resnect of inns and temples. The houses, [9:14:93] chiefly of wood, are small, and are further dwarfed by the great width of the streets. Tea-houses and pleasuregardens abound, and the whole air of the city is pleasant. “With its schools, hospitals, lunatic asylum, prisons, dispensaries, alms-houses, fountains, public-parks, and gardens, exquisitely beautiful cemeteries, and streets of almost painful cleanliness, Kiyôto is the best-arranged and best-managed city in Japan.”^[1. Miss Bird, Unbeaten Tracks in Japan, vol. ii. p. 252. ] The chief building is, of course, the imperial palace surrounded by beautiful gardens. Formerly forbidden to even most natives, it is now occupied as a museum of Japanese arts and manufactures. Among the other buildings are the former residences of the taikun and of the mikado’s nobility, the various normal training and other schools for both sexes and all ages, the hospital, &c. Under the city government of Kioto there was founded in 1870 an industrial department to foster the industries of the place. There are divisions for the encouragement of gardening, shoe-making, silk and other weaving, paper-making, leather-making, the manufacture of mineral waters, and many other branches of industry. Kioto supports also a pauper colony. The silk-factories, though on a small scale, are numerous. Crape, bronze goods, and porcelain (largely for the English market) are also produced in the city. The population in 1870 was estimated at 370,000.

Kiδto is much A the oldest of the three great cities of Japan, but both Tôkio and Ozaka have far outstripped it in importance. In the reign of the emperor Kuwammu, towards the end of the 8th century, Nara was superseded as the capital by Kudzuno, afterwards called Kiδto, and sometimes Miako; and this last town became identified with the mikado, as Yedo was with the shδgun. It was the scene of the first contests of the Taira and Minumoto clans. In the 16th century Xavier preached in its streets; and in the 17th Kaempfer twice visited it. In 1864 a fierce contest, followed by a conflagration, resulted from an attack upon it by the Chδsiu clan and Kiheitai. After the revolution in 1869 the mikado and his court migrated to Yedo, thenceforth called Tokio or eastern capital. Kioto also received an alternative name,—Saikio, or western capital; but it is never used. Kiδto is not a treaty port; and foreigners are not allowed to reside in it unless they are in Japanese employ.
