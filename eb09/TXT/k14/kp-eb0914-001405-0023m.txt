KASTORIA, a town of European Turkey, in the vilayet of Monastir and sandjak of Prisrend, about 33 miles south of Monastir (Bitolia), on the western banks of a lake (6 miles Jong and 4 broad) which drains into the Indjeh, Karasu, or Bistritza. It is the seat of a caimmacam, and the inhabitants carry on a good trade. Of the twelve quarters of the town three are occupied by Turks, two by Jews, and the rest by Christians. Kastoria is the ancient Celetrum, captured by Sulpicius during the first Macedonian campaign, 200 B.C., and better known for the defence maintained by Bryennius against Alexis I. in 1084 (see Anna Comnenaâ€™s Alexias). A Byzantine wall with round towers runs across the peninsula on which part of the town is built. Population, 8000.
