KREUTZER, Conradin (1782-1849), German musical composer, owes his permanent fame almost exclusively to one opera, Das Nachtlager von Granada, which has kept the stage for nearly half a century in spite of the changes of taste. It is written in the style of Weber, and is remarkable especially for its flow of genuine melody and depth of feeling. The same qualities are found in Kreutzer’s part songs for men’s voices, which at one time were extremely popular in Germany, and are still listened to with pleasure. Amongst these Der Tag des Herrn (“ The Lord’s Day ”) may be named as the most excellent. It is [9:14:148] indeed a masterpiece of its kind. Kreutzer was a prolific composer, and wrote a number of operas which have disappeared from the stage and are not likely to be revived. His life also is devoid of interesting features, and may be summed up in few words. He was born November 22, 1782, at Mösskirch in Baden, and received his musical training from Albrechtsberger, the famous contrapuntist of Vienna. For the theatre of that city he composed most of his operas, including Das Nachtlager von Granada, produced in 1834. For a time (1812-1816) he was chapelmaster to the king of Wiirtemberg, and later on (1840) became conductor of the opera at Cologne. He died December 14, 1849, at Riga, where he had accompanied his daughter Cecilia Kreutzer, a singer of some renown.
