KEI ISLANDS, a group in the East Indian archipelago, consisting of one large and several smaller islands, situated about 5° 30 , S. lat. and 133° E. long., some 90 miles to the south of the western end of New Guinea, and between the southern Moluccas and the Aru islands. The name, which appears in a great variety of spellings—Kee, Ke, Key, Ki, &c.—has been in use among Europeans from the days of Valentijn downwards, and may be the Spanish Cayo, a rocky island. The natives call the group Evar, the chief island lut.

The Kei islands have been very frequently visited, but in such a cursory fashion for the most part that there is considerable doubt in regard even to their general cartography. Of Great Kei the outline and extent are known, but as to the other islands—often lumped together under the name of Lesser Kei—even the number of the more important has yet to be determined. Cape Borang, the northern point of Great Kei, lies in 5° 17 ’. Dullah-Darat, Dullah-Laut, Letman, and Hodjan are believed to be separate islands, though Dullah-Darat and Letman are parted only by a very narrow passage, and Letman and Hodjan may possibly be one. The seat of the rajah recognized by the Dutch Government as the chief authority in the group is Dullah on the west coast of Dullah-Darat.

The inhabitants of the Kei islands are supposed to number 18,000 or 20,000. A certain proportion of them (distinguished by the use of a special language and by the profession of Mohammedanism) are known to be descendants of natives of the Banda islands who had fled eastward before the encroachments of the Dutch. The great bulk of the people are still pagan, with rude statues of local deities and places of sacrifice indicated by flat-topped cairns. In physique the Kei islander is like the Aru islander, but more strongly built.

Cocoa-nuts, sago, fish, limestone, trepang, and timber are the chief productions of the islands. At Eli, on the east coast of Great Kei, there are extensive potteries which furnish earthenware for export as well as for local use.

The native proas are well built, after the shape of a whale-boat.
