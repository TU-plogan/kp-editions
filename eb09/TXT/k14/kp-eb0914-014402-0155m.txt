KOTRI, a town in Karâchi (Kurrachee) district, Sind, India, situated on the right bank of the Indus, in 25° 22' N. 1at. and 68° 22' E. long. The population in 1872, including the neighbouring hamlets of Khânpur and Miâne Mùltâni, was 7949—namely, 5166 Mohammedans, 2455 Hindus, 304 Christians, and 24 Parsis. Kotri is the northern terminus of the Sind Railway, which communicates with’ the seaport of Kurrachee (106 miles). The principal buildings, besides the Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, are the civil hospital, court-house, subordinate jail, post-office, Government and other schools, and travellers’ bungalow. The Indus Steam Flotilla maintains an extensive establishment, having its offices in the old fort, with workshops for the repair of steamers and barges. There is a large transit traffic in beer, wine, and spirits, metals, railway materials, piece goods, silk, wool, cotton, grain, oil-seeds, indigo, ghi, oil, saltpetre, and sugar. Water from Kotri is forwarded to Kurrachee, especially for the manufacture of ice and for drinking purposes. In 1878 the Indus Valley State Railway was opened from Kotri to Sukkur, by which the importance of Kotri as a place of transshipment has been greatly diminished.
