KONGSBERG, a mining town in the district of Buskerud, Norway, is situated on the Laagen, 500 feet above the sea, and about 60 miles south-west of Christiania by rail. With the exception of the church and the townhouse, the buildings are mostly of wood. The origin and whole industry of the town are connected with the Government silver-mines in the neighbourhood. Their first discovery was made by a peasant in 1623, since which time they have been worked with varying success. Over a hundred mines have been opened, but of these only three are now of any importance. The annual profit averages about Â£22,000. During last century Kongsberg was much more important than it now is, and contained more than double its present population. Dr Clarke in his Travels (1823) gives a good description of the place, and mentions a mass of native silver, nearly 600 lb in weight, found there, which is preserved in the museum at Copenhagen. Within tho town of Kongsberg are situated the smeltingworks, the mint, and a Government weapon factory. The population of the town in 1875 was 4311.
