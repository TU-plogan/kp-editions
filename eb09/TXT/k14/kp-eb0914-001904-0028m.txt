KAYE, Sικ John William (1814-1876), historian, was born in 1814, the son of a solicitor. Educated at Eton and Addiscombe Royal Military College, he served as an officer in the Bengal artillery till 1841, when he exchanged his sword for the pen. In 1856 he entered the service of the East India Company in England; and, when next year the crown assumed the government of India, Kaye sue-ceeded[9:14:20] John Stuart Mill as secretary in the political and secret department of the India office. In 1871 he was created a knight of the Star of India. In 1874 his failing health warned him to resign his post; and he died in London, July 24, 1876. To his historical and biographical writings Sir John Kaye brought an historical sagacity, an honesty of purpose, and a military knowledge that make them at once valuable and interesting.

His best known works are his History of the Sepoy War, 3 vols. , 1864; History of the War in Afghanistan, 2 vols., 1851; and his Life of Lord Metcalfe, 2 vols., 1854. He was the author also of Peregrine Pultney (1844) and Long Engagements (1861), two Indian novels; History of the Administration of the East India Company, 1853; Life of Henry Tucker, 1854; Life of Sir John Malcolm, 2 vols., 1856; History of Christianity in India, 1859; Lives of Indian Officers, 2 vols., 1867; Essays of an Optimist, 1870; and numerous contributions to periodicals.
