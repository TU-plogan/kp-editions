KHARTÚM or Khartoum (erroneously Karturn), the chief town of the Egyptian Sùdân, situated in 15° 37' N. 1at., and 22° 54' E. long., on the peninsula formed by the junction of the White and the Blue Nile. The level of the stream just below the town is 1240 feet. The principal landing-place and the dockyards are on the Blue river. The surrounding country is flat and open, the forest described by the first European visitors having disappeared for a considerable distance up the river, but there are many gardens within and around the town planted with date-palms, fig and orange trees, &c. The town, though consisting chiefly of mean mud-built huts, has a considerable number of substantial modern buildings, the most imposing of which is the stone-faced palace of the governor. As the centre of the great caravan routes from the interior of Africa, Khartùm carries on a good legitimate trade, but the inhabitants have always shown a preference for slave traffic when the governor has proved indulgent or inefficient. Khartιim is the seat of a Roman Catholic mission founded by Pope Gregory XVI. in 1846, and long conducted by Dr Ignaz Knoblecher, of Protestant missions, and of several European consulates. The British consulate, established in 1849, and latterly held by Petherick, was abolished in 1864 under circumstances which gave rise to much comment. The population amounts to 50,000, including in addition to the natives the usual medley elements of an Egyptian town.

Khartùm was founded by Mohammed Aly in 1823. In 1859 the population was estimated at 40,000. In 1869-70 the disturbed state of the country had brought the number down to 15,000, but since then the recovery has been rapid.

See Lord Pradhoe in Joτιrn. R. Geog. Soc. 1832; G. Melly, Khartoum, &c., 1851; Heuglin, Reise n. Abessinien, 1868; Schweinfurth, Heart of Africa, 1873; Hansal, Briefe aus Chartum, 1856 and 1880. Details regarding the Roman Catholic mission will be found in the last work; in Jahresberichte of the Marienverein; and in Zeitschr. f. allg. Erdk., 1858 and 1861.
