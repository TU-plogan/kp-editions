KRUMMACHER. Three members of this family have attained some popularity as religious writers in Germany and indeed throughout Reformed Protestant Christendom.

1. Friedrich Adolf Krummacher was born July 13, 1768, at Tecklenburg, Westphalia, studied theology at Lingen and Halle, and became successively rector of the grammar school at Mörs, professor of theology at Duisburg, preacher at Crefeld and afterwards at Kettwich, consisto rialrath and superintendent in Bernburg, and pastor of the Ansgariuskirche in Bremen (1824), where he died on 14th April 1845. He was the author of numerous religious works, but is best known by his Parabeln, first published in 1805, which have gone through numerous German editions (9th ed., Essen, 1876), and have been translated into English and other European languages.

2. Gottfried Daniel Krummacher, born at Tecklenburg, April 1, 1774, was pastor successively in Bär], Wulfrath, and Elberfeld. He was the leader of the “pietists” of Wupperthal, and published several volumes of sermons, including one entitled Israel's Wanderings. His death occurred on January 30, 1837.

3. Friedrich Wilhelm Krummacher, son of Friedrich Adolf, was born at Mörs, January 28,1796, studied theology at Halle and Jena, and became pastor successively at Ruhrort (1823) and Gemarke, near Barmen (1825). In 1847 he received an appointment to theDreifaltigkeitskirche in Berlin, and in 1853 he became court preacher at Potsdam. He died December 10, 1868. F. W. Krummacher was an influential promoter of the Evangelical Alliance. His best known works are Plias der Thisbiter (1828-33; 6th ed. 1874), well known to English readers, and Elisa (1837), also translated, but much less popular both in England and Germany than its predecessor. He published several volumes of sermons, and an Autobiography appeared in 1869.
