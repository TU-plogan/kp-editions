KARS, a fortified town of Armenia, formerly at the head of a sandjak in the Turkish vilayet of Erzeroum, but since 1878 the centre of a territory attached to the Russian governor-generalship of the Caucasus. It is situated in 40° 36' 52" N. lat. and 43° 5' 76" E. long., 30 miles south-west of Alexandropol (Gumri) and 130 miles north-east of Erzeroum, on the eastern end of a spur of the Soghanli Dagh, the site of the town proper being cut off from the rest of the range by the Kars Tchai, a sub-tributary of the Araxes. There are three considerable suburbs—Orta Kapi to the south, Bairam Pasha to the east, and Timur Pasha on the western side of the river. To the south-eastward opens up a vast plain. Owing to the bareness of the dark basalt hills, and the sombre colour of the buildings, a touch of melancholy mingles with the picturesqueness of the view. At the north-west corner of the town, overhanging the river, rises the ancient citadel (the Itch Kaleh of the Turks), which in earlier times was a strong military post, but is now of almost no moment in a regular siege, being commanded completely by several of the surrounding eminences. The value of the position depends on the line of forts, and even this is greatly diminished by the fact that they are disposed in a circuit of about 10 miles round the town. Of chief importance are the works on the Kara Dagh heights to the north-east and the line on the heights above the left bank of the river. The population of Kars was at one time estimated at 40,000; but, according to Baron von Seidlitz, it had in 1878 only 8672 inhabitants (including 7330 Turks, 1191 Armenians, 138 Greeks).

Though during the 9th and 10th centuries the seat of an independent Armenian principality, Kars has nothing to boast of beyond its military fame. The citadel, it would appear, was built by Amurath III. during the war with Persia, in the close of the 16th century. It was strong enough to stand a siege by Nadir Shah in 1731, and in 1807 it successfully resisted the Russians. After a brave defence it surrendered on 23d June 1828 to the Russian general Paskievitch, 11,000 men becoming prisoners of war. During the Crimean war the Turkish garrison, guided and stimulated by General Williams (afterwards knighted as Sir W. Fenwick Williams of Kars) and other foreign officers, kept the Russians gallantly at bay during a protracted siege; but, after the garrison had been devastated by cholera, and food had utterly failed, nothing was left but to capitulate (November 1855). The fortress was again stormed by the Russians in the war of 1877-78.
