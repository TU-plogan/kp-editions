KERAK, a town of Syria, situated about 10 miles east of the southern end of the Dead Sea, on the summit of a rocky hill some 3000 feet above sea-level. * It stands upon a platform forming an irregular triangle with sides of 800 to 1000 yards in length, and separated by deep ravines from the higher encircling ranges on all sides except one, where a narrow neck connects it with a neighbouring hill. The whole place was formerly surrounded by a wall with five towers, with only two entrances through tunnels in the side of the cliff. The town is an irregular mass of about six hundred flat mud-roofed houses. The Christian quarter contains the Greek church of St George; and the present mosque still bears marks of its Christian origin. On the north-west is the tower or castle of Bibars (see vol. vii. p. 755), with an inscription bearing his name. The great castle at the southern angle was built as a crusading fortress about 1131. Relics of the Roman occupation of Kerak have been found. The inhabitants are estimated at 8000, of whom about one-fourth are Greek Christians. They are fierce and truculent; and, though they were formerly renowned for hospitality, their rapacious treatment of their European visitors has brought them into very bad repute.

Kerak is the ancient Kir-Hareseth or Kir-Moab (2 Kings iii. 25; Isa. XV. 1, xvi. 7). The name Kerak (Syriac Karkâ, fortress) is as old as 2 Macc. xii. 17. In crusading times Kerak was a highly important point. In 1188 it was captured by Saladin (vol. vii. p. 753), and under his dynasty the town prospered. In the early part of the present century Kerak was governed by a powerful sheikh, paying nominal homage to the Wahhaby kingdom; it is now the residence of a Turkish official and garrison under the waly of Jerusalem, but the authority of the government is weak. A considerable trade is carried on by merchants from Hebron.
