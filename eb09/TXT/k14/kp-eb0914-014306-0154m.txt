KOSTROMA, a central government of Russia in Europe, surrounded by those of Vologda, Vyatka, Nijni-Novgorod, Vladimir, and Yaroslav, lies mostly on the left bank of the upper Volga, and has an estimated area of 32,700 square miles. Its surface is generally undulating, with hilly tracts on the right bank of the Volga, and extensive flat and marshy districts in its eastern parts. The rocks belong chiefly to the Permian system, a small tract being occupied by representatives of the Jurassic, and both being deeply covered with Quaternary clays. The soil in the east is for the most part sand or a sandy clay; a few patches are covered with fertile black earth. Immense forests, yielding excellent timber for shipbuilding, and in many cases still untouched, occupy no less than 70 per cent, of the surface of the government (13,230,000 acres in 1870). The export of timber is greatly facilitated by a series of navigable tributaries of the Volga, such as the Kostroma, Unzha, Neya, and Vyksa, and many others of less importance. The climate is severe; frosts of - 22° Fahr, are common in January, and the mean temperature of the year is but 3°∙1 (summer, 64° ’ 5; winter, - 13° ’ 3). The population, which numbered 1,176,000 in 1870, is Russian, with some Meryas,—the indigenes of this part of Russia,— Tcheremisses, and Tartars. Agriculture is in a low state of development; only 4,000,000 acres are under crops, with a return (1,415,000 quarters of corn in 1877) unequal to the wants of the population. Flax is cultivated to some extent, and exported. Stock-breeding has steadily decreased since 1861; in 1870 there were only 394,500 homed cattle (against 420,000 in 1857), and the number has since much decreased. Bee keeping is an important branch of industry in some districts. The chief articles of commerce are timber, fuel, pitch, tar, mushrooms (yearly value upwards of £5000), and various kinds of wooden wares for building and household purposes, which are largely manufactured by the peasantry in villages, and exported to the steppe provinces of the lower Volga and Don. Boat-building for river traffic is also carried on. Some other small industries, such as the manufacture of silver and copper wares, leather wares, &c., are also prosecuted in the villages; but the trade in linen and towelling, formerly the staple, is now declining. There are now several cotton factories, spinning mills, and engineering and chemical works. The government of Kostroma is divided into twelve districts :—Kostroma, Nerekhta, Kineshma, Makarieff, Yurievets, Galitch, Tchukhloma, Soligalitch, Boui, Kologriv, Vetluga, and Varnavin.

Kostroma, a town of Russia, capital of the government of the same name, 230 miles north-east of Moscow and 55 miles from Yaroslav, It is situated on the left bank of the Volga, at the mouth of the navigable Kostroma river, with suburbs on the opposite side of the Volga. It is one of the oldest towns of Russia, having been founded by Youri Dolgorouky in 1152. Its fort was often the refuge of the great princes of Moscow during war, but the town was plundered more than once by Tartars. The cathedral, built in the 13th century, and situated in the Kreml, or former citadel, is a fine monument of old Russian architecture. Kostroma has been renowned since the 16 th century for its linen, which was exported to Holland, and the manufacture of linen and linen-yarn is still carried to some extent, flax being purchased in the governments of Kostroma and of Pskoff. There are also in the town and in its province several important cotton-mills, tanneries, saw-mills, an iron-foundry, and a machine factory. Owing to its situation on the Volga, and at the mouth of a navigable river, Kostroma carries on an active trade—importing grain and exporting linen, linen-yarn, leather, and especially timber and wooden wares. Population, 30,000.
