KASCHAU (Hung., Kassa; Lat., Cassovia), an ancient royal free town, and capital of the cis-Tisian county of Abauj, Hungary, is pleasantly situated on the right bank of the Hernâd, in a valley surrounded by sloping vineyards, about 130 miles north-east from Budapest, with which city, as also with Cracow, Lemberg, and other centres, it is connected by railway, 48° 42' N. lat., 21° 17' E. long. Kaschau is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop suffragan of Eger (Erlau), the headquarters of the general administration for the county, and has royal and magisterial courts of law, as well as boards of assay, finance, and postal direction, and the supervision of the tobacco manufacture. Kaschau is one of the best built towns in Hungary, and consists of the inner town, intersected by the Csermel, which forms an island and is crossed by several bridges, and three suburbs (upper, middle, and lower) approached by a broad glacis. The most remarkable edifice, considered the grandest masterpiece of architectural skill in Hungary, is the cathedral of St Elizabeth, situated in the great square, and built in a faultless Gothic style. Commenced about 1270 by Stephen V., the structure was continued 1324-82 by Queen Elizabeth, wife of Charles I., and her son Louis I., and finished about 1468, in the reign of Matthias I. (Corvinus). The interior was transformed in the 18th century to the Renaissance style, and restored in 1859-65. The church of St Michael and the Franciscan or Garrison church date from the 13th century. The royal law academy, founded in 1659, and sanctioned by golden bull of King Leopold I. in 1660, has an extensive library; there are also a museum, a Roman Catholic upper gymnasium and seminary for priests, and other schools and benevolent institutions. Kaschau is the centre of the trade for the surrounding counties in wine, gall-nuts, salt, and most descriptions of grain, and from its commercial importance forms a kind of provincial capital. About 3 miles north-west of the town are the baths of Banké, with alkaline and ferruginous springs. The population of Kaschau in 1880 amounted to 26,422 (in 1870 it was 21,742), consisting of Magyars, Germans, Slovaks, and Ruthens. The majority are Roman Catholics.

Kaschau consisted originally of two villages, Upper and Lower Kassa, of which the latter was created a town and granted special privileges by Béla IV. (1235). Under Stephen V. (1270) the two separate portions λvere united, and raised to the rank of a royal free town. In 1290 it was surrounded with walls. The subsequent history presents a long record of revolts, sieges, and disastrous conflagrations. In 1430 the plague earned off a great number of the inhabitants. In 1458 the right of minting money according to the pattern and value of the Buda coinage was granted to the municipality by King Matthias I. The bishopric was established in 1804. In the revolutionary war of 1848-49 the Hungarians were twice defeated before the walls of Kaschau by the Austrians under General Schlick, and the town was held successively by the Austrians, Hungarians, and Russians.
