KOLDING, a town in the district of Veile, Denmark, is situated on the east coast of the province of Jutland, on the Koldingfjord, an inlet of the Little Belt. It has some little shipping, but its harbour is not deep. A little to the north-west is the splendid ruin of the royal castle Kolding-huus, formerly called Oernsborg or Arensborg. It was begun by Duke Abel in 1248; in 1808 it was burned. The large square tower was built by Christian IV. (1588- 1648), and was surmounted by colossal statues, of which one is still standing. The name of Kolding occurs in the 10th century; but its earliest known town-rights date from 1321. In 1644 it was the scene of a Danish victory over the Swedish, and iu 1849 of a Danish defeat by the Schleswig-Holstein troops. The population in 1870 was 5400.
