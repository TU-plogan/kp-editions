KÖLCSEY, Ferencz or Francis (1790-1838), a distinguished Hungarian poet, critic, and orator, was born at Szöderneter, in Transylvania, on the 8th of August 1790. His parents both died during his childhood, leaving him to the care of a trusted female servant. At an early age Kölcsey was sent to the Calvinistic school at Debreczen, where he acquired a sound knowledge of the Latin and Greek classics, as also of the leading Hungarian and German poets. In his fifteenth year he made the acquaintance of Kazinczy, and zealously adopted his linguistic reforms. In 1809 Kölcsey went to Pest with the intention of following the legal profession, and became a “notary to the royal board.” The public career of a lawyer, however, proving distasteful to him, he soon left the city, and, secluding himself at Cseke in Szatmâr county, devoted his time to aesthetical study, poetry, criticism, and the defence of the theories of Kazinczy. Kölcsey’s early metrical pieces contributed to the Transylvanian Museum did not attract much attention, whilst his severe criticisms of Csokonai, Kis, and especially Berzsenyi, published in 1817, rendered him very unpopular. From 1821 to 1826 he published many separate poems of great beauty in the Aurora, Hebe, Aspasia, and other magazines of polite literature. Having by these means again risen iu the estimation of the literary public, he was induced by Paul Szemere to join him in the production of a new periodical, styled Diet cs Literatura (“Life and Literature”), which appeared from 1826 to 1829, in 4 vols., and gained for Kölcsey the highest reputation as a critical writer. About this time his powers as an orator began to be displayed in his capacity of upper notary to the county of Szatmàr. From 1832 to 1835 he sat in the Hungarian diet, where his extreme liberal views and his singular eloquence soon rendered him famous as a parliamentary leader. In the meantime he had not been inactive as a literary savant. Elected on the 17th November 1830 a member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, he took part in its first grand meeting; in 1832 be delivered his famous oration on Kazinczy, and in 1836 that on his former opponent Daniel Berzsenyi. When in 1838 Baron Wesselényi was unjustly thrown into prison upon a charge of treason, Kölcsey eloquently though unsuccessfully conducted his defence; and he died about a week afterwards (2 4th of August) from internal inflammation. His collected works, in 6 vols., were published at Pest, 1840-48, and his journal of the diet of 1832-36 appeared in 1848. A monument erected to the memory of Kölcsey was unveiled at Szatmâr-Németi on the 25th of September 1864.
