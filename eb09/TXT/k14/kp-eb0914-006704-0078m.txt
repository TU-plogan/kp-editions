KHULNA, or Culna, a town in Jessor district, Bengal, India, situated at the point where the Bhairab river debouches on the Sundarban delta, in 22 c 49' N. lat., 89Â° 57' E. long., may be described as the capital of the Sundarbans[9:14:68], and for the last hundred years at least has been a place of considerable importance. It was the headquarters of the salt department under the East Indian Company. The whole boat traffic from the east and north-east passes here on its way to Calcutta; from Calcutta the principal cargo is Liverpool salt, the trade in which is very considerable. There are numerous sugar refineries.
