KREMENETZ, a district town of Russia, in the government of Volhynia, in the high valley of the Ikva, one of the tributaries of the basin of the Pripat, situated 30 miles east from Radziviloff, the great custom-house on the railway between Kieff and Lvoff. It is a poor place, the 11,800 inhabitants of which follow agriculture, raise tobacco, and excavate flint. But the Jews, who are numerous in the town, carry on a brisk trade in grain, which is stored here for export to Galicia and Odessa. The picturesque ruins of an old castle on a crag close by the town, are usually known under the name of the castle of Queen Bona; it was built, however, but in the 8th or 9th century. The hordes of Batyi vainly besieged it in 1241 and 1255. From that time Kremenetz was alternately under the dominion of Lithuania and Poland, till 1648, when it was taken by the Zaporojtzi Cossacks. During the years 1805 to 1832 its Polish lyceum was the centre of superior instruction for the western provinces of Little Russia; but after the Polish insurrection of 1831 the lyceum was transferred to Kieff, and is now the university of that town.
