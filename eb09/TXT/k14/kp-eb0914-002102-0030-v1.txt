KEAN, Charles John (1811-1868), tragedian, son of Edmund Kean noticed below, was born at Waterford, Ireland, 18th January 1811. In his fourteenth year he was sent to Eton College, where he remained three years. The name of Kean secured him an engagement at Drury Lane Theatre, where he made his debut 1st October 1827, in the character of Norval, but failed to create a very favourable impression, his talents being such as required long practice and careful study for their development; and his continued failure to achieve popularity led him to leave London in the spring of 1828 for the provinces. After a visit to America in 1830, where he was received with much favour, he in 1833 appeared at Covent Garden as Sir Edmund Mortimer, but his success was not pronounced enough to encourage him to remain long in London, especially as he had already in the provinces won a high position. In January 1838 he returned to Drury Lane, and played Hamlet with a success which gave him a place among the principal tragedians of his time. After his marriage with the actress Miss Ellen Tree in 1842, he paid a second visit to America. Returning to England in 1847, he entered on a successful engagement at the Haymarket, and in 1850, along with Mr Kelly, he became lessee of the Princess Theatre. The most noteworthy feature of his management was a series of gorgeous Shakespearean revivals. Charles Kean cannot be called a great tragic actor. He did all that could be done by the persevering cultivation of his powers, and in many ways manifested the possession of high intelligence and refined taste, but his defects of person and voice made it impossible for him to give a representation at all adequate of the varying and subtle emotions characteristic of pure tragedy. In melodramatic parts such as Louis XI. and the Corsican Brothers his success was unequivocal and complete. From his “tour round the world” Kean returned in 1866 in broken health, and he died at London, January 22, 1868.

The Life and Theatrical Times of Charles Kean, by John William Cole, appeared in 1860 in two volumes.
