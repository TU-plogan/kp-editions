KOTAH, a native state in Râjputâna, India, situated between 24° 30' and 25° 51' N, lat., and 74° 40' and 76° 59' E. long. It is entirely surrounded by native territory, being bounded on the N. by Bundi, on the E. by Gwalior and Tonk, on the S. by Jhalâwâr, and on the W. by Udâipur. The area is 3797 square miles, with an estimated [9:14:144] population of 310,000. Kotah slopes gently northwards from the high table-land of Mâlwâ, and is drained by the Chambal with its tributaries, all flowing in a northerly or north-easterly direction. The Mokandarra range, from 1200 to 1600 feet above sea-level, runs from south-east to north-west, forming the southern border of Kotah, and separating it from Jhalâwâr. The Mokandarra Pass through these hills, in the neighbourhood of the highest peak (1671 feet), has been rendered memorable by the passage of Colonel Monson’s army on its disastrous retreat in 1804. The defile is strikingly picturesque, and forms one of the chief outlets between the Deccan and northern India. There are extensive game preserves, chiefly covered with grass. In addition to the usual Indian grains, wheat, cotton, opium, and a little tobacco of good quality are cultivated The manufactures are very limited Cotton fabrics are woven, but are being rapidly superseded by the cheap products of Bombay and Manchester. Articles of wooden furniture are also constructed. The chief articles of export are opium and grain; salt, cotton, and woollen cloth are imported.

Kotah is an offshoot from Bundi state, having been bestowed upon a younger son of the Bundi raja by the emperor Shah Jahan in return for services rendered him when the latter was in rebellion against his father Jahangir. The affairs of the state having fallen into confusion, the administration is now superintended by a British political officer. Many of the state nobility hold lands on a semi-feudal tenure. The estimated gross revenue of the state in 1876 was £253,275, of which the land yielded over £170,000. Tribute of £38,472 (including maintenance of a contingent known as the Deoli Irregular Force) is paid to the British Government, and £1439 to Jeypore. The climate is very sultry during the prevalence of the hot winds at the commencement of summer, and is considered unhealthy during the rainy season. Endemic feveoe invariably appear after the close of the rains.
