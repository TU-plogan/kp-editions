KEMBLE, John Mitchell (1807-1857), Anglo-Saxon scholar and historian, eldest son of Charles Kemble noticed above, was born in 1807. He received his education partly from Dr Richardson, author of the Dictionary of the English Langτιage, and partly at the grammar school of Bury St Edmunds, where he obtained in 1826 an exhibition to Trinity College, Cambridge. At school he was distinguished for his miscellaneous knowledge, and at the university his essays on historical subjects gained him high reputation. The historical bent of his studies was confirmed and turned more especially towards the Anglo-Saxon period through the influence of the brothers Grimm, under whom he studied at Göttingen. His thorough knowledge of the Teutonic speeches was shown in his Beowulf (1833-37), Ceber die Stammtafel der Westsachsen (1836), Codex Diplomaticus Aevi Saxoηici (1839), and in many contributions to reviews; while his History of the Saxons in England (1849) was the first attempt at a thorough examination of the original sources of the early period of English history. He was also for some time editor of the Foreign Quarterly Review. In 1857 he published State Papers and Correspondence illustrative of the Social and Political State of Europe from the Revolution [9:14:31] to the Accession of the House of Hanover. He died at Dublin 26th March 1857. His Horse Ferales, ar Studies in the Archaeology of Northern Nations, was completed by Dr Latham, and published in 1864.
