KISFALUDY, Sândor or Alexander (1772-1844), elder brother of Kâroly Kisfaludy, whom he excels as a lyric poet though not as a dramatist, was born on the 27th of September 1772 at Sümeg in the county of Zala, Hungary. Choosing the career of a soldier, he entered the army in 1793, and was soon appointed to a lieutenancy in the Hungarian life guards at Vienna. There he employed his spare time in literary pursuits, and especially in the study of Italian poets. Upon the death of his patron Prince Anton Eszterhâzy, Kisfaludy was sent back to Hungary. Soon after this, at a vintage festival in Badacsony, he made the acquaintance of Rozalia Szegedy, whom, notwithstanding a subsequent long estrangement, he eventu ally married, and who under the name of Liza is the subject of his Himfy. During the Italian campaign of 1796 Kisfaludy was stationed at Milan, and upon the surrender of that city he was sent as a prisoner of war to Vaucluse, where he began to write the series of love sonnets for which he afterwards became so famous, and which were suggested to his mind by the songs of Petrarch. After his release at the peace of Campo Formio (17th October 1797), Kisfaludy was posted as captain in a regiment quartered at Würtemberg, and in 1799 he took part in the battles of Stockach, Winterthur, and Zürich. In 1800 he left the army, and stayed for five years at Kâm in the county of Vas, subsequently removing to his native place Sümeg, where he devoted himself to agricultural and literary pursuits. By this time Kisfaludy had gained the highest reputation as a lyric poet by his Loves of Himfy, the first part of which, published anonymously at Buda in 1801, was received with such applause as had never before been accorded to any Magyar work. The second part appeared under his own name in 1807. On the “insurrectio,” or general rising of the Hungarian nobles against Napoleon, in 1809, Kisfaludy accepted the post of major of cavalry, and was also nominated by the palatine one of his adjutants. After his return to private life Kisfaludy wrote several dramatic pieces, and from 1820 contributed largely to his brother’s annual Aurora. In 1818 he gained the Marczibânyi prize for his Ballads (2d edition, Buda, 1818), which work was translated into German by Gaal (Vienna, 1820); and in 1831 he was elected member of the Hungarian academy of sciences, in the formation of which he had taken an active part. He died on the 28th of October 1844, at the age of seventy-two. His collective works, in 6 vols., were published at Pest in 1847 by Toldy. Exquisite metrical English renderings of several verses from the Himfy will be found in Sir John Bowring’s Poetry of the Magyars (London, 1830).
