KILIAN, St, the apostle of Franconia, was, according to Hrabanus Maurus, a native of Ireland, whence along with his companions he went to eastern Franconia. After having preached the gospel in Würzburg, the whole party were put to death by the orders of an unjust judge of the name of Gozbert. Notker Balbulus (c. 912) relates that Kilian’s mission emanated from the pope, and that Gozbert was the duke of Franconia, who, after receiving baptism, had been persuaded to put away his wife (Geila) because she was his brother’s widow. Geila in revenge caused Kilian and his comrades, Coloman and Totman, to be secretly put to death. Later accounts assign the mission to the time of Conon (686). In the Martyrologies Saints Kilian (Kyllena, Chilianus), Coloman, and Totman are commemorated on July 8. Their relics lie in the cathedral (St Kiliansmünster) at Würzburg.
