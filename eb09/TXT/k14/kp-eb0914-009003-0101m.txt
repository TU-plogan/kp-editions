KINGSTOWN, a seaport town of Ireland, in the county of Dublin, is situated at the south-eastern extremity of Dublin Bay, 6 miles south-east from Dublin by railway.

It is a large seaport and favourite watering-place, and possesses several fine streets and terraces commanding picturesque sea views. The original name of Kingstown was Dunleary, which was exchanged for the present designation after the embarkation of George IV. at the port on his return from Ireland in 1821, an event which is also commemorated by a granite obelisk erected near the harbour. The town was a mere fishing village until the construction of an extensive harbour, begun in 1817 from designs by Rennie, and finally completed in 1859, at a cost of £825,000. The eastern pier has a length of 3500 feet, and the western of 4950 feet, the total area enclosed being about 250 acres, with a varying depth of from 15 to 27 feet. Kingstown is the station of the mail packets to Holyhead in connexion with the London and North-Western Railway. It has a large export and import trade both with Great Britain and foreign countries, but as its shipping returns are now included in those of the port of Dublin, it is impossible to give accurate details. The principal exports are cattle, and the principal imports corn and provisions. The harbour revenue exceeds £2000 annually. By the Towns’ Improvement Act of 1854, Kingstown, with several surrounding districts^ was formed into a township, having an area of 1450 acres. The population in 1861 was 14,257, which in 1871 had increased to 16,378, and in 1881 to 18,230.
