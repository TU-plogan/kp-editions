KURILE ISLANDS, a chain of islands to the northeast of Asia, extending for about 795 miles from the southern extremity of the peninsula of Kamchatka to the northern extremity of Yezo, and forming the boundary between the Sea of Okhotsk and the outer ocean. Till 1875 the Little or Northern Kuriles belonged to Russia, and the Great or Southern Kuriles to Japan, but by the treaty of that date they were all recognized as Japanese. The principal islands, beginning at the north, are Shumshu (226 square miles), Paramushir (1135), Onekotan (244), Kharimkotan, Si Musir (161), Matua, Urup (563), Iturup (2656), and Kunashir. Like the peninsula of Kamchatka, the whole chain is of volcanic origin, and several of the islands—Yekarma, Musir, Raikoke, Matua, Iturup—are still centres of volcanic activity. Mr Milne, who cruised among the islands in 1878, counted fifty-two well-defined volcanic peaks, and at least seventeen are known to give off steam. The peak of the island of Alaid, estimated to have an altitude of at least 12,000 feet, had two great eruptions in 1770 and 1793. None of the other eminences exceed 5000 feet in height. As the slopes are for the most part exceedingly regular, the production of the volcanoes must be assigned to a comparatively recent period; and the absence of stratification seems to indicate a continuity of action. The forces at work must have been enormous if, as appears probable, the chain was built up from the bed of the sea. To the east of the islands the “Challenger” expedition found a depth of 27,930 feet. The flora of the Kuriles is poor, especially towards the north; in the southern islands it is similar to that of Yezo. In Kunashir, Urup, and Iturup there are well-wooded portions. Sea-otters, wolves, and foxes are among the wild animals hunted for their skins. Many of the islands are altogether uninhabited, and none have more than the scantiest population. In 1868-70 Knipping estimated the total at from 200 to 300 persons, and since the treaty of 1875 a large number have removed to Saghalien and other parts of Russian territory. Ethnographically the people of the Kuriles are in the main identical with the Ainos of Yezo, those of the northern islands showing the influence of intercourse with Kamchatka. They are quiet, timorous, and well-behaved, do not practise polygamy, and carefully avoid intermarriage between blood relations. The poorer people burn their dead, the wealthier embalm them. Once a year in autumn they hold a great feast. Of a supreme deity they have some indistinct idea, but they sacrifice to the sun, the moon, and the sea, and worship the bear.

The Kurile Islands were discovered in 1634 by the Dutch navigator De Vrees. The Russians first learned about them from Japanese traders who visited Kamchatka in 1711; in the following year two Cossacks, Antsuiphoroff and Kozuirevskii, crossed over to Shumshu; and in 1766-67 a voyage was made among the islands to collect a fur tax. In 1795 a factory of the Russian American Company was established on Urup. Captain Golovnin was taken prisoner by the Japanese on Kunashir in 1811.
