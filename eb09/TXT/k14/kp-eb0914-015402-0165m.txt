KULLU, a valley and subdivision of Kângrâ district, Punjab, India, situated between 31° 20' and 32° 26' N. lat., and 76° 58' and 77° 50' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the central Himâlayan range, on the S. by the Sutlej river, on the S.W. by the Dhâoladar or Outer Himalaya, Bias river, and the states of Suket and Mandi, and on the W. by Bâra Bangaliâl hills. The Sainj, which joins the Bias at Lârgi, divides the tract into two portions, Kullu Proper and Siorâj. Kullu Proper, north of the Sainj, together with Inner Seorâj, forms a great basin or depression in the midst of the Himâlayan systems, having the narrow gorge of the Bias at Sârgi as the only outlet for its waters, North and east the Bâra Bangaliâl and Mid-Himâlayan ranges rise to a mean elevation of 18,000 feet, while southward the Jalori and Dhâoladhar ridges attain a height of 11,000 feet. The greater portion of Kullu must thus ever remain an utter wilderness. The higher villages stand 9000 feet above the sea; and even the cultivated tracts have probably an average elevation of 5000 feet. The houses consist of four-storied châlets in little groups, huddled closely together on the ledges or slopes of the valleys, picturesquely built with projecting eaves and carved wooden verandahs. The Bias, which, with its tributaries, drains the entire basin, rises at the crest of the Rohtang Pass, 13,326 feet above the sea, and has an average fall of 125 feet per mile. Its course presents a succession of magnificent scenery, including cataracts, gorges, precipitous cliffs, and mountains clad with forests of deodar, towering above the tiers of pine on the lower rocky ledges. Great mineral wealth exists, but the difficulty of transport and labour will probably always prevent its proper development. Hot springs occur at three localities, much resorted to as places of pilgrimage.

The census of 1872 disclosed a population of 90,313, spread over an area of 1926 square miles—Hindus numbering 90,206; Mohammedans, 100; and Christians, 7. The character of the hillmen resembles that of most other mountaineers in its mixture of simplicity, independence, and superstition. Tibetan polyandry still prevails in Seorâj, but has almost died out elsewhere. The temples are dedicated rather to local deities than to the greater gods of the Hindu pantheon. Out of a total of 799,834 acres, only 32,884 are returned as actually under cultivation. The staple spring crops include wheat, barley, poppy, tobacco, and oil-seeds; the autumn crops are maize, rice, pulses, and millets. Tea cultivation has recently been introduced into the valley. Rice, wheat, opium, tobacco, tea, and honey are exported. Manufactures are almost unknown. The climate is not healthy. Intermittent fevers and bowel complaints are endemic, while epidemics of virulent contagious fever and cholera break out from time to time. Goitre and cretinism also occur. The average annual rainfall ranges from 45 to 50 inches. The mean temperature in August is 78° Fahr., iu November 55°.
