KAZINCZY, Ferencz or Francis (1759-1831), an Hungarian author, known as the most indefatigable agent in the regeneration of the Magyar language and literature at the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th century, was born 27th October 1759, at Ér-Semlyén, in the county of Bihar, Hungary. After passing through the gymnasium of Sâros-Patak, he studied law at Kassa and Eperies, and in Pest, where he also obtained a thorough knowledge of French and German literature, and made the acquaintance of Gideon Râday, who allowed him the use of his library, and encouraged him in literary pursuits. In 1784 Kazinczy became subnotary for the county of Abauj; and in 1786 he was nominated inspector of schools at Kassa. There he began to devote himself to the restoration of the Magyar language and literature by translations from classical foreign works, and by the augmentation of the native vocabulary from ancient Magyar sources. In 1788, with the assistance of Barôti Szabé and John Bacsânyi, he started at Kassa the first Magyar literary magazine, Magyar Muzeum ; the Orpheus, which succeeded it in 1790, was of his own creation. Although, upon the accession of Leopold II., Kazinczy, as a non-Catholic, was obliged to resign his post at Kassa, his literary activity in no way decreased, and he not only assisted Gideon Râday in the establishment and direction of the first Magyar dramatic society, but also enriched the repertoire with several translations from foreign authors. His Hamlet, which first appeared at Kassa in 1790, is a rendering from the German version of Schröder. Having become implicated in the democratic conspiracy of the abbot Martinovics, Kazinczy was arrested on the 14th December 1794, conveyed to Buda, tried, and condemned to death; but the sentence was commuted to imprisonment. He was released in 1801, and shortly afterwards married Sophia Török, daughter of his former patron, and retired to his small estate at Széphalom or “Fairhill,” near Sâtor-Ujhely, in the county of Zemplén. In 1828 he took an active part in the conferences held for the establishment of the Hungarian academy, in the historical section of which he became the first corresponding member. He died of Asiatic cholera, at Széphalom, on the 22d August 1831, in the seventy-second year of his age.

Kazinczy, although possessing great beauty of style, cannot be regarded as a powerful and original thinker; his fame is chiefly due to the felicity of his translations from the masterpieces of Lessing, Goethe, Wieland, Klopstock, Ossian, La Rochefoucauld, Marmontel, Molière, Metastasio, Shakespeare, Sterne, Cicero, Sallust, Anacreon, and many others. He also edited the works of Baroczy (Pest, 1812, 8 vols.) and of the poet Zrinyi (1817, 2 Vols.), and the poems of Dayka (1813, 3 vols.) and of John Kis (1815, 3 vols.). A collective edition of his works, consisting for the most part of translations, was published at Pest, 1814-1816, in 9 vols. His original productions, largely made up of letters, were edited by Joseph Bajza and Francis Toldy at Pest, 1836-45, in 5 vols. Editions of his poems appeared in 1858 and in 1863. See Hungary, vol. xii. p. 377.
