KHATMÁNDU, the capital of the kingdom of Nepâl, India, situated on the bank of the Vishnumati river at its junction with the Bâghmati, 27° 36' N. lat., 85° 24' E. long. The town, which is said to have been founded by Râjâ Gunakâmadeva about 723, now contains a population estimated at about 50,000, occupying 5000 houses made of brick, and usually from two to four stories high. Many of the houses have large projecting wooden windows or balconies, richly carved. The mahâràjâ’s palace, a huge, rambling, ungainly building, stands in the centre of the city, which also contains numerous handsome temples. The streets are extremely narrow, and the whole town very dirty. A British resident, with a small staff and escort, is stationed about a mile to the north of the city.
