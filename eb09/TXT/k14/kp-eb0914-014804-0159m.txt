KROLEVETZ, a district town of Russia, in the government of Tchernigoff, 108 miles east of the government town. Its 14,000 inhabitants live by agriculture and gardening, by linen manufactures, and by trading in agricultural produce and salted fish imported from the province of Ekaterinoslaff, and in manufactured wares.
