KINGSTON-ON-THAMES, a municipal borough and market-town of England, county of Surrey, extends for about a mile and a half along the right bank of the Thames, and is distant from London about 20 miles by the river and 12 miles by rail and road. The ancient wooden bridge over the river, which was in existence as early as 1224, was superseded by a structure of stone in 1827. The town is irregularly built, but its suburbs contain many fine houses and villas embosomed in trees, and of late years it has been rapidly increasing. Public walks and gardens have been constructed along the river. The parish church of All Saints, chiefly Perpendicular in style, contains several brasses of the 15th century; the grammar school, rebuilt in 1878, was originally founded as a chantry by Edward Lovekyn in 1305, and converted into a school by Queen Elizabeth. Near the parish church stood until 1779 the chapel of St Mary, where, it is alleged, the Saxon kings were crowned. The ancient stone said to have been used as a throne at these coronations was removed to the market-place in 1850. A town hall in the Italian style was erected in 1840, the former building having been a very ancient structure. There are several foundation schools and a large number of charities. The growth of the town has been owing chiefly to the increasing number of London business men who have made it their residence, its proximity to Richmond park and Hampton Court no doubt aiding its popularity. There are large market gardens in the neighbourhood, and the town possesses oil-mills, flour-mills, breweries, and brick and tile works. A little distance up the river are the works of several London water companies. An annual cattle fair is held in November, and county assizes are held at Lent. The population of the municipal borough in 1881 was 19,875.

Kingston doubtless derived its name from the fact that at an early period it was a royal demesne. On digging the foundation for the new bridge a large number of important Roman remains were discovered, and on this account many believe that it was at this spot that Caesar crossed the Thames when in pursuit of Cassivelaunus. In 838 it was the seat of a witenagemot convened [9:14:90] by King Egbert. From lidwin in 901 to Ethelred in 978 it was the place where the Anglo-Saxon kings were crowned. Kingston returned members to parliament from the 4th of Edward II. to the 47th of Edward III. It received a charter of incorporation from King John, which was confirmed and extended by several subsequent monarchs. In 1264 the castle of Kingston, no trace of which now remains, was taken by Henry III. In 1648 it was made the rendezvous of forces designed for the release of Charles I. from the Isle of Wight, but in the skirmish near the town the Royalists were defeated, and Lord Francis Villiers was killed.
