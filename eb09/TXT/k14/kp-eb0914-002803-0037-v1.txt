KEITH, Francis Edward James (1696-1758), generally known as Marshal Keith, son of William the ninth earl marischal (see last article), was the most notable member of the house of Keith. Through his careful education under Bishop Keith, and his subsequent university curriculum at Edinburgh in preparation for the legal profession, he acquired that taste for literature which afterwards secured him the esteem of the most distinguished savants of Europe; but at an early period his preference for a soldier’s career was decided and enthusiastic. The rebellion of 1715, in which he displayed qualities that gave some augury of his future eminence, compelled him to seek safety on the Continent. After spending two years in Paris, chiefly in studying at the university, he in 1719 took part in the ill-starred expedition of the Pretender to the Highlands of Scotland. He then passed some time at Paris and Madrid in obscurity and poverty, until he obtained the pay of a colonel from the king of Spain. Finding his Protestantism a barrier to promotion, he obtained from the king of Spain a recommendation to the emperor Peter II. of Russia, from whom he received the command of a regiment of the guards. In several Russian campaigns the calm, intelligent, and watchful valour which was his chief characteristic was displayed to such advantage that he obtained the rank of general and the reputation of being one of the ablest officers in the Russian service. Judging, however, that his rewards were not commensurate with his merits, he in 1747 offered his services to king Frederick of Prussia, who at once gave him the rank of field marshal, and gradually came to cherish towards him a strong personal affection and regard. In the subsequent wars of Frederick he displayed conspicuous ability, manifesting in critical contingencies a remarkable union of circumspection and promptitude. He was killed, 14th October 1758, at the battle of Hochkirch. Keith is described by Carlyle as “sagacious, skilful, imperturbable, without fear and without noise, a man quietly ever ready”; and also as “not given to talk unless there is something to be said, but well capable of it then.”
