KILLIZ, or Kilis, a town of Syria, in the Turkish vilayet of Aleppo, in 37° 2' N. lat. and 37° 2' E. long., 60 miles north of the city of Aleppo. It is situated in an extremely fertile plain or plateau, completely surrounded with olive groves, the produce of which is reckoned the finest oil of all Syria; and its position on the regular route from Birejik on the Euphrates to southern Caramania gives it considerable traffic. The bazaars are unusually fine, and gunmaking is a common craft in the town. The population, variously estimated at 12,000 and 6000, consists largely of Arabs, the town lying just on the northern rim of· the Arab territory.
