KREMSIER (in Czech, Krorneria), chief town of a district in Moravia, Austria, is situated in the fertile region of Hanna on the March, about 25 miles south-west of Olmütz. It is the seat of several local courts, and is the summer residence of the bishop of Olmütz, whose palace, surrounded by a fine park and gardens, and containing a picture gallery, library, and various collections, forms the chief object of interest. Kremsier has both a German and a Slav upper-gymnasium, a higher commercial school, a convent, and a hospital. Its industries include printing, and the manufacture of sugar, malt, and pottery. In 1870 the population was 9918.

In 1131 Kremsier was the seat of a bishopric. It suffered considerably during the Hussite war; and in 1643 it was taken and burned by the Swedes. After the rising of 1848, the Austrian congress met in the palace at Kremsier from November 1848 till March 1849.
