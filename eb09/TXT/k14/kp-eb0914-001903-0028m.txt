KAY, John (1742-1826), Scottish caricaturist, was born in April 1742, near Dalkeith, where his father was a mason. At thirteen he was apprenticed to a barber, whom he served for six years. He then went to Edinburgh, where in 1771 he obtained the freedom of the city by joining the corporation of barber-surgeons. For some years he practised his craft with success; but in 1785, induced by the favour which greeted certain attempts of his to etch in aquafortis, he took down his barber’s pole and opened a small print shop in Parliament Square. There he continued to flourish, painting miniatures, and publishing at short intervals his sketches and caricatures of local celebrities and oddities, who abounded at that period in Edinburgh society. He died on February 21, 1826. Kay’s portraits were collected b.y Hugh Paton and published under the title Λ Semes of Original Portraits and Caricature Etchings by the late John Kay, with Biographical Sketches and Illustrative Anecdotes (Edin., 2 vols. 4to, 1838; 8vo ed., 4 vols., 1842; new 4to ed., with additional plates, 2 vols., 1877), forming a unique record of the social life and popular habits of Edinburgh at its most interesting epoch. The caricatures have little strictly artistic merit, beyond their graphic power; the drawing is always stiff and often false; but they are admitted to have been accurate likenesses, and they possess the evident recommendation of abundant and sly humour.
