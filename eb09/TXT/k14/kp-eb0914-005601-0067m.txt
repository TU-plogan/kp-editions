KHABAROVKA, the chief town of the Maritime Province, in eastern Siberia, is situated on high crags, on the right bank of the Amoor, amidst wide forests and marshes, at the confluence of the Ussuri. It was but a poor settlement with 700 inhabitants when it took the place of Nikolaievsk as the seat of the military administration of the Maritime Province and of the various establishments connected with the Amoor fleet. Since its foundation in 1857 it has always been the chief centre for the trade in sables, purchased yearly from the aborigines to the average amount of 20,000 pieces, and sent to Irkutsk and to Russia.
