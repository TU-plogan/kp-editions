KORITSA, Goritsa, Geortcha, or Ghiorghia, a town of Albania, in the Turkish vilayet of Janina, situated in a spacious plain 45 miles east of Berat and 30 miles west of Kastoria. It is a place of about 10,000 inhabitants, containing a considerable number of well-built houses scattered among its cottages of unbaked mud. To its position on the route between the Adriatic and the Archipelago it is indebted for a flourishing trade. The metropolitan church is a large edifice richly adorned in the interior with paintings and statues.
