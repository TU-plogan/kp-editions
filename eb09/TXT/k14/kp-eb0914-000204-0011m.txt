KARAITES, or Caraites, a Jewish sect of the Middle Ages, claiming to be distinguished by adherence to Scripture as contrasted with oral tradition, whence the name (from K"∣p, as if “readers,” scripturarii·, sometimes also N∏ρo 'J5). They have frequently been identified with the Sadducees or with the Samaritans, with neither of whom have they any historical connexion or much spiritual affinity. The schism arose at Baghdad about the middle of the 8th century, when the hereditary claims of Anan, a learned Talmudist, to the office of Resh Galutha were set aside by the Gaonim or heads of rabbinical schools at Sura and Pumbeditha because he was believed to undervalue the authority of the Talmud. An appeal by Anan to the caliph proved unsuccessful, and he appears even to have been. imprisoned for some time; but ultimately he was permitted to migrate along with his followers to Palestine, where they erected in Jerusalem a synagogue which continued to be maintained until the time of the crusades. From this centre the sect diffused itself thinly over Syria, spread into Egypt, and ultimately reached south-eastern Europe. Anan, who is said to have died in 765 a,d., was the author of a commentary on the Pentateuch and other works in Talmudic Hebrew and Arabic,—all of which unfortunately are lost; for our knowledge of the distinctive principles maintained by him we are thus left entirely dependent on the hostile indications of opponents. In general we know that he showed great bitterness against the Talmud and its upholders (the “Rabbanites ”) for their falsification of the written law by arbitrary additions and subtractions, but there is nothing to indicate that he himself had the insight or the fervour by which he could have become the pioneer of any really great reformation in religion or morals. The questions in dispute appear to have turned entirely on points of very minute detail. Several of them related to the regulation of the calendar, the new moon, for example, being fixed by the Karaites by direct observation, not by astronomical calculation, and the intercalary year also being determined empirically; others related to paschal and pentecostal ritual, such as the precise hour for killing the lamb or for burning its remains. The differences which affected social life most deeply were those relating to Sabbath observance and the forbidden degrees of marriage, the Karaites not recognizing any distinction between relationships of consanguinity and those of affinity, while in their zeal to avoid all risk of infringement of the sacredness of the day of rest they prohibited the burning of any light at all in their houses from sunset to sunset. Little information as to the Karaites can be derived from their liturgies, which are comparatively modern; though differing from those used by the Rabbinical Jews, they are not characterized by any marked divergence in principle. The controversies as to the rule of faith which so deeply divided the Christian church in the 16th century gave to this obscure sect an illusory and passing importance, the Catholics frequently hurling the epithet Karaei, in token of contempt, at the Protestants, who in their turn willingly accepted it as sufficiently descriptive of their attitude towards Scripture. The Karaites never have been numerous; the present community in Jerusalem numbers only about ten families. They occur in Constantinople and elsewhere in Turkey, but are chiefly met with in southern Russia, and especially in the Crimea, where in 1874 they numbered some 6000, chiefly in Eupatoria, Theodosia, and Sebastopol. In the Crimea their historical capital and chief synagogue was formerly the “Jews’Castle” (Tshufut-Kale), near Bakhchisarai. The place is now deserted; its cemetery was the seat of Firkowitsch’s notorious forgeries (inscriptions of 1st century), by which he sought to establish a fabulous antiquity for his sect. According to Strack (A. Firkowitsch u. seine Entdeckungen, 1876) the oldest tombstones do not go back beyond the 14th century. The modern Karaites are generally well spoken of for their honesty, perseverance, and simple habits of life; but their enslavement to tradition is quite as complete as that of any Talmudist could possibly be.
