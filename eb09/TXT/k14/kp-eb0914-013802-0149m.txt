KOMORN, or Comorn (Hungarian, liév-Komârom), a royal free town of Hungary, and capital of the trans-Danubian county of Komârom, lies at the eastern extremity of the island of Csallököz or Schütt, and at the Confluence of the Waag with the Danube, 48 miles west-north-west from Budapest, with which city as also with Vienna it is directly connected by railway, in 47° 46' N. lat., 18° 7' E. long. Komorn is celebrated chiefly for its fortifications, which, owing to their favourable position and extended line of tôtes-de-pont, are believed to be impregnable, and are capable of holding a force of some 30,000 defenders. The town is the seat of the county administration, and of a royal court of law, and has Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, a Jewish synagogue, Roman Catholic and Protestant gymnasia, county and town halls, a military hospital, two savings banks, and a shipping agency. The streets are for the most part narrow, irregular, and gloomy. The commercial relations of Komorn with the chief towns on the Danube are facilitated by its important steam-packet station. The inhabitants carry on a brisk trade in grain, timber, wine, flour, and fish. The civil population at the end of 1880 amounted to 13,108, mostly Magyars and Germans by nationality.

The walls of the fortifications of Komorn were commenced from the land side in 1272. They were much strengthened and extended two hundred years later by King Matthias (Corvinus). The new fort was begun by Ferdinand I. about 1547, and received additions in 1673 under Leopold I. In 1543, 1594, 1598, and 1663 Komorn was beleaguered by the Turks. It was raised to the dignity of a royal free town in 1751. In 1767, 1768, September 1848, and April 1854 it suffered severely from fire, and in 1763, 1822, and 1851 from earthquakes. The fortifications, having been neglected during the latter half of the 18th century, were enlarged and to a great extent reconstructed between 1805 and 1809. During the revolutionary war of 1848-49 Komorn was a principal point of military operations, and was long unsuccessfully besieged by the Austrians, who on the 11th July 1849 were defeated there by General Gorgei, and on the 3d August by General Klapka. On the 27th September the fortress capitulated to the Austrians upon honourable terms, and on the 3d and 4th October was evacuated by the Hungarian troops. The treasure of the Austrian national bank was removed here from Vienna in 1866, when that city was threatened by the Prussians.
