KOHL, Johann Georg (1808-1878), traveller and author, was born at Bremen, April 28, 1808. He studied law at Göttingen, Heidelberg, and Munich, and for six years was a private tutor in Courland, In 1838, after travelling through parts of Russia, he settled at Dresden. The success of four books, which he published in 1841, describing his Russian experiences, decided his choice of literature as a profession. Travels in Europe and America supplied ample material, and book after book appeared. In 1854 he undertook to prepare an historical coast survey of the United States, in the service of Government. In 1858 he returned to Bremen, where in 1863 he was made city librarian. In that post he died, October 28, 1878.

Kohl was a prolific author, and his books, both in the original and in English translations, have enjoyed considerable popularity. His style is agreeable and lively, and not without humour; his observation was acute, and not more superficial than was inevitable from the mode in which he amassed his materials.

(1851), the Danube (1854), Canada and New England (1857), the north-west of the Unite! States (1859), Lake Superior (“Kitchi-Gami ”) (1859). Among his historical, geographical, and miscellaneous Writings are the following:— Der Rhein, 2 vols., 1851; Aus meinen Hütten,
