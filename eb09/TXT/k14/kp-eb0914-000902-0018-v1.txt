KÂSHKÂR, also called Chitrâl, from the residence of the prince, a high-lying Mohammedan state among the spurs of Hindu Kush, has been already spoken of under Hindu Kush (vol. xi. p. 838). Since that was published, a work [Tribes of the Hindoo Koosh, Calcutta, 1880) has come from the pen of Major Biddulph, the only European known to have visited the state, and we here enter a very few corrections or new particulars from his work. The geographical position of Kâshkâr is likely to give it great interest in the future. A considerable part of Upper Kâshkâr belongs to Yassin, in the Gilgit basin (see Gilgit, vol X. p. 597). Indeed the left bank of the Chitrâl river, down to within 20 miles of Chitrâl itself, belongs to Yassin. The chief place of this Upper Kâshkâr is Mastûj (vol. X. p. 596). The rulers of the two states are of the same blood, sprung from a Khorâsâni adventurer who immigrated hither about the first half of the 17th century, aud are respectively descended from two brothers of his family, Shâh Katôr and Shah Khûshwakt, who lived a century later. The two royal families are hence known as Katoré and Khûshwaktê respectively; they generally act in concert, though neither is dependent on the other. We know not the origin of the former name, but most probably it is connected with an ancient tribal name in Kâfiristân {q.v.). The ruler of Chitrâl is known both as Mihtar, or “Prince,” and by the pretentious title of Badshcιh. He has five viziers, of whom the chief, or Dewân-begi, has charge of the king’s slave-agency, an important part of the reigning system. Under this the rulers of Chitrâl have come to regard the sale of their subjects as a legitimate and ordinary supplement to tlιeir revenue. But of late the market has become circumscribed. The population of the kingdom is estimated at 200,000, not including the tributary tribe of Bashgali Kafirs, who occupy a nearly parallel valley on the west, confluent with that of Kâshkâr. The ethnology of Kâshkâr is very intricate. The largest, and probably aboriginal, population are called Kho. Their language, Khowâr, is closely allied to the dialects of the Kafir tribes. There are also tribes in a depressed position, immigrants from the other side of the watershed, and speaking the language of Munjân, a hill canton of the Oxus valley, calling themselves Yidghâh. In the lower part of the valley is a race, also with a peculiar language, called Gabar (mentioned by Sultan Baber), and some broken tribes of Siâhposh, <Lc. All these constitute the lower or ryot class, who alone pay regular revenue, cannot hold slaves, and are styled fakir mushkin (“poor beggars ”). Above them are several privileged classes, descended from the founders of the reigning family, or from older ruling families also of foreign blood. We may add that Chitrâl is identical with the Shang-mi of Hwen Tsang (644 ad ), see .7. R. Λs. Soc., new ser., vol. vi. p. 114. A somewhat later Chinese record gives, as an alternative name of Shang-mi, Khiu-wei, which evidently contains the Kh > just mentioned. In this Kho also we have probably an element of Choaspes, the Greek name of the Chitrâl river. A singular point in Chitrâl history is the fact that it was invaded by a Chinese army about the middle of last century, probably in 1759-60, and continued to send occasional tribute to China at least to 1769, t>., twelve years after the battle of Plassy. This was brought to notice by the present writer in 1872 («7. R. G. S., xlii. 477), when tracing the curious history of the name Bolor. And now Major Biddulph has found in the country itself the memory of the Chinese invasion, and thus entire corroboration of the identification of the Chinese Poloeul or Bυlor with Kâshkâr. (h. y.)
