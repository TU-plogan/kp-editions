KUM, a walled city of Persia, in the province of Trak-Adjemi, in a hilly district at the western edge of the Great Salt Desert, 85 miles south of Teheran on the main route to Ispahan, and at the northern extremity of the lofty Kuru-Kuh range, which runs thence for over COO miles south-east to the Bam highlands. It is a long, straggling, half-ruined place, with empty bazaars, and neglected streets full of holes and pitfalls. Yet it ranks second to Meshhed in sanctity, thanks to the famous shrine of Masuma Fatima, sister of the imâm Riza, which also contains the remains of ten kings and four hundred and forty-four “saints,” and whose gilded copper dome has been completed by the present shah. Like Kerbela, Kum is a favourite place of interment for the faithful, and is yearly visited by thousands of devout Shiah pilgrims. At one time it is said to have contained 100,000 inhabitants, and its former greatness is still attested by the surrounding ruins, of which Sir Thomas Herbert quaintly remarks that they “may gaine beliefe to the inhabitants, who say it was once comparable in pride and greatness to mightie Babylon.” Even in that traveller’s time it was still a flourishing place, with well-built houses “sweet and wel-furnished, her streets wide, her bazzar faire and her mosque of most honourable esteem.” But the neighbourhood now presents the aspect of a vast necropolis, while not more than 4000 of its 20,000 houses are occupied. Cotton of good quality and the castor-oil plant are extensively cultivated in the district, which is watered by the Gonsir and a few other intermittent streams draining east to the great desert. Population estimated at 20,000.
