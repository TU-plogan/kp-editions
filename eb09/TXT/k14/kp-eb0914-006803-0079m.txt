KHÚZISTAN, a province of West Persia, bounded N. and N.E. by Luristan, S.E. by Fars, S. by the Persian Gulf, W. by Turkey, lies mainly within 30°-33° N. lat. and 47 °- 51° E. long., stretching about 200 miles north and south, with a. mean breadth of 80 to 100 miles, and an area of 25,677 square miles. In the south is the rich alluvial lowland tract of Arabistan, “the most extensive and fertile plain in Persia.” Elsewhere the surface is very mountainous, being traversed by tho lofty Bakhtiari ranges, which form a south-eastern continuation of the Pαsht-i-Koh highlands, and which preserve a remarkable parallelism throughout their entire length, while increasing in elevation from 8000 to 16,000 feet as they advance inland to the Kuh-Dinâr. They are broken by several deep and romantic gorges, through which the Karkhah, Kanin, Jarahi, and Tab rivers escape to the Euphrates delta or to the coast, watering several fertile upland valleys on their winding course seawards. The climate on the coast is excessively hot, and in some low-lying swampy districts very unhealthy; in the highlands severe winters and hot summers are followed by genial springs and autumns; the prevailing winds are north-west and south-east, the latter bearing much moisture from the Indian Ocean. The lowlands take the name of Arabistan from the Arabs, who form the bulk of their population. Many of the Ka'b Arabs have been assimilated in speech and religion to the Persians; but most of the great Beni-Lâm nation, comprising in Khùzistân and Baghdad 17 branches, 85 septs, and 30,000 families, are still in the nomad state. The highlands are mainly occupied by the Feili, Bakhtiari, Kohgelu, Mamaseni, and other Luri tribes of Kurd stock and speech, also nomads and addicted to brigandage. The staples of food are dates and fish in the south, elsewhere the produce of the herds and flocks. The chief products are rice, tobacco, cotton, indigo, silk, maize, barley; the trade is mainly with Baghdad and Bussorah. The manufactures include coarse woollens, cottons, tents, red cloth. Dyeing is extensively carried on in Dizful, which, besides Shaster and Mohammrah, is the only place worthy the name of town.

Khùzistân is the Biblical Elam (^.v.), the classical Susiana. The name appears in the great inscription of Darius as Uvaja, corresponding to, the Uxii of classical writers. The transition to the modern Khιiz, Khιizistan, appears in the name Beth Khûzâyë, used by Syriac writers of the Sassanian period.
