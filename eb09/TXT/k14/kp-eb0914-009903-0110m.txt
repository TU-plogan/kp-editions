KIRK-KILISSIA, or Kirk-Kilisseh, a town in the vilayet of Adrianople, Turkey, is situated on a feeder of the Erkene, which is an affluent of the Maritza, about 35 miles east of Adrianople. It has its chief importance from its position at the southern outlet of the Fakhi defile over the Strandja mountains, through which passes the shortest road from Shumla to Constantinople. It contains six mosques, several Greek churches, and a large bazaar. A special kind of confection is made at Kirk-Kilissia; and a considerable quantity of butter and cheese is sent thence to Constantinople. The population is estimated at about 16,000.
