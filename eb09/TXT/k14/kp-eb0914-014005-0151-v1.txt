KORDOFAN, a province of the Egyptian Sudan, which, though marked off from the surrounding territory by no very definite confines, may be said to lie between 12° and 16° N. lat. and between 29° 30' and 32° 30' E. long. On the east it does not reach the Nile, and on the west it is usually held to be separated from Darfur by a neutral strip of country. It consists for the most part of a rolling steppe in which a hill of 50 feet is a landmark for a day’s journey; but towards the west there are a few isolated peaks such as Jebel Abu Senun and Jebel Kordofan, which rise to a height of 150 to 800 feet above the plain, and in the north-west there are two considerable groups, Jebel Katul and Jebel Kagga. The general elevation of the country above sea-level is given as from 1410 to 1840 feet. A granitic sand with abundance of mica and felspar forms the upper stratum throughout the greater part of the area; but an admixture of clay, which is observable in the north, becomes strongly marked in the south, where there are also stretches of black vegetable mould. Beneath there appears to unfold itself an unbroken surface of mica schist. River or stream there is really none, though a few temporary watercourses or khhrs exist in the rainy season; and the only permanent lakes are El Birkeh, El Rahad, and Shirkeleh, which are formed by the great Khor Abu Hable in the south. During the rainy season the water collects in myriads of little depressions, but owing partly to rapid evaporation and partly to the porous character of the soil the surface of the country is soon as dry as before. The water which has found its way through the granitic sand flows over the surface of the mica schist and settles in the hollows. Wells consequently sunk so as to reach the solid rock obtain a supply of water more or less abundant according to the spot which they happen to strike; and it is the existence of these which renders human life possible in Kordofan. It is estimated that (apart from those in a few areas of depression—Cagmar, Abu Haraze, Bara, and Mulbes—where the sand stratum is very thin and water is reached at the depth of a few feet) there are about 900 of these wells. They are narrow shafts going down from 75 to 150 or 200 feet, and supported “from the bottom to a little above the water-level” by the long roots of the mimosa, wound round so as to form a complete casing. The water ⅛ raised by rope and bucket at the cost of enormous labour, and none is available for irrigation. The very cattle are trained to go a long time without drinking. Entire villages migrate after harvest to the neighbourhood of some plentiful well; and in El Obeyd water becomes a regular article of trade soon after the close of the rains. As there is no highland area draining into Kordofan, the underground reservoirs are dependent on the local rainfall, and a large number of the wells are dry during many months. The rainy season lasts from June to September, rain falling every three or four days in brief but violent showers. The wind during that period is from the south or southwest; the air is extremely oppressive; and fevers prevail among the foreign residents. In September the north winds begin to take their turn, and from the middle of October they blow steadily throughout the winter, and produce what Europeans consider a delightful climate. With March begins the dry and sultry summer. The settled population of Kordofan is estimated at 164,740, the nomadic at 114,000. The former, who are scattered over the country in about eight hundred and sixty villages, are of very mingled blood, especially in the neighbourhood of the capital, but the Ghodiat, Gilledat, and Gowanieh appear to be the original stock. Of the nomadic tribes the most noteworthy are the Hasanieh, the Kababish, and the Bagara. The last-mentioned—who roam about the southern parts of the country—are a dark red-bronze race remarkable for their magnificent physique. The staple crop in Kordofan is the dokhn or Penicillaria typhoides. Eaten both uncooked and in various culinary conditions, it forms the main food of nine-tenths of the population, and [9:14:141] furnishes the raw material for the sweetish Kordofan beer or merissa. Cattle are largely bred by the Bagara, and camels by the Kababish; aud horses, goats, donkeys, and sheep are kept in small numbers. Since the ostrich has been almost hunted out of the country the chief article of importance for trade is the gum yielded by the many mimosa trees, which along with the hijlij, the tamarisk, and the talh tend to relieve the monotony of the steppe. Salt and iron ore exist within the province, but they have not become of any practical value.

Of the movements by which the present composite ethnology of Kordofan was attained little record is recoverable. In 1790 Sheikh Nasib of Sennaar subjugated the district; and under his rule the inhabitants prospered. But, piqued by his neighbour’s success, Ibn Fadhl of Darfur invaded Kordofan with a powerful army numbering no less than 12,000 or 14,000 camels, and completely defeated the Sennaar governor Melek il Hashma. The Darfur supremacy continued till 1821 when Mohammed Aly undertook the conquest of Nubia and Sennaar. The defterdar, Mohammed Aly’s son-in-law, subjugated Kordofan, and continued to rule it with worse than a rod of iron till he was recalled on account of his cruelties.

G. Prout, General Report on Province of Kordofan, Cairo, 1877; Marno, Reise in der egypt. Equat. Provinz, Yienna, 1879. 'lhe Italian travellers Matteucci and Massari traversed Kordofan in 1880, in their great journey across the continent. The geographical nomenclature is still in many cases uncertain.
