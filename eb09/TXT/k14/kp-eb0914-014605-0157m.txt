KRANTZ, or Crantz, Albert (c. 1450-1517), German historian, was a native of Hamburg. He studied law, theology, and history at Rostock and Cologne, and after travelling through western and southern Europe was appointed professor, first of philosophy and subsequently of theology, in the university of Rostock, of which he was rector in 1482. In 1492 he returned to Hamburg as theological lecturer, canon, and prebendary in the cathedral. By the senate of Hamburg he was employed on more than one diplomatic mission abroad, and in 1500 he was chosen by the king of Denmark and the duke of Holstein as arbiter in their dispute regarding the province of Dithmarschen. As dean of the cathedral chapter, to which office he was appointed in 1508, Krantz applied himself with zeal to the reform of ecclesiastical abuses, but, though opposed to [9:14:147] various corruptions connected with church discipline, he had little sympathy with the drastic measures of Wickliffe or Huss. A deathbed utterance of his, somewhat desponding in its tone, with reference to Luther and his ninety-five theses has occasionally, but unfairly, been interpreted as a summary condemnation of that Reformer. Krantz died December 7, 1517.

Krantz was the author of a number of historical works which for the period when they were written are characterized by exceptional impartiality and research. The principal of these are Chronicon regnorum aquilonarium Daniae, Sueciae, et Norvegiae, Strasburg, 1545; Vandalia, sive historia de Vandalorum vera origine, &c., Cologne, 1519; Saxonia, 1520; and Metropolis sive Historia ecclesiae in Saxonia, 1548.
