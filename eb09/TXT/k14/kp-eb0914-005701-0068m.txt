KHANDPÁRA, a petty state in Orissa, India, lying between 20° 1Γ and 20° 25' N. lat,, and 85° 1' and 85° 25' E. long., with an area of 244 square miles, and a population in 1872 of 60,877, mostly Hindus. Khandpâra originally formed a part of the neighbouring state of Nayâgarh, and was separated from it about two hundred years ago by a brother of the Nayâgarh râjâ,, who established his independence. The present chief, a Râjput by caste, is the eighth in descent from the founder. The country forms a very valuable territory, and is one of the best cultivated of the Orissa states. Fine sal timber abounds in the hilly parts, and magnificent banian and mango trees stud the plain. It is intersected by the Kuaria and Dauka rivers, small tributaries of the Mahânadi. The estimated annual revenue of the chief is £2258; tribute to the British government, £421.
