KINGSTON, the chief city of Frontenac county, Ontario, Canada, is situated at the north-eastern extremity of Lake Ontario, at the point where the St Lawrence issues from it, and at the mouth of the Cataraqui Creek, about 160 miles east of Toronto by the Grand Trunk Railway. Of the many fine buildings the chief are the city-hall, the market, the custom-house, the court-house and jail, the post-office, and the university. Among the charities are a hospital, an orphanage, a combined hospital and orphanage, a house of industry, and a house of refuge. The penitentiary and the lunatic asylum are at a little distance from the city. Kingston is the seat of Queen’s university and college, and of a medical college affiliated to the university. The Roman Catholic Regiopolis college has been closed since 1869. The royal military college of the Dominion is at Kingston. The harbour is deep, spacious, and sheltered, and brisk trade is carried on. As a naval station Kingston occupies an important position. It commands the entrance to the Rideau Canal, and is strongly fortified. Shipbuilding, iron-founding, and the manufacture of locomotives, steam-engines, and machinery, leather, soap and candles, boots and shoes, cotton, and wooden goods are carried on by the inhabitants. Kingston is the seat of an Anglican and of a Roman Catholic bishop. The population in 1881 was 14,093.

Kingston occupies the site of the old French fort Frontenac. It received its present name after it was taken by the British in 1762. For three years (1841-44) it was the capital of Canada.
