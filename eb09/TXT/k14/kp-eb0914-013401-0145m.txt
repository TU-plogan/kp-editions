KNOXVILLE, chief city of Knox county and of East Tennessee, United States, is situated on the right bank of the Tennessee river, which is navigable up to this point, four miles below the confluence of the Holston and French Broad rivers, and about 165 miles east of Nashville. By recent statistics it is shown to be one of the six healthiest cities in the United States; the elevation is 1000 feet, mean temperature 58° Fahr., average rainfall 54 ’ 5 inches. Among its numerous handsome buildings are the United States custom-house and post-office, the university of Tennessee, and the public schools. There is a free library in the city. The university, which includes the State college of agriculture and the mechanic arts, was founded in 1807, the latter departments being added in 1869. It has a good library, and geological, mineralogical, and zoological collections. In 1881 there were 398 students. Knoxville is a busy industrial and commercial centre. Its manufactures include iron in all its forms, railway and other carriages, paper, furniture, sashes and blinds, tobacco, flour, leather and harness, pottery, &c.; and it has a brisk trade in these articles, as well as in boots and shoes, hardware, and drygoods. Marble and coal of excellent quality are found in vast quantities near the city. Knoxville was settled in 1789, and laid out as a town in 1791, when it was named after General Henry Knox, at that time Washington’s minister of war. From 1794 till 1817 it was the capital of Tennessee. During the civil war it was an important position, passing into the possession of the Union forces in 1863. The population of the city in 1880 was 9693, or, including directly connected suburbs, 15,450.
