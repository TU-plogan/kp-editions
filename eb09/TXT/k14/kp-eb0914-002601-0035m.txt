KECSKEMÉT (Lat. Egopolis), a royal free town in the county of Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kis-Kun, Hungary, is situated in au extensive plain, on the railway between Szeged (Szegedin) and Budapest, 52 miles south-east of the latter, in 46° 54' N. lat., 19° 44' E. long. Kecskemét is a poorly built and straggling town. It contains Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as also a synagogue. Among the educational and other establishments are a Calvinist upper gymnasium (since 1860) and juridical lyceum (1862), possessing a library and collection of pictures, a Roman Catholic (Piarist) upper gymnasium, founded in 1714, a Government technical school dating from 1874, monasteries belonging to the Piarist and Franciscan orders, a royal court of law, a hospital, orphan asylum, and theatre. The soil of the surrounding district, known as the Kecskemét heath, though generally arenaceous, is rendered productive by careful tillage. Soap is manufactured; and trade, promoted by the periodical fairs, is generally thriving. Joseph Katona, the author of the famous historical drama Bank Ban, was born at Kecskemét in 1792. The population in 1880 was 46,505, chiefly Magyars by nationality.
