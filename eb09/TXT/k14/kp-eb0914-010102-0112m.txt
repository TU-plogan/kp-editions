KÍSH, or Kais (the first form is Persian and the second Arabic), an island in the Persian Gulf, which rose to importance in the 12th and 13th centuries, and flourished on the fall of Sïrâf as a chief station of the Indian trade with the West. Edrisi in the 12th century describes it as the capital of a pirate chief who had acquired great wealth and power, and ravaged the coasts far and wide. He also drew a tribute from the pearl fisheries of the gulf. In the folio wing century Yâküt describes it from personal observation as a beautiful and flourishing island, the seat of the lord of Omân, sovereign of those seas, and the station for ships trading between India and Fârsistân. The lord of Kish was respected even in India for his wealth and maritime power. According to Ibn el Athir he was at constant war with the sovereign of Hormuz, and the rise of the latter port seems to have been fatal to the importance of Kish (Ibn Batuta, i. 244, and note in Paris edition; Kazwini, ed. Wüstenf., il 161). The island is generally identified with the modern Kenn and the Kataia of Arrian. See Vincent, Voyage de Nearque ; Ouseley’s Travels, i. 169 sq.
