KETCHUP, a sauce or relish prepared principally from the juice of mushrooms and of many other species of edible fungi, salted for preservation and variously spiced. The term ketchup, written also catsup and katchup, is said to be of Japanese origin. The following may be taken as a typical example of the ingredients and method of preparation of ordinary ketchup. Freshly gathered mushrooms are placed in a wooden vessel and sprinkled with salt. They are left for two or three days, during which time they are repeatedly stirred and turned over. The juice is then squeezed out, and to every gallon of the juice there is added of crushed cloves and mustard seed half an ounce each, and of black pepper, ginger, and allspice each an ounce. The mixture is boiled gently, decanted, and left to macerate , for about two weeks, after which it is strained off and bottled. Should it show any tendency to putrefaction it is again boiled with the addition of salt and spices. It is of the utmost consequence to avoid copper, lead, and pewter vessels or implements in the preparation of ketchup; as far as possible glazed earthenware vessels alone should be used. The juices of various fruits, such as cucumbers, tomatoes, and especially green walnuts, are used as a basis of ketchup, and shell-fish ketchup, from oysters, mussels, and cockles, is also made; but in general the term is restricted to sauces having the juice of edible fungi as their basis.
