KIRMÁNSHÁHÁN, or Kermanshah (Arabic, lfar-misin), a town and district of west Persia, lying between Ardelân and Lûristân north and south. The town is the chief place in what is known as Persian Kûrdistân, an expression, however, which has no administrative significance. It lies in 34° 18' N. lat. and 46° 37' E. long., on a rising ground connected with the Zagros hills, which stretch south-eastwards to the Bakhtiari range. Here it occupies an important strategical position near the right bank of the river Kernah, 250 miles south-west of Tehrân, 262 north-west of Ispahân, 220 north-east of Baghdad, and 280 south of Tabriz. Although surrounded by fortifications with five gates and 3 miles in circuit, it is now practically an open town, for the walls are in ruins and the moat choked with rubbish. During Muhammad Ali Mirza’s administration it was a very flourishing place, with a population of 35,000 and a large local and transit trade between Baghdad and Tehrân. Since then it has suffered more than most towns in Persia from misgovernment, under which its few buildings have gone to decay, its bazaars have become empty, and its trade reduced to a local traffic in the excellent fruits produced in the surrounding gardens and orchards. The rich and beautiful carpets and rugs for which it was formerly noted are no longer to be had, and the population has fallen to about 12,000, exclusive of a garrison of 5000 usually maintained at this important frontier station.

Kirmánsháhán is governed by a royal prince, with jurisdiction over the district, which occupies an extensive tract between Mount Elwend and the Turkish border. Here the plains are well watered and very fertile, while the hills are covered with rich pastures which support large flocks of sheep and goats, besides horses of a good breed crossed with Arab blood. About 70,000 sheep are yearly taken to Tehrân by the Kùrd shepherds, who form the vast majority of the inhabitants of the district, residing some in houses some in tents, and numbering altogether about 180,000.
