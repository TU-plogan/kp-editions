KENSINGTON, a western suburb of London in the parish of Kensington, parliamentary borough of Chelsea, and county of Middlesex, a mile and a half west of Hyde Park Corner. The parish includes the suburbs of Brompton, Earl’s Court, part of Little Chelsea, the Gravel Pits, Notting Hill, and part of Kensal Green. Kensington palace and Kensington gardens, however, lie in the parish of St Margaret’s, Westminster. The suburb of Kensington, which has developed out of the village of Kensington, lies to the west of Kensington gardens, and consists principally of a long and in places narrow street, the modern improvements of which with the surrounding additions have almost entirely obliterated all traces of the “old court suburb” associated with the distinguished personages of former times. From the High street others branch off at intervals, and the elevated ground to the north is almost wholly occupied with villas embosomed in woods. To the south of the High street is Kensington square, where at one time were the residences of many of the principal attendants on the court. The principal public buildings in the suburb are the parish church in the Decorated style, erected in 1869 at a cost of £35,000, the elegant new town-hall, the vestry hall, the grammar school, the Roman Catholic college, opened in 1874, several monasteries and convents, and various schools and charities. The site of Old Gore House, at one time the residence of Mr Wilberforce and afterwards of the Countess of Blessington, is now occupied by the Royal Albert Hall and the gardens of the Horticultural Society. These as well as Kensington gardens and the South Kensington museum with its national training schools fall to be noticed under the article London. Kensington palace, a plain and irregular brick structure, originally surrounded by grounds extending to about 350 acres, was at one time the residence of Lord Chancellor Finch, afterwards earl of Nottingham, of whom it was bought by William HI. Additions were made to it by William HL, George I., George II., and the duke of Sussex. The palace was the birthplace of Queen Victoria. Kensington house, which stood near the palace gate, and was at one time the residence of the duchess of Portsmouth, mistress of Charles II., was pulled down in 1873 to make way for the mansion of Baron Albert Grant The population of the registration subdistrict in 1871 was 91,664, which in 1881 had increased to 120,125. The population of the parish in 1881 was 162,924.

The manor of Kensington, which is written in Domesday book Chenesitun, has an area of 1140 acres. Some trace the origin of the word to the old Saxon name for king, others to a family of the name of Chenesi, others to “Caen,” the old name for wood. The manor was originally occupied by the great Middlesex forest, the trees of which were abundant in the time of Henry VIII. In Domesday it is mentioned as being held by Aubrey de Vere of the bishop of Coutances. Soon after this it became the absolute property of the De Veres, who were afterwards created earls of Oxford. In the reign of Elizabeth it passed into the possession of the Argylls, by whom it was sold to Sir Walter Cope, whose daughter married Henry Rich, earl of Holland. Holland House, in the Elizabethan style, the original mansion of the manor of Kensington, was erected by Sir Walter Cope in 1697, and enlarged and adorned by the third Lord Holland (see vol. xii. p. 100). The manor is at present held by Lord Kensington. See Faulkner, History and Antiquities of Kensington, 1820; Leigh Hunt, The Old Court Suburb.
