KESZTHELY, a market-town in the trans-Danubian county of Zala, Hungary, is picturesquely situated near the western extremity of Lake Balaton, about 97 miles south of Pozsony (Pressburg), in 46° 47' N. lat., 17° 15' E. long. Keszthely is chiefly noted for its well-organized agricultural institute, founded by Count George Festetics, and known as the “Georgicon.” At the source of the

Héviz brook there is a warm sulphur spring. The trade is principally in grain, fruit, and wine. The population at the end of 1880 was 5341, mostly Magyars by nationality, and Roman Catholics by creed.
