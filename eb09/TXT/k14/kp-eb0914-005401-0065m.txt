KESWICK, a market-town of Cumberland, is situated on the left bank of the Greta, close to Derwentwater or Keswick Lake, about 30 miles south of Carlisle, and 300 miles from London by rail. It is one of the centres for visitors to the Cumberland lakes, and is the point whence the ascent of Skiddaw is usually begun. In the parish church of Crosthwaite, three quarters of a mile off, there is a monument to the poet Southey, whose residence for many years, Greta Hall, stands at the end of the main street, close by the river. Keswick was formerly noted for its manufacture of lead pencils; and the plumbago (locally wad) used to be supplied by the mines in Borrowdale. Lead is still found in the neighbouring hills. Char, caught in the neighbouring lakes, are potted at Keswick in large quantities during the season, and sent to all parts of England. The population in 1881 was 3220.
