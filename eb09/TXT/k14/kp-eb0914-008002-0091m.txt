KING, William (1650-1729), a political and religious writer, and successively bishop of Derry and archbishop of Dublin, was born at Antrim in 1650. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and after being presented to the parish of St Werburgh, Dublin, in 1679, was elected dean of St Patrickâ€™s, Dublin, in 1688, bishop of Derry in 1691, and archbishop of Dublin in 1702. He died in 1729. King was the author of The State of the Protestants in Ireland under King James's Government, 1691, but is best known by his De Origine Mali, 1702 (English translation, 1731), an endeavour to reconcile the presence of evil with the existence and goodness of an Omnipotent Being, which was deemed worthy of a reply by Bayle and Leibnitz. He also published a sermon entitled Divine Predestination and Foreknowledge consistent with the Freedom of Man's Will, 1709, and various other small treatises.
