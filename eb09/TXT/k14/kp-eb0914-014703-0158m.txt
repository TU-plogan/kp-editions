KREMENTCHUG, a Russian town in the government of Poltava, situated 7 4 miles by rail to the southwest of the government town, on the railway between Kharkoff and Nicolaieff, and on the left bank (here flat and sandy) of the Dnieper. It is supposed to have been founded in 1571; by its situation at the southern terminus of the navigable course of the Dnieper, and on the highway from Moscow to Odessa, it early acquired a great commercial importance, which it still retains; by 1655 it was a wealthy town. In 1765 it became capital of “New Russia.” It now has a suburb, Kryukoff, on the right bank of the Dnieper, united with the town by a railway bridge. Nearly all commercial transactions in salt with White Russia are effected at Krementchug, the salt being deposited in large storehouses in Kryukoff, and then sent by boat to the north-west. The town is also a centre of the tallow trade with Warsaw; considerable quantities of timber, too, are floated down to this place and thence sent to the neighbouring provinces. Nearly all the trade in the brandy manufactured in the government of Kharkoff and destined for the governments of Ekaterinoslaff and Taurida is concentrated here, as also is the trade in linseed between the districts situated on the left affluents of the Dnieper and the southern ports. Other articles of commerce are r y e , rye-flour, wheat, oats, and sarrasine, which are sent, partly up the Dnieper to Pinsk, partly by land to Odessa and Berιslaff, but principally to Ekaterinoslaff, on light boats floated down during the spring floods. Although thus busily employed, the town does not wear the aspect of a commercial place, the linseed being mostly warehoused in the houses of the Jews who carry on this trade, and the important banking operations being also chiefly in the hands of Jews. The Dnieper is crossed at Krementchug by a remarkable tubular bridge 1081 yards long, over which passes the railway from Kharkoff to Balta; there is also a bridge of boats. The manufactures consist of carriages, agricultural machinery, and tobacco. Population, 31,000.
