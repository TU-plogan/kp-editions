KRUSENSTERN, Adam John (1770-1846), Russian navigator, hydrographer, and admiral, was born in Esthonia on November 8, 1770. In 1785 he entered the corps of naval cadets, after leaving which, in 1788, with the grade of midshipman, he served in the war against Sweden. Having been appointed to serve in the English fleet for several years (1793-99), he visited America, India, and China. Having published a paper pointing out the advantages of direct communication between Russia and China by Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope, he was appointed by the emperor Alexander to make a voyage to the east coast of Asia to endeavour to carry out the project. Two English ships were bought, Krusenstern commanding the one and Lisiansky the other. Leaving Cronstadt in August 1803, Krusenstern proceeded by Cape Horn and the Sandwich Islands to Kamchatka, and thence to Japan. Returning to Europe by the Cape of Good Hope, after an extended series of explorations, Krusenstern reached Kronstadt in August 1806, his being the first Russian expedition [9:14:150] to circumnavigate the world. The emperor conferred several honours upon him, and he ultimately became admiral. As director of the Russian naval school Krusenstern did a great deal to improve the education and the position of the cadets, and in other ways the Russian navy was much indebted to his enlightened exertions. He was also a member of the scientific committee of the marine, and his contrivance for counteracting the influence the iron in vessels has on the compass was adopted in the navy. He died at Revel, August 24, 1846.

Krusenstern’s Voyage Round the World in 1803 was published at St Petersburg in 1810-14 in 3 vols., with folio atlas of 104 plates and maps (English edition, 2 vols., 1813; French edition, 2 vols., and atlas of 30 plates, 1820). His narrative contains a good many important discoveries and rectifications, especially in the region of Japan, and the contributions made by the various savants were of much scientific importance. A work of permanent value is Krusenstern’s Atlas of the Pacific Ocean, with its accompanying Recueil des Mémoires Hydrographiques, 3 vols., St Petersburg, 1824-35. See Memoir by his daughter Madame Bernhardi, translated by Sir John Ross, 1856.
