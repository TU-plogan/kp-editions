RÁMPUR, capital of the above state, stands on the left bank of the Kosila in 28° 48' N. lat. and 79° 4' E. long.; it is surrounded by a belt of bamboo trees and brushwood, with a low ruined parapet, and is the residence of the nawab, who represents the Rohilla chieftains of Rohilkhand. A lofty mosque stands in the marketplace; the streets are densely crowded together and principally built of mud. The population of the town in 1881 numbered 74,250 (males 36,355, females 37,895); it is famous for fine shawls and damask, which are exported to all parts of India.
