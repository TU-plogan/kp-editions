RÉMUSATCharles François ]Marie, Comte de (1797-1875), French politician and man of letters, was born at Paris on the 13th March 1797.. His father, also Comte de Rémusat, of a good though not very dis-! tinguished family in the district of Toulouse, was a man of! considerable literary taste, of much administrative ability, and of moderate Liberal views in politics. He was chamberlain to Napoleon, but disapproved of the emperor’s absolutist government and aggressive policy, and after the restoration became prefect first of the Haute Garonne and then of the Nord. His wife (mother of Charles) was a still more remarkable person, whose full abilities have only recently been made known. Her maiden name was Claire Elisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes. She was born in 1780, and was early introduced to the salons, which reopened after the cessation of the Terror. She married the Comte de Rémusat when she was very young, and was! long attached to the service of Josephine, to whom she was [9:20:380]finally dame du palais. Talleyrand was a particular admirer of hers, and she was generally recognized as a woman of great intellectual capacity as well as of much personal grace and charm. After her death (1824) an Essai sur VLfucation des Femmes was published and received an academic couronne. But it was not till 1879, when her grandson M. Paul de Remusat published her memoirs, which have since been followed by some correspondence with her son, that justice could be generally done to her literary talent. The light thrown on the Napoleonic court by this remarkable book was great, and !Madame de Remusat appeared as hardly the inferior of the best memoir and letter writers of the previous century. The same documents contained much information on the youth and education of her son Charles. He very early developed political views more decidedly Liberal than those of his parents, and, being bred to the bar, published in 1820 a short pamphlet on jury trial. He was also an active journalist, showing in philosophy and literature the special influence of Cousin. He was, however, at the same time a thorough man of the world, and is said to have furnished to no small extent the original of Balzac’s brilliant egoist Henri de Marsay. He took no active part in politics till the revolution of July, when he signed the journalists’ protest against the Ordinances, and in the following October was elected deputy for Toulouse. He then ranked himself with the “doctrinaires,” and supported (being a speaker of no small power) most of those measures of restriction on popular liberty which rapidly made the July monarchy unpopular with French Radicals. In 1836 he became under-secretary of state for the interior, but did not hold the post lo v ng. He then became an ally of Thiers, and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a short time. In the same year he became an Academician.

For the rest of Louis Philippe’s reign lie was in opposition till he joined Thiers in his brief and hopeless attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848. During this time Remusat constantly spoke in the chamber, but was still more active in literature, especially on philosophical subjects,—the most remarkable of his works being his book on Abélard (1845). In 1848 he was elected, and in 1849 re-elected, for the department of Haute Garonne and sat on the Conservative side. But he would not support Louis Napoleon, and had to leave France after the coup d’état; nor did he re-enter political life at all during the second empire, though his son M. Paul de Remusat stood for the Haute Garonne, and was very nearly elected, in 1869. Nor would he at first accept the advances made him after the establishment of the third republic. In 1871 he was appointed minister of foreign affairs and accepted the post. Although minister he was not a deputy, and on standing for Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by M. Barodet. A month later he was elected (having already resigned with Thiers) for the Haute Garonne by a very great majority. He died at Paris on the 6th April 1875.

During his long abstention from political life Remusat continued to write on his favourite subjects of philosophical history and especially English philosophical history. Saint Anselme de Cantor-béry appeared in 1854; L’Angleterre au XVII Feme siècle in 1856 (2d ed. enlarged, 1865); Bacon, sa vie, son temps, dec., in 1858; Channing, sa vie et ses oeuvres, in 1862; John Wesley in 1870; Lord Herbert of Chcrbury in 1874; Histoire de la philosophie en Angleterre depuis Bacon jusqu’à Locke, in 1875; besides other and minor works. The impression derived from these and from the political records of his life is that he was on the whole one of those men whose performances are unequal to their powers. He wrote well, was a forcible speaker, and an acute critic; but his adoption of the indeterminate eclecticism of Cousin in philosophy and of the somewhat similarly indeterminate liberalism of Thiers in politics probably had a bad effect on him, though both no doubt accorded with his critical and unenthusiastic turn of mind.
