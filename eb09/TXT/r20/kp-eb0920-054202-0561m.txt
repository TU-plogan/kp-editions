RICHARD earl of Cornwall and king of the Romans (1209-1272), second son of John, king of England, and IsabeLla, was born at Winchester, January 5, 1209. In 1225 he undertook the government of Gascony. In 1240 he went on a crusade, returning in 1241, after concluding a treaty with the sultan of Egypt. In 1242 he accompanied his brother on his unsuccessful expedition to Poitou. In 1244 and 1246 we find him heading the parliamentary opposition against Henry III., and a few years afterwards he befriended Simon de Montfort against his accusers. When Henry went to France in 1253, Richard, together with the queen, acted as regent. He had already (1252) declined the pope’s offer of the kingdom of Sicily, but in January 1257 he was elected emperor by a majority of the electors, and soon afterwards was crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle. In 1259 he returned to England and swore to observe the Provisions of Oxford. Next year he acted as peacemaker between Henry and the barons, and, after spending another year in Germany, he returned to England in 1263. It was largely owing to his mediation that the two parties submitted to the arbitration of Louis IX., but on the renewal of the civil war he took his brother’s side. Taken prisoner at the battle of Lewes, he was kept in confinement by De Montfort for a year, but released after the battle of Evesham. One of his last known acts was his mediation between the earl of Gloucester and the king. In 1269 he went to Germany again for a short time, and returned to England to die at Kirkham in 1272. He was thrice married—(1) to Isabella, sister of the earl of Pembroke; (2) to Sancia, daughter of Raymond, count of Provence; (3) to Beatrice of Falkenstein.
