ROCROI a town of France, the chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Ardennes, lies 15 miles in a straight line north-north-west of Mézières and within 2 miles of the Belgian frontier, at a height of 1083 feet above the sea. As a fortified place it commands the Ardennes plateau between the valley of the Meuse and the headwaters of the Oise. The present fortifications were constructed by Vauban. In 1881 the population was 1649 (commune 2977).

This spot, originally called Croix-de-Rau or Rau Croix, was fortified in the 16th century and besieged by the imperialists in 1555. Invested by the Spaniards in 1643, it was relieved by the young duke of Enghien (afterwards the Great Condé) after a brilliant victory. Captured in 1658 by the same duke, then in tlχe Spanish service, it was not restored to France till the treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. In 1815 Rocroi was besieged for a month hy the allies.
