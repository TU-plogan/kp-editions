ROBINSON John Thomas Romney (1792-1882), the inventor of the cup-anemometer, was born in Dublin on 23d April 1792. He studied at Trinity College and obtained a fellowship in 1814; for some years he was deputy professor of natural philosophy, until he relinquished his fellowship in 1821 on obtaining the college living of Enniskillen. In 1823 he was appointed astronomer of the Armagh observatory (see Observatory), with which he (from 1824) combined the living of Carrickmacross, but he always resided at the observatory, engaged in re-searches connected with astronomy and physics, until his death on 28th February 1882.

Robinson wrote a number of papers in scientific journals and transactions, and the Armagh catalogue of stars ( Places of 5345 Stars observed from 1828 to 1854 at the Armagh Observatory, Dublin, 1859), but he is best known as the inventor of the cup-anemometer for registering the velocity of the wind. This instrument (which he erected at the Armagh observatory in 1846 and which has since come into general use) consists of four light arms forming a horizontal cross, carrying four hemispherical cups and turning freely about a vertical axis. By an endless screw attached to the axis a system of wheelwork is set going, and the velocity of the wind is indicated by one or more dials, or it may be registered continuously by a pencil drawn by clockwork along a dial or drum turned by the anemometer, or (as in the modification now generally used) by a metallic screw of only one thread, which leaves a tracing on a sheet of metallic paper folded round a drum revolving by clockwork. It has been found by elaborate experiments by Dr Robinson ( Trans. R. Irish Academy, vol. xxii.; Phil. Trans., 1878 and 1880) and others that the centre of each cup moves with a velocity very nearly equal to one-third of that of the wind.
