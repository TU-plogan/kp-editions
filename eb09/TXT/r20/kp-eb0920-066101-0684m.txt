ROMANCE LANGUAGES is the name generally adopted for the modern languages descended from the old Roman or Latin tongue, acted upon by inner decay or growth, by dialectic variety, and by outward influence, more or less marked, of all the foreign nations with which it came into contact. During the Middle Ages the old Roman empire or the Latin-speaking world was called Romania, its inhabitants Romani (adj. Romanicus), and its speech Romancium, Vulgar Romancio, Italian Romanzo, from Romanixe loqui = tο speak Romance; in Old French nominative romanz, objective rornαn(t), Modern French roman, “ a novel,” originally a composition in the vulgar tongue. In English some moderns use Romanic (like Germanic, Teutonic) instead of Romance; some say Neo-Latin, which is frequently used by Romance-speaking scholars. By successive changes Latin, a synthetical language, rich in inflexions, was transformed into several cognate analytical tongues of few inflexions, most of the old forms being replaced by separate form-words. As the literary language of the ancient Roman civilization died out, seemingly extinguished by the barbarism of the Middle Ages, all the forms of the old classical language being confounded in the most hopeless chaos, suddenly new, vigorous, and beautiful tongues sprang forth, ruled by the most regular laws, related to, yet different from, Latin. How was this wonderful change brought about? How can chaos produce regularity? The explanation of this mystery has been given by Diez, the great founder of Romance philology. The Romance languages did not spring from literary classical Latin, but from popular Latin, which, like every living speech, had its own laws, not subject to the changing literary fashions, but only to the slow process of phonetic change and dialectic variety. It is wonderful how like the very oldest archaic Latin is to the youngest, Modern Romance. A great number of old sounds, forms, and expressions, which were discarded or disused by classical Latin, reappear in late vulgar Latin, and live on in the modern languages. Here especially the words of Horace come true;

“Malta renascentur, quae jam cecidere, cadentque Quae nunc sunt in honore vocabula, si volet usus,

Quem penes arbitrium est et jus et norma loquendi.”

The present article, embracing all the Romance languages, dwells chiefly on their common origin and formation. Much of their general history has been treated under Latin; only some points, especially phonetic, which need a fuller discussion, are taken up again here.

We will now briefly review the fate of popular Latin through its successive stages, showing everywhere the earliest appearance of the germs of Modern Romance.

I. First (Pre-Classical) Period: to c. 80 b.c. (Cicero).

Latin, like all other literary languages, began as a living popular speech. There was during this first period practically little difference between the vulgar and the literary language. In the oldest historical time Latin was spoken only in the small territory called Latium. The greater part of Italy proper was occupied by the Umbro-Oscan tribes, whose languages were Italic, related to Latin, yet so different as to be unintelligible to the Romans. The two most distinct types were Umbrian in the north and Oscan in the south. The chief difference between them is that Umbrian was in a much more advanced state of phonetic decay, and was in many respects a precursor of Italian and Romance, while Oscan was still more antique than Latin. When the territories where these dialects were spoken became subject to the Romans, about the beginning of the 3d century b.c., the language of the conquerors was introduced, but of course modified by the speech of the conquered. Thus two groups of provincial dialects ^[1. The Latin dialects have been investigated by K. Sittl, Die lokalen Verschiedenheiten der lateinischen Sprache, Erlangen, 1882. On Latin sounds generally see Seelmann, Die A ussprache des Latein, Heilbronn, 1885. Both these books, however, must be used with caution. Sittl has the merit of having traced the relations of North Latin, but has many rash assertions; see Zeitschr. f. rorn. Phil., vi. 608 sq. Seel-mann is superior to Corssen as a phonetician, but is often obscure and given to elaborating strange theories. Thus he arrives at the absurd conclusion that the differences of quantity did not exist in the classical age, but that the poets judged of quantity by the close or open sound of the vowel. ] were formed. (1) The North or Umbrian and Sabellian Latin, with which Etruscan Latin was closely connected, was peculiarly important, since it spread southwards and extended to the neighbourhood of Rome; thus Falerii, Praeneste, and Tusculum spoke it. Later it spread to Northern Italy. Being really a fuller development of the tendencies of the old popular Latin and easier to pronounce than literary Latin, at last from the surrounding peasantry it reached the people of Rome and became the source of the modern tongues. (2) The South or Oscan Latin was Latin with some slight phonetic modifications,
[9:20:662]

which, in Modern South Italian, have lived through the levelling influence of the north dialect. Between the Umbrians and the Oscans lay the Sabellians, occupying linguistically as geographically a middle position, yet somewhat nearer to the north dialect than to the south. To the west of Umbria lay the mysterious Etruria, whose language, preserved in numerous inscriptions, has long been an unsolved riddle and is still a matter of dispute, some considering it as utterly unconnected with Italic or even Aryan, some, as Deecke and Sophus Bugge, thinking it Aryan, intermediate between Greek and Italic, but partly decayed. In the last respect it has much in common with Umbrian, but its tendency to a rapid and slovenly utterance is still more distinctly traceable than in Umbrian.

Of the other languages spoken in old Italy, such as Messapian, Celtic, Venetian, and Ligurian, too little is known to enable us to form an estimate of their phonetic character; but in general we see the peculiarities of North Latin penetrating more or less everywhere, in the north of Italy and in Spain (subjected at the end of the 3d century b.c.), as well as in Gaul, of which the southern part, Pro-vincia (later Provence), was subjected first, and the rest, by Caesar, in the lst century b.c. All these countries were rapidly Latinized; but the provincial dialects did not always follow the phonetic development of the mother speech, just as American does not always follow the changes of English.

Old Popular Latin. A. Phonetics. 1. Final consonants, especially s, ^[2. There is nothing to prove that this s was voiced, like Eng. z ; probably it was voiceless and weakly articulated, much the same as in Andalusian Zo(Λ) padre, for Span, lοs padres, “the parents.” ] m, partly t,d,r, were feebly pronounced and often dropped in writing: s in nominatives, as Cornelio (T. Scip.), ^[3. Abbreviations— Τ. Scip., Tituli (Elogia) Scipionuιn; Col. Postr., Columns Rostrata; Baccħ., Eρistola Consolum de Bacchanalibus; T. Pis., Tituli Pisaur-enses; L. Low or Late Latin; * before a word means hypothetical. ] —even Ennius wrote eertissimu' nuntrn ’ mortis ; gen. aedem Serapi (in a law); acc. vird nostros (Plaut. ). In verse s was not counted in the metre till the manhood of Cicero, who, though he had himself followed the earlier use in his youth, calls it “subrusticum,” which shows that it continued in the country. This agrees with Umbrian, where s was often dropped, as Ikuvinu ^[4. Spaced letters signify the inscriptions in the national character, generally supposed to be older; italics mean the inscriptions in Roman letters, supposed to be younger. ] Iguvini (nom. plur.), agre agri (gen.), &c.; with North Latin, as matrοnα Pisaurese (nom. plur.; at Pisaurum); maxomo maximus, zmιatuo (gen. at Falerii) = Old Lat. senatuos; nιilitare (nom.; at Tusculum) looks quite Italian. M was often dropped, as in the well-known hone oino duonoro optumo fiuise viro (T. Scip.). It was, by the express statement of Quintilian, obscurely pronounced (see Latin), and must have been very loosely articulated, the lips probably only approaching, not closing, much like Polish D(ibrowski (Dombrowski), which gives a sound between a feeble m and a nasal vowel. In Umbrian this dropping of the nι is frequent, as poplo for populum, and in Faliscan sαeru, data. T, on the contrary, was generally retained in Old Latin, but frequently dropped in Umbrian, as dede dedit, habe habet, habia habeat; likewise in North Latin, as dede dedit, dedro and dedrot for dederunt (T. Pis.); dede (Tibur); cuρa and cupat for cubat (Fal.). Sometimes d was used, as fiecid (Praeneste), in Osc. fief acid, deded. In the perfects, however, d is perhaps the older sound. D is the final consonant that was first dropped, as in in altod marid (Col. Rostr.), a Gηaivod paire, but also longa vita (T. Scip)., later frequently. Pate(p), soro(p), colο{r), occur in Plautus with r dropped or slightly pronounced (not counted in the metre); in pate(fi) venit (Terence; see Latin); in Fal. uxo, mate ; in Aequian uxo; and in Ital. firate, suora, moglie. 2Vwas dropped in tame(n) sus-picor (Ter.); Umb. nome and numem, pointing perhaps to a weak nasal vowel; I tai. nome. 2. D after vowels sometimes became r, as ar ad, arvorsum adversum, arfiuise, arger agger,—rustic ar me advenias (Plaut., True., ii. 2); it was retained in classical Latin in arbiter, areesso, meridies. In Old Umbrian d constantly changes to a peculiar sound, here transcribed d, in Later Umbrian spelt rs, as ad, ars ad, ρetur-pnrsus quadrupedibus, dupursus bipedibus. This sound appears to be only a less trilled variety of the Roman sound. In some few instances this old r reappears later, as in Mediaeval Lat. armes-sarius (Lex Salica), in Roum. arm^sariu, I tai. drgine, Ven. drzare, Span, drcen=Lat. arger (agger). In Modern South Italian r for d is quite common, as Neap, rurece, Sicil. tZtt∕√d = Ital. dδdici, Lat. duodecim.

3. Z for s is found in some unintelligible fragments of the Carmen Saliare, mentioned by Varro {L.L., vii. 26), but in the text he says that the ancients used s for r. Coz(cηιo), but also Cosano, is found on two old coins from Cosa, though here z may be due to Oscan influence. On the other hand, veter, quirquir, were found in the ancient augural books, perhaps Etruscan Latin(?). But the ordinary form of Old Latin was s, as in asa, honos, honosis, fiosem, Loses, Fusius, Papisius, Valesius. Not z, but s or ss was used to render Greek f,— Saguηtum, cornissor, massa; in this last word (Fr. masse) the present pronunciation still testifies to the old voiceless sound. Thus the whole theory of the ancient Latin z becomes somewhat doubtful; yet it is probable that it existed in the oldest prehistoric Latin, and that forms like *easum resum were pronounced with z, like the Ose. eizazune egmazum (same meaning). Later on s (z) passed into r, following in this the Umb. urnasiaru, jn∙aeataηιm, &c. In most words Latin now got r, even in some where Umbrian retained s; comp. Lat. ara with Umb. asa, Lat. plenarius, Ordinarius with Umb. plenasier, urnasier. In Lat. nαsus—slaves the relation must be somewhat like that in À.S. ee6san, ceas—eurem, gecoren (choose, chose, chosen), probably owing to an original difference of accent. In many cases where Latin retained s it was originally double, as in caussα, cassus ( = cad-tus), thus spelt by Cicero and Virgil (Quint., i. 7, 20); fiormonsus and fiοrmοssus ; this is the reason why Italian has always s hard (voiceless) in eosa (Ven. eossa), doloroso, &c., as Ascoli has shown. Thus, every z or voiced s having passed into r, the sound z must have disappeared from the language, and it was only much later that it was reintroduced. The sound of z seems to be especially at home on Celtic ground; the voiceless sound still exists in the south of Italy (Rome, Naples, Sicily) and of Spain. The English pronunciation of Latin words like morose, jocose, and of Greek words like dosis, crisis, is probably due to ancient tradition.

4. N was often dropped before s, as cosol consol, eesor censor, eosentiont (T. Scip.), moOι)strare, Mostellαria (Plaut.); even fies-tram for fieηestram (fieKstram ; Ennius); Alliesis dies dicebatur (Fest.); 7neses (inscr. Neap.), &c.; nearly always fiormossus, far-mosus for fiormonsus (see 3). This agrees with Umb. Eikvαsese and N. Lat. Pisaurese, Pomp, eastresis, pesa, and reappears in Ital. Milanese, Genovese, mese, ρesare, Fr. mois, peser. In Latin n generally did not quite disappear, but was feebly pronounced, very like French n in penser, or probably still more like the Γolish nasal vowel in miςso, “flesh,” gfi, “goose,” half vowel, half consonant. By this partial absorption of n the preceding vowel was lengthened, eo η sol. Cicero expressly mentions insanus, Gellius pensito, the grammarians mans, mens, gens. The same was the case before ∕, as iηfielix mentioned by Cicero; n sometimes dropped before v, eoventionid (Bacch., 187 b.c.); comp. Umb. kuveitu convehito, kuvertu convertito, Fr. convent, Eng. covent, covenant. N is rarely dropped before t and d except in N. Lat. dedrο(t) (T. Pis.); but this does not count, as the t was mute. Cicero testifies to indoetus, which proves the full sound of η. The spellings tamtαe, sentemtiam, damda, tuemdam, &c., of the Lex Julia (45 b.c. ) are probably only analogical from eumdem, eamdem, &c., pronounced n. M disappears in Poρ>oni, Seprοni, but perhaps only apparently, as Priscian tells us that medial m, as in umbra, had a middling force, not the obscure sound of final m. In most old spellings, as in the Scandinavian Runes, we frequently find nasals dropped before corresponding “mutes” or stops, where there is no suspicion of an obscured sound, e.g., in Run. LAT for land the nasal is simply understood. Likewise in Umbrian the older ustetu is shown by the Latin spelling to mean ostendu, &c. In Modern Romance only Celtic districts have produced nasal vowels.

5. H is sometimes dropped from the 2d century B.c. downwards— “Parcissime ea [H littera] veteres usi etiam in vocalibus, quum oedos [read aedos} ireosque dicebant” (Quint., i. 5, 20); “in Latio rure edus, in urbe aedns'' (Varro), for Ancdî<s=Goth. gaits, “goat”; likewise olera, asta (Varro); in Marsian Lat. Irtisιs for Hirtius, Ostilins; comp. Umb. eretu = Acn7κ “velit.” H must have had a rather feeble sound, something like French h aspirée.

6. Rs is found assimilated in russum {rusum), sussum {susum), &c., in MSS. of Plautus and Cato, and in some inscriptions, always in 7)r0s(i (but prorsus) and eena, Umb. çersnatur “cenati,” dos∙ suarius (Vario); “sic et dossum per duo s . . . quidam ut levins enuntiaverunt” (Vel. Long.). Comp. Umb. Tursee, Tuscom “Tus-cum”; Ligurian Lat. suso (bronze tablet near Genoa, 117 b.c. ). But this assimilation was never carried out consistently; we have L. Lat. susum et jusτιm (sursum et deorsum), I tai. su e giiι, older suso e giuso; dosso, but corso, verso, orso (ursus), Fr. ours, Span. oso.

7. I was doubled between vowels, as in “antiqui maiiusfi which Priscian distinctly explains to have been pronounced with the sound of i consonant (Eng. y in you), and “Pompeiii ut si dicas Γοm-pelliF Cicero spelt aiio, Maiiam; “quod si est, etiam jungetur [t] ut consonans” (Quint., i. 4, 11). Comp, also Osc. Pompaiians. Out of the older and popular ηιαjjus, pejjus grew Ital. rnaggio, peggio, whereas classical Latin had mαjus, pejus. For filius —filjus, see 23 below, p. 664.

8. V occurs in Old Lat. perplovere perpluere (comp, pluvia),
[9:20:663]

confiovσnt (comp, fioviom; fiuvidus, Lucretius), sοvo, suvo, suo, iηgeηuvae, elovacas. Comp. Umb. tover and tuer, tui; Osc. suvad, &c. It reappears in Petronius, urceatim plovebat, and in Ital. ρibvere, rovιna, védova, Gènova, Mantova, chiavica, Span. llovér, Fr. pleuvoir.

9. In qu the u after q was only a lip glide, defined by the grammarians as “neither vowel nor consonant,” as it did not count in the metre. It was therefore easily dropped altogether, as in Cinti for Quincti in an old inscription. This was especially peculiar to Etruscan Latin, as in the very old Aeeetiai Aequitiae, Tarena, Etrus. Tarχnas, Tarquinius. Instances occur later everywhere, as eoeus for eoqwus, eottidie (Lex Julia), &c.; L. Lat. cinque, einquaginta (Edict. Diocl., 301); Ital. chi qui, ehe quid, eubcere coquere, eueina = vulg. Lat. coquina ( = culina), cinque, &c. But generally Italian retains qu with the old sound, quinto, quanto, Span, euaηto, but que, quinto {-k), Fr. qu = k.

10. The Old Romans, having no aspirates in their own speech,

, could not pronounce the Greek φ, χ, θ, but generally turned them into ρ, e, t, as Rilippus Φίλιπποί, Prune Φρύνη, cοlapus, Bacanal. In some words the old popular pronunciation continued later, as class, ampulla, purpura; Silver Age, percolopabant (Petron.); Mediaeval, colopus, eolpus, I tai. colριo, Fr. coup; sρ>aera, Old I tai. spera (Dante), Early Eng. spere (Chaucer), vulg. Eng. spear, “sphere”; Josepus, Ital. Giuseppe; Step<vnus, Span. Estéban, Slav. Stepan.

11. Greek initial π was often rendered b, as Βurrus Xlvphbi, also adj., “burrum antiqui quod nunc dicimus rufum” (Fest.); hence, through burtfi)eus, Ital. bujo, “dark”; likewise burns πυξ6s, Ital. busso, bosso, Fr. buis, “box tree”; from πυξis, class, pyxis, popular and L. Lat. buxis, buxida, Fr. boîte.

12. F after vowels is rare in Latin, but frequent in Umbro-Oscan, as Umb. prufie probe, Osc. ampmιfid improbe, Safinim Samnium (*Sabinium), corresponding in cognate words to Greek aspirates where Latin commonly had b : Lat. vafier, “sly,” orig. “varius”; comp, vabmt,m “varium” (Gloss. Isid.), Umb. vufru. The relation between Lat. rufus, Umb. rofu and Lat. ruber is very like that between nasus and ηrnres, or that between veho and lingo, ligurio as representing Gr. χ. We may suppose that /is the older and stronger common Italic form, sometimes retained in old popular Latin speech, partly by provincial influence. We find sifilare for sibilare mentioned as archaic by Nonius, as vulgar in the appendix to Probus, Ital. zufiolare, Fr. siffler. F is preserved in many provincial names, as Safinius (Petron. ) and Tifernum, Ital. Tifierno. We find this /again in the Italian tafiano tabanus, bûfolo bubalus, Eng. buffalo. The Neapolitan attmιfie, “ October,” has a very Oscan appearance.

13. Old Latin often prefers short e, especially original and unaccented, to i, as in dedxt, fiuxt (T. Scip.), eepet, refecet (Col. Rostr. ), velet (Bacch.), Crnuietios (inscr.), acetare = agetare (Fest.), dubenτιs dominus (Fest. ), componeto (Cato), gcnetmx, mereto, ealecare (inscr. ), fiamelia, magester (Quint. ). It stands for radical i, mostly orig. e, as in en, endo-Cχ. lv, semul (Plaut.)—comp. Ital. insieme, Fr. ensemble; Menerva (inscr., and mentioned by Quintilian). Sometimes it stands even for original i, as tempestatebus, aidiles (T. Scip. ), nαvebos, ηavaled, but marid (Col. Rostr.), sei ques, si quis (Bacch.). This is quite Umbrian; comp, kanetu canito, urfetam orbitam, fratreks “fratricus,” ∕αfβ∕eZe = L. Lat. fiaxibilis, Old Fr. fesible feasible, famedias familiae (nom. plur.), kvêstretie quaestura, formed like Lat. segnities. In North Latin we find Etrus. Lat. Aeeetiai Aequitiae; Umb. Lat. Publeee, menesterium, (T. Pis.) Apoleηei, dede, Komefiia) ; Mars, dedet, mereto ; and rustic “rustici etiam nunc quoque viam veham appellant” (Varro). E, being more subject to be obscured than i, is not unfrequently dropped, as in eante for *eanete, class, αrnιte (Carm. Sali.), Nurntoriai (inscr. c. 290 b.c. ), oinvorsei (Bacch.), unversum (Lucretius), caldus (Cato), ardus, frigdaria (Lucilius); always fieri, fierte=φιρeτe. Popular Latin here approached the North dialect, where such syncopes were constant: comp. Umb. ηοrnnc nomine, termnu termino, postro postero; they were still more violent in Etruscan, as Elχsentre Alexander, Sehtmnal Septimienâ nata, Tarχnas Tarquinius; Pis. Lat. efe<⅛o(Q dederunt, Lebro Liberum; Umb. Lat. eedre cedere, &c. South Latin, on the contrary, favoured i (see below).

14. Of long i Lucilius distinguishes two kinds—close (i tenue), as in pila, “ mortar,” and open (i ρingue), approaching to e, written ei, as in peilum, “spear,” media, “thousands”; he might have added fieilius, “son,” comp, fielare, 6ηλτf∣. There was an original diphthong eι, as in deicere, Osc. deicum, Gr. 5eικvbvαn, which was early contracted into this middle sound, exactly like Eng. ey in money from Old Fr. rnaneix. This too is quite Umbrian, spelt ei and ee, e, as enetu inito, Arch. Lat. eneito, feliuf filios, screihtor, screhto scripti, ρreve privus, Ioveine= Ij ovine, Iguvini; comp, the datives Juve paire, mchs, tefie (tibi), Ose. Diuve*, ρatere* ; also Umb. Lat. ∕eZ = filius, and Pis. Lebro. In North Latin datives in e are generally constant (Apolenei, Pis., uncontracted), as Junone matre, Jove, ρatre, Marte, &c., extending sometimes even farther south; and Gallo-Lat. nise (Lex Rubr. de Gall. Cisalp.). Livy used sibe and quase (originally -ei). This exactly agrees with the rustic pronunciation νella, speca recorded by Varro, leber by Festus—“ab antiquis et ameci et amecae per e litteram efferebantur” (Fest.). And this again surprisingly agrees with the Modern Emilian (Romagnuolo) pronunciation, as Bolognese mega mica, dég dico, méll mille, plur. τneZα=Ital. mila, véta vita, maré marito, prém primo. Thus this old rustic sound seems to have extended northwards, but later to have been driven from its old home by the classic close i, which penetrated everywhere else, and is generally represented in all the Romance languages.

15. Old Latin often prefers short o, especially original and un accented, to u, as in consol (T. Scip.), tabola (Bacch.), pocolom (many old inscr.), popolum (Tab. Bantina), cpistola = iπισrολn, Patricoles, Hereοles, eolpa (Prise. ), Voleanom (inscr. 3d century b.c.), volgo and volt, &c,c. (Plaut.; o after v continued in the classical age), sont sunt, eosentiont (T. Scip.), deηοηtiari (Tab. Bant.); in terminations— Venos, ορos, robose, filios, and Luciom, &c. (T. Scip.); in Umb acc. ρoplo, salvo, tertio ; even for orig. u—aseriato eest, observa-tum ibit; radical—mo‰multa, “fine,” onse (h)umero, I tai. 0mero, Span, ombro, somo summo (orig. sup-mo), Ital. s6mmο ; in North Latin moltaticod (T. Piceu. ); in Fal. maxomo, zenatuo ; and in Ligurian Latin fioviom, infiumo, suso (bronze tablet near Genoa, 117 b.c.). 0 reappears in Late Latin and Italian m6lto, d6lee, &c.

Medial o is often dropped before l, as in οrnmpoplo (Plaut. Pseud.), teglarius (inscr.), Fostlus (Faustulus, 114 b.c. ), Herele (Plaut. ), singlariter (Lucr. )—comp. Fr. sanglier, I tai. einghiale—eoplata (Lucr.); in some cases, as poclum, periclum, the contraction does not appear till the empire; at Pompeii aηglata, subla, &c. As Umbrian always has contraction, pihaelom, anglom, Treblaηir, vitlu, katlu, stiplo, whilst Oscan distinguishes diminutive forms like zicolom, zicelei, ziculud from such forms as sakaraklom, pestlerm, the strongest impulse must have come from the north, although there must have been a pretty general tendency to syncope everywhere. In Italian contraction is the rule in popular words, as veechio for vet'lus, Late veelus, ocehio oc’lus, &c. In pbpolo, tdvola, isola, &c., and diminutives like rivolo and g6ndola, the original vowel has remained throughout. South Latin favoured u (see below).

16. The use of o for e after v is shown by Old Lat. oinvorsei, vortere; in vostrum (Plaut., Ambrosian palimpsest), the original sound (from vos) occurs, which must have been universal in popular speech, since it reappears in Late Latin and all the Romance languages—Ital. vostro, Fr. votre, &c. There was a tradition that Scipio Africanus had been the first to spell these words with e (Quint., i. 7, 25). Here Umbrian distinguished between e and o, as in vestra, eoιxrtu (pres.), but covortzιs (perf.); Lat. vorsare is perhaps Span. vosar, bosar, “to vomit”; in other words e is now universal.

17. U occurred for i before labials; but the old optumo has scarcely left any trace, yet Ital. has menοmo besides minimo. Later u was pronounced with the sound of ii, Gr. υ, Fr. u,, which at last was turned into i, as in optimus, Ital. ottimx. But in some few words the old popular form has survived— stupula, Ital. st6ppia, Fr. étouble, “stubble,” dissupare, Ital. sciupare.

18. U stands for o—“Frundes, fiuntes vetustissimi; quae tarnen a primoribus repudiata sunt, quasi rustico more dicta” (Prise.)— contrary to the general rule (see 15). Spellings like muns, muntem, fiuntem abound in Late Latin, as puntifiex (already in 98 a.d.), ∑eπτοpουvτιιρ (Plut., e. 100); whence Old Fr. and Old Eng. muηt, “mount,” Ital. m6nte, p6nte, fi6nte with close o. In Sienese we have even pognxre, poηto, Ital. and Florentine pugnere, punto (pungere, pùnctum); the connexion, however, of ό with Old Latm u is doubtful.

19. Greek u was pronounced u, as in Bruges Φρbyes, Rurrus, purpmra, gubernum, gιdernare, (nιpressus,— the last four also classical; otherwise the classical age adopted the Greek sound y, as in Cyprus. In popular Latin the old sound remained, and u was sometimes (before r, as in fiore) even changed into o, as in storαx (Ter.), aneora (Naevius). In Low Latin n is frequent: cuprum, “copper,” for which Pliny used Cyρriurn (αes); comp, bursa, Ital. bôrsa, Fr. bourse, crupta, Ital. grotta, tumba, Ital. tomba, &c.

In popular Latin there was a general tendency to contract the old diphthongs, in accordance with Umbrian and North Latin.

20. Au in North Latin began very early to be contracted into long openo, as Rola (inscr. Picen., 218 b.c. ). In Umbrian this is a constant law— ote aut, Ital. b, Umb. Zorιt tauros, Ital. tbro, &c. The only form of the oldest Roman Latin was au, as Taurasia, CP)aulla (T. Scip.), Claudi (Bacch.). When the Umbrian poet whose provincial name was Plot(u)s settled in Rome in the latter half of the 3d century b.c. his name was Latinized into Plautus. Meanwhile the North Latin ô began to penetrate into Latium as rustic, vulgar, and familiar; Cato and Varro often use it in their books De Re Rustieα, as coles (Cato), colis, orata (Varro): “Orata genus piscis appellatur a colore auri, quod rustici orum dicebant, ut auriculas, amendas” (Fest.). But in the classical age there was a good deal of reaction against this vulgarism, and there is a well-known anecdote of Mestrius Floras warning the emperor Vespasian against saying plostra, and being next day facetiously greeted by the emperor as Flaurus (Suet., Vesρ., 22). At Pompeii
[9:20:664]

copo took the place of cauρo, o(p')scultat of auscultai. It is scarcely possible to fix the precise period at which ô for an became general with the upper classes; but, as it was never changed into ub like the original open o, the general contraction of au is probably later than that of ae to è, which was accomplished about the time of the introduction of Christianity. That the contracted sound is open o, not closed, may be inferred from the Italian ύ in oro, tοro, cosa, poveτo, in Old French chbse, pbvre, as is shown by the rhymes, only in Mod. Fr. ch6se, pdvre (etymologically spelt pauvre). The Eng. cause, sauce, poverty, have kept the Old French sound; the Spanish forms are cosα, oro, pobre. The old diphthongal pronunciation of au was never quite lost, but preserved in literary tradition all through the Middle Ages, as in Italian and Spanish literary words like causa. It even appears to have been popular in some Roman provinces, judging from the Prov. ρaubre, causa, in Mod. Prov. c6uzο (spelt by the French “coouso”), and the Portug. ouro, causa (also oirο, coisa). Even Fr. chose, chou presuppose causa, caulis, not cosa, eοlis. In Italian, words like cavolo, “cabbage,” Paolo, “Paul,” are rare exceptions. It is to be especially noted that cauda seems to be false, coda being the correct Latin form, which is corroborated by Ital. c6da with close o. Some philologists, however, think 6 is the old contraction, unconnected with ά.

21. Ae, oldest form ai, occurs very early, as in axs, praedad (Col. Rostr.), and was general at the time of the Gracchi. The difference between ai and ae is really very slight, the sound of i being open, which is very near “raised c” (both vowels occur in Eng. pity'). The pronunciation must have been essentially the same as in the Osc. aι, which in the Latin transcription of the Tab. Bantina wavers between ai and ax. The contraction of ax into é first occurs in the north, where it was constant, for example Umb. kvestur, pre, mestro magistra, dat. ase arae; North Latin— Fal. ρretbοr), Cesilia; T. Pis. Cesula; Etrus. Lat. Quxeili (= Cecili for Caecilii), Cηevia Gnaevia, Gnaeja, &c. From the north it spread to Latium, where it first occurs as a rustic pronunciation scoffed at by Lucilius, as quoted by Varro: “Rustici Pappum Mesium, non Maxsium, a quo Lucilius scribit— Cecilius Fretσr ne rusticus fiat.” “In Latio rure edus, in urbe axdus" (Varro). We finde for ax quite commonly used in the vulgar dialect of the 1st century A.D.,—at Pompeii letus, queres, elate, presto, tabule, qux. In Rome e became the pronunciation of the upper classes only in the Christian period, 3d and 4th centuries, as Emiliano, φe∖eιe = filiae (inscr. 3d century), Cesar (4th century). Servius (4th century) says “2 is pronounced almost like ae,” that is, with the same sound, only shorter (at least in theory), equus like axquus.

22. In Old Latin compound words often did not soften their radical vowel; the preposition being then an adverb, and each word having a distinct stress, the compound was separable, as in manum endxjaeito (XII. Tables) = injicito; ob vossacro, vosobsecro, and sub vos placo, vos supplico, in ancient prayers; transqux dato = “et tradito,” in ancient laws. This was imitated by classic poets (tmesis)— vιqux ligatus (Virg.). Only some of these separable compounds continued later on, such as the intensifying per, in per ecastor seitus (Ter.), nobis ista sunt pergrata perqτce juxunda (Cic., De Or.), per mihi mirum visum est (Cic., ibfi, Platoni per fuit familiaris (Gellius). Instances of the unchanged vowel in verbs— écquid placeant, mé rogas? immo vero hercle pérplaxent (Plaut.), and ea mihi perplaxet (Cic.), to which correspond exactly the Old Fr. par est bons, par me plaist. While the older Latin accentuation was dffakim, ddmodurn, these words seem at the time of Gellius to have been pronounced affdtim, adm6dum. We have here a first step towards the modern system of accenting the last element of compounds; comp, the modern Comasco ammb, Roum. amù, “just now.” Quo modο is continued in Ital. cowιc, but is formed anew in the dialectic eom6dx, cmbd. In Late Latin and Romance the old system reappears unimpaired; many of the old compounds, having been lost in popular speech, were formed anew with stress on the last element and unchanged vowel: for instance, class, displieet, vulg. displdxet, Ital. disρidxe, Span, despldee, Fr. déplaît ; class. dxcuUt, vulg. αccddeζ Ital. αccdde (inf. axcadére); rélégo becomes Ital. rileggo, &c.

23. Stress, which in Old Latin was often farther from the end than in classical Latin, seems early to have become pretty strong,

. so as to induce the voice to hurry over unaccented syllables even though they were long by position (see Latin), as magistratus, ministerium, rotwιtαte, in Plautus, where st,nt were pronounced as quickly as in Eng. voluntary, magistrate. The vowels, too, were hurried over; that fiériéstra was pronounced as fieristra is corroborated by the Ennian fiestra =fe n stra,—comp. Ital. mestiero = ministerium. Scansions like sαgUtis, simlllurnax show that double consonants might count as long or short; position was not regarded so nicely as in Greek till the classical age. The real reason may have been the stress on the first syllable. In accented syllables double consonants cannot have been really short, considering the full length of Italian‘double consonants in bello, anno, saétta, &c. Likewise final vowels of iambic words were shortened, as novo, habe, ρuta, bene, homo (see Latin). This is important, as marking the first step towards the Romance levelling of the old quantities.

This tendency, too, was carefully restrained during the classical age, but reappears early in the post-classical period. Another effect of the strong popular stress is the pronunciation of i before vowels as a consonant; thus words like fiilTus in Plautus often count as two syllables, filjus (fi = Eng. y).^ This is evidently the preparatory stage to the Romance figlio, &c., with palatal l,—l and j having been fused into one sound. This pronunciation, too, was carefully suppressed by the classics.

B. Vocabulary.— We append, in chronological order, a brief selection of archaic words, disused, vulgar, colloquial, or used with a disparaging sense, in the classical age, but reappearing later as quite usual and dignified expressions. The many modern derivatives should be noticed.

Cic.)—Ital. gridare, Fr. crier. Greek words— gubernum, “rudder,” Ital. governo; sehxdium, “improvised or unpolished poem,” Ital. sehizzo, “sketch”; caballus, “jade,” seems first to occur here—optât arare caballus (Hor.)—later “horse,” “steed,” Ital. cavallo, Span, caballo, Fr. cheval, L.

Declensions: lade lac, I tai. latte (Petron. unum laetem biberunt); vasum, Umb. vaso(r), Ital. vaso; ossum, Ital. osso, Fr. os; pauper,-a,-um (also Petron. ), Ital. povero. Comparison: magis pulcer = Span. mas hermoso; even magis majores, as vulg. Ital. ρiiι meglio, vulg. Fr. plus meilleur, vulg. Eng. more better (er). The ordinary Romance formation with plus only appears in the 3d period. With ego ipsissumus, “my very self,” comp, ipsimus, “himself,” ix., the master of the house (Petron.). Out of (ρgp)md-iρsimυs grew Ital. medesimo, Span, mismo, Fr. même. Pronouns: dat. fern, illae for illî, Ital. le ; eccRm = ecce eum, Ital. eeeo— pater eccwmadvenit= eeeo ehe viene il padre; eeeiste, eccZsZα = Old Fr. cist, ceste, Mod. Fr. ce, cet, cette; eeeille, eeeilla = Old Fr. cil, cele, Mod. Fr. celui, celle. In Italian these were replaced by eeeum istum, Ital. questo, and eeeum ilium, Ital. quello, analogous to the Plautine eeeum ipsum, eeeam eampse, kx.; quotumus, “which of the number”— quotumo die hue pervenisti? Ital. lavorare a eöttimo, “work by the job.” Unus indefinite was sometimes very like the modern indefinite article—Huic filia una est, “he has a daughter,” Ital. quest’uomo ha wnα figlia. Ille was sometimes used very like the modern definite article—Imponit geminorum alterum in nave pater, ilium reliquit alterum apud matrem domi, Ital. lasciδ l'altro colla madré a casa. Note also ηatus nemo in aedibus, “not a living soul,” “not a mother’s son,” Span, nαeiie, “nobody,” likewise from nata (res), Span, nada, “nothing,” whereas the Catalan prefers res, Prov. ren, re, Fr. rien (rem).

Active for deponent— joeare, Ital. giocare, Fr. jouer, part ire = I tai.; fabu,lare, Span, hablar. Perfects in si—-parsi, prae- morsi, Ital. morsi ; the formation in si greatly increased in Romance. Habere with past part, often approaches to modern compound tenses, Res omnis relidas habeo, Ital. ho lasciato tutto. Adverbs: A liorsum ire for alio, Prov. alhors, Fr. ailleurs. Prepositions: de for genitive, dimidium de praeda mihi dare, Ital. la meta del bottino; mZ for dative, te ad patrem esse mortuom re-nuntiem, Ital. dire al padre; cum instrumental, eum virgis caseum rädere, ItaL eon; de instr., quam ilia de meis opulentiis fiat pro-pensior, Ital. di. Peculiar local uses are in Ephesum ire, in Epheso esse, ab domo, “ from home,” ex Epheso, “ from Ephesus ”; ab, from (at) one’s house, as Esne tu ab illo milite, servus ejus = from (at) the soldier’s, foris concrepuit a vieino sene, Ital. dal soldato, dal veeehio vieino Syntax and Phraseology.— Pater tuus is erat patruelis meus; comp. Fr. le père est-ZZ, Ital. il padre lo conosco. Pone aedem ibi sunt homines, Ital. vi sono degli uomini. Scio jam quid vis dicere, Ital. so (quel) ehe vuoi dire. Ne time, ne fae, Fr. ne fais pas cela. Totus gaudeo, tota sum misera, even Cic. falsum est id totum, “it is all false,” Ital. è tutto falso, son tutta contenta, Fr. elle est toute joyeuse. Multum miseri, even Cic. fam. multum bonus, Ital. molto buono, Span, muy bueno, Port, muito born. Bene morigerus (Plaut.), bene saepe (Enn.), bene mane (Cic.), Ital. ben bene, ben tosto, Fr. bien bon, bientôt, bien souvent. Bene velle alieui, Ital. voler bene ad alcuno. Epityrum estur insane bene (Plaut. ), showing that the furieusement bien of the Précieuses was no novelty. Aequo animo stare, Ital. star di buon animo; stabam tanquam mortuus (Petron.), Ital. stava come morto, stare in letto, star seduto, &c. Dictum (αc) factum (Ter.), Ital. detto fatto, “said and done.” Cum (bona) gratia, “with a good grace” (Ter.), Fr. de bonne grâce. Id restabat (deerat, ut), used ironically, (Ter.), It. questa mancava aucora, Fr. il ne manquait (plus) que cela.

II. Second {Classical) Period·. 80 b.c. to 100 (150) a.d.

At this time we begin to have an idea of what South Latin was, of which the chief characteristics were—(1) its conservative character, supported by the antique forms of the Oscan language; (2) its preferring i to e, as in siηaturn, einsuerint, eintum, rim, ris, diibus (Lex Jul.; Heraclea); nigatis, tenimus, Lueritivs, dieembres, oeilli (Pompeii), ZeraZiZMω = Mod. Neap, tenimmo; fmιmiηte), siptim (Pute-oli); venirandax (Nap.); later sieundo, siptim (Borgia, 386); (3) its preferring u to o, as in fτι,rtunilla, postera, aliu (Pompeii). These forms are constant in Modern South Italian. Now classical

Latin was an approach to South Latin, and there arose a strong reaction against the vulgar North Latin forms. But even a purist like Cicero could not always abstain from using colloquial forms, and he sometimes gives us precious information about familiar pronunciations, as cun nobis for eum nobis, showing the assimilation of mn to nn. He hesitates to use the new word medietas, which later became the ordinary expression, Ital. meta, Span, mitad, Fr. moitié. Catullus has involare, “steal,” Ital. involare, Fr. voler, and basium, Ital. bacio (for basio, bagio, like eaxio caseus), Span, beso, Fr. baiser, and the familiar caressing issa for ipsa, Ital. essa. He and Horace have ρlatea, ‘ ‘ street” (for platêa = πλατεία), Ital. piazza, Fr. place. Vitruvius has octuaginta, Ital. ottanta, aperegre = ,, from abroad,” and the Greek words chalare, Ital. calare, zelus, Ital. geloso, Fr. jaloux, and sehidia, “wooden chip,” “splinter,” Ital. scheggia. The transition from b to v begins, triumphavit for -bit (Lex Jul. ). Gradually the popular speech undermined the classical correctness of the brief Golden Age, and at the beginning of the empire again rose to the surface. The emperor Augustus was fond of talking slang and bad grammar, as simus for sumus, and he wrote as he spoke in his familiar letters, although he was very hard upon a poor legatus eonsularis for barbarously writing ixi instead of ipsi (fin&ï., Aug., 88; comp, proxirnus for propsimus).

At Pompeii and Herculaneum we find a town dialect fully developed, half South Latin, half vulgar Roman. Final consonants were dropped, for instance m in the acc. puella, laudata; t in the verse “quisquis ama valia, peria qui nosei (? = nescit) amare (Pomp. ); s rarely, valea = valeas (Pomp. ). II, the right pronunciation of which had become a mark of education, just as in English (Rusticus fit sermo, si aspires perperam; Nigid. Figulus), was constantly dropped, as in abeto, abuaerit (Pomp.), abiat (Here.). Nη took the place of nd: vereeuηnus (Pomp.), later innulgen. (Abella, 170 a.d.), αgeηnae (Puteoli), were generally Italic; comp. Umb. ρihαηer piandi (distennite, dispennite, Plaut. ), Ose. opsannam operandam; now South Italian — Roman monno, Neap. munno, Sicil. munnu= Ital. mondo, Lat. mundus. Ns was used for es (x) as in words in -triss for -true (Pomp.). Φ popularly became p, as Aprodite, but with those who tried to speak fine f, just as they made the Greek υ an i—Iαointus, Amarillis, Dafne, Filetus, Ital. fisieo, fisonomia, &c. E for oe seems first to occur during the empire, for example, pomerii (8 n.c.), ρomerium (49 a.d. ), Phebιιs (Pomp.). There is no certain evidence of the sound of Germ, o, Fr. eu; we see that the first vowel is absorbed by the second. According to Diez, oe becomes close e, ax open e, which is true for popular words like Ital. pena, Fr. peine, but untrue for Latinisms like fete, fèdo, amène), eèto, eommèdia, tragèdia, Fèbo, oe in Low Lat. being constantly confounded with ae. Original oe never becomes ie, as ae does (cZeZo, fieno). Vocabulary.— We remark at Pompeii exmueeαvit emunxit, Ital. dial, smoeeare, “snuff (the candle)”; mi similat, Ital. mi somiglia, Fr. il me ressemble, elsewhere only in Late Latin. Petronius: bisaeeium, Ital. bisaccia, Fr. besace; nxsapius, “unwise,” Ital. sâvio, sâggio, Span, sâbio, Fr. sage; berbex, Fr. brebis; peduelus, Ital. pidocchio, Fr. pou (ρaηus facit diminutivum yxmwciiZa, Fest., Ital. pannocchia—comp. L. Lat. geηueulum, axucula, Ital. ginocchio, agocchia, Span, hinojo, aguja, Fr. genou, aiguille); striga, “witch,” Ital. strega; fatuus, Fr. fat; basiavit me sρissius, Ital. spésso, “often.” Instances of Petronius’s grammar are— virus, eaelιιs, comp. Old Fr. vins, ciels ; jacebat tanquam bovis, Ital. bove, bue; hoc vetare nec Jovis potest (Old Lat. Jovis pater= Jupiter), Ital. Giove; munus excellente, neuter, shows the L. Lat. declension, Ital. eccellente; habet wnele=i∖ a de quoi (vivre); unus de nobis= uno di noi (see also Latin). Pliny mentions sanguisuga as vulgar for hirudo, Ital. sanguisuga, Fr. sangsue; he has gyτare = Ital. girare, “turn,” “roam about.” Persius (34-62) has stloρpo tumidas rumpere buccas, “a slap,” L. Lat. sclopus, sclupare, Ital. schioppo, “gun.” Quintilian (c. 40-118): 5υvατοv quod nostri possibile nominant, quae ut dura videatur appellatio, tarnen sola est, Ital. possibile, &c. Juvenal has buccâ foeulum excitât, Ital. fuoco, Fr. feu, and Tacitus spatha, Ital. spada, Fr. épée (see also Latin).

III. Third {Post-Classical) Period·. 100 (150) to 300 (350).

This period is represented by the latest pagan inscriptions, by Gellius, Apuleius, &c. On the decay of classical Latin, see Latin. In pronunciation only few decided changes appear.

1. I is inserted before s impurum, as iseripta (Afr., 197), nστreLρeι,τω = ispirito (Rome, 269); later this was universal, but in Italian only after consonants— non ista (colloq. non stà), in isρirito, in iscrUto ; Span, always, as espiritu, esta, escribir, escuela; Fr. esprit, écrire, école.

2. Tt is put for pt, as Setemb. (Helvet., 219), Setimus (Afr., 3d century), later frequent. This assimilation originally came from the north; comp. Etrus. Lat. Nethunus (th=t), Etrus. Neθuns, Neptunus, Etrus. Lat. Setχιmnal, Etrus. Sehtmnal— Septimienâ nata
[9:20:666]

(inscr. biling.), Setume, Setimi, Septimius, Umb. scrcihtor, serehto, Ital. Settimo, Xettuno, atto aptus, cattivo, scritto.

3. Tt takes the place of et, as in Beneditus (204), lattuea (Edict. Diocl., 301). This too came from the north; Vitoria occurs on an ancient mirror, probably Etruscan. Comp. Umb. subahtu and subator, formally = su bacti, rehte recte, where/;, originally sounded, had become mute or nearly so, which is further proved by the spellings anibrehtu, ambretu, ambito, &c.; comp, tettvrn{e), probably = Ital. tetto tectum, just as Ital. retto rectus, atto actus, otto octo, notte noctem. This change was restricted to Italy; elsewhere et became it, as Fr. fait factum, Port, feito, Span, hecho ( = *feitjo). Likewise cs (x) became in Italy ss, as in Lat. eossim, vissit, elsewhere is, as Span, and Port, seis, Fr. cuisse, laisser.

4. G before a single e, i becomes palatal (like the old-fashioned Eng. gyarden, &c.) or nearly y (Eng. y in yσu∖ so that both are confounded— magestati (inscr. before 243); cogiugi, conjugi. The sign for J in the Gothic alphabet, taken from Latin G, shows the pronunciation of the 4th century.

5. Xgη for gη, as eongnato, singno, belongs perhaps to this period— connate, &c., is also found—E. Ital. seng no, now spelt segno, with palatal n, degno dignus, regno regnum, &c., Fr. digue, &c.; sometimes n(τι), as in eonôseere, Fr. connaître. There are traces of some other transitions that appear to have been completed only in the next period.

6. Vocabulary.— Apuleius has sapidus, “savoury” (comp, insipidus), Old Fr. sadx, whence Fr. maτcssade (mal-sade); rnarsicare = Ital.; follicare, “breathe” (like a bellows), Port, folgar, J3pan. holgar, “rest,” “lounge”; masticare, Ital. masticare, Fr. mâcher; minari (equunι baculis), “threaten,” hence “drive,” Ital. menare, Fr. mener; cambiare (better than eambire), Ital. cambiare, Fr. changer; victηαlis adj., in the 6th century subst. vietualia (nom. plur. ), Old Fr. and E. Eng. vitaille, Eng. vittles, spelt etymologically victuals; aucilla, aueella for avieella, the existence of which had been denied by Varro, L. Lat. aueellus, Ital. uecello, poet, augello, Prov. auzels, Old Fr. οisel, Mod. Fr. oiseau. Caelius Aurelianus (2d or 3d century) has testa, “skull,” frequent in the 4th century, I tai. testa, “head,” Fr. tête. Lampridius (c. 250): ρapilio = pavilion, ∕w∕∕icmMS, Ital. pulcino, Fr. poussin; pipio, “pigeon”; ]datea, “place.” Tertullian, first Christian author: rememorare, “remember,” aeternalie, “eternal,” eompassio, “ compassion,” and many other modernisms, such as plus miser= I tai. piu misero, Fr. plus miserable. Diocletian: fata, parca, Ital. fata, Fr. fée. Solinus (c. 3d century): repatriare, “to repair (to).” Apicius (c. 3d century): exealdare, I tai. scaldare, Fr. échauder; spatula, ltal. spalla, Span, espalda, Fr. épaule.

IV. Fourth Period : 300 (350) to 500 (550).

This period extends from the introduction of Christianity to the Middle Ages and the great migrations. Christianity marks an important epoch in the history of the Romance languages. Pagan literature was abhorred, and classical traditions lost. Popular speech got the upper hand; the gospel was preached to the people in the people’s own language, and the New Testament translated into vulgar Latin. Several phonetic changes which formerly had been wavering and uncertain became rapidly fixed and decided. The whole language was revolutionized.

1. Palatal g οrj was developed into dj (like gy in Hung. Magyar =palatal d + Eng. y) or dzh (Eng. j), sometimes dz, and was confounded with original di—Zerax, Hierax (Cumae, 202); Zoυλιoe (pagan inscr.), comp. Diuliali (568), Madias (364), also Mazas = majas, Gianuaria (503), also Zanuari, &c. Italian still retains the sound of dzh in giungere jüngere, Giove Jovem, gènere, giacére, &c. Original di in Aziabenico (Afr., 195), niedius, pronounced medsius according to Servius (4th century) and Consentius (5th century), Ital. mezzo, pronounced med∙zo (but giorno from diurnus). 2. Ti was assibilated before vowels; there are no certain pre-Christian instances. In the 4th century the Gothic laiktjδ= lectio shows that the change had only begun; ci and ti were sometimes confounded, as in κdλτtos calceus (Plut., c. 100; Ed. Diocl., 301), ocio (Rome, 389); we have ti for si in aecletiae (early Christ, inscr.). In the 5th century the change appears as fully accomplished; the grammarian Pompeius (probably a Mauretanian) expressly teaches the pronunciation Titius as Titsius, and Consentius (a Gaul) etiam as eziam, i.e., etsiam. In the 6th century we have the Gothic kavtsjoη, cautionem. It is probable that this change too originally came from the north, especially from Etruria, where it was very old: we have Etrus. Ventia Venza, Arηθia Arηza, Etrus. Lat. Vencsi, Vensius, Arnzius (while Umbrian has tertio, Martie, &c. ), Mars. Lat. Martses, evidently the source of the Latin Marsi. At length this pronunciation reached the capital and became general, mostly expressed by c, as in eciarn, ter· eins, milieia, justieia, staeio, ηacioηem, &c. The pronunciation ts is confirmed for Spain by Isidore in the 7th century. This sound is still preserved by Italian in words like piazza, grazia, naziωιe, giustιzia, likewise by Old French, as naeium, place, whereas in Spanish ts has coalesced into a lisped s, as in gracia, nation, and in Portuguese, Provençal, and Modern French it has been assimilated into a hard (voiceless) s, as in plαςa, plαssα, place.

3. Ci was assibilated before vowels. In the 4th century we have the Gothic faskja, which shows no change. Schuchardt is probably right in supposing that ci was assibilated a good deal later than ti, —an inference from the comparative rarity of instances of change, and from the silence of the grammarians. From instances like ocio (see 2) it would appear that ci and ti had the same sound, but this cannot have been the case, as Italian still keeps up a difference, as in piaeeia placeat, piazza platea. Yet there may have been a beginning of a palatal affection, making the two sounds somewhat like each other. In the 6th century we have the Gothic unkjane (unciarum) and οvvκια in the Ravenna charters, but on the other hand πpcκαω=preeio for pretiο, Urbitcηιs (533, which, however, may be a miscorrection, c being added instead of substituted for ∕), Mauriscius on a Gaulish coin, from the same period,—making it probable that the assibilation had been accomplished. In the 7th and 8th centuries spellings like οnzia for uncia are quite common.

4. The most important change of all was the victory of stress over quantity and tones. The popular songs of the classical period show a decided prevalence of accent. In the soldiers’ songs from the end of the 3d century stress has quite superseded quantity and is the ruling principle of the metre :—

“Unus Λ<⅛ι.o mille, mille, mille decollavimus.

Tantum vini nemo Λtiδei quantum fudit sanguinis.”

This is just like the metre of early Christian hymns— “Dies irae, dies ilia,” and “O Rex aeterne, Démine,” tzc. The old quantities had been levelled. St Augustine (354-430) says that in his time only a few grammarians had kept up the distinction between rnδrae and more, and that the Africans confounded tis and os. Servius (4th century) could only find out quantity from stress in words like impius, amicus. Consentius says that some, especially Africans, said piper for piper and δrator for orator. This does not necessarily mean that all short accented vowels before single consonants had become long; probably both short and long coalesced to a medial quantity, rather short than long, and there was no very marked difference of quantity between accented and unaccented vowels. This appears plainly from the nature of Romance poetry, where stress has only a moderate importance—namely, in the most prominent parts of the verse — while the chief principle is the number of syllables. In Italian, especially in the Tuscan dialect, we may hear bambino with short accented i, the unaccented o being rather longer than the accented i, just as Eng. y in pity, when emphatic, is longer than i. In Spanish words like mΑno, primêro, senôra the accented vowel is generally as short as the unaccented or even shorter, which does not prevent the Spaniards from counting it as “dos tiempos” (duas moras); the unaccented final syllables are often rather longer, as in Eng. pity. In Italian the longest syllables are those containing two or more consonants after the accented vowel, as tèmpo, paziènza, bôcca, gatto ; the chief difference between fdtto and fdto is the length of the t in the former. In Spanish and French even long consonants are shortened, as Span. bοca, gato, Fr. chatte·, jette and achète are equally short; vowels are generally short or medial, as une belle ville (not like wα∕, as the English make it), and are long only by compensation, as in ane, chante (where the nasal is absorbed by the vowel). The old distinction of tone necessarily disappeared with these, the acute or high even iR,oma) and the circumflex or high falling tone (A5wα) being dependent on the quantities.

V. Fifth Period·. 500 (550) to c. 900 (1000).

This period, which extends from the migrations to the first appearance of the modern Romance languages, is the age of Low or barbarous Latin, as written especially in charters and laws. While Christianity had brought vulgar [9:20:667]Latin into the foreground, barbarism quite made away with literary Latin. Latin was not only dead but forgotten. The old sounds and forms had been lost, and the scribes, ignorant of classical grammar, tried nevertheless to make a show of learning by putting Latin forms at random. This makes the language look much more barbarous than it really was. It is sometimes very hard to find out the living popular form under the Latin varnish, and harder still to find out what is proper to each country, as Low Latin is very much the same everywhere. The following were some of the chief peculiarities.

1. Old Latin forms reappeared, especially in Italy. Final consonants, especially m, t, s, were dropped or wrongly put. In Italy the nom. annus (-os), the ace. annum {-om), the dat. abl. anno, the ace. plur. anιws, coalesced in anno ; as this was the real pronunciation, the scribes confounded the Latin forms. There being no longer any difference between in locum and in loco, both were confounded; even in locus, per locus, Ac., were written. The prevalence of the type anno on the one hand and the growing use of the preposition de for the genitive on the other made the genitive anni disappear, and anni (with which annis coalesced) was used solely for the plural, likewise fiori, month Sometimes, as in Old French, the objective form anno, Old Fr. an, was used as a genitive, of which Hôtel-Dieu is still a remnant. In the same way Ital. rosa became the common singular, rose the common plural form. Out of Italy, final s being retained, the plural form was annos, rosas, flores, which is the Spanish (a»os) and Portuguese form, and partly the French, as roses, with fleurs and ans as accusatives. In Provençal and Old French s was kept in the nom. sing, masc., ans, but in the nom. plur. the oldest form was i, retained in some Old French monosyllables— li illi, did, trei, tuit from tutti, used in the Gloss, of Cassel; in polysyllables this i was lost, and an remained, likewise fior Cfiori; comp, sapienti, Gloss. Cass.), munt. The verbs canto, cantos, cantat in Spanish only lost t ; in Ital. cantαs through eaηtis (caused by the affinity of s to i) became eanti. In French both s and t were kept— chante, chantes; chaηtet, later chante; est, vit, vient, and from the analogy of these Mod. Fr. aime -t -il, chante-t-il. Many old tenses were lost, as <mα(ι⅝)rαnι, which even in Latin sometimes had the sense of the simple past (see Latin), only in the oldest Fr. rovéret, roga(ve)rat = rogavit. Ama(fi)i became Ital. amah Fr. aimai, and was used as simple past (perfectum historicum); the praesens perfectum was expressed by a new tense, as habeo amatum (of which early germs are found), Ital. ho amato, Span, he amαdο, Fr. fiai aimé. The old future was destroyed and a new future formed out of aman habeo (of which early traces are found), Old Ital. ameraggio, Mod. I tai. awierô, Span, amuré, Fr. j’aimerai, Ac. In consequence of the general loss of body, short words dwindled down so much that they became unfit for use, and were superseded by fuller words or reinforced by composition; this is especially the case in pronouns and particles. As αcZ became a, Lat. a, ab could no longer keep its ground, and was replaced by de, likewise vis by fortia, Ac. (see Latin). Hie disappeared and was replaced by iste, which remained uncomposed in Span, este, and in the others was composed with ecce, cecum (see above). Abαnte, Mod. Ital. avanti, Fr. avant, occurs in a pagan inscription. Lat. unde became de unde, Ital. donate ; in Spanish this was further composed with αd, as adonde, and as this in time came to mean “where” a new de had to be added,— de adonde, he. 2. C became assibilated before single e, i. That during all the preceding periods c had the sound of k is proved by Old Latin spellings like dekem ; by Greek transcriptions, as 'F.ικlρων, Kαισαρ; by the German renderings Kaiser (Old Eng. cdsere}, Keller, “ cellar,” Kirsche, “cherry,” Ac., and by the use of c for k in Old English, as in cynne, “kin,” cennan, “ken”; by late Latin spellings like ques-quenti, quiescenti, pαche (Rome, 408), chingxit (Gaul, 676), vachis (Lucca, 722)—in Italian still ch=k, as chi quis, ehe quid; and lastly dulkisrna (Pisaur., 410), ofikina (Gallic vase, end of 6th century; see Romania, xiii. 485). Yet c before e, i must early have had a more palatal sound than before a, o, u, something like the old-fashioned English pronunciation kyard for card. But it was not until very late that the difference became so marked as to be expressed by different letters: the palatal sound began to be assibilated into something like Italian ce, ci, Eng. ch (as in child from Old Eng. cild}, about the 6th century, although perhaps not equally early everywhere. We find κeιτανe and tzitane (Ravenna charter, 591), and paze (inscr. about the same time). Ital. c = Eng. eh in pace, dieci (in Central Italy mostly pronounced sh∖ cielo; Span, paz, diez, cielo (lisping s from ts); Fr. cixl (Old ts, Mod. s).

1 3. E for accented ï became frequent. As original î and ï were no longer different in quantity, they had to be distinguished by quality; accordingly rnnum became Ital. vino, minus {minus, open i), Ital. meno, with the same vowel as in véna from vena ; thus Latin ï and e coalesced; likewise we have serivo scribo, bevo bïbo, sévo sébum, fido fidus, féde fïdes, eréde crédit, scritto scriptum, dette dictum.

We find traces of this in the Pomp, veces, Ital. vece. In Low Latin menus, fedes, Ac., are constant. But many who had a little more learning retained the Latin spelling minus, pronouncing meno{s), and by this were induced to write constantly i for close e, especially accented, as habire, vedire, crπ∕cre= Ital. avéré, vedére, crédere; vindere, stüla =véndere, stëlla, Ital. véndere, stélla, Piedm. esteila, Old Fr. esteile, Fr. étoile. In some few instances this may represent a provincial i, as in Sicil. aviri, or special cases like Fr. tenir, plaisir, merci.

4. Unaccented e for ï, which is frequent in Old Latin and not unfrequent in the post-classical age, returns in Low Latin with redoubled force. Thus we find fedelis (404), later Damenecus, sej>temus, decemus, ancma, deposeta, genetor, capete, soledοs ; in the Ravenna charters vecedomeno, vendecare, ordenαta, Ac.; in Frankish charters decemo, Fr. dime, Domeneeus, venerabelis, nobelis, lacrema, cantate, veretate, femena, ρlacetus, Ac. This penetrated even into Central Italy, as in the Tuscan Latin of the 8th century, dedet, placetum, homenis, inviolavelis. In Middle Italian uοrneni, in Modern Italian DomenedJte, ospedale, are rare remnants of the earlier form. Generally classical i has prevailed in Florentine and Italian, as «mi»!, femmina, anima, asino, online, spirite. In the Sienese dialect e has remained, as ordenare, cardenale, and in North Italian — Venet. δmeni, fèrnena, menèstra, brdene, dseno; Lomb. innen, asen, ordendri, Ac. In Spanish it is not unfrequent— ôrden, ûmedo, nove-ddd, corredôr ; comp. Prov. lagrema, semenar, conoissedor, and Old Fr. aneme, pronounced dnme (the spelling points to an older stage).

5. Unaccented medial e was often dropped, though less in Italian, except in the north, as in L. Lat. dulkisrna, dulcissima (Pisaur., 410), answering to modern Bomagnu∂lo forms like , sZrissm=illus-trissimo; generally L. Lat. domnus, domna—ltA. donna, “lady,” “woman.” In French all proparoxytones are contracted; for instance, Old Fr. (asinum, *as ’ no) asne âne, (anima, *an ’ ma) anmx âme, (hominem, *hom ’ ne) homme, (femina, *fem ’ na), ∕ewυne.

6. Accented o for m, not unfrequent in the preceding period, was constant in Low Latin. While Lat. lücem became Ital. luce, Lat. crucem, nucem {nucem, open u) became crôee, noce, like voce from vδcem ; comp, jùstus, Ital. giusto, Fr. juste, but augüstus, Ital. agôsto, Fr. août. This caused many to write u for close o, as oicwrβ uxore, geneture genitorem, although this may partly represent a provincial u, as in Sicil. amuri. In Old Fr. we have honour, favour, and still amour, and in L. Lat. curte =cohortem, *corte, Ital. corte, Fr. cour, Eng. court.

7. Unaccented o for ü as in Old Latin is frequent, as in L. Lat. tubola, popolo, secolom, ηgola, volontate, Ital. tdvola, popοlo, Ac.; even for original u, as mano, spirite.

8. Unaccented medial o was often dropped before l, in which case the unfamiliar group t’l was changed into el, as in L. Lat. oclus oculus, Ital. 6cchio, Span, ojo, Fr. ceil; veelus vetulus, Ital. vecchio (Old Ital. veglio∖ Span, vièjo, Fr. vieil, vieux; also L. Lat. tabla — Span, tabla, poplom= Span, puéblo. In French syncope is a law— table, peuple, sangle cingulum, Ac.

9. Final unaccented vowels in Italian on the whole obey the general laws. By the loss of the Latin final consonants all words end in a vowel, except such as per, con, non, in, un bel giorno, buon giomo. In South Italian i, u stand for e, o. In Spanish e is sometimes dropped, as sed sitim, Ital. séte; pared parietem, Ital. paréte; fdcil, 6rden. In Portuguese o is pronounced u, but often only whispered; e is nearly always whispered or mute. In North Italian, Ladino, Catalan, Provençal, and French all final vowels are generally dropped, except a, which remains in Provençal, as port, but porta (Mod. pδrte∖ In Catalan a is mostly pronounced as open e ; in French this becomes obscure e, which in modern French is mute except in such cases as table ronde.

10. Accented ie stands for é, uo for 8. As ë and ë, δ and δ were levelled in quantity, they were already distinguished in quality, as in Ital. bène bêne, véne vënae; Portuguese has got no further than this. But generally this was not distinct enough for the wants of the speakers, and unconsciously è (in which è from Lat. ae was included) became iè, and δ (in which i> from Lat. an was not included) became uδ, both diphthongs being generally accented on the last vowel—Ital. and Span, viène, Fr. vient venit; Ital. buδno, Span, budnο ; Ital. suδιw, Span, sueno (generally sonido} sonus, different from Ital. sδno sunt, Span. son. This change must be very old, as it is found in nearly all the Romance languages. In Spanish, Provençal, and French ui> was changed into ué, and this in Modern French to eu, oeu, contracted into the sound of o. In Spanish the use of diphthongs is extended to position— tiémpo, siete septem, Ital. sètte, hiérro, Ital. fèrro, ciiérpo, Ital. cδrpo, iiiuérte, Ital. morte. Mark the displacement of stress in popular Latin— pariétem for parietem, Ital. paréte, Span, pared, Fr. paroi; filiδlus for filiδlus, Ital. figliuδlo, Span, hijuélo, Fr. filleul.

11. Of mediae (voiced stops) for tenues (voiceless stops), especially between vowels, we find some few earlier instances, as grassus for crassus, Ital. grasso, Fr. gras. This is generally rare in Italian Latin, as gubitus, cubitus, Ital. gomito, and is still comparatively rare in Italian. Yet it occurs in some of the most familiar words, as ago acus, lago, luogo, segare,pagare (pacare, “to satisfy,”
[9:20:668]

“pay”), pregare, budello, parentado, contadο (comitatus), contrada, spada, strada; p from b becomes v, as in riva, riviera, povero, savio; before r—padre, madre, segreto, lebbra. This recalls similar changes in Umbrian, and was perhaps originally North Italian and from thence penetrated into Tuscany. In Spanish the voiced sounds are the general rule, as fuégo, Ital. fuòco, amigo, Ital. amico, amado, finido, Ital. amato, finito, sabér, Ital. sapére, &c., yet there are some exceptions, such as poco (paucum). In Old French the soft sound is the constant law, but this mostly disappears later, as in aimé, aimée (see France, vol. ix. p. 632 sq. ). A general Romance case is placitum, Old Ital. ρiaitο, Ital. piato, Span. pleito, Old Fr. plaid, through *plagito, *plajeto, which is singularly like the Umbrian feitu, feetu for façitu. A limited case is that of such words as Fr. raison, Ital. ragione from rationem, probably first changed to ratsió, *radsióne, thence to rasione, which sometimes occurs in Late Latin, and often in Early Italian, Span, razon ; comp. Ital. cagione occasionem.

12. I and e unaccented before vowels, especially post-tonic, became j, as filjus (Plautus), olium pron. οljo. J coalesced with the preceding consonant, making it palatal, as in Ital. figlio, oglio, figlia, maraviglia (mirabilia), battaglia ; Span, maraυilla, batalla; Fr. fille, merveille, bataille (in North French the palatal sound is replaced by i or j), &c. N —Ital. vigna vinea, Spagna Hispania, ingegno, castagna, campagna, bagnο balneum; Span. Espana, campa na; Fr. vigne, champagne. In some cases j was assibilated, as Span. granja, estranjero, Fr. songe, grange, étrange.

13. Sometimes attraction takes place, i being transposed to the radical syllable, especially in French, as huile, bain, témoin, Antoine, gloire, histoire. Before and after r peculiar forms appear—Ital. primaio (-70); muojo morior; Ital. primiero, cavaliere, from primario, probably assimilated into * primer(i)o (Dr Thomsen). Forms like pαner, sorcerus are found as early as the 8th century.

14. Vocabulary. — During this period the Roman world, after being conquered by the Germanic nations, adopted many words from their conquerors. The German influence was strongest in France; hence we find Germanic expressions for many of the most common words except form-words, though the stock of the language remains Latin. A curious instance, characteristic of the Middle Ages, is rauba, which from “robbery,” “prey,” came to mean “property,” Ital. roba ( robba ) , “things in general,” Span, ropa, “linen,” “stuff,” Fr. robe, “gown.” In Rumonsch we have la rauba c'aud a mi, “the property that belongs to me.” The German h, as in haïr , old hadir = “hate,” is peculiar to French, and is still sounded in Normandy. Some Germanic sounds had to be modified, as w to gu , for instance, guerra from werra, “war”; guanto, Old Fr. guant, Fr. gant, from want, Dan. Vante ; in North French w remained, whence Eng. war, &c. Among the leges barbarae, the Lex Salica is perhaps the most remarkable as a document of Low Latin. It has sentences and words like—hoc sunt pariculas causas=ce sont pareilles choses; si in dominica ambactia fuerit occupatus, Ital. ambasciata, Fr. ambassade; si quis alterum voluerit occidere et colpus praeter fallierit, Ital. se il colpo fallisce; si quis alterum de sagitta toxicata percutere voluerit et praeter sclupaverit (see stloppsιs, p. 665); si quis cabαllum extra consilium domini sui caballixaverit, Ital. caval-care, Fr. chevaucher; si quis per mal0 ingenio in curie (Ital. corte, Fr. cour) alterius aut in casa (Ital. casa, “house”) aliquid de furtzzτn miserit; eompanium, Ital. compagnia; bare, baronis, “a free man,” Old Fr. nom. ber, obj. baruη, “hero,” “baron”; diffaeere, Ital. disfare, Fr. défaire; exeortieare, Ital. scorticare, Fr. écorcher. From other laws we have— -fortia, Ital. forza, Fr. force; hostis exercitus, Eng. host; vassus (Celtic), “a vassal”; auca, Ital. δca, Fr. oie (from avixa); troppus, grex (from Germ, thorp∖ Ital. truppa, Fr. troupe, and also Ital. troppo, “too much,” Fr. trop; forestis (from foris), “ foreign,” Ital. forestiere; marea (Germ. ), “border,” whence mαrehensis, Ital. marchese, Fr. marquis; tornare (Greek; also Dacian Latin ^[5. The Greek historians Theophylact (c. 600) and Theophanes relate that the Dacian soldiers said in their native tongue τi>ρvα, τt>pva, φpaτρe, htτbpva. This has been called by some the earliest trace of Roumanian. ] ). Gregory of Tours (6th century) has ρageηsis, Ital. paése, Fr. pays. Gregory the Great has mercea, “mercy ”; fiasco, Ital. fiasco, “a flask.” Coripγus (Afr., c. 570): eara, ‘‘face” (Gr. κάρα, “head”), Span, cara, Old Fr. chixre, whence bonne chère, “good cheer” (originally the kind, hospitable countenance of the entertainer). Venantius Fortunatus (c. 580): eofea, “coif”; crema, “cream”; viaticum, Ital. viaggio, Fr. voyage. Other sources: eamiηus, “road” (Spanish Latin, 7th century; probably Celtic), Ital. cammino, Fr. chemin; directum, jus (Italian Latin, 551), Ital. diritto, Fr. droit. The late agrimensores: circαre, Ital. cercare, Fr. chercher. Old glosses (7th and 8th centuries): αeiarium, Ital. acciaio, Fr. acier; cosinus, consobrinus, Ital. cugino, Fr. cousin; gamba, Ital. gamba, Fr. jambe (Gloss. Cass. ). Isidore: trudα, Fr. truite, Eng. trout; cama, Span, eama, “bed”; fieatum, “liver” (properly jeeurfixαtum, liver of geese fed with figs), Ital. fégato, Span, higado, Fr. foie; and eusire, consuere, Ital. cuscire, cucire, Span, coser, Fr. coudre (Gloss. Isid. ); selvatieus, Ital. sel-vaggio, Fr. sauvage; formaticum, Ital. formaggio, Fr. fromage.

VI. Sixth (Last) Period.

For the sixth and last period—that is, for the history and distinctive traits of the great modern Romance languages —the reader is referred to the separate articles.

1. Italian is distinguished by its harmonious form, its vocalic endings, and the rich fulness of its tones.

2. Spanish is distinguished by its regularity, by its short, distinct sounds and its fixed tones, and by many Arabic words. Certain “thick” sounds, as the j (like Dutch and South German ch, though in the south of Spain much weaker, almost Λ) and the lisping c, z seem to be rather modern developments than due to direct Arabic influence.

3. Portuguese is, with Gallego (the dialect of Galicia), the western dialect of Spanish, and has almost the same words, but a very different pronunciation; in sound it approaches somewhat to French, as in the nasal vowels (which, however, are less purely vocalic than in French) and the voiced sounds of s, 2, and j. It has partly retained the Old Spanish form, as in filho for Span, hijo, and partly it has a character of its own owing to its many obscured vowels and contractions, as boa for bona, dor for dolor.

4. Provençal in many respects represents the earliest form of French; in others it has peculiar developments (see Provençal). Catalan is the southern dialect of Provençal.

5. French makes up for the want of the full forms and tones of Italian by its grace and delicacy. It has more of a history than the other Romance languages, Old French being very different from Modern.

6. Ladino (Rumonsch, ^[6. Rumonsch is properly the dialect of the upper Rhine valley, Ladino that of the Engadine. Ascoli includes all varieties under the common name of Ladino. ] Germ. Churwαlsch, from the town of Chur) or Central Romance extends from the Grisons to Friuli on the Adriatic. It is not uniform, being only an agglomeration of cognate dialects; and it is scarcely more Latin than any other Romance language. It has chiefly been elucidated by Ascoli.

7. Roumanian has probably not survived from the old Roman colonists of Dacia, but been imported from Istria (which has a cognate dialect) or Northern Italy. It has been greatly mixed up with Slavonic words and sounds (such as the “mixed” vowels), and has some distinctive marks, such as the post-positive article, Romunul = Romanus ille; compare the similar phenomenon in the Slavonic dialect of Bulgaria and in the Albanian language.

Literature.— The real founder of scientific Romance philology and linguistics is Friedrich Diez, in his Grammatik der romanischen Sprachen, 3 vols., Bonn, 1836-42, and Etymologisches Wörterbuch der romanischen Sprachen, 2 vols., 1852. He also published Altro∙ manische Sprachdenkmäler, 1846; Zwei altromanischc Gedichte, 1852; and AUromanisehe Glossare, 1865. Pott contributed several articles on the Low Latin of the leges barbarae in the Zeitschriften of Hofer and Kuhn. Other authorities on various branches of the subject are—Ducange, Glossarium mediae et infirnae latinitαtis, 7 vols.; Marini, Papiri diplomatiei ; Muratori, Antiquitates Italieae-, Schuchardt, Der Voealismus des Vulgärlateins, 3 vols., 1866-68 (a valuable collection of materials), also several minor works by the same author; and Gaston Paris, Étude sur le Rôle de l'Accent Latin dans la Längste Française, Paris, 1862, and La Vie de St Alexis (a poem of 11th century), 1872. The principal magazines devoted to the subject are— Jahrbuch für romanische und englische Literatur (ed. Wolff, Ebert, and Lembcke), later only für romanische Literatur; Archiv für das Studium der neueren Sprachen (ed. Herrig), of a more popular character; Romania (a quarterly, cd. Gaston Paris and Paul Meyer, since 1872), contains articles of the most eminent Romanists; Revue des Langues Romanes (Montpellier, from 1870 onwards), chiefly devoted to Provençal; Romanische Studien (ed. Boehmer); Zeitschrift für romanische Philologie (ed. Gröber, since 1877); and Romanische Forschungen (ed. Vollmöller, since 1884). Mussafia has written many articles and treatises, chiefly in the Transadions of the Vienna Academy of Sciences. Ascoli, author of Studi Critici, has edited since 1873 the Archivio Glottologieo, which has articles by Flecchia. The Rivista di Filologia Romαnza (ed. Manzoni, Monaci, and Stengel, 1873) in 1878 became Giornαle di Filologia Romαnza (ed. Monaci). For the etymological dictionaries of the separate languages see the special articles. (J. ST.*)
