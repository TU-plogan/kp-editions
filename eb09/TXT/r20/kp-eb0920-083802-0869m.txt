ROMFORD an old market-town of Essex, is situated on the small river Rom, and on the Great Eastern Railway about 12 miles east-north-east of London. The ancient church of St Edward the Confessor was replaced in 1850 by a structure in the Late Decorated style. The large brewery of Inde, Coope, & Co. is situated in the town, and there are extensive market gardens in the neighbourhood.
