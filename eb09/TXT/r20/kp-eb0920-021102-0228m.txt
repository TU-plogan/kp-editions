RADETZKYJohann־ J. W. A. F. C., Count of Radetz (1766-1858), field-marshal of Austria, was born at Trzebnitz in Bohemia in 1766, to the nobility of which province his family belonged. He entered a cavalry regiment in 1784 and served under Joseph II. and Laudon against the Turks in 1788 and 1789. In 1793 his regiment was sent to the lower Rhine, and from this time onwards Radetzky was engaged in the wars which were continued (with intermission) between Austria and France for the next twenty years. In 1796 he was adjutant to General Beaulieu, over whom Bonaparte won his first victories in Italy. In 1799, when the Austrians with Suwaroffs help reconquered Northern Italy, he distinguished himself at the battles of Novi and the Trebbia, displaying, according to the despatches of General Mêlas, great presence of mind in the midst of extreme danger. After the defeat of Marengo he was removed from Italy to Germany, and there took part in the still more disastrous engagement of Hohenlinden. In 1805 Radetzky, now major-general, was back in Italy, serving under the archduke Charles in the successful campaign of Caldiero, the fruits of which were lost by Mack’s capitulation at Ulm and the fall of Vienna. In 1809 he fought at Wagram. In 1813, when all the great powers of Europe combined against Napoleon, Radetzky was chief of the staff under Schwarzenberg, the Austrian commander-in-chief of the allied forces, and he now gained a reputation outside his own country. The plan of the battle of Leipsic is said to have been in great part Radetzky’s work, and in this engagement he was wounded. He entered Paris with the allied sovereigns in March 1814, and returned with them to the congress of Vienna, where he appears to have acted as an intermediary between Metternich and the czar Alexander, when these great personages were not on speaking terms. During the succeeding years of peace he disappeared from the public view and narrowly escaped being pensioned off in 1829. The insurrection of the Papal Legations in 1831 brought him, however, into active service again; and on the retirement of General Frimont he was placed in command of all the Austrian forces in Italy, receiving in 1836 the dignity of field-marshal. Radetzky was now seventy years old, but twelve more years were to pass before the really historical part of his career opened. When he was eighty-two the revolution of 1848 broke out. Milan rose in insurrection against its Austrian rulers, and after a struggle of five days Radetzky was forced to evacuate the city. Unable to retain any hold on Lombardy, he concentrated his troops at Verona, the fortifications of which were to a great extent his own creation. Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, now declared war upon Austria, occupied Milan, and laid siege to Peschiera. Radetzky, after the arrival of reinforcements, moved southwards to Mantua, and attempted from that point to turn the Sardinian flank; he was, however, defeated on the Mincio, and Peschiera fell into the enemy’s hands. Radetzky, nevertheless, was secure in the possession of Verona and Mantua; and, after being still further reinforced, he resumed the offensive in July, defeated the Sardinians at Cus-tozza and in several other encounters, and advanced victoriously upon Milan, where, on 6th August, an armistice was concluded, the Sardinian army retiring behind the Ticino. During the succeeding months, while Vienna and the central provinces of the Austrian empire appeared likely to fall into anarchy, Radetzky’s army remained firm in its loyalty to the old order of things, and declined to enter [9:20:212]into relations with the democratic leaders. It was in fact at this time the mainstay of the house of Hapsburg, while everything around the central government tottered; and, when the restoration of authority began, and the young emperor Francis Joseph ascended the throne that had been vacated by his imbecile predecessor, Radetzky gave to the new monarch the prestige of a crushing victory over his Italian enemies. The armistice was denounced by Charles Albert on the 12th of March 1819. On the 20th Radetzky crossed the Ticino at Pavia, and on the 23d he annihilated the Italian army at Novara. Peace followed this brief and decisive campaign, and for the next eight years Radetzky governed upper Italy. He retired from service in 1857, and died at the age of ninety-two in the following year. Radetzky was idolized by the Austrian army, but his reputation as a general has not survived him.
