REEVEClara (1725-1803), one of the imitators of Horace Walpole in Gothic romance, was born at Ipswich in 1725. She was an industrious woman of letters, and produced many works in prose and verse, including an interesting sketch of the Progress of Romance ; but her only eminent success was the romance of The Old English Baron (1777). In her theory about the use of the supernatural, as in chronological position, she stands midway between Walpole and Mrs Radcliffe. Though she owned Walpole as a master, she declined to follow as far as he went in supernatural incident; she admits a castle and a haunted wing and the ghost of a murdered man, but draws the line before statues dropping blood, pictures that groan and walk out of their frames, and suchlike improbabilities. She was the daughter of a Suffolk clergyman, and died at Ipswich in 1803.
