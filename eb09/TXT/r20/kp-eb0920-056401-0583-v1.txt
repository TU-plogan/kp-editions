RIO GRANDE DO SUL or in full Säo Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul, a city of Brazil, in the province of the same name, near the mouth of the estuary of Rio Grande. Including the suburbs it is a place of from 30,000 to 35,000 inhabitants (1880), with a considerable trade and various manufactures. The bar at the mouth of the “Rio” does not admit vessels of full 10-feet draught; but dredging operations undertaken by the Government in 1882 are considerably increasing the depth. In 1881-84 a railway was constructed from Rio Grande do Sul to Bage, 125 miles inland. The average annual value of the imports in the six official years ending June 30, 1882, was about £589,043, reckoning the milreis at 2s. In 1881 651 vessels (133,779 tons) crossed the bar inwards, and 555 (133,276) outwards. Among the foreign vessels the British are most numerous. The imports are very various, to supply the colonies of Germans, Italians, &c., settled throughout the province; the exports on the other hand are mainly hides, skins, bones, hair, tallow, &c.

Rio Grande do Sul was a long time the chief town of the captaincy of El Rei (which included both the present province of Rio Grande do Sul and that of Santa Catharina). It was first founded as an encampment of Portuguese troops in 1737 on the south side of the Rio Grande. The settlement was removed to its present site by Gomes Ereire d’Andrade in 174δ. The Spaniards occupied this part of the country from 1763 to 1776. In 1807 the two districts of Sào Pedro and Santa Catharina were united and erected into a province with Sào José de Porto Alegre for its chief town; and, though Rio Grande was declared a city in 1809, Porto Alegre retained its position even after the separation into two comarcas in 1812. The name of the province has been rendered familiar in Europe through the remarkable success which has attended the establishment of German and Italian agricultural colonies. In 1872 there were 36,458 foreigners in the province to 330,564 freeborn Brazilians and 67,791 slaves; and by 1882 it was estimated that the German population alone amounted to 102,000, while the Italians, who began to immigrate in 1875, were rapidly approaching 50,000. The first German settlement was that of Sào Leopoldo on the Rio do Sino, founded by Dorn Pedro I. in 1825. By 1830 the inhabitants numbered 5000, and in 1854 the town was made a municipium. Others of the same nationality are Novo Mundo (1850), Nova Petropolis (1858), Santa Maria da Soledade, Marato, Sào Benedicto, Sào Salvador, Montenegro, Feliz, Teutonia (1858), Estrella (1856), Santa Cruz (1849), Mont Alverne, Germania, Sào Lorenzo (1858), Santa Clara, Säo Silvano, Domingos, &c. The principal Italian colonies are Caxias, Conde d’Eu, Donna Isabel, and Sil viera Martins, which in 1884 had respectively 13,680, 6287, 9595, and 6000 inhabitants. The success of these colonies is one of the most important elements in the development of the Brazilian empire.
