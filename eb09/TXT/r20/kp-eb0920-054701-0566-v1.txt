RICIMER created “comes” of the empire under Valentinian III., was the son of a chief of the Suevi, who had married a daughter of Wallia king of the Visigoths. He was brought up at Valentinian’s court, and served with distinction under Aetius. In 456 a decisive naval victory over the Vandals off Corsica, followed soon afterwards by the defeat of their land forces near Agrigentum, earned for him the title of “Deliverer of Italy” and brought him within sight of the goal of his ambition. Having vanquished and deposed the emperor Avitus in October of that year, he for some time exercised every function of sovereignty over Italy under the title of “patrician,” which he received from Leo in February 457. Precluded by his barbarian origin from aspiring to the imperial title, he consented to the elevation of Majorian in April 457, but, encouraged by the misfortunes of that brave but simple-minded soldier, he was equally ready to force his deposition four years afterwards (August 461). The puppet on whom the imperial dignity was now bestowed was Libius Severus, but Ricimer continued to command armies, negotiate alliances, and wield an independent and despotic authority over the Italian peninsula, although his power throughout the rest of the Western empire was practically neutralized by the influence of Marcellinus in Dalmatia and Aegidius in Gaul. When Anthemius, invested with the purple by Leo, arrived at [9:20:548]Rome in 467, Ricimer was politic enough to acquiesce with a good grace, and was rewarded by being made the son-in-law of the new emperor; but subsequently a quarrel with his father-in-law occasioned his withdrawal to Milan, whence he marched at the head of an army upon Rome, which he besieged and sacked, Anthemius being among the slain (July 11, 472). Olybrius was next made emperor at the instance of the Roman “kingmaker,” who died of a malignant fever on August 18, 472.
