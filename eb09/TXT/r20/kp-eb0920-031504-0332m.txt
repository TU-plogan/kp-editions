REDRUTH a market town of Cornwall, is pleasantly situated on the West Cornwall Railway, about 9 miles west of Truro. It is almost the centre of the mining district of West Cornwall, and, though many of the rich copper mines are now abandoned, others have proved rich in tin at greater depths, and new mines have also been opened, sufficient to render Redruth one of the most busy and important towns of the county. Within the last few years a post-office, a mining exchange, and a school of science and art have been built, as well as a new church. At the foot of Carn Brea, the unique Druidical hill, surmounted by masses of granite, with an ancient castle and [9:20:316]monument to Lord de Dunstanville, is the parish church dedicated to St Uny, with a fine old 15th-century tower and peal of bells. The industries include brewing, tinsmelting, making of safety fuses, and iron-founding. Besides the market-house, there are a granite town-hall, a masonic hall, and the public rooms with Druids’ Hall. At the west end of the town is the West Cornwall Miners’ Hospital (thirty beds), erected by Lord Robartes in 1863 and since added to by the same nobleman. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 4006 acres) in 1871 was 10,685, and in 1881 it was 9335.
