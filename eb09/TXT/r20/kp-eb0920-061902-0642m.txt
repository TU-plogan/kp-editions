ROE or Row, Sir Thomas (1568 7-1644), an eminent political agent of the reigns of James I. and Charles I., was born in 1568 (?) at Low Leyton near Wanstead in Essex (being a grandson of Sir Thomas Roe, a well-known lord mayor of London). He was entered as a commoner at Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1593, but shortly afterwards he left the university and, having read for the bar, became esquire of the body to Queen Elizabeth. From James I. he received the honour of knighthood in 1604, and in 1609 he was sent by Prince Henry on a mission to the West Indies, during which he visited Guiana and the river Amazons. As member of parliament in 1614 he supported the principles of Sandys and Whitelocke. His permanent reputation was mainly secured by the success which attended his embassy in 1615-18 to the court at Agra of the Great Mogul (Jahangir, son of Akbar), whose importance had been made known by Sir John Hawkins, —the principal object of the mission being to obtain the protection of an English factory at Surat. Sir Thomas Roe’s Journal, reprinted in a more or less complete shape in the collections of Purchas, Pinkerton, and Kerr, forms one of the leading authorities for the reign of Jahangir. Appointed ambassador to the Porte in 1621, he filled this difficult position under Osman, Mustapha, and Amurat; and after his return from the East he continued to be employed on various political missions to Poland, Denmark, and other European courts, till in 1641 he was sent by Charles I. to the diet of Ratisbon. Roe died in 1644.

The Society for the Encouragement of Learning proposed to publish a whole series of Roe’s papers, but owing to lack of funds only one of the five volumes, edited by Samuel Richardson, ever saw the light— The Negotiations of Sir Thomas Roe in his Embassy to the Ottoman Forte, 1621-1628 (London, 1740). In regard to his minor publications and manuscript remains see Wood’s Athenae Oxonienses; Allibone’s Dictionary of British . . . Authors·, and Notes and Queries, vii., viii., ix., and xi. (2d ser.).
