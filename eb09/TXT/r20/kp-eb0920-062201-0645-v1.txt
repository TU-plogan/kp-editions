+=====================================================================+


ROHAN Henri de (1579-1638), a general and writer of eminence and one of the last and best representatives of the independent French noblesse, was born at the château of Bleins in Brittany on 21st August 1579. His father was René IL, count of Rohan, and head of a family which had hardly a superior in France for antiquity and distinction, and which was connected with most of the reigning houses of Europe. Rohan was by birth the second son, but his elder brother René dying young he became the heir of the name. He appeared at court and in the army at the age of sixteen, and was a special favourite with Henry IV., after whom, failing the house of Condé, he ∙ might be said to be the natural chief of the French Protestants. Having served till the peace of Vervins, he travelled for a considerable time over Europe, including England and Scotland, in the first of which countries he received the not unique honour of being called by Elizabeth her knight, while in the second he was godfather at Charles I.’s christening. On his return to France he was made duke and peer at the age of twenty-four and married Marguerite de Béthune, Sully’s daughter, receiving lucrative appointments. After the assassination of Henry IV., which was a great blow to him, Rohan fought with success at the siege of Jülich. But from this time onwards he was for the greater part of many years either in active warfare against the Government of his country, or in active though peaceable opposition to it. For a time, however, he abstained from actual insurrection, and he endeavoured to keep on terms with Marie de’ Medici; he even, despite his dislike of De Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII., reappeared in the army and fought in Lorraine and Piedmont. It was not till the decree for the restitution of church property in the south threw the Bearnese and Gascons into open revolt that Rohan appeared as a rebel. His authority and military skill were very formidable to the royalists, forced them among other checks to raise the siege of Montauban, and brought about the treaty of Montpellier (1623). But Rohan did not escape the results of the incurable factiousness which showed itself more strongly perhaps among the French Huguenots than among any other of the numerous armed oppositions of the 17th century. He was accused of lukewarmness and treachery, though he did not hesitate to renew the war when the compact of Montpellier was broken. Again a hollow peace was patched up, but it lasted hardly any time, and Rohan undertook a third war, the first the events of which are recounted in his celebrated Memoirs. This last war (famous for the siege of La Rochelle, in which, however, Rohan’s brother Soubise, not Rohan himself, was principally concerned) was one of considerable danger for Rohan: he was condemned to death, and a great reward was offered for him dead or alive. Nor at the close of the war did he think it best to remain in France, but made his way to Venice. Here he lived quietly for some time and is said to have received from the Porte the offer of the sovereignty of Cyprus. It is more certain that his hosts of Venice wished to make him their general-in-chief, a design not executed owing to the peace of Cherasco (1631). Soon afterwards Rohan was again called to serve his lawful sovereign. Richelieu had had experience, though not friendly experience, of his abilities, and when France began once more to take a vigorous part in the Thirty Years’ War Rohan was appointed to the task of occupying the Valtelline, and thus cutting off the communication between Germany and Italy. He was entirely successful and repeatedly beat both the imperialists and the Spaniards. But, despite this service, Rohan was still thought dangerous to the peace of France owing to his influence with the Huguenots, and objection was even made to his residence in Geneva. He therefore joined Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, and was serving in his army when he met with the wound which caused his death at Rheinfelden on l4th March 1638. His body was buried at Geneva and his arms solemnly bequeathed to and accepted by the Venetian republic. Rohan’s wife was a woman of talent and energy, though she did not escape scandal. His younger brother Benjamin, generally known as Soubise, was, like him, a famous Huguenot leader. His daughter and only recognized surviving child, named Marguerite, carried the honours of Rohan into the Chabot family.

What has chiefly preserved Rohan’s memory is not his military achievements, though they were remarkable, nor his political position, though it was high, but his admirable J/eznoirs. These cover the civil wars in three books, while a fourth contains the narrative of the Valtelline campaigns; and they rank among the best products of the singular talent for memoir-writing which the French aristocracy of the 16th and 17th centuries possessed. Alike in style, in clearness of matter, and in shrewdness of thought they deserve very high praise. The first three books appeared in 1644, that on the Valtelline War not till 1758. Some suspicions were thrown on the genuineness of this latter, but it would seem groundlessly. Rohan also wrote Le Parfait Capitaine, an adaptation of the military precepts and examples of Caesar to modern warfare; an account of his travels; a political tract, L'Intérêt des États et des Princes de la Chrétienté, &c. The Memoirs, which alone have continued to bo reprinted, may be conveniently found in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, voL xix.
