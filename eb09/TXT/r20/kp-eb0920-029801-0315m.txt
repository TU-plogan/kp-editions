RÁWAL PINDÍ or Rawul Pindee, a district of British India, in the division of the same name, ^[1. Rawal Pindi division comprises the four districts of Rawal Pindi, Jhelum, Gujrat, and Shahpur, with a total area of 15,435 square miles and a total population (1881) of 2,520,508 (males 1,346,573, females 1,173,935). ] under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, lying between 33° and 34° N. lat. and 71° 46'and 73° 41' E. long. It is situated on the southern slopes of the northwestern extremities of the Himalayas, and contains large mountain tracts, with rich valleys traversed by many mountain torrents. Its area is 4861 square miles; it is bounded on the N. by Hazdra district, on the E. by the river Jhelum, on the S. by Jhelum district, and on the W. by the Indus. From its north-eastern extremity to its western limits the district is traversed by hills more or less linked together, causing those peculiarities of surface and of climate by which it is distinguished. The eastern range, known locally as the Murree (Marri) Hills, from the sanatorium erected at the north-eastern extremity of the district, is a continuation of the great Himalayan system; it descends in a southerly and westerly direction, and is clothed with magnificent forest trees and a rich undergrowth of brushwood. Southward these hills follow the course of the Jhelum, decreasing in height, but gaining in picturesqueness what they lose in sublimity, until they subside into a comparatively level country. The mountains in the western half of the district belong to the trans-Indus system; the chief range, known as the Chitta Pahar or White Hills, is composed chiefly of nummulitic limestone. To the north lies the fertile valley of Chach, one of the rare oases which relieve the wildness of this savage waste. The Indus and the Jhelum are the chief rivers of Rdwal Pindi. The former bounds the district along its whole western edge, where it is very picturesque, and in parts navigable for steamers; the latter, forming the eastern frontier, is equally picturesque though less important for navigation. Other chief rivers are the Sohan and the Haroh, both tributaries of the Indus. The climate of R&wal Pindi is noted for its salubrity; the mean annual temperature is 69°4־, and the average annual rainfall 33T5 inches. The Punjab Northern State Railway runs through its whole length, with a branch from Golra junction, north of the town of RAwal Pindi, to Khusalgari on the western frontier.

The population in 1881 was 820,512 (males 449,287, females 371,225), Hindus numbering 86,162, Mohammedans 711,546, Sikhs 17,780, Christians 3822, and “others” 202. The only town with a population exceeding 10,000 is the capital (see below). The inhabitants are mostly scattered in small hamlets over the surface of the country. The staple product is wheat in the spring and bajra in the autumn. Inferior grains are giving place to more valuable cereals, and to cotton and potatoes. Of the total area 1517 square miles are cultivated and 379 cultivable. Owing to the nigged nature of the country there is very little commerce, and that little is concentrated principally at the headquarters town. Imports consist of sugar, spices, cotton goods, and salt; while exports are confined to the raw materials of agriculture. The only manufacture of any importance is cotton-weaving. The total revenue of the district in 1882-83 was £105,316, of which the land-tax yielded £68,715.

Rawal Pindi with the rest of the Sikh dominions passed to the British in 1849, under whose administration it enjoyed comparative peace until the mutiny in 1857. The events of that year afforded an outlet for the smouldering passions engendered by ancestral feuds, and the Murree Hills became the scene of an attempted insurrection. The authorities, however, having been warned of this by a faithful native, took steps for defence, so that when the enemy arrived they were compelled to withdraw in disorder, and they shortly afterwards disbanded themselves. Since then the district has remained comparatively tranquil. Among recent events is the great durbar held by the viceroy of India (Earl Dufferin) on 8th April 1885 in honour of the amir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman). The district abounds in objects of great antiquarian interest, chief of which are those of Dehri Shahan (or Shall Dheri), a village situated in 33° 17' N. lat. and 72° 49' E. long. Dehri Shahan has been identified with the site of the ancient city of Taxila or Takshasila, which in the time of Alexander was “a large and wealthy city, the most populous between the Indus and Hydaspes” (Jhelum). The ruins of Taxila consist of several distinct portions, and rank as the most interesting, extensive, and best preserved memorials of antiquity in the Punjab province.
