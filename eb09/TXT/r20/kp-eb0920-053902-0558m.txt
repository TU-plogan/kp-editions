RICH Claudius James (1787-1821), Eastern traveller and scholar, was born near Dijon, March 28, 1787. While still an infant he was taken to Bristol, where he spent his youth. At a very early age he developed a wonderful capacity for the acquisition of languages, soon becoming familiar not only with Latin and Greek but also with Hebrew, Syriac, Persian, Turkish, and other Eastern tongues. His unusual intelligence and extraordinary acquirements in Oriental languages procured for him in 1803 a nomination to a writership in the Bombay establishment of the East India Company. In 1804 Rich proceeded to Constantinople, where, and at Smyrna, he stayed a considerable time, perfecting himself in the Turkish language. Proceeding to Alexandria as assistant to the British consul-general there, he devoted himself to Arabic and its various dialects, and made himself master of Eastern manners and usages. On leaving Egypt he proceeded by land to the Persian Gulf, disguised as a Mameluke, visiting Damascus, and entering the great mosque undetected. At Bombay, which he reached in September 1807, he was the guest of Sir James Mackintosh, whose eldest daughter he married in January 1808, proceeding soon after to Baghdad as resident. While gaining the respect of Turks of all classes, as well as of Europeans, he now began his investigations into the geography, history, and antiquities of the vastly interesting region in the midst of which he was placed, the results of which give him a high place among Eastern students. He made collections of all kinds, visited and examined the remains of Babylon, and projected a geographical and statistical account of the pashalic of Baghdad. The results of his investigations at Babylon appeared first in the Vienna serial the Mines dx l ’ Oment, and in 1811 in England, under the title Narrative of a Journey to the Site of Babylon in 1811. In 1839 this was republished by his widow, with Major Rennell’s remarks upon it, and a second memoir by Rich in reference to these remarks, together with the narrative of a journey to Persepolis. In 1813-14 Rich spent some time in Europe, and on his return to Baghdad paid special attention to the geography of Asia Minor, and collected much information in Syrian and Chaldaean convents concerning the Yezzidis. He continued, too, to collect manuscripts of all kinds, his collections being probably the most extensive and valuable brought together by any private person up to that time. His collection of coins—Greek, Parthian, Sasanian, and Moslem—as well as of gems and engraved stones, was much enlarged. During this period he made a second excursion to Babylon, and in 1820 he undertook an extensive tour to Kurdistan—from Baghdad north to Sulimania, eastward to Sinna, then west to Nineveh, and thence down the Tigris to Baghdad. The narrative of this journey, which for the first time furnished accurate knowledge (from scientific observation) regarding the topography and geography of the region traversed, was published by his widow in 1836. It abounds with information on the country and the people, their history and traditions, the ruins and inscriptions met with, characterized by the profundity and thoroughness of the real scholar and trained observer. He visited many of the ancient Christian churches in Chaldaea, adding largely to his stock of manuscripts, including ancient Syrian and Chaldaean versions of the Scriptures. In 1821 Rich went to Basora, whence he made an excursion to Shiraz, visiting the ruins of Persepolis and the other remains of antiquity in the neighbourhood. An account of these excursions is given in the posthumous publication referred to, which also contains many notes on Rich’s collections and minor excursions as well as a brief memoir. At Shiraz he was struck down by cholera on October 5, 1821. His early death was a vast loss to Oriental investigation. The work he did accomplish was of great value for Eastern archaeology and history.
