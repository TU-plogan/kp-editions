REUS a town of Spain, in the province of Tarragona, is situated at the foot of a chain of hills in a fertile plain about four miles from the sea. It is connected by rail with Tarragona, 9∣ miles to the east, and with Lerida, 54J miles to the north-west. It consists of two parts, the old and the new, separated by the boulevard-like Calle

Arrabal, which occupies the site of the old wall, some vestiges of which still remain: the old town centres in the Plaza del Mercado, from which narrow and tortuous lanes radiate in various directions; the new dates from about the middle of the 18th century, and its streets are wide and straight. The public buildings have no special architectural or historical interest, but the view from the tower of the church of San Pedro is exceptionally fine. Réus, next to Barcelona itself, is the most flourishing manufacturing centre in Catalonia, the staples being silk and cotton; imitations of French wines are also extensively made, and the miscellaneous industries include tanning, distilling, and the like. The cotton factories exceed eighty in number, and one of them employs upwards of six hundred hands. Most of the traffic of Réus passes through the comparatively sheltered port of Salou, four miles distant. The population of Réus in 1877 was 27,595.

The earliest records of Réus date from about the middle of the 13th century. Its modern prosperity is traced to about the year 1750, when a colony of English settled there and established a trade in woollens, leather, wine, and spirits. The principal incidents in its political history arose out of the occurrences of 1843, in connexion with which the “villa” became a “ciudad” and Generals Zurbano and Prim each received the title of count of Réus.
