RASHBAM. Rabbenu Shemuel Ben Meer, commonly called, from his title and the initials of his own and his father’s names, Rashbam, was born at Rameru (Ramerupt near Troyes, in France) about 1080. He was almost the greatest Talmudist of his time, the only two excelling him till 1105 being Rashi and later on his own younger brother, Rabbenu Ya'akob, better known as Rabbenu Tham. In Bible criticism and exegesis, however, he excelled all the men of the 11th and 12th centuries, even if we include R. Menahem b. Helbo, R. Yoseph Bekhor Shor, and R. Yoseph Kara of the Franco-Ashkenazic school, and Abraham Ibn 'Ezra of the Sepharadic school. Rashbam was the son of Yokhebed, second daughter of Rashi (q.v.), and of Rabbenu Meir of Rameru (b. Shemuel). He sue-ceeded his grandfather Rashi as head of the Rabbinical college, and probably also of the congregation, of Troyes. Later, however, we meet him at other places, e.g., Caen, Loudun. He died about 1160.

Of his works the following are known. (1) Commentaries on the Bible: (a) his commentary on the Pentateuch, uncritically edited several times (ed. princeps, Berlin, 1705), and critically and most ably for the first time by Rosin of Breslau (1881, 8vo); ( b) commentaries on most of the other books of the Bible, the greater part of which are now lost, but the existence of which is in early times fully testified to. Those on Ecclesiastes and Canticles ^[1. The present writer cannot share the opinion of those who, because of the Agadic explanations with which that commentary abounds, call Rashbam’s authorship in question. Ibn ’Ezra himself, who was sober thinker enough, is compelled in Canticles to resort to the Rabbinic explanation,—a proceeding and a method in which every modern commentator must take refuge, unless he wishes to explain the book as a merely profane one. ] were published by Dr Jellinek at Leipsic (1855, 8vo); specimens of both books have been translated into English by Dr Ginsburg (Song of Songs, London, 1857, and Coheleth, London, 1861). (2) Com-

mentaries on the Babylonian Talmud; of these we now possess only his supplements on Pesahim (leaves 99b-121b), Baba Bathrd (leaves 29a-176b), and Makkoth (leaves 19b sq.; see the so-called Rashi on the Riph, in the Mishnah, iii. 5, catchword ¡ועל הזק). Commentaries on five other treatises are distinctly referred to by old authorities, ^[2. See Berliner Magazin, &c., vii. 186, and Or Zarua, in several places (comp. Magazin, ii. p. 100). ] but Rashi’s commentaries so thoroughly eclipsed all those written before and after him that none of them had a chance of surviving, except in the shape of a supplement. (3) Additamenta or Tosaphoth ; see Rabbinovicz (variae lectiones), ii.,
[9:20:284]

Preface, p. 13, and Steinsclineider, Hebr. Hnndschr. in der kon. Bib. Berlin, p. 3. (4) Response¡, ; see, for example, Raban (Prague,

1610, folio), leaves 143, col. 2, to 146b, col. 1, and elsewhere. (5) Of his controversies with Christians nothing is left except what is occasionally to be found in his commentary on the Pentateuch. (6) On his book on the calendar calculations see Berliner Magazin, vii. p. 185. (7) On the true author of the commentary on Aboth, ascribed to Rashbam, see Taylor, Catal., No. 20. (8) Although the attack on his hemero-nyction theory (commentary on Gen. i. 4, 5) was made by Ibn ’ Ezra ( Iggcreth Hasshabbath ; see Kercm Hcmcd, iv. pp. 159173־, and Mibhar Hammaamarim by Nathan b. Shemuel, printed at Leghorn in 1840, leaves 58a66־a) in Rash-barn’s lifetime he seems not to have answered it. (S. M. S.-S.)
