RIPH ( f l ,f '"∣ or c l"^'^J), t.e., Rabbenu Yishak b. Ya'akob Hakkohen ^[1. That Riph was a Kohen, or Aaronite, will be seen from the epitaph given in Haggαlwth Hariρh in the collection Turnrnαth Yesharirn (Venice, 1622, fol. ). ] Al-phasi or Al-fezi, after the death of his teachers the greatest rabbi of Africa, and subsequently of the Peninsula, in the llth and l2th centuries, was born in 1013 at KaΓat-Ibn-Hammad near Fez, and died at Lucena in 1103. His teachers were the great rabbins Rabbenu Nissim and Rabbenu Hananeel, both of Kairawan ( ob . 1055). What Rashi (ç.v.) was to the Ashkenazic Riph was for the Sepharadic Jews, ^[2. On these names see Mλhzor, vol. xv. ρ. 293. ] not only a teacher of the deepest learning, but also one who made new paths altogether for the students of the Talmud. Otherwise these tw τ o great men differed widely from one another in their activity. Rashi left the Babylonian Talmud, corrections of the text excepted (which he, however, confined to his own commentary, and by which his own disciples and publishers corrected the Talmud text), in its old state. Al-phasi, however, first separated from it the Agadah, which he cast aside almost entirely, and then he sifted the Hala-khah ^[3. On these terms see Midrasπ, vol. xvi. p. 285, and Misπnλh, p. 503. ] thoroughly, retaining only the practical part of it. Thus either title his book has received is correct, the Little Talmud or the Decisions of Rab Al-phez. Late in the 12th century and in the 13th a host of rabbins respectively attacked and defended Al-phasi (see Rabad III., and Rλmban), whilst others commented on him (see below). One of the commentaries accompanying the Riph is by Rashi. This commentary, however, which is now an integral part of the book, was not written for it by Rashi himself, who could scarcely have known of Riph’s existence, and much less of his work. The fact is the enterprising publisher of the second edition (Venice, 1521-22, fol.), the famous Daniel Bombergi, had one of the three recensions which Rashi had made on the Talmud excerpted and applied to corresponding parts of the Riph which has the very wording of the Talmud, or something near it. Where no Rashi was to be found in the passages of the [9:20:567]Talmud (see Rashi) Rashbam (7.u) was utilized. Riph was not only a great Talmudist, but also a man of the greatest magnanimity and highest morality, as may be seen from the following two facts. When R. Yishak Ibn Albalia, who had been his bitterest enemy, lay at the point of death, he recommended his son to Riph, who received him with the greatest kindness, and at once adopted him as son. ^[4. See Sepher Hαkkabbalah of Rabad II. {q.v.}. ] Again, when Riph himself was at the point of death he recommended to the congregation of Lucena for successor, not his own learned and virtuous son Ya'akob, but the yet more learned, though not more virtuous, R. Yoseph Ibn Migash, ^[5. See Hemdah Genuzah (Königsberg, 1856, 8vo), leaf 30a. ] who became the teacher of the teachers of Maimonides (g.u).

Although Riph’s works which are known are only two, the editions of one of these and the commentaries thereon are very numerous; we can only mention a few of them.

I. Hilekhoth Rab Al-phez. (1) With the Novellae of Rabbenu Nissimb. Reuben, the Decisions of R. Mordekhaib. Hillel (see Rosh), the Novellae of one of the disciples of Rabbenu Yonah, the commentaries of R. Yehonathan Hakkohen of Lunel and R. Yoseph Habibo (Constantinople, 1509, fol.). (2) The second edition we have already mentioned. (3) With the Strictures by R. Zerahyah Hallevi (author of the Maor) and Nachmanides’s defence called Milhamoth Adonai (see Ramban), &c. (Venice, 1552, fol.). Each subsequent edition contains additional matter.

II. Respοnsa, originally some, if not all of them, written in Arabic (Leghorn, 1781, and reprint, Vienna 1794, both in 4to).
