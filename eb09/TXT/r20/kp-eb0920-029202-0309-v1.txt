RATNAGIRI or Rtttna.gherry, a British district of India, in the Konkan division of the Bombay presidency, with an area of 3922 square miles. It lies between 15° 40' and 18° 5' N. lat. and 73° 5' and 73° 55' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by the Savitri river, separating it from the Janjira Agency, and by Kolaba district; on the E. by the Western Ghats, dividing it from the districts of Satara and Belgaum and the native state of Kolhapur; on the S., where it is reduced to a strip of sea-coast not more than 4 miles wide, by the Portuguese possessions of Goa; and on the W. by the Arabian Sea. The district forms a belt between the Ghats and the sea, and its general character is rocky and rugged; nearly all the fertile land lies on the banks of the streams which intersect the country. The coast, about 150 miles in length, is almost uniformly rocky and dangerous. At intervals of about 10 miles a river or bay opens, sufficiently large to form a secure harbour for native craft, and the promontories at the river-mouths are almost invariably crowned with the ruins of an old fort. The rivers and creeks are generally navigable for about 20 miles, and afford great facilities for a coasting trade. The denudation of the forests has apparently tended to promote deposits of silt; but active measures have of late been taken to preserve and extend the forest area. Tigers, leopards, bears, bison, wild boar, sambhar deer, and hyaenas are found in the forests on the slopes and near the foot of the Sahyadri Hills. At the beginning of British rule there were no roads, and traffic was confined to places where there was water carriage; but a network of roads has now been made, and the opening of the Ghat roads to cart traffic has revolutionized the trade and concentrated it at Chiplun, Rajapur, and Yengurla, which form the gates of a considerable traffic to and from the Deccan. The exports are salt fish, shell-lime, and cocoa-nuts, and the imports comprise food grains, molasses, tobacco, chillies, ground nuts, turmeric, ghi, blankets, piece goods, and iron. The mean temperature, as registered at Ratnagiri station, is 78°6־, and the average annual rainfall is 10358־ inches.

In 1881 the population of Ratnagiri district was 997,090 (473,053 males and 524,037 females),—Hindus numbering 921,046, Mohammedans 71,051, and Christians 3275. The district contains three towns with a population exceeding 10,000, —Ratnagiri (see below)! Malwan (15,565), and Chiplun (12,065). Since it came under British rule the number of inhabitants has increased threefold; all the land is occupied, and the population is greater than the land can feed. Food has in consequence to he imported, and the condition of the people would be deplorable were it not their custom to move in large numbers to Bombay in search of employment, where they earn good wages and return to spend it in their homes. The chief crops are grain and rice. The extent of arable land is small, but on the whole cultivation is good. Of 1,117,686 acres under actual cultivation in 1883-84, of v׳hich 38,865 v r ere twice cropped, cereals occupied 1,020,583 and pulses 41,733 acres. There are no manufactures of any importance; but the school of industry at Ratnagiri possesses steam saw-mills, and undertakes wood and iron work of all descriptions. The revenue of the district in 1883-84 amounted to £126,596, of which the land-tax contributed £91,429.

Ratnagiri formed part of the dominions of the peshwa, and was annexed by the British Government in 1818 on the overthrow of Baji Rao.
