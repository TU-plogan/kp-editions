RHEA (or Rheea) FIBRE is a textile material yielded by one or more species of B'ohmeria (nat. ord. Urticaceae), plants found over a wide range in India, China, the Malay Peninsula and islands, and Japan. Rhea is also capable of being grown in temperate latitudes, and has been experimentally introduced into the south of France and Algeria. The most important source of rhea fibre, known also very inappropriately as China grass, or by its Malay name Ramie, is B. ηiυea. It is a shrubby plant growing to the height of from 5 to 8 feet with foliage and inflorescence like the common nettle, but destitute of stinging hairs. Some authorities consider the variety cultivated in China to be specifically distinct from the Indian plant. An allied plant called Pooalι or Puya, B. Puya, found growing wild in the north of India, is also a source of rhea fibre. Among the Chinese much care is bestowed on the cultivation of Chu or Tchou Ma, as rhea is called by them, and they prepare the fibre by a tedious and costly process of selection and manual labour. The plant thrives in hot, moist, shaded situations; propagated from slips or root cuttings, it throws up from three to five crops of stems in the course of a season, although not more than three crops are commonly reckoned on. Each such crop may yield about 250 lb of marketable fibre per acre, that total output being exceeded only by the jute crop. The stems when ripe are cut down, stripped of leaves and branchlets, and, either split or whole, are freed from their cortical layers till the bast layer is exposed. In this state they are made up in small bundles and placed where they receive strong sunlight by day and dews by night for several days, after which the fibrous bast layer is peeled with ease off the woody core, and the separated fibres are thereafter treated with boiling water to remove as far as possible adherent gummy and resinous matter in which the fibres are embedded in the stalks. The fibre so obtained is usually bleached by exposure on the grass, and it comes into the market as brilliant white filaments with a fine silky gloss, having a strength, lustre, and smoothness unequalled by any other vegetable fibre.

The fibre first appeared in the European market in 1810, and a cord then spun from it was found to sustain a weight of 252 lb, while a similar cord of Russian hemp was estimated by Admiralty test not to bear more than 87 lb. A fibre possessed of such strength and beauty immediately attracted great attention, and throughout the early half of the century numerous efforts were made by the East India Company to introduce it as a textile staple. But many difli[9:20:507]culties have been encountered in its working, some of which are not yet overcome. The fibre itself is very difficult of extraction owing to the large amount of adhesive matter in which it is embedded, and it is proportionately so expensive that it practically comes into competition only with silk and wool. Further, rhea is hard and inelastic, and on the machinery adapted for spinning other textiles it can only be spun into a rough, harsh, and hairy yarn, while fabrics into which it is woven are rigid, and show permanent creases at every fold. In the form of cordage, moreover, it cuts and gives way at sharp knots and twists. Notwithstanding all disappointments and drawbacks, the Indian Government considered the fibre of such importance that in 1869 two prizes of £5000 and £2000 and again in 1877 prizes of £5000 and £1000 were offered for machinery or processes by which the fibre could be prepared at such a cost per ton as would render its introduction into the market practicable. Competitive trials were made at Saharanpur in 1872 and 1879, but no machine was found to satisfy the conditions of success, although in 1872 a reward of £1500 wasgranted to Mr John Greig, jun., of Edinburgh, and in 1879 £500 and £100 respectively were paid to two of the competitors. The extraction of rhea continues to attract attention, and quite recently (1885) it has been announced that Prof. Frémy of Paris, assisted by M. Urbain, has successfully overcome all difficulties. The raw material used by Prof. Frémy is obtained by a process devised by M. Fevier, which consists in submitting the newly cut stems to low-pressure steam for twenty minutes, after which the whole rind is separated in ribands from its woody core with the utmost ease. These ribands are then dried, and on them Prof. Frémy operates with alkaline solutions which are varied in strength according to the appearance of the material dealt with, and a pure fibre in fine working condition is thus obtained. Rhea has yet to establish its position among European textiles, but in the East its value is well recognized. It is extensively used for cordage, fishing nets, &c.; and it is very little affected by water. The Chinese prepare an exceedingly fine “grass cloth” from single filaments of rhea, knotted or gummed end to end in the way they employ the finest filaments of Manila hemp for making ‘ ‘ Pina” gauze.
