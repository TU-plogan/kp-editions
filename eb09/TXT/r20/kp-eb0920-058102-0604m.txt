RIXDORF a large village to the south-east of Berlin, and practically an outlying suburb of that city, with which it is connected by tramway, is chiefly interesting as a foundation of Moravian Brethren from Bohemia, who settled here in 1737, under the protection of King Frederick William I. German Rixdorf, which is now united with Bohemian Rixdorf, was a much more ancient place, and appears as Richardsdorf in 1630 and as Riegenstorp in 1435. The inhabitants of the united community (who numbered 18,729 in 1880, though only 3421 in 1852) are engaged chiefly in weaving, in the manufacture of india-rubber goods, and in the various industries of the neighbouring capital.
