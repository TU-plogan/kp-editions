RAIMBACHAbraham (1776-1843), line-engraver, a Swiss by descent, was born in London in 1776. Educated at Archbishop Tenison’s Library School, he was an apprentice to J. Hall the engraver from 1789 to 1796. For nine years part of his working-time was devoted to the study of drawing in the Royal Academy and to executing occasional engravings for the booksellers, whilst his leisure hours Were employed in painting portraits in miniature. Having formed an intimacy with Sir David Wilkie, Raim-bach in 1812 began to engrave some of that master’s best pictures. The Village Politicians, the Rent-Day, the Cut Finger, Blind-Man’s Buff, the Errand-Boy, Distraining for Rent, the Parish Beadle, and the Spanish Mother and Child raised him in the estimation of connoisseurs, the French especially holding him in great honour. It is said that he never employed any assistants, but executed the whole of his plates With his own hand. At his death, in 1843, he held a gold medal awarded to him for his Village Poli ticians at the Paris Exhibition of 1814. He was elected corresponding member of the Institute of France in 1835.
