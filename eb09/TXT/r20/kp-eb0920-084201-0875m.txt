RONSDORF a town in north-western Prussia, on the Morsbach, a small affluent of the Rhine, 18 miles west of DÃ¼sseldorf, contains considerable iron and brass works, foundries, and wire-works, besides carrying on extensive manufactures of ribbons, trimmings, and similar goods. The population in 1880 was 10,100.

Founded in 1737 by the followers of Elias Eller, a religious enthusiast, Ronsdorf received town-rights in 1745. The Ronsdorf sect, the members of which called themselves Zionites, is now extinct.
