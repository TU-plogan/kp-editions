RHEYDT a manufacturing town of Rhenish Prussia, is situated on the Niers, 14 miles to the west of DÃ¼sseldorf. The principal products of its numerous factories are silk, cotton, woollen, and mixed fabrics, iron goods, machinery, lamp wicks, and roofing pasteboard. Dyeing and finishing are also carried on. The most prominent buildings are the old parish church and a new one erected in 1866. Rheydt is an ancient place, but its industrial importance is of very recent growth. At the beginning of the present century it did not contain more than 2000 to 3000 inhabitants, whereas in 1880 the population of the municipal commune was 19,087, two-thirds of whom were Protestants.
