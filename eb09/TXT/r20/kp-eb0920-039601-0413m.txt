The railway station is 6 miles west of Glasgow. The industries are connected with two shipbuilding yards, a chemical work, a forge, a dye work, and weaving. Population in 1881, 5115.

The town, which is spoken of as a burgh in 1160, seems to have been in the 16th and early in the 17th century the principal port on the Clyde, one branch of which ran in a channel, now silted up, close behind the houses on the north side of High Street. The original castle of the Stewards seems to have stood on the island called “The King’s Inch,” between the two channels of the river. Renfrew is one of the Kilmarnock group of parliamentary burghs.
