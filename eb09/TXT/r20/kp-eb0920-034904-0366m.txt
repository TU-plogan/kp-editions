REICHENBACHGeorg von (1772-1826), astronomical instrument maker, was born at Durlach in Baden on August 24, 1772. He first served as an officer of artillery, and afterwards held several civil appointments in Bavaria. Already from 1796 he was occupied with the construction of a dividing engine; in 1804 he founded, with Liebherr and Utzschneider, an instrumentmaking business in Munich; and in 1809 he established, with Fraunhofer and Utzschneider, equally important optical works at Benedictbeuern, which were moved to Munich in 1823. He withdrew from both enterprises in 1814, and founded with Ertel a new optical business, from which also he retired in 1820. He died at Munich on May 21, 1826.

Reichenbach’s principal merit is his having introduced into observatories the meridian or transit circle, combining the transit instrument and the mural circle into one instrument. This had already been done by Roemer about 1704, but the idea had not been adopted by any one else, the only exception being the transit circle constructed by Troughton for Groombridge in 1806. The transit circle in the form given it by Reichenbach had one finely-divided circle attached to one end of the horizontal axis and read by four verniers on an “Alhidade Circle,” the unaltered position of which was tested by a spirit level. The instrument came almost at once into universal use on the Continent (the first one was made for Bessel in 1819), but in England the mural circle and transit instrument were not superseded for many years.
