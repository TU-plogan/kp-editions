REGGIO NELL’ EMILIA, a city and episcopal see of Italy, in the province of Reggio nell’ Emilia (up till 1859 part of the duchy of Modena), is situated on the line of the old Via ./Emilia, 17 miles by rail south-east of Parma. It is a large, well-built, and flourishing place with a population in 1881 of 18,634 (commune 56,031) within the circuit of its walls. Among the points of principal interest are the Piazza Maggiore, with the statue of the river Crostolo; the cathedral, which was founded in 857 a.d. but dates mainly from the 15th century; the cocathedral basilica of San Prospero, with its six old Lombard lions in front; the public library, which contains the published and unpublished works of Spallanzani; the museum, in which are preserved the same naturalist’s collections; the large municipal theatre, famous for its operas throughout Italy; and the municipal “palace,” with the statue of Csecilius Metellus. In the neighbourhood of the city there is an extensive model lunatic asylum as well as a large poorhouse. The house in which Ariosto was born in the Corso della Ghiara is now municipal property. Horse-races are held at Reggio every year.

Regium Lepidi or Regiuni Lepidium was probably founded by zEmilius Lepidus at the time of the construction of the zEmilian Way. It was during the Roman period a flourishing municipium, but never became a colony; and, though the name is frequently mentioned in the course of the civil war, it is associated with no event more interesting than the assassination of M. Brutus, the father of Caesar’s friend and foe. The bishopric dates from 450 A.D. Under the Lombards the town was the scat of dukes and counts; in the 12th and 13th centuries it formed a flourishing republic, busied in surrounding itself with walls (1209), controlling the Crostolo and constructing navigable canals to the Po, coining money of its own, and establishing prosperous schools. About 1290 it first passed into the hands of Obizzo d’Este, and the authority of the same family was after many vicissitudes more formally recognized in 1409. In the contest for liberty which began in 1796 and closed with annexation to Piedmont in 1859 Reggio took vigorous part. Besides Ariosto, the city has given birth to Secchi the astronomer and Prospero Clementi the sculptor; and the poet Boiardo was governor of Reggio for many years before his death in 1494.
