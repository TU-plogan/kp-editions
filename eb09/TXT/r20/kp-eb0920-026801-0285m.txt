RAMSGATE a seaport and watering-place of England, in the Isle of Tlianet, Kent, and a “vill ” of the old Cinque Port of Sandwich, is finely situated between chalk cliffs at the northern extremity of Pegwell Bay, on the London, Chatham, and Dover Railway, 79 miles east-south-east of London. It possesses a fine stretch of sand, and is much frequented as a Avatering-place. It first rose into importance in the beginning of the 18th century through its trade with Russia. In 1749 it was selected as a harbour of refuge for the Downs, and the erection of a pier under the direction of Smeaton was begun in 1787. The harbour has been improved at various periods, and now (1885) covers an area of 51 acres, enclosed by two piers, one about 1200 and the other about 1500 feet in length, accommodation being afforded for as many as 400 sail. The limits of the port were extended in 1882. A considerable shipping trade in coal and provisions is carried on, and there is also a fleet of 150 vessels engaged in the North Sea fishery. A fine promenade pier was erected in 1881. The town possesses a town-hall (1839), assembly rooms, and extensive bathing establishments. The church of St George was built in 1826. There is a small Roman Catholic cathedral, built by Welby Pugin. The neighbouring Peg-well Bay, famed for its shrimps, is supposed to have been the scene of the landing of Hengist and Horsa, and at Cliff’s End (Ebbs Fleet) a monolithic cross marks the landing-place of St Augustine in 596. On the summit of Osengal Hill, about a mile to the west of the town, a graveyard of the early Saxon settlers was discovered during the cutting of the railway. Ramsgate was incorporated as a borough in 1884. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 2278 acres) in 1871 was 19,640, and in 1881 22,683, or, including 638 fishermen at sea, 23,321.
