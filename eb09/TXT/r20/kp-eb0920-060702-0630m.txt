ROBINS Benjamin (1707-1751), an English natural philosopher, was born at Bath in 1707. His parents were Quakers in poor circumstances, and gave him very little education. Aided solely by his own talent for exact science, he made considerable progress, and attracted so much notice that he was introduced to Pemberton, who befriended and encouraged him. For a time he maintained himself by teaching mathematics, but soon devoted himself to more congenial work. In particular he carried out an extensive series of experiments in gunnery, the results of which were afterwards embodied in his famous treatise on Hew Principles in Gunnery (8vo, London, 1742). In this treatise is described the ballistic pendulum, an instrument which has become classical in the history of dynamics, and which bears the name of its inventor. Robins also made a number of very important experiments on the resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles, and on the force of gunpowder, with computation of the velocities thereby communicated to military projectiles. He compared the results of his theory with experimental determinations of the ranges of mortars and cannon, and gave practical maxims for the management of artillery. He also made observations on the flight of rockets and wrote on the advantages of rifled barrels. So great was his fame as a scientific artillerist that Euler translated his work on gunnery into German and added to it a critical commentary of his own. Of less interest nowadays are Robins’s more purely mathematical writings, such as his Discourse concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s Methods of Fluxions and of Prime and Ultimate Ratios (8vo, London, 1735), “A Demonstration of the Eleventh Proposition of Sir Isaac Newton’s Treatise of Quadratures” {Phil. Trans., 1727), and similar works. Besides his scientific labours Robins took an active part in politics. He wrote pamphlets in support of the opposition to Sir Robert Walpole, and was secretary of a committee appointed by the House of Commons to inquire into the conduct of that minister. He also wrote a preface to the Report on the Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into the Conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope, in which he gave an apology for the affair at Preston-pans. In 1750 he was appointed engineer-general to the East India Company, and went out to superintend the reconstruction of their forts. The climate, however, disagreed with him, and he died on 29th July 1751. His works were published in two volumes 8vo in 1761.
