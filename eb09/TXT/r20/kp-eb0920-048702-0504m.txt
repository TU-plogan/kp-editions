RESTOUT Jean Bernard, son of the above, was born at Paris, February 22, 1732, and died in the same city on July 18, 1797. In 1758 he won the Great Prize, and on his return from Italy was received into the Academy; but his refusal to comply with rules led to a quarrel with that body which alienated him from his profession. Roland brought him into notice by appointing him keeper of the Garde Meuble, but this piece of favour nearly cost him his life during the Terror: he was cast into prison and was only saved from the guillotine by the reaction of Thermidor. The St Bruno painted by him at Rome is in the Louvre.
