REQUENA a town of Spain, in the province of Valencia, 41 miles to the west of that city on the road to Cuenca, occupies a strong position near the river 01eana in the rocky mountainous district called Las Cabrillas separating Valencia from Castile. It is commanded by a castle, and still has traces of the walls that anciently encircled it. The tower of the church of San Salvador is the only other feature of architectural interest. The principal industries are those connected with the culture of grain, fruit, wine, saffron, and silk. The population of the municipality in 1877 was 13,527.
