ROCKLAND a city and seaport of the United States, county town of Knox county, Maine, is situated 60 miles by rail east-north-east of Portland on Owl’s Head Bay, an inlet of Ponobscot Bay. It was incorporated in 1854, has an area of 7000 acres and a sea frontage of about 4∣ miles, and numbered 7599 inhabitants in 1880 (in 1870 7074). Lime-burning is the staple trade (1,000,000 barrels per annum). The adjacent islands—Dix Island, Hurricane Island, &c.—are known by their granite quarries. Water for the city is obtained from Lake Chickawaukie.
