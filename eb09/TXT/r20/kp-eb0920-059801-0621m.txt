ROBERTSON Thomas William (1829-1871), English dramatist, was born on 9th January 1829. As a dramatist he had a brief but very brilliant career. It is not too much to say that he was the most successful and distinguished writer of plays in his generation. The son of a provincial actor and manager, chief of a “circuit” that ranged from Bristol to Cambridge, Robertson was familiar with the stage from his childhood; but it was not till the last seven years of his life that he made his mark. He was never, as he admitted himself, very successful as an actor. He tried his hand also at writing plays, and a farcical comedy by him, A Night's Adventure, was produced at the Olympic under Farren’s management as early as 1851. But this did not make good his footing, and he remained for some years longer in the provinces, varying, his work as an actor with miscellaneous contributions to newspapers. In 1860 he went to London with the intention, it is said, of making his living by journalism and light literature. He edited a mining journal and contributed to it a novel afterwards dramatized with the title Shadow Tree Shaft. He wrote a farce entitled A Cantab, which was played at the Strand in 1861. Then, in 1864, came his first marked success, David Garrick, produced at the Haymarket with Sothern in the principal character.. It was not, however, till the production of Society at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1865, under the management of Miss Marie Wilton, afterwards Mrs Bancroft, that the originality and cleverness of the dramatist were fully recognized. Play-writer and company were exactly suited one to another; the plays and the acting together—the small size of the playhouse being also in their favour—were at once recognized as a new thing, and, while some critics sneered at the “cup-and-saucer comedy,” voted it absurdly realistic, said there was nothing in it but commonplace life represented without a trace of Sheridanian wit and sparkle, all London flocked to the little house in Tottenham Street, and the stage was at once inundated with imitations of the new style of acting and the new kind of play.

Robertson, although his health was already undermined, followed up Society in quick succession with the series of characteristic plays which made the reputation of himself, the company, and the theatre. Ours was produced in 1866, Caste in 1867, Play in 1868, School in 1869, M.P. in 1870. For twenty years there probably has not been a week, hardly a night, in which some one of Robertson’s plays has not been produced somewhere in Great Britain,.

and still they show no sign of abating popularity. The masterly stage-craft is undoubtedly one of the elements in this remarkable conquest of the play-going public; the purity and generous morality of the plays another; the dialogue—which is always bright and clever, without any straining after or indeed much attaining to wit—a third; the humour, distinctness, and typical representativeness of the characters a fourth. That there is more art and individuality in the plays than critics at first were willing to admit is clear from the fact that none of Robertson’s numerous imitators have succeeded in catching his happy knack. Another proof of something like genius—dramatic genius if not literary genius—is the skill with which he repeats the same idea with such variations that each time it is as fresh as if it were new. Again and again his situations owe their point to the contrast between generous kindness of heart and sordid worldliness, or between the ardent trustful affections of youth and the cynicism of disenchanted middle age. Pleasant sunny brightness and ingenuity within a narrow range constitute Robertson’s distinction rather than breadth or fertility or striking brilliancy of wit. He knew his powers and worked steadily within them, not striving to go beyond. With the exception of David Garrick and Home, written for the Haymarket, and Dreams for the Gaiety, all his well-known plays were written for the Prince of Wales Theatre, with which his distinctive style of comedy is identified. Unhappily he did not live long to enjoy his success, but died in London in February 1871.
