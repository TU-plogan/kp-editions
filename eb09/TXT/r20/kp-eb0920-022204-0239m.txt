RAI BARELI or Roy Bareilly, town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated on the banks of the Sai in 26° 14' N. lat. and 81° 17' E. long. It was founded by the Bhars, who called it Bharauli, but it was subsequently corrupted into Bareli. The prefix “Rai” is either derived from Rahi, a village near the town, or from the fact of its having been long in the possession of a Kayasth family bearing the name of Rai. The population of the town (1881) is 11,781 (males 5970, females 5811). It possesses many architectural features, chief of which is a spacious and strong fort erected in 1403, and constructed of bricks 2 feet long by 1 foot thick and 1| wide. Among its ancient buildings are the magnificent palace and tomb of Nawab Jahan Khan, the governor in the time of Aurangzeb, and four fine mosques.
