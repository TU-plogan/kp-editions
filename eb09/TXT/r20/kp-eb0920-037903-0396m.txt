REMSCHEID a manufacturing town of Rhenish Prussia, in the district of Düsseldorf, sometimes dignified with the title of the “Rhenish Sheffield,” is situated about 20 miles to the north-east of Cologne, at a height of 1120 feet above the sea. It is the centre of the German hardware industry, and large quantities of tools, scythes, skates, and other small articles in iron, steel, and brass are annually made here for exportation to all parts of Europe, the East, and North and South America. In 1880 the commune contained 30,029 inhabitants (26,844 Protestants), of whom 11,000 belonged to Remscheid proper and the rest to the manufacturing villages with which it is grouped. The name of Remscheid occurs in a document of 1132, and the town received the first impulse to its! industrial importance through the immigration of Protestant refugees from France and Holland.
