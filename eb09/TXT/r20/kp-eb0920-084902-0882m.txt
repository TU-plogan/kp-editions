ROSCOMMON ", an inland county of Ireland, in the province of Connaught, is bounded N.E. by Leitrim, N.W. by Sligo, W. by Mayo, W. and S. by Galway, E. by Longford, and E. and S. by Westmeath and King’s County. The total area is 607,691 acres or nearly 950 square miles. The greater part of the county belongs to the great limestone plain, and is either flat or very slightly undulating. In the north-east, on the Leitrim border, the Braulieve Mountains, consisting of rugged and precipitous ridges of limestone gravel with flattened summits, attain an elevation at their highest point of 1377 feet; and in the north[9:20:850]west the Curlew Mountains, of similar formation, between Roscommon and Sligo rise abruptly to a height of over SOO feet. In the east the Slievebawn range, formed of sandstone, have a somewhat similar elevation. The Connaught coal field, which embraces the mountainous district round Lough Allen, touches on Roscommon, but the mineral is not much wrought within the limits of the county. Ironstone is also found in the same district, but mining is no longer prosecuted. The Shannon with its expansions forms nearly the whole eastern boundary of the county, and on the west the Suck from Mayo forms for over 50 miles the boundary with Galway till it unites with the Shannon at Shannon Bridge. The other tributaries of the Shannon within the county are the Arigna, the Feorish, and the Boyle. The lakes formed by expansions of the Shannon on the borders of Roscommon are Loughs Allen, Boderg, Boffin, Forbes, and Ree. Of the numerous other lakes within the county the most important are Lough Key in the north, very picturesquely situated with finely wooded banks, and Lough Gara in the west.

Agriculture.— The subsoil is principally limestone, but there is some light sandy soil in the south. In the level parts the land when drained and properly cultivated is very fertile, especially in the district known as the plains of Boyle, which includes some of the richest grazing land in Ireland. Along the banks of the Suck and Shannon there is, however, a large extent of bog and marsh. Of the 130,426 acres in crop in 1884 only 61,0δ5 acres were under tillage, while 69,371 acres were under meadow and clover. Corn crops occupied 26,931 acres, of which 26,246 were under oats; and green crops occupied 33,443 acres, of which 26,178 were under potatoes and 5236 under turnips. Horses and mules in 1884 numbered 11,134, cattle 106,546 (of which 27,084 were milch cows), asses 8801, sheep 147,077, pigs 35,493, and goats 10,822. According to the latest return the county was divided among 707 proprietors possessing 577,999 acres at an annual valuation of £294,698. The following possessed upwards of 20,000 acres:— ColonelKing-Harman, 29,242acres; H. S. P. Mahon, 26,980; Lord De Freyne, 25,437; and Thos. Wills-Sandford, 24,411.

Railways.— A branch of the Midland Great AVestern Railway traverses the north-eastern boundary of the county to Sligo, and another the south-western boundary to AVestport, whilst a third crosses the southern corner to Galway.

Administration and Population.— The county is divided into 10 baronies, and contains 53 parishes, 7 parts of parishes, and 1995 townlands. The population in 1881 was 132,490—a decrease of nearly one-half since 1841, when it was 253,591. The number of persons who could read and write in 1881 was 66,858, the number who could read only was 18,373, while 47,259 were unable to read or write. The number who spoke Irish and English was 21,494, and 95 were able to speak Irish only. The towns containing over 1000 inhabitants are Roscommon, the county town (2117), Boyle (2994), and Castlerea (1229). AVithin the county are also included a part (3683) of Athlone, the remainder being in Westmeath, a part (947) of Ballinasloe, the larger part being in Galway, and a very small portion (100) of Carrick-on-Shannon, which is situated chiefly in Leitrim. Ecclesiastically the county belongs to the Elphin diocese, with small portions in those of Tuam, Clonfert, and Ardagh. It is in the Connaught circuit. Assizes are held at Roscommon and quarter sessions at Athlone, Boyle, Castlerea, and Roscommon. There are nine petty sessions districts within the county and parts of four others. It is in the Dublin military district, and there are barrack stations at Athlone, Boyle, Castlerea, and Roscommon.

History.— The district was granted by Henry III. to Richard de Burgo, but remained almost wholly in the possession of the native septs. Until the time of Elizabeth Connaught was included in the two districts of Roscommon and Clare, and when these were subdivided Roscommon was assigned its present limits. It takes its name (Irish Ros-Comain, Comains wood) from the county town, at which a monastery was founded by St Coman in the 6th century. All the old proprietors were dispossessed at the Cromwellian settlement, except the O’Conor family, now headed by the O’Conor Don. The most interesting antiquarian remains within the county are the ruins of Crogan, the ancient palace of the kings of Connaught. The principal ancient castles are the old stronghold of the M‘Der-motfs on Castle Island, Lough Key, the dismantled castle of the M i Donoughs at Ballinafad, the extensive fortress at Roscommon rebuilt by John D’Uflord, justiciary of Ireland in 1268, and the keep of Athlone, now used as barracks. The abbey of Boyle is in remarkably good preservation, and exhibits good specimens of the Norman arch. The other monastic remains within the county are of comparatively small importance.
