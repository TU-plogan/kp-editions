ROMANS a town of France, in the department of Drôme, 12 miles north-east of Valence by the railway connecting this town with Grenoble, stands at the foot of an eminence on the right bank of the Isère, 530 feet above the sea. A fine stone bridge unites it with Bourg du Péage on the other side of the river. Both towns owe their prosperity to their situation in the most fertile part of the valley of the Isère, where land is sometimes sold at ¿£200 per acre. The population of Romans was 11,916 (13,806 in the commune) in 1881. The present parish church belonged to an abbey founded in 837 by St Bernard, forty-ninth bishop of Vienne. The north portal, now condemned, dates from the lltli century; the principal portal is one of the finest specimens of 12th-century Romanesque; and the choir and the transept are striking examples of the style of the 13th. Romans has also a wealthy hospital and a large seminary. Besides the silk-trade the local industries comprise shoemaking, tanning, liat-making, oil-refining, &c.
