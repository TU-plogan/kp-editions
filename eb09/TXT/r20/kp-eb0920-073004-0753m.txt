ROMANUS IV. (Diogenes), emperor of the East from 1068 to 1071, was a member of a distinguished Cappadocian family and had risen to distinction in the army when he was convicted of treason against the sons of Constantine X. While waiting execution he was summoned into the presence of their mother, Eudocia Macrembolitissa, the empress regent, whom lie so fascinated that she granted him a free pardon and shortly afterwards married him. Taking the field soon after his coronation, he carried on three campaigns against the Saracens and Seljuk Turks without achieving any decisive success, and in a fourth he was disastrously defeated by Alp Arslan on the banks of the Araxes and taken prisoner. Released from captivity after promising to pay a large ransom and concluding a treaty of peace, he returned homewards only to find revolution in full flood, and after a second defeat of his arms by the troops of Michael VII. he was compelled to resign the empire and retire to the island of Prote, where he soon died in great misery. It was during this reign that by the surrender of Bari (15th April 1071) the Byzantine empire lost its last hold upon Italy.
