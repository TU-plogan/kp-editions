REPSOLD, a family of German instrument makers. Johann Georg Repsold (1771-1830), was born at Wremen in Hanover on September 23, 1771, became an engineer and afterwards chief of the fire brigade in Hamburg, where he started business as an instrument maker early in the present century. He was killed by the fall of a wall during afire on January 14, 1830. The business has been continued by his sons Georg and Adolf and his grandsons Johannes and Oscar.

J. G. Repsold introduced essential improvements in the meridian circles by substituting microscopes (on Ramsden’s plan) for the verniers to read the circles, and by making the various parts perfectly symmetrical. For a number of years the tirm was foremost in this special branch and furnished meridian circles to the observatories at Hamburg, Königsberg, Pulkova, &c.; later on the activity in this direction declined, while Pistor and Martins of Berlin rose to eminence in the manufacturing of transit circles. But after the discon- ! tinuance of this firm that of Repsold has again come to the front, not only in the construction of transit circles, but also of equatorial I mountings and more especially of heliometers (see Micrometer).
