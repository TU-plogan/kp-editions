ROLLOCK Robert (1555-1599), the first principal of the university of Edinburgh, was the son of David Rollock of Powis near Stirling, and was born in 1555. He received his early education at the school of Stirling from Thomas Buchanan, a nephew of George Buchanan, and after graduating at St Andrews became regent of philosophy there in 1580. In 1583 he was appointed by the Edinburgh town council sole “regent” of the “town’s college” (“Academia Jacobi Sexti”), and three years later he received from the same source the title of “principal or first master,” and also, with consent of the presbytery, professor of theology. From 1587 he also preached regularly to large audiences every Sunday morning at 7 A.M., and ultimately, yielding to urgent entreaties, he accepted “the full burden of one of the eight ministers of the city.” He took a prominent part in the somewhat troubled church politics of the day, and distinguished himself among his compeers by gentleness and tact, as well as ability. In 1593 he was appointed, along with some others, by parliament to confer with the popish lords, and in 1597 it was through his mediation with the king that the ministers of Edinburgh, banished in consequence of a “tumult” in December 1596, were permitted to return. For his eminent services he was chosen moderator of the General Assembly held at Dundee in May 1597. His death took place at Edinburgh on 8th February 1599.

Rollock published in Latin a commentary On the Epistle to the Ephesians (1590), a similar work On Daniel (1591), a Logical Analysis of the Epistle to the Romans (1594), Questions and Answers on the Covenant of God (1596), a treatise On Effectual Calling (1597), and commentaries on Thessalonians (1598), fifteen selected Psalms (1599), and the Gospel of St John (1599). Soon after his death eleven Sermons were published from notes taken by his students, and his Select Works by the Wodrow Society in 1849.
