RIDLEY Nicholas (c. 1500-1555), bishop of London, and a martyr to the Reformation, was descended from a family long seated in Northumberland. The second son of Nicholas Ridley of Unthank near Willimoteswick in that county, he was born in the beginning of the 16th century. From the grammar school of Newcastle-upon-Tyne he was sent to Pembroke College, Cambridge, about 1518, being supported there by his uncle, Dr Robert Ridley, fellow of Queen’s College. At the university he specially distinguished himself in Greek. He proceeded B.A. 1522-23, became a fellow of his college, and, having taken orders, was sent about 1527 at the expense of his uncle to study on the Continent, first at the Sorbonne, Paris, and afterwards at Louvain. On his return to Cambridge he was in 1530 chosen under-treasurer of the university; and in 1534 he was senior proctor, when along with the vice-chancellor and the other proctor Richard Wilkes he signed the decree of the university against the jurisdiction of the pope in England. About this time he began to distinguish himself as an orator and disputant, and was chosen chaplain of the university, and “Magister Glo-meriae,”—an office in which most probably (for its duties have been much disputed) he had to instruct the university entrants in Latin. Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, after Ridley had proceeded B.D. in 1537, appointed him one of his chaplains, and in April 1538 collated him to the vicarage of Herne, Kent, where he began to preach the doctrines of the Reformation. In 1540, having commenced doctor of divinity, he was made king’s chaplain; and in the same year he was elected master of his college in Cambridge. Soon after he was appointed a canon of Canterbury. At the instigation of Bishop Gardiner he was accused in the bishop’s court of preaching against the doctrine of the Six Articles, but after the matter had been referred to commissioners specially appointed by the king he was acquitted. In 1545 he renounced the doctrine of tran-substantiation, and was made, a canon of Westminster. In 1547 he was presented by the fellows of Pembroke Hall to the living of Soham, Cambridgeshire, and the same year was consecrated bishop of Rochester. In 1550 he was one of the commissioners for examining Bishops Gardiner and Bonner. He concurred in their deprivation, and succeeded the latter in the see of London. In 1552, returning from Cambridge, he paid a visit to the princess, afterwards Queen Mary, at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire. On account of her unqualified condemnation of the Reformed doctrines, he from this time concurred in the proposals to exclude her from the throne, and he signed the will of Edward VI. settling the crown on Lady Jane Grey. On the death of the king, he, in a sermon at St Paul’s Cross, 16th July [9:20:550]1553, affirmed that Mary was illegitimate, and predicted that her accession would be disastrous to the religious interests of England. After the proclamation of Mary he set out for Framlingham to confess his offences against her, but was met with a warrant for his arrest and was committed to the Tower. In March 1554 he was sent down, along with Cranmer and Latimer, to Oxford to be tried before a committee of convocation. He was convicted of heresy, and after refusing to recant was sentenced to death. The trial having been declared irregular, he was, in September 1555, along with Cranmer and Latimer, tried by special commissioners, and on the 16th October lie, in company with Latimer, was burnt at the stake at Oxford.
