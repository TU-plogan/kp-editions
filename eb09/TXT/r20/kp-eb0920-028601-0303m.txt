RASKRasmus Christian (1787-1832), an eminent scholar and philologist, was born at Brändekilde in the Island of Fünen or Fyen in Denmark in 1787. He studied at the university of Copenhagen, and early distinguished himself by singular talent for the acquisition of languages. In the year 1808 he was appointed assistant keeper of the university library, and some years after wards made professor of literary history. In 1811 he published, in Danish, his Introduction to the Grammar of the Icelandic and other Ancient Northern Languages, from printed and MS. materials which had been accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research. The reputation which Rask thus acquired recommended him to the Arna-Magnaean Institution, by which he was employed as editor of the Icelandic Lexicon (1814) of Björn Haldor-son, which had long remained in manuscript. About the same time Rask paid a visit to Iceland, where he remained from 1813 to 18Î5, and made himself completely master of the language and familiarized himself with the literature, manners, and customs of the natives. To the interest with which they inspired him may probably be attributed the establishment at Copenhagen, early in 1816, of the Icelandic Literary Society, which was mainly instituted by his exertions, and of which he was the first president.

In October 1816 Rask left Denmark on a literary expedition, at the cost of the king, to prosecute inquiries into the languages of the East, and collect manuscripts for the university library at Copenhagen. He proceeded first to Sweden, where he remained two years, in the course of which he made an excursion into Finland, for the purpose of studying the language of that country. Here he published, in Swedish, his Anglo-Saxon Grammar in 1817. In 1818 there appeared at Copenhagen, in Danish, an Essay on the Origin of the Ancient Scandinavian or Icelandic Tongue, in which he traced the affinity of that idiom to the other European languages, particularly to the Latin and the Greek. In the same year he brought out the first complete editions of Snorro’s Edda and Saemund’s Edda, in the original text, along with Swedish translations of both Eddas, the originals and the versions occupying each two volumes. From Stockholm he went in 1819 to St Petersburg, where he wrote, in German, a paper on “The Languages and Literature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and Finland,” which was published in the sixth number of the Vienna Jahrbücher. From Russia he proceeded through Tartary into Persia, and resided for some time at Tabriz, Teheran, Persepolis, and Shiraz. In about six weeks he made himself sufficiently master of the Persian to be able to converse freely in that language with the natives. In 1820 he embarked at Bushire for Bombay; and during his residence in the latter city he wrote, in English, “A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language” (Trans. Lit. Soc. of Bombay, vol. iii., reprinted with corrections and additions in Trans. R. As . Soc. ) From Bombay he proceeded through India to Ceylon, where he arrived in 1822, and soon afterwards wrote, in English, “A Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters,” which was printed in the Transactions of the Literary and Agricultural Society of Colombo. Rask returned to Copenhagen in May 1823, bringing with him a considerable number of Oriental manuscripts, Persian, Zend, Pali, Singalese, and others, which now enrich the collections of the Danish capital. He died at Copenhagen on 14th November 1832.

During the period between his return from the East and his death Rask published in his native language a Spanish Grammar (1824), a Frisic Grammar (1825), an Essay on Danish Orthography (1826), a Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology and an Italian Grammar (1827), and the Ancient Jewish Chronology previous to Moses (1828). He likewise edited an edition of Schneider’s Danish Grammar for the use of Englishmen (1830), and superintended the English translation of his valuable Anglo-Saxon Grammar by Thorpe (1830). Rask’s services to comparative philology were very great. He was the first to point out the connexion between the ancient Northern and Gothic on the one hand, and of the Lithuanian, Sclavonic, Greek, and Latin on the other, and he also has the credit of being the real discoverer of the so-called “Grimm’s Law” for the transmutation of consonants in the transition from the old Indo-European languages to Teutonic, although he only compared Teutonic and Greek, Sanskrit being at the time unknown to him. Rask’s facility in the acquisition of languages was extraordinary; in 1822 he was master of no less than twenty-five languages and dialects, and is stated to have studied twice as many. His numerous philological manuscripts were transferred to the king’s library at Copenhagen. Rask’s Anglo-Saxon, Danish, and Icelandic Grammars have been given to the English public by Thorpe, Repp, and Dasent respectively.
