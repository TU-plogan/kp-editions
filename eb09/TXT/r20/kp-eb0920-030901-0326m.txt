RÉCAMIERMadame (whose maiden name was Jeanne Françoise Julie Adelaide Bernard), was born on 4th December 1777 at Lyons, and died at Paris on 11th May 1849. She was married at fifteen to the banker Récamier, who was more than old enough to be her father. Beautiful, accomplished, with a real love for literature, she possessed at the same time a temperament which protected her from scandal, and from the early days of the consulate to almost the end of the July monarchy her salon was one of the chief resorts of literary and political society that pretended to fashion. For some time she was much under the influence of Madame de Staël, and it was partly through her that Madame Récamier became acquainted with Benjamin Constant, whose singular political tergiversations during the last days of the empire and the first of the restoration have been attributed to Madame Récamier. There is no doubt that she succeeded in inspiring a real and almost desperate passion in the heart of Constant, whose letters to her have had a singular fate, having been twice published in part, and twice interfered with by judicial proceedings on the part of the representatives of the parties concerned. In Madame Récamier’s later days she lost most of the fortune which, when she was the wife of a rich banker, had given her part of her consequence; but she continued to receive visitors at the Abbaye-aux-Bois. Here Chateaubriand was a constant visitor, and in a manner master of the house; but Madame Récamier never even in old age, ill-health, and reduced circumstances lost her attraction. After her death Souvenirs et Correspondances tirés des Papiers de Madame Récamier were published. To compile, however, a real account of her would necessitate the ransack of all the memoirs, correspondence, and anecdotage concerning French political and literary life for the first half of this century.
