REMIREMONT the chief town of an arrondisseinent of the department of the Vosges, France, 17 miles south-south-east of Epinal by rail, on the banks of the Moselle where it is joined by the Moselotte. It is a pretty and well-built town picturesquely surrounded by forest-clad mountains, and commanded by Fort Parmont, one of the line of defensive works along the Moselle. Besides a great cotton spinning-mill (30,000 spindles) brought from Miilhausen after the war of 1870, it possesses tanneries, weaving-factories, and saw-mills; and it trades in timber, cattle, cheese, coopers’ wares, <fec. The more interesting buildings belong to the ancient abbey, to which the town owes most of its fame. The abbey church was consecrated to Pope Leo IX. in person in 1051. The abbatial residence (which now contains the mairie, the court-house, and the public library) has been twice rebuilt in modern times (in 1750, and again after the fire of 1871), but the original plan and style have been preserved in the imposing front, the vestibule, and the grand staircase. The population of the town was 6212 in 1871, and 7857 in 1881; that of the commune 6510 and 8126.

Remiremont has its name from St Romaric, one of the companions of St Columban of Luxeuil, who founded a monastery and j a convent on the hills above the site where the town now stands, j On the destruction of these establishments by the Hungarians in 910 a.d. the nuns took refuge at Remiremont, and their new convent became famous under an abbess who “carried not a crosier but a sceptre.” Enriched by dukes of Lorraine, kings of France, and emperors of Germany, the ladies of Remiremont ultimately \ attained to great power. The abbess was a princess of the empire, j and received consecration at the hands of the pope at Rome. The; canonesses (fifty in number) were selected only from those who i could give proof of noble descent. Their property comprised fifty-j two signiories and twenty-two petty lordships. On Whitsun Monday the neighbouring parishes paid homage to the chapter in a ceremony called the “Kyrioles”; and on their accession dukes of Lorraine had to come to Remiremont with great pomp to swear to j continue their protection. The “War of the Scutcheons” (Panon-i ceaux) in 1566 between the duke and the abbess ended in favour of the duke; and the abbess never recovered her former position. The townsfolk took advantage of this and similar contests to extend their municipal privileges. In the 17th century the ladies of Remiremont fell away so much from the original monastic rule as to take the title of countesses, renounce their vows, and marry. The town was attacked by the French in 1638, and ruined by the earthquake of 1682. With the rest of Lorraine it was joined to France in 1766. The monastery on the hill (Mont de Romeric or Saint Mont) and the nunnery in the town were both suppressed in the Revolution.
