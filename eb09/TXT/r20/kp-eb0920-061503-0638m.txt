ROCKFORD a city of the United States, the county seat of Winnebago county, Illinois, on both banks of the Rock river, which, rising in Wisconsin, falls into the Mississippi after a course of 350 miles. By rail it lies 92 miles north-west of Chicago and is a junction of the Chicago and North-Western, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St Paul, and the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroads. Abundant water-power was secured by a dam 800 feet long constructed across the river in 1844. The chief objects of industry of Rockford, one of the largest manufacturing centres in the Mississippi valley, are agricultural implements, furniture, watches, silver-plated ware, cutlery, tacks and nails, bolts, wire-cloth, netting, woollen and cotton goods, paper, flour, oatmeal, glucose. Waterworks on the Holly system (1874) are capable of pumping 5,500,000 gallons through the mains in twenty-four hours. The city stands in a fine agricultural district, is handsomely built and well shaded, and has a public library, a public high school, and ten other public school buildings, a seminary for girls (1849), five banks, and twenty-one churches. The population was 6976 in 1860, 11,049 in 1870, and 13,129 in 1880 (township, 14,525). Rockford was settled about 1836; in 1852 it received incorporation as a city.
