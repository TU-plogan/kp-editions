RAUCHChristian Daniel (1777-1857), one of the most celebrated sculptors of modern times, was born at Arolsen in the principality* of Waldeck on the 2d of January 1777. The opening career of the young artist was attended with considerable difficulty, his parents being poor and unable to place him under efficient masters. His first instructor taught him little else than the art of sculpturing grave-stones, and Professor Ruhl of Cassel could not give him much more. A wider field of improvement opened up before him when he removed to Berlin in 1797; but poverty still hampered all his efforts. He was obliged to earn a livelihood by becoming a royal lackey, and to reserve the prosecution of his favourite art for his spare hours. The genius of Rauch, however, soon forced itself into notice and recommended him to several persons of influence who were able to give him assistance. Queen Louisa, surprising him one day in the act of modelling her features in wax, sent him to study at the Academy of Art. Not long afterwards, in 1804, Count Sandrecky gave him the means to complete his education at Rome, where William von Humboldt, Canova, and Thorwaldsen befriended him. Under such patronage the young sculptor made rapid progress. Among other works, he executed bas-reliefs of Hippolytus and Phaedra, Mars and Venus wounded by Diomede, and a Child praying. In 1811 Rauch entered upon the eminent part of his career, when he Avas commissioned to execute a monument for Queen Louisa of Prussia. The statue, representing the queen in a sleeping posture, was placed in a mausoleum in the grounds of Charlottenburg, and procured great fame for the artist. Commissions for portraits came pouring in upon him. The consummate tact with which he seized individual characteristics and the artistic manner in which he treated them at once established his reputation. The erection of nearly all public statues came to be entrusted to him. He began to execute that long series of representations of great Germans in which his genius is exhibited to full advantage. In course of time almost every important town throughout the country possessed a bust of some eminent statesman, patriot, or man of genius from his chisel. There were, among others, Blücher at Breslau, Maximilian at Munich, Francke at Halle, Dürer at Nuremberg, Luther at Wittenberg, and the grand-duke Paul Frederick at Sch Averin. At length, in 1830, he commenced, along Avith Schinkel the architect, the models for a colossal monument at Berlin to Frederick the Great. This Avork was inaugurated with great pomp in May 1851, and has ever since been regarded as one of the masterpieces of modern sculpture. On a granite pedestal 25 feet in height stands the colossal equestrian statue of the king. His plain pinched features and his grotesque costume are given Avith historical exactness Avithout impairing the artistic effect. An air of resistless majesty ennobles the mean countenance, and a bold and skilful treatment hides the absurdity of the garb. The excellence of his masterpiece was recognized throughout the Avorld. Princes decorated him with honours. The academies of Europe enrolled him among their members. Especially did his OAvn sovereign and countrymen regard him with proud affection and respect. A statue of Kant for Königsberg and a statue of Thaer for Berlin occupied his attention during some of his last years; and he had just finished a model of Moses praying betAveen Aaron and Hur Avlien he was attacked by his last illness. He died on 3d December 1857.
