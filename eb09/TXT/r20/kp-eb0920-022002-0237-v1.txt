RAGATZ or Ragaz, a watering-place in Switzerland, in the canton of St Gall, with a station on the railway to Coire, 64 miles south-east of Zurich, stands 1700 feet above the sea at the mouth of the magnificent gorge through which the impetuous Tamina forces its way to the Rhine; its baths are supplied with mineral water from the hot springs of Pfäffers, which issue from the right side of the ravine 2| miles higher up. As the tourist centre for one of the most picturesque districts of Switzerland, Ragatz has greatly increased since the middle of the century. It had then only 650 inhabitants; in 1870 there were 1825, and in 1880 1996, while the annual number of visitors is about 50,000. In the churchyard is the grave of Schelling, who died at Ragatz in 1854. Ragatz originally belonged to the abbots of the Benedictine monastery of Pfäffers (713-1838); their residence became in 1840 the “Hof Ragatz” hotel, and in 1868 the whole property, which had been seized by the state in 1838, passed into private hands. The Swiss defeated the Austrians at Ragatz in 1446.
