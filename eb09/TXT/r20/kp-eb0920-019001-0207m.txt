R was written in Greek originally as P, following the Phoenician form; sometimes, however, a triangle takes the place of the semicircle; not unfrequently also a short stroke appears where we have the lower limb on the right hand; the reason of this addition is not plain: it can hardly have been a diacritical mark to distinguish R from P (as G from C at Rome) because the latter symbol in Greece always kept its two vertical lines (Γ), the curved line (P) appearing first in the Roman alphabet.

The sounds denoted by the same symbol r differ considerably. First, there is the true consonantal r— our English r in reed, &c.—produced by raising the tip only of the tongue towards the front palate; the voice escapes by this aperture, the side passages between the tongue and the palate being closed; the mechanism, therefore, is just the opposite to that which produces l (see letter L). Secondly, there is the vowel r ; this is due to the space between the tip of the tongue and the palate being sufficiently great to allow the voice to escape without any friction; the difference betλveen this and consonantal r is parallel to that between u and w, or between i and y. This vowel-sound, though not heard regularly in any modern language, is not unfrequent in several in certain combinations; for example, it is quite possible to articulate “father” as “fath-r,” where the r alone forms a syllable and is therefore vocalic. This vowel-sound was a regular sound in Sanskrit, and was probably also heard in the parent language; but in the derived languages (except Sanskrit) it became consonantal r with an independent vowel preceding or following; thus a presumed original “krd” ( = heart), where r denotes the vocalic r, gave in Sanskrit “hrd,” in Greek κpaδdη, in Latin “cor(d).” Thirdly, r may denote a trill,—that is to say, a sound produced by the vibration of the tongue when laid loosely against the palate and set in motion by a strong current of breath or voice. When the point of the tongue is laid loosely in this way against the palate just behind the gums and made to trill as voice passes over it, we hear the Scotch and the French r, each of which is a trill, not a consonantal r. The same sound, but unvoiced, is heard in the French “théâtre,” &c., and is also the Welsh rA. A similar trill at the back part of the palate gives the Northumbrian “burr.”
