RAOUL ROCHETTEDésiré (1783-1854), French archaeologist, was born in 1783 at St Amand in the department of Cher, and received his education at Bourges. In 1813 he was called to the chair of history in the Collège de Louis-le-Grand at Paris. About four years afterwards he was translated to the similar chair in the Sorbonne. The first result of his labours, published in 1815 under the title of Histoire Critique de VÉtablissement des Colonies Grecques , in 4 vols. 8vo, was favourably received by the public. In 1819 he was appointed superintendent of antiquities in the Bibliothèque at. Paris, an office which he held till 1848. To this was added in 1826 the professorship of archaeology at the Bibliothèque, a result of which may be seen in his excellent Cours d'Archéologie (1828). In the following year (1829) appeared his Monuments Inédits , and if this great work is now less frequently referred to than in former years it is because the path which it indicated has been steadily followed out by others, and with more complete results than was possible in his day. A still valuable and interesting work is his Peintures Inédites (1836). So also his Peintures de Pompéi (1844) remains a splendid monument of the enterprise with which he sought to render attractive the study of archaeology. He was a frequent contributor to the Annali of the Roman Institute, the Journal des Savants , and the Académie des Inscriptions, and often engaged in disputes with his contemporaries in matters on which time has for the most part proved him to have been right. At his death in 1854 Raoul Rochette was perpetual secretary of the Academy of Fine Arts and a corresponding member of most of the learned societies in Europe.
