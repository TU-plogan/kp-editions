RÉ Isle of, a long, low island 3 miles off the coast of the French department of Charente Inférieure, runs south-east and north-west with a breadth of about 3 miles and a length of 18£ miles. The north-west point (Pointe des Baleines) has a lighthouse of the first class. The Pertuis Breton separates the island from the coast of La Vendée to the north, and the Pertuis d’Antioche from the Isle of Oléron to the south. With a surface of 18,259 acres, the Isle of Ré has 15,370 inhabitants, whose chief source of income is the salt marshes, producing annually 31,500 tons of salt. The island has also a vineyard and corn lands, and boasts of the excellence of its figs, pears, and cream. Apart from the orchards it is now woodless, though once covered with forests. Oysters are successfully cultivated, the annual supply of these molluscs being 35,000,000. The coast facing the Atlantic is rocky and inhospitable, but there are numerous harbours on the landward side. The island seems once to have been united to the continent, with which it is still connected by a line of sunken rocks; its existence is not mentioned before the 8th century. Tradition says that the city of Antioche on the west coast was destroyed by the Atlantic storms, which still constantly threaten to cut the island in two at the isthmus (only 230 feet wide) formed by the gulf called Fier d’Ars. There are two cantons—St Martin and Ars-en-Ré—in the arrondissement of La Rochelle. St Martin, with a secure harbour, was fortified by Vauban, and is the depot for convicts on their way to New Caledonia.
