RONDA a town of Spain, in the province of Malaga, and about 43 miles to the west of that city. It occupies a site of singular picturesqueness on a high rock nearly surrounded by the Guadalvin (afterwards the Guadiaro), which flows through a deep and abrupt chasm (or “Tajo ”) by which the old town is separated from the new. Of the two bridges the more modern (1761) spans the stream in a single arch at a height of about 255 feet. On the edge of the Tajo is the alameda or public promenade, commanding a wide and beautiful prospect of the fertile valley or vega and the sierra beyond. The old part of the town has a Moorish aspect, with narrow, steep, and crooked lanes, and still retains some Moorish towers and other buildings. The Ronda bull-ring is one of the finest in Spain, and can accommodate 10,000 spectators. Ronda is the seat of a considerable trade in leather, saddlery, and horses, and has an important fair (May 20). The population within the limits of the municipality was 19,181 in 1877.

Some inconsiderable remains of an aqueduct and theatre, about 7 miles to the north of Ronda, are supposed to represent the Acinipo or Arunda of ancient geographers. Ronda was taken from the Moors in 1485. It was the birthplace of Espinel.
