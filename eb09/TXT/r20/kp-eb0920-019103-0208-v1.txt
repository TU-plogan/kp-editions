RĀBĀN (ראב״ן)— i.e., Rabbenu Eli'ezer B. Nathan of Mainz—was one of the most famous Halakhic teachers of the 12th century. He lived at Mainz and corresponded with Rashi’s son-in-law, Rabbenu Meir b. Shemuel, and his three distinguished sons, Rashbam (7.v.), Ribain (R. Yishak b. Meir, who died young and left seven orphans), and Rabbenu Tham (R. Ya'akob). His great Halakhic work, צפנת פענח, or אבן העזר, is commonly called by the combination of the author’s initials which heads this article, the Book of Rābān, and was printed at Prague in 1610 fol. ^[1.] Other Halakhic literature by him is to be found in Kol Bo, § 123 (without place or date, but probably Naples, towards the end of the 15th century), and its reprints. More lies in MS. in libraries; thus the Eben Haroshah, of which no other copy is known, is preserved in the Cambridge University Library (Add., 498). R. Eli'ezer was also a fine liturgical poet, vying both in senti-ment and elegance with the poets of the Sèpharadic school, as appears, for example, from the Ophan and other pieces designed for a Sabbath when there is a circumcision. Rabbenu Eli'ezer died in the 12th century. The date 5007 ( = 1247) which appears in the formulas of a bill of divorcement and a deed of manumission of a slave is most assuredly due to a scribe of the 13th century, who in transcribing Räbän’s book conformed the date to his own time—a practice often to be met with.

Dr A. Jellinek of Vienna has published a History of the First Crusade (1קונטרס מרות תתנ״, Leipsic, 1854, 8vo)—a little book interesting in more than one way—which bears the name of Râbân. It cannot, however, be by the subject of this article, as one can see by comparing with his genuine work the questionable poetic stuff which forms part of the Konteres. The author is no doubt Räbän of Cologne. Nor does the commentary on אל אלהים (for Pentecost eve) under the title of מאמר השכל, which has been often printed, and of which the Cambridge Library has an old MS. (Add., 493, 1),

בדק לן and זבי לי מתנתא. The Tosaphoth and printed editions (ll.ee.) put Rabb āh (q.v.) for Rābā; but Rashi’s traditional reading (בך שמעתי) must be right. For, in the first place, it would have been on the part of the Talmud superfluous to state that Rabbāh and Abayye were of the house of Eli, seeing that the latter was the son of the brother of the former. And secondly, the story goes (Rosh Hasshanah, l.c.) that he who only studied the Law died at the age of forty (Abayye living to sixty), whereas the synchronisms of Rabbāh’s life show that he must have lived to a much greater age.

belong to this Rābān, though it has been ascribed to him for 600 years. Its writer was undoubtedly a Provençal. (S. M. S. - S. )
