ROCHESTER an episcopal city and municipal and parliamentary borough of Mid-Kent, is situated on the Medway, on the Medway Canal, and on the London, Chatham, and Dover and the South-Eastern railway lines, 33 miles east of London, contiguous to Chatham and Strood. Here the river is crossed by a railway bridge and by an iron swing bridge for carriage traffic, erected to take the place of a stone bridge destroyed in 1856. The present bridge occupies the site of that which spanned the Medway before the Conquest. On the eminence overlooking the right bank of the river and commanding a wide view of the surrounding country are the extensive remains of the Norman castle which is generally supposed to have been built by Gun-dulph, bishop of Rochester, towards the close of the llth century, and which was besieged by King John, by Simon de Montfort in the reign of Henry III., and in the reign of Richard II. by a party of rebels during the insurrection of Wat Tyler. It was repaired by Edward IV., but soon afterwards fell into decay, although the massive keep is still in good preservation. The cathedral was originally founded by Augustine in 604, but was partially destroyed by the Danes, and was rebuilt by Bishop Gundulph in the beginning of the 12th century. Though a comparatively small building, being only 310 feet in length and 68 in breadth at the nave, it is of considerable architectural interest, the most remarkable feature being the Norman west front with a richly sculptured door. There is a large number of monuments of great antiquity. In the garden of the deanery there are portions of the wall of St Andrew’s priory, founded about the same time as the cathedral. Among the principal public buildings of a secular character are the town-hall (1687), the corn exchange (1871), the county court offices (1862), the working men’s institute (1880), and the Richard Watts’s almshouses, in the Tudor style. Besides these almshouses there are a number of other charities. The principal schools are the cathedral grammar-school, founded in the reign of Henry VIII., and the Williamson mathematical school, formerly for the sons of freemen, but now open to all. The oyster fishing is of some importance, and there is a considerable shipping trade, a quay and landing-place having been erected by the corporation at great expense. In 1883 the number of vessels that entered the port was 5969 of 855,019 tons burden, and the number that cleared 5496 of 709,040 tons. There is a large steam-engine manufactory. Rochester returned two members to parliament down to 1885, when it was deprived of one. The population of the borough (area, ^[1. The parliamentary borough also includes 11,768 acres of tidal water and foreshore along the river Medway. ] 2909 acres) in 1871 was 18,352, and in 1881 it was 21,307; this includes 5395 persons in the town of Strood, situated on the opposite side of the Medway.

Rochester was the Durobrivae of the Romans, and was intersected by the Roman Watling Street from Canterbury. It was formerly surrounded with walls, of which there are still a few remains. It was the foundation of the cathedral by Ethelbert that first raised it to importance. By the Saxons it was named Hrofe-ceastre, which was gradually corrupted into the present name. In 676 it [9:20:614]was plundered by Ethelred, king of Mercia, and subsequently it suffered severely from the ravages of the Danes. About 930, when three mints were established there by Athelstan, it had grown to be one of the principal ports of the kingdom. λ∖ illiam the Conqueror granted the town to his half-brother Odo, bishop ot Bayeux, who, on account of his connexion in the conspiracy in favour of Robert, duke of Normandy, was besieged in the castle and deprived of his possessions. In 1130 and again in 1137 the city was nearly destroyed by fire. A grand tournament was held at the castle by Henry III. in 1251. The city was visited in 1522 by Henry VIII. accompanied by the emperor Charles V., and in 1573 Elizabeth remained there five days. Charles II. passed through it on his way to London at the Restoration, and at the Revolution James II. embarked at the port on his way to France. The bishop’s see was founded in 600, and the city received its first charter of incorporation from Henry II. in 1165. It has returned members to parliament since the 23d of Edward I.
