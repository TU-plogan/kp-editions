RICHERUS a chronicler of the 10th century, son of Rodulf, a trusty councillor and captain of Louis IV., studied at Rheims under Gerbert, afterwards Pope Silvester II. His intimacy with this famous man gave him many opportunities of knowing the history of his time, and when Gerbert became archbishop of Rheims he charged Richerus with the task of writing a history of the Gauls. This history in four books begins with Charles the Fat and Eudes, and goes down to the year 995. From 969 onwards Richerus had no earlier history before him, and his work is the chief source for the period when the Capets superseded the Carlovingians. It was first edited in Pertzâ€™s Monumenta Germaniae, vol. iii., and there have since been several separate editions.
