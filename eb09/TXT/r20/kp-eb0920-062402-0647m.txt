ROJAS-ZORILLA Francisco de, Spanish dramatist, a contemporary of Lope de Vega and Calderon, was born about the beginning of the 17th century. Of his personal history hardly anything has been recorded, but we know that he lived at Madrid, and about the year 1641 he seems to have become a knight of Santiago. Of his dramatic compositions some thirty still survive, which can be read in the 54th volume of the Biblioteca de Autores Espanoles (1861); the best by general consent is held to be that entitled Del Rey abajo Ninguno, otherwise known by the name of its hero as Garcia de CastaΓιar. Of the others, apart from their intrinsic merit, a double literary interest attaches to the No hay Padre siendo Rey, -which was borrowed by Rotrou for his Venceslas, to the Donde hay Agravios no hay Zelos and the Amo criado, which were imitated by Scarron in his Jodelet Souffleté and Maître Valet, and to the Entre Bobos anda el Juego, to which Thomas Corneille has acknowledged his obligations for his Bertrand de Cigarral. The Garcia de Castahar, Donde hay Agravios, and Entre Bobos anda el Juego are given by Ochoa in his Tesoro del Teatro Espahol.
