ROSTOFF on the Don, is one of those modern towns which have grown up with such remarkable rapidity in South Russia since the definite occupation by the Russians of the Black Sea coast. In 1731 a small fort was erected on an island in the Don, near its mouth. Thirty years later the fortifications were transferred to the site now occupied by Rostoff, 5 miles above the head of the first branch of the delta of the Don (Mertvyi Donets), and 13 miles above the real head of the delta, the fort being called Dmitri Rostovskiy. Settlers of all nationalities immediately gathered around it, and here within less than a century a city, which in 1881 had 70,700 inhabitants, sprung up, having a mixed population of Great Russians, Ukrainians, Greeks, Germans, Jews, &c. Rostoff stands on the elevated right bank of the Don, and, viewed from the river, looks fairly imposing; but the interior still retains the aspect of a large village.

The Don, which here has a breadth of no more than 230 to 250 yards, with a hardly perceptible current, offers an excellent roadstead. The navigation, however, is considerably impeded by the shallowness of the branches of the river, which are thirty in number at its entrance to the sea, but of which only three (Mertvyi Donetfe, Kolontcha, and the Don proper) are navigable. During the east winds, however, there is only 4 feet depth of water on the bars of the delta; and ships formerly were often compelled to stay outside for several weeks, waiting for a south-west wind. Recent dredging operations have but partially remedied this evil, and the goods have to be carried on lighters to Taganrog and Mariupol, where they are shipped. In 1882 only forty-one ships of small size coming from foreign countries under the Russian and Turkish flags entered the port, but no fewer than 3175 vessels (349,500 tons), engaged in cabotage or lighter traffic, left the roadstead. The export of corn, oil-seeds, wool, tallow, butter, iron, hides, ropes, coarse linen, pitch, &c., from 12,311,000 roubles in 1865, had risen to 41,634,252 roubles in 1882, while the imports were valued at only 886,120 roubles. The agricultural produce thus exported is drawn from the entire basin of the Don in central Russia, while ores and metals are brought from the Urals. The commercial importance of

Rostoff is further increased by its position on the great highway from Kharkolf and Voronezh to Caucasus, on which traffic has greatly increased since Rostoif became connected by rail with Kharkoff and Voronezh on the one side and A r Iadikavkaz on the other. Two fairs, one of which has considerable importance for the whole of south-eastern Russia, are yearly held here, with an estimated turnover of about 5,000,000 roubles. Rostoff has also excellent fisheries, and in summer it becomes the gathering place of many thousands of labourers on their way to assist in harvesting operations in the provinces of the Don and in northern Caucasia. The population then exceeds 100,000. The administrative position of Rostoff is quite unique. Along with a territory of 2520 square miles it belongs to the government of Ekaterinoslalf, of which it is a district town; but this territory is quite separated from the government, being enclosed by the territory of the Don Cossacks.
