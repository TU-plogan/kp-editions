RAIS Raiz, or Retz, Gilles de (d. 1410), marshal of France, seigneur of Hautpart and of many other lordships, who was hanged and burned at Nantes in 1440, has left a name connected directly with one of the most horrible stories in history, and indirectly with other curious matter. Not much is known of Rais before the trial which made his name infamous. He was of the noblest blood of the marches of Brittany, being on the father’s side of the Laval branch of the ducal family of Montfort, and being connected through his mother and by marriage with the houses of Craon, Thouars, and others. His possessions in the district from which he took his name, and which borders the estuary of the Loire on the south, as well as along the river, were great, and his chief seat was at ChamptocA He had served in the English wars with the credit of a brave knight, had a rather special reputation for devotion, had been marshal since 1429, and had held the alms-dish at the coronation of Charles VII. Suddenly he was arrested, tried, and, as above stated, executed on the evidence of accomplices and his own confession. The crimes with which he was charged extended over some fourteen years. During that period it was alleged that he had, through different agents, especially a AA'oman called La Meffraie, kidnapped or enticed to his various abodes large numbers (Monstrelet says 100, others 140) of children. These children, after being subjected to every outrage of lust and cruelty, Avere sacrificed to the devil, their blood used for magical ceremonies, their bodies burned, and their bones buried in the precincts of Rais’s castles. The ultimate purpose of this deAnl-worship Avas asserted to be the acquisition by Rais (who was assisted by divers sorcerers, especially an Italian imported for the purpose) of power and honours in the state. The depositions were A r ery full and still exist, and on them and his confession Rais Avas executed. It is, however, somewhat suspicious that the bishop of Nantes, who promoted, and the duke of Brittany, who sanctioned the proceedings, were both bitter personal enemies of Rais, Ailiile the king, who AA־as also concerned, had for a main part of his policy the putting doAvn of feudal barons ayIio, like Rais, held posts of vantage in the country. The tAA T o chief contemporary authors avIio mention the case, Monstrelet and Chastellain, speak of it Avith somewhat less horror than might, even alloAving for possible political sympathies, have been expected. Monstrelet (who says that Rais was charged Avith the murder of pregnant Avomen also) says that “many ladies and damsels” begged his body of the duke, and that great part of the nobles of Brittany, not only his relations, had great sorroAv and sadness for his death. Chastellain introduces the ghost of Rais in rather striking fashion in his Temple de Bocace as “folloAved by a multitude of little children crying ‘Vengeance.’” The affair affected public imagination as much because of the rarity of a criminal of such rank being brought to justice as of the heinousness of the crimes attributed to him. Locally it took a very strong hold of the popular mind, and a tradition not easy to trace connects it with the Bluebeard legend, which finally took shape in the hands of Perrault. This connexion, liOAvever, hardly bears examination. In the first place, there is no evidence that Rais ever was called Bluebeard, though a contemporary English adventurer A\'ho is mentioned by Holinshed Avas so called, and may have left a bad reputation in France. In the second, it is impossible to trace even the most superficial resemblance betAveen the stories. In Bluebeard there are no children concerned, no unnatural crimes, no sorcery; it is merely one of the numerous stories of “punished curiosity” so frequent in folk-lore. As it stands the Rais story is too horrible to make much of a figure in literature; but it has attracted some students of causes célèbres, notably Dumas fils in his Tristan le Roux.

For authorities besides the passages of Monstrelet and Chastellain above quoted, Michelet, Histoire de France, and Vallet de Viriville, Histoire de Charles VIL, may be consulted. Mézeray’s account, usually followed in books of reference, is loose; he had evidently not seen the records, nor even Monstrelet. But his assignment of a state crime against the duke as the real cause of death is very probable, though not formally correct.
