ROSELLINIIppolito (1800-1843), a native of Pisa and subsequently professor there of Oriental languages, in which Mezzofanti was his teacher, is best known as the associate of J. F. Champollion (y.u), whose studies he shared and whom he accompanied in his Egyptian explorations (1828). On the death of Champollion the publication of the results of their expedition fell to Rosellini (Monumenti delV Egitto e della Rubia, Florence, 1832-1840, 10 vols. fol.).
