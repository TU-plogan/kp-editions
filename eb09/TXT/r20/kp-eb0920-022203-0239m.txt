RAI BARELI or Roy Bareilly, a district of British India, in the Rai Bareli division ^[1. Rai Bareli division comprises the three districts of Rai Bareli, Sultanpur, and Partabgarh, and contains an area of 4882 square miles, with a population (1881) of 2,756,864 (males 1,362,761, females 1,394,103). The great majority of the people are Hindus, of whom there are 2,493,536; the Mohammedans number 262,892 and the Christians 226. ] of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, has an area of 1738 square miles. It lies between 25° 49' and 26° 35' N. lat. and between 80° 45' and 81° 40' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by the districts of Lucknow and Bara Banki, on the E. by Sultanpur, on the S. by Partabgarh and the Ganges, and on the W. by Unao. The general aspect of the district is slightly undulating, and the country is beautifully wooded; in fact, the beauty of the country is not to be surpassed by any part of the real plain of Hindustan. The soil is remarkably fertile, and the cultivation of a high class. The principal rivers of the district are the Ganges and the Sai: the former skirts it for 54 miles and is everywhere navigable for boats of 40 tons; the latter traverses it from north-west to south-east, a distance of 55 miles. Other rivers are the Basha, the Loni, and the Naiya. The indigenous products of Rai Bareli consist of several magnificent and useful timber trees, numerous kinds of grazing and thatching grasses, and a variety of rice known as “pasahi,” which grows wild in many tanks and marshes; its jungle products are lac and silk cocoons. Herds of wild cattle are to be found in the south of the district, near the Sai river, and do much harm to the crops; nylghau are common near the Ganges, and wolves are occasionally met with in the jungles.

According to the census of 1881 Rai Bareli district contains a population of 951,905 (males 466,906, females 484,999). By religion 874,180 are Hindus, 77,424 Mohammedans, and 123 Christians. The most numerous castes are the Ahirs (114,869), the Brahmans(113,212), and the Rajputs (70,757). Compared with other Oudh districts, the proportion of high castes is large, which is accounted for by the fact that Rai Bareli was for centuries the seat of Hindu authority and hut little controlled by the Mohammedan kings. The population is almost entirely rural, there being only three towns with a population exceeding 5000, viz., Rai Bareli (see below), Jais (11,044), and Dalmau (5367). The principal occupation of the people is agriculture. Of the total area 892 square miles were in 1882 returned as cultivated, 432 as cultivable, and 414 square miles as uncultivable. The greater portion of the cultivated area is two-crop land. The principal crops are rice, wheat, gram, arhar, and pease. In years of scarcity Rai Bareli is worse off than other districts, having no railway and only some 56 miles of water communication along its border. On the other hand, its masonry wells afford it a greater assurance against famine; its drainage is superior to that of other districts; it suffers comparatively less from floods; and its area of artificial irrigation is so large that absolute famine ought to be almost unknown. The average rainfall of the district is 37 inches; the rainfall is, however, very capricious and often deficient in the very months when it is most needed for agricultural purposes. Although possessing no railway communication, the district is well opened up by roads. Its gross revenue in 1882 was £153,072, of which £129,841 was derived from the land-tax. There are little trade and few manufactures, except cloth-weaving for local use, the making of brass and copper utensils, and glass ware.
