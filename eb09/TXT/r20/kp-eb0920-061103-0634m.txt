ROCHDALE a municipal and parliamentary borough of south-east Lancashire, is situated on the river Roch and on the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway, 11 miles north-north-east of Manchester and 12 east of Bolton. By means of the Rochdale Canal, extending from the duke of Bridgewater’s canal, Manchester, to the Calder and Hebble navigation at Sowerby Bridge, it has water communication with the most important towns in the north of England. Within recent years the town has largely increased. Though inhabited chiefly by the working classes, the streets generally are spacious and regular. The sanitary arrangements are very satisfactory, the main drainage having been executed on a very large scale. The gasworks and waterworks are in the hands of the corporation, which also erected public baths in 1868. There is a public cemetery belonging to the corporation, and also a public [9:20:612]park 12 acres in extent. The parish church of St Chad, occupying the high grounds overlooking the town, is built on the site of a church which was erected in the 12th century. The town-hall is a very extensive and elaborate structure in the Decorated Gothic style, and had originally a tower surmounted by a gilded spire 140 feet in height, which was destroyed by fire in 1883. The building, completed in 1871 at a cost of £150,000, includes a large lιall for public meetings and various municipal rooms. For the free public library, with about 40,000 volumes, a new building was opened in. 1884. Of the educational charities the principal are the Archbishop Parker free grammar-school, founded in 1565, and the free English school. Among the other public institutions are the infirmary (lately much enlarged), the literary and scientific society, and the art society. The staple manufactures are those of woollens and cottons. There are, besides, foundries, iron-works, and machine-factories. Coal and stone are obtained extensively in the neighbourhood of the town. Rochdale was the birthplace of the co-operative movement. The town was first incorporated in 1856 and divided into three wards, but when the area of the municipal borough was extended and made coextensive -with the parliamentary borough it was divided into ten wards, governed by a mayor, ten aldermen, and thirty councilmen. Rochdale has returned one member to the House of Commons since the Reform Act of 1832. The population of the borough (area, 4172 acres) in 1871 was 63,485, and in 1881 it was 68,866.

In early times Rochdale was situated entirely in the township of Castleton, where at one time stood the castle which gave its name to the township. Near the town are the remains of a Roman road leading over the Blackstone Edge Hills, which separate Lancashire and Yorkshire. The name Rochdale appears in Domesday Book as Reeedam, and it was subsequent to the Norman Conquest that the town began to spread into the valley of the Roch. From the time of William the Conqueror the manor and estates were held by the De Lacys, but after some centuries they became merged in the crown. By Elizabeth they were bestowed on Sir John Byron, and in 1823 they were sold by Lord Byron the poet to James Dearden, in whose family they now remain. The town obtained a charter for a market in the reign of Richard I.; this charter was confirmed by Henry III., who added the privilege of holding an annual fair.
