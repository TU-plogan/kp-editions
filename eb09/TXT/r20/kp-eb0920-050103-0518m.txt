REWAH the principal native state in Bâghelkhand, under the political superintendence of the Bâghelkhand and Central India Agencies. It has an area of about 10,000 square miles, and lies between 22° 39' and 25° 12' N. lat., and between 80° 46' and 82° 51' E. long.; it is bounded on the N. by the British districts of Banda, Allahabad, and Mirzapur in the North-Western Provinces; on the E. by Mirzapur district and by native states in Chutia-Nagpur; on the S. by the districts of Chhatisgarh, Mandla, and Jabalpur in the Central Provinces; and on the W. by other native states of Bhâgelkhand. Rewah state is divided into two well-defined portions. The northern and smaller division is the plateau lying between the Kaimur range of hills and that portion of the Vindhyas [9:20:502]known as Binjh, which overlook the valley of the Ganges. This plateau is for the most part cultivated and well peopled; the soil varies from a rich black loam to a sandy laterite; but in the greater part of this area good land predominates, and rich harvests both of kharif and rabi crops are generally obtained. Water is plentiful, and the country is full of large tanks and reservoirs, which, however, are not used for irrigation purposes; the only system of wet cultivation which has any favour with the villagers is that of bandhs, or mounds of earth raised at the lower ends of sloping fields to retain the rain water for some time after the monsoon rains cease. The Rewah plateau is reported to possess every natural advantage, and the whole of its area could be brought under rich cultivation. The country to the south of the Kaimur Hills comprises by far the largest portion of the state; but here cultivation is restricted to the valley between the hills and the Sone river, and to a few isolated patches in scattered parts of the wild and magnificent forest wastes. Rewah is rich in minerals and forests. Operations lately undertaken to determine the extent of its coal fields have proved highly successful. Until very recently Rewah possessed no roads to speak of or means of internal communication; but good progress is now being made, and by this means it is anticipated that the state will soon develop its rich resources. The principal river is the

•Sone, which, receiving the Mahanadi from the south, flows through the state in a north and north-easterly direction into Mirzapur district; another important river is the Tons; but none of the rivers are navigable. The average rainfall at Rewah is about 57∣ inches.

K The population of the state in 1881 was 1,305,124 (654,182 males, 650,942 females); Hindus in the same year numbered 971,788, Mohammedans 31,107, and aboriginals 302,107. The inhabitants of Rewah are reported to be a singularly simple, pleasant, and well-disposed race, and they greatly appreciate the efforts which are now being made to benefit them. The revenue of the state in 1882-83 amounted to £110,946, of which the land contributed £71,798. The chief town is Rewah, situated in 24° 31' 30" N. lat. and 81° 20' E. long., and containing in 1881 a population of 22,016.

The state came under British influence in 1812, when the first formal treaty was made with Jai Sinh Deo, by which he was acknowledged as ruler of his dominions and was brought under the protection of the British Government. The raja, however, failed to fulfil his obligations, and a second treaty was made confirming the first and defining more clearly his relations with the British Government. The administration of Rewah is now entirely in the hands of the British owing to the death of the maharaja Raghuraj Sinh and the succession of his infant son.
