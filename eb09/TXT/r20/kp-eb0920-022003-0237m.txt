RAGLANFitzroy James Henry Somerset, Baron (1788-1855), English general, was the eighth and youngest son of the fifth duke of Beaufort by Elizabeth, daughter of Admiral the Hon. Edward Boscawen, and was born on 30tli September 1788. He entered the army in 1804. In 1807 he was attached to the Hon. Sir Arthur Paget’s embassy to Turkey, and the same year he ־« ’ as selected to serve on the staff of Sir Arthur Wellesley in the expedition to Copenhagen. In the following year he accompanied the same general in a like capacity to Portugal, and during the whole of the Peninsular War was at his right hand, first as aide-de-camp and then as military secretary. He specially distinguished himself at the storming of Badajoz, being the first to mount the breach, and it was to him that the governor delivered up his sword. During the short period of the Bourbon rule in 1814 and 1815 he was secretary to the English embassy at Paris. On the renewal of the war he again became aide-de-camp and military secretary to the duke of Wellington. At Waterloo he lost his right arm by a shot, but he quickly gained the facility of writing with his left hand, and on the conclusion of the war resumed his duties as secretary to the embassy at Paris. From 1818 to 1826 he sat in the House of Commons as member for Truro. In 1819 he was appointed secretary to the duke of Wellington as master-general of the ordnance, and from 1827 till the death of the duke in 1852 was military secretary to him as commander-in-chief. He was then appointed master-general of the ordnance, and shortly afterwards was raised to the House of Lords as Baron Raglan. In 1854 he was appointed to the command of the English troops sent to the Crimea. Here the advantage of his training under the duke of Wellington was seen in the soundness of his military tactics, but the trying ־« ’ inter campaign in the Crimea also brought into prominence defects perhaps traceable to his long connexion with the formalities and uniform regulations of military offices in peace time. At the same time the hampering influence of a divided command must be taken into account, and it ought not to be forgotten that, if his advice had been adopted by the French at the beginning, Sebastopol would very probably have fallen in a few weeks after the landing of the allies. His suggestion was to march straight upon the north side of Sebastopol, but after the battle of Alma on 20th September the plan was abandoned, and the south side was reached by the desperate expedient of a perilous flank march. For the hardships and sufferings of the English soldiers in the terrible Crimean winter o« 7 ing to a failure in the commissariat, both as regards food'and clothing, Lord Raglan and his staff were at the time severely censured by the press and the Government; but, while Lord Raglan was possibly to blame in representing matters in a too sanguine light, it afterwards appeared that the chief neglect rested with the home authorities. The monotony of the siege was broken by the battles of Balaclava on 26th October and of Inkermann on 5th November, in which the accurate and rapid decision of Lord Raglan changed impending disasters into brilliant victories. During the trying ’ « , inter of 1854-55 the suffering he « ’ as compelled to witness, the censures, in great part unjust, which he had to endure, and all the manifold anxieties of the siege seriously undermined his health, and he died of dysentery on 28th June 1855.
