REFEREE in law, is a person to whom a matter is delegated by a superior for report or decision. The principal use of the word occurs in the practice of the House of Commons and of the High Court of Justice. The Court of Referees is a court to which the House of Commons commits the decision of all questions of locus standi ,—that is, the right of petitioners to be heard in opposition to private Bills. A referee is also associated with members of the House as a member of every committee on an opposed Bill, but may not vote. Under the Judicature Act, 1873, cases are submitted to either official or special referees for inquiry and report, or for trial. Inquiry and report may be directed in any case,—trial only by consent of the parties, or in any matter requiring any prolonged examination of documents or accounts, or any scientific or local investigation which cannot be tried in the ordinary way (36 and 37 Vict. c. 66, ss. 56, 57; Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord. xxxvi.).
