ROSSE William Parsons, third Earl of (1800-1867), the distinguished constructor of reflecting telescopes, was born at York on June 17, 1800, a son of the second earl, who as Sir Lawrence Parsons, Bart., had been a prominent member of the Irish Parliament. Until his father’s death (1841) he was known as Lord Oxmantown. He was M.P. for King’s County from 1821 to 1834, Irish representative peer from 1845, president of the Royal Society from 1848 to 1854, and chancellor of the university of Dublin from 1862. From 1827 he devoted himself to the improvement of reflecting telescopes; in 1839 he mounted a telescope of 3 feet aperture at his seat, Birr Castle, Parsonstown; andin 1845 his celebrated 6-foot reflector was finished. Owing to the famine and the disturbed state of the country, which demanded his attention as a large landowner and lieutenant of King’s County, the instrument remained unused for nearly three years, but since 1848 it has been in constant use, chiefly for observations of nebulae, for which it was particularly suited on account of its immense optical power. Lord Rosse died on October 31, 1867.

The first constructor of reflecting telescopes on a large scale, William Herschel, never published anything about his methods of casting and polishing specula, and he does not appear to have been very successful beyond specula of 18 inches diameter, his 4-foot speculum (“the 40-foot telescope”) having been very little used by him (about this question see an interesting discussion between Sir J. Herschel and Robinson in The Athevxeurn, Nos. 831-36, 1843, which deserves to be rescued from, oblivion). Lord Rosse had therefore no help whatever in working his way from a small beginning to the brilliant results he achieved. Hisspeculum metal is composed of four equivalents of copper and one of tin, a very brilliant alloy, which resists tarnish better than any other compound tried. Chiefly owing to the extreme brittleness of this material, Lord Rosse’s first larger specula were composed of a number of thin plates of speculum metal (sixteen for a 3-foot mirror) soldered on the back of a strong but light framework made of a peculiar kind of brass (2 - 75 of copper to 1 of zinc), which has the same expansion as his speculum metal. In Brewster’s Edinburgh Journal of Science for 1828 he described his machine for polishing the speculum, which in all essential points remained unaltered afterwards. It imitates the motions made in polishing a speculum by hand by giving both a rectilinear and a lateral motion to the polisher, while the speculum revolves slowly; by shifting two eccentric pins the course of the polisher can be varied at will from a straight line to an ellipse of very small eccentricity, and a true parabolic figure can thus be obtained. The speculum lies face upwards in a shallow bath of water (to preserve a uniform temperature), and the polisher fits loosely in a ring, so that the rotation of the speculum makes it revolve also, but more slowly. Both the grinding and polishing tools are grooved, to obtain a uniform distribution of the emery used in the grinding process and of the rouge employed in polishing, as also to provide for the lateral expansion of the pitch with which the polisher is coated. In September 1839 a 3-foot speculum was finished and mounted on an altazimuth stand similar to HerscheFs; but, though the definition of the images was good (except that the diffraction at the joints of the speculum caused minute rays in the case of a very bright star), and its peculiar skeleton form allowed the speculum to follow atmospheric changes of temperature very quickly, Lord Rosse decided to cast a solid 3-foot speculum. Hitherto it had been felt as a great difficulty in casting specula that the solidification did not begin at one surface and proceed gradually to the other, the common sand mould allowing the edges to cool first, so that the central parts were subject to great straining when their time of cooling came, and in large castings this generally caused cracking. By forming the bottom of the mould of hoop iron placed on edge and closely packed, and the sides of sand, while the top was left open, Lord Rosse overcame this difficulty, and the hoop iron had the further advantage of allowing the gas developed dufing the cooling to escape, thus preventing the speculum from being full of [9:20:856]pores and cavities. This happy invention secured the success of the casting of a solid 3-foot speculum in 1840, and encouraged Lord Rosse to make a speculum of 6 feet diameter, which he also succeeded in doing in 1842. In the beginning of 1845 this great reflector (which up to the present time has remained without a rival) was mounted and ready for work. The instrument has a focal length of 54 feet and the tube is about 7 feet in diameter; owing to these large dimensions it cannot be pointed to every part of the heavens, but can only be moved a short distance from the meridian and very little to the north of the zenith; these restrictions have, however, hardly been felt, as there is almost at any moment a sufficient number of objects within its reach. From 1848 to 1878 it was with but few interruptions employed for observations of nebulae; and many previously unknown features in these objects were revealed by it, especially the remarkable spiral configuration prevailing in many of the brighter nebulae. A special study was made of the nebula of Orion, and the resulting large drawing gives an extremely good representation of this complicated object. Since 1845 others have followed in Lord Rosse’s footsteps and several 3- and 4-foot mirrors have been made, while the development of refracting telescopes has been so rapid that, whereas twenty-five years ago there were no object glasses larger than 15 inches in existence, a 30-inch glass has now actually been completed. But, though the refractors surpass the large reflectors in general convenience of use and are very much better adapted to work of precision (micrometer measures), Lord Rosse’s great reflector is still unapproached in light-grasping power, and remains a noble monument of'its maker, who (as beautifully expressed on a memorial tablet in the parish church of Birr) “revealed to mankind by the unrivalled creation of his genius a wider vision of the glory of God.”

Lord Rosse gave a detailed account of the experiments which step by step had led to the construction of the 3-foot speculum in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840. In the same publication for 1844 and 1850 he communicated short descriptions and drawings of some of the more interesting nebulae, and in the volume for 18G1 he published a paper On the Construction of Specula of 6 feet aperture, and a Selection from the Observations of Nebulae made with them, with numerous engravings. The accounts of the observations given in these papers were, however, of a very fragmentary character; but in 1879-80 a complete account of them was published by the present earl (“Observations of nebulae and clusters of stars made with the 6-footand 3-foot reflectors at BirrCastlefrom 1848 to 1878”) in the Scient. Trans. R. Dublin Soc., vol. H. The drawing of the nebula of Orion was published in the Phil. Trans, for 1868.
