REED a term applied to several distinct species of large, water-loving grasses. The common or water reed, Phragmites communis, Trin. (Arundo pliragmites , L.), occurs along the margins of lakes, fens, marshes, and placid streams, not only throughout Britain but over the Palae-arctic and Nearctic regions, and even in South Australia. Another very important species is Psamma arenaria, R. and S. ( Ammophila or Arundo arundinacea, Host.), the sea-reed or marram grass, a native of the sandy shores of Europe and North Africa. Both species have been of notable geological importance, the former binding the soil and so impeding denudation, and actually converting swamp into dry land, largely by the aid of its tall (5 to 10 feet) close set stems, which not only break the currents of water around them, and so cause deposition of their sediment, but furnish in themselves an important annual contribution to the incipient soil. The latter species, of which the branching rootstocks may be traced 30 or even 40 feet, is of still greater importance in holding sand-dunes against the encroachments of the sea, and for this purpose has not only been long protected by law but has been extensively planted on the coasts of Norfolk, Holland, Gascony, &c. Other reeds are Calamagrostis (various species), Gynérium argenteum (pampas grass), Deyeuxia, &c., also Arundo Donax, the largest European grass (6 to 12 feet high), which is abundant in southern Europe. Reeds have been extensively used from the earliest times in thatching and in other branches of construction, and also for arrows, the pipes of musical instruments, &c. Reed pens are still used in the East (see Pen). Plants belonging to other orders occasionally share the name, especially the bur-reed ( Sparganium ) and the reed-mace ( Typha ), both belonging to the natural order Typhaceee. The bulrushes ( Scirpus ), belonging to the natural order Cyperacese, are also to be distinguished. See Grasses; also Sowerby’s British Grasses, &c.
