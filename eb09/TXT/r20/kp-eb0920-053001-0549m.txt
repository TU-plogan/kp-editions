RHYL a watering-place of North Wales, in the county of Flint, is situated near the mouth of the Clwyd, 30 miles north-west of Chester and 10 north-north-west of Denbigh, a railway line to which here joins that from Chester to Holyhead. Only recently it was a small fishing village. Its chief advantages as a watering-place are the pure air and extensive firm sands. Although the situation of the town was formerly bare and cheerless, much has been done to improve it. There are many handsome houses, and the neighbouring country is interesting both from its scenery and from its castles and other ancient buildings. The town possesses a town-hall, extensive winter gardens, racquet courts, lawn-tennis grounds, and other attractions. The east and west parades face the sea, and the pier, constructed of iron, is 700 feet in length. There is daily communication by steamer with Liverpool, Llandudno, Bangor, Ac. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 600 acres) in 1871 was 4500, and in 1881 it was 6029.
