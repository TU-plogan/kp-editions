RATAFIA is a term applied to a flavouring essence, the basis of which is the essential oil of bitter almonds. Peach kernels are properly the source of ratafia, but any of the other substances yielding bitter almond oil is used. The name “ratafia” is also applied in France to a variety of liquors, and from Dantzic a special liqueur is sent out under the name of “ratafia” (see vol. xiv. p. 686).
