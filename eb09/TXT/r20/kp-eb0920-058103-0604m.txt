RIZZIO David, a servant of Mary, queen of Scots, was, according to Buchanan, a native of Turin, and came to Scotland in 1561 in the train of the Piedmontese ambassador. He entered the queenâ€™s service as a musician in 1564, and was also employed by her as private foreign secretary. He was murdered in 1566, as has been related in the article Mary (vol. xv. p. 596).
