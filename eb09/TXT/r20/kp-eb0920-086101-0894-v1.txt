ROSTOCK the largest town of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, and one of the most important commercial cities on the Baltic, is situated on the left bank of the estuary of the Warnow, about eight miles from the sea. It lies 177 miles north-west of Berlin by railway, 80 miles north-east of Lübeck, and 106 miles south of Copenhagen. The city consists of three parts—the old town to the east, and the middle and new towns to the west—of which the first retains some of the antique features of an old Hanse town, while the last two are for the most part regularly and even handsomely built. There are several fine squares in Rostock, among them the Blücher Platz, with a statue of Field-marshal Blücher, who was born in the town in 1742. Rostock was at one time a fortress of some strength, but the old fortifications have been razed, and their site is noλv occupied by a promenade. Within the last twenty years the suburbs have considerably extended themselves. Rostock has five old parochial churches :—St Mary’s, dating from 1398-1472, one of the most imposing Gothic buildings in Mecklenburg; St Nicholas’s, begun about 1250 and restored in 1450; St Peter’s, with a lofty tower built in 1400, which serves as a landmark to ships 20 miles at sea; St James’s, completed in 1588; and the church of the Holy Rood, begun in 1270, but now no longer used for service. St Mary’s church contains a monument marking the original tomb of Grotius, who died in Rostock in 1645, though his remains were afterwards removed to Delft. Among the other interesting buildings are the curious 14th-century Gothic town-house, the façade of which is concealed by a Renaissance addition; the palace of the grand duke of Mecklenburg-SchAverin, built in 1702; the law courts, built in 1878-79; and the new university buildings, erected in 1867-70. The university of Rostock was founded in 1418 by the dukes Johann III. and Albrecht V. From 1437 till 1443 it had its seat at Greifswald in consequence of commotions at Rostock; and in 1760 it was again removed—on this occasion to Bützow. The professors appointed by the city, however, still taught there, so that there were practically two universities in the duchy until 1789, when they were reunited at the original seat. In winter 1884-5 the university had a teaching staff of 39, with 265 students; and it possesses a library of 145,000 volumes, various collections and museums, and a number of scientific and literary auxiliary institutions. Rostock is the seat of the supreme court for both the duchies of Mecklenburg, and is well equipped with schools, hospitals, and other institutions. The population in 1810 was 10,979; in 1880 it was 36,967, of whom only 224 were Roman Catholics, and only 221 were Jews; in 1885 it was 39,212.

Although the population, commerce, and wealth of Rostock have all declined since its palmy days as a flourishing Hanse town in the Middle Ages, it has still a very considerable trade, and no Baltic port possesses so large a merchant fleet. In 1882 314 ships, with a total burden of 97,447 tons, were registered as belonging to Rostock; and in 1832 730 ships, with a total burden of 80,578 tons entered, and 724 ships, with a total burden of 82,537 tons, cleared, the port. Ships of more than 200 tons burden must discharge part of their cargo at AVarnemiinde, at the mouth of the Warnow, the port of Rostock, a fishing village and watering place with 1766 inhabitants, who are distinguished by a peculiar dialect and costume. By far the most important export of Rostock is grain, which goes almost entirely to British ports; but wool, flax, and cattle are also shipped. The chief imports are coal from Great Britain, herrings from Sweden, petroleum from America, timber, wine, and colonial goods. Rostock has an important fair at Whitsuntide, lasting for fourteen days, and also a frequented wool and cattle market. The industries of the town are very varied. One of the chief ^is shipbuilding, which, however, has declined of late years. Cotton, straw hats, tobacco, carpets, soap, cards, chocolate, and dye-stuffs are among the manufactures of the town, which also contains distilleries, saw-mills, oil-mills, tanneries, and breweries.

Local historians assert that a village existed on the site of Rostock as early as 329 A.υ., but no certain proofs have been traced of any earlier community than that founded here by Pribislaw IL in the 12th century, which is said to have received town rights in 1218. The earliest signs of commercial prosperity date from about 1260. For a time Rostock was under the dominion of the kings of Denmark. Soon after returning into the protection of Mecklenburg in 1317, it joined the Hanseatic League; and in fact was one of the original members of the powerful and prosperous AVendish Hansa, in [9:20:862]which it exercised an influence second only to that of Lübeck. The most prosperous epoch of its commercial history began in the latter half of tho 15th century, precisely at the period when its political power began to wane. Rostock, however, never entirely lost the independence which it enjoyed as a Hanse town; and in 1788, as the result of long contentions with the rulers of SIecklenburg, it secured for itself a peculiar and liberal municipal constitution, administered by three burgomasters and three chambers. In 1880 this constitution was somewhat modified, and the city became less like a state within a state. The badge of Rostock is the figure’7; and a local rhyme explains that there are 7 doors to St Mary’s church, 7 streets from the market place, 7 gates on the landward side and 7 wharves on the seaward side of the town, 7 turrets on the town-house, which has 7 bells, and 7 linden trees in the park.
