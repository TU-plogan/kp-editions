ROACH(Leuciscus rutilw), a fish of the family of Carps (Cyprinidae) and of the genus Leuciscus, which comprises also the Rudd, Chub, and Dace. It is one of the most common freshwater fishes of Europe north of the Alps, and extends northwards as far as Lapland. Its pharyngeal teeth are in a single series, five or six on each side. The body is generally rather deep, its greatest depth being about one-third of the total length, the caudal fin not included. The scales are large, from forty-two to forty-four along the lateral line, seven or eight series being above it, and three between the lateral line and ventral fin. The first dorsal rays are inserted vertically above, but not in advance of the root of the ventral fin. The anal fin is supported by from twelve to fourteen rays. The general colour is silvery, in adult fishes with a red tinge about the lower fins. Roach spawn from April to May, and frequently produce hybrids with other allied fishes, such as the rudd and the bream. They never attain to a large size, a roach of 1 â…œ II) being considered an unusually large fish. As a food-fish this species is not held in esteem; but by the pleasure it affords to a large class of humble anglers it rivals any of the freshwater fishes which give more pretentious sport, and has properly been made the subject of a special work, The Book of the Roach, by Greville Fennell (London, 1870).
