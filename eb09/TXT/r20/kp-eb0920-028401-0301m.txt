RASHI (v׳ cn), that is, Rabbenu Shelomoh Yishaki (Solomon, son of Isaac), whence by Christian writers he is also called Isacides ^[1. The interpretation of the י of רש״י as meaning Yarchi (Jarchi), i.e., of Lunel, is not to be charged on Buxtorf, nor on Seb. Münster, being already found in the text of the Pugio Fidei of Raymundus Martini, written in the second half of the 13th century. ] (1010-1105), was the greatest rabbi of the Middle Ages. He is equally important for Biblical and Talmudic study, and in the former connexion as interesting to Christians as to Jews from the influence of his exegesis on Luther’s Bible (through De Lyra; see vol. xi. p. 601) and on the English version of the Old Testament (mainly through Ibn 'Ezra, and still more through Kimlii). Raslii is the most eminent of the “sages” or “great men of Lothaire” ^[2. Lothaire never means Lhuitre (Luistre), as appears from the phrase ] (Tnib, i.e., Lorraine) in whom culminated that movement of Jewish scholarship to which Charlemagne had given the first impulse. From the Jew Isaac, first interpreter and then ambassador in his famous mission to HArun ar-Rashfd, Charlemagne had doubtless learned how superior in literary attainments the Jews of the East were to those of the West, and therefore he gave great privileges to the accomplished Makhirites ^[3. מלכות לותיר, “realm of Lothaire.” Instead of עיר ליתיר in Rashi’s ] who were introduced into the south of France, and spread Jewish culture and literature there. ^[4. so-called Siddur, ii. leaf 33a, must be read ערי לותיר, as will be easily seen from the context. ] Later on he brought from Rome to Mainz the Kalonymites, a family of distinguished Talmudists, poets, Ac., of Lucca; ^[5. See Yolmsin Hasshalem (London and Edinburgh, 1857, 8vo), p.84. ] and soon Spires, Worms, and Mainz (spoken of as Shum,D״Vw>) became famous seats of Jewish learning; their ordinances (Takkanoth Shum) were of normative authority for centuries, and the study of the Hebrew Bible and the Babylonian Talmud steadily spread from southern Germany to northern France. Though Spires, Worms, and Mainz by the partition treaty of Verdun in 843 belonged to East Frankland, yet in Jewish literature Lothaire includes these cities; and all the greatest doctors of Jewish lore in the south of Germany or north of France belong to the “great men” or “sages of Lothaire.” ^[6. Possibly also, like some princes of the 10th century, Charlemagne encouraged Jewish literature in order to keep at home the considerable sums which the Jews had been wont to send to the Babylonian geonim. ] Rashi was born, in the year in which the last nominal gaon of Pumbaditha died, at Troyes, where his father Yishak: was no doubt rabbi. R. Yishak was probably a disciple of R. Gershom; certainly he was an eminent Talmudist. ^[7. See 'Emek JIabbakha, ed. Letteris (Vienna, 1852, 12mo), p. 13, and Wiener’s German translation (Leipsic, 1858, 8vo), p. 8. Reshal’s Responsa, § xxix., is unfortunately corrupt in many places. ] His wife, Rashi’s mother, was a sister of R. Shime'on hazzaken. ^[8. See Brit. Mus. MS. Add. 27200, leaf 24a. ]

Her name is unknown, as is also that of the wife whom Rashi, according to Mishnic precept (Aboth, v. 21), married at the age of eighteen. Soon after his marriage, and with his wife’s consent, he left her to prosecute his studies in Germany, returning home only from time to time. ^[9. This appears from an explanation quoted from him by his son ] She bore him no sons, but three daughters. ^[10. on a passage of ' Abodah Zarah (f. 75a, catchword לא פליגי)). This treatise was at that time scarcely studied, even by eminent rabbis, and the explanation is markedly superior to one which Rashi also gives from R. Ya'akob b. Yakar, hitherto regarded as the most eminent of his teachers. ]

Rashi had at least six teachers,—(1) his father; (2) R. Ya'akob b. Yakar (chief rabbi at Worms) for Bible and Talmud (Rashi on T. B., Pesahim, 111a), a disciple of R. Gershom (Rashbam, ibid., and Siddur, ii. leaf 10a) and friend of R. Eli'ezer liaggadol; (3) his successor, R. Yishak Segan Leviyyah (T.B., Besah, 24b), a pupil of R. Eli'ezer haggadol; (4) his mother’s brother, already named (T.B., Shabbath, 85b); (5) R. Yishak b. Yehudah, also a pupil of R. Eli'ezer, and head of the community at Mainz (Pardes, xxi.); (6) R. Elyakim, head of the community at Spires (ibid., clix., clxxxi., ccxc., cccvi.). Besides the oral instruction of his teachers, Rashi had and used copies of, and commentaries on, sundry parts of the Talmud written by these scholars themselves or by their teachers or disciples (T. B., Berdkhoth, 39a, 57b; Shabbath, 10b; R. Hasshanah, 28a; Sukkah, 45b; Siddur, ii. leaf 10a). He had also before him all the Jewish literature existing and known at his time, as the Bible, part of the Apocrypha, all the Targums, sundry cabbalistic works (Sepher Yesirah, Hekhaloth, Ac. ^[11. Not to be confounded with his older contemporary, the poet and Halakhist, Shime'on b. Yishak haggadol. The epithets “hazzaken” and “haggadol” both mean “the elder,” but the epithet is varied to distin-guish the persons. ] ), both Talmuds, the Midrashim, Sheeltoth, Halakhoth Gedoloth, Teshuboth Haggeonim, the works of R. Mosheh Haddarshan, the lexicographical works of Menahem b. Seruk and Donash b. Labrat, and, last but not least, the commentaries of R. Gershom, which he used largely, but mostly silently. ^[12. See Hoplies Matmonim, ed. Goldberg, p. 2 (ורחיים בצוואר שמשתי ] He also used the works of his own contemporaries, such as the ' Arukh ^[13. They married three of their father’s disciples. The husband of the eldest was, according to Schiller-Szinessy ( Camb. Cat., ii. 88 sq., note 1), R. Simhah of Vitry-le-Fran^ais (ob. 1105), reputed author of the Mahzor Vitri, which, if the other MSS. so called have no better title to the name than that in the British Museum, Add. 27200-1, must now be regarded as lost (Taylor, Catal. MSS. of Aboth, &c., No. 20; Schiller-Szinessy, op. cit., ii. 61 sq.). The issue of this marriage was (1) R. Shema'yah of Soissons (see Mishnah, vol. xvi. p. 506); (2) R. Shemuel, who married his cousin, Rashbam’s only sister. Rashi’s second daughter, Yokhebed, married R. Meir of Rameru (b. Shemuel), a brother of R. Simhah. He was father of four sons,— (1) Ribam (R. Yishak b. Meir), who died in his father’s lifetime; (2) Rashbam (q.v.) ; (3) R. Tham or Rath; (4) R. Shelomoh (Br. Mus., Add. 27200,leaf 158b). The third daughter, Miryam, married R. Yehudah b. Nathan, who sup-plemented his father-in-law’s commentary on Makkoth, and wrote the commentary that goes by Rashi’s name on T. B., Nazir, &c. Their son’s name was R. Yom Tob ( Sepher Hayyashar, Vienna, 1810, § 599). ] His studies completed, Rashi returned to his native town and opened a school for Bible and Talmud. His fame quickly rose; disciples gathered round him from the whole north of France and south of Germany, and men in office, who had grown grey in study, addressed to him “religious questions,” his “answers” to which give us insight into his character, piety, and ability. ^[14. See Rashi, T. B., Berakhoth, 51a; Hagigah, 13a; Sukkah, 45a; and many other places. See also Siddur, ii. leaf 22b, col. 2 (on the reading of the Shema' in bed). Such passages as Kiddushin, 71 a, do not, when rightly understood, testify to the contrary. Rashi’s “they” refers not to his contemporary teachers, but to those of the Talmud who “had not explained to us the Holy Names of the Twelve and Forty-two.” It is therefore quite untrue that Rashi “knew nothing of kabbalah.” ] He died on 13th (not 26th) July 1105, ^[15. R. Gershom, “the light of the Diaspora” (see vol. xvi. p. 506), died in the year in which Rashi was born, and was the immediate teacher of his teachers. One of his commentaries is printed in the Shittah Mekubbeselh on Karethoth, Vienna, 1878, folio. ] having already seen two of his grandsons “in-

terpreting ’ in 111s presence, and the budding intelligence of a third, ־who became the greatest Talmudist of his age.

Rashi, though not the originator of all that he teaches in his commentary on the Talmud, had so digested the whole literature bearing on that stupendous work that his teaching, even when it appears to be imitative, is really creative. In his Biblical com-mentaries he has not, of course, grammatical and philological knowledge of the modern type, but he had a very fine sense for linguistic points, which was not equalled, much less surpassed, by the greatest rabbis who followed him. He gave satisfaction, if not to all, at least to the best of his time, and, as the great German poet says, “he who has given satisfaction to the best of his time lives for all ages.”

Rashi’s Works. —A. Bible Commentary (פרוש).—Rashi commented on the whole of the Hebrew Bible except Job, chaps, xl. 21 to the end, and the books of Chronicles. ^[16. The supplement to the former is generally ascribed to R. Ya’akob Nazir; its relation to the author of the MS. commentary on Job (Camb. Univ. Lib., Dd. 8. 53) has still to be worked out. The commentary on Chronicles in which Rashi is three times cited by name (2 Chron. iii. 15, xxii. 11, and xxiii. 14) is the work of a German rabbi residing in Provence. ] Kimhi’s is the only Rabbinical commentary which can be said to have successfully approached this great work in its influence on Jewish scholarship; and on the Pentateuch Rashi had no rival. For centuries too his was the text-book in boys’ schools throughout the Jewish world—and in some countries it is so still, its depth and subtilty being com-bined with simplicity of exposition. Its currency is attested by more than a hundred supercommentaries, translations, extracts, and the like, of which there are about fifty in print. An eminent rabbi declares that Rashi may be substituted for the Targum “in the reading of the weekly pericope” (Reshal, Yam shcl Shelomoh on Kiddushin, ii. § 14). Rashi’s influence on Christian scholars has already been alluded to. N. de Lyra copied him so closely as to be called his “ape.” ^[17. See J. H. Maius, Vita Reuchlini, 1687, Prsef. The thanks of the present writer are due to the curators and librarian of the Bodleian for the loan of this book. ] Translations. —The whole commentary was rendered into Latin by Pellicanus (q.v .), but never printed, and again by Breithaupt (3 vols. 4to, Gotha, 1710-14). This version includes the spurious commentary on Chronicles and is accompanied by notes. Of separate parts there are printed versions of Gen. i.-vi. (Scherzer, 1663), Gen. vi.-xi. (Abicht, 1705), Gen. xlix. (Loscani, 1710), Hosea (Mercier,

1621) , Joel, Jonah (Leusden, 1656), Joel (Genebrard, 1563), Jonah, Zephaniali, Obadiah (Pontac, 1556), Obadiah (Crocius, 1673), Malachi (S. de Muis, 1618), Ps. xix. (Id., 1620), Proverbs (Giggieus, 1620), Canticles (Genebrard, 1570), Ruth (Carpzov, 1703), Esther (Aquinas,

1622) . The Pentateuch was translated into German by L. Dukes (Prague, 1833-38, 8vo); Genesis w r as done by L. Haymann (Bonn, 1833, 8vo). Editions, especially of the Pentateuch, are very numer-ous. Only some of the chief can here be named,— (a) on the whole Bible, with the sacred text—Venice, 1545, 1595, 1607 (all three in 4to); Cracow, 1610, 4to; Basel, 1618, folio; ( b ) Pentateuch with text (all sm. folio) —Bologna, 1482; Ixar, 1490; Lisbon and Naples, 1491; (c) Pentateuch without text—Reggio, 1475, folio (the first Hebrew book printed with date); s. 1. ct a., but before 1480, 4to; Soncino, 1487, folio. MSS. of Rashi on the whole Bible are very rare, and even those which are supposed to be such turn out, on examination, to be either incomplete or defective, or both. There lies a precious MS. in Leyden (1 Seal.); but it is a trifle defective in Exodus. St John’s College, Cambridge, possesses a still more ancient and precious MS. (A. 3; dated 1239); but it lacks the Penta-teuch and Ezra(-Nehemiah), and is defective in the end (though, it is true, only in Chronicles, which is not Rashi’s, as mentioned before). But MSS. of Rashi on the Pentateuch, both old and good, abound. There are few libraries in Europe that have not one or two of this commentary. It is to be hoped, therefore, that Dr A. Berliner, who has already edited critically Rashi on the Pentateuch (Berlin, 1866, 8vo), although not on the faith of a sufficient number of MSS., will soon issue a second and superior edition.

B. Commentary on the Babylonian Talmud, ^[18. On this word see Schiller-Szinessy, Catalogue, i. p. 181, note. ] .קונטרס—Rashi had not been dead a hundred years when it was felt in the learned world that no such master in the Talmud had ever existed before him, and that without his aid and especially his corrections of the text (then only embodied in his commentary), the sea of the Baby-Ionian Talmud could not safely be sailed on. He became now the teacher even of the Jews in the East. He commented on the whole of the Talmud to which Gemara is attached (see Mishnah), except on Nedarim from leaf 22b to the end, Nazir and Tamid from begin-ning to end, Baba Bathra from 29a to the end, and Makkoth from leaf 19b ^[19. His disciple, son-in-law, and continuator Rabbenu Yehudah b. Nathan writes: “At the word ‘ tahor ’ (pure) the soul of our teacher went out in purity.” ] to the end. In commenting on the two last-named massekhtoth death surprised him. Rashi on the Talmud has never been printed apart from the text, and so the first complete edition is that contained in the editio princeps of the Babylonian Talmud (Venice, 1520-23, folio). Portions had come out before with parts of the Talmud (Soncino, 1483, and elsewhere later). There are MSS. containing Rashi on isolated Talmudic treatises in various libraries: the Cambridge University Library and British Museum have six each, the Bodleian twelve, the Paris National Library seven.

C. The Religious Decisions (פסקים) given by Rashi are to be found in various works, principally in the so-called Siddur (i. and ii.) and Happardes (Warsaw, 1870, folio)—called Happardes Haggadol to distinguish it from the abridgment by R. Shemuel of Bamberg (13th century) called Likjcute Happardes (Venice, 1519, 4to) — a work of which Rashi himself seems to have laid the foundation, though other literature on other subjects is now mixed up with it. Of the same nature are אסור והתר (kindly lent to the writer by Dr Merzbacher of Munich) and Hoorah (only in part printed). Various halakhoth, &c., are also to be found in various mahzorim ( e.g., the Cambridge MS. Add. 667, leaves 153-156, and elsewhere), the Shibbole Halleket, ii. (by R. Sidkiyyaliu b. Abraham Harophe, Cambridge MS. Add. 653).

D. Poems (פיוטים).—Rashi was no poet by profession and much less by genius; but he had a tenderly feeling heart, and saw the horrors of the first crusade; and he wrote Selihoth (propitiatory and penitential prayers), which are by no means without their value. One is embodied in the additional service of the day of atonement and begins “Tannoth Saroth ” (Reshal’s Responsa, § xxix.), and several more, which form the acrostic Shelomoh bar Yishak, are found in the collection of the Selihoth of the Ash-kenazic rite. It is not improbable also that the Aramaic Reshuth iv. to the Haphtarah in Targum (introduction to the prophetic portion as given in Yonathan b. 'Uzz'iel’s Aramaic paraphrase), which is to be found in the Reuchlinian Codex (De Lagarde, Prophetae chaldaice, Leipsic, 1872, 8vo, leaf 492), is his. It is much his style, and the acrostic is Shelomoh (and not שמעק). It is also very probable that Reshuth v. is his. If so, he must have composed it when very young, as several expressions in it testify.

E. Le'azim (לעזים).—In his commentaries Rashi, like R. Gersliom before him and others after him, often introduces French words (chiefly verbs and nouns) to give precision to his explanations. Of these Le'azim there are certainly more than 3000, and they are most valuable to the student of old French. Unfortunately copyists, notably in Italy, and printers subsequently, have often substituted their own vernacular for the original French; there are now even Russian words to be found in Rashi. Four hundred years ago explanations of some of these Le'azim and of those of Kimhi were offered by the author of Makre Dardeke (Naples, 1488). Other contributions have followed intermittingly down to the present time (Brothers Bondi in Or Esther, Dessau, 1812; Dormitzer and Landau in Marpe Lashon, Odessa, 1865, 12mo). The labours of M. Arsene Darmsteter promise to be exhaustive, and are based on ex-tensive collations, see Romania, April 1872, p. 146 sq.

There is no satisfactory life of Rashi; most recent accounts rest on a Life by Zunz (1S22), which has not been reprinted in his collected works. (S. M. S.-S.)
