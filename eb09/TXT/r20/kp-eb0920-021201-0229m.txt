RADHANPUR a petty state of India, within the group of states under the supervision of the political superintendent of Palanpur; it is situated in the north-western corner of Gujarat, close to the Runn of Cutch, Bombay presidency, and lies between 23° 26' and 23° 58' N. lat. and between 71° 28' and 72° 3' E. long. The country is an open plain without hills and with few trees, square in shape, and about 35 miles across. Including the pergunnahs of Munjpur and Sami, it contains an area of 1150 square miles with a population (1881) of 98,129 (males 50,903, females 47,226), the majority being Hindus. Though subject to very great extremes of heat and cold, the climate is healthy. The estimated yearly revenue of the state is from £50,000 to £60,000. Its chief products are cotton, wheat, and all the common varieties of grain; the only manufacture of any importance is the preparation of a fine description of saltpetre. Radhanpur came under British protection in 1819, when the nawab applied for aid to check the raids of marauders. No tribute is exacted and its domestic relations are left entirely free.

Radhanpur, chief town of the state and the seat of the nawab, had a population of 14,722 in 1881. The nearest railway station is at Kharagoda, 40 miles distant.
