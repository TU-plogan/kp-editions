SANDUSKY, a city of the United States, the capital of Erie county, Ohio, lies at the mouth of Sandusky river, 210 miles by rail north-east of Cincinnati, and is handsomely built of limestone from the subjacent strata on ground rising gradually from the shore of Lake Erie. The court-house and the high school are both of considerable architectural note. Besides being the centre of a great vine-growing district, Sandusky has the largest freshwater fish market in the United States, is the seat of the State fish-hatchery (which annually puts about 3,000,000 young whitefish into the lake), and has attained a reputation for the manufacture of such wooden articles as handles, spokes, “bent work” for carriages, carpenters’ tools, &c. The city is coextensive with Portland township. Its population was 13,000 in 1870 and 15,838 in 1880.
