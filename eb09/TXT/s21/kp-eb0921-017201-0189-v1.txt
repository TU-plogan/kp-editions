ST IVES, a seaport and borough of west Cornwall, England, is situated at the west entrance of the beautiful St Ives Bay on the Bristol Channel, 7 miles north of Penzance. The older streets are narrow and irregular, but on the slopes above there are modern terraces with good houses. The town takes its name from St Hya or Ia, an Irish virgin who is said to have arrived in the bay in the 5th century. The parish church of St Andrew is in the Early Perpendicular style of the 15th century. In the churchyard is an ancient cross recently restored. A town-hall was erected in 1832. The town is the headquarters of the pilchard fishery. The port has suffered greatly from the accumulation of sand. A stone pier was built by Smeaton in 1767; a breakwater was commenced in 1816 but abandoned; and a wooden pier, which was commenced in 1865, is still unfinished. Formerly the town was called Pendenis or Pendunes. Its charter of incorporation, granted by Charles I. in 1639, was forfeited in 1685, but was renewed by James II. in 1686. From the reign of John until 1832 it sent two members to parliament, and one from 1832 until 1885, when it was merged in the St Ives division of the county. The population of the municipal borough (area, 1890 acres) in 1871 was 6965, and in 1881 it was 6445.
