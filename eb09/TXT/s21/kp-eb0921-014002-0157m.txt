SACRO BOSCO, Johannes he, or John Holywood, astronomical author, died 1244 (or 1256) as professor of mathematics at the university of Paris. Nothing else is known about his life. He wrote a treatise on spherical astronomy, Tractatus de Sphera Mundi, first printed at Ferrara in 1472, and reprinted, generally with copious notes and commentaries, about sixty times until the end of the 17th century. About the year 1232 he wrote De anni ratione sen ut vocatur vulgo computus ecclesiasticus, in which he points out the increasing error of the Julian calendar, and suggests a remedy which is nearly the same as that actually used under Gregory XIII. three hundred and fifty years later.
