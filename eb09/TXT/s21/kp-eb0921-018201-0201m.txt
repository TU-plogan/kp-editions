ST LEONARDS is the name given to the western and more modern part of Hastings (q.v. ), a watering-place on the coast of Sussex, England. St Leonards proper, which formed only a small part of the district now included under that name, was at one time a separate township. The population of St Leonards in 1881 was 7165.
