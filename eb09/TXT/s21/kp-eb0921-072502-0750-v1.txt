SEYCHELLES, an archipelago of the Indian Ocean, consisting of eighty islands—several of them mere islets— situated between 3° 38' and 5° 45' S. lat. and 52° 55' and 53° 50' E. long., about 1400 miles south-east of Aden and 1000 miles east of Zanzibar. They are the only small tropical oceanic islands of granitic structure, and rise steeply out of the sea, culminating in the island of Mahé, at an elevation of 2998 feet above the sea-level. The most northerly island is Bird, 1/2 by 1/4 mile; the most southerly, Plate; the most easterly, Frégates; the most westerly, Silhouette. Mahé, the largest island of the group, 3 by 1 1/2 miles, is very nearly central, 60 miles south of Bird, and having to the north and north-east of it La Digne, Félicité, Praslin, and Curieuse. Only a few— Mahé, Praslin, La Digne, Denis, and Bird—are inhabited. The total area is about 50,120 acres, of which Mahé alone comprises 34,749. The beaches of glistening calcareous sand are begirt by coral reefs which form a wall round the islands. The valleys and easier slopes are overlaid with a very fertile soil, and vegetation is most luxuriant. Though the climate is tropical, the heat is tempered and rendered uniform by the sea breezes, and probably this accounts for epidemic diseases and endemic fever being of uncommon[9:21:726] occurrence. There are numerous brooks and torrents, making their way to the sea between blocks of granite. The islands are green and fresh at all times, particularly during the wet season from November to May. The total rainfall for 1881 was 113.50 inches. The extreme range of the thermometer in 1881 and 1882 was only 22° (minimum 71°, maximum 93°). The heat is seldom sultry and oppressive. The Seychelles lie too far to the north to receive the hurricanes which occasionally sweep over Bourbon and Mauritius, and even thunderstorms are rare. The population at the census of 1881 was 14,081 (7179 males and 6902 females)—500 white (mostly French creoles), 11,500 black, and 2000 coolies. Since 1881 the population has considerably increased in consequence of a tide of immigration from Mauritius. Men and women of exceptionally great age are frequently met with, and the death-rate for 1880 amounted to only 13·1 per 1000. The prevailing language is a French patois, but English is taught in the schools.

These islands were discovered at the beginning of the 16th century, but never occupied, by the Portuguese. In 1742 the French took possession of them, calling them at first Îles des Labourdonnais, but afterwards the Seychelles, from Count Hérault de Seychelles, an officer of the East Indian fleet. The first settlement was made in 1768 at Mahé, now Port Victoria. In 1794 the English wrested them from the French along with Mauritius, and they are now ruled by a board of six civil commissioners, as a dependency under the governor of Mauritius. In 1834 slavery was abolished, and since then the plantations have been in a declining state. In 1884 there were in the islands 20 primary schools aided by Government grants and attended by 1620 children. There are 16 churches belonging to the Roman Catholics (the dominant faith) and 11 to the Church of England. The main product is the cocoa-nut, but tobacco, coffee, rice, maize, sweet potatoes, and manioc are raised for homo consumption, while cotton, pepper, cinnamon, and other spices grow wild. Many of the trees display simultaneously blossoms and unripe and ripe fruit. The so-called sea or Maldive double cocoa-nut, “coco de mer,” the fruit of the palm-tree Lodoicea Sechellarum, is peculiar to certain of these islands. It was long known only from sea-borne specimens cast up on the Maidive and other coasts, was thought to grow on a submarine palm, and, being esteemed a sovereign antidote to poisons (Lusiad, x. 136), commanded exorbitant prices in the East. This palm will grow to a height of 100 feet, and shows fern-like leaves of enormous size. Sensitive plants from America spread like lawns over the soil and quake at every step taken over them. The cocoa-nut palm flourishes in the gardens, overtopping the houses and most other trees, lining the shore, climbing high up the mountains, and in many places forming extensive forests. There are no native mammals, and domestic animals are scarce. The birds comprise gannets, terns in great numbers, and white egrets. Tortoises are common,—among them the gigantic turtle and black turtle, whose flesh is exported. The sea abounds in fish, many of them distinguished by splendid colours, and yields the inhabitants not only a large part of their animal food but also material for building their houses,—a species of massive coral, Porites gaimardi, being hewn into square building blocks which at a distance glisten like white marble.

The principal harbour is Port Victoria, situated on Mahé island. The total value of imports here in 1884, including Rs. 27,097 specie, was Rs. 428,605, and of the exports, including Rs. 21,582 specie, Rs. 392,175. The chief imports were coffee and cotton manufactures; the chief exports, cocoa-nut, cocoa-nut oil, and sperm oil. The fiscal receipts for 1884 amounted to Rs.130,047. The cultivation of cocoa is progressing favourably, but the same cannot be said of the vanilla and clove plantations, which suffer from want of regular labour, attributable to the widespread share system, which the negroes prefer to regular work. The leaf disease affecting coffee has done great injury, and cocoa-nut plantations have suffered from the ravages of an insect, but no effort seems to have yet been made by weeding the plantations to stamp out the disease. Of the 34,749 acres of land making up Mahé, 12,000 acres are laid out in cocoa-nut, 500 in vanilla, coffee, and cloves, and 1500 are in forest; of the uncultivated land 8000 acres are well suited for vanilla, cocoa, and coffee plantations.
