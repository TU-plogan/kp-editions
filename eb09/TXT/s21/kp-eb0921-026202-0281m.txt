SANDYS, George (1577-1644), famous in the reigns of James I. and Charles I. as a traveller and a metrical translator. He was born in 1577, the youngest son of an archbishop of York, studied at St Mary Hall, Oxford, and afterwards probably at Corpus Christi, and began his travels in 1610. The record of them was a substantial contribution to geography and ethnology, written in a style always interesting and often eloquent, interspersed with versified scraps of quotations from classical authors. He travelled from Venice to Constantinople, thence to Egypt, thence by way of Mount Sinai to Palestine, and back to Venice by way of Cyprus, Sicily, Naples, and Rome. Later on in his life he published translations of Ovidâ€™s Metamorphoses, the first book of the AEneid, and various books of Scripture. His verse was praised by Dryden, and deservedly so, for it has vitality as well as a clearly marked rhythm. He died in 1644. Selections from his poetry were published by the Rev. H. J. Todd in 1839.
