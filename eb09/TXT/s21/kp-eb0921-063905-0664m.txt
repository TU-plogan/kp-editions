SEMIRAMIS. According to the legend which the Greeks received from Ctesias, and which is most fully preserved by Diodorus (book ii.) in a form that, according to the researches of C. Jacoby (Rhein. Museum, 1875, p. 555 sq.), is not taken direct from Ctesias but comes through Clitarchus, and has been modified by traits borrowed from the history of Alexander the Great, the Assyrian empire over all Asia as far as the borders of India was created by[9:21:640] Ninus, the founder of Nineveh, and his greater spouse Semiramis, who was first the wife of his captain, Onnes, but won the king’s love by an heroic exploit, the capture of Bactra, which had defied the royal forces. Ninus died, and Semiramis, succeeding to his power, traversed all parts of the empire, erecting great cities (especially Babylon) and stupendous monuments or opening roads through savage mountains. She was unsuccessful only in an attack on India. At length, after a reign of forty-two years, she delivered up the kingdom to her son Ninyas and disappeared, or, according to what seems to be the original form of the story, was turned into a dove and was thenceforth worshipped as a deity. This legend is certainly not Assyrian or Babylonian; Ctesias must have had it from Persians or Medes, and the fulness of detail, the multitude of proper names, favour the conjecture that Ninus and Semiramis were celebrated in some Median epic tale which went on to tell of the fall of Assyria before the Medes (Duncker, Gesch. d. Alt., 5th ed., ii. 18 sq.). In this legend all the conquests of Assyria were crowded together into one lifetime, and King Ninus and his son Ninyas are mere eponyms of Nineveh, personifications of the Assyrian monarchy. But it is round the figure of Semiramis that all the real interest of the legend gathers; nor can she be the arbitrary creation of a poet, for it is certain that her name was popularly connected with many famous places and monuments. “The works of Semiramis,” says Strabo (xvi. 1, 2), “are pointed out through almost the whole continent, earthworks bearing her name, walls and strongholds, aqueducts, and stair-like roads over mountains, canals, roads, and bridges.” Ultimately every stupendous work of antiquity by the Euphrates or in Iran seems to have been ascribed to her,—even the Behistun inscriptions of Darius (Diod., ii. 13). Of this we already have evidence in Herodotus, who, though he does not know the legend afterwards told by Ctesias, ascribes to her the banks that confined the Euphrates (i. 184) and knows her name as borne by a gate of Babylon (iii. 155). Various places in Media bore the name of Semiramis, but slightly changed, even in the Middle Ages (Hoffmann, Syrische Akten, p. 137), and the old name of Van was Shamirama-gerd, Armenian tradition regarding her as its founder (St Martin, Mém. sur L'Arménie, i. 138). These facts are to be explained by observing that in her birth as well as in her disappearance from earth Semiramis clearly appears not as a mere woman but as a great goddess. In Diodorus’s account she is the daughter of the Derceto of Ascalon and miraculously brought up by doves, and again she is finally transformed into a dove, and therefore the Assyrians pay divine honours to this bird. Semiramis, therefore, is a dove-goddess associated with Derceto the fish-goddess. The same association of the fish and dove goddesses appears at Hierapolis (Bambyce, Mabbug), the great temple at which according to one legend was founded by Semiramis (De Dea Syria, 14), and where her statue was shown with a golden dove on her head (ibid., 33, comp. 39).^[1. It is noteworthy in this connexion that Mabbug is the Ninus vetus of Ammianus and Philostratus. . ] But the Semitic dove-goddess is Ishtar or Astarte, the great goddess of Assyria and Babylon, and the irresistible charms of Semiramis, her sexual excesses (see especially Dinon in Aelian, V. H., vii. 1 ), and other features of the legend all bear out the view that she is primarily a form of Astarte, and so fittingly conceived as the great queen of Assyria. The word Semirāmis in Semitic form, as the Syrians write it, is Shĕmirâm (Hoffmann, ut supra ) , an epithet rather than a proper name, which may be rendered “the highly celebrated,” or perhaps rather “name [manifestation] of [the god] Rām.”^[2. Cp. the Phoenician “Astarte ⅛l2Dt}D ’ (C.I.S. i. 1, No. 3, 1. 18). ] The historical inference from all this is that Semitic worship was carried by the Assyrians far into Media and Armenia.

On an Assyrian inscription the name Sammuramat appears as borne by the “lady of the palace” of Rammannivar (812-783 b.c.); see Schrader, K.A.T., 2d ed., p. 366. E. Meyer (Gesch. des Alterth., p. 409) combines this with the statement of Herodotus that Semiramis lived five generations before Nitocris, which would make her date 766 b.c. Possibly Herodotus identified the two names, but it is very doubtful whether they are really connected. Shemiramoth (1 Chron. xv. 18) perhaps means “statues of Semiramis,” and, if so, was originally a place-name (Ewald, a.l .).
