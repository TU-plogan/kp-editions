SEGOVIA, the capital of the above province, clusters upon a narrow ridge of rock which rises in the valley of the Eresma, where this river is joined by its turbulent little tributary the Clamores, and is one of the best specimens extant of the Gotho-Castilian cities. Founded originally as a Roman pleasure resort, it became in the Middle Ages a great royal and religious centre, and was surrounded by Alphonso VI. with the walls and towers which still give to it, even in their dilapidation, the air of a military stronghold. The streets are steep, irregular, and narrow, and are lined with quaint old-fashioned houses as irregular and forbidding, built for the most part of granite from the neighbouring sierra. The place teems with records and monuments of the many vicissitudes of fortune and art through which it has passed, foremost among the latter being the ancient Alcázar, the cathedral, the aqueduct of Trajan, and a notable array of churches and other ecclesiastical edifices. The Alcázar is perched upon the western tip of the long tongue of rock upon which the city is built, and which at this point has a sheer descent upon three sides into the valley. Of the original Middle-Age fortress but little remains save the noble façade,—the building having been wantonly fired in 1862 by the students of the artillery school then domiciled within its walls, and all but destroyed. It is now in course of slow but praiseworthy restoration. The work is Gotho-Moorish, with an admixture of Renaissance in the decoration. Some of the rooms deserve notice, especially the Sala del Trono and the Sala de Recibimiento. The views obtained over the outlying vega from the towers and windows are superb. The 16th-century cathedral (1521-1577), the work of Juan Gil de Ontañon and his son Rodrigo, occupies the site of a former church of the 11th century, of which the present cloisters, rebuilt in 1524, formed part. It is a well-proportioned and delicate piece of Late Gothic—the latest of its kind in Spain—317 feet long by 177 wide. The central nave rises 99 feet and the tower 330. The exterior is the least satisfactory portion, at once bald and over-decorated; the interior is light and pure, with an effectiveness greatly enhanced by some very fine stained glass. The churches of Segovia are legion, though many of them are closed and fast falling into disrepair. The most remarkable are those of La Vera Cruz (Knights Templar, Romanesque of the early 13th century), San Millan and San Juan (both Romanesque of second half of 13th century), El Parral (Gothic of early 16th century), and Corpus Christi, an ancient Jewish sanctuary and an interesting specimen of Moorish work. The towers and external cloistering, or corredores, of several of the later churches—especially those of San Estéban and San Martin—are fine. The great aqueduct, however, called El Puente del Diablo, ranks usually as the glory of Segovia, and is remarkable alike for its colossal proportions, its history, its picturesqueness, and the art with which it is put together. Erected first, according to fairly reliable tradition, in the time of the emperor Trajan, and several times barely escaping destruction, it is now, after nearly eighteen hundred years, in perfect working order, bringing the pure waters of the Rio Frio down from the Sierra Fonfria, distant 10 miles to the south. The bridge portion striding across the valley into the city is 847 yards long, and consists of a double tier of superimposed arches, built of rough-hewn granite blocks, laid without lime or cement. The three centre arches are 102 feet in height. Segovia finally lost its ancient prosperity when it was taken and sacked by the French in 1808. Some insignificant manufactories of cloth, leather, paper, and rude earthenware still exist in the suburb of San Lorenzo, but the trade of the place languishes year by year. The city is the see of a bishop, suffragan to Valladolid. The population in 1877 was 11,318.
