SAN CRISTOBAL DE LOS LLANOS, otherwise known as Ciudad Real, chief town of the Mexican state of Chiapas, stands in a fertile valley on the eastern slope of the central mountain range 450 miles east-south-east from the city of Mexico. It was founded in 1528 under the name of Villa Real, and received its present name in 1829. Its inhabitants, variously estimated as numbering from 8000 to 12,000, are chiefly employed in rearing cattle. Coarse woollen and cotton stuffs, and also common earthenware, are manufactured.
