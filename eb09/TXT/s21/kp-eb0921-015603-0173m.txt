SAINT-AMANT, Marc Antoine Gerard, Sieur de (1594-1661), the most eminent of a curious bacchanalian school of poets in France during the 17th century, was born at Rouen in the year 1594. Very little is known of his family except that it was of some position at Rouen, and the mysterious description which all his French biographers give of his father—that he was a sailor “qui commanda pendant 22 ans un escadre de la reine Éliza-beth”—does not greatly assist an English imagination. It appears that Saint-Amant himself haunted taverns and[9:21:157] other resorts of gay society a good deal during his youth and manhood, that he attached himself at different times to different great noblemen—Retz (the duke, not the cardinal), Créqui, Harcourt, &c.—that he saw some military service, and sojourned at different times in Italy, in England (a sojourn which provoked from him a violent poetical attack on the country, only printed within the last thirty years), in Poland (where he held a court appointment for two years), and elsewhere. But details on all these points are both few and vague. Saint-Amant’s later years were spent in France; and he died at Paris in 1661.

Saint-Amant has left a not inconsiderable body of poetry as various in style as Herrick’s, and exhibiting a decided poetical faculty, hardly at all assisted by education. Of one class of his poetry the chief monument is the Moïse Sauvé, published in 1653. The author calls this by the odd title of “idylle héroïque”; but it is to all intents and purposes an epic of the school of Tasso. It is not by any means without merit, and the alexandrine couplet is managed in it with much vigour and ease. The second and larger part of Saint-Amant’s works consists of short miscellaneous poems on a great variety of subjects. The best of these are Bacchanalian, the oft-quoted La Débauche being one of the most remarkable convivial poems of its kind. All through his work flashes of strength and true poetical imagination occur; but he was rarely happy in his choice of subjects, and his execution is constantly marred by want of polish and form.

The standard edition of Saint-Amant, with life, notes, &c., is that in the “Bibliothèque Elzévirienne” by M. C. L. Livet (2 vols., Paris, 1855).
