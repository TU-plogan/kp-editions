SCHWARZENBERG, Karl Philipp, Prince of (1771-

1820), Austrian field-marshal, was born on 15th April 1771 at Vienna. He fought in 1789 under Lacy with distinction against the Turks and became major in 1792. In the French campaign of 1793 he held command of a portion of the advanced guard under the duke of Coburg, and in 1794 his impetuous charge at the head of a cavalry regiment greatly contributed to the victory of Cateau-Cambrésis. After the battle of Würzburg in September 1796 he was raised to the rank of major-general, and in 1799 to that of field-marshal in command of a division. At the defeat of Hohenlinden in 1800 his promptitude and courage saved those under his command from being surrounded and taken prisoners. In the war of 1805 he held command of a division under General Mack, and when Ulm capitulated to Napoleon in October he cut his way through the hostile lines with some cavalry regiments. At the special request of the emperor Alexander he undertook an embassy to St Petersburg in 1808, but two days before the battle of Wagram he arrived in the camp and assumed command as general of the cavalry. After the peace of Vienna he was sent to Paris to negotiate a marriage between Napoleon and the duchess Maria Louisa. From this time he secured Napoleon’s special confidence and esteem, and at his request took command of the Austrian auxiliary corps in the Russian campaign. In August he received the command of the seventh or Saxon army corps; after gaining some slight advantages over the Russians, he was compelled to retreat before superior forces to the duchy of Warsaw, where, according to instructions from Napoleon, he remained for some months inactive at Pultusk. In 1813 he was appointed commander-in-chief of the allied forces, and, after defeating·Napoleon at Leipsic in October, carried the campaign to a successful issue by entering Paris in March 1814. On the conclusion of the war he became president of the Aulic Council. He died from paralysis at Leipsic on 15th October 1820.
