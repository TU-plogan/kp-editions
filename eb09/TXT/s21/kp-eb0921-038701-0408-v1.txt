SCHAFFHAUSEN, the capital of the above canton, is situated on the bank of the Rhine, 30 ½ miles by rail west of Constance and 60 east of Basel, and communicates by a bridge with the village of Feuerthalen (1000 inhabitants) in Zurich. It is a city of contrasts—mediaeval architecture of the true Swabian type and modern manufactures mingling curiously together. The cathedral, formerly the church of the abbey of All Saints (Allerheiligen), is a massive basilica founded in 1104 and completed in 1453; its great bell (1486) bears the inscription Vivos voco, mortuos plango, fulgura frango, which suggested Schiller’s “Song of the Bell” and the opening of Longfellow’s Golden Legend. On the Rebhügel above the town rises the castle of Munoth (1564-1590) with bomb-proof casemates, and a tower whose top is reached by a spiral ascent up which one can ride or drive. In Herrenacker Platz stands the Imthurneum, a building erected (1864) and presented to the town by a Swiss citizen, resident in London, for the “promotion of aesthetic and scientific culture”; it contains a theatre, concert-rooms, &c. The public library (28,000 volumes) possesses the printed and MS. collections of Johann von Müller, who was born at Schaffhausen in 1752, and his monument adorns the promenade of the Vesenstaub. In the museum is preserved the famous Keszlerloch “find.” Among the industrial establishments of the city and vicinity are ironworks, waggon and carriage factories, woollen and cotton factories, breweries, distilleries, and champagne factories. The population of the commune was 10,303 in 1870 and 11,795 in 1880.

Schaffhausen (Latinized as Scafusia or Graecized into Probatopolis) first appears in the 9th century, and had already attained the rank of an imperial city in 1264.
