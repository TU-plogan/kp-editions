SEPTEMBER, the seventh month of the old Roman year, had thirty days assigned to it. By the Julian arrangement, while retaining its former name and number of days, it became the ninth month. The Ludi Magni (Ludi Romani) in honour of Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva began on the 4th of September. The principal ecclesiastical feasts falling within the month are—the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin on the 8th, the Exaltation of the Holy Cross on the 14th, St Matthew the Apostle on the 21st, and St Michael the Archangel on the 29th. September was called “harvest month” in Charlemagne’s calendar, and it corresponds partly to the Fructidor and partly to the Vendémiaire of the first French republic.
