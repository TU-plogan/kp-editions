ST JOHN, capital of St John county and the largest city of the province of New Brunswick, is strikingly situated at the mouth of the river of the same name, in 45 14 6 ' N. lat. and 66° 3' 30" W. long (see vol. xvii., plate IV.). It stands on an elevated rocky peninsula which projects into the harbour for a considerable distance. The latter, which is protected by batteries and never freezes, is well equipped with wharves and docks, and is capable of accommodating ships of the largest size. Its. entrance is guarded by Partridge Island, lying 2 miles south of the city, and containing the quarantine hospital and lighthouse. About 1¼ miles north of the lighthouse is situated the Beacon, and below the town east of the channel is the breakwater, 2250 feet long. The St John river enters the harbour through a rocky and sharply defined gorge, 100 yards wide and about 400 long, having a total fall of about 17 feet, which is passable to ships for forty-five minutes during each ebb and flow of the tide. The river has alternately an inward and an outward fall twice every twenty-four hours, the high-water tide level immediately below the gorge being 6 to 8 feet higher than the average level above the gorge. The river is here spanned by a stanch suspension bridge 640 feet long and 100 feet above low-water level, and a cantilever railway bridge, 2260 feet long, with a river span of 825 feet, was opened in 1885. The city, approached from the sea, presents a bold and picturesque appearance, and, next to Quebec, possesses more natural beauty than any other town in Canada. There are three large public squares, and the streets (lighted with gas and the electric light) are regularly laid out. The water supply is derived from Little river, 5 miles distant, and brought to the city by three separate mains with an aggregate capacity estimated at 10,000,000 gallons daily; the present daily consumption (including that of the city of Portland) is 5,000,000 gallons. The works, which are owned by the city, cost $992,326. The water supply of St John (West) is derived from Spruce Lake. St John (East) has also an admirable sewerage system.

On the 20th of June 1877 two-fifths of St John (about 200 acres) were destroyed by a fire, which in nine hours burned over $27,000,000 worth of property. The city was quickly rebuilt, and on a much grander scale, many brick and stone edifices taking the place of the old landmarks, which were principally composed of wood. The chief buildings are—the Roman Catholic cathedral, Trinity, St Andrew’s, the Stone, St David’s, the Centenary, Germain Street Baptist, and Leinster Street Baptist churches, the custom-house, post-office, city-hall, savings bank, Wiggins’s Orphan Asylum, Victoria skating-rink, lunatic asylum, Victoria and Madras schools, the Masonic and Oddfellows’ halls, the young men’s Christian association building, the general public, the epidemic, and the marine hospitals, the court-house, jail, police office, and mechanics’ institute (with a reading-room, library, and museum). There are thirty-three places of worship (Church of England 6, Roman Catholic 3, Presbyterian 7, Wesleyan Methodist 5, Baptist 6, Congregationalist 1, Methodist Episcopal 1, Christian Brethren 1, Disciples of Christ 2, and Christadelphians 1); the educational institutions consist of a grammar-school, a Madras school, Baptist seminary, and[9:21:173] several public and private schools and academies. St John has also a free public library, numerous religious, charitable, scientific, and literary societies, and three daily newspapers. Carleton, on the opposite side of the river, and connected with the east side by ferry, is included within the corporation limits, and is represented in the common council. The population in 1871 was 28,805, in 1881 it was 26,127 (males 12,263, females 13,864), the decrease being caused by the great fire of 1877, when many persons left the city.

St John is the entrepot of a large extent of country, rich in minerals, agricultural produce, and timber. It is the seat of an extensive business connexion, and possesses first-class means of communication both by steamships and sailing vessels and by railways. Οf late years its maritime and manufacturing interests have been greatly extended. The chief articles of manufacture are iron-castings, steam engines and locomotives, railway cars, coaches and carriages, machinery, edge-tools, nails and tacks, cotton and woollen goods, furniture, wooden ware, leather, boots and shoes, soap and candles, agricultural implements, lumber, sugar-boxes, paper, boats, sails, &c. The fisheries afford employment to about 1000 men, and shad, salmon, holibut, cod, herrings, alewives, sturgeons, and haddock comprise the chief varieties taken. The exports ($4,310,576 in 1884) consist of fish, lumber, woollen and cotton goods, manufactured articles, &c.; the imports ($4,621,691 in 1884) are tobaccos, sugar and molasses, spirits and malt liquors, dried fruits, coffee, tea, silks, velvets, &c. The following figures represent the movement of the coasting trade in 1884 :—vessels arrived 1864, tonnage 117,566, men 7340; vessels departed 1941, tonnage 105,050, men 6875. The number of entrances from foreign ports was 1904 (486,471 tons), of clearances 1961 (517,415 tons). The vessels on the registry books (31st December 1884) numbered 677, with a tonnage of 251,136; 53 vessels were built in that year with a tonnage of 18,989. The taxable property in 1885 was—real estate $9,122,000, personal $9,153,300, income $2,833,900, total $21,109,200. The corporation affairs are managed by a mayor, elected by the people annually, and a city council of eighteen members. St John city and county return three members to the House of Commons of Canada, and six members to the House of Assembly of New Brunswick. The climate, though healthy, is changeable, the pleasantest season being the autumn. The highest temperature observed since 1860 was 87° Fahr., and the lowest-22° Fahr., the mean temperature for spring, summer, autumn, and winter respectively being 36°·9, 58°, 45°, and 20°·6. The number of schools is 81, with 4171 pupils (average daily attendance 2722). Besides the libraries belonging to the city and the mechanics’ institute, there are large collections of books open to members of the young men’s Christian association and the Church of England institute. Navigation on St John river opens on 15th April and closes on 26th November.

De Monts visited St John in 1604, but it was not until 1635 that a regular settlement of the place was made, when Charles de la Tour founded a colony, which existed under French rule, with varying fortunes, until 1758, when it finally passed under British control. In 1764 the first Scottish settlers arrived in New Brunswick, and in 1783 the Loyalists landed at St John and established the city. It was called Parr Town, in honour of Governor Parr, until 1785, when it was incorporated with Conway (Carleton) under royal charter, as the city of St John.
