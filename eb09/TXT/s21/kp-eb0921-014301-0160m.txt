SADLER, Sir Ralph (1507-1587), English statesman, was the son of Henry Sadler, steward to the proprietor of the manor of Gillney, near Great Hadham, Hertfordshire, and was born at Hackney in Middlesex in 1507. While a mere child he obtained a situation in the family of Thomas Cromwell, earl of Essex. Through him he was introduced to Henry VIII., who conferred on him various appointments and employed him in connexion with the dissolution of the monasteries, in the rich spoils of which he was a large sharer. So much was the king impressed by Sadler’s ability and address that he made choice of him for his subsequent important negotiations with Scotland. In 1537 he was sent thither to strengthen the English interest; in 1539-40 he was commissioned to persuade the Scottish king James V. to cast off the supremacy of the pope; in 1541 he went back to enforce the same counsel; and in 1542 he was appointed to settle the proposed match between Edward prince of Wales and Mary the infant queen of Scots. Although not successful in any of these missions, he continued to retain the full confidence of the king, who, in recognition of his zealous services, conferred on him in 1543 the honour of knighthood. On Henry’s death in 1547 Sadler’s name was found in the royal will as one of the councillors to the sixteen nobles who were entrusted with the guardianship of the young king. In the same year he was appointed treasurer to the army sent against Scotland, and for his great services in rallying the repulsed cavalry he was created a knight-banneret on the battlefield of Pinkie. During the reign of Mary he lived in retirement on his estate near Hackney; but on the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 he came once more into a sphere of active employment. He immediately became a member of parliament for the county of Hertford and a privy councillor.[9:21:144] Not long afterwards his strong Protestant sympathies and his acquaintance with Scottish affairs recommended him as a fit person to be employed by Elizabeth in her intrigues with the Scottish lords of the congregation against Queen Mary. In 1584 he was appointed keeper of Mary queen of Scots in the castle of Tutbury; but on account of “age and infirmity” he was permitted to resign his charge some time before the death of the queen. His last service was to repair to Scotland to pacify the king’s indignation on account of Mary’s death. He died after his return home at Standon in Hertfordshire, 30th March 1587.

The Letters and Negotiations of Sir Ralph Sadler were published at Edinburgh in 1720, and a more complete collection under the title State Papers and, Letters of Sir Ralph Sadler, with a life by Sir Walter Scott, in 1809. The Memoir of the Life and Times of Sir Ralph Sadleir, by his Descendant Major F. Sadleir Stoney, appeared in 1877.
