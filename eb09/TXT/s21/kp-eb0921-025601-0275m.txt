SANDARACH is a resinous body obtained from the small Coniferous tree Callitris quadrivalvis, native of the north-west regions of Africa, and especially characteristic of the Atlas Mountains. The resin, which is procured as a natural exudation on the stems, and also obtained by making incisions in the bark of the trees, comes into commerce in the form of small round balls or elongated tears, transparent, and having a delicate yellow tinge. It is a little harder than mastic, for which it is sometimes substituted, and does not soften in the mouth like that resin; but, being very brittle, it breaks with a clean glassy fracture. Sandarach has a faintly bitter resinous taste, and a pleasant balsamic odour. It consists of a mixture of three distinct resins, the first readily soluble in alcohol, constituting 67 per cent. of the mass, while the second dissolves with more difficulty, and the third is soluble only in hot alcohol. Sandarach is imported chiefly from Mogador, and is an important ingredient in spirit varnishes. It is also used as incense, and by the Arabs medicinally as a remedy for diarrhoea. An analogous resin is procured in China from Callitris sinensis, and in South Australia, under the name of pine gum, from C. Reissii.
