SHWE-GYENG, a district of British Burmah, in the Tenasserim division, containing an area of 5567 square miles, and lying in the valley of the Tsit-toung (Sitoung) river. It is bounded on the N. by Toung-gnú district, on the E. by the Poung-loung Hills and the Salwín Hill Tracts, on the S. by Amherst district, and on the W. by the Pegu Yoma Hills. The boundaries have more than once been altered, the last change having taken place in 1877. The aspect of the country is mountainous, especially in the north. The Tsit-toung is navigable throughout its entire length in the district by large boats and steam-launches. Shwe-gyeng has never been accurately surveyed from a geological point of view, but it is supposed to be rich in minerals. Gold is found in most of the affluents of the river Shwe-gyeng; copper, lead, tin, and coal also exist, but are not worked. Except in the hills, the climate is generally healthy; the average annual rainfall at Shwe-gyeng station is 144 inches.

In 1881 the population of the district was 171,144 (89,687 males and 81,457 females), of whom Hindus numbered 958, Mohammedans 855, Buddhists 158,149, and Christians 1250. The only town with more than 5000 inhabitants is Shwe-gyeng, the capital and headquarters of the district, which was founded during the 18th century, before the Burmese conquest, by Alompra. It is situated at the junction of the Shwe-gyeng with the Tsit-toung, and had a population of 7519 in 1881. Only 187 square miles of the district were cultivated in 1883-84; the cultivated area is, however, gradually[9:21:850] extending, and there are some 3474 square miles capable of cultivation. The principal crop is rice, of which twenty-five different kinds are grown; other products are cotton, betel-nuts, tobacco, and sugar-cane. The only industries are potteries, salt-making, and silk-spinning. In 1883-84 the total revenue amounted to £36,476, of which the land-tax contributed £15,967.
