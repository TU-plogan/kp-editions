SHOVEL, Sir Cloudesley (c. 1650-1707), English admiral, was according to some accounts a native of Yorkshire, but the most commonly accepted statement is that he was born of poor parents about 1650 in Clay, a fishing-village of Norfolk, where he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Having run away to sea, he became cabin-boy on board a ship commanded by Sir Christopher Mynns. He set himself to study navigation, and, owing to his able seamanship and brave and open-hearted disposition, became a general favourite and obtained quick promotion. In 1674 he served as lieutenant under Sir John Narborough in the Mediterranean, where he burned four men-of-war under the castles and walls of Tripoli, belonging to the pirates of that place. He was present as captain of the “Edgar” at the first fight at Bantry Bay, and shortly afterwards was knighted. In 1690 he convoyed William III. across St George’s Channel to Ireland; the same year he was made rear-admiral of the blue, and was present at the battle of Beachy Head on 10th July. In 1692 he was appointed rear-admiral of the red, and joined Admiral Russell, under whom he greatly distinguished himself at La Hogue, having a principal share in burning twenty of the enemy’s men-of-war. Not long after, when Admiral Russell was dismissed from the service, Shovel was put in joint command of the fleet with Admiral Killigrew and Sir Ralph Delaval. In 1702 he was sent to bring home the spoils of the French and Spanish fleets from Vigo, after their capture by Sir George Rooke, and in 1704 he served under Sir George Rooke in the Mediterranean. In January 1705 he was named rear-admiral of England, and shortly afterwards commander-in-chief of the British fleets. He co-operated in the capture of Barcelona along with the earl of Peterborough in 1705, and made an unsuccessful attempt on Toulon in October 1707. When returning with the fleet to England his ship, the “Association,” at eight o’clock at night on the 22d October, struck on the rocks near Scilly, and was seen by those on board the “St George” to go down in three or four minutes’ time, not a soul being saved of 800 men that were on board. The body of Sir Cloudesley Shovel was cast ashore next day, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.
