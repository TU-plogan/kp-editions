SAN MARINO, the smallest independent republic in Europe, has an area of 33 square miles (Strelbitsky), lies between the provinces of Forlì and Pesaro-Urbino, and consists of part of the eastern spurs of the Apennines. Monte Titano, the central and culminating summit, has three peaks (M. Guaita, Cucco, and Gista), the three Penne of San Marino—a name evidently identical with the Celtic Penn or Benn, but translated by the canting heraldry of the republic’s coat of arms as three “feathers.” The two[9:21:267] streams (Marecchia and Ausa) which pass through Rimini to the sea have their head-waters partly in the north and west of San Marino, while its south-eastern valleys are drained by the sources of the Marano. Farming and stock-raising occupy the bulk of the population (total, 5700 in 1850, 7816 in 1874), and their wines and oxen are both highly prized. The city of San Marino (1600 inhabitants), formerly reached only by a mule-track but since 1875 by a good carriage-road, is a quaint little place with steep and narrow streets and picturesque but gloomy houses of undressed stone, and containing five churches, a council-hall, an audience chamber, a law court, a little theatre, a museum, and a library. In the centre of the principal square (Pianello) stands a white marble statue of Liberty, presented by the duchess of Acquaviva. At the foot of the city-hill lies the Borgo di San Marino (the commercial centre of the republic); and other municipal villages are Serravalle, Faetano, and Montegiardino, each with remains of its castle and fortifications.

The republic is governed by a great council (Generale-Consiglio-Principe) of 60 members (20 nobles, 20 burgesses, 20 rural landowners) named for life by the council itself. From this body is elected the Council of Twelve, which with the assistance of a legal adviser decides in the third and last resort. Two captains-regent elected every six months (one from the nobles, one from the other two classes) represent the state, which also has its home secretary, its minister of foreign affairs, its chancellor of the exchequer, an army of 950 men, and a regular budget. By treaty with Italy (1872) San Marino, instead of maintaining a customs line of its own, receives a certain proportion of the Italian customs revenue, and, agreeing not to grow tobacco, is allowed to purchase foreign tobacco duty free. To avoid any difficulty about copyright there is no printing press in the republic.

San Marino derives its name from a certain Dalmatian mason who, along with a comrade immortalized by the neighbouring castle and cathedral of San Leo, settled in this region in the 3d century. The bones of Marinus are said to have been removed to Pavia by the Lombard king Astolphus and restored to the little city on Mount Titanus by Pippin; but the first authentic document proving the existence of the community dates from 885. Situated as a bulwark between the hostile houses of Montefeltro and Malatesta, San Marino fortunately attached itself to the stronger party, which in the 15th century placed its representative on the ducal throne of Urbino. The assistance which it rendered Duke Federigo and his allies, the king of Naples and the pope, against Sigismondo Malatesta was rewarded in 1463 with the castles and territories of Serravalle, Faetano, and Montegiardino. On the annexation of Urbino to the States of the Church (1631), the independence of San Marino was acknowledged; and the unauthorized assertion of papal jurisdiction by Alberoni in 1739 was disallowed by Clement XII. on February 5th 1740. In 1797 Napoleon I. decided to preserve this “échantillon de république;” and in 1854 it was protected from the designs of Pius IX. by the interference of Napoleon III. At the unification of Italy, Cibrario, a citizen in the service of the house of Savoy, helped to secure excellent terms for San Marino.
