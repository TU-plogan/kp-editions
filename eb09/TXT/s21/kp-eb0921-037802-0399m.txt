SCAUP, —the wild-fowler’s ordinary abridgment of Scaup-Duck, meaning a Duck so called “because she feeds upon Scaup, i.e., broken shelfish,” as may be seen in Willughby’s Ornithology (p. 365); but it would be more proper to say that the name comes from the “Mussel-scaups,” or “Mussel -scalps,^[1. "Scalp” primarily signifies a shell; cf. Old Dutch schelpe and Old Fr. escalope (Skeat, Etyrnol. Dictionary, p. 528). ]” the beds of rock or sand on which Mussels (Mytilus edulis, and other species) are aggregated,—the Anas marila of Linnaeus and Fuligula marila of modern systematic writers, a very abundant bird around the coasts of most parts of the northern hemisphere, repairing inland in spring for the purpose of reproduction, though so far as is positively known hardly but in northern districts, as Iceland, Lapland, Siberia, and the fur-countries of America. It was many years ago believed (Edin. N. Philos. Journal, xx. p. 293) to have been found breeding in Scotland, but assertions to that effect have not been wholly substantiated, though apparently corroborated by some later evidence (Proc . N. H. Soc. Glasgow, ii. p. 121, and Proc. Phys. Soc. Edinburgh, vii. p. 203). The Scaup-Duck has considerable likeness to the Pochard (vol. xix. p. 252), both in habits and appearance; but it much more generally affects salt-water, and the head of the male is black, glossed with green, and hence the name of “Blackhead,” by which it is commonly known in North America, where, however, a second species or race, smaller than the ordinary one, is also found, the Fuligula affinis. The female Scaup-Duck can be readily distinguished from the Dunbird or female Pochard by her broad white face. (a. n.)
