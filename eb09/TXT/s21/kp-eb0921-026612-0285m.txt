SAN LUIS POTOSI, a city of Mexico, capital of the state of the same name, is situated at a height of 6200 feet on the eastern edge of the great plain of Anahuac, in a valley running north and south, 160 miles north-west of Queretaro. It is a great centre for the “diligence” traffic, and in 1885 was connected by rail with Tampico, a promising harbour on the Gulf of Mexico. The city proper, which has a rather imposing Oriental appearance, is laid out with great regularity; the streets are well-paved, and the houses, usually two stories in height, are frequently fine specimens of old Spanish architecture. But suburbs of wretched hovels spread over a considerable area. Among the conspicuous buildings are the cathedral, the Government house, with a front in rose-coloured stone, the city-hall, the mint, the churches of El Carmen, San Francisco, &c., and the recently erected “American” hotel, which, with tramways, telephones, and electric light, is a symptom of the Occidentalizing that is rapidly taking place in the inland cities of Mexico. The Instituto Cientifico is a kind of university for the teaching of law, medicine, and the exact sciences. Plaza Hidalgo takes its name from the statue to the martyr of Mexican independence. A considerable trade is carried on in cattle, hides, and tallow. The population is stated at 30,000, or with the suburbs 60,000.

Founded in 1586, San Luis Potosi has played an important part in the Mexican civil wars. In 1863 it was the seat of the national government under Juarez, and after being occupied by Bazaine was recovered by Juarez in 1867.
