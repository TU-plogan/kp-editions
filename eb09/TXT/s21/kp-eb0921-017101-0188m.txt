ST HELEN’S, a market-town and municipal and parliamentary borough of south-west Lancashire, England, is situated on a branch of the London and North-Western Railway, 21 miles west by south of Manchester and 10 east-north-east of Liverpool. It is the principal seat in England for the manufacture of crown, plate, and sheet glass, and has extensive copper smelting and refining works, as well as chemical works, iron and brass foundries, and potteries. There are collieries in the neighbourhood. The town, which is entirely of modern origin, obtained a charter of incorporation in 1868. A town-hall was erected in 1873, and there are also a public library and various institutes for affording instruction and amusement to the working-class population. Extensive drainage works have been carried out under a local Act. The corporation are the owners of the waterworks and gasworks. Enfranchised in 1885, St Helen’s returns one member to the House of Commons. The population of the borough (area, 6586 acres) in 1871 was 45,134, and in 1881 it was 57,403.
