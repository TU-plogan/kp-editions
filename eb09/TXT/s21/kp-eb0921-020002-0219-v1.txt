ST THOMAS (Portuguese, São Thomé), a volcanic island in the Gulf of Guinea (West Africa), lies immediately north of the equator and in 6° 40' E. long. From the Gaboon, the nearest point of the mainland, the distance is 166 miles, and from the Cameroons 297. The extreme length of the island is 32 miles and the breadth from west to east 21; the area is estimated at 355 square miles. From the coast it rises pretty uniformly towards the lofty and verdant mountains, in the midst of which the peak of St Thomas towers to a height of 6000 feet. At least a hundred streams great and small rush down the mountainsides through deep-cut ravines, many of them forming beautiful waterfalls, such as those of Blu-blu, &c., on the Agua Grande. The bi-seasonal climate of the tropics obtains a comparatively normal development on the island, which, however, has a very evil repute of unhealthiness, probably owing to the fact that the chief town occupies a peculiarly malarial site on the coast. The first object of European cultivation in St Thomas was sugar, and to this the colony owed its prosperity in the 16th century; but now it is quite displaced by coffee and cocoa, introduced in the beginning of the 19th century. In 1879-80 the export of coffee was 3,778,580 ft) and of cocoa 1,026,746 ft). Vanilla and cinchona bark both succeed well, the latter between 1800 and 3300 feet of altitude. Though nearly the whole surface of the island is fitted for cultivation, only about a fifth part is really turned to account. Along with Principe, St Thomas forms a Portuguese province, to which are attached the little island of Rolas and the petty fort of Ajuda on the Guinea coast.

The town of St Thomas, the capital of the province, is situated on the north-east coast of the island, and the neighbouring districts form the only well-peopled region. In 1878 the population in the island was 18,266, of whom 1200 were white. The great bulk consisted of a mixture of Negroes from various parts of the West Coast, mainly introduced as slaves, and now all using a Negro Portuguese—“lingua de S. Thomé.” On the south-west coast are[9:21:201] about 1200 Angolares, descendants of a shipload of Angola slaves wrecked at Sete Pedras in 1544, who still retain their Bunda speech and peculiar customs.

St Thomas was discovered about the close of 1470 by the Portuguese navigators João de Santarem and Pero de Escobar, who in the beginning of the following year discovered Annobom (“Good Year”). They found St Thomas uninhabited. The first attempts at colonization were João de Paiva’s in 1485; but nothing permanent was accomplished till 1493, when a body of criminals and of young Jews torn from their parents to be baptized were sent to the island, and the present capital was founded by Alvaro de Carminha. Considerable progress had been made by the 16th century; but in 1567 the settlement was attacked by the French, and in 1574 the Angolares began those raids which only ended with their subjugation in 1693. In 1595 there was a slave revolt; and from 1641 to 1844 the Dutch, who had plundered the capital in 1600, held possession of the island. The French did great damage in 1709; and in the course of the century internal anarchy reduced St Thomas to a deplorable state.
