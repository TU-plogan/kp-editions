SCHWARZBURG-RUDOLSTADT, a small Thuringian principality and an independent member of the German empire, shares with Schwarzburg-Sondershausen the possessions of the old house of Schwarzburg, consisting of the upper barony (Oberherrschaft) in Thuringia, on the Gera, Ilm, and Saale, and the lower barony (Unterherrschaft), an isolated district on the Wipper and Helbe, about 25 miles to the north, surrounded by the Prussian province of Saxony. See plate V. As the dignity of prince is held in virtue of the Oberherrschaft alone, a share of both baronies was given to each sub-line of the main house. The total area of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is 363 square miles, of which 283 are in the upper and 80 in the lower barony; the chief towns in the former district are Rudolstadt (8747 inhabitants), the capital, and Blankenburg (1889), and in the latter Frankenhausen (4985). Both baronies are hilly, but no great height is anywhere attained. The scenery of the Thuringian portion of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt attracts many visitors annually, the most beautiful spots being the gorge of the Schwarza and the lovely circular valley in which the village of Schwarzburg nestles at the foot of a curiously isolated hill, crowned by the ancient castle of the princely line. Cattle-rearing and fruit-growing flourish in the lower barony, while the upper barony is finely wooded. Of the whole country 44 per cent. is under forest (mainly coniferous trees), and 41 per cent. is devoted to agriculture. The chief grain crops are rye, oats, and barley, but in 1883 thrice as much ground was occupied by potatoes as by all these three together. The live-stock returns in 1883 showed 19,831 cattle, 39,024 sheep, 19,544 pigs, 14,420 goats, and 2813 horses. Agriculture and forestry support about 35 per cent. of the population, and mining and cognate industries about 10 per cent. Trade and manufactures are insignificant; iron, lignite, cobalt, alum, and vitriol are among the mineral productions. In 1880 the population was 80,296 (an increase of 1779 since 1875), or about 221 to the square mile. Of these 79,832 were Protestants.

Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is a limited hereditary sovereignty, its constitution resting on laws of 1854 and 1870, though a diet has met at intervals since 1816. The present diet consists of sixteen members elected for six years, four chosen by the highest taxpayers, the others by general election. The diet must be summoned every three years. The budget for 1885-87 estimated revenue and expenditure each at £101,210; £57,670 was the estimated income from the public lands and forests. The public debt was £230,350. The troops of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt have been incorporated with the Prussian army since the convention of 1867. The principality has one vote in the Reichstag and one in the federal council.

Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is the cadet branch of the family. In 1710 the count was made a prince, in spite of the remonstrances of the elector of Saxony, although he was prevented from taking his seat in the imperial college until 1754. The principality entered the Confederation of the Rhine in 1807 and the German League in 1815. In 1819 it redeemed the Prussian claims of superiority by surrendering portions of its territory.
