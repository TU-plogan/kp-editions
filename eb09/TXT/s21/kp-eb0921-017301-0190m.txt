ST JOHN, Charles William George (1809-1856), naturalist and sportsman, was the son of General the Hon. Frederick St John, second son of Frederick, second viscount Bolingbroke, and was born 3d December 1809. He was educated at Midhurst School, Sussex, and about 1828 obtained a clerkship in the treasury, but, after joining some friends in various expeditions to the Highlands of Scotland, he found his duties so irksome that he resigned in 1834. The same year he married a lady with some fortune, and was thus enabled to gratify his taste for the life of a sportsman and naturalist. He ultimately settled in the “Laigh” of Moray, “within easy distance of mountain sport, in the midst of the game and wild animals of a low country, and with the coast indented by bays of the sea, and studded with freshwater lakes, the haunt of all the common wild fowl and many of the rarer sorts.” In 1853 a paralytic seizure permanently deprived him of the use of his limbs, and for the benefit of his health he removed to the south of England. He died at Wooston near Southampton on 22d July 1856.

He wrote several books on sport, which record the results of accurate observations on the habits and peculiarities of the birds and wild animals of the Highlands. They are written in a pleasant and graphic style, and illustrated with engravings, many of them from pen-and-ink sketches of his own, in which the traits and features of the animals are depicted, though in rough outline, yet with almost the vividness of life. His works are Wild Sports and Natural History of the Highlands (1846, 2d ed. 1848, 3d ed. 1861); Tour in Sutherland (1849, 2d ed., with recollections by Captain H. St John, 1884); Notes of Natural History and Sport in Morayshire, with Memoir by C. Innes (1863, 2d ed. 1884).
