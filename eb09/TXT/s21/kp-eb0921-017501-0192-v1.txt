ST JOHN’S, the capital of Newfoundland, is situated on the eastern shore of the island, 60 miles north of Cape Race, in 47° 33' 33" N. lat. and 52° 45' 10" W. long, (see vol. xvii., plate V.). It is 10° 52' east of Halifax, and stands on what is nearly the most eastern point of America, —Cape Spear, 5 miles south of St. John’s, alone projecting a little farther towards the Old World. It is 1000 miles nearer than New York to England, and but 1640 from the coast of Ireland. The approach to the harbour of St John’s presents one of the most picturesque views along the coast of America. In a lofty iron-bound coast a narrow opening occurs in the rocky wall, guarded on one side by Signal Hill (520 feet) and on the other by South Side Hill (620 feet), with Fort Amherst lighthouse on a rocky promontory at its base. The entrance of the Narrows is about 1400 feet in width, and at the narrowest point, between Pancake and Chain Rocks, the channel is not more than 600 feet wide. The Narrows are half a mile in length, and at their termination the harbour trends suddenly to the west, thus completely shutting out the swell from the ocean. Vessels of the largest tonnage can enter at all periods of the tide. The harbour is a mile in length and nearly half a mile in width. At its head is a dry dock, recently completed at a cost of $550,000; it is 600 feet in length, 83 in breadth, and 26 in depth, capable of admitting the largest steamers afloat. The city is built on sloping ground on the northern side of the harbour, on the southern side of which the hills rise so abruptly from the water that there is only room for a range of warehouses and oil-factories. Three principal streets, winding and irregular, follow the sinuosities of the harbour and of one another the whole length of the city, and these are intersected by a number of cross-streets. Water Street, the principal business locality, presents a very substantial, though not handsome, appearance, the houses being of stone or brick. Shops, stores, and counting-houses occupy the ground floor, while many of the merchants and shopkeepers live in the upper stories. Fish-stores, warehouses, and wharves project from behind on the side next the harbour. The city, three-fourths of which are still of[9:21:176] wood, is rapidly extending in several directions, and in recent years many dwelling-houses of an improved description have been erected. There is an abundant supply of excellent water, brought in pipes from a lake 5 miles off. Epidemics are rare, and the city is very healthy. Of the public buildings the most important are Government House, a substantial and spacious building erected in 1828 by the Imperial Government; the colonial building (1847), containing the chambers of the legislature and Government offices; the athenaeum (1877), containing a public hall, library, reading-room, savings bank, museum, &c. The foundation of a new post-office was laid in the same year. The churches are—the Church of England and Roman Catholic cathedrals, St Thomas’s and St Mary’s (Church of England), St Patrick’s, three Methodist churches, St Andrew’s Presbyterian church, and the Congregational church. The manufacture of seal and cod oils has long been carried on upon an extensive scale. Of late years other manufactures have been introduced, and have made considerable progress. There are three iron-foundries, two large machine-shops, two boot and shoe factories, a nail-factory, three furniture-factories, two tobaccofactories, soap-works, two tanneries, and a large and well-equipped factory for the manufacture of cables, ropes, twines, nets, seines, &c. The export trade in fish of various kinds, fish oils, seal oil, and seal skins is very large; the greater part of all the imports into Newfoundland also arrives at St John’s. The city is not yet (1886) incorporated, the Colonial Board of Works having charge of all civil affairs. The population, which in 1780 was 1605, had in 1801 increased to 3420, in 1812 to 7075, in 1835 to 15,000, and in 1874 to 23,890, and in 1884 it was 28,610 (Roman Catholics, 17,693; Episcopalians, 5741; Methodists, 3715; Presbyterians, 973; Congregationalists, 465; other denominations, 23). The census last mentioned also shows the population of the whole island and Labrador to be 197,589, being an increase of 36,209 since 1874, or at the rate of about 22 per cent. in ten years. The population of the Atlantic coast of Labrador, which is under the jurisdiction of Newfoundland, was 4211,—1347 being Eskimo.
