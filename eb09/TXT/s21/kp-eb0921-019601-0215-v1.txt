ST PIERRE and MIQUELON, two islands 10 miles off the south coast of Newfoundland (see vol. xvii. pl. V.), at the entrance of Fortune Bay, are, with five lesser islets, the last remnant of the North American colonies of France. Both are rugged masses of granite, with a few small streams and lakelets, a thin covering of soil, and scanty vegetation. Miquelon (area, 45,542 acres) consists of Great Miquelon in the north and Little Miquelon, Langlade, or Langley in the south; previous to 1783 they were separate islands divided by a navigable channel, but they have since become connected by a dangerous sandbar. St Pierre (6420 acres) has a good harbour and roadstead, the latter, protected by Íle aux Chiens, affording shelter, except in north-east storms, to the largest vessels. The small but busy town of St Pierre climbing the steep hill above the harbour is mainly built of wood; but it has a cathedral (of wood), an English chapel, a governor’s residence, and various administrative offices, including the American terminus of the French Atlantic cable. Cod-fishing, to which the settlement owes its prosperity, was prosecuted in the five years 1878-82, on an average, by 4560 fishermen (mainly from Dunkirk and other French ports), and produced 3876 tons of dried and 157,754 tons of undried cod, with 450 tons of cod-liver oil. The total exports and imports were valued, respectively, at 9,218,278 and 4,441,817 francs in 1865, and 17,164,153 and 11,062,617 francs in 1883. The foreign trade in 1883 was valued at 10,218,473 francs. The population of the islands was 5564 (town of St Pierre 4365) in 1883; but the number is often above 10,000 in the fishing-season.

St Pierre and Miquelon, with 3000 inhabitants, were ceded to England along with Newfoundland in 1713; but on the English conquest of Canada they were assigned to France as a fishery depot. Destroyed by the English in 1778, restored to France in 1783, again depopulated by the English in 1793, recovered by France in 1802 and lost in 1803, the islands have remained an undisputed French possession since 1816.
