SHILOH, a town of Ephraim, where the sanctuary of the ark was, under the priesthood of the house of Eli. According to 1 Sam. iii. 3, 15, this sanctuary was not a tabernacle but a temple, with doors. But the priestly narrator of Josh. xviii. 1 has it that the tabernacle was set up there by Joshua after the conquest. In Judges xxi. 19 sq. the yearly feast at Shiloh appears as of merely local character. Shiloh seems to have beep destroyed by the Philistines after the disastrous battle of Ebenezer; cf. Jeremiah vii. 12 sq. The position described in Judges, loc. cit. (cf. Onomastica, ed. Lagarde, p. 152), gives certainty to the identification with the modern Séilûn lying some 2 miles east-south-east of Lubbán (Lebonah), on the road from Bethel to Shechem. Here there is a ruined village, with a flat double-topped hill behind it, offering a strong position, which suggests that the place was a stronghold as well as a sanctuary. A smiling and fertile landscape surrounds the hill. The name Seilûn corresponds to Σ ιλούν in Josephus. LXX. has Σηλω, Σηλώμ. The forms given in the Hebrew Bible (r⅛tr, l5> ’ ty) have dropped the final consonant, which reappears in the adjective OiS ’ K ’ ∙ On Shiloh in Gen. xlix. 10 see Judah.
