ST OMER, a town and fortress of France, chef-lieu of the department of Pas-de-Calais, situated on the Aa (which flows into the North Sea), 177 miles north of Paris by the railway to Arras, Hazebrouck, and Calais, at the junction of a line to Boulogne. Before the modifications made in the defensive system of the frontier the place was a fortress of the first class. At St Omer begins the canalized portion of the Aa, which reaches the sea at Gravelines, and under its walls it connects with the Neuffossé, which ends at the Lys. There are two harbours outside and one within the city. St Omer has wide streets and spacious squares, but little stir of life. The old cathedral is the most curious church in Artois; it belongs almost entirely to the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. Of its four portals the finest, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, was decorated with statuettes, unfortunately mutilated during the Revolution. In spite of the spoliations of the 18th century, the contents of the church still comprise interesting paintings, a Virgin in wood of the 12th century (the object of numerous pilgrimages, and solemnly crowned in 1875), a colossal statue of Christ seated between the Virgin and St John (13th century, originally belonging to the cathedral of Thérouanne and presented by Charles V.), fine stained glass and mosaics, interesting tombstones, the cenotaph of St Omer, and numerous ex-votos, distinguished by their antiquity, originality, and delicacy of workmanship. The clearing of the church from the encroachments of other buildings has led to the reconstruction of the apsidial chapel of the Sacred Heart in the purest Gothic style. Of St Bertin, the church of the abbey (built between 1326 and 1520 on the site of previous churches), where Childeric III. retired to end his days, nothing now remains but some arches and a tower, 190 feet high, which serves to adorn the public gardens (once possessed by the monks). Several[9:21:188] other churches or convent chapels are of interest, but it is enough to mention St Sepulchre’s (14th century) for the sake of its beautiful stone spire and stained-glass windows. A fine collection of records, a picture gallery, and a theatre are all accommodated in the town-hall, built of the materials of the abbey of St Bertin. Among the five hospitals the military hospital is of note as occupying the college opened by the English Jesuits in 1592 and known as the place where O’Connell received his education. The old episcopal palace is used as a court-house. Several learned societies exist in the town; the public library contains 20,000 volumes and 1000 MSS. The arsenal is an extensive series of buildings. Besides 30,000,000 to 40,000,000 tobacco-pipes exported to America and the colonies, St Omer manufactures cloth, hosiery, and tulle, cambric, and muslin embroideries. Its trade (and it is the seat not only of a tribunal but also of a chamber of commerce) is mainly in provisions for England, the products of the local industry, and those of the paper-mills, flour-mills, distilleries, and sugar-factories in the vicinity, especially along the banks of the Aa. The suburb of Haut Pont to the north of St Omer is inhabited by a special stock, which has remained faithful to the Flemish tongue, its original costume, and its peculiar customs, and is distinguished by honesty and industry. The ground which these people cultivate has been reclaimed from the marsh, and the lègres (i.e ., the square blocks of land) communicate with each other only by boats floated on the ditches and canals that divide them. At the end of the marsh, on the borders of the forest of Clairmarais, are the ruins of the abbey founded in 1140 by Thierri d’Alsace, to which Thomas a Becket betook himself in 1165. To the south of St Omer on a hill commanding the Aa lies the camp of Helfaut, often called the camp of St Omer. On 15th June 1884 a statue was erected to Jacqueline Robin, a heroine who in the time of Louis XIV. saved St Omer from foreign occupation. The population of the town was 20,479 in 1881 (21,556 in the commune).

Near a castle named Sithiu, Omer, bishop of Thérouanne, erected churches and the monks of Luxeuil established monasteries in the 7th century; and in the 9th century the village thus originated took the name of its founder St Omer. The Normans laid the place waste in 861 and 881, but ten years later found town and monastery surrounded by walls and safe from their attack. Situated on the borders of territories frequently disputed by French, Flemish, English, and Spaniards, St Omer long continued subject to siege and military disaster. In 1071 Philip I. put all to sword and flame. Burned in 1136, captured in 1198 by Richard and Baldwin IX., attacked in 1214 by Ferrand of Portugal, in 1302 and 1303 by the Flemish, in 1337 and 1339 by the English, and in 1477 by Louis XL, St Omer at last fell in 1487 into the hands of Charles VIII. Two years later it was recovered by the archduke Maximilian; and Charles V. strengthened its ramparts with bastions. The French made five futile attempts against it between 1551 and 1596, and had no better success in 1638 (under Richelieu) or in 1647. But on 26th April 1677, after seventeen days’ siege, Louis XIV. forced the town to capitulate; and the peace of Nimeguen permanently confirmed the conquest. From time to time the people of St Omer (Audomarois) still celebrate the entrance into the town of William Cliton, count of Flanders, from whom in 1127 they obtained a communal charter granting them numerous privileges. St Omer ceased to be a bishopric in 1790.
