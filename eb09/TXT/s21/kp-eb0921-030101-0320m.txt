S√ÉO LEOPOLDO, a German colony in the province of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, founded in 1824. It is connected with Porto Alegre by rail and also by the Rio do Jinos, a small but deep and navigable river. The inhabitants of the town and sixteen neighbouring settlements number in all about 20,000, and are engaged in cattle-breeding and in the culture of grain, arrow-root, and sugar.
