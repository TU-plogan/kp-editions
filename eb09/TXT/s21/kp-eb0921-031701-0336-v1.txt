SATALI, Adalia, or Andaliyeh, one of the principal towns on the south coast of Asia Minor, giving the name of Gulf of Adalia to the great bay which the ancients styled Mare Pamphylicum. Arranged like a Greek theatre round the harbour, it presents an unusually picturesque appearance against its background of mountains; and it is enclosed by a triple wall of modern construction, strengthened by a ditch and square towers. Several of the mosques and churches, seventeen in number, are of interest, and contain remains of Roman work. The population was estimated by Spratt at 13,000, of whom 3000 were Greeks. Though the physical changes produced on this part of the coast by the tufaceous deposits of the rivers render the ancient descriptions quite inapplicable to the present town, there is little doubt that Satali not only preserves the name but occupies the site of Attaleia, which was founded by Attalus II. Philadelphus, king of Pergamum, and became one of the principal cities of Pamphylia. At an early date it was the see of a Christian bishop.
