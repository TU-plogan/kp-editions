ST VINCENT, an island in the West Indies, discovered by Columbus in 1498, is situated in 13° 10' N. lat. and 60° 57' W. long., 100 miles to the west of Barbados; it is 18 miles in length, 11 in breadth, and has an area of 132 square miles. Volcanic hills cross the island from north to south, intersected by beautiful and fertile valleys. In the north-west is the Souffriere, a volcanic mountain (3000 feet), of which the last violent eruption was in 1812; the crater is 3 miles in circumference and 500 feet in depth. The climate is humid and tolerably healthy (average rainfall nearly 80 inches). In 1627, when Charles I. granted St Vincent to the earl of Carlisle, it was peopled by Caribs; in 1672 it was given to Lord Willoughby, and in 1722 was granted, along with other islands, to the duke of Montagu by George I. After hostilities with the French and Caribs, it passed definitively to Great Britain in 1783. Immigrants were afterwards introduced and plantations cultivated; the chief products are sugar, rum, molasses, and arrowroot. The capital is Kingstown (population, 5593), the total population of the island being 42,200, including 2700 Europeans and 30,000 Africans. The island was formerly under the general government of the Windward Islands, Barbados being headquarters; but in 1885 Barbados was made a separate government, and Grenada, St Vincent, Tobago, and St Lucia were placed under a governor. The legislative council of St Vincent is composed of official members and others nominated by the crown. In 1883 the revenue and expenditure were respectively £34,509 and £32,962, the debt being £2840. The tonnage entered and cleared was 172,989, the imports and exports being valued at £148,286 and £166,752 respectively (sugar exports, 9250 tons).
