SAVOIE, HAUTE -, a frontier department of France, formed in 1860 from the old provinces of Genevois, Chablais, and Faucigny, which constituted the northern half of the duchy of Savoy in the kingdom of Sardinia. Situated between 45° 40' and 46° 25' N. lat. and between 5° 50' and 7° 2' E. long., it is bounded N. by the Lake of Geneva, E. by the Valais canton, S.E. by the duchy of Aosta (Italy), S. and S.W. by the department of Savoie, W. by the department of Ain, from which it is separated by the Rhone, and N.W. by the canton of Geneva. Almost everywhere except in the last direction the boundaries are natural. The greater portion of the department is occupied by mountains usually under 8000 feet in height; but it includes Mont Blanc (15,781 feet), while the confluence of the Fier with the Rhone is only 950 feet above the sea. The streams are torrential, and they all join the Rhone either directly or by the Lake of Geneva or the Isère. Most important is the Arve which crosses the department from south-east to north-west from Mont Blanc to Geneva by Chamonix, Sallanches, and Bonneville, receiving from the right the Giffre and from the left the Borne. The Dranse falls into the Lake of Geneva between Evian and Thonon. Direct tributaries of the Rhone are the Usses and the Fier, the outflow of the Lake of Annecy. Passing Mégève, to the south-west of Chamonix, the Arly goes to the Isère. A remarkable variety of climate is produced by the differences of altitude and exposure; it is mildest on the banks of the Lake of Geneva. Annecy has a moderate temperature, lower than that of Paris; bat some parts of the shores of the lake, well sheltered and having a good exposure, form health resorts even in winter. The rainfall on the Lake of Geneva hardly exceeds 24 inches; it is three times as heavy in the mountains.

Of the total area of 1,066,229 acres 345,959 acres are arable, 214,990 woodland, 132,206 uncultivated, 95,880 pasturage, 91,432 meadows, 21,252 vineyards. The live stock in 1880 comprised 9774 horses, 93,171 cows or heifers, 11,272 calves, 18,769 pigs, 25,331 goats, 33,000 sheep (wool-clip 41 tons), 21,525 hives (104 tons of honey, 38 of wax). Cheese is produced to the value of £220,000, and butter to £132,000. The harvest in 1883 included —wheat, 1,472,381 bushels; meslin, 196,510; rye, 190,503. For 1880 the returns were—barley, 136,043 bushels; buckwheat, 88,178; maize, 10,928; oats, 793,721; potatoes, 3,730,800; pulse, 42,507; chestnuts, 66,462; besides beetroot, hemp, flax, and colza. In 1883 the vintage was 3,221,834 gallons, the average for 1873- 1882 being 3,199,570, and cider was produced to the amount of 757,922 gallons (average 742,808). Tobacco is successfully grown in a part of the department (Rumilly). Though much of the wood has been cut down, Haute-Savoie still contains fine pine forests below 7200 feet of altitude, and fir, larch, and beech woods below 5000 feet, the limit of the elm and ash being 4250, and that of the oak 4000. Splendid walnuts and chestnuts are to be found as high up as 2950 feet and hazels as high as 3600. Argentiferous lead orcs and copper, iron, and manganese ores exist, but are not much worked. About 1000 tons of anthracite and lignite were raised in 1882, and 12,405 tons of asphaltic limestone. Jasper and other beautiful marble, freestone largely used in the buildings of Lyons and Chambéry, limestone, and slates are all quarried. Mineral waters of various kinds abound (Amphion and Evian, chalybeate; St Gervais at the foot of Mont Blanc, hot, sulphurous, and chalybeate; Menthon, sulphurous; La Caille, hot, sulphurous). Cotton manufacture is carried on at Annecy, where one establishment has 20,000 spindles, 600 power-looms, and 100 hand-looms, employing[9:21:333] 500 workers. Some 500,000 or 600,000 yards of silk stuffs are woven throughout the department by some 850 workers; and wool-spinning and wool manufactures are also carried on. In the iron industry 1921 tons of cast-iron and 1956 tons of malleable iron were manufactured in 1882. Clock-making, taught in two special schools, employs 2000 hands. Tanneries, paper-mills, tile-works, aud flour-mills are numerous. About two-thirds of the cantons have the advantage of belonging to the neutral customs zone—that is, have the right of introducing foreign goods duty free, with the exception of powder and tobacco. Coal, cotton, metals, and provisions are imported; cheese, cattle, timber, leather, asphalt, building stone, and calico are exported. The national roads make a total of 193 miles, other roads 3100 miles, and the railways—Annecy to Aix-les-Bains and to Annemasse, on the line from Bellegarde to Evian—96 miles. With its 274,087 inhabitants (1881), who all speak French and are almost exclusively Roman Catholics, Haute-Savoie is only about one-tenth below the average density of France. It forms the diocese of Annecy; the court of appeal and the university academy are at Chambéry, and the department is included in the 14th corps d’armée district (Grenoble). There are 4 arrondissements—Annecy (population of town 11,000), Bonneville (2270), St Julien (1500), and Thonon (5440),—28 cantons, and 314 communes.
