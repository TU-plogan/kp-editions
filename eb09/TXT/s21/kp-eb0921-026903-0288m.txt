SAN SEVERO, a city of Italy, in the province of Foggia, and at one time the chief town of the Capitanata, lies at the foot of the spurs of Monte Gargano, and has a station on the railway to Brindisi, 36 miles south-east of Termoli and 17 north of Foggia. It is the see of a bishop (since 1580), and has a handsome cathedral and some remains of its old fortifications. In 1880 the population was 19,756 (20,382 in commune).

San Severo dates from the Middle Ages. It was laid in ruins by Frederick II., and in 1053 was the scene of a victory by Robert Guiscard over the papal troops under Leo IX. The overlordship was held in succession by the Benedictines of Torre Maggiore abbey, the Knights Templars, the crown of Naples, and the Sangro family (commendatories of Torre Maggiore). In 1627, and again in 1828 and 1851, the town suffered from earthquakes.

from the slopes of eastern Kabulistan down to the land of the five rivers (Punjab), and thence to the plains of the Yamuna (Jumna) and Ganga (Ganges). Numerous special coincidences, both of language and mythology, between the Vedic Aryans and the peoples of Iran also show that these two members of the Indo-Germanic family must have remained in close connexion for some considerable period after the others had separated from them.
