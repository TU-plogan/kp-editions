ST BRIEUC, a town of France, chef-lieu of the department of Côtes du Nord, 295 miles west of Paris by the railway from Brest, at the junction of a branch to Vannes by Pontivy. It stands 290 feet above the sea, between 1 and 2 miles from the English Channel, where Légué, on the left bank of the Gouet, serves as its seaport. About 600 vessels, with an aggregate of 27,600 tons, enter or clear per annum; the local shipowners take part especially in the Newfoundland and Iceland fisheries. St Brieuc is an old town with a considerable number of curious houses. The principal articles of trade are grain, flax, hemp, vegetables, honey, cider, butter, and eggs, which are despatched to England, and fish and game, which are sent in considerable quantities to Paris. At the fairs in bygone days the Breton women sold their hair for trifling sums. Nurseries of some size exist at St Brieuc, and in the neighbourhood are quarries of blue granite, giving employment to 300 workmen. St Brieuc is the seat of a bishopric in the province of Rennes, and has a cathedral dating from the 13th century, but partially rebuilt in the 18th, and extensively restored recently. The tombs of the bishops, the modern but delicately carved organ-loft, the tapestries, and the stained-glass windows deserve mention. The old monastery of the Capuchins is occupied by the civil hospital. The monastery of the Cordeliers contains the lycée, a library of 30,000 volumes, and a museum of archaeology and natural history, and the convent of the Ursulines has been turned into barracks. The episcopal palace, the prefecture, and the town-house were formerly private mansions, a class of old buildings which is steadily being reduced in number by the opening of new streets. A colossal image of the Virgin looks down upon the towm, and the Duguesclin boulevard, on the site of the ramparts, has a statue of that hero. The population in 1881 was 14,869 (commune 17,833).

St Brieuc owes its origin and its name to the missionary St Briocus, who came from Wales in the 5th century, and whose tomb afterwards attracted crowds of pilgrims. The place was defended in

1375 by Olivier de Clisson against the duke of Brittany, and again attacked by the same Clisson in 1394, the cathedral suffering greatly in both sieges. In 1592 the town was pillaged by the Spaniards, in 1601 ravaged by the plague, and in 1628 surrounded by walls, of which no traces remain. Between 1602 and 1708 the states of Brittany several times met at St Brieuc, and during the Reign of Terror Chouans and Blues carried on a ruthless conflict with each other.
