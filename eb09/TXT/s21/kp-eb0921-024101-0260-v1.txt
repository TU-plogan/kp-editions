SALZKAMMERGUT, a district in the south-west angle of Upper Austria, between Salzburg and Styria, famous for its fine scenery, forms a separate imperial domain about 250 square miles in area, and with a population of over 18,000. The beauty of its lofty mountains, sequestered lakes, and green valleys has made it one of the favourite tourist resorts of Europe, and has gained for it the title of the “Austrian Switzerland”; but it owes its name (literally “salt-exchequer property ”) and its economic importance to its extensive and valuable salt mines. The chief lakes are the Traunsee or Lake of Gmunden, the Lake of Hallstatt, the Attersee or Kammersee (the largest lake in Austria), the Mondsee, and the St Wolfgang Lake. The principal mountains are the Dachstein (9849 feet), Thorstein (9659 feet), the Todte Gebirge with the summits of Priel (8238 feet) and others, and the Höllengebirge (6371 feet). The Schafberg (5840 feet) or “Austrian Rigi” and the Traunstein (5548 feet), isolated peaks among the lakes, are well-known tourist points. In the very heart of the salt-yielding district lies the fashionable spa of Ischl; but the capital of the Salzkammergut is Gmunden, situated on the Traunsee at the exit of the Traun, the chief river of the district. Cattle-rearing and forestry are carried on to a certain extent by the people, but between 6000 and 7000 of them are engaged in the salt-mines and evaporating works, which yield annually about 60,000 tons of salt. The sale of the salt is an Austrian crown-monopoly. The most important salt-works are at Ischl, Hallstatt, Ebensee, and Aussee. See Salt.
