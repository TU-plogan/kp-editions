SAVOIE, a department of south-eastern France, formed in 1860 of the districts of Upper Savoy, Savoy proper, Tarentaise, and Maurienne, which formed the southern part of the province of Savoy in the kingdom of Sardinia.[9:21:332] Situated between 45° 5' and 45° 55' N. lat. and between 5° 37' and 7° 5' E. long., it is bounded N. by the department of Haute-Savoie, N.W. by Ain, W. by Isère, S. by Hautes-Alpes, and S.E. and E. by Piedmont (Italy), the limits for the most part consisting of ridges of the Alps, and on the N.W. being determined by the Rhone and its affluents the Fier and the Guier. The highest point in the Vanoise group of mountains is 12,668 feet above the sea, while the Rhone leaves the department at a height of 695 feet, and the Isère about 800. Some details in regard to the orography will be found under Alps (q.v.). The Isère flows east and west through the Tarentaise valley by Bourg St Maurice, Moutiers, Albertville, and Montmelian; its principal tributary the Arc flows along the Maurienne valley used by the Mont Cenis Railway. The lake of Bourget discharges into the Rhone by the Savières canal. The climate of the department varies according to altitude and exposure. At Chambéry and Aix-les-Bains the average temperature is a little lower than that of Paris, but the rainfall is about 65 inches per annum, and this amount goes on increasing as the higher regions are reached.

With a total area of 1,423,254 acres, Savoy comprises 434,921 acres of uncultivated ground, 239,700 acres of arable, 205,105 in forests, 172,980 in meadows, 27,183 in vineyards. More than the half of the inhabitants (194,704 out of 266,438) are engaged in agriculture. In 1881 there were in the department 97,487 cows, 19,328 oxen, 2570 horses, 3156 asses, 4207 mules, 98,826 sheep, (40 tons of wool), 19,428 pigs, 25,527 goats. About 1,870,000,000 gallons of milk are produced and 2463 tons of butter and 5911 tons of cheese are manufactured, of a total value of £500,000. From the 19,600 beehives were obtained in 1881 87 tons of honey and 16 of wax. The grape ripens up to an altitude of 2625 feet, and is cultivated to an altitude of 3940. Several growths of Savoy are in great repute and the vineyards were (before the invasion of the phylloxera) one of the most important products of the department. Tobacco is also cultivated. In 1883 the crops comprised wheat, 404,665 bushels; meslin, 104,500; rye, 679,668; barley, 212,883; buckwheat, 20,641; maize, 245,245; oats, 722,067; potatoes, 1,244,603; pulse, 54,120; chestnuts, 72,036; beetroot, 14,040 tons; tobacco, 350 tons; hemp, 585 tons; colza-seed, 284 tons; hempseed, 195 tons; wine, 3,895,496 gallons (annual average 4,128,520 gallons); cider, 137,258 gallons (average 69,058 gallons). Notwithstanding deplorable clearances, Savoy still possesses considerable woods of pine, larch, beech, &c. The chestnut, of which the finest specimens are in the neighbourhood of Aix-les-Bains, grows, as do also the walnut and hazel, to a height of 3600 feet, the oak to 3900, the elm and the ash to 4250, the fir to 4900, and the pine to 7200. The department contains one of the richest deposits of spathic iron in Europe, and the Creusot Company employs 700 hands in working it. Argentiferous lead and copper have also been occasionally worked. The Maurienne and the Tarcntaise are rich in anthracite, and yielded in 1882 16,687 tons of fuel. Peat covers 1413 acres, with a thickness varying from 8 inches to 8 feet, and there are rich beds of different kinds of marble, fifty-two quarries of building stone, and quarries of limestone, plaster, cement, and slate, as well as deposits of black lead, jet, asbestos, talc, mica, ochre, sulphate of baryta, zinc, antimony, arsenic, manganese, titanium, sulphur. The department is particularly rich in mineral waters, and the most famous, those of Aix-les-Bains (hot sulphurous) were frequented in the time of the Romans. The waters at Marlioz in the neighbourhood are sulphurous or alkaline (iodine, bromine). Those of Challes near Chambéry rank among the most powerful of the natural sulphurous waters. The Sal ins-Moutiers waters in the Tarentaise are hot, saline, and rich in various minerals; the hot springs of Brides-les-Bains in the same region are rich in the sulphates of soda and calcium. Silk is the leading object of industry in the department (31 tons of cocoons in 1883). The winding of the cocoons, the milling of the silk (3500 “tavalles” and spindles), and the weaving of the silk-fabrics (803 looms, 55 being hand-looms) employ more than 1700 workmen, and the goods manufactured are valued at £380,000. Chambéry produces 71,000 yards of high-class gauze, 3000 yards of velvet, 13,000 yards of handkerchiefs, and some 800,000 yards of taffetas and various other silk stuffs. Linen manufactures employ 400 looms, woollen manufactures 1850 spindles. The peasants manufacture about 125,000 yards of coarse woollen stuffs from their home-grown wool. The blast furnaces and iron-works produced in 1881 176 tons of manufactured iron. Tanneries, paper-mills, paperpulp factories, brick-works, saw-mills, flour-mills, &c., are all of some importance in the department, which counts altogether sixty-one establishments with steam-engines of (aggregate) 271 horse power. The number of inhabitants engaged in industrial pursuits is 24,482, in commerce 14,016. Coal, skins, cotton, provisions are imported; cattle, cheese, butter, wood, stones, and various building materials, mineral waters, silk stuffs, tanned leather, and paper are exported. There are 204 miles of national roads, 2518 miles of other roads, and 150 miles of railroad. The population was 266,438 in 1881. The department forms the three dioceses of Chambéry (archbishopric), Moutiers, and St Jean-de-Maurienne; the court of appeal and university academy are at Chambéry, and the headquarters of the corps d’armée to which it belongs (the 14th) are at Grenoble. There are four arrondissements,—Chambéry (16,000 inhabitants in the town), Albertville (5000), Moutiers (2000), St Jean-de-Maurienne (3000),—29 cantons, and 328 communes. Aix-les-Bains (4741), owing to its hot springs, is the most important place in the department.
