SCHONGAUER, or Shoen, Martin (1450- c . 1488), the most able engraver and painter of the early German school. His father was a goldsmith named Casper, a native of Augsburg, who had settled at Colmar, where the chief part of Martin’s life was spent.^[1. The date of Schongauer’s birth is usually given wrongly as c. 1420; he was really bom about thirty years later, and is mentioned by A. Durer as being a young apprentice in 1470. His portrait in the Munich Pinakothek is now known to be a copy by Burgkmair, painted after 1510, from an original of 1483,—not 1453 as has been supposed. The date of Schongauer’s death, 1499, written on the back of the panel by Burgkmair is obviously a blunder; see Hensler in Naurnann's Archiv, 1867, p. 129, and Wurzbach, M. Schongauer, Vienna, 1880. These contradict the view of Goutzwiller, in his Martin Schongauer et son École, Paris, 1875. Cf. Schnaase, “Gesch. M. Schongauers,” in the Mittheil. der K. K. Commission, 1863, No. 7.] Schongauer established at Colmar a very important school of engraving, out of which grew the “little masters” of the succeeding generation, and a large group of Nuremberg artists. As a painter, Schongauer was a pupil of the Flemish Roger Van der Weyden the Elder, and his rare existing pictures closely resemble, both in splendour of colour and exquisite minuteness of execution, the best works of contemporary art in Flanders. Among the very few paintings which can with certainty be attributed to him, the chief is a magnificent altarpiece in the church of St Martin, at Colmar, representing the Virgin and Child, crowned by Angels, with a background of roses—a work of the highest beauty, and large in scale, the figures being nearly life size. The Colmar Museum possesses eleven panels by his hand, and a small panel of David with Goliath’s Head in the Munich Gallery is attributed to him. The miniature painting of the Death of the Virgin in the English National Gallery is probably the work of some pupil.^[2. Another painting of the same subject in the Doria Palace in Rome (usually attributed to Dürer) is given to Schongauer by Crowe and Cavalcaselle, Flemish Painters, London, 1872, p. 359; but the execution is not equal to Schongauer’s wonderful touch.] In 1488 Schongauer died at Colmar, according to the register of St Martin’s church.

The main work of Schongauer’s life was the production of a large number of most highly finished and beautiful engravings, which were largely sold, not only in Germany, but also in Italy and even in England. In this way his influence was very widely extended. Vasari speaks of him with much enthusiasm, and says that Michelangelo copied one of his engravings—the Trial of St Anthony.^[3. An interesting example of Schongauer’s popularity in Italy is given by the lovely Faenza plate in the British Museum, on which is painted a copy of Martin’s beautiful engraving of the Death of the Virgin; see Pottery, vol. xix. p. 627.] Schongauer was known in Italy by the names “Bel

Martino” and “Martino d’Anversa.” His subjects are always religious; more than 130 prints from copper by his hand are still known, and about 100 more are the production of his bottega. ^[4. See Bartsch, Peintre Graveur, and Willshire, Ancient Prints, best edition of 1877. According to a German tradition Schongauer was the inventor of printing from metal plates; he certainly was one of the first who brought the art to perfection. See an interesting article by Sidney Colvin in the Jahrbuch der k. prevssischen Kunstsammlung, vi. p. 69, Berlin, 1885.] Most of his pupils’ plates as well as his own are signed M + S. Among the most beautiful of Schongauer’s engravings are the series of the Passion and the Death and Coronation of the Virgin, and the series of the Wise and Foolish Virgins; as much as £420 has been given for a fine state of the Coronation plate. All are remarkable for their miniature-like treatment, their brilliant touch, and their chromatic force. Some, such as the Death of the Virgin and the Adoration of the Magi, are richly-filled compositions of many figures, treated with much largeness of style in spite of their minute scale. Though not free from the mannerism of his age and country, Schongauer possessed a rare feeling for beauty and for dignity of pose; and in technical power over his graver and copper plate he has never been surpassed.

The British Museum possesses a fine collection of Schongauer’s prints. Fine facsimiles of his engravings have been produced by Amand-Durand with text by Duplessis, Paris, 1881.
