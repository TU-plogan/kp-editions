SEVILLE, a Spanish province—one of the eight into which Andalusia is divided—and formerly one of the four Moorish kingdoms, is bounded on the S. by Malaga and Cadiz, on the W. by Huelva, on the N. by Badajoz, and on the E. by Cordova. The superficial area is 5429 square miles, and in 1877 the population numbered 505,291. Northwards the province is broken up by low spurs of the Sierra Morena, the summits of which in the extreme north rise to a considerable height; but in the southern and larger half the ground is flat and fertile, and the only mountainous part is the frontier line formed by the Sierra de Ronda. The Guadalquivir traverses the province from north-east to south-west and receives in its course the waters of several streams, the chief being the Genil and the Guadaira on the left, and the Guadalimar to the right. The province is one of the most productive and flourishing in Spain, and grows all kinds of grain and vegetables. Oil and wine, oranges and olives, are among its chief exports, while tobacco, leather, paper, spirits, chocolate, textile fabrics of silk and wool, soap, glass, and earthenware are amongst its manufactures. Sheep and oxen, horses and asses, are reared on its pastures; and in the mountainous districts there are copper, silver, lead, iron, coal, and salt mines, and quarries of chalk and marble. Commerce has made great strides of late years owing to the opening up of the country by railways, and foreign capital has developed the natural resources of the district. The province is divided for administrative purposes into fourteen partidos judiciales and ninety-eight ayuntamientos,[9:21:708] and is represented in the cortes by four senators and twelve deputies. The following towns have a population of more than 10,000 within the municipal boundaries :— Seville (see below), Carmona (17,426), Constantina (10,988), Écija (24,955), Lebrija (12,864), Marchena (13,768), Moron de la Frontera (14,879), Osuna (17,211), and Utrera (15,093).
