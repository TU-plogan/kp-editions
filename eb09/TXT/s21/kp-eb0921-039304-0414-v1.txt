SCHETKY, John Christian (1778-1874), marine painter, descended from an old Transylvanian family, was born in Edinburgh on the 11th of August 1778. He studied art under Alexander Nasmyth, and after having[9:21:394] travelled on the Continent he settled in Oxford, and taught for six years as a drawing-master. In 1808 he obtained a post in the military college, Great Marlow, and three years later he received a congenial appointment as professor of drawing in the naval college, Portsmouth, where he had ample opportunities for the study of his favourite marine subjects. From 183G to 1855 he held a similar professorship in the military college, Addiscombe. To the Royal Academy exhibitions he contributed at intervals from 1805 to 1872, and he was represented at the Westminster Hall competition of 1847 by a large oil-painting of the Battle of La Hogue. He was marine painter to George IV., William IV., and Queen Victoria. Among his published works are the illustrations to Lord John Manners’s Cruise in Scotch Waters, and a volume of photographs from his pictures and drawings issued in 1867 under the title of Veterans of the Sea. He died in London, on the 28th of January 1874.

One of his best works, the Loss of the Royal George, painted in 1840, is in the National Gallery, London, and the United Service Club possesses another important marine subject from his brush. His memoir by his daughter was published in 1877.
