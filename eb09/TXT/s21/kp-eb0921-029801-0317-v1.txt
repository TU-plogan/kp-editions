SANTANDER (Partus Blendium, Fanum S. Andreae), capital of the above province, 316 miles by rail from Madrid, is the seat of a bishopric and one of the chief seaports of Spain. The population in 1877 numbered 41,000, having almost doubled in the preceding quarter of a century, and the trade of the port has increased in an even greater proportion. The town is situated on the inside of a rocky peninsula, which separates it from the Bay of Biscay and forms a magnificent harbour from 2 to 3 miles wide and 4 miles long. The entrance is at the eastern extremity of the promontory, and, though somewhat difficult for sailing vessels in certain winds, has depth of water sufficient for the largest ships. The total burthen of the vessels entered in 1882 amounted to 104,449 tons British and 500,342 tons of other nations. The chief exports consisted of iron ore (20,966 tons) to Great Britain, and wine (191,400 galls.) and olive oil (8000 galls.) to France. The city is divided into an upper and a lower town, and contains few buildings of interest. The cathedral was originally a Gothic structure, but has been so altered by later additions that little of the old work remains. In the crypt, or Capilla del Cristo de Abajo, there is a font of Moorish workmanship which has some interest. The castle of S. Felice contains a prison which was probably the first example of the radiating system of construction. Besides these buildings there are the theatre, which was formerly a convent, the hospital, and the Jesuits’ church. The city is essentially modern, and its chief features are its well-built houses, its quays, and its factories. In addition to the manufactures of the province mentioned above, Santander has gas-works, phosphorus, sulphuric acid, and sail manufactories, and a large cigar factory, formerly a convent, where over 1000 hands are employed. Besides being a trading port Santander is also a watering-place which enjoys peculiar advantages of climate. The bathing establishment of the Sardinero, on the seaward side of the strip of land the town is built on, offers all the attractions usual to Continental watering-places. There is communication by rail with Madrid and by steamer with Liverpool, London, and Hamburg, as well as with Havana and the seaports of Spain.

The port was in 1753 made one of the “puertos habilitados” or ports privileged to trade with America, and in 1755 it was created a “ciudad.” Charles V. landed here in 1522 when he came to take possession of the Spanish crown, and from this port Charles I. of England embarked on his return from his ill-fated visit incognito in search of a wife. The city was sacked by the French under Soult in 1808; but so little gratitude did the people show to their English allies that it was with the greatest difficulty supplies were found for the troops.
