SERINGAPATAM, formerly the capital of Mysore, India, is situated on an island of the same name in the Kaveri (Cauvery) river in 12° 25' 33" N. lat. and 76° 43' 8 ' E. long. It is chiefly noted for its fortress, which figured so prominently in Indian history at the close of the 18th century. This formidable stronghold of Tipu Sultan thrice sustained a siege from the British, but it was finally stormed in 1799; and after its capture the island was ceded to the British. The island of Seringapatam is about 3 miles in length from east to west and 1 in breadth, and yields valuable crops of rice and sugar-cane. The fort occupies the western side of the island, immediately overhanging the river. Seringapatam is said to have been founded in 1454 by a descendant of one of the local officers appointed by Rámánuja, the Vishnuite apostle, who named it the city of Srí Ranga or Vishnu. At the eastern or lower end of the island is the Lal Bagh or “red garden,” containing the mausoleum built by Tipu Sultan for his father Hyder Ali, in which Tipu himself also lies. In 1881 the population of the town of Seringapatam was 11,734 (males 5579, females 6155).
