SHADDOCK(Citrus decumana) is a tree allied to the orange and the lemon, presumably native to the Malay and Polynesian islands, but generally cultivated throughout the tropics. The leaves are like those of the orange, but downy on the under surface, as are also the young shoots. The flowers are large and white, and are succeeded by very large globose or pear-shaped fruits like oranges, but paler in colour, and with less flavour. The name Shaddock is asserted to be that of a captain who introduced the tree to the West Indies. The fruit is also known under the name of pommeloes and “forbidden fruit.” There are two varieties commonly met with, one with pale and the other with red pulp.
