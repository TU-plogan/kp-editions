SCHALCKEN, Godfried (1643—1706), genre and portrait painter, was born at Dort in 1643, and studied under Van Hoogstraten, and afterwards under Gerhard Douw, whose works his earlier genre-pictures very closely resemble. He visited England and painted several portraits, of which the half-length of William III., now in the Museum, Amsterdam, is a good example. In this work he shows an effect of candle-light, which he also introduced— frequently with fine effect—in many of his subject-pictures. These may be studied in the collections at Buckingham Palace, the Louvre, Vienna, and Dresden. He executed several Scriptural subjects—such as that of the Wise and Foolish Virgins, at Munich—of very indifferent merit. He died at The Hague in 1706.
