SALEIYER (in Mancassarese Silâyara, in Buginese Silâja), also called Tana-dowang (“Land of Shrimps ”), is a Dutch island separated from the south coast of Celebes (East Indies) by a strait 8 miles wide, which in the west monsoon is used by vessels bound for the Moluccas, the Philippines, and China. With a length of 46 miles and general breadth of 9, the area is estimated at 315 square miles. Along the east side of the island is a belt of volcanic rock; the west side is of limestone or coralline formation. The highest point seems to be Haru on the east coast, but estimates of its altitude vary from 1000 to 3000 feet. There are no navigable rivers, and many of the streams dry up in the west monsoon. Besides most of the ordinary tropical fruits, the cultivated plants comprise Indian corn, barley, potatoes, tobacco, coffee, and indigo, and among the trees are cocoanut and areng palms, kanari, ebony, and teak (the last considered the property of the Dutch Government). Horses, buffaloes, goats, and sheep are kept, and pigs and deer exist in a wild state. The population of Saleiyer and dependencies, mainly a mixed race of Mancassars, Buginese, and natives of Luvu and Buton, was in 1869 55,147, and in 1880 66,276. They use the Mancassar language, are for the most part nominally Mahommedans (though many heathen customs survive), and support themselves by agriculture, fishing, seafaring, trade, the preparation of salt (on the south coast), and the weaving of clothing materials. Field work is largely performed by a servile class. Raw and prepared cotton, tobacco, trepang, tortoise-shell, cocoanuts and cocoanut oil, and salt are the principal articles of export.

The island is divided into nine regencies :—Tanette, Batammata (Batangmata; including the former regency of Onto), Buki, Mare-Mare, Bonêya—all five in the north—Bontobangung, Balla-bulo, Layolo, and Barambarang—in the south. Panggiliyang or Benteng on the west coast, often called also Saleiyer, is the capital of the island. It stands in 6° 3' 3" S. lat. and 120° 31' 48" E. long., and possesses the best harbour on the whole coast, being protected by Pulo Pasi or Hog Island (also Sariwa or Pulo Babi). To the Saleiyer group belong a variety of small islands, for the most part uninhabited—Tana Jampêya (the largest of all with a good anchorage at Maringi Bay), Gowang, Malimbu, &c. Previous to the Dutch occupation the Saleiyers were subject to the king of Ternate.
