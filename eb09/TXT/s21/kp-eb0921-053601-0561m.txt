SCOTLAND, Church of. In the article Presbyterianism the history of the Church of Scotland was brought down to the middle of the 18th century, and the story of the secessions of 1733 and 1751 was there told. We take up here the church’s history at the beginning of the “Moderate” rule. Her annals during the next three-quarters of a century are singularly uneventful. In close alliance with the state, she increases in power and dignity, and becomes the home of letters and philosophy. But there is no great movement of a theological nature, no striking religious development to lend her popular interest.

The strength of the church as well as her tendency to moderation arose in great part out of the political circumstances of the early part of the 18th century. Presbytery, being loyal to the house of Hanover, while Episcopacy was Jacobite, enjoyed the royal favour and was treated as a firm ally of the Government. The Patronage Act of 1712 threw the filling up of parishes into the hands of those well-affected to the Government, and the example of the mode of patronage practised in England may have tended to promote a disregard of the religious feelings of the people. The effect on the clergy was to encourage them to seek the friendship of the landed gentry and to regard the higher rather than the lower orders of society as their natural allies, so that they were at the same time led to liberal ways of thinking and rendered largely independent of their congregations.

It is remarked by Dr Hill Burton, and Carlyle repeats the remark, that “Scots dissent never was a protest against the principles of the church, but always tended to preserve the old principles of the church, whence the Establishment—by the progress of enlightenment as some said, by deterioration according to others—was lapsing.” The secessions carried off the more fervent elements; yet enough of the old leaven always remained to exert a powerful influence. Thus, while the church as a whole was more peaceful, more courtly, more inclined to the friendship of the world than at any former time, it contained two well-marked parties, in one of which these characteristics of the religion of the 18th century were more marked than in the other. The Moderate party, which maintained its ascendency till the beginning of the 19th century, and impressed its character on the church, sought to make the working of the church in its different parts as systematic and regular as possible, to make the assembly supreme and enforce respect for its decisions by presbyteries, and to render the judicial procedure of the church as exact and formal as that of the civil courts. The popular party, regarding the church less from the side of the Government, had less sympathy with the progressive movements of the age, and desired greater strictness in discipline. The main subject of dispute arose at first from the exercise of patronage. Presbyteries in various parts of the country were still disposed to disregard the presentations of lay patrons, and to settle the men desired by the people; but legal decisions[9:21:537] had shown that if they acted in this way their nominee, while legally minister of the parish, could not claim the stipend. To the risk of such sacrifices the church, led by the Moderate party, refused to expose herself. By the new policy inaugurated by Dr Robertson, which led to the second secession, the assembly compelled presbyteries to give effect to presentations, and in a long series of disputed settlements the “call,” though still held essential to a settlement, was less and less regarded, until it was declared that it was not necessary, and that the church courts were bound to induct any qualified presentee. The substitution of the word “concurrence” for “call” about 1764 indicates the subsidiary and ornamental light in which the assent of the parishioners was now to be regarded. The church could have given more weight to the wishes of the people; she professed to regard patronage as a grievance, and the annual instructions of the assembly to the commission (the committee representing the assembly till its next meeting) enjoined that body to take advantage of any opportunity which might arise for getting rid of the grievance of patronage, an injunction which was not discontinued till 1784. It is not likely that any change in the law could have been obtained at this period, and disregard of the law might have led to an exhausting struggle with the state, as was actually the case at a later period. Still it was in the power of the church to give more weight than she did to the feelings of the people; and her working of the patronage system drove large numbers from the Establishment. A melancholy catalogue of forced settlements marks the annals of the church from 1749 to 1780, and wherever an unpopular presentee was settled the people quietly left the Establishment and erected a meeting-house. In 1763 there was a great debate in the assembly on the progress of schism, in which the popular party laid the whole blame at the door of the Moderates, while the Moderates rejoined that patronage and Moderatism had made the church the dignified and powerful institution she had come to be. In 1764 the number of meeting-houses was 120, and in 1773 it had risen to 190. Nor was a conciliatory attitude taken up towards the seceders. The ministers of the Relief desired to remain connected with the Establishment, but were not suffered to do so. Those ministers who resigned their parishes to accept calls to Relief congregations, in places where forced settlements had taken place, and who might have been and claimed to be recognized as still ministers of the church, were deposed and forbidden to look for any ministerial communion with the clergy of the Establishment. Such was the policy of the Moderate ascendency, or of Principal Robertson’s administration, on this vital subject. It had the merit of success in so far as it completely established itself in the church. The presbyteries ceased to disregard presentations, and lay patronage came to be regarded as part of the order of things. But the growth of dissent steadily continued and excited alarm from time to time; and it may be questioned whether the peace of the church was not purchased at too high a price. The Moderate period is justly regarded as in some respects the most brilliant in the history of the church. Her clergy included many distinguished Scotsmen, of whom an account is given under their respective names. See Reid (Thomas), Campbell (George), Ferguson (Adam), Home (John), Blair (Hugh), Robertson (William), and Erskine (John). The labours of these men were not mainly in theology; in religion the age was one not of advance but of rest; they gained for the church a great and widespread respect and influence.

Another salient feature of the Moderate policy was the consolidation of discipline. It is frequently asserted that discipline was lax at this period and that ministers of scandalous lives were allowed to continue in their charges. It cannot, however, be shown that the leaders of the church at this time sought to procure the miscarriage of justice in dealing with such cases. That some offenders were acquitted on technical grounds is true; it was insisted that in dealing with the character and status of their members the church courts should proceed in as formal and punctilious a manner as civil tribunals and should recognize the same laws of evidence, in fact, that the same securities should exist in the church as in the state for individual rights and liberties.

The religious state of the Highlands, to which at the period of the Union the Reformation had only very partially penetrated, occupied the attention of the church during the whole of the 18th century. In 1725 the gift called the “royal bounty” was first granted,—a subsidy amounting at first to £1000 per annum, increased in George IV.'s reign to £2000, and continued to the present day; its original object was to assist the reclamation of the Highlands from Roman Catholicism by means of catechists and teachers. The Society for Propagating Christian Knowledge, incorporated in 1709, with a view partly to the wants of the Highlands, worked in concert with the Church of Scotland, setting up schools in remote and destitute localities, while the church promoted various schemes for the dissemination of the Scriptures in Gaelic and the encouragement of Gaelic students. In consequence of these efforts Roman Catholicism now lingers only in a few islands and glens on the west coast. In these labours as well as in other directions the church was sadly hampered by poverty. The need of an increase in the number of parishes was urgently felt, and, though chapels began to be built about 1796, they were provided only in wealthy places by local voluntary liberality; for the supply of the necessities of poor outlying districts no one as yet looked to any agency but the state. In every part of the country many of the ministers were miserably poor; there were many stipends, even of important parishes, not exceeding £40 a year; and it was not till after many debates in the assembly and appeals to the Government that an Act was obtained in 1810 which made up the poorer livings to £150 a year by a grant from the public exchequer. The churches and manses were frequently of the most misera ole description, if not falling to decay.

With the close of the 18th century a great change passed over the spirit of the church. The new activity which sprang up everywhere after the French Revolution produced in Scotland a revival of Evangelicalism which has not yet spent its force. Moderatism had cultivated the ministers too fast for the people, and the church had become to a large extent more of a dignified ruler than a spiritual mother. About this time the brothers Robert and James Haldane devoted themselves to the work of promoting Evangelical Christianity, James making missionary journeys throughout Scotland and founding Sunday schools; and in 1798 the eccentric preacher Rowland Hill visited Scotland at their request. In the journals of these evangelists dark pictures are drawn of the religious state of the country, though their censorious tone detracts greatly from their value; but there is no doubt that the efforts of the Haldanes brought about or coincided with a quickening of the religious spirit of Scotland. The assembly of 1799 passed an Act forbidding the admission to the pulpits of laymen or of ministers of other churches, and issued a manifesto on Sunday schools. These Acts helped greatly to discredit the Moderate party, of whose spirit they were the outcome; and that party further injured their standing in the country by attacking Leslie, afterwards Sir John Leslie, on frivolous grounds,—a phrase he had used about Hume’s view of causation—when he applied for the chair of mathematics in Edinburgh. In this dispute, which made a great sensation in the country, the popular party successfully defended Leslie, and thus obtained the sympathy of[9:21:538] the enlightened portion of the community. In 1810 the Christian Instructor began to appear under the editorship of Dr Andrew Thomson, a churchman of vigorous intellect and noble character. It was an ably written review, in which the theology of the Haldanes asserted itself in a somewhat dogmatic and confident tone against all unsoundness and Moderatism, clearly proclaiming that the former things had passed away. The question of pluralities began to be agitated in 1813, and gave rise to a long struggle, in which Dr Chalmers took a notable part, and which terminated in the regulation that a university chair or principalship should not be held along with a parish which was not close to the university seat.

The growth of Evangelical sentiment in the church, along with the example of the great missionary societies founded in the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th century, led to the institution of the various missionary schemes still carried on, and their history forms the chief part of the history of the church for a number of years. The education scheme, having for its object the planting of schools in destitute Highland districts, came into existence in 1824. The foreign mission committee was formed in 1825, at the instance of Dr Inglis, a leader of the Moderate party; and Dr Duff went to India in 1829 as the first missionary of the Church of Scotland. The church extension committee was first appointed in 1828, and in 1834 it was made permanent. The colonial scheme was inaugurated in 1836, and the Jewish mission in 1838, M'Cheyne and Andrew Bonar setting out in the following year as a deputation to inquire into the condition of the Jews in Palestine and Turkey and on the Continent of Europe. Of these schemes that of church extension has most historical importance. It was originally formed to collect information regarding the spiritual wants of the country, and to apply to the Government to build the churches found to be necessary. As the population of Scotland had doubled since the Reformation, and its distribution had been completely altered in many counties, while the number of parish churches remained unchanged, and meeting-houses had only been erected where seceding congregations required them, the need for new churches was very great. The application to Government for aid, however, proved the occasion of a “Voluntary controversy,” which raged with great fierceness for many years and has never completely subsided. The union of the Burgher and the Antiburgher bodies in 1820 in the United Secession—both having previously come to hold Voluntary principles— added to the influence of these principles in the country, while the political excitement of the period disposed men’s minds to such discussions. The Government built forty-two churches in the Highlands, providing them with a slender endowment; and these are still known as parliamentary churches. Under Dr Chalmers, however, the church extension committee struck out a new line of action. That great philanthropist had come to see that the church could only reach the masses of the people effectively by greatly increasing the number of her places of worship and abolishing or minimizing seat-rents in the poorer districts. In his powerful defence of establishments against the voluntaries in both Scotland and England, in which his ablest assistants were those who afterwards became, along with him, the leaders of the Free Church, he pleaded that an established church to be effective must divide the country territorially into a large number of small parishes, so that every corner of the land and every person,’of whatever class, shall actually enjoy the benefits of the parochial machinery. This “territorial principle” the church has steadily kept in view ever since. With the view of realizing this idea he appealed to the church to provide funds to build a large number of new churches, and personally carried his appeal throughout the country. By 1835 he had collected £65,626 and reported the building of sixty-two churches in connexion with the Establishment. The keenness of the conflict as it approached the crisis of 1843 checked the liberality of the people for this object, but by 1841 £305,747 had been collected and 222 churches built.

The zealous orthodoxy of the church found at this period several occasions to assert itself. M'Leod Campbell, minister of Row, was deposed by the assembly of 1830 for teaching that assurance is of the essence of faith and that Christ died for all men. He has since been recognized as one of the profoundest Scottish theologians of the 19th century, although his deposition has never been removed. The same assembly condemned the doctrine put forth by Edward Irving, that Christ took upon Him the sinful nature of man and was not impeccable, and Irving was deposed five years later by the presbytery of Annan, when the outburst of supposed miraculous gifts in his church in London had rendered him still more obnoxious to the strict censures of the period. In 1841 Wright of Borthwick was deposed for a series of heretical opinions, which he denied that he held, but which were said to be contained in a series of devotional works of a somewhat mystical order which he had published.

The influence of dissent also acted along with the rapidly rising religious fervour of the age in quickening in the church that sense of a divine mission, and of the right and power to carry out that mission without obstruction from any worldly authority, which belongs to the essential consciousness of the Christian church. An agitation against patronage, the ancient root of evil, and the formation of an anti-patronage society, helped in the same direction. The Ten Years’ Conflict, which began in 1833 with the passing by the assembly of the Veto and the Chapel Acts, is treated in the article Free Church of Scotland. It is not therefore necessary to dwell further in this place on the consequences of those Acts. The assembly of 1843, from which the exodus took place, proceeded to undo the Acts of the church during the preceding nine years. The Veto was not repealed but ignored, as having never had the force of law; the Strathbogie ministers were recognized as if no sentence of deposition had gone forth against them. The protest which the moderator had read before leaving the assembly had been left on the table; and an Act of Separation and deed of demission were received from the ministers of the newly formed Free Church, who were now declared to have severed their connexion with the Church of Scotland. The assembly addressed a pastoral letter to the people of the country, in which, while declining to “admit that the course taken by the seceders was justified by irresistible necessity,” they counselled peace and goodwill towards them, and called for the loyal support of the remaining members of the church.

Two Acts at once passed through the legislature in answer to the claims put forward by the church. The Scottish Benefices Act of Lord Aberdeen, 1843, gave the people power to state objections personal to a presentee, and bearing on his fitness for the particular charge to which he was presented, and also authorized the presbytery in dealing with the objections to look to the number and character of the objectors. Sir James Graham’s Act, 1844, provided for the erection of new parishes, and thus created the legal basis for a scheme under which chapel ministers might become members of church courts.

The Disruption left the Church of Scotland in a sadly maimed condition. Of 1203 ministers 451 left her, and among these were many of her foremost men. A third of her membership is computed to have gone with them. In Edinburgh many of her churches were nearly empty. The Gaelic-speaking population of the northern counties com-[9:21:539] pletely deserted her. All her missionaries left her but one. She had no gale of popular enthusiasm to carry her forward, representing as she did not a newly arisen principle but the opposition to a principle which she maintained to be dangerous and exaggerated. For many years she had much obloquy to endure. But she at once set herself to the task of filling up vacancies and recruiting the missionary staff. A lay association was formed, which raised large sums of money for the missionary schemes, so that their income was not allowed seriously to decline. The good works of the church, indeed, were in a few years not only continued but extended. All hope being lost that parliament would endow the new churches built by the church extension scheme of Dr Chalmers, it was felt that this also must be the work of voluntary liberality. Under Dr James Robertson, professor of church history in Edinburgh, one of the leading champions of the Moderate policy in the Ten Years’ Conflict, the extension scheme was transformed into the endowment scheme, and the church accepted it as her duty and her task to provide the machinery of new parishes where they were required. By 1854 30 new parishes had been added at a cost of £130,000, and from this time forward the work of endowment proceeded still more rapidly. In 1860 61 new parishes had been endowed, in 1870 150, in 1876 250, while in 1886 there were 351.^[1. Those branches of the church extension scheme which dealt with church building, and with the opening of new missions to meet the wants of increasing populations, were taken up by a new department, called the home mission scheme. The home mission as the pioneer in opening up new fields of labour, and the endowment scheme which renders permanent the religious centres that the mission has founded, are both traceable to Dr Chalmers. ] In 1843 the number of parishes was 924. Of 42 parliamentary churches existing at that time 40 have been erected into parishes quoad sacra ; hence the total number of parishes in Scotland at midsummer 1886 was 1315. By the Poor Law Act of 1845 parishes were enabled to remove the care of the poor from the minister and the kirk-session, in whom it was formerly vested, and to appoint a parochial board with power to assess the ratepayers. The Education Act of 1872 severed the ancient tie connecting church and school together, and created a school board having charge of the education of each parish. At that date the Church of Scotland had 300 schools, mostly in the Highlands. The church, however, continues to carry on normal schools for the training of teachers in Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.

In 1874 patronage was abolished. The working of Lord Aberdeen’s Act had given rise to many unedifying scenes and to lengthy struggles over disputed settlements, and it was early felt that some change at least was necessary in the law. The agitation on the subject went on in the assembly from 1857 to 1869, when the assembly by a large majority condemned patronage as restored by the Act of Queen Anne, and resolved to petition parliament for its removal. The request was granted, and the right of electing parish ministers was conferred on the congregation; thus a grievance of old standing, from which all the ecclesiastical troubles of a century and a half had sprung, was removed and the church placed on a thoroughly democratic basis. This Act, combined with various efforts made within the church for her improvement, has secured for the Scottish Establishment a large measure of popular favour, and during the last quarter of a century she has grown rapidly both in numbers and in influence. This revival is largely due on the one hand to the improvement of her worship which began with the efforts of Dr Robert Lee (1804-1868), minister of Old Greyfriars, Edinburgh, and professor of Biblical criticism in Edinburgh university. By introducing into his church a printed book of prayers and also an organ Dr Lee stirred up vehement controversies in the church courts, which resulted in the recognition of the liberty of congregations to improve their worship. A church service society, having for its object the study of ancient and modern liturgies, with a view to the preparation of forms of prayer for public worship, was founded in 1865; it has published five editions of its “Book of Common Order,” which, though at first regarded with suspicion, is now recognized as a useful and respected adjunct. Church music has been cultivated and improved in a marked degree; a fine collection of hymns has been introduced to supplement the psalms and paraphrases. And architecture has restored the larger churches from their disfigurement by partition walls and galleries— though much still remains to be done in this way—and has erected new churches of a style favourable to devotion.

The fervour of the church has, on the other hand, found a channel in the operations of a “Committee on Christian Life and Work,” appointed in 1869 with the aim of exercising some supervision of the work of the church throughout the country, stimulating evangelistic efforts, and organizing the labours of lay agents. This committee publishes a magazine of “Life and Work,” which has a circulation of about 100,000, and has lately been seeking to organize young men’s guilds in connexion with congregations. It was to reinforce this element of the church’s activity, as well as to strengthen her generally, that Mr James Baird in 1873 made the munificent gift of £500,000. This fund is administered by a trust which is not under the control of the church, and the revenue is used mainly in aid of church building and endowment throughout the country.

The church has greatly increased of late years in liberality of sentiment, and there has been no deposition for heresy since 1843. A volume of Scotch Sermons published in 1880 by ministers holding liberal views brought out the fact that the church would not willingly be led into such prosecutions. An agitation on the part of the Dissenters for disestablishment sprang up afresh after the passing of the Patronage Act and has continued ever since; while a counter-movement was represented by a Bill, introduced into parliament in 1886 to declare the spiritual independence of the Church of Scotland, which, if successful, would, it was understood, have opened the way for a reunion of the Presbyterian bodies.^[2. For the period since 1843 the most useful book is Dr Story's Life of Dr Robert Lee, 1870. ] Church Membership.— The Church of Scotland has now (1886) 1315 parishes, 160 non-parochial churches, and 121 preaching and mission stations, in all 1596 charges. The number of presbyteries is 84, and there are 16 provincial synods. The general assembly consists of 252 clerical and 118 lay members elected by presbyteries, with 73 representatives of royal burghs and universities, and 4 representatives of churches abroad, in all 447 members. In 1873 the number of communicants as returned to parliament in 1874 was 460,526; in 1878 the number as returned to parliament in 1879 was 515,786; in 1883 the number returned to the assembly of 1884 was 543,969; in 1885, 564,435. The professors of divinity at the four Scottish universities must be ministers of the church, and students aspiring to the ministry are required to attend one of the divinity halls of the universities for three sessions, after an arts course of three years. A large number of ministers of the church are employed elsewhere than in Scotland. The Church of Scotland in England consists of 16 charges. There are 31 chaplains ministering to Presbyterians in the army and navy, 15 of these being stationed in India. The foreign mission employs 15 ordained and 11 unordained European missionaries, with a large number of native agents, in India, East Africa, and China. The Jewish mission employs 6 ordained ministers, with other agents, at Constantinople, Smyrna, Salonica, Beyrout, and Alexandria. The colonial committee supplies religious ordinances to emigrants from Scotland in India, Fiji, Cyprus, Mauritius, Ceylon, and the West Indies, besides assisting Presbyterian colleges in Canada and Australia. A minister of the church presides over a Scots church of old standing at Amsterdam. Two lectureships have been founded in recent times in connexion with the church—one by Mr James Baird (already mentioned),[9:21:540] the other by Mr John Croall of Southfield—and these have already produced several notable contributions to Scottish theology.

An association for augumenting the smaller livings was formed in 1866, and the church now has a smaller livings scheme, which aims at bringing up to £200 a year all livings that fall below that sum. Such numbered 311 in 1885; and the sum distributed among them was £8537, which, however, was £5000 short of the sum necessary to accomplish fully the desired object.

In the following details of the income of the church we give first the value of her endowments and then some figures showing the growth of her voluntary liberality.

Means from Endowments.— (1) From a parliamentary return obtained in 1874 the church is seen to derive from teinds, including the value of manses and glebes, the annual sum of £289,413. Augmentations have been obtained since that date amounting to upwards of £10,000, but the fiars prices have declined during the same period by nearly 25 per cent., so that the total amount so derived has not increased. The unexhausted teinds amounted in 1880 to £134,413. (2) The exchequer pays to 190 poor parishes and to 42 Highland churches, from church property in the hands of the crown, £17,040. (3) From local sources the church derives

£23,501. (4) The endowments raised by the church for 342 new parishes amount to £42,500. The total endowments, not counting church buildings, amount to £383,041.

Means from Voluntary Liberality.— The following table (I.) gives a view of the financial progress of certain of the schemes of the church since the secession :—
[table]

No attempt was made until 1873 to collect statistics of the whole liberality of the church; and changes introduced from time to time in the mode of stating the various sums make it impossible to give a complete comparative statement since that date. The following table (II.) shows the amount at quinquennial periods down to 1885, the church-door collections and seat-rents probably affording the most accurate indication of the general progress of the body. The building operations of which the values are given include only such building as is the result of voluntary effort. Under the head of “general church objects" are included the collections for missions, for small livings, aged and infirm ministers, zenana missions, &c. These figures do not include income from trust funds or endowments; they state what was given in the year referred to. A number of objects of liberality are not included in the table.
[table]

The following sums were raised during the thirteen years 1872- 84 :—congregational and charitable purposes, £1,462,091; support of ordinances and supplement of stipends, £233,406; education (exclusive of sums raised for training colleges), £161,931; home mission work, £358,543; church building, £737,775; endowment of new parishes, £486,693; foreign mission work, £376,523; total, £3,816,962. Mr James Baird’s gift is not included in this statement. (A. M*.)
