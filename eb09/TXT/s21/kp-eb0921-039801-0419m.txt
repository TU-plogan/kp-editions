SCHINKEL, Karl Friedrich (1781-1841), architect and painter, and professor in the academy of fine arts at Berlin from 1820, was born at Neuruppin, in Brandenburg, on March 13, 1781, and died at Berlin, on October 9, 1841. He is esteemed one of the most original of modern German architects. His principal buildings are in Berlin (q.v.) and its neighbourhood. They include the Bauakademie, which contains a museum of his designs. His Sammlung architektonischer Entwürfe (1820-1837; 3d ed. 1857-58) and Werke der höheren Baukunst (1845-6; new ed. 1874) exemplify his style.
