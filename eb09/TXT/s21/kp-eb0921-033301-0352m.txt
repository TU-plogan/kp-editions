SAVONA, a city of Italy, in the province of Genoa, 25½ miles west of that town, and 91 miles south of Turin by rail, is after Genoa and Nice the most important of the cities of the Riviera. The greater part of the town is now modern, consisting of handsome gardens, boulevards, and well-paved broad streets lined with massive arcades and substantial houses, built in enormous square blocks from four to five stories high. It is surrounded with green-clad hills and luxuriant orange groves. On the Rock of St George stands the castle built by the Genoese in 1542, now used as a military prison. The cathedral (1589-1604) is a late Renaissance building with a dome of modern construction. In the Cappella Sistina stands the magnificent tomb erected by Sixtus IV. to his parents. Facing the cathedral is the Della Rovere palace erected by Cardinal Giulio della Rovere (Julius II.) as a kind of university, and now occupied by the prefecture, the post-office, and the courts. San Domenico (or Giovanni Battista) built by the Dominicans, occupies the site of the very ancient church of Sant’ Antonio Abate. Several of the churches have paintings of some merit, and there is a municipal picture-gallery occupying part of the extensive buildings of the civil hospital of St Paul. The Teatro Chiabrera, erected in 1853 in honour of the lyric poet Chiabrera, who was born in Savona, and is buried there in the church of San Giacomo, has its façade adorned with statues of Alfieri, Goldoni, Metastasio, and Rossini. The town-house (with the public library founded by the bishop of Savona, Maria di Mari, in 1840), the episcopal palace, and the harbour tower surmounted by a colossal figure of the Virgin also deserve mention. As early as the 12th century, the Savonese built themselves a sufficient harbour; but in the 16th century their rivals the Genoese, fearing that Francis I. of France intended to make it a great seat of Mediterranean trade, rendered it useless by sinking at its mouth vessels filled with large stones. The modern harbour, dating from 1815, has since 1880 been provided with a dock excavated in the rock, 986 feet long 460 wide and 23 feet deep; and other extensions are in progress. In 1884 1012 vessels (349,462 tons) entered and 988 (346,337 tons) cleared—the steamers being respectively 298 (273,237 tons) and 294 (270,953). The opening of the railway to Bra (1878) at once gave Savona an advantage over Genoa as a port for supplying Turin and Piedmont. A large import trade has since grown up, especially in coals (300,000 tons from Great Britain and France), which can be loaded directly from the ship into the trucks. The exports are confined to the products of the local industries, fruit, hoop-staves, Ac. The potteries which have been long established at Savona export their earthenware to all parts of Italy; and there are glass-

works, soap-works, and one of the largest iron-foundries in North Italy. Shipbuilding is also carried on. The population of the commune, which includes the suburbs of Fornaci, Lavagnola, Legino and Zinola, and San Bernardo, was 19,611 in 1861 and 29,614 in 1881, that of the city at the latter date being 19,120.

Savona is the Savo where, according to Livy, Mago stored his booty in the Second Punic War. In 1191 it bought up the territorial claims of the Marquises Del Carretto. lts whole history is that of a long struggle against the preponderance of Genoa. In 1746 it was captured by the king of Sardinia, but it was restored to Genoa by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Columbus, whose ancestors came from Savona, gave the name of the city to one of the first islands ho discovered in the West Indies.
