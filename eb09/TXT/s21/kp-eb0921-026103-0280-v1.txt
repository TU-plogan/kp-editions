SANDWICH, an English borough, market-town, and Cinque Port, is situated in the east of Kent, opposite the Downs, on a branch of the South-Eastern Railway, and on the Stour, 2 miles from the sea, 12 miles east of Canterbury, and 4 north-west of Deal. The streets are narrow and the houses irregularly built. The old line of the walls on the land side is marked by a public walk. The Fishers’ Cate and a gateway called the Barbican are interesting; but the four principal gates were pulled down in the last century. St Clement’s church has a fine Norman central tower, and St Peter’s, said to date from the reign of King John, has interesting mediaeval monuments. The grammar school founded by Sir Roger Manwood in 1564 is now in abeyance. There are three ancient hospitals; St Bartholomew’s has a fine Early English chapel of the 12th century. Until the beginning of the 16th century Sandwich was of considerable importance as a port, but after the filling up of the harbour with sand about the beginning of the 16th century it fell into decay. The principal industries of the town are market-gardening, tanning, wool-sorting, and brewing. Coal, timber, and iron are imported. Sandwich returned two members to parliament till 1880, and was merged in the St Augustine’s division of the county in 1885. The parliamentary borough, which included Deal and Walmer (area 2684 acres), had in 1881 a population of 15,655, while that of the municipal borough (area 706 acres) was 2846.

In the Norman survey Sandwich is described as a borough. It rose into importance on the decline of the Portus Rutupensis, its name denoting the situation on the sands. The Danes frequently attacked it in the 10th and 11th centuries; and it was repeatedly plundered by the French in the 15th century. It was fortified by Edward VI. Sandwich was incorporated by Edward the Confessor, and received its last charter from Charles II.
