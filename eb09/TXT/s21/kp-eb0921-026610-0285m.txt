SANKT PÃ–LTEN, a small town, and the seat of a bishop, in Lower Austria, is situated on the Treisen, a tributary of the Danube, 61 miles west of Vienna by rail. It contains an interesting old abbey church, founded in 1030 and restored in 1266 and again at the beginning of the 18th century. There are several religious educational institutions in the town, and a military academy for engineers. The inhabitants, 10,015 in number, carry on some trade, and the manufacture of iron wire, paper, weapons, &c. The name is said to be a corruption of Traisma ad S. Hippolytum, from a convent that formerly stood here. The history of the bishopric has been written in two volumes by Kerschbaumer (Vienna, 1875-6).
