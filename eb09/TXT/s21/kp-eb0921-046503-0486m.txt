SCILLY ISLES, a group of islands, about forty in number, in the county of Cornwall (see vol. vi. plate IX.), England, are situated about 25 miles west by south of Land’s End and 40 west from Lizard Point, in 50° N. lat. and 6° W. long. They are composed wholly of granite,— outliers of the granite highlands of Cornwall. There are some metalliferous veins or lodes, but none that could ever have yielded much iron. On account of the mild climate the vegetation is remarkably luxuriant. The mean average temperature in winter is about 45° and in summer about 58°. Fuchsias, geraniums, and myrtles attain an immense size, and aloes, cactus, and the prickly pear grow in the open air. The inhabitants devote their attention principally to the cultivation of early potatoes for the London market. Asparagus and other early vegetables, as well as flowers, are also largely cultivated. Lobsters are caught and sent to London, but the fishing industry is of comparatively minor importance.

The total area of the islands is 3560 acres, with a population in 1871 of 2090, and in 1881 of 2320, including 276 persons on board vessels. The inhabited islands are St Mary’s (area about 1500 acres), Tresco (700), St Martin’s (550), St Agnes (350), and Bryher (300). The principal town, Hugh Town in St Mary’s, occupies a sandy peninsula crowned by the height called the Garrison, with Star Castle, erected in the time of Elizabeth. It possesses a harbour and pier with a roadstead affording anchorage for large vessels. The coast-line is wild and picturesque, with precipitous headlands and many extensive caves. On Tresco there are remains of an abbey; and St Agnes has a lighthouse 72 feet in height. On the islands there are numerous rude pillars and circles of stones, similar to those in Cornwall.

The Scilly Isles are probably the Cassiterides or “Tin Islands” of the Greeks (see vol. xviii. p. 806). The islands were granted in 936 by Athelstan to the monks settled at Tresco, but on the endowment of the abbey of Tavistock the greater portion of them were included amongst its possessions. In the reign of Elizabeth they were divided amongst several proprietors. During the Civil War Hugh Town held out for the king, and in 1645 afforded shelter for a time to Prince Charles until he escaped to Jersey. In 1649 they were taken possession of by Sir John Grenville, a Royalist, who made use of them as a convenient shelter, whence he issued to sweep the neighbouring seas, until in 1651 he was forced to surrender to a fleet under Blake and Sir John Ayscue. In ancient times a frequent haunt of pirates, the islands were afterwards notorious for smuggling. On the suppression of smuggling Mr Augustus J. Smith did much to introduce order and encourage habits of industry amongst the inhabitants.
