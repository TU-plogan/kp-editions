SACRAMENT. The Latin word sacramentum, meaning “an oath,” is most commonly used by classical writers to denote the military oath of allegiance; for its technical application in legal phraseology see Roman Law, vol. xx. p. 682. In the earliest ecclesiastical Latin traces of the old military meaning are still present; thus Tertullian (Ad Mart., 3) writes, “We were called to the warfare of the living God in our very response to the sacramental words [in baptism] ”; but the main import of the word has entirely changed, it being used simply as the equivalent of the Greek μυστήριον . Thus even in the Vulgate we still have the “sacrament of godliness” (1 Tim. iii. 16), “of the seven stars” (Rev. i. 20), “of the woman and the beast” (Rev. xvii. 7); but in earlier Latin versions the word also occurred in numerous other places where “mysterium” is now found (e.g., Rom. xvi. 25; 1 Cor. xiii. 2). In addition to its general sense the word μυστηριον not unnaturally soon came to have for Christians a more special meaning as denoting those external rites of their religion, solemn, instructive, and more or less secret, which had most analogy with the MYSTERIES (q.v.) of paganism. No attempt, however, was at first made to enumerate or to define these. Tertullian speaks of the sacrament of baptism and the Eucharist, Cyprian of “either sacrament,” meaning baptism and confirmation, and many others, following Eph. v. 22 (see Vulgate), of the sacrament of marriage, but all with the utmost vagueness. Augustine’s definition of the word was little more explicit, but for centuries it was all the Western Church had, and for even a longer period it continued to be a sufficiently adequate expression of the Oriental view also. According to him a sacrament is “the visible form of invisible grace,” or “a sign of a sacred thing.” The sacraments he principally has in view are those of baptism and the Lord’s Supper, but 'with so wide a definition there was nothing to prevent him from using the word (as he freely does) in many other applications. The old Sacramentaries or liturgical books, which can in some cases be carried back as far as to the 8th century, in like manner contain prayers and benedictions, not only for the administration of the Eucharist and of baptism, but also for a variety of other rites, such as the blessing of holy water and the dedication of churches. In the De socramentis Christianae fidei of Hugh of St[9:21:132] Victor (d. 1141), no fewer than thirty sacraments are enumerated, divided into three classes, baptism and the Lord’s Supper occupying a first place. What proved to be an important new departure was taken by Peter Lombard (d. 1164), in the 4th book of his Sentences, which treats “of sacraments and sacramental signs.” There for the first time are enumerated the seven sacraments (baptism, confirmation, the Eucharist, penance, extreme unction, order, matrimony), which were afterwards formally recognized by the Church of Rome at the councils of Florence (1439) and of Trent; and there also for the first time it was expressly recognized that not all signs of sacred things can be regarded as sacraments, but only those which are the form of invisible grace in such a sense as to represent it and bring it about (“ut ipsius imaginent gerat et causa existat”). This “differentia” of the sacrament, properly so called, became the basis of all subsequent scholastic discussion and authoritative decree in the Western church, and even, though of course indirectly, in the Eastern also. The main points in the Tridentine doctrine are these: the sacraments have the power of conferring grace ex opere operato on the recipients who do not resist it (“non ponentibus obicem”); for their validity, however, there must be in the minister the intention of doing that which the church does. Though all are in a sense necessary, they are not so with equal directness for each individual, nor are they alike in dignity. The two principal sacraments are baptism and the Lord’s Supper. All were instituted by Christ. Three of them (baptism, confirmation, order) impart an indelible “character,” and therefore cannot be repeated. For the teaching of the Greek Church compare vol. xi. pp. 158, 159. Tho churches of the Reformation, while retaining the current doctrine that sacraments were “effectual signs of grace and God’s good will” “ordained by Christ,” reduced their number to two, the remaining five being excluded partly because direct evidence of their institution by Christ was wanting, and partly because “they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.” For further details on the individual sacraments the reader is referred to the separate articles (Baptism, Eucharist, &c.).
