SERAMPUR, a town of British India, in Hugli(Hooghly) district, Bengal, situated on the right bank of the Hugli river, 13 miles by rail north of Calcutta, in 22° 45' 26'' N. lat. and 88° 23' 10" E. long. It was formerly a Danish settlement, and remained so until 1845, when all the Danish possessions in India were ceded by treaty to the East India Company. Serampur is famed as the residence of a body of Protestant Baptist missionaries, who made it the centre of their Christianizing efforts. At the census of 1881 the population of the town was 25,559 (13,137 males and 12,422 females).
