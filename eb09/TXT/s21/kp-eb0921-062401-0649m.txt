SEINE, the department of France which has Paris as its chief town, was formed in 1790 of part of the province of Île-de-France. It lies between 48° 44' and 48° 58' N. lat. and 2° 10' and 2° 34' E. long. and is entirely surrounded by the department of Seine-et-Oise, from which it is separated at certain parts by the Seine, the Marne, and the Bièvre. The area of the department is only 118,306

acres, and of this surface a seventh or a sixth is occupied by Paris; the suburban villages also are close together and very populous. In actual population (2,799,329 in 1881) as well as in density (23·7 persons per acre) it holds the first place. Flowing from south-east to north-west through the department, the Seine forms three links: on the right it receives above Paris the Marne, and below Paris the Rouillon, and on the left hand the Bièvre within the precincts of the city. The left bank of the Seine is in general higher than the right and consists of the Villejuif and Chatillon plateaus separated by the Bièvre; the highest point (568 feet) is above Chatillon and the lowest (105) at the exit of the Seine. Below Paris the river flows between the plain of Gennevilliers and Nanterre (commanded by Mont Valérien) on the left and the plain of St Denis on the right. On the right side, to the east of Paris, are the heights of Avron and Vincennes commanding the course of the Marne. Communication is further facilitated by various canals (see Paris).

Market gardens occupy about 3700 acres within and without the city, and by means of irrigation and manuring are made to yield from ten to eleven crops per annum (see Paris). Some districts are specially celebrated,—Montreuil for its peaches, Fontenay-aux-Roses for its strawberries and roses, and other places for flowers and nurseries. The department produced in 1883 326,326 bushels of wheat, 4042 of meslin, 75,003 of rye, 3415 of barley, 337,837 of oats, 1,656,009 of potatoes, 14,650 of pulse, and 15,400 tons of beetroot. Altogether, 60,000 persons are engaged in agriculture. The live stock in 1881 comprised 95,796 horses (70,296 in Paris), 4174 cattle, 280 calves, 8159 sheep, 3626 pigs, and 660 goats. Vineyards, producing 366,748 gallons of wine annually, cover 2460 acres. The principal woods (Boulogne and Vincennes) belong to Paris. It is partly owing to the number of quarries in the district that Paris owes its origin: Chatillon and Montrouge in the south yield freestone, and Bagneux and Clamait in the south and Montreuil and Romainville in the east possess the richest plaster quarries in France. Within the circuit of Paris are certain old quarries now forming the catacombs. Most of the industrial establishments in the department are situated in Paris or at St Denis. Pantin (17,857 inhabitants in 1881) on the Ourcq Canal is the seat of a national factory of tobacco, and also of glass-works, and Aubervilliers (19,437) on the St Denis Canal is the seat of great chemical works. Along the Seine, below Paris, Boulogne (25,615) is partly occupied by laundry establishments; Puteaux (15,586) manufactures woollen goods, and has dyeworks, printing works, cloth-dressing works, and engineering works of considerable importance; Clichy (24,320) manufactures crystal and has a large gaswork, &c. Above Paris, Ivry (18,442) has iron-works and engineering works; Choisy-le-Roi (6978) has factories for the making of porcelain, glass, soda, chemicals, morocco, and waxcloth; Montreuil (18,693), near Vincennes, makes patent leather, porcelain, &c. The department is of course traversed by all the railway lines which converge in Paris, and also contains the inner circuit railway and part of the outer circuit,—making a total of 122 miles of railway, to which are to be added numerous tramways, 72 miles of national roads, and 458 of other roads. There are 3 arrondissements (Paris, St Denis, and Sceaux), 28 cantons (20 in Paris), and 72 communes. The department forms the archiepiscopal diocese of Paris, falls within the jurisdiction of the Paris court of appeal, and is divided between the four corps d’armée of Amiens, Rouen, Le Mans, and Orleans. Among the important institutions in the department are the lyceums of Vanves and Sceaux, the lunatic asylum at Charenton, the veterinary college of Maisons-Alfort, and the great Bicêtre hospital at Gentilly.
