SAUSSURE, Horace Benedict de (1740-1799), one of Switzerland’s most celebrated physicists, was born in Geneva on February 17, 1740.^[1. His father, Nicolas de Saussure (1709-90), an agriculturist of unusually liberal opinions and wide sympathies, when a young man had applied himself to literary pursuits, and especially to the study of writings bearing on farming. He resided all his life at his farm of Conches, on the Arve, near Geneva. As a member of the council of Two Hundred he took part in public affairs. Most of his writings were of a practical character, bearing on the growth and diseases of grain and other farm produce. His last work, On Fire, the Principle of Fecundity in Plants and of Fertility in the Earth, published in 1782, was more speculative in its nature. ] His youth was passed at his father’s farm, where he early acquired a love for the study of nature. Following the example of his father and of his uncle Charles Bonnet, with whom he was associated in a research on the leaves of plants, he devoted himself at first to botany. Thus he was led to make the acquaintance of Haller, who was not long in discerning and appreciating his rare powers as an observer. In 1762, when only twenty-two years of age, Saussure was elected to the chair of philosophy at Geneva, where, along with another professor, he taught logic and physics alternately. But his natural leanings were all towards the study of external nature; and he took advantage of all available opportunities of travelling to thoroughly explore the mountains, valleys, and lakes of his native land, and to visit those of foreign countries, with the view of widening and deepening his conception of the constitution of the world. The Society of Arts of Geneva was founded by Saussure in 1772, and in 1774, at the invitation of the Government, he elaborated a plan for the reform of the system of teaching in his native town; but this was too radical in its nature to be adopted. In 1786 he resigned his professorship to his friend and fellow-worker Pictet. While honouring his country by his devotion to laborious scientific investigations, he exhibited his patriotism by[9:21:324] untiring diligence in the exercise of his duties as a member of the council of Two Hundred, and afterwards of the National Assembly. In consequence of over-exertion in this work his health began to fail in 1794; but, although deprived of the use of his limbs, he continued to revise the concluding volumes of his great work on Alpine physiography, which were published in 1796. Latterly his mind became enfeebled, and when he was offered a chair of philosophy by the French Government in 1798 he had lapsed into a condition of partial imbecility. He died on January 22, 1799, at the age of fifty-nine, leaving two sons and a daughter.

The Alps formed the centre of Saussure’s investigations. They forced themselves on his attention as the grand key to the true theory of the earth; but, as year by year his mass of facts assumed ever-growing dimensions, his generalizations became more guarded, until finally he came to consider a simple recording of observations as the only justifiable course. As a young man he had roamed in search of plants through many remote valleys and over the “montagnes maudits” as his unappreciative fellow-dwellers by the lakes called the snow-capped summits around them. It had been his dream, he says, since he was twenty to ascend Mont Blanc; and he accomplished the feat on 3d August 1787. This was the second time that the ascent of that mountain, until then deemed inaccessible, was made in that year.

Saussure found among the Alps opportunity for studying geology in a manner never previously attempted. The inclination of the strata, the nature of the rocks, the fossils, and the minerals received his closest attention. He acquired a thorough knowledge of the chemistry of the day, watching for the brilliant series of discoveries and the improvements in processes of analysis that brought the science into such dazzling prominence during the last quarter of the eighteenth century; and he applied all to the study of minerals, water, and air. Saussure’s geological observations made him a firm believer in the Neptunian theory: he regarded all rocks and minerals as deposited from aqueous solution or suspension, and in view of this he attached much importance to the study of meteorological conditions. He carried barometers and boiling-point thermometers to the summits of the highest mountains, and estimated the relative humidity of the atmosphere at different heights, its temperature, the strength of solar radiation, the composition of air and its transparency. Then, following the precipitated moisture, he investigated the temperature of the earth at all depths to which he could drive his thermometer staves, the course, conditions, and temperature of streams, rivers, glaciers, and lakes, even of the sea. He invented a great number of instruments for these purposes, tested them, and investigated the theory of their action. The most beautiful and complete of his subsidiary researches is described in the Essai sur 1’Hygrométrie, published in 1783. In it he records experiments made with various forms of hygrometer in all climates and at all temperatures, and supports the claims of his hair-hygrometer against all others. He invented and improved many kinds of apparatus, including the magnetometer, the cyanometer for estimating the blueness of the sky, the diaphanometer for judging of the clearness of the atmosphere, the anemometer, and the mountain eudiometer. His modifications of the thermometer adapted that instrument to many purposes: for ascertaining the temperature of the air he used one with a fine bulb hung in the shade or whirled by a string, the latter form being converted into an evaporometer by inserting its bulb into a piece of wet sponge and making it revolve in a circle of known radius at a known rate; for experiments on the earth and in deep water he employed large thermometers wrapped in non-conducting coatings so as to render them extremely sluggish, and capable of long retaining the temperature once they had attained it. By the use of these instruments he showed that the bottom water of deep lakes is uniformly cold at all seasons, and that the annual heat wave takes six months to penetrate to a depth of 30 feet in the earth. He recognized the immense advantages to meteorology of high-level observing stations, and whenever it was practicable he arranged for simultaneous observations being made at different altitudes for as long periods as possible. It is perhaps as a geologist that Saussure worked most; he examined all the formations he met with much care and exactness; and although his ideas on matters of theory were in many cases very erroneous he was instrumental in greatly advancing that science.

Saussure’s work is collected and summarized in his four large volumes of Voyages dans les Alpes. This book is arranged in the form of a narrative of the author’s various journeys, interspersed with accounts of the observations made and descriptions of the apparatus employed. At the end there is a long list of “agenda,” or subjects for investigation, which he anticipated would throw light on the theory of the earth. These agenda are of value as exhibiting not only the scope and definite focussing of Saussure’s mind but his almost prophetic foresight, since subsequent scientific work has advanced in each department very nearly on the lines there laid down.

His life was written by Senebier in 1801, by Cuvier for the Biographie Universelle, and by Do Candolle in Decade Philosophique, No. xv., translated in the Philosophical Magazine, [i.] iv. 96.
