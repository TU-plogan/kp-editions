ST POL DE LÉON, a town of France, in the arrondissement of Morlaix and department of Finistère, not far from the shorts of the English Channel, 13¾ miles northwest of Morlaix by the railway to Roscoff. This quiet episcopal city, old but modernized, is mainly of interest on account of its cathedral and the church of Notre Dame, though it also contains an episcopal palace (1712-50), a seminary (1691), and a hospital (1711). The cathedral, classed as an historical monument, belongs largely to the 13th century. Besides the west front, with its portico and its two towers with granite spires 180 feet high, the principal points of architectural interest are the traceried window of the south transept (with its glass) and the rectangular apse, and in the interior the stalls of the choir (16th century) and the fascicled pillars and vault-arches of the nave. On the right of the high altar is a wooden shrine containing the bell of St Pol de Léon (6 lb) 10 oz. in weight), which has the repute of curing headache and diseases of the ear, and at the side of the main entrance is a huge baptismal font, popularly regarded as the stone coffin of Conan Mériadec, king of the Bretons. Notre Dame de Creizker has a 15th-century spire, 252 feet high, which crowns the central tower. The north porch is a fine specimen of the flamboyant style. The population of the town in 1881 was 3739 and of the commune 6659.

St Fol de Léon, or Fanum Sancti Pauli Leonini, was formerly a place of considerable importance. The barony of Léon, in the possession of the dukes of Rohan, gave them the right of presiding in the provincial states alternatively with the duke of La Trémouille, baron of Vitré.
