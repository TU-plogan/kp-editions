SABINE, Sir Edward (1788-1883), astronomer, was born in Dublin on 14th October 1788, a scion of a family said to be of Italian origin. He was educated at Woolwich and obtained a commission in the Royal Artillery at the age of fifteen. He attained the rank of major-general in 1859. His only experience of actual warfare seems to have been at the siege of Fort Erie in 1814; but few men have seen more than he of active and sometimes perilous service. In early life he devoted himself to astronomy and physical geography, and in consequence he was appointed astronomer to various expeditions, among others that of Sir J. Ross (1818) in search of the North-West Passage, and that of Sir E. Parry soon afterwards. Later, he spent long periods on the inter-tropical coasts of Africa and America, and again among the snows of Spitzbergen. Sir Edward Sabine died at East Sheen, Surrey, on 26th May 1883.

Of Sabine’s scientific work two branches in particular deserve very high credit—his determination of pendulum data for the investigation of the figure of the earth and his extensive researches connected with terrestrial magnetism. His pendulum observations were the first to show the altogether unexpected amount of accuracy attainable in a matter which, under the most favourable conditions, is one of great delicacy, but which had to be pursued by him under circumstances often of peculiar difficulty. The establishment of a system of magnetic observatories in various parts of British territory all over the globe was accomplished mainly on his representations; and to the direction of these observatories and to the reduction and discussion of the observations a great part of his life was devoted. His published papers, as shown by the Royal Society’s Catalogue, amounted in 1872 to 101. While the majority bear on one or other of the subjects just mentioned, others deal with such widely different topics as the birds of Greenland, ocean temperatures, the Gulf Stream, barometric measurement of heights, arcs of meridian, glacier transport of rocks, the volcanoes of the Sandwich Islands, and various points of meteorology. Sabine occupied for ten years (1861-71) the president’s chair of the Royal Society, and was made K. C.B. in 1869. Though he cannot be said to have been a man of striking originality, his unflagging devotion to his work deservedly won him an honourable position among the foremost scientific men of the present century.
