ST MALO, a seaport town of France, on the English Channel, on the right bank of the estuary of the Rance, is situated in 48° 39' N. lat., 51 miles by rail north-northwest of Rennes. It is the administrative centre of an arrondissement in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine and a first-class garrison town, surrounded by ramparts of the 13th, 16th, and 17th centuries, which are strengthened with great towers at the principal gates. The granite island on which St Malo stands communicates with the mainland only on the north-east by a causeway known as the “Sillon” (furrow), 650 feet long, and at one time only 46 feet broad, though now three times that breadth. This causeway forms part of the site of Rocabey, an industrial suburb more extensive, though less populous, than the town itself. In the sea round about lie other granite rocks, which have been turned to account in the defences of the coast; on the islet of the Grand Bey is the tomb (1848) of Chateaubriand. The rocks and beach in the circuit of St Malo are continually changing their appearance, owing to the violence of the tides. Equinoctial spring-tides sometimes rise 50 feet above low-water level, and during storms the sea sometimes washes over the ramparts. The harbour of St Malo lies south of the town in the creek separating it from the neighbouring town of St Servan. It has a wet dock with from 20 to 25 feet of water (30 feet in spring-tides), and a mile of quays. Additional works are projected, to make the area of the dock 42 acres and the length of quays 1½ miles. Among French seaports St Malo stands twelfth in commercial importance, but first in the number of seamen on its register. The annual imports and exports together amount to 184,000 tons, and 3000 tons of shipping are built yearly. Besides fitting out fishing-boats for Newfoundland, St Malo exports grain, colza-seed, cider, butter, tobacco, and various kinds of provisions to the Channel Islands, with which it is connected by a regular steamboat service. The coasting vessels have a tonnage of about 30,000. Communication between St Malo and St Servan is maintained by a revolving bridge. St Malo is largely frequented for sea-bathing, but not so much as Dinard, on the opposite side of the Rance. Paramé, to the east of

St Malo, has recently sprung into importance. The interior of St Malo presents a tortuous maze of narrow streets and of small squares lined with high and sometimes quaint buildings. The old house in which Duguay-Trouin was born deserves to be noted. Above all rises the stone spire which since 1859 terminates the central tower of the cathedral. The castle, which defends the town towards the “Sillon,” is flanked with four towers, and in the centre rises the great keep, an older and loftier structure, which was breached in 1378 by the duke of Lancaster. St Malo has statues to Chateaubriand and Duguay-Trouin. The museum contains remains of the ship “La Petite Hermine,” in which Jacques Cartier sailed for the discovery of Canada; and the natural history museum possesses a remarkable collection of from 6000 to 7000 European birds. The population of St Malo in 1881 was 10,891 (commune, 11,212).

In the 6th century the granite island on which St Malo now stands was the retreat of Abbot Aaron, who gave asylum in his monastery to Malo (Maclovius or Malovius), a Cambrian priest, who came hither to escape the episcopal dignity, but afterwards became bishop of Aleth (now St Servan); the see was transferred to St Malo only in the 12th century. Jealous of their independence, the inhabitants of St Malo played off against each other the dukes of Brittany and the kings of France, who alternately sought to bring them under subjection. During the troubles of the League they hoped to establish a republican government in their city, and on the night of 11th March 1590 they exterminated the royal garrison and imprisoned their bishop and the canons. But four years later they surrendered to Henry IV. of France. During the following century the maritime power of St Malo attained some importance. In November 1693 the English vainly bombarded St Malo for four consecutive days. In July 1695 they renewed the attempt, but were equally unsuccessful. The people of St Malo had in the course of a single war captured upwards of 1500 vessels (several of them laden with gold and other treasure) and burned a considerable number more. Enriched by these successes and by the wealth they drew from Peru, the shipowners of the town not only supplied the king with the means necessary for the famous Rio de Janeiro expedition conducted by Duguay-Trouin in 1711, but also lent him £1,200,000 for carrying on the War of the Spanish Succession. In June 1758 the English sent a third expedition against St Malo under the command of Marlborough, and inflicted a loss of £480,000 in the harbour. But another expedition undertaken in the following September received a complete check. In 1778 and during the wars of the empire the St Malo privateers resumed their activity. In 1789 St Servan was separated from St Malo and in 1790 St Malo lost its bishopric. During the Reign of Terror the town was the scene of sanguinary executions. Among the celebrities born in St Malo are Jacques Cartier, Duguay-Trouin, Surcouf, and Mahé de la Bourdonnais—all four of naval fame— Maupertuis, Chateaubriand, the Abbé de Lamennais, and Broussais.
