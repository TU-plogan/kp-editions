SESAME, the most important plant of the genus Sesamum (nat. ord. Pedalineae), is that which is used throughout India and other tropical countries for the sake of the oil expressed from its seeds. S. indicum is an herb 2 to 4 feet high, with the lower leaves on long stalks, broad, coarsely toothed or lobed. The upper leaves are opposite, lanceolate, and bear in their axils curved, tubular, twolipped flowers, each about 3/4 inch long, and pinkish or yellowish in colour. The four stamens are of unequal length, with a trace of a fifth stamen, and the two-celled ovary ripens into a two-valved pod with numerous seeds. The plant has been cultivated in the tropics from time immemorial, and is supposed on philological grounds to have been disseminated from the islands of the Indian Archipelago, but at present it is not known with certainty in a wild state. The plant varies in the colour of the flower, and especially in that of the seeds, which range from light yellow or whitish to black. Sesame oil, otherwise known as gingelly or til (not to be confounded with that derived from Guizotia oleifera, known under the same vernacular name), is very largely used for the same purposes as olive oil, and, although less widely known by name, is commercially a much more important oil; thus, apart from the almost universal use of the oil in India, from 50 to 80 millions of kilogrammes of the seed are stated to have been introduced annually into France in 1870- 1872. The seed is also largely exported from Zanzibar and Formosa. The seeds and leaves also are used by the natives as demulcents and for other medicinal purposes. The soot obtained in burning the oil is said to constitute one of the ingredients in India or Chinese ink. The plant might be cultivated with advantage in almost all the tropical and semi-tropical colonies of Britain, but will not succeed in any part of Europe.
