SARABAND (Ital. Sarabanda, Zarabanda·, Fr. Sarabande), a slow dance, generally believed to have been imported from Spain in the earlier half of the 16th century, though attempts have sometimes been made to trace it to an Eastern origin. The etymology of the word is very uncertain. The most probable account is that the dance was named after its inventor—a celebrated dancer[9:21:304] of Seville, called Zarabanda. During the 16th and 17th centuries the saraband was exceedingly popular, alike in Spain, France, Italy, and England. Its music was in triple time—generally with three minims in the bar—and almost always consisted of two strains, each beginning upon the first beat, and most frequently ending on the second or third. Many very fine examples of it will be found among the Suites and Partitas of Handel and J. S. Bach; but by far the finest we possess is that which Handel first composed for his overture to Almira, and afterwards adapted to the words “Lascia, ch’io pianga,” in Rinaldo.
