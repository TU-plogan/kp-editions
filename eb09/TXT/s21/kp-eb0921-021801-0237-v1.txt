SALIERI, Antonio (1750-1825), dramatic composer, was born at Legnano, Italy, August 19, 1750. In 1766 he was taken to Vienna by a former “Kapellmeister” named Gassmann, who introduced him to the emperor Joseph, and fairly prepared the way for his subsequent success. His first opera, Le Donne Letterate, was produced at the Burg-Theater in 1770. On Gassmann’s death in 1774, he received the appointment of Kapellmeister and composer to the court; and on the death of Bonno in 1788 he was advanced to the dignity of “Hofkapellmeister.” He held his offices with honour for fifty years, though he made frequent visits to Italy and Paris, and composed for many important European theatres. His chef d’oeuvre was Tarare (afterwards called Axur, Re d’Ormus), a work which was preferred by the public of Vienna to Mozart’s Don Giovanni, though it is, in reality, quite unworthy of comparison with that marvellous inspiration. It was first produced at Vienna, June 8, 1787, and strangely enough, considering the poverty of its style, it was revived at Leipsic in 1846, though only for a single representation. His last opera was Die Neger, produced in 1804. After this he devoted himself to the composition of church music, for which he had a very decided talent. Salieri lived on friendly terms with Haydn, but was a bitter enemy to Mozart, whose death he was suspected of having produced by poison; but no particle of evidence was ever forthcoming to give colour to the odious accusation. He retired from office, on his full salary, in 1824, and died at Vienna May 7, 1825. None of Salieri’s works have survived the change of fashion. He gave lessons in composition both to Cherubini and Beethoven; the latter dedicated to him his Three Sonatas for Pianoforte and Violin, Op. 12.
