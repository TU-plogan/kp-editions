SCYLAX of Caryanda in Caria was employed by Darius I. to explore the course of the Indus. He started from Afghanistan and is said by Herodotus (iv. 44) to have reached the sea and then sailed to the Gulf of Suez (comp. Persia, vol. xviii. p. 569). Scylax wrote an account of his explorations, which is referred to by Aristotle and other ancient writers, but must have been lost pretty early, and probably also a history of the Carian hero Heraclides, who distinguished himself in the revolt against Darius.^[1. See A. V. Gutschmidt, in Rhein. Mus., 1854, p. 141 sq. ] But Suidas, who mentions the second work, confounds the old Scylax with a much later author, who wrote a refutation of the history of Polybius, and is presumably identical with Scylax of Halicarnassus, a statesman and astrologer, the friend of Panaetius spoken of by Cicero (De Div., ii. 42). Neither of these, however, can be the author of the Periplus of the Mediterranean, which has come down to us under the name of Scylax of Caryanda in several MSS., of which the archetype is at Paris. This work is little more than a sailor’s handbook of places and distances all round the coast of the Mediterranean and its branches, and then along the outer Libyan coast as far as the Carthaginians traded; but various notices of towns and the states to which they belong enable us to fix the date with considerable precision. Niebuhr gave the date 352-348 b.c., others bring it down a year or two later, and C. Müller as late as 338-335, which is only possible if the writer’s information was sometimes rather stale. See the discussion in Müller’s edition (Geog. Gr. Min., vol. i., Paris, 1855), and against him Unger, in Philologus, 1874, p. 29 sq., who con-[9:21:574] cludes for the year 347. The latest edition is that of Fabricius (Leipsic, 1878).
