SAND-GROUSE, the name^[1. It seems to have been first used by Latham in 1783 (Synopsis, iv. p. 751) as the direct translation of the name Tetrao arenarius given by Pallas. ] by which are commonly known the members of a small but remarkable group of birds frequenting sandy tracts, and having their feet more or less clothed with feathers after the fashion of Grouse (vol. xi. p. 221), to which they were originally thought to be closely allied, and the species first described were by the earlier systematists invariably referred to the genus Tetrao. Their separation therefrom is due to Temminck, who made for them a distinct genus which he called Pterocles, ^[2. He states that he published this name in 1809; but hitherto research has failed to find it used until 1815. ] and his view, as Lesson tells us (Traité, p. 515), was subsequently corroborated by De Blainville; while in 1831 Bonaparte (Saggio, p. 54) recognized the group as a good Family, Pediophili or Pterocliae. Further investigation of the osteology and pterylosis of the Sand-Grouse revealed still greater divergence from the normal Gallinae (to which the true Grouse belong), as well as several curious resemblances to the Pigeons; and in the Zoological Society’s Proceedings for 1868 (p. 303) Prof. Huxley proposed to regard them, under the name of Pteroclomorphae, as forming a group equivalent to the Alectoromorphae. and Peristeromorphae, for reasons already briefly stated (Ornithology, vol. xviii. p. 46).^[3. Some more recent writers, recognizing the group as a distinct Order, have applied to it the name “Pterocletes," while another calls it Heteroditae. The former of these words is based on a grammatical misconception, while the use of the latter has long since been otherwise preoccupied in zoology. If there be need to set aside Prof. Huxley’s term, Bonaparte’s Pediophili (as above mentioned) may be accepted, and indeed has priority of all others. ] The Pteroclidae consist of two genera— Pterocles, with about fifteen species, and Syrrhaptes, with two. Of the former, two species inhabit Europe, P. arenarius, the Sand-Grouse proper, and that which is usually called P. alchata, the Pin-tailed SandGrouse. The European range of the first is practically limited to Portugal, Spain, and the southern parts of Russia, while the second inhabits also the south of France, where it is generally known by its Catalan name of “Ganga,” or locally as “Grandaulo,” or, strange to say, “Perdrix d'Angleterre’’ Both species are also abundant in Barbary, and have been believed to extend eastwards through Asia to India, in most parts of which country they seem to be only winter-visitants; but in 1880 Herr Bogdanow pointed out to the Academy of St Petersburg (Bulletin, xxvii. p. 164) a slight difference of coloration between eastern and western examples of what had hitherto passed as P. alchata ; and the difference, if found to be constant, may require the specific recognition of each, while analogy would suggest that a similar difference might be found in examples of P. arenarius. India, moreover, possesses five other species of Pterocles, of which however only one, P. fasciatus, is peculiar to Asia, while the others inhabit Africa as well, and all the remaining species belong to the Ethiopian region—one, P. personatus, being peculiar to Madagascar, and four occurring in or on the borders of the Cape Colony.

The genus Syrrhaptes, though in general appearance resembling Pterocles, has a conformation of foot quite unique among birds, the three anterior toes being encased in a common “podotheca,” which is clothed to the claws with hairy feathers, so as to look much like a fingerless glove. The hind toe is wanting. The two species of Syrrhaptes are S. tibetanus— the largest Sand-Grouse known— inhabiting the country whence its trivial name is derived, and S. paradoxus, ranging from Northern China across Central Asia to the confines of Europe, which it occa[9:21:259] sionally, and in a marvellous manner, invades, as has been already briefly described (Birds, vol. iii. p. 770).^[4. Some slight additions to and corrections of that account may here be given. A sixth example is stated ( Ibis, 1871, p. 223) to have been killed in Europe in 1859, namely, at Perpignan in France. One is believed to have been obtained at or near Archangel ( Ibis, 1873, p. 66); but the report of one in Sicily proves to have been a mistake, and Rimini, on the Adriatic, remains the most southern Italian locality reached in 1863. Since 1872 a male obtained near Modena in May 1876 ( Ibis, 1881, p. 206), and a pair, one of which was shewn to the writer, in the county of Kildare in Ireland, the following October ( Zoologist, 1877, p. 24), are all that are known to have occurred in Western Europe. ] Though its attempts at colonization in the extreme west have failed, it would seem to have established itself of late years in the neighbourhood of Astrakhan (Ibis, 1882, p. 220). It appears to be the “Barguerlac ” of Marco Polo (ed. Yule, i. p. 239); and the “Loung-Kio” or “Dragon’s Foot,” so unscientifically described by the Abbé Huc (Souvenirs d’un Voyage dans la Tartarie, i. p. 244), can scarcely be anything else than this bird.

Externally all Sand-Grouse present an appearance so distinctive that nobody who has seen one of them can be in doubt as to any of the rest. Their plumage assimilates in general colour to that of the ground they frequent, being above of a dull ochreous hue, more or less barred or mottled by darker shades, while beneath it is frequently varied by belts of deep brown intensifying into black. Lighter tints are, however, exhibited by some species,—the drab merging into a pale grey, the buff brightening into a lively orange, and streaks or edgings of an almost pure white relieve the prevailing sandy or fawn-coloured hues that especially characterize the group. The sexes seem always to differ in plumage, that of the male being the brightest and most diversified. The expression is decidedly Dove-like, and so is the form of the body, the long wings contributing also to that effect, so that among Anglo-Indians these birds are commonly known as “Rock-Pigeons.” The long wings, the outermost primary of which in Syrrhaptes has its shaft produced into an attenuated filament, are in all the species worked by exceedingly powerful muscles, and in several forms the middle rectrices are likewise protracted and pointed, so as to give to their wearers the name of Pin-tailed Sand-Grouse.^[5. These were separated by Bonaparte ( Comptes Rendus, xlii. p. 880) as a distinct genus, Pteroclurus, which later authors have justly seen no reason to adopt. ] The nest is a shallow hole in the sand. Three seems to be the regular complement of eggs laid in each nest, but there are writers who declare (most likely in error) that the full number in some species is four. These eggs are of peculiar shape, being almost cylindrical in the middle and nearly alike at each end, and are of a pale earthy colour, spotted, blotched, or marbled with darker shades, the markings being of two kinds, one superficial and the other more deeply seated in the shell. The young are hatched fully clothed in down (P. Z. S. 1866, pl. ix. fig. 2), and though not very active would appear to be capable of locomotion soon after birth. Morphologically generalized as the Sand-Grouse undoubtedly are, no one can contest the extreme specialization of many of their features, and thus they form one of the most instructive groups of birds with which ornithologists are acquainted. The remains of an extinct species of Pterocles, P. sepultus, intermediate apparently between P. alchata and P. gutturalis, have been recognized in the Miocene caves of the Allier by Prof. A. Milne-Edwards (Ois . foss. de la France, p. 294, pl. clxi. figs. 1-9); and, in addition to the other authorities on this very interesting group of birds already cited, reference may be made to Mr Elliot’s “Study” of the Family (P. Z. S., 1878, pp. 233-264) and Dr Gadow, “On certain points in the Anatomy of Pterocles” (op. dt., 1882, pp. 312-332). (A. N. )
