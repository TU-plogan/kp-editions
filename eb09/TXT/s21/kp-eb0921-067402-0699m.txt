SERAING, a town of Belgium, stretching nearly a mile along the right bank of the Meuse, across which a suspension bridge connects it with Jemeppe, 3 miles southwest of Liége. It has one of the largest manufactories of machinery on the Continent, founded by John Cockerill, an Englishman, in 1817, on the site of the former palace of the prince-bishops of Liége. Including offices, the works extend over 270 acres, employ 11,000 hands, and the annual value of their products is more than 45,000,000 francs. Down to 1882 they had turned out 52,600 engines or pieces of machinery, including the first locomotive engine built on the Continent (1835). After Cockerill’s death in 1840, the works were purchased by “La John Cockerill Société.” A monument was erected to his memory in 1871. The population, which numbered but 2226 in 1827, amounted to 24,315 in 1877, and is now (1886) estimated at about 27,500.
