SHERBORNE, an ancient market-town of Dorsetshire, England, on the borders of Somersetshire, is situated on the southern slope of a hill overlooking the river Yeo, on the South-Western Railway, 6 miles east from Yeovil and 118 south-west from London by rail. In 705 Sherborne was made by Ina, king of the West Saxons, the seat of a bishopric, which in 1078 was removed to Old Sarum (Salisbury). Previous to its removal a great Benedictine abbey had been founded by Bishop Roger. The minster or abbey church of St Mary possesses a Norman tower, much altered by later additions, and transepts also originally Norman, but the greater part of the building is Perpendicular. It was restored in 1848-58 at an expense of over £32,000, chiefly contributed by Mr W. Digby and Lord Digby. Ethelbald and Ethelbert, elder brothers of Alfred, were buried behind the high altar of the church, which contains a number of interesting tombs and monuments. Near the minster are the ruins of the castle, originally the palace of the bishops. It was besieged during the wars between Stephen and Maud, and also during those of the Commonwealth, when it was held for the king in 1642 by the marquis of Hertford, and resisted a five days’ siege by the earl of Bedford, but was in 1645 taken by Fairfax, when it was dismantled and reduced to ruins. The older portion of the modern mansion was built by Sir Walter Raleigh. Sherborne grammar school, occupying the site of the abbey, was founded by Edward VI. in 1550, and holds a high rank among the public schools of England. Near the abbey close is the hospital of St John, dating from the 15th century. A literary institution, now called the Macready Institution, was established in 1850. The manor of Sherborne went with the bishop’s see, till in the reign of Elizabeth it was conferred on Sir Walter Raleigh. After his attainder it was bestowed by James I. on his favourite Carr, after which it passed to the Digbys, the present owners. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 411 acres) in 1871 was 5545, and in 1881 it was 5053.
