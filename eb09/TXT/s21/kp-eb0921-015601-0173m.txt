ST ALBANS, a township and village of the United States, the capital of Franklin county, Vermont, at the junction of several divisions of the Central Vermont Railroad. The village lies on an elevated plain about 3 miles east of Lake Champlain, and has its principal buildings arranged round a public park. Besides being the seat of the extensive workshops of the railroad company, St Albans is the great cheese and butter market of the eastern States. In the neighbourhood, which is celebrated for the beauty of its scenery, are quarries of calico stone and variegated marble. The population of the township was 1814 in 1850, 3G37 in 1860, 7014 in 1870, and 7193 in 1880. Being only 14 miles distant from the Canadian frontier, the village has more than once been the scene of political disturbances. In 1866 a band of 1200 Fenians, on their return from a fruitless invasion of Canada, were disarmed there by the United States troops.
