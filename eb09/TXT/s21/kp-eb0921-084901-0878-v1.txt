SHUSTAR, or Shustar, Shúshtar (Arab. Tostar), once a flourishing provincial capital of Persia, is now a comparatively unimportant town of 6000 inhabitants,—exclusive, however, of the Bakhtiáris, who during the winter months encamp with their flocks and herds in the immediate vicinity. It is situated (32° 3' 30" N. lat. and 48° 52' E. long.) at the foot of an offshoot of the Bakhtiári Mountains in the north-west of Khuzistán, and just below the point in the Kárún (Dojail or Little Tigris) where—the main stream running westwards—a cutting of 70 feet deep has been made through the natural rock for an easterly branch. Thence the two streams, enclosing a wide alluvial tract, of which Shustar is the crown, follow independent courses until they reunite some 40 miles to the south. According to Lieutenant Selby, I.N., who ascended the Karún from Muhamrah (Mohammera) in 1842 by the Shutait (or main stream on the west) to within 6 miles, and further tested the navigation of the Ab-i-Gargar (or eastern channel) to within 1 mile, of Shustar, the town is built on a small hill which rises gradually from the south-west and increases in elevation to the citadel, which presents on the northeastern side an abrupt face of about 150 feet in length, having the river immediately beneath. Mr Loftus, who visited Shustar some eight years after Lieutenant Selby, gives an account of the two great dams thrown across the river,—the " Band-i-Mizán” over the natural course, the " Band-i-Kaisar” over the artificially diverted branch. About a mile below the latter is a similar work of more recent and more solid and substantial construction, called the "Púl,” or bridge of Belaiti. Legend ascribes these ancient works to Shâpúr I. and his captive the emperor Valerian. In 1875, and again in 1878, Mr Mackenzie visited Shustar; he speaks of the town as being in a wretchedly decayed and filthy condition. The houses are of stone, some few good, with underground rooms (sardábs or zír zamin) excavated to a depth of two stories below the ground level. In these relief is obtained from the intense summer heat. The traffic of the bazaar, which is a poor one, seemed to depend chiefly on the Iliyáts or wandering tribes. The inhabitants—for the most part Arabs and Sâiyids—have a reputation for hospitality.

Some writers have identified Shúshar with Susa (Shushan of the Bible), the capital of Susiana and a residence of the Achaemenian kings. The true site of the latter, however, as Loftus’s explorations showed, is at Shush, a widely spread ruin 30 or 40 miles to the north-west. On the other side of Shustar is the locally classic ground of Ram Hormuz. In fact, of the whole neighbourhood Sir H. Rawlinson writes that it “still requires elaborate exploration, and would well repay any traveller who would devote six months to examining the ruins and carefully copying the inscriptions.”

The river Kanin, which rises in the Bakhtiárí Mountains and passes down the broad Shattu 'l-'Arab, joins the Tigris and Euphrates. It has been declared by many and trustworthy authorities to be well adapted for steam navigation—save as regards one obstacle at Ahwaz, removable at little cost—from its mouth to the near neighbourhood of Shustar. Thence to Ispahan the land journey would be shorter than from Bushahr (Bushire) to that city by 200 miles.
