SHEPTON MALLET, a market-town of Somersetshire, England, is situated at the eastern extremity of the Mendip Hills, on the Somerset and Devon and the East Somerset Railways, 5 miles east of Wells and 20 south of Bristol. The church of Sts Peter and Paul, consisting of chancel, clerestoried nave, and aisles, is specially worthy of notice for its richly carved wooden roof and the ancient monuments of the Mallets and Gournays, formerly possessors of the manor. The grammar school was founded in 1677, and there are also a science and art school in connexion with South Kensington, a literary institute, and a mechanicsâ€™ institute. The principal public buildings are the court-house (1857), the masonic hall (1861), the prison, and the district hospital (1880). The market cross, one of the finest in the county, 51 feet in height, erected by Agnes and Thomas Buckland in 1500, was restored in 1841. About the end of last century Shepton Mallet had important cloth manufactures, and stocking-knitting was also largely carried on. The brewing of ale and porter is now one of its principal industries, and it has also ropeworks and brick and tile works. In the vicinity there are granite quarries and marble, asphalt, and lime works. The population of the urban sanitary district (area, 3572 acres) in 1871 was 5149, and in 1881 it was 5322.

Shepton, previous to the Conquest called Sepeton, was in the possession of the abbots of Glastonbury for four hundred years before it passed to Roger de Courcelle. Afterwards it came into the possession of the barons Malet or Mallet, one of whom was fined for rebellion in the reign of King John. From the Mallets it went to the Gournays, but in 1536 it reverted to the crown, and it is now included in the duchy of Cornwall. The town received the grant of a market from Edward II.
