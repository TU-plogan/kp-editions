SCHLESWIG (Danish Slevυig), the capital of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein, is situated at the west end of the long narrow arm of the sea called the Schlei, 30 miles to the north-west of Kiel. The town consists mainly of a single street, 3 ½ miles long, forming a semicircle round the Schlei, and is divided into the Altstadt (with the Holm), the Lollfuss, and the Friedrichsberg. The principal church, erected as a cathedral about 1100, but renewed in the Gothic style in the 15th century, contains a very fine carved oak altar-screen. regarded as the most valuable work of art in[9:21:414] Schleswig-Holstein. Between Friedrichsberg and Lollfuss is the old chateau of Gottorp, now despoiled of its art treasures and used as barracks. The former commercial importance of the town has disappeared, and the Schlei now affords access to small vessels only. Fishing and the manufacture of a few articles of common use are the chief occupations of the inhabitants. The population in 1885 was 15,187, all Protestants except about 250 Roman Catholics and 70 Jews.

Schleswig (ancient forms Sliesthorp, Sliaawic, i.e., the town or hay of the Slia or Schlei) is a town of very remote origin, and seems to have been a trading place of considerable importance as early as the 9th century. It served as a medium of commercial intercourse between the North Sea and the Baltic, and was known to the old Arabian geographers. The first Christian church in this district was built here by Ansgarius about 850, and it became the seat of a bishop about a century later. The town also became the seat of the dukes of Schleswig, but its commerce gradually dwindled owing to the rivalry of Lübeck, the numerous wars in which the district was involved, and the silting up of the Schlei. At the partition of 1544 the old chateau of Gottorp, originally built in 1160 for the bishop, became the residence of the ducal or Gottorp line of Schleswig-Holstein, which remained here till expelled by Frederick IV. in 1713. From 1731 to 1846 it was the seat of the Danish governors of the duchies. In the wars of 1848 and 1864 Schleswig was an important strategical point on account of its proximity to the Danewerk, and was occupied by the different contending parties in turn. It has been the capital of Schleswig-Holstein since its incorporation by Prussia.

To the south of Schleswig are the scanty remains of the Danewerk or Dannewirke, a line of entrenchments between the Schlei and the Treene, believed to have been originally thrown up in the 9th century or even earlier, and afterwards repeatedly strengthened and enlarged. After the union of Schleswig and Holstein it lost its importance as a frontier defence, and was allowed to fall into disrepair. The Danewerk was stormed by the Prussians in 1848, but was afterwards so greatly extended and strengthened by the Danes that it would have been almost impregnable if defended by a sufficient number of troops. In the war of 1864, however, the Danish army was far too small for this task, and General de Meza abandoned the Danewerk without striking a blow, a step which caused deep disappointment to the Danes and led to the dismissal of the general. Since then the works have been entirely levelled.
