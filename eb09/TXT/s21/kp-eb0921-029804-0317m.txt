SANTERRE, Jean Baptiste (1650-1717), French painter, born at Magny near Pontoise in 1650, was a pupil of Bon Boulogne. He began life as a portraitpainter, but refused to paint any except those who pleased his taste; he was incapable of managing the large compositions then in vogue, but enjoyed for half a century a great reputation as a painter of the nude. He had opened his studio to a class of young girls, to whom he gave lessons, and who served him as models. Much, however, of Santerre’s work of this class was destroyed by himself in a fit of lively repentance after a serious illness which attacked him late in life. He died at Paris on November 21, 1717. His paintings, in consequence of his extreme care in choice of vehicles and pigments, have stood well. His Portrait of a Lady in Venetian Costume (Louvre), and his Susanna at the Bath (Louvre, engraved by Porporati), the diploma work executed by him in 1704, when he was received into the Academy, give a good impression of Santerre’s taste and of his elaborate and careful method.
