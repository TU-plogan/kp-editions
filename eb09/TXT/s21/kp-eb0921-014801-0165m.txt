SAGINAW, a city of the United States, capital of Saginaw county, Michigan, lies on an elevated plateau about 30 feet above the water on the left bank of the Saginaw river, which falls into Saginaw Bay on Lake Huron, about 18 miles lower down. It is a railway junction of some importance, 100 miles north-west of Detroit, is connected with East Saginaw by a street railway, and can be reached by the largest vessels that ply on the lake. The upper branches of the river are also available for boat traffic throughout a considerable district. Saw-mills, planing-mills, and salt-works are the principal industrial establishments. The population was 7460 in 1870 and 10,525 in 1880. The city charter dates from 1859, the first settlement from 1822.
