SADDLERY embraces the industries connected with the harnessing and controlling of all beasts of draught and burden. The materials used in harnessing the various creatures so employed and the modifications of harness necessary to suit their structure, temperament, and duties are, of course, exceedingly varied. In a restricted sense saddlery is principally a leather trade, and has to do with the harnessing of the horse. The craft has been recognized and established in England as a separate trade since the 13th century, when the London Saddlers’ Company received its charter of incorporation from Edward I. There is evidence also of its early prosperity at Birmingham, where it grew to an importance which it still retains, the principal seat of the saddlery trade being now at Walsall near Birmingham, which is practically a saddlers’ town. The trade divides itself into two branches, brown saddlery and black saddlery. The former is concerned with saddle-making and the cutting and sewing of bridles, reins, and all other uncoloured leather-work. The saddle is the most important article on the brown saddler’s list. It consists of the tree or skeleton, on which the leather is stretched, the seat, the skirts, and the flaps. The tree is commonly made of beech strengthened with iron plates. The whole leather-work ought to be of pig-skin, but often the seat alone is of that material, the other parts being imitation, cleverly grained by means of electro-deposit copper casts from the surface of real pig-skin. There are many varieties of saddles, such as racing, military, hunting, and ladies’ saddles, &c. A racing saddle may weigh not more than two or three pounds, while a cavalry saddle will be four times heavier. The saddle-maker has to consider the ease and comfort of both horse and rider. The saddle must fit closely and evenly to the curvature of the horse’s back without tendency to shift, and it ought to offer as far as possible a soft and elastic seat for the rider. The black saddler is concerned with the harness of carriage, cart, and draught horses generally. The skill of the tradesman in this department is displayed in designing and arranging harness most favourable for the proper distribution of the load, and for bringing into use the muscles of the animal without chafing or fraying the skin. Much of the usefulness and comfort of a horse depends on the accurate and proper fit of its harness. The collar and traces and the saddle are the important features of draught harness, the former being the pieces through which the draught is effected, while dead weight is borne through the saddle. The portions of saddlery by which the horseman controls and guides the horse are the bridle and bit and the reins. Into the many devices connected with these and other parts of harness for curbing horses, for breaking them of evil habits, and for adding to the security of the equestrian and carriage traveller, we cannot here enter (compare Horsemanship, vol. xii. p. 198). Saddler’s ironmongery forms an important feature of the trade. It embraces the making of buckles, chains, cart-gearing, stirrups, spurs, bits, hames, &c. The ornamental metal-work of carriage-harness is either electro-plated in silver or of solid polished brass.
