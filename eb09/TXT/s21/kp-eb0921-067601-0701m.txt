SERGIUS I., pope from 687 to 701, came of an Antiochene family which had settled at Palermo, and owed his election as Cononâ€™s successor to skilful intrigues against Paschalis and Theodorus, the other candidates. In the second year of his pontificate he baptized King Ceadwalla of Wessex at Rome. For rejecting certain canons of the Trullan (Quinisext) council of 692, Justinian II. commanded his arrest and transportation to Constantinople, but the militia of Ravenna and the Pentapolis forced the imperial protospatharius to abandon the attempt to carry out his orders. Sergius was followed by John VI. as pope.
