SANTILLANA, Iñigo Lopez de Mendoza, Marquis of (1398-1458), Castilian poet, was born at Carrion de los Condes in Old Castile on August 19, 1398. His father, Don Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, grand admiral of Castile, having died while Inigo was still quite young, the boy was brought up by his uncle Don Alfonso Enriquez. From his twentieth year onwards he became an increasingly prominent figure at the court of Juan II. of Castile, distinguishing himself both in civil and military service; he was created Marques de Santillana and Conde del Real do Manzanares for the part he took in the battle of Olmedo in 1445. In the protracted struggle of the Castilian nobles against the preponderating influence of Alvaro de Luna he showed great moderation, but ultimately in 1452 he joined the combination which effected the fall of the favourite in the following year. From the death of Juan II. in 1454 Mendoza took little part in public affairs, devoting himself mainly to the pursuits of literature and to pious meditation. He died at Guadalajara on March 26, 1458.

Mendoza was the first to introduce the Italian sonnet into Castile, but his productions in this class are somewhat conventional in style and have little to recommend them beyond the charm of smooth versification. He was much more successful in the scrranilla or highland pastoral after the Provençal manner. His long-popular Gcntiloquio (1494), consisting of one hundred proverbs, each rendered in an eight-line stanza, was prepared at the request of Juan II. for the instruction of Don Enrique, the heir-apparent. To the same didactic category belong the Diálogo de Bias contra Fortuna (1448) and the Doctrinal dc Prívados (1453). The Comedicta dc Ponza is a Dantesque dream-dialogue, in octave stanzas, founded on the disastrous sea-fight off Ponza in 1435, when the kings of Aragon and Navarre along with the infante of Castile were taken prisoners by the Genoese.

The works of Santillana have been edited with commentaries by Amador de los Rios (Madrid, 1852).
