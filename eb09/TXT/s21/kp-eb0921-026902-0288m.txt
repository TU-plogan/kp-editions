SAN SEBASTIAN, a seaport of Spain, capital of the province of Guipuzcoa, 42 miles north-north-west of Pamplona, and 402 miles by rail from Madrid. It occupies a narrow isthmus, terminated towards the north by a lofty conical rock called Urgull or Orgullo, and flanked on its eastern side by the river Urumea, here crossed by a bridge, and on the other by a bay (La Concha), which forms the harbour. The summit of the hill is crowned by a fort (Castillo de la Mota), and the landward side of the town was formerly defended by solid ramparts.

The houses are almost all modern, built uniformly in straight streets and regular squares, so as to present an appearance quite unlike most Spanish towns. There are two large churches, a court-house, a theatre, hospitals, barracks, &c. The manufactures of the place are insignificant; and the harbour is small, and not easily accessible, though well protected by a mole and small island. There is a considerable trade in English and French goods,â€”corn and other articles being exported. During summer the town is much frequented, especially by the wealthier inhabitants of Madrid, for sea-bathing, and tent-like huts are set up for the purpose on the shore of the bay. From its position and strength San Sebastian has been long a place of much importance, and has sustained several sieges. The most memorable of these was in August 1813, when the British, under Wellington, took it by storm. The population within the municipal boundaries was 21,355 in 1877.
