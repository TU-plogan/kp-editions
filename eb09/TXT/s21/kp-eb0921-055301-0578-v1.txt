SCRIBE, Augustin Eugène (1791-1861), the most popular playwright of France, was born at Paris on 24th December 1791, and died there on 20th February 1861. His father was a silk merchant and he was well educated, being destined for the bar. But, having a real gift for the theatre (a gift which unfortunately was not allied with sufficient literary power to make his works last), he very soon broke away from professional study and at the age of twenty produced, in collaboration, as is common in France, the first of a series of dramas which continued for fifty years. Les Demis (1811). is usually cited as the first play in which he took a hand, though, as for some time he did not sign his work, identification is somewhat difficult. He achieved no distinct success till 1816, when Une Nuit de Garde Nationale made him in a way famous. Thenceforward his fertility was unceasing and its results prodigious. There may be in existence a complete list of Scribe’s works, but we have never seen any that pretended to be such. He wrote every kind of drama—vaudevilles,[9:21:554] comedies, tragedies, opera-libretti. To one theatre alone he is said to have furnished more than a hundred pieces. But his life was entirely uneventful, and his election to the Academy in 1834 is almost the only incident which deserves chronicling. It ought to be said to Scribe’s credit that, although he was the least original of writers and was more an editor of dramas than a dramatist, although he was for many years an object of the bitterest envy to impecunious geniuses owing to his pecuniary success, and although he never has pleased and never can please any critic who applies purely literary tests, his character stands very high for literary probity and indeed generosity. He is said in some cases to have sent sums of money for “copyright in ideas” to men who not only had not actually collaborated with him but who were unaware that he had taken suggestions from their work. His industry was untiring and his knowledge both of the mechanism of the stage and of the tastes of the audience was wonderful. Nevertheless he hardly deserves a place in literature, his style being vulgar, his characters commonplace, even his plots lacking power and grasp. He wrote a few novels, but none of any mark. The best known of Scribe’s pieces after his first successful one are Une Chaîne (1842), Le Verre d' Eau (1842), Adrienne Lecouvreur (1849), and the libretti of many of the most famous operas of the middle of the century, especially those of Auber and Meyerbeer.
