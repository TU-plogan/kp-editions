SÁWANTWÁRI, or Sawuntwarrie, a native state forming the southern part of the Concan division of the Bombay presidency, India, and lying between 15° 37' and 16° 16' N. lat. and between 73° 36' and 74° 21' E. long. It has a total area of about 900 square miles, and is bounded on the north and west by Ratnagiri district, on the east by the Sahyádri Mountains, and on the south by the Portuguese territory of Goa. The general aspect of the country is strikingly picturesque. Its surface is broken and rugged, interspersed with densely-wooded hills; in the valleys are gardens and groves of cocoa-nut and betel-nut palms. Sáwantwári has no rivers of any considerable size; the chief streams are the Karli on the north and the Terekhol on the south, both navigable for small craft. The climate is humid and relaxing, with an average annual rainfall of over 130 inches. The forests and wooded[9:21:343] slopes of the Sahyádris contain large numbers of wild animals, including the tiger, panther, leopard, bear, hyaena, &c. Snakes and other reptiles also abound. The state possesses no railway; but there is an excellent trunk road through the territory.

The census of 1881 returned the population of Sáwantwári at 174,433 (males 86,061, females 88,372); Hindus numbered 166,080, Mohammedans 3970, and Christians 4213. Agriculture supports the greater part of the population. The staple product is rice, but excepting rice none but the coarsest grains and pulses are raised, both soil, which is stony, and climate being against the cultivation of wheat and other superior grains; oil seeds, hemp, and pepper are also grown. The gross revenue of the state in 1883-84 amounted to about £34,000. Before the establishment of Portuguese power (1510) Sáwantwári was the highway of a great traffic; but during the 16th and 17th centuries trade suffered much from the rivalry of the Portuguese, and in the disturbances of the 18th century it almost entirely disappeared. Since the establishment of order under the British (1819), trade has considerably developed. The present chief being a minor, the administration has been in the hands of the British since 1869.
