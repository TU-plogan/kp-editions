SCIACCA, a town of Italy, in the province of Girgenti, Sicily, 28 miles south-east of Castelvetrano (Selinus) and 37 north-west of Girgenti, lies on the south coast on a steep rocky decline, and with its walls and castles has from a distance an imposing appearance. The cathedral was founded in 1090 by Julia de Hauteville, daughter of Roger I., who had presented her with the lordship of Sciacca on her marriage with Perollo; and two other churches, S. Salvadore and S. Maria delle Giummare, date from the same period. In the cliffs are excavated granaries in which under the Spanish viceroys the grain used to be stored under Government control. To the east of the town, at the foot of Monte S. Calogero, are the hot wells (sulphurous and saline) of Sciacca; and the steam that breaks forth from the top of the hill seems to have been used (as it still is) for vapour baths from a remote (possibly Phoenician) period. The population was 21,451 (22,195 including Marina) in 1881.

Sciacca was the birthplace of Tommaso Fazello (1498-1570), the historian of Sicily. In the 15th century it was the scene of a terrible feud between the Perollos (lords of Sciacca) and the counts of Luna.
