ST LUCIA, a West India island, discovered by Columbus in 1502, is situated in 13° 50' N. lat. and 60° 58' W. long., and has a length of 42 miles and a maximum breadth of 21. Pigeon Island, formerly an important military post, lies at its northern extremity. Originally inhabited by Caribs, St Lucia was settled by the English in 1639, and, after many alternations of English and French possession, surrendered to the British arms in 1794. Sir John Moore was governor till 1797. St Lucia was subsequently in French possession, but was finally restored to Great Britain in 1803. The scenery consists of mountain, valley, and forest; two cone-shaped rocks rise out of the sea to a height of 3000 feet, and near them are craters of extinct volcanoes and a solfatara. The island is considered a good coaling station for mail-steamers and war-ships; there is a good harbour on the west coast, below Castries, the capital (population, 5000). The total population was 40,532 in 1883, of whom 1000 were white, mostly French. St Lucia forms part of the general government of the Windward Islands (from which Barbados is excluded); it has a legislative council composed of officials and crown nominees. The annual revenue and expenditure were £43,026 and £36,652 respectively in 1883, the debt (principally for Central Sugar Factory) being £32,400. The tonnage of vessels entered and cleared was 438,688; the total imports were valued at £191,191 and the exports (sugar, 7600 tons; cocoa, 307,120 lb) at £213,823. The Usine or Central Factory system has been established with Government assistance.
