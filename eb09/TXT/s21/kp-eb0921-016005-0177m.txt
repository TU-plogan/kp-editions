ST CYR-L’ÉCOLE, a village of France (Seine-et-Oise), 2 1/2 miles west of Versailles at the end of the old park of Louis XIV. It had only 2712 inhabitants in 1881, and its importance is solely due to the famous military school now established in the convent which Madame de Maintenon founded for the education of noble young ladies in indigent circumstances. It was here that Racine’s Esther and Athalie were first acted, having been written expressly for the pupils. Madame de Maintenon’s tomb is still preserved in the chapel. The convent was suppressed at the Revolution, and the gardens are now partly transformed into parade-grounds. Two advanced forts of the new enceinte round Paris are situated at St Cyr.
