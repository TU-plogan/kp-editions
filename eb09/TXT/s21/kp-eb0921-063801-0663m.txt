SELKIRK, a lowland county of Scotland, of tortuous outline, is bounded by Midlothian on the N., by Peebles on the N. and W., by Dumfries on the S., and by Roxburgh on the E. Its extreme length from south-west to northeast is 28 miles, its greatest breadth from east to west 17, and its total area 260 square miles or 166,524 acres, of which 1997 are water. This includes two detached portions, one to the north-west, surrounded by Peebles, and another on the east, the estate and barony of Sinton, separated from Roxburgh in the reign of William the Lion on the appointment of Andrew de Synton to the sheriffship of Selkirk. From its lowest altitude (300 feet) at the junction of the Gala and the Tweed the surface rises to 2433 feet at Dun Rig, a wild and desolate summit on the western boundary. Level haughs, beds of ancient lakes, occur in the courses of the rivers; but the county is otherwise wholly mountainous and only a small proportion of it arable. Of its principal summits, Ettrick Pen (2269), Capel Fell (2223), Deer Law (2064), Herman Law (2014), are in the south, and Windlestrae Law (2161) in the north, about a mile from the borders of Midlothian. Broadly speaking, Selkirk may be said to consist of the two entire valleys of Ettrick and Yarrow and a section of the valley of Tweed, the first two sloping from the south until they merge in the last, which forms the northern portion of the county. Besides St Mary’s Loch and its adjunct the Loch of the Lowes, together about 4 1/2 miles long, there are several others of considerable size, mostly in the eastern uplands between Ettrick and Teviotdale—the two lochs of Shaws, Clearburn Loch, Kingside Loch, Hellmuir Loch, Alemuir Loch, and Akermuir Loch. These, with the larger rivers and the mountain “burns,” attract anglers to Selkirk from all parts of the kingdom.

Geologically, the Selkirk rocks are a portion of that great Silurian mass which occupies the south of Scotland from Wigtown to the north-east coast of Berwick. At no part are they known to be covered by rocks of later formation; but here and there (at Windlestrae Law and Priest-hope, for example) igneous rocks protrude in massive outcrops, almost granitic, one measuring over 100 feet in thickness. The hillsides yield inexhaustible supplies of blue-grey whinstone, suitable for building; but repeated efforts to establish slate-quarries and lead-mines have ended in failure. According to records of the 16 th century, gold was found at Mount Benger, Douglas Craig, and Linglie Burn,—“an ingenious gentleman” named Bevis Bulmer having been “most successful upon Henderland Moor in Ettrick Forest, where he got the greatest gold—the like to it in no other place before of Scotland.”

Corresponding with the high average altitude, the prevailing climate is cold and wet, and, as the soil is mostly thin, over a close subsoil of clayey “till,” agriculture is carried on at a disadvantage. About the middle of the 19th century large areas of virgin soil were brought under tillage; but the prudence of the “improvement” is now greatly doubted, in regard to a large proportion at least, —its restoration to permanent pasture being now found almost impracticable.

In 1884 23,263 acres, or nearly a seventh of the whole, were under cultivation and 3228 under wood. The rotation of crops most commonly followed is a six-course shift of (1) turnips, (2) barley or oats, (3), (4), (5) grass or pasture, and (6) oats. Horses in 1884 numbered 580, cattle 2657, sheep 165,061; Till about a century ago the upper farms of the county were stocked exclusively with sheep of the blackfaced breed, and in high heathery tracts these still predominate. But as altitude diminishes sheep improve in quality, from pure Cheviot to half-bred and three-quarters-bred Leicester-Cheviot Upwards of 60,000 acres, more than a third of the county, belong to the duke of Buccleuch, whose title is derived from an ancient possession of his family in the vale of Rankleburn. Other principal landowners are Mr Maxwell-Stuart of Traquair (9765 acres) and Lord Napier and Ettrick (6988 acres).

Manufactures.— So early as the beginning of the 17th century the village of Galashiels did a considerable local trade in woollen cloth, then or shortly afterwards known as “Galashiels grey,” and towards the end of the 18th century this industry was greatly stimulated by judicious grants from “the equivalent” paid by England at the Union. About the end of the first quarter of the 19th century a few novelties in pattern (mostly accidental) led to the opening up of what has now become a vast industry—the Tweed trade, which still has its acknowledged centre in Selkirk.

Administration and Population.— Selkirkshire with Peeblesshire forms one parliamentary constituency. Of entire civil parishes it contains only two, with parts of nine others; there are also, taken from these, three quoad sacra parishes and part of a fourth. The population, 4937 in 1755 and 9809 in 1851, was in 1881 returned at 25,564,—an increase partly due to the annexation of a portion of Galashiels formerly reckoned in Roxburgh. Outside the two towns of Galashiels (population 9140 in 1881) and Selkirk population has been almost stationary for more than a century, that of the landward parishes in 1755 and 1881 being respectively as follows :—Ashkirk, 200 and 138; Innerleithen, 60 and 61; Ettrick, 397 and 397; Stow, 260 and 441; Yarrow, 1180 and 611; Roberton, 250 and 250.

Antiquities and History.— The shire is not rich in antiquities, although its hillsides here and there reveal earthen enclosures known as “British camps,” as well as tumuli yielding human remains and the usual fragments of rude pottery. A mysterious ditch, known as “the Catrail,” beginning at the north end of the county, traverses its entire extent before entering Roxburgh on its way to the English border. Besides smaller redoubts, there is on its line, at Rink in Galashiels parish, a well-preserved circular fort of formidable strength and dimensions. Near Minchmoor the Catrail is crossed by “Wallace's trench.” where, according to an historical document recently published, the Scottish patriot defied for a while the generals of Edward I. Close by is the hill-track by which Montrose escaped from the disastrous field of Philiphaugh in 1645. Newark Castle, built by James II., still stands in fair preservation, notable enough historically, but more familiar as the recital-hall of the “last minstrel’s” immortal lay. The county is dotted over with other towers of smaller size, in various stages of decay. Around them cluster those traditions which, sung in ballads full of simple force and tenderness, have made Selkirk the poet’s chosen haunt. Yarrow, “garlanded with rhyme,” has, without hyperbole, been termed “the Tempe of the West.” Selkirk was long known officially as the “shire of the Forest,” an appellation its famous sheriff Sir Walter Scott loved to recall. Except the burgh of Selkirk, its lands, and a large tract in upper Ettrick belonging to Melrose Abbey, the county remained long under the jurisdiction of a forest court, and its forest-steadings were held by tack from the crown till the time of Queen Mary. It was a favourite hunting-ground of Scottish monarchs and formed the dowry-land of at least two foreign princesses who became queens of Scotland. See T. Craig-Brown, Hist. of Selkirkshire.
