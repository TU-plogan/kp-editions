Its length is 23 miles, its greatest breadth 5 miles, and the total area 68 square miles. Mountains traverse the central part from south-east to north-west, the greatest height, Mount Misery, being about 4100 feet above sea-level. On the seaboard is Basseterre, the capital, the outlet of a fertile plain, which contains the cultivated land. The thermometer ranges from 78 to 84 Fahr.
