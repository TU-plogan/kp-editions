SALTCOATS, a seaport and watering-place of Ayrshire, Scotland, contiguous to Ardrossan, and 19 miles north of Ayr. It possesses a good sea-beach, and of late years has become a favourite watering-place. The town received a charter as a burgh of barony in 1528, but afterwards lost its privileges and fell into decay. At a very early period marine salt was manufactured, and saltpans were erected by Sir Robert Cunningham in 1656, but that industry has now ceased. A harbour was also constructed and for a considerable time there was a large shipment of coal, but the trade has now passed to Ardrossan. The population, 4624 in 1871, in 1881 was 5096.
