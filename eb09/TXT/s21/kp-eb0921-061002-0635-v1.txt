SEATTLE, county seat of King county, Washington Territory, United States, on Seattle Bay, east side of Puget Sound, with Lake Union, 3 miles long, on the north, and Lake Washington, 25 miles long, on the east, is the largest city of the Territory. A ship canal to connect these lakes with Puget Sound is now (1886) in course of construction. Seattle has shipyards, foundries, machineshops, sawmills, lumber-yards, breweries, and manufactories of furniture, carriages, cigars, crackers, patent medicines, boxes, and barrels. It possesses the Territorial university. The Columbia and Puget Sound and the Puget Sound Shore Railroads have their terminus here, whence large shipments of coal take place. The population in 1880 was 3533, and in 1885 it was estimated at 12,000.[9:21:611]
