SANDWICH, John Montagu, Fourth Earl of (1718-1792), was born 3d November 1718, and succeeded[9:21:262] his grandfather in the earldom, 20th October 1729. He was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, which he entered in 1735. After a voyage round the Mediterranean, he returned to England and began to take an active interest in politics as a supporter of Sir Robert Walpole. A clear and lucid rather than a brilliant debater, his style of address always won the attention of his audience, and his accurate knowledge secured their respect. The high opinion the Government entertained of his judgment and his diplomatic abilities was evidenced by his appointment in 1746 as plenipotentiary to the congress at Breda, which was continued till peace was negotiated at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748. On his return he became first lord of the admiralty, retaining the post until June 1751. He held the same office from 1763 to 1765, and again from 1771 till the dissolution of Lord Northâ€™s administration in 1782. He died 30th April 1792. His Voyage Pound the Mediterranean was published posthumously in 1799, accompanied with a memoir.
