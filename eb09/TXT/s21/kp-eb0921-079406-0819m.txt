SHENSTONE, William (1714-1763), is one of the best-known minor poets of the 18th century. He owes[9:21:795] such distinction as he has at least as much to his choice of subjects and to the peculiarity of his life as to the felicity of his verse. Coming after a generation whose leading poets wrote for fashionable society, he shut himself up in the country, tried to follow the life Arcadian, and wrote in the spirit of a recluse. He inherited the small estate of Leasowes, in the parish of Hales-Owen, Worcestershire. He was born at Leasowes in 1714, and after passing through Pembroke College, Oxford, retired there to realize Pope’s ideal in the Ode to Solitude, turned his paternal estate into an elaborate landscape garden, and lived there till his death in 1763. From the time that the management of the estate fell into his own hands, “he began,” Johnson says, “to point his prospects, to diversify his surface, to entangle his walks, and to wind his waters,—which he did with such judgment and such fancy as to make his little domain the envy of the great and the admiration of the skilful.” From this it will be seen that he did not anticipate late sentiment in his love of natural scenery; he was a true child of the Queen Anne time in his liking for “Nature to advantage dressed.” And it would appear from his letters that he was not a contented recluse, but was weakly desirous of the notice of the world in his Arcadian retreat. Still there is a certain air of sincerity in his references to natural beauty and grandeur. Burns wrote of him in the preface to his first issue of poems as a poet “whose divine elegies do honour to our language.” Shenstone practised the elegiac form assiduously, and some of his elegies are not without a certain imposing pomp and dignity of language, but we may safely suppose that it was the sentiments rather than the expression that captivated the peasant poet. His Pastoral Ballads in Four Parts, one of his earliest compositions, is also one of his best, and from its use in selections of poetry for the young is much more generally known. The triple rhythm and the simplicity of the language are happily suited to the pastoral fancy, and there is not too much of the artificial diction and imagery of such poetry. Such lines as—

Yet time may diminish the pain;

The flower, and the shrub, and the tree

"Which I rear’d for her pleasure in vain In time may have comfort for me—

come nearer Wordsworth’s ideal of poetic diction than was common in the serious poetry of Shenstone’s time. But his Schoolmistress, in the Spenserian stanza (published in 1742, and so relieved from any suspicion of being an imitation of Thomson), is the poem by which he keeps a place in literature.
