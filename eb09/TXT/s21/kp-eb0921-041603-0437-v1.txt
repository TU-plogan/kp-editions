SCHMALKALDEN, a town of Prussia, in the province of Hesse-Nassau, lies about 30 miles to the southwest of Erfurt, and in 1885 contained 6788 inhabitants, chiefly employed in the manufacture of hardware articles. It still possesses the inn in which the important Protestant League of Schmalkalden or Smalkald was concluded in 1531, and also the house in which the articles were drawn up in 1537 by Luther, Melanchthon, and other Reformers. See Germany, vol. x. p. 498, and Luther, vol. XV. p. 83.
