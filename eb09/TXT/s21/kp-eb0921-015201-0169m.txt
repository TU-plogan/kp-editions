SAHARANPUR, principal town and administrative headquarters of the above district, is situated in 29° 58' 15' N. lat. and 77° 35' 15" E. long., on a small stream (the Damaula Nadi) in an open level country. Its height above the sea is over 900 feet. The town possesses a fine botanic garden, where early experiments were made in tea and cinchona culture. Amongst its buildings are an old Rohilla fort, used as a court-house, and a handsome Mohammedan mosque. A considerable trade is carried on in grain, sugar, molasses, and country cloth. The population in 1881 was 59,194 (31,506 males and 27,688 females).
