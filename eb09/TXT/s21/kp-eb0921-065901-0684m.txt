SENECA FALLS, a post village and township of the United States, in Seneca county, New York, 41 miles south-west of Syracuse by the Auburn division of the New York Central Railroad, occupies a beautiful situation on Seneca river, the outlet of Seneca Lake. It turns the water-power of the falls to account in the manufacture of steam fire-engines, fire-extinguishing apparatus, pumps, machinery, knit goods, flour, yeast, &c. The population of the village was 5880 in 1880 and of the township 6853.
