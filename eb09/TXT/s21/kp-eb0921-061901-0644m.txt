SEDALIA, a city of the United States, county town of Pettis county, Missouri, lies 189 miles west of St Louis, on the highest swell of a rolling prairie, which drains by small streams north-east to the Missouri. It is a railroad centre, and, besides the machine-shops and carriage-factories of two railway companies (the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas, and the Missouri Pacific, Middle Division), it contains foundries, flour-mills, and establishments for the manufacture of furniture, woollen goods, soap, beer, Ac. Among the public buildings are two opera-houses, a public library, a high school, and a gymnasium. Founded in 1860 by General George R. Smith, Sedalia had 4560 inhabitants in 1870, and 9561 in 1880.
