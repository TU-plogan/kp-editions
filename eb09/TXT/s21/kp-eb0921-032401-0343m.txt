SAUSSURE, Nicolas Théodore de (1767-1845), eldest son of Horace Benedict de Saussure, was born on October 14, 1767, at Geneva, and is known chiefly for his work on the chemistry of vegetable physiology. He was a shy man, who lived quietly and avoided society; yet like his ancestors he was a member of the Genevan representative council, and gave much attention and thought to public affairs. He took a deep interest in the improvement of education, but deprecated the introduction of science teaching into schools, on the ground that it would divert the children’s minds from the study of the classical languages and mathematics. He latterly became more of a recluse than ever, and died in April 1845.

When a young man Nicolas Theodore accompanied his father in the Alpine journeys and assisted him by the careful determination of many physical constants. He was attracted to chemistry by Lavoisier’s brilliant conceptions, but he did not become great as an originator. He took a leading share in the rapid succession of improvements which rendered the processes of ultimate organic analysis trustworthy. He fixed the composition of ethylic alcohol, ether, and some other commonly occurring substances, thereby advancing the knowledge of pure chemistry. He also studied fermentation, the conversion of starch into sugar, and many other processes of minor importance. The greater number of his 36 published papers deal with the chemistry and physiology of plants, the nature of soils, and the conditions of vegetable life. These were published under the title Recherches Chimiques sur la Végétation, and were acknowledged to display remarkable ability.
