SAUMUR, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Maine-et-Loire, is situated on an island and on the left bank of the Loire, 38 miles south-west of Tours, and 27 miles south-east of Angers. A large metal bridge connects the Tours-Angers railway with that of Montreuil-Bellay by which Saumur communicates with Poitiers and Niort. Two stone bridges (755 and 905 feet long) also unite the town on the island with the two banks of the river. Several of the Saumur churches are interesting. St Pierre, of the 12th century, has a 17th-century façade and a Renaissance nave; and Notre Dame of Nantilly (often visited by Louis XI.) has a remarkable though greatly damaged façade, a doorway and choir of the 12th century, and a nave of the 11th. Both these churches contain curious tapestries, and in the latter, fixed in the wall, is the copper cross of Gilles de Tyr, keeper of the seals to St Louis. St Jean is a charming little building in the Angevine Gothic style. Notre Dame of Ardiliers, of the 16th century, was enlarged in the following century by Richelieu and Madame de Montespan. The town-house is an elegant 16th-century edifice; and the whole town is rich in graceful and interesting examples of the best period of French domestic architecture. The castle, built between the 11th century and the 13th, and remodelled in the 16th, is used as an arsenal and powder magazine. There is also an interesting almshouse, with its chambers in part dug out in the rock. The cavalry school, founded in 1768, and after various interruptions reorganized in 1824 and 1853, has at the present time (1886) 400 pupils, of whom 125 are officers. Other establishments are a public library, a museum of natural history and local Roman and Celtic antiquities, a horticultural garden, with a school of vines in which eight hundred kinds of grapes are cultivated. Saumur carries on a large trade in sparkling white wines grown in the neighbourhood, as well as in brandy, grain, flax, and hemp; and it manufactures enamels and rosaries. The population in 1881 was 13,439 (14,186 in the commune).

The Saumur caves along the Loire and on both sides of the valley of the Thouet (a left-hand tributary) must have been occupied at a very remote period. The Tour du Trone (9th century) served as a place of refuge for the inhabitants of the surrounding district during foreign invasions, and became the nucleus of a monastery built by monks escaped from St Florent le Vieil. On the same site rose the castle of Saumur two hundred years later. The town fell into the hands of Foulques Nerra, duke of Anjou, in 1025, and[9:21:323] passed in the 13th century into the possession of the kings of France, to whom it remained constantly faithful. The English failed to capture it during all the course of the Hundred Years’ War. After the Reformation the town became the metropolis of Protestantism in France and the seat of a theological seminary, illustrated by many distinguished names. The school of Saumur, as opposed to that of Sedan, represented the more liberal side of French Protestantism (Cameron, Amyraut, &c. ). In 1623 the fortifications were dismantled; and the revocation of the edict of Nantes reduced the population from 25,000 to 6000.
