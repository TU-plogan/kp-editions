SAMUEL Shĕmūēl),^[1. This is one of an obscure class of proper names &c.), the analogy of which seems to exclude the idea that it is softened from “heard of God.” It seems rather to mean “name of El,” i.e., “manifestation of God’s power or will.” Compare the title Shem Baal, “name of Baal,” given to Astarte on the epitaph of Eshmunazar. ] a seer and “judge” of

Israel in the time of the Philistine oppression. His history, as told in the first book of Samuel (compare Psalm xcix. 5; Ecclus. xlvi. 13 sq.), is too familiar to call for repetition here, and a critical estimate of his place in Hebrew history has been given in Israel, vol. xiii. p. 403. There remain, however, one or two points of detail which may be noticed here. His birthplace was Ramah, or, as it is called in the Hebrew text of 1 Sam. i. 1, Ha-Ramathaim (Ramathem, 1 Macc. xi. 34; Arimathaea, Mat. xxvii. 57); the identity of the two names is supported by the Septuagint, which has Arimathaim for Ramah in several passages. Ramah, which appears in 1 Kings xv. 17 as a stronghold on the frontier of the kingdoms of Ephraim and Judah, is probably identical with the modern El-Râm, about 5 miles north of Jerusalem, on a hill on the east side of the main road to Shechem and the north. Ramah was also the place where Samuel usually resided in his later days, and from which he made a yearly circuit through a very limited district in the immediate neighbourhood, “judging Israel” (1 Sam. vii. 16). None of the cities which he visited is more than a few miles from Ramah. Ramah, according to 1 Sam. i. 1 (where the text is to be corrected by the Septuagint), was a town in the district of Zuph, belonging to the tribe of Ephraim (comp. 1 Sam. ix. 5 and 1 Sam. x. 2, where the grave of Rachel lies on the frontier between Ephraim and Benjamin; a different localization is given in Gen. xxxv. 19, 20, unless the identification of Bethlehem and Ephrath there is a later gloss). The original text of 1 Sam. i. 1 does not seem to say explicitly that Samuel’s father was an Ephrathite (i.e., of the tribe of Ephraim), though his city was Ephrathite; and 1 Chron. vi. 28, 33 [vi. 13, 18] makes him a Levite, apparently because a post-exile family of singers traced their stock from him. The old accounts certainly represent Samuel even as a child as doing priestly service at Shiloh, girt with the ephod and wearing the priestly robe (mĕ'îl, E. V. “coat,” 1 Sam. ii. 18 sq.), but at that early date priesthood was by no means confined to Levites, and the story certainly implies that it was not by birth but only by his mother’s vow that he was dedicated to the service of the sanctuary. On Samuel’s relation to the prophets, see vol. xix. p. 815. Compare also Samuel, Books of.
