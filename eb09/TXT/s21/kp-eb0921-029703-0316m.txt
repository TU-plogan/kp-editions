SANTANDER, a province in the north of Spain, on the shores of the Bay of Biscay, bounded on the E. by Biscaya, on the S. by Burgos and Palencia, and on the W. by Leon and Oviedo. The area is 2113 square miles. The province is mountainous in character, being traversed from east to west by the Cantabrian chain, which in the Picos de Europa reaches a height of over 8700 feet, and sends off numerous branches to the sea. On the north side of the range the streams are all short, the principal being the Ason, the Miera, the Pas, the Besaya, the Soja, and the Nansa, which flow into the Bay of Biscay; part of the province lies to the southward of the watershed, and is drained by the upper Ebro. The valleys of Santander are fertile, and produce various kinds of grain, maize, pulse, hemp, flax, and vegetables. Oranges, lemons, grapes, figs, and other fruits flourish, and forests of oak, chestnut, walnut, and fir cover the hills. Rich pasturage for cattle and swine and a good supply of game are also found among them, and the fisheries along the coast are likewise productive. Foreign capital has been successfully applied to the development of lead, coal, and iron mines; and the mountains contain quarries of limestone, marble, and gypsum, and abound with mineral springs. The district was part of the Roman province of Cantabria, which, after passing under the empire of the Goths, became the principality of the Asturias. The portion called Asturia de Santa Juliana, or Santillana, was included in the kingdom of Old Castile, and, on the subdivision of the old provinces of Spain in 1833, became the province of Santander. The people are of a purer race than in parts of Spain subjected by the Moors, and both in mental and physical qualities show their Teutonic ancestry. The industries of the country are consequently in a flourishing condition, and, besides the natural products above mentioned, there are foundries, breweries, distilleries, tanneries; cotton, linen, cloth, and flour mills; brick and tile works; and manufactories of hats, soap, buttons, preserves, and chocolate. The province is traversed from north to south by the railway and high road from Santander by Palencia to Madrid; the highest point on the railway (Venta de Pazozal) is 3229 feet above the sea. For purposes of administration the province is divided into eleven partidos judiciales, containing 103 ayuntamientos, and returns two senators and five deputies to the cortes. The population in 1877 numbered 235,299, Besides Santander, the capital, the only places having within the municipal boundaries a population exceeding 5000 are Castro-Urdidles (7623), Valle de Pielagos (5500), Torrelavega (7192), and Valderredible (7240). Santo√±a has 4428, and Laredo 4384. Santillana (1776) has a fine Roman[9:21:298] esque church and cloister (12th century), and was the birthplace of the architect Juan de Herrera.
