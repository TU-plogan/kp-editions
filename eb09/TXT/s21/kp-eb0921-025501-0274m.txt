SANCHEZ. Three persons of this name once enjoyed considerable literary celebrity:â€”(1) Francisco Sanchez (Sanctius) (1523-1601), successively professor of Greek and of rhetoric at Salamanca, whose Minerva, first printed at that town in 1587, was long the standard work on Latin grammar; (2) Francisco Sanchez, a Portuguese physician of Jewish parentage, professor of philosophy and physic at Toulouse, where he died at the age of seventy in 1632, whose ingenious but sophistical writings (Quod nihil scitur, 1581) mark the high-water of reaction against the dogmatism of the traditional schools of his time; (3) Thomas Sanchez of Cordova (1551-1610), Jesuit and casuist, whose treatise De Matrimonio (Genoa, 1592) is more notorious for its repulsive features than celebrated for its real learning and ability.
