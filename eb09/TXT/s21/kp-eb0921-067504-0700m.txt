SERGHIEVSKIY POSAD, or Troitze-Serghievsk, a town of Russia, in the government of Moscow, which has grown up round the monastery of Troitze-Serghievskaya Lavra, 44 miles by rail to the north-east of Moscow. It is situated in a beautiful country, intersected by pleasant little valleys and varied with woods, the buildings extending partly over the hill occupied by the monastery and partly over the valley below. Including the extensive Kukuevsk suburbs, it had in 1884 31,400 inhabitants. There are several lower-grade schools, an infirmary for old women, and a school for girls. Numerous inns and hotels, some maintained by the monastery and others a rich source of revenue to it, accommodate the numerous pilgrims.[9:21:676] Serghievsk has long been renowned for its manufactures of holy pictures (painted and carved), spoons, and a variety of other articles carved in wood, especially toys, sold to pilgrims. Within the last twenty years this industry has greatly developed; separate parts of certain toys are made elsewhere and brought to Serghievsk, where no fewer than 330 workshops, employing 1055 hands, with an annual production valued at more than £30,000, supply the finished article. Several other petty industries are carried on both in the town and in the neighbouring villages.

The Troitsk monastery is the most sacred place in middle Russia, the Great Russians regarding it with more veneration than even the cathedrals and relics of the Kremlin of Moscow. It occupies a picturesque site on the top of a hill, protected on two sides by deep ravines and steep slopes. The walls, 25 to 50 feet in height, are fortified by nine towers, one of which, the Pyatnitsk, has been for some time a prison for both civil and ecclesiastical offenders. Eleven churches, including the Troitskiy (Trinity) and Uspenskiy cathedrals, a lofty bell-tower, a theological academy, various buildings for monks and pilgrims, and a hospital stand within the precincts, which are nearly two-thirds of a mile in circuit. A small wooden church, erected by the monk Sergius, and afterwards burned by the Tatars, stood on the site now occupied by the cathedral of the Trinity, which was built in 1422, and contains the relics of Sergius, as well as a holy picture which has frequently been brought into requisition in Russian campaigns. The Uspenskiy cathedral was erected in 1585; close beside it are the graves of Boris Godunoff and his family. In the southern part of the monastery is the church of Sergius, beneath which are spacious rooms where 200,000 dinners are distributed gratis every year to the pilgrims. The bell-tower, 290 feet high, has a bell weighing 137 1/2 tons. Several monasteries of less importance occur in the neighbourhood. The site now occupied by the Troitsk monastery was in the 14th century covered with impenetrable forests. In 1337 two brothers, Barthelemy and Stefan, sons of a Rostoff boiar, erected a church on the spot. The elder (born in 1314) took monastic orders under the name of Sergius, erected cells by the church, and became widely famous among the peasants around. The Moscow princes also showed great respect for the chief of the new monastery. Dmitri Joannovich Donskoi received the benediction of Sergius before setting out on the Tatar expedition which terminated in the victory of Kulikovo, and afterwards accepted the advice and help of the monk in his dealings with the prince of Ryazan. Sergius lived a life of diligence and simplicity, and declined to accept the office of metropolitan of Moscow. His monastery acquired great fame and became the wealthiest in middle Russia. Ivan the Terrible in 1561 made it the centre of the ecclesiastical province of Moscow. During the Polish invasion at the beginning of the 17th century it organized the national resistance, and supplied the combatants with money and food. In 1608-9 it withstood a sixteen months’ siege by the Poles; at a later date the monks took a lively part in the organization of the army which crushed the outbreak of the peasants. In 1683 and 1689 Peter I. took refuge here from the revolted streltzi. The theological seminary, founded in 1744 and transformed in 1814 into an academy, reckons Platon and Philarete among its pupils.
