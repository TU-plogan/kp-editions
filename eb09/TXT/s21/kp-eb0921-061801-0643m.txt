SECULAR GAMES were celebrated at Rome for three days and nights with great ceremony to mark the commencement of a new saeculuvi or generation. Originally they were a propitiatory festival, imported from Etruria under the name of Ludi Terentini, and held at irregular intervals, in view of extraordinary prodigies; but in 249 b.c. it was decreed that they should be celebrated in every hundredth year after that date. This decree was frequently disregarded, partly for political reasons and partly because in Augustus’s time and with his approval the quindecemviri, acting under Greek influence, sanctioned the longer period of 110 years.

The dates of the actual celebrations are as follows :—the first in 509 B.C., the second in 348, the third in 249, the fourth in 146, the fifth by Augustus in 17 (for this occasion Horace wrote his Carmen Sseculare), the sixth by Claudius in 47 a.d. =800 a. u. c ., the seventh by Domitian in 88, the eighth by Antoninus Pius in 147 = 900 a. u. c ., the ninth by Severus in 204 (220 years after the Augustan celebration), the tenth by Philip in 248, the eleventh and last by Gallienus c. 262. The projected celebration of Maximian in 304 did not take place.

Censorinus, De Die Natali, c. 17; Zosimus, ii. 1 sq.; Val. Max., ii. c. 5. The dates of the first two celebrations appear to rest only on the authority of Valerius Antias; the others are certain. The quindecemviral books assigned fictitious dates for the pre-Augustan celebrations. Comp. Marquardt, Die römische Staatsverwaltung, iii. p. 369 sq.
