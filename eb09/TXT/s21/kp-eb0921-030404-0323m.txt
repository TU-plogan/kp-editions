SÁRAN, or Sarun, a British district in the lieutenantgovernorship of Bengal, lying between 25° 40' and 26° 38' N. lat. and 83° 58' and 85° 14' E. long. It forms one of the north-western districts of the Patná division in the Behar province, and comprises an area of 2622 square miles. Sáran is bounded on the north by the district of Gorakhpur in the North-Western Provinces, on the east by the Bengal districts of Champáran and Tirhut, on the south by the Ganges, separating it from Sháhábád and Patná districts, and on the west by Gorakhpur. It is a vast alluvial plain, possessing no mountains, and scarcely any hill or even undulations, but with a general inclination towards the south-east, as indicated by the flow of the rivers in that direction. The rivers and watercourses are very numerous, few tracts being better supplied in this respect. The principal rivers besides the Ganges are the Gandak and Ghagrá, which are navigable throughout the year. There is little or no waste land, and the district has long been noted for the high state of its cultivation. Sáran is beautifully wooded; mango trees are very numerous; and it yields large crops of rice, besides other cereals, tobacco, opium, indigo, cotton, and sugar-cane. Though possessing no railways or canals, the district is well provided with roads. There is very little jungle; large game is not met with, but snakes are very numerous. Sáran is subject to blight, flood, and drought; its average annual rainfall is 45 inches. The administrative headquarters are at Chhapra.

The census of 1881 returned the population at 2,280,382 (1,083,565 males and 1,196,817 females); Hindus numbered 2,010,958, Mohammedans 269,142, and Christians 282. The population is entirely agricultural; there are only three towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants, viz., Chhapra (51,670), Sewan (13,319), and Revelganj (12,493). Manufactures are few and of little account; the principal are indigo, sugar, brass-work, pottery, saltpetre, and cloth. The commerce of Saran consists chiefly in the export of raw produce, of which the chief articles are oil-seeds, indigo, sugar, and grain of all sorts except rice; the imports consist principally of rice, salt, and European piece-goods. Revelganj is the chief trading mart. The gross revenue of the district in 1883-84 amounted to .£203,734, of which the land contributed £122,612, Saran formerly constituted one district with Champáran. The revenue areas of the two districts were not finally separated until 1866, but the magisterial jurisdictions were first divided in 1837.
