SHIMOGA, or Sheemoga, a district in the north-west of the native state of Mysore, Southern India. It forms a part of the Nagar division, and is situated between 13° 30' and 14° 38' N. lat. and between 74° 44' and 76° 5' E. long. It has an area of 3797 square miles, and is bounded on the N. and W. by the Bombay districts of Dhárwár and N. Kánara, and E. and S. by the districts of Chitaldroog and Kadur. Its river system is twofold; in the east the Tungra, Bhadra, and Varada unite to form the Tungabhadra, which ultimately falls into the Kistna and so into the Bay of Bengal, while in the west a few minor streams flow to the Shirávati, which near the north-western frontier bursts through the Western GhAts by the celebrated Falls of Gersoppa, said to be the grandest cataract in India. Flowing over a rocky bed 250 yards wide, the river here throws itself in four distinct falls down a tremendous chasm 960 feet deep.

The western half of the district is very mountainous and covered with magnificent forest, and is known as the Malnád or hill country, some of the peaks being 4000 feet above sea-level. The general elevation of Shimoga is about 2000 feet; and towards the east it opens out into the Maidán or plain country, which forms part of the general plateau of Mysore; The Malnád region is very picturesque, its scenery abounding with every charm of tropical forests and mountain wilds; on the other hand the features of the Maidán country are for the most part comparatively tame. The mineral products of the district include iron-ore aud laterite. On the summits of the Ghats stones possessing magnetic qualities are occasionally found. The soil is loose and sandy in the valleys of the Malnád, and in the north-east the black cotton soil prevails. Bison are common in the talúk of Sagar, where also wild elephants are occasionally seen; λvhile tigers, leopards, bears, wild hogs, sámbhar and chitál deer, and jungle sheep are numerous in the wooded tracts of the west. Shimoga presents much variety of climate. The south-west monsoon is felt in full force for about 25 miles from the Ghats, bringing an annual rainfall of more than 150 inches, but the rainfall gradually diminishes to 31 inches at Shimoga station and to 25 inches or less at Chennagiri. There is no railroad in the district, but it contains 225 miles of roads.

The population in 1881 was 499,728 (males 259,296, females 240,432); Hindus numbered 470,678, Mohammedans 27,574, and Christians 1476. The only place with more than 10,000 inhabitants is Shimoga town, the capital and headquarters, which is situated on the Tunga river, with a population of 12,040. Rice[9:21:804] is the staple food-crop of the district; the next in importance is sugar-cane; areca-nuts are also extensively grown; and miscellaneous crops include oil-seeds, vegetables, fruits, pepper, and cardamoms. Of the total area of 3797 square miles only 699 are returned as cultivated and 702 as cultivable. The chief manufactures are coarse cotton cloths, rough country blankets or kamblis, iron implements, brass and copper wares, pottery, and jaggery. The district is also noted for its beautiful sandal-wood carving.

During the Mohammedan usurpation of Mysore from 1761 to 1799, unceasing warfare kept the whole country in constant turmoil. After the restoration of the Hindu dynasty Shimoga district repeatedly became the scene of disturbances caused by the maladministration of the Deshasta Bráhmans, who had seized upon every office and made themselves thoroughly obnoxious. These disturbances culminated in the insurrection of 1830, which led to the direct assumption of the entire state by the British.
