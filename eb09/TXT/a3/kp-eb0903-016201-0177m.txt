AXMINSTER, a market-town of England, in the county of Devon, 147 miles from London, and 24 from Exeter. It takes its name from the River Axe, on which it stands. The ancient abbey-church, or minster, which adorns the centre of the town, was built by King Athelstan to commemorate a victory over the Danes. The town was formerly distinguished for its production of the best and most costly description of carpets; and it still manufactures broad and narrow cloths, cotton, leather, gloves, tapes, and druggets. Dr Buckland was a native of the town. Population of the parish in 1871, 2861.
