ATHIAS, Joseph, a celebrated rabbi and printer at Amsterdam, whose editions of the Hebrew Bible are noted for the general correctness of the text. Although he was a learned Hebraist, there are occasional errors in the points, especially in the edition of 1661, but many of these were corrected in that of 1667. He also printed several editions of the Bible in the corrupted Hebrew spoken by the Jews of Spain, Germany, Poland, and England. He died in 1700.
