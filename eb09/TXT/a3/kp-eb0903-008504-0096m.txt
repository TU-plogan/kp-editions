AULIS, a town in Boeotia, supposed to have been situated on a rocky peninsula between two bays, about three miles S. of Chalcis. During the Trojan war it was the rendezvous of the Greek fleet, and has obtained celebrity as the scene of the sacrifice of Iphigenia. Pausanias states that in his day there was still to be seen here the temple of Artemis ascribed to Agamemnon.
