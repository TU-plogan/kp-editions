AUDOUIN, Jean Victor, a distinguished French entomologist, was born at Paris, April 27, 1797. He began the study of law, but was diverted from it by his strong predilection for natural history, which subsequently led him to enter the medical profession. In 1824 he w as appointed assistant to Latreille in the entomological chair at the Paris museum of natural history, and succeeded him in 1833. He established in 1824, in conjunction with Dumas and Adolphe Brongniart, the Annales des Sciences Naturelles, to which he made numerous valuable contributions, generally in co-operation with Μ. Milne-Edwards. The greater part of his other papers are contained in the Transactions of the Entomological Society, of which he was one of the founders, and for many years president. In 1838 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences. He died in 1841, more from the effects of mental than of bodily exhaustion. His principal work, Histoire des Insectes nuisibles à la Vigne, was continued after his death by Milne-Edwards and Blanchard, and published in 1842.
