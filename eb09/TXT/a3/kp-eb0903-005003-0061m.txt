ATRI or Atria, the ancient Hadria, a town of Naples, in the province of Abruzzo Ulteriore I., situated on a steep mountain 5 miles from the Adriatic, and 18 miles S.E. of Teramo. It is the see of a bishop, and has a cathedral, a parish church, and several convents and hospitals. It contains 9877 inhabitants. Remains of the ancient city have been discovered to the S. of the present site, consisting of the ruins of a theatre and baths, with pavements, and vases of Greek manufacture. It was a very flourishing commercial port at an early period, but had declined into a small town in the time of Strabo. It3 modern revival has been furthered by the excavation of new canals.
