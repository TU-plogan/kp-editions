AUBUSSON, a town of France, situated in a picturesque valley on the banks of the Creuse, in the department to which that river gives its name. It is said to have owed its origin to a number of Saracens, who, having escaped from the battle in which their nation was defeated by Charle3 Martel, were enticed by the beauty and convenience of th j spot to establish themselves permanently there. It I1a3 long been famous for its carpets and tapestry, the art of weaving which was probably derived from those Eastern settlers, and it also manufactures common cotton and woollen goods, leather, tobacco, &c. Population, 6625.
