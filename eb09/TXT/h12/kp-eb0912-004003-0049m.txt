HODGE, Charles (1797-1878), theologian, was born in Philadelphia, December 28, 1797. He was educated at the college of New Jersey in Princeton, where he graduated in 1815, and afterwards at the theological seminary of the Presbyterian Church in the same place, where he continued a student until 1819; in 1820 he became assistant teacher; and in 1822 he was chosen by the general assembly to be professor of Oriental and Biblical literature there. He spent two years on the Continent, from 1826 to 1828, studying under De Sacy in Paris, under Gesenius and Tholuck in Halle, and under Hengstenberg, Neander, and Humboldt in Berlin. In 1840 he was transferred to the chair of [9:12:41] didactic and exegetical theology, to which subjects that of polemic theology was added in 1852, and this office he held to the day of his death. In 1825 he established a quarterly publication entitled the Biblical Repertory, designed to furnish translations and reprints of the best contemporaneous foreign essays on theological and religious subjects. On his return from Europe in 1828 he changed it into a vehicle for publishing original theological essays and reviews, and added the words Princeton Review to its title. He secured for it the position of theological organ of the old school division of the Presbyterian Church, and continued its principal editor and contributor until 1868. He contributed over 130 articles on subjects ranging through every department of theology and ecclesiology, and all the great practical, ecclesiastical, moral, and national questions of the day. From 1835 to 1868 he wrote yearly an article reviewing the action of each general assembly, which series has exerted a powerful influence over the current opinion and history of the church to which he belonged. The most important of these have been republished in Great Britain and in America, in volumes, under the titles of Hodge’s Essays, Princeton Theological Essays, and Hodge’s Church Polity. He was made doctor of divinity by Rutgers College, N.J., in 1834, moderator of the general assembly (O.S.) in 1846, member of the committee to revise the Book of Discipline of the Presbyterian Church in 1858, and LL.D, by Washington College, Pa., in 1864. April 24, 1872, the fiftieth anniversary of his election to his professorship, was observed in Princeton as his jubilee by between 400 and 500 representatives of his 3000 pupils, when he received congratulatory addresses and letters from all the Presbyterian theological faculties of Scotland and Ireland, and from a majority of those belonging to the various Evangelical churches of America. He continued to instruct his classes uninterruptedly up to the time of his death in Princeton, June 19, 1878. The main characteristics of Hodge were strength and persistence of conviction and of purpose, logical clearness and symmetry of thought and style, energy and effective vigour in the defence of his convictions and in assaults upon what he considered error, sunny cheerfulness of disposition, and humility, tenderness, and gentleness of heart and manner.

Besides his articles in the Princeton Review, he published a Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans, Phila., 1835, abridged 1836, rewritten and enlarged 1866; Constitutional History of the Presbyterian Church in the United States, 2 vols., 1840-41; The Way of Life, 1842; Commentaries on Ephesians, 1856, 1 Corinthians, 1857, 2 Corinthians, 1860; Systematic Theology, probably the best of all modern expositions of Calvinistic dogmatic, 3 vols., 2200 pp., 1871 — 73; What is Darwinism ? 1874; and there have been published since his death Hodge's Church Polity, 1878, and Conference Papers, 1879.
