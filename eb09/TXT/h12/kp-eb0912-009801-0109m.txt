HOLLAND, or Holland and West Friesl and, was the second province of the republic of the United Netherlands, and consisted of the old countship of Holland, with the addition of the lordship of Voorne. In 1801, after the erection of the Batavian republic, very nearly the same area was included in the “department” of Holland; but when in June 1806 Holland became the name of the new kingdom, it ceased to be applied to any of the administrative divisions. On the establishment of the kingdom of the Netherlands in 1814 the province of Holland was restored, with its ancient limits only slightly modified. A few further alterations were made in 1815, 1819, and 1820. It was the only province that had two governors, one for the north and another for the south, and the provincial states met alternately at the Hague and at Haarlem. In 1840 this bipartite arrangement was carried to its logical conclusion by the erection of two distinct provinces called respectively North and South Holland.

1. North Holland (Hoordholland), the fourth province of the kingdom of the Netherlands, lies between the German Ocean and the Zuyder Zee, and on the land side is bounded by the provinces of South Holland and Utrecht. The area—which in 1855 was increased by the commune of Haarlemmermeer, and in 1864 was diminished by the larger part of Leimuiden—is estimated at 744,554 acres, exclusive of the newly won lands of the Y. The amount of available ground has been augmented by the draining not only of the Haarlemmermeer but also of more than a score of lesser lakes. In 1840 the population was returned at 443,334, in 1850 at 477,079, in 1860 at 521,125, and in 1875 at 620,890. In 1870, when the total was 577,436, there were 382,607 Protestants, 157,971 Roman Catholics, 2723 Old Catholics, and 32,953 Jews. Amsterdam is the largest city, with a population in 1876 of 296,200; and next in order as communes follow Haarlem, 34.797; Helder, 22,030; Haarlemmermeer, 13,171; Zaandam, 12,772; Alkmaar, 12,245; Nieuweramstel, 11,502; Hoorn, 9763; Hilversum, 7805; Texel, 6383; Enkhuizen, 5560; and Edam, 5361. There are besides 36 communes with more than 2000 inhabitants.

2. South Holland (^Zuidholland) is the third province of the kingdom of the Netherlands. On the W. it is bounded by the German Ocean, on the N. by North Holland, on the E. by Utrecht and Guelderland, on the S.E. by North Brabant, and on the S. by Zealand. The area is estimated at 823,851 acres. In 1850 the population was returned at 564,000, in 1860 at 617,699, and in 1876 at 748,162. In 1870, when the total was 688,254, there were 508,132 Protestants, 166,219 Roman Catholics, and 12,152 Jews. The largest city is Rotterdam, with a population in 1876 of 136,230; and next in order as communes follow the Hague, 104,095; Leyden, 41,298; Dort. 26,576; Delft, 24,511; Schiedam, 21,880; Gouda, 17,070; Krälingen, 10,313; Delfshaven, 10,042; and Gorinchem, 9301. There are besides 74 communes with more than 2000 inhabitants.
