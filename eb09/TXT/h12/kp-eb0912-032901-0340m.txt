HUCBALD (also called Hugbaldus and Hubaldus) was born in or about 840, if we may believe the statement of his biographers to the effect that he died in 930, aged 90. Of his life little is known; not even the place of his birth can be ascertained, but he was no doubt a Frenchman or a Belgian. It is certain that he studied at the convent of St Amand in French Flanders, where his uncle Milo occupied an important position. Hucbald made rapid progress in the acquirement of various sciences and arts, including that of music, and at an early age composed a hymn in honour of St Andrew, which met with such success as to excite the jealousy of his uncle. It is said that Hucbald in consequence was compelled to leave St Amand, and started an independent school of music and other arts at Nevers. In 860, however, we find him at St Germain d’Auxerre, bent upon completing his studies, and in 872 he is back again at St Amand as the successor in the headmastership of the convent school of his uncle, to whom he had been reconciled in the meantime. Between 883 and 900 Hucbald went on several missions of reforming and reconstructing various schools of music, including that of Rheims, but in the latter year he returned to St Amand, where he remained to the day of his death (June 25, 930, or, according to other chroniclers, June 20, 932), and where his most important works on music were written. Of the character of these works and of the reforms and improvements advocated by them it is not easy to give a correct idea; not even their number is sufficiently certain, for some treatises have been attributed to Hucbald which are obviously not his, and others of which the authorship is at least doubtful. His largest and most authentic work is the Enchiridion Musicae, published with other writings of minor importance in the first volume of Gerber’s Scriptores ecclesiastici, and containing a complete system of musical science as well as instructions regarding notation. Hucbald as a musical theorist may be called a precursor of Guido d’Arezzo, to whose hexachord system his tetrachord, that is, the use of four instead of seven letters, forms a kind of basis. His scales are founded on strictly Greek principles, and cannot be said to mark a decided step in advance; neither is his system of notation much superior to the earlier ones, although here also he seems in a manner to foreshadow Guido’s use of the linesand spaces of the staff from which the modern method took its rise. Of great importance is the 13 th chapter of the Enchiridion, which treats of the diaphony or organum,—in other words, of singing in parts. Amongst other prescriptions it is curious to find the rule which recommends the use of parallel fifths and fourths, so strictly prohibited by later theorists, while, on the other hand, consecutive thirds, particularly euphonious to the modern ear, are excluded by Hucbald.

A good account of the monk of St Amand and his system will be found in Coussemaker’s Mémoire sur Hucbald, Paris, 1841; Hawkins (History, vol. i. p. 153) also gives a short notice of Hucbald, and mentions two epitaphs written in his honour by contemporaries.
