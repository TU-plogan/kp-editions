HUME, Joseph (1777-1855), an eminent political reformer, was born in January 1777, of humble parents, at Montrose, Scotland. After completing his course of medical study at the university of Edinburgh he sailed in 1797 for India, where he was attached as surgeon to a regiment; and his knowledge of the native tongues and his capacity for business threw open to him the lucrative offices of interpreter and commissary-general. On the [9:12:356] eve of Lord Lakeâ€™s Mahratta war in 1803 his chemical knowledge enabled him to render a signal service to the administration by making available a large quantity of gunpowder which damp had spoiled. In 1808, on the restoration of peace, he resigned all his civil appointments, and returned home in the prime of life, and in the possession of a well-earned fortune. His first care on arriving in England was to study thoroughly the country and its resources, for which purpose he made various journeys, to see the actual state of the people and the practical operation of the laws. In 1812 he took his seat for the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe-Regis; but he was soon obliged to resign it, when it was discovered by his Tory patron that he had had the audacity to talk of reform. Six years elapsed before he again entered the House, and during that interval he had made the acquaintance and imbibed the doctrines of James Mill and the philosophical reformers of the school of Bentham. He had joined his efforts to those of Mr Place, of Westminister, and other philanthropists, to relieve and improve the condition of the working classes, labouring especially to establish schools for them on the Lancasterian system, and promoting the formation of savings banks. In 1818, soon after his marriage with Miss Burnley, the daughter of an East India director, he was returned to parliament as member for the Aberdeen burghs. He was afterwards successively elected for Middlesex (1830), Kilkenny (1837), and for the Montrose burghs (1842), in the service of which constituency he died. From the date of his re-entering the House Hume began, unaided and alone, that course of reform in which he persevered to his death. He became the self-elected guardian of the public purse, withstanding every abuse of the public money, by challenging and bringing to a direct vote every single item of public expenditure. The difficulties Hume encountered in the course of his efforts to reduce the enormous burden of taxation under which the country groaned were aggravated by the confused state of the public accounts. But no obstacle daunted or discouraged him in his enlightened efforts as the pioneer of commercial, financial, and parliamentary reform. Other labours with which his name is connected deserve to be recorded. He unravelled the Orange Lodge conspiracy, the ramifications of which spread over England, Scotland, and the colonies, and the object of which was to make the duke of Cumberland king in place of William IV. He carried on a successful warfare against the old combination laws that hampered workmen and favoured masters; he brought about the repeal of the laws prohibiting the export of machinery and of the Act preventing workmen from going abroad. He constantly protested against flogging in the army, the impressment of sailors, and imprisonment for debt. He took up the question of lighthouses and harbours; in the former he secured greater efficiency, in the latter he prevented useless expenditure. At first despised and ridiculed, afterwards dreaded for his tenacity of purpose, he ended by gaining the respect of friends and of foes, and the confidence of the whole nation. The breadth of his action, his singleness of aim, his perfect independence of all party or personal considerations, and an almost heroic earnestness and self-denial in carrying out his views, were the secrets of his influence. Himself as incorruptible as Aristides, he made it a special duty to hunt out and expose political corruption under whatever guise it lurked, and the whole army of place-hunters and jobbers found in him their most indefatigable and inexorable foe. There were many abler, but there was no more useful member in the House during the greater portion of his parliamentary career. He died February 20, 1855.
