HOLY WEEK (eβ8oμa<s μeγaλη, άγια or των άγιων, ξηροφαγίας, άπρακτος, also ημepaι παθημάτων, ημcρaι στavp-ωσιμaι; hebdomas [or septimana) major, sancta, authentica ∖ i.e., canoηizata, Du Cange], ultima, poenosa, luctuosa, nigra, inofficiosa, muta, crucis, lamentationum, indulgentioe), in the ecclesiastical year the week immediately preceding that of Easter. The earliest allusion to the custom of marking this week as a whole with special observances is to be found in the Apostolical Constitutions (v. 18, 19), dating from the latter half of the 3d century a.d. Abstinence from wine and flesh is there commanded for all the days, while for the Friday and Saturday an absolute fast is enjoined. Dionysius Alexandrinus also, in his canonical epistle (260 A.D.), refers to the six fasting days (jξ τωv vηστeιωv ημίραι) in a manner which implies that the observance of them had already become an established usage in his time. There is some doubt about the genuineness of an ordinance attributed to Constantine, in which abstinence from public business was enforced for the seven days immediately preceding Easter Sunday, and also for the seven which followed it; the Codex Theodosianus, however, is explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those fifteen days (1. ii. tit. viii.). Of the particular days of the “great week” the earliest to emerge into special prominence was naturally that which commemorated the supreme crisis of the passion; next came the Sabbatum Magnum (Holy Saturday or Easter Eve) with its vigil, which in the early church was associated with an expectation that the second advent would occur on an Easter Sunday. The Dominica Palmarum or in Palmis (fοpτη των ∕3αιωv) was, as we learn from Chrysostom, known and observed under that name in his day; for the fact of its observance in the Western Church, however, probably our earliest authority is the Venerable Bede. Maundy Thursday (ή μeyαλη πέμπτη, feria quinta paschae) is referred to both by Chrysostom and by Augustine as having been in their time marked by a general and solemn celebration of the sacrament of the supper; the latter writer also (Dp. 118, Ad Januarium) alludes to a partial observance of the pedilavium or footwashing which in later centuries became the most conspicuous feature in the church services of the day. For details of the elaborate ceremonial observed in the Roman Catholic Church during this week, reference must be made to the Missal and Breviary. In the Eastern Church the week is marked by similar practices, but with less elaboration and differentiation of rite. See also Easter and Good Friday.
