HYDE, a township of England in the parish of Stockport, Cheshire, is situated near the river Tame and the Peak Forest canal, and on the Midland, and the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railways, 7∣ miles east from Manchester and 6 north-east from Stqckport. It is under the government of a local board, and a county court is held there every Wednesday. St George’s church, in the Perpendicular style, was erected in 1832, and St Thomas, in the Early English, was erected in 1868. The principal other public buildings are the mechanics’ institute, the temperance hall, and the court-house. The town owes its importance to the cotton manufacture, and possesses weaving factories, spinning-mills, print-works, iron-foundries, and machineworks. There are extensive coal-mines in the vicinity. The old family of Hyde, to which the line of earls of Clarendon belonged, held possession of the township as early as the reign of John, but it was a mere village until the establishment of the cotton manufacture at the beginning of the present century. The population of the township in 1861 was 13,722, and in 1871 it was 14,223.
