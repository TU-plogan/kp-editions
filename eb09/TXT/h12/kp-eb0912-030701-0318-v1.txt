HOSPITIUM. The power the Greeks possessed of travelling safely among other Greek states depended on the feeling which made hospitality a matter of religion, and looked on strangers as under the protection of Zeus Xenios. A stranger was received and protected during his stay. Violation of the duties of hospitality was likely to provoke the wrath of the gods; but it does not appear that anything beyond this religious sanction existed to guard the rights of a traveller. There is, however, no ground for the common statement that a stranger was ipso facto considered as an enemy. In truth he was a guest. The roads were all sacred; he who passed over them was the guest of the land; he found along their courses statues of the tutelary deity of the road, generally Hermes; and the offerings of food, <kc., in front of these he was at liberty to appropriate. Hence the word tpμaιov was used in the sense of a lucky find. (See Curtius, “Griech. Wegebau,” Berlin Λbhandl., 1854.) When the guest parted from his host he was [9:12:308] often presented with gifts (£«αα), and sometimes a die (αστράγαλος) was broken between them. Each then took a part, a family connexion was established, and the broken die served as a symbol of recognition; thus the members of each family found in the other hosts and protectors in case of need. As the foreigner was not recognized by the law of the state in which he travelled, he could appear in a court of justice only through his host. Similar customs seem to have existed among the Italian races. In Rome there was a tie recognized by the law between host and guest, almost as strong as that which connected patron and client. Jupiter Hospitalis watched over the jus hospitii. As in Greece the connexion often became hereditary; and a tessera hospitalis was broken between the parties.

Besides this private connexion there was a custom according to which a state appointed among the citizens of another state one man called πρόξενος to protect any of their citizens travelling in his country. Sometimes an individual came forward voluntarily to perform these duties on behalf of another state (εθελοπρόξενος). Many cases occur where such an office was hereditary; thus the family of Callias at Athens were proxenoi of the Spartans. We find the office mentioned in a Corcyraean inscription dating probably from the 7th century b.c., and it continued to grow more important and frequent throughout Greek history. There is no proof that any direct emolument was ever attached to the office, while the expense and trouble entailed by it must often have been very great. Probably the honours which it brought with it were sufficient recompense. These consisted partly in the general respect and esteem paid to a proxenos, and partly in many more substantial honours conferred by special decree of the state whose representative he was, such as ∈7Γιγα∕Λtα, γης εγκτησι<s, aτελεLa, άσνλ,ία, προεδρία, and sometimes full citizenship. Public hospitium seems also to have existed among the Italian races; but the circumstances of their history prevented it from becoming so important as in Greece.
