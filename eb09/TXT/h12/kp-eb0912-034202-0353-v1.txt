HULSE, John (1708-1789), founder of the Hulsean lectureship at the university of Cambridge, was born at Middlewich, in Cheshire, in 1708. Entering St John’s College, Cambridge, he graduated in 1728, and on taking holy orders was presented to a small country curacy. His father having died in 1753, Hulse succeeded to his estates in Cheshire, where, owing to feeble health, he lived in retirement till his death in 1789. He bequeathed his estates to Cambridge University for the purpose of maintaining two scholars at St John’s College, of founding a prize for a dissertation, and of instituting the offices of Christian advocate and of Christian preacher or Hulsean lecturer. By a statute in 1860 the Hulsean professorship of divinity was substituted for the office of Christian advocate, and the lectureship was considerably modified. The first course of lectures under the benefaction was delivered in 1820. In 1830 the number of annual lectures or sermons was reduced from twenty to eight; subsequently they -were restricted to four. The annual value of the Hulse endowment is between £800 and £900, of which eight-tenths go to the professor of divinity and one-tenth to the prize and lectureship respectively.
