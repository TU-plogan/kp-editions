HOOGHLY, or Hùgli. The Hooghly river is the most westerly and commercially the most important channel by which the Ganges enters the Bay of Bengal. It takes its distinctive name near the town of Sântipur, about 120 miles from the sea. The stream now known as the Hooghly represents three western deltaic distributaries of the Ganges —viz., (1) the Bhagirathi, (2) the Jalangi, and (3) part of the Mâtâbhângâ. The Bhâgirathi and Jalangi unite at Nadiyâ, above the point of their junction with the lower waters of the Mâtâbhângâ, which has taken the name of the Churni before the point of junction and thrown out new distributaries of its own. These three western distributaries are known as “The Nadiyâ Rivers,” and are important, not only as great highways for internal traffic, but also as the headwaters of the Hooghly. Like other deltaic distributaries, they are subject to sudden changes in their channels, and to constant silting up. The supervising and keeping open of the Nadiyâ rivers has, therefore, formed one of the great tasks of fluvial engineering in Bengal. Proceeding south from Sântipur, with a twist to the east, the Hooghly river divides Murshidâbâd from Hooghly district, until it touches the district of the Twenty-Four Parganâs in 22° 57 ’ 30" N. lat. and 88° 27' 15" E. long. It then proceeds almost due south to Calcutta, next twists to the south-west, and finally turns south, entering the Bay of Bengal in 21° 41' N. lat. and 88° E. long.

In the 40 miles of its course that are above Calcutta, the channels of the Hooghly are under no supervision, and the result is that they have silted up and shifted to such an extent as to be no longer navigable for sea-going ships. Yet it was upon this upper section that all the famous ports of Bengal lay in olden times. From Calcutta to the sea (about 80 miles) the river is a record of engineering improvement and success. A minute supervision, with steady dredging and constant readjustment of buoys, now renders it a safe waterway to Calcutta for ships of the largest tonnage. Much attention has also been paid to the port of Calcutta. For its trade, shipping, and administration, see Calcutta.

Tl∣e tide runs rapidly on the Hooghly, and produces a remarkable example of the fluvial phenomenon known as a “bore.” This consists of the headwave of the advancing tide, hemmed in where the estuary narrows suddenly into the river, and often exceeds 7 feet in height. It is felt as high up as Calcutta, and frequently sinks small boats or dashes them to pieces on the bank. The difference from the lowest point of low-water in the dry season to the highest point of high-water in the rains is reported at 20 feet 10 inches. The greatest mean rise of tide, about 16 feet, takes place in March, April, or May,—with a declining range during the rainy season to a mean of 10 feet, and a minimum during freshets of 3 feet 6 inches. The scenery on the banks of the Hooghly varies greatly. The sea approach presents nothing to view but sandbanks, succeeded by mean-looking mud formations covered with coarse grass. As the river narrows, however, the country improves. Trees and rice fields and villages are common, and at length a section is reached where the banks are high, and lined with hamlets buried under evergreen groves. Then come long tiers of shipping, with the stately painted mansions of Garden Reach on the margin in the foreground, the fort rising from the great plain on the bank higher up, and the domes, steeples, and noble public buildings of Calcutta beyond,— all gradually unfolding their beauties in a long panorama.
