HOLIBUT, oiâˆ™ Halibut (Hippoglossus vulgaris), is the largest of all Flat-fishes, specimens of 5 feet in length and of 100 K> in weight being frequently exposed for sale in the markets. Indeed, specimens under 2 feet in length are very rarely caught, and singularly enough, no instance is known of a very young specimen having been obtained. The holibut is much more frequent in the higher latitudes of the temperate zone than in its southern portion; it is a circumpolar species, being found on the northern coasts of America, Europe, and Asia, extending in the Pacific southwards to California. On the British coasts it keeps at some distance from the shore, and is generally caught in from 50 to 150 fathoms. Its flesh is considered coarse, though white and firm.
