HÖLDERLIN, Johann Christian Friedrich (1770- 1843), German poet, was born March 29, 1770, at Lauffen on the Neckar. His mother removing, after a second marriage, to Nürtingen, he began his education at the classical school there, where Schelling was his schoolfellow and playmate. He was destined by his relations for the church, and with this view was later admitted to the free schools of Denkendorf and Maulbronn. At the age of eighteen, already an excellent classical scholar, he was sent to the university of Tübingen, where, however, he showed no inclination to the study of theology. He was already the writer of occasional verses, and had begun to sketch his first version of Hyperion, when he was introduced in 1793 to Schiller, and obtained through him the post of tutor to the young son of Frau von Kalb. A year later he left this situation to attend Fichte’s lectures, and to become a disciple of Schiller in Jena. Schiller recognized in the young poet something of his own style of genius, and encouraged his early literary attempts by sending some of them to Goethe, and by superintending the publication of others in the Thalia and Horen. In 1796 Hölderlin obtained the post of tutor to the three young children of a banker named Gontard in Frankfort. Gontard’s beautiful and gifted wife is the Diotima of Hölderlin’s Hyperion. For this lady he conceived a foolish and hopeless passion; and she became at once his inspiration and his ruin. At the end of two years, during which time the first volume of Hyperion was published (1797), some kind of crisis appears to have occurred in their friendship, for the unhappy young poet suddenly left Frankfort and the Gontard family; but whether he was dismissed by the indignant husband of Diotima, or was impelled by his own better resolutions, has not been explained. In spite of ill health, he now completed Hyperion, the second volume of which appeared in 1799, and he began a tragedy, Der Tod des Empedokles, which is published in an unfinished condition among his works. Some of his verses appeared in the Taschenbuch für Frauenzimmer va 1799 and 1800; and he contemplated starting a new literary journal, of which he was to be the editor, but the scheme was a failure. His friends now became alarmed at the alternate depression and nervous irritability from which he suffered, and he was induced to go to Switzerland, as tutor in a family at Haupt will. There his health improved; and several of his poems, among which are “Der blinde Säuger,”“AnDie Hoffnung,” and “Dichter-muth,” were written at this time. In 1801 he returned home to arrange for the publication of a volume of his poems; but, on the failure of this enterprise, he was obliged to accept another tutorship in the family of the Hamburg consul in Bordeaux. Diotima died a year later, in June 1802, and the news is supposed to have reached Hölderlin shortly afterwards, for in the following month he suddenly left Bordeaux, and travelled homewards on foot through France, arriving at Nürtingen destitute and insane. Kind treatment gradually alleviated his condition, and in lucid intervals he occupied himself by writing verses and translating Greek plays. Two of these translations—the Antigone and Oedipus Rex of Sophocles—appeared in 1804, and several of his short poems were published by Seckendorf in his Musenalmanach, 1807 and 1808. In 1804 Hölderlin obtained the post of librarian to the landgrave of Homburg, and went to live in Homburg under the supervision of friends; but the post was abandoned two years later, and he was taken to Tübingen, where he remained, irremediably but harmlessly insane, till his death, June 7, 1843.

Hölderlin’s writings are the production of a beautiful and sensitive mind, a mind of high ideals and noble impulses; but they are intensely, almost morbidly, subjective, and they lack real human strength. Perhaps his strongest characteristic was his passion for Greek subjects, and the natural result of this was that he almost entirely discarded rhyme in favour of the ancient verse measures. His poems are all short pieces; of his tragedy only a fragment was written. Hyperion, oder der Eremit in Griechenland, is thus his one important work; and even to this a sequel is wanting. It may be called a prose poem, and is written in the form of letters. Its exquisite language, the purity of its tone, the sad philosophical vein which permeates it, together with its autobiographic character, claim for it a unique position among German classics.

An edition of Hölderlin’s complete works, with his letters and biography, appeared in 1846; and there is a cheap edition of his selected works, with a biography by Christoph Theodor Schwab, published in 1874.
