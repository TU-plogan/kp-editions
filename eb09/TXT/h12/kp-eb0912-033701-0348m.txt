HUGH of St Cher, Hugo (Ugo) de S. Caro or Carensis (c. 1200-1263), a learned compiler of the 13th century, was born at St Cher, a suburb of Vienne, Dauphiné, about the year 1200, became a student of theology and canon law in Paris, and in 1224 entered the Dominican cloister of St Jacob there (whence hé is sometimes designated as Hugo de S. Jacobo). After having taught theology for upwards of twenty years, in the course of which his learning was frequently appealed to by those in authority for the solution of difficult questions, he was in 1245 created cardinal of St Sabina by Pope Innocent IV He died at Orvieto in 1263.

His principal works are Correctorium Biblice, a revised text of the Vulgate, prepared about 1236, hitherto unprinted, but forming the basis of the Correctorium Biblice Sorbonicum; Postilla in universa Biblia juxta quadruplicem sensum, first printed in 1487 (Basel) and often since, as for example at Cologne in 1621 (8 vols, fol.); Specillum Ecclesiae, a manual for the priesthood (ed. prin., Lyons, 1554); and Sacrorum Bibliorum Concordantice, in the preparation of which he was assisted by the members of the community to which he belonged, hence it is sometimes known as Concordantioe S. Jacobi (Lyons, 1540; Basel, 1543). See Hist. Litt, de la France, vol. xix.
