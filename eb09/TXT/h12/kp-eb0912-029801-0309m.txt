HOSHANGÂBÂD, a British district in the chief commissionership of the Central Provinces of India, lying between 21° 40' and 22° 59' N. lat. and between 76° 38' 30" and 78° 45' 30" E. long. It is bounded N. by the Narbadâ (Nerbudda), which separates it from the territories of Bhopâl, Sindhia, and Holkar; E. by the Dudhi river, dividing it from Narsinghpur district; S. by the districts of Western Berar, Betιil, and Chhindwâra; and W. by Nimâr. Hoshangâbâd may be described as a valley of varying breadth, extending for 150 miles between the Nerbudda and the Sâtpura mountains. The soil consists chiefly of black basaltic alluvium, often more than 20 feet deep; but along the banks of the Nerbudda the fertility of the land compensates for the tameness of the scenery. Towards the west, low stony hills and broken ridges cut up the level ground, while the Vindhyâs and the Sâtpuras throw out jutting spurs and ranges. In this wilder country considerable regions are covered with jungle. On the south the lofty range which shuts in the valley is remarkable in mountain scenery, surpassing in its picturesque irregularity the Vindhyân chain in the north. Many streams take their rise amid its precipices, then, winding through deep glens, flow across the plain between sandy banks covered with low jungle, till they swell the waters of the mighty Nerbudda. None of the streams are of any importance except the Tawâ, which is interesting to the geologist on account of the many minerals to be found along its course. The boundary rivers, the Nerbudda and Tapti, are the only considerable waters in Hoshangâbâd. At Chârwâ a dense low jungle extends over a large region, but by far the finest timber is found at Bori and Denwa.

The census of 1877 showed a population of 463,625 (Europeans, 86; Eurasians, 10; aboriginal tribes, 89,029; Hindus, 364,679; Mahometans, 21,765; Buddhists and Jains, 1132). There are only four towns with a population exceeding 5000, viz., Hoshangâbâd, 11,613; Harda, 9170; Seoni, 7579; and Sohâgpur, 7552. The total revenue in 1876—77 was £69,842; the total cost of officials and police, £14,733. There were 11 civil and revenue judges, and 22 magistrates. The number of police was '582. There were 94 Government schools, attended by 4024 pupils.

Of the total area of 4376 square miles only 1442 are cultivated, and of the portion lying waste 825 are returned as cultivable; 2455 acres are irrigated entirely by private enterprise. Wheat forms the staple crop of the district; the other products are inferior grains, cotton, and sugar-cane. Hoshangâbâd does a considerable export trade in agricultural produce, receiving in return English piece-goods, spices, cocoa-nuts, salt, and sugar. The extent of made roads in Hoshangâbâd is returned at 498 miles. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway intersects the whole district from east to west, with stations at the principal towns. Besides roads and railway, the Nerbudda, with its tributaries, supplies means of communication by water for 150 miles during part of the year. The district is generally free from violent alternations of temperature, hot winds are rare, and the nights during the sultry weather and rains are always cool. The rainfall is exceedingly variable, ranging between the limits of 40 and 60 inches for the year. The prevailing diseases are fevers and bowel complaints. In 1876 five charitable dispensaries afforded medical relief to 18,206 in-door and out-door patients.

History.— Little is known of the history of Hoshangâbâd prior to the Marhattâ invasion. When the Mughal troops occupied Handiâ, the eastern part of the district inhabited by Gonds, who still retain their possession, maintained a rude independence. About 1720 Dost Muhammad, the founder of the Bhopal family, captured the town of Hoshangâbâd, and annexed a considerable territory with it. In 1750 Râja Raghuji Bhonslâ of Nâgpur reduced the country east of Handiâ and south of the Nerbudda, except the portion held by Bhopâl. In 1795 the rival dynasties of Bhopâl and Nâgpur came into conflict, and the town and fort of Hoshangâbâd were captured by the Nâgpur forces. In 1802 the Bhopâls retrieved their loss. The Nâgpur army again besieged the fort, but failed in their attack, and contented themselves with burning the town. In 1809 Hoshangâbâd was again assailed by a Nâgpur force, and the Bhopâls, finding their communications with Bhopâl cut off, surrendered. Overcome by these disasters, the Bhopâls called in the Pindhâris to their help, and till they were finally extirpated in

1817 the whole of this fertile region became a prey to ravage and massacre. Under the order which the British Government has restored, the prosperity of the country is gradually returning. In

1818 that part of the district held by Nâgpur was ceded under an agreement. In 1844 the region of Harda Handiâ was made over by Smdhiâ in part payment of the Gwalior contingent, and by the treaty of 1860 became British territory.

Hoshangâbâd, the headquarters town of the above district, 22° 45' 30" N. lat., 77° 46' E. long., is situated on the south side of the Nerbudda. Population (1877) 11,613. It is supposed to have been founded by Hoshang Shâh, the second of the Ghori kings of Mâlwâ; but it remained an insignificant place till the Bhopâl conquest about 1720, when a massive stone fort was constructed, with its base on the river, commanding the Bhopâl road. It sustained several sieges, and passed alternately into the hands of the Bhopâl and Nâgpur troops. From 1818 it [9:12:299] has been the residence of the chief British officials in charge of the district. A church has been built, and a first-class jail constructed. The town has a dispensary and schoolhouses. It is the chief seat of the English piece-goods trade of the district, and has a brisk trade in cotton, grain, and bills of exchange.
