HOPKINS, Samuel (1721-1803), the theologian from whom the Hopkinsians or Hopkinsian Calvinists take their name, was born at Waterbury, Connecticut, on September 17, 1721. About his fifteenth year he entered Yale College, where he graduated in 1741; he afterwards studied divinity at Northampton with Jonathan Edwards; and in 1743 he was ordained pastor of the church at Housatonnuc (now Great Barrington), Massachusetts. There in the midst of a small settlement of only thirty families he laboured for six and twenty years, preaching, studying, and writing, until in 1769 he was dismissed from his office on the alleged ground of want of funds for his support. He next began to preach in Newport, Rhode Island, where, in 1770, he was settled as pastor of a small congregation, and where, with an interval from 1776 to 1780, caused by the occupation of the British, he continued to labour until about the close of the century. In 1799 he had an attack of paralysis, from which he never wholly recovered; but he continued to preach occasionally, and with unimpaired mental vigour, almost until his death, which occurred on December 20,1803.

While in vigour of intellect and in strength and purity of moral tone hardly inferior to Jonathan Edwards, Hopkins considerably excelled his master in force and energy of character. To him belongs the honour of having been one of the first to stir up and organize political action against slavery; and to his persistent though bitterly opposed efforts are chiefly to be attributed the law of 1774, which forbade the importation of negroes into New England, as also that of 1784, which declared that all children of slaves born after the following March should be free. He was the author of numerous pamphlets, addresses, and sermons; and he also published lives of Jonathan Edwards, Susannah Anthony, and Mrs Osborn. But his distinctive theological tenets are chiefly to be sought in his important work, the System of Theology, which, published in 1791, has had an influence hardly inferior to that exercised by the writings[9:12:159] of Edwards himself. They may be summed up as follows :— (1) God is the efficient cause of all the volitions of the human heart, whether these be good or evil; (2) the guilt of Adam’s first sin lies upon Adam alone; moral corruption consists exclusively in the opposition offered by the human heart to the doing of that which it is really and fully capable of doing; (3) all virtue or true holiness consists in disinterested benevolence; (4) all sin consists in selfishness; (5) reconciliation and redemption are fundamentally distinct; the former opens the gate of mercy, the latter applies to individuals Christ’s saving benefits; (6) effectual calling consists in a willingness to allow himself to be saved, produced in the heart of the sinner by God; (7) although the righteousness of Christ is the sole ground of the sinner’s justification, yet is that righteousness not imputed; (8) repentance is prior in point of time to the exercise of faith in Christ.

. The works of Hopkins, first published in two volumes at Boston in 1791, appeared in a 2d edition in 1811. The latest and best edition is that of 1852, in three volumes, also publi-hed at Boston; to it there is prefixed a biographical sketch by Professor Park of Andover.
