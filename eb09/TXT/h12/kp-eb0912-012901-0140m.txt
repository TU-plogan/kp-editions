HOND iY, or San Bartolommeo de Honda, a town of the republic of Colombia, in the state of Cundinamarca, on the left bank of the river Magdalena, about 575 miles from the sea, in 5° 1Γ 42" N. lat. and 74° 4Γ 6" W. long. It is regular and well-built, but none of its public edifices— churches, convents, or hospitals—call for special remark. Situated at the spot where the upward navigation of the Magdalena is stopped by a series of rapids, Honda was formerly the seat of a very considerable trade, and it still retains a certain amount of commercial importance. Goods and passengers for Bogotâ, the capital of Colombia, are now disembarked at Caracoli about 2 miles further down. The population of Honda is stated at 4000 or 5000. See Colombia, vol. vi. p. 153.
