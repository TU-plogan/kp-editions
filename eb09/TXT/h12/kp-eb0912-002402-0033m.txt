HITCHCOCK, Edward (1793-1864), an American geologist, was born of poor parents at Deerfield, Massachusetts, May 24, 1793. He owed his education chiefly to his own exertions, and was preparing himself to enter Harvard College when he was compelled to interrupt his studies from a weakness in his eyesight. In 1815 he became principal of the academy of his native town; but he resigned this office in 1818 in order to study for the ministry. Having been ordained in 1821 pastor of the Congregational church of Conway, Massachusetts, he employed his hours of leisure in making a scientific survey of the western counties of the State. In 1825 he resigned his charge in order to become professor of chemistry and natural history in the newly-founded Amherst College, an institution which owed its early success, if not its continued existence, to his energetic efforts, both in rescuing it from [9:12:25] financial difficulties, and in increasing its literary and scientific efficiency. More especially did he render to it invaluable service during the period when he was president, from 1845 to 1854. In 1830 he was appointed State geologist of Massachusetts, and in 1836 to the same office in connexion with the first district of the State of New York. On resigning the presidentship of Amherst College, he was induced to retain his professorship. In 1836 he received the degree of LL.D, from Harvard, and in 1846 that of D.D. from Middlebury College. Besides his constant labours in geology, zoology, and botany, Hitchcock took an active interest in agriculture, and in 1850 he was sent by the Massachusetts legislature to examine into the methods of the agricultural schools of Europe. In geology his most important achievement was the examination and exposition of the fossil footprints of the Connecticut valley. The collection which he accumulated in connexion with his investigations is contained in the Hitchcock Ichnological Museum of Amherst College, and a description of it was published in 1858 in his report to the Massachusetts legislature on the ichnology of New England. As a writer on geological science, Hitchcock was mainly concerned in determining the connexion between it and religion, and employing its results to explain and support what he regarded as the truths of revelation. He died at Amherst, February 27, 1864.

The following are his principal works :— Geology of the Connecticut Valley, 1823; Catalogue of Plants within twenty miles of Amherst, 1829; Dyspepsia Forestalled and Resisted, 1830; Reports on the Geology of Massachusetts, 1832, 1835,1838, and 1841; A Wreath for the Tomb, 1839; Fossil Footsteps in the United States, 1848; Outlines of Geology, 1855; Illustrations of Surface Geology, 1856; Ichnology of New England, 1858; Religious Lectures on the Peculiar Phenomena of the Four Seasons, 1850; History of a Zoological Temperance Convention in Central Africa, 1850; The Religion of Geology ψnd its Connected Sciences, 1851; Religious Truths illustrated from Science, 1857; Reminiscences of Amherst College, 1863; and various papers in the Biblical Repository, the Bibliotheca Sacra, the American Journal of Science, and other periodicals.
