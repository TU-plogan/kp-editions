HOPE, Thomas (c. 1770-1831), the author of Anastasüis, born at London about 1770, was descended from a branch of an old Scotch family who for several generations were extensive merchants iu London and Amsterdam. About the age of eighteen he started on a tour through various parts of Europe, Asia, aud Africa, where he interested himself especially in architecture and sculpture, making a large collection of the principal objects which attracted his attention. On his return to London he purchased a house in Duchess Street, which he fitted up in a very ornamental and elaborate style, from drawings made by himself. In 1805 he published sketches of his furniture, accompanied by letterpress, in a folio volume, entitled Household Furniture and Decoration, which had considerable influence in effecting a change in the upholstery and interior decoration of houses. In 1809 he published the Costumes of the Ancients, and in 1812 Designs of Modern Costumes, works which display a large amount of special antiquarian research. He was also a munificent patron of the highest forms of art, and both at his London house and his country seat at Deepdene near Dorking he formed large collections of paintings, sculpture, and antiques. Thorwaldsen, the Danish sculptor, was indebted to him for the early recognition of his talents, and he also gave frequent employment to Chantrey and Flaxman. In 1819 he published anonymously his novel Anastasius, or Memoirs of a Modern Greek, written at the close of the 18i7t century, a work which, chiefly on account of the novel character of its subject, caused a great sensation. It was generally attributed to Lord Byron, but, though remarkable for the acquaintance it displays with Eastern life, and distinguished by considerable imaginative vigour and much graphic and picturesque description, its paradoxes are not so striking as those in which Lord Byron indulged; and, notwithstanding some eloquent and forcible passages, the only reason which warranted its ascription to him was the general type of character to which its hero belonged. Hope died February 3, 1831. He was the author of two works published posthumously,—the Origin and Prospects of Man, 1831, in which he indulged in speculations diverging widely from the usual orthodox opiuions, and an Historical Essay on Architecture, 1835, an elaborate description of the architecture of the Middle Ages, illustrated by drawings made by himself in Italy and Germany.
