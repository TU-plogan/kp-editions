HOMEL, or Gomel, a town of Russia in Europe, in the government of Mohileff, 132 miles S. of Mohileff, on the highway to Tchernigoff, and on the right bank of the Sosh, which joins the Dnieper about 45 miles further down. It is a place of considerable importance, possessing (according to the St Petersburg Calendar for 1878) a population of 13,030, the suburb of Bielitsa being included. Most of the houses are of wood, but there are a good number of churches, several hospitals, and public schools. Three of the Orthodox churches were built by Rumantzeff, who lies buried in St Peter’s. The sugar-refineries are the most important of the industrial establishments. A good trade is carried on in the agricultural produce of the surrounding dist rict, partly with Warsaw and partly with Riga. In 1860, when the population amounted to 13,659, there were 3637 Raskolniks (separatists) and 6518 Jews.

Homel, which appears in the older documents as Gomie or Gomi and Gom, is mentioned for the first time in 1142, when it belonged to the Tchernigoff principality. The first inhabitants were Rodi-mitchians. In the 12th century we find Izyaslaff Daviditch taking refuge at Homel on his expulsion from Kieff. Along with Tchernigoff the town passed under the power of Lithuania; but in the 15th century Simeon, son of John of Mozhaisk, to whom it had been entrusted by King Alexander, entered the service of John III. of Moscow, and it was not till 1537 that it was recovered for Sigismund Augustus by Prince Radzivill and a body of Crim Tatars. The bailiwick was granted to the Polish grandees; and by the last of these—Prince Tcharovizhski—a strong oaken castle was erected. In 1648 the town suffered from the invasion of Bogudan Khmel-nitzki, who put to death 1500 Roman Catholics and Jewβ. In 1655 it passed voluntarily to the side of the insurgent Cossacks, but at the peace of Andιmsoff it remained with Poland. It was not incorporated with White Russia till the reign of Catherine II., who assigned it to Field-Marshal Rumantzeff Zadunaiski. In 1834 it was purchased by Prince Paskevitch, and in 1852 it was made the chief town of a district.
