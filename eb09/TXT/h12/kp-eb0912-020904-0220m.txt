HORTENSE (1783-1837), queen of Holland, is familiarly known as La Reine Hortense. Her proper name was Eugénie Hortense de Beauharnais, and she was the only daughter of Alexandre de Beauharnais and Josephine Tascher de la Pagerie. She was born on the 10th of April 1783. When four years old she accompanied her mother to Martinique, and returned with her three years later to be subjected to all the dangers of the Revolution. For a time she was sent with her brother to England, but soon returned. The marriage of her mother to Napoleon. Bonaparte naturally altered her prospects altogether, and, as she grew to woman’s estate, several marriages of more or less importance were proposed for her. It suited the first consul, however, that she should marry his brother Louis, and despite her tears and entreaties the marriage was concluded. In one of his moments of brutal frankness Napoleon confessed that his brother as a husband was “insupportable,” though he characteristically proceeded to charge Hortense with having been the cause of his own misfortunes in no; agreeing with her husband. Louis it appears was sincerely anxious to please his young wife. But his health was bad and hrs temper gloomy, while Hortense was exceptionally lively and fond of gaiety. The natural consequence was an infinity of scandal, some of it of a very grave character. The recent publication of Madame de Rémusat’s memoirs has, however, gone far to exonerate Hortense. The writer, equally outspoken and well informed, gives instances of [9:12:210] the most fantastic and disgusting exercise of conjugal tyranny on Louis’s part, and denies that his wife in any way misconducted herself, the malignant jealousy of the Bonaparte sisters being credited with the accusation. Within seven years of her marriage Hortense had three children, whose nomenclature, unless carefully studied, is somewhat puzzling. The eldest, Napoleon-Louis-Charles, was born in 1802 and died in 1807. The next, Napoleon-Louis, was born in 1804 and died in 1831. The third, Charles-Louis-Napoleon, was born in 1807, and lived to be the late emperor Napoleon III. When Napoleon distributed crowns to his relations Hortense was very anxious that her husband should receive that of Italy. Holland, however, fell to his share, and the ill-matched pair retired thither. The death of her eldest son made Holland intolerable to Hortense, and before long she returned to Paris and established herself in the Rue Cerutti. Nor did she from that time forward ever live in any regular fashion with her husband, whose forced abdication of his crown soon followed. In Paris she was more popular than respected, and her leisure time was filled up with many quasi-literary and artistic employments. It was there that she signalized herself by composing among other airs the famous melody of Partant pour la Syrie. The ineffable silliness of the words of this song is not due to her, but to a certain Μ. de Laborde; and it is only fair to say that it took Frenchmen twenty years to find out that the air was ugly, and that it was possibly stolen. Hortense continued even after her mother’s divorce to exercise a certain influence over her stepfather. At the first Restoration she was confirmed in her title and possessions as Duchesse de Saint-Leu. But she ardently welcomed the returning emperor, and thenceforward France was hardly a residence for her, while her private life was disturbed by constant and indecent bickerings with her husband about the custody of her children. She bought a house at Arenenberg on the Lake of Constance and another at Augsburg, for the sake of educating her sons, and from time to time she undertook various journeys in the hope of furthering their interests. The Revolution of July gave her some chance of returning to France, but immediately afterwards grave misfortunes overtook her. Her sons took part in the Italian risings, and the elder died of measles. Scarcely had she recovered from this when the Strasburg attempt was made against her advice. She lived long enough to see the future emperor return from America, and died at Arenenberg on the 3d October 1837. Generally speaking, Hortense appears to have been an amiable woman, whose life was spoilt by the tyrannical egotism of her stepfather. She seems, however, to have been unduly given to intrigue; and she herself admitted that she might have lived on better terms with her husband, upon whom she was forced almost as much as he was forced, on her.
