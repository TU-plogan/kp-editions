HUNTINGDON, Selina, Countess of (1707-1791), leader of a sect of Calvinistic methodists, known as the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion, was the daughter of Washington Shirley, second Earl Ferrers. She was born at Stanton Harold, a mansion near Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, August 24, 1707, and in her twenty-first year was married to Theophilus, ninth earl of Huntingdon. The religious influence of her husband’s sisters, and a dangerous illness soon after her marriage, tended to deepen the serious impressions which the young countess had experienced from childhood; and on the death of her husband in 1746, coming under the influence of the religious revival in which Wesley and Whitfield were at that time conspicuous, she resolved to join these preachers in actively furthering their aims. In 1748 she gave Whitfield a scarf as her chaplain, and in that capacity he frequently preached in her town house to the most fashionable audiences, in which sometimes such men as Chesterfield, Walpole, and Bolingbroke were found. Reducing her personal expenditure, and disregarding the sneers of her aristocratic acquaintances, Lady Huntingdon spent her ample means in building chapels in different parts of England, and appointed ministers to officiate in them, under the impression that as a peeress she had a right to employ as many chaplains as she would. In 1768 she converted the old mansion of Trevecca, near Talgarth, in South Wales, into a theological seminary for training young ministers for the Connexion; and this, which she made her chief residence, she continued to support alone till her death. Up to 1779 Lady Huntingdon and her chaplains continued members of the Church of England, but in that year the prohibition of her chaplains by the consistorial court from preaching in the Pantheon, a large building in London rented for the purpose by the countess, compelled her in order to evade the injunction to take shelter under the Toleration Act. This reluctant step, which placed her legally among dissenters, had the effect of severing from the. Connexion several eminent and useful members. Till her death in London, June 17, 1791, Lady Huntingdon continued to exercise an active, and even autocratic, superintendence over her chapels and chaplains, and maintained her leading position as well by her genuine earnest piety and force of character as by her high social station and generous liberality. Her chapels and college were bequeathed to trustees; and in 1792 the latter was removed to Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire, where it has since flourished. Several congregations of the Connexion have become nominally as well as virtually Congregational chapels; while, even by those which retain the original name, the Congregational polity is practically adopted.

The Life of the Countess of Huntingdon was published at London, in 2 vols., in 1844; The Coronet and the Cross, or Memorials of Selina, Countess of Huntingdon, by A. H. New, appeared in 1857.
