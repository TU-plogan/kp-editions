HUBER, Johann (1830-1879), a philosophical and theological writer whose name is intimately connected in Germany, and indeed throughout Europe, with the Old Catholic and other recent movements towards freedom and enlightenment, was born in very humble circumstances, on August 18, 1830, at Munich, where, originally destined for the priesthood, he early began the study of theology. By the writings of Spinoza and Oken, however, he was strongly drawn to philosophical pursuits, and it was in philosophy that he “habilitated” (1854), and ultimately became professor (extraordinarius in 1859 and ordinarius in 1864). Along with Döllinger and others he attracted a large amount of public attention in 1869 by the challenge to the Ultramontane promoters of the Vatican council in the treatise Der Papst u. der Koncil, which appeared under the pseudonym of “Janus,” and also in 1870 by a series of letters (“Römische Briefe ”), which were published in the Allgemeine Zeitung. The nature of the numerous controversies in which he became involved both before and after this main episode of his life may be gathered from the subjoined list of his published writings. He died suddenly of heart disease at Munich on March 20, 1879.

His treatise Ueber dieWillensfreiheit (1858) was followed in 1859by Die Philosophie der Kirchenväter, which was promptly placed by the Roman authorities upon the Index, and which led to the prohibition of all Catholic students from attending his lectures; Johannes Scotus Erigena, 1861; Idee der Unsterblichkeit, 1864; Studien, 1865; Der Proletarier: zur Orientirung in der socialen Frage, 1865; Der Jesuitenorden nach Verfassung u. Doktrin, Wissenschaft u. Geschichte, 1873; Der Pessimismus, 1876; Die Forschung nach der Materie, 1877; Zur Philosophie der Astronomie, 1878; Das Gedächtniss, 1878. He also published adverse criticisms on Darwin, Strauss, Hartmann, and Haeckel; pamphlets on Das Papstthum u. der Staat, 1870, and on Die Freiheiten der französischen Kirche, 1871; and a volume of Kleine Schriften, 1871.
