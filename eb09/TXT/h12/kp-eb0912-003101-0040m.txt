+====================================================================+


HOBBES, Thomas (1588-1679), was born at Westport, adjoining (now forming part of) Malmesbury, in North Wilts, on Good Friday, the 5th of April 1588,—brought prematurely into the world through his mother’s fright at the rumours of the coming Spanish Armada. His father was vicar of Charlton and Westport, an illiterate and choleric man, who is said to have got into trouble later on by quarrelling with a rival at the church door, and been forced to decamp, leaving his three children (of whom Thomas was second) to the charitable care of an elder brother, a flourishing glover in Malmesbury. Hobbes was put to school at Westport church at the age of four, passed to the Malmesbury school at eight, and was taught again in Westport later, at a private school kept by a young man named Robert Latimer, fresh from Oxford and “a good Grecian.” He had begun Latin and Greek early, and under Latimer made such progress as to be able to translate the Medea of Euripides into Latin iambic verse before he was fourteen. About the age of fifteen he was sent to Oxford by his uncle and entered at Magdalen Hall, which had just been put on an independent footing, after being first a grammar school in connexion with the great foundation of Magdalen College and then governed as a hall by one of the college fellows. While Hobbes was there as a student the first principal of Magdalen Hall, Dr John Hussee, gave way to a second, Dr John Wilkinson, who is noted as having ruled strongly in the interest of the Calvinistic party in the university; and this fact, with other circumstances in the Oxford life of the time, makes it not improbable that the destined foe of the Puritan Revolution was thus early led to mark the aggressive Puritan spirit. For the rest, Oxford did no more to train Hobbes’s mind for his future philosophical work than the decayed scholastic regimen of the universities in that age was able to do for any other of the active spirits that then began in different countries to open the modern era of thought and inquiry. We have from himself a lively record of his experience and pursuits as a student (Vit. carm. exp., p. lxxxv.),^[1. There are three accounts of Hobbes’s life, first published together in 1681, two years after his death, by R. B. (Richard Blackburne, a friend of Hobbes’s admirer, John Aubrey), and reprinted, with complimentary verses by Cowley and others, at the beginning of Sir W. Molesworth’s collection of the Latin Works: —(1) T. II. Malrnesb. Vita (pp. xiii.-xxi.), written by Hobbes himself, or (as also reported) by T. Rymer, at his dictation; (2) Vitae Hobbianoe Auctarium (pp. xxii.-lxxx.), turned into Latin from Aubrey’s English; (3) T. H. Malrnesb. Vita carmine expressa (pp. lxxxi.-xcix.), written by Hobbes at the age of eighty-four (first published by itself in 1680). The Life of Mr T. II. of Malmesburie, printed among the Lives of Eminent Men, in 1813, from Aubrey’s papers in the Bodleian, &c. (vol. ii. pt. ii. pp. 593-637), contains some interesting particulars not found in the Auctarium. ] which, though penned in extreme old age, may be taken as sufficiently trustworthy. In this he tells how he was set to learn “Barbara, Celarent,” but, when he had slowly taken in the doctrine of figures and moods, he put it aside and would prove things only in his own way; how he then heard about bodies as consisting of matter and form, as throwing off species of themselves for perception, and as moved by sympathies and antipathies, with much else of a like sort,all beyond his comprehension; and how he therefore turned to things more congenial, took up his old books again, fed his mind on maps and charts of earth and sky, traced the sun in his path, followed Drake and Cavendish girdling the main, and gazed with delight upon pictured haunts of men and wonders of unknown lands. Very characteristic in this account is the interest in men and things, and the disposition to cut through questions in the schools after a trenchant fashion of his own. We may also believe that he was little attracted by the scholastic learning, and only should err if we took his words as evidence of a precocious insight into its weakness. The truth probably is that, finding himself left at Oxford very much to his own devices, he took no particular interest in studies which there was no risk in neglecting, and thought as little of rejecting as of accepting the traditional doctrines. He adds that he took his degree at the proper time; but in fact, upon any computation and from whatever cause, he remained at Magdalen Hall five, instead of the required four, years, not being admitted as bachelor till February 5, 1608.

In the same year, shortly after leaving the university, Hobbes was recommended by Wilkinson as tutor to the son of William Cavendish, baron of Hardwick, and thus began a connexion with a great and powerful family that ended only with his life. Twice it was loosened— once, for a short time, after twenty years, and again, for a longer period, during the Civil War—but it never was broken, and during more than fifty years, to the credit alike of him and his patrons, it was of the closest character. William Cavendish, second son of the famous “Bess of Hardwick” by the second of her four marriages, had just by the favour of King James obtained his barony, before being advanced, a few years later, to the earldom of Devonshire. His son, the heir to a name thus rising as well as to a great fortune, was hardly younger than Hobbes, and was indeed already married, a f e w m onths before, at the instance of the king, who made up the match, to the only daughter of the Scottish Lord Bruce of Kinloss, though by reason of the bride’s age, which was only twelve years, the pair had no establishment for some time to come. In the circumstances Hobbes was companion rather than tutor (before becoming secretary) to young Cavendish; and, growing soon greatly attached to each other, they were sent abroad together on the grand tour in 1610. How long they were gone upon this journey, which lay through France, Germany, and Italy, is not known: but it was long enough to give [9:12:32] Hobbes the opportunity of acquiring a moderate knowledge of French and Italian; and he did not return without having received a distinct mental impulse that had a lasting effect on his life. The real intellectual activity of that time (still more than five and twenty years before the definite inauguration of modern philosophy by Descartes’s Discourse on Method in 1637) was in the newly enlarged if not newly opened domain of physical science; and Hobbes was little prepared by his juvenile training to understand the achievements of Galileo and Kepler, if he heard anything of them. But he had had a little modicum of scholastic philosophy retailed to him at Oxford; and now, wherever he went, he could hear nothing but words of scorn poured upon all such learning. How it had come to pass that the scholastic way of thinking, once so dominant, was thus discredited at the hands alike of revolutionary thinkers such as Bruno, of scientific workers like Galileo, and of men of the world like Montaigne, he could not know. Accordingly, it seems that at first he was more dismayed to find that the only knowledge to which he could pretend was laughed at by people whom he did not understand, than pleased to be furnished with such an excuse for his own youthful indifference to its value. It was not long, however, before he yielded to the stream. He was not yet able to strike out a new line of thought, and so (like Descartes) rise above the misconceptions mingled with the general aversion from scholasticism, amounting to a neglect of all philosophy. He had but sufficient force of mind to wish to· be seen, like others, at work upon something else. The line he should take could hardly be doubtful; he had nothing to fall back upon except his Latin and Greek. He was no longer so familiar with them, but it was still open to him to become a scholar; nor in the age of Scaliger and Casaubon was there any lack of ambition in making classical study the occupation of a life. The resolution was made when he returned home, if not earlier, and made in a determined spirit; but when after many years’ labour he had made himself a scholar, his true work was still to lie all before him.

Hobbes’s period of scholarly acquirement lasted till 1628, and had as its immediate outcome a translation of Thucydides. In Derbyshire or in London, with his young master, he had abundant leisure and easy access to books, and he went carefully through the classical poets and historians, reading critically with the help of commentators, and at the same time bent on acquiring (as if for future use) a good Latin style, clear and easy to read, because fitting words to thoughts. Among all the ancient writers Thucydides attracted him most, and he seems to have set himself early to the work of translation, wishing others to share in the pleasure and instruction he derived from his favourite’s pages. But when he had finished his work he kept it lying by him for years, being no longer so sure of finding appreciative readers; and when he did send it forth at last, in 1628, he was fain to be content with “the few and better sort.”^[2. The translation, under the title Eight Books of the Peloponnesian War, written by Thucydides the son of Olorus, interpreted with faith and diligence immediately out of the Greek by Thomas Hobbes, secretary to the late Earl of Devonshire, appeared in 1628 (given also as 1629), after the death of the earl, to whom touching reference is made in the dedication. It reappeared in 1634, with the date of the dedication altered, as if then newly written. Though Hobbes claims to have performed his work “with much more diligence than elegance,” his version is remarkable as a piece of English writing, but is by no meaus accurate. It fills vols, viii. and ix. in Molesworth’s collection (11 vols., including index vol.) of Hobbes’s English Works (London, Bohn, 1839-45). The volumes of this collection will here be cited as E. W. Molesworth’s collection of the Latin Opera Philosophica (5 vols., 1839-45) will be cited as L. W. The five hundred and odd Latin hexameters under the title De Mirabilibus Pecci (L. W., v. 323-40), giving an account of a short excursion from Chatsworth to view the seven wonders of the Derbyshire Peak, were written before 1628 (in 1626 or 1627), though not published till 1636. A later edition, in 1678, included an English version by another hand. ] That he was finally determined to pub lication by the political troubles of the year 1628 may be regarded as certain, not only from his own express declaration at a later time (F⅛. carm. exp.}, but also from unmistakable hints in the account of the life and work of his author prefixed to the translation on its appearance. 1628 was the year of the Petition of Right, extorted by the popular leaders from a reluctant king in the third parliament he had tried within three years of his accession; and, in view of Hobbes’s later activity, it is very significant that just then he should come forward, at the mature age of forty, with his version of the impressive story of the Athenian democracy as the first production of his pen. Nothing else is known of his doings before 1628, except that through his connexion with young Cavendish, who from about the year 1619 became an important social and political figure, he had relations with literary men of note like Ben Jonson, and also with the two philosophical thinkers who before himself rendered the English name illustrious in the 17th century—Bacon and Lord Herbert of Cherbury. If he never had any sympathy with Herbert’s intuitionalist principles in philosophy, he was no less eager, as he afterwards showed, than Herbert to rationalize in matters of religious doctrine, so that he may with the same reason be called the second of the English deists as Herbert has been called the first. With Bacon there is evidence of his having been so intimate (Aubrey’s Lives, pp. 222, 602) that it is not surprising that some writers have been betrayed into describing him as the disciple and follower of the great Instaurator. The facts as recorded, however,—that he used sometimes to walk with Bacon at Gorhambury, and would jot down with exceptional intelligence the eager thinker’s sudden “notions,” also that he was employed to make the Latin version of some of the Essays,— prove nothing of the sort, when weighed against his own disregard of all Bacon’s most characteristic principles, and the other evidence that the impulse to independent philosophical thinking came to him not from Bacon, and not till some time after Bacon’s death in 1626.^[3. Hobbes, in minor works dealing with physical questions (Z. W., iv. p. 316; E. W., vii. p. 112), makes two incidental references to Bacon’s writings, but never mentions Bacon as he mentions Galileo, Kepler, Harvey, and others (De Corpore, ep. ded.), among the lights of the century. The word “Induction,” which occurs in only three or four passages throughout all his works (and these again minor ones), is never used by him with the faintest reminiscence of the import assigned to it by Bacon; and, as will be seen, he had nothing but scorn for experimental work in physics. ].

So far as we have any positive evidence, it was not before the year 1629 that Hobbes first entered on the path of philosophical inquiry; and meanwhile a great change had been wrought in his outer life. His friend and master, after only about two years’ tenure of the earldom, fell a sudden victim to the plague in June 1628; and the affairs of the Devonshire family having become greatly disordered by lavish expenditure, the widowed countess was left with the task of righting them in the boyhood of the third earl. Hobbes went on for a time living in the household; but his services were no longer in demand as before, and, remaining inconsolable under his personal bereavement, he sought distraction, in 1629, in another engagement which took him abroad as tutor to the son of Sir Gervase Clifton, of an old Notts family. This, his second, sojourn abroad appears to have been spent chiefly in Paris, and the one important fact recorded of it is that he then first began to look into Euclid. Sojourn and engagement came to an end together in 1631, when he was recalled to train the young earl of Devonshire, now thirteen years old, as he never had had an opportunity of training the boy’s father. In the course of the next [9:12:33] seven years Hobbes took his young pupil over rhetoric,^[4. The free English abstract of Aristotle’s Rhetoric, published in 1681, after Hobbes’s death, as The Whole Art of Rhetoric (E. IK., vi. pp. 423-510), corresponds with a Latin version dictated to his young pupil. Among Hobbes's papers preserved at Hardwick, where he died, there remains the boy’s dictation-book, interspersed with headings, examples, &c., in Hobbes’s hand. ] logic, astronomy, and the principles of law, with other subjects. Most probably their life for the first three years was in Derbyshire, till they went abroad in the middle of 1634. They remained away till the spring of 1637, and Hobbes went over much the same ground as in his first journey, but now in a very different frame of mind. His head was now full of the thought of motion in nature, and whenever he could meet with the philosophical speculators or scientific workers who were then with a new-born ardour seeking for a clue to the secret of the physical world, none so forward to consort with them as he. He was still in time to pay his respects to the aged Galileo, for whom he conceived and ever retained the warmest admiration; and on the way homewards he spent no less than eight months in daily converse with the members of a busy scientific circle in Paris, held together by the genial influence of the Père Mersenne. From that time (the winter of 1636-7) he too, as he tells us, was numbered among philosophers.

It is not impossible to trace a little more exactly the steps by which Hobbes reached this consummation when he was just touching his fiftieth year. There can be no doubt, it seems, that his introduction to Euclid took place in 1629, and according to Aubrey, who tells the story with a quaint dramatic vigour {Lives, p. 604), the introduction was quite accidental. Euclid’s manner of proof was as a revelation to him, and it became the model for his own way of thinking upon all subjects ever after; nor was he content till he too could be seen at work solving questions of geometry with as much confidence as if he had been, like Descartes, an accomplished mathematician from his boyhood. It is less easy to determine when he awoke to an interest in the physical doctrine of motion. The story told by himself {Vit., p. xx.) is that, being struck one day in a company of learned men by the question, What is sense? which some one asked and nobody could answer, he fell to thinking often on the subject, till it suddenly occurred to him that if bodies and their internal parts were at rest, or were always in the same state of motion, there could be no distinction of anything, and consequently no sense; the cause of all things must, therefore, he presumed, be sought in diversity of movements, and starting from this principle he was driven to geometry for insight into the ground and modes of motion. Unfortunately no date or place is given; but if it may be supposed that he must already have known something of geometry to understand its bearing on the study of motion, the scene or at least the conclusion to which it led should be referred to some time after his casual introduction to Euclid. It is even suggested in one or two of the biographical narratives that the new mental advance was not made till the time of the third journey. Nothing is said, however, which should exclude another account, that on the third journey he began to study the doctrine of motion more seriously, being interested in it before; and as he claims more than once {L. W., v. p. 303; E. W., vii. p. 468) to have explained light and sound by a mechanical hypothesis as far back as 1630, the company-scene (which is more likely to have occurred abroad than in England) and the sudden inspiration may perhaps more safely be assigned to the time of the second journey. But it was not till the third journey that the new interest became an overpowering passion, and the “philosopher” was on his way home before he had advanced so far as to conceive the scheme of a system of thought to the elaboration of which his life should henceforth be devoted.

Hobbes was able to carry out his plan in some twenty years or more from the time of its conception, but the execution was so broken in upon by the dire political events that happened from the year 1637, and became so complicated with other labours, that its stages can hardly be followed without some previous understanding of the relations of the parts of the scheme, as there is reason to believe they were sketched out from the beginning. And there is the more need for some preliminary statement because at least one of the parts—the doctrine of Sian—is far more effectively wrought out in other works than in the treatise De Homine, which professes to contain the formal exposition of it. Hobbes’s notion was that the whole body of philosophical truth should be disposed in three sections, dealing progressively with Body, Man, and State or Society. An anxious political observer before he became a philosopher, he was supremely interested in the problem of con duct; but the philosopher could not be satisfied till the foundations of settled social life were based deep in the constitution of human nature; and his new philosophical insight revealed to him the need and the possibility of interpreting the facts of human nature by what had begun to be known of physical nature generally. He would therefore first work out, in a separate treatise De Corporc, a systematic doctrine of Body, showing how physical phenomena were universally explicable in terms of motion, as motion or mechanical action was now (through Galileo and others) understood, —the theory of motion being applied in the light of mathematical science, after quantity, the subject-matter of mathematics, had been duly considered in its place among the fundamental conceptions of philosophy, and a clear indication had been given, at first starting, of the logical ground and method of all philosophical inquiry. He would then single out Man from the realm ol nature, and, in a treatise De Hornine, show what specific bodily motions were involved in the production of the peculiar phenomena of sensation and knowledge, as also of the affections and passions thence resulting, whereby man came into relation with man. Finally he would consider, in a crowning treatise De Civc, how men, being naturally rivals or foes, were moved to enter into the better relation of Society, and demonstrate how this grand and beneficent product of human wit must be regulated if men were not to fall back into brutishness and misery. Such, in briefest summary, was the scheme conceived, at a time of new intellectual expansion, with reference to a threatening movement of social upheaval. We are now to see how it fared in the execution.

Hobbes came home, in 1637, to a country seething with discontent. The reign of “Thorough” was collapsing, and the forces pent up since 1629 were soon to rend the fabric of the English state to pieces. In February Hampden’s case began to be tried; in July broke out the Edinburgh riot over Laud’s prayer-book; next year was formed the Solemn League and Covenant; the year after the rebel Scots had the king at their mercy in the open field; and finally, in the spring of 1640, with a new prospect of war, Charles had no resource left but once more, after eleven years of personal rule, to call a parliament. Such a rush of events was but too likely to overpower Hobbes’s resolution to work up to social problems from abstract questions of body and space and motion, and there is clear evidence that he was soon distracted from the orderly execution of his philosophic plan. The Short Parliament, as he tells us himself at a later time {E. IK., iv. p. 414), was not dissolved, in three weeks from the time of its meeting, before he had ready “a little treatise in English,” in which he sought to prove that the points of the royal prerogative which the members were determined to dispute before granting supplies, “were inseparably annexed to the sovereignty which they did not then deny to be in the king.” Now it can be proved that at this time he had written not only his Human Nature but also his De Corpore Politico, the two treatises, though published separately ten years later, having been composed as parts of one work;^[5. Among the Hardwick papers there is preserved a MS. copy of the work, under the title Elementes of Law Naturali and Politique, with the dedication to the earl of Newcastle, written in Hobbes’s own hand, and dated May 9, 1640. This dedication was prefixed to the first thirteen chapters of the work when printed by themselves, under the title Human Nature, in 1650. ] and there cannot be the least question that together they make “the little treatise” just mentioned. We are therefore to understand, first, that he wrote the earliest draft of his political theory some years before the outbreak of the Civil War, and, secondly, that this earliest draft was not written till, in accordance with his philosophical conception, he had established the grounds of polity in human nature. The first point is to be noted, because it has often been supposed that Hobbes’s political doctrine took its peculiar complexion from his revulsion against the state of anarchy before his eyes, as lie wrote during the progress of the Civil War. The second point must be maintained against his own implied, if not express, statement some years later, when publishing his De Cive (L. W., ii. p. 151), that he wrote this third part of his system before he had [9:12:34] been able to set down any finished representation of the fundamental doctrines which it presupposed. If his philosophical plans were disordered and the doctrine of Body was still in the air, he had, in the beginning of 1640, written out his doctrine of Man at least, with almost as much elaboration as it ever received from him.

When, in six months more, the Long Parliament succeeded to the Short, and set to work at once by sending Laud and Strafford to the Tower, Hobbes, who had become, or thought he had become, a marked man by the circulation of his treatise (of which, “though not printed, many gentlemen had copies ”), instantly took fright and hasted away to Paris. He was now for the fourth and last time abroad, and did not see England again for eleven years. Apparently he remained the greater part of the time in or about Paris, though he can be traced to Rouen in 1646. In Paris he was welcomed back into the old scientific coterie about Mersenne, and forthwith had the task assigned him of criticizing the Meditations of Descartes, which had been sent from Holland, before publication, to Mersenne with the author’s request for criticism from the most different points of view. Hobbes was soon ready with the remarks that were printed as “Third” among the six (later seven) sets of “Objections” appended, with “Replies” from Descartes, to the Meditations, when published shortly afterwards in 1641 (reprinted in L. JV., v. pp. 249-74). About the same time also Mersenne sent to Descartes, as if they came from a friend in England, another set of objections which Hobbes had to offer on various points in the scientific treatises, especially the Dioptrics, appended by Descartes to his Discourse on Method in 1637; to which Descartes replied without suspecting the common authorship of the two sets. The result in both cases was to keep the two thinkers apart rather than bring them together. Hobbes was more eager to bring forward his own philosophical and physical ideas, over which he had now been brooding for ten years, than careful to enter into the full meaning of another’s thought; and Descartes was by nature too jealous, and had become too confident in his hard-won conclusions, to be able to bear with this kind of criticism. He was very curt in his replies to Hobbes’s philosophical objections, and after a little impatiently broke off all correspondence on the physical questions, writing privately to Mersenne (who had continued to act as intermediary) that he had grave doubts of the Englishman’s good faith in drawing him into controversy (Z. JV., v. pp. 277-307).

Meanwhile Hobbes, however eager he might be to keep himself abreast of the general philosophical movement of the time, had his thoughts too full of the political theory which the rush of events in the last years had ripened within him, to be able to settle, even in Paris, to the orderly composition of his systematic works. Though connected in his own mind with his view of human nature and of nature generally, the political theory, as he always declared, could stand by itself. Also, while he may have hoped at this time to be able to add much (though he never did add much) to the first popular sketch of his doctrine of Man contained in the unpublished “little treatise,” he might extend, but could hardly otherwise modify, the sketch he had there given of his carefully articulated theory of Body Politic. Possibly, indeed, before that sketch was written early in 1640, he may, under pressure of the political excitement, have advanced no small way in the actual composition of the treatise De Cive, the third section of his projected system. In any case, it was upon this section, before the others, that he set to work as soon as he was fixed in Paris; and before the end of 1641 the book, as we know from the date of the dedication (November 1), was finished. He determined, however, though it was forthwith printed in the course of the year 1642, not to commit himself to formal publication, but was content to circulate a limited number of copies privately;^[6. The book, of which the copies are rare (one in Dr Williams’s library in London), was printed in quarto size (Paris, 1642.), with a pictorial title-page (not afterwards reproduced) of scenes and figures illustrating its three divisions, “Libertas,” “Imperium,” “Religio.” The title Elementorum Philosophies Sectio Τertiα, De Cive, expresses its relation to the unwritten sections, which also comes out in one or two back-references in the text. ] and when he found his work received with great applause by his friends (it was praised even by Descartes), he seems to have taken this recognition of his philosophical achievement as but a reason the more for deferring publication till the earlier works of the system were completed. Accordingly, for the next three or four years, he remained steadily at work, and nothing appeared from him in public except a short treatise on optics {Tractatus Opticus, L. W., v. pp. 217-248) included in the collection of scientific tracts published by Mersenne under the title Coyitata Physicο-Mathematica in 1644, and a highly compressed statemeut of his psychological application of the doctrine of motion {L. IK., v. pp. 309-318), incorporated with Mersennes Ballistica, published in the same year. Thus or otherwise he had become sufficiently known by 1645 to be chosen, with Descartes, Roberval, and others, a referee in a once famous controversy between Pell, an English mathematician in Amsterdam, and the Dane Longomontanus, over that problem of the quadrature of the circle which was seeu later on to have such a fatal charm for himself. But though about this time he had got ready all or most of the materials for his fundamental work on Body, not even now was he able to make way with its composition. New distractions came to tear him away from the orderly execution of the fundamental part of his scheme, and when he returned to it after a number of years, he returned a different man.

The Civil War had broken out in the middle of 1642, and, after a period of varying fortunes on either side, the royalist cause began to decline from the time of the defeat of the marquis of Newcastle at Marston Moor, in the middle of 1644. Then commenced an exodus of the king’s friends. Newcastle himself, a cousin of Hobbes’s dead master and the patron to whom he dedicated the “little treatise” of 1640, found his way to Paris, and was followed, especially after the decisive defeat at Naseby in June 1645, by an ever increasing stream of fugitives, many of whom were known to Hobbes from former days. The sight of these exiles, from whom he learned all the details of the fierce work that had been going on in England while he was quietly busy with his studies in Paris, made the political interest once more predominant in Hobbes, and before long the revived feeling issued in the formation· of a new and important design. It first showed itself in the publication of the De Give, of which the fame, but only the fame, had extended beyond the inner circle of friends and critics who had copies of the original impression. Hobbes now entrusted it, early in 1646, to his admirer, the Frenchman Sorbière, by -whom it was seen through the Elzevir press at Amsterdam in 1647,—having previously inserted a number of notes in reply to objections, and also a striking preface, in the course of which he explained its relation to the other parts of the system not yet forthcoming, and the (political) occasion of its having been composed and being now published before them.^[7. L. IP., ii. pp. 133-134. In this first public edition (12mo), the title was changed to Elementa Philosophica de Cive, the references in the text to the previous sections being omitted. The date of the dedication to the young earl of Devonshire was altered from 1641 to 1646. ] So hopeless, meanwhile, was he growing of being able to return home that, later on in the year, he was on the point of leaving Paris to take [9:12:35] up his abode in the south with a French friend,^[8. Described as “nobilis Languedocianus” in Vit. ; doubtless the same with the “Dominus Verdusius, nobilis Aquitanus,” to whom was dedicated the Exam, et Emend. Math. Ηοd. (L.W., iv.) in 1660. Du Verdus was one of Hobbes’s profoundest admirers and most frequent correspondents in later years; there are many of his letters among Hobbes’s papers at Hardwick. ] when he was induced to remain as mathematical instructor to the young prince of Wales, who had come over from Jersey about the month of July. Thus thrown more than ever into the company of the exiled royalists, it was then, if not earlier, that he conceived his new design of bringing ull his powers of thought and expression to bear upon the production of an English book that should set forth his whole theory of civil government in relation to the stupendous political crisis resulting from the war. The De Give, presently to be published, was written in Latin for the learned, and gave the political theory without its foundation in human nature. The unpublished treatise of 1640 contained all or nearly all that lie had to tell concerning human nature, but was written before the terrible events of the last years had disclosed how men might still be urged by their anti-social passions back into the abyss of anarchy. There was need of an exposition at once comprehensive, incisive, and popular. Tiιe State, it now seemed to Hobbes, might be regarded as a great artificial man or monster (Leviathan), composed of men, with a life that might be traced from its generation through human reason under pressure of human needs to its dissolution through civil strife proceeding from human passions. This, we may suppose, was the presiding conception from the first, but the design may have been variously modified in the three or four years of its execution. Before the end, in 1650-1, it is plain that he wrote in direct reference to the greatly changed aspect of affairs in England. The king being no more, and the royalist cause appearing to be hopelessly lost, he did not scruple, in closing the work with a general “Review and Conclusion,” to raise the question of the subject’s right to change allegiance when a former sovereign’s power to protect was irrecoverably gone. Also he took advantage of the lax rule of the Commonwealth to indulge much more freely than he might have otherwise dared in rationalistic criticism of religious doctrines; while, amid the turmoil of sects, he could the more forcibly urge that the preservation of social order, when again firmly restored, must depend on the assumption by the civil power of the right to wield all sanctions, supernatural as well as natural, against the pretensions of any clergy, Catholic, Anglican, or Presbyterian, to the exercise of an imperium in imperio. We know the Leviathan only as it finally emerged from Hobbes’s pen. During the years of its composition he remained in or near Paris, at first in attendance on his royal pupil, with whom he became a great favourite. The engagement must in any case have come to an end in the year 1648, when the prince removed to Holland, but it was probably broken off earlier by an illness that overtook Hobbes in 1647 and disabled him for six months. On recovering from this illness, which nearly proved fatal, he resumed his literary task, and carried it steadily forward to completion by the year 1650, having also within the same time translated into English, with characteristic force of expression, his Latin treatise. Otherwise the only thing known (from one or two letters) of his life in those years is that from the year 1648 he had begun to think of returning home; he was then sixty, and might well be weary of exile. When 1650 came, as if to prepare the way for the reception of his magnum opus, he allowed the publication of his earliest treatise, divided into two separate small volumes (Human Nature, or the Fundamental Elements of Policy, E. W., iv. pp. 1 -7 6, and De Corpore Politico, or the Elements of Law, Moral and Politic, pp. 77-228).^[9. The Human Nature corresponds with cc. i-xiii of the first part of the original treatise. The remaining six chapters of the part stand now as Part I. of the De Corpore Politico. Part II. of the D. C. P. corresponds with the original second part of the whole work. ] In 1651^[10. At the beginning of this year he wrote and published in Paris a letter on the nature and conditions of poetry, chiefly epic, in answer to an appeal to his judgment made in the preface to Sir W. Davenant's heroic poem, Gondibeτt (E. W r ∙,iv. pp. 441-58). The letter is dated Jam 10, 1650 (165?). ] he published his translation of the De Give under the title of Philosophical Rudiments concerning Government and Society (E. W., ii.). Meanwhile the printing of the greater work was proceeding, and finally it appeared about the middle of the same year, 1651, under the title of Leviathan, or the Matter, Form, and Power of a Commonwealth, Ecclesiastical and Civil (E. W., iii.), with a quaint frontispiece in which, from behind hills overlooking a fair landscape of town and country, there towered the body (above the waist) of a crowned giant, made up of tiny figures of human beings and bearing sword and crozier in the two hands. It appeared, and soon its author was more lauded and decried than any other thinker of his time; but the first effect of its publication was to sever his connexion with the exiled royalist party, and to throw him for protection on the revolutionary Government. No sooner did copies of the book reach Paris than he found himself shunned by his former associates, and though he was himself so little conscious of disloyalty that he was forward to present a manuscript copy “engrossed in vellum in a marvellous fair hand”^[11. This presentation copy, so described by Clarendon (Survey of the Leviathan, 1676, p. 8), is doubtless the beautifully written and finely bound MS. noλv to be found in the British Museum (Egerton MSS. 1910). ] to the young king of the Scots (who, after the defeat at Worcester, escaped to Paris about the end of October), he was denied the royal presence when he sought it shortly afterwards. Straightway, then, he saw himself exposed to a double peril. The exiles had among them desperadoes who could slay; and, besides exciting the enmity of the Anglican clergy about the king, who bitterly resented the secularist spirit of his book, he had compromised himself with the French authorities by his elaborate attack on the papal system. In the circumstances, no resource; was left him but secret flight. Travelling with what speed he could in the depths of a severe winter and under the effects of a recent (second) illness, he managed to reach London, where, sending in his submission to the council of state, he was allowed without trouble to subside into private life.

Though Hobbes came back, after his eleven years’ absence, without having as yet publicly proved his title to rank with the natural philosophers of the age, he was sufficiently conscious of what he had been able to achieve in Leviathan; and it was in no humble mood that he now, at the age of sixty-four, turned to complete the fundamental treatise of his philosophical system. Neither were those whom his masterpiece soon roused to enthusiasm, or those whom it moved to indignation, likely to be indifferent to anything he should now write, whether it lay near to or far from the region of practice. Taking up his abode in London on his return, and continuing to reside there for the sake of intellectual society, even after renewing his old ties with the earl of Devonshire, who lived in the country till the Restoration,^[12. During all the time he was abroad he had continued to receive from his patron a yearly pension of £80, and they remained in steady correspondence. The earl, having sided with the king in 1642, was declared unfit to sit in the House of Peers, and though, by submission to Parliament, he recovered his estates when they were sequestered later on, he did not sit again till 1660. Among Hobbes’s friends at this time are specially mentioned Selden and Harvey, who each left him a legacy of £10 on dying, Selden in 1654 and Harvey in 1657. Harvey (not Bacon) is the only Englishman he mentions in the dedicatory epistle prefixed to the De Corpore, among the founders, before himself, of the new natural philosophy. ] he worked so steadily upon the [9:12:36] materials he had long had by him as to be printing the De Corpore in the year 1654. Circumstances (of which more presently), however, kept the book back till the following year, and meanwhile the readers of Leviathan had a different excitement. In 1654 a small treatise, Of Liberty and Necessity (E. JK,iv. pp. 229-278), issued from the press, claiming to be an answer to a discourse on the same subject by Bishop Bramhall of Londonderry, addressed by Hobbes to the marquis of Newcastle.^[13. The treatise bore the date, “Rouen, Aug. 20, 1652,” but it should have been 1646, as afterwards explained by Hobbes himself (E.W., V. p. 25). ] It was really such, and had grown out of an oral discussion between Hobbes and Bramhall in the marquis’s presence at Paris in 1646,—Bramhall, a strong Arminian, having afterwards written down his views and sent them to Newcastle to be answered in this form by Hobbes, and Hobbes having duly replied, but not for publication, because he thought the subject a delicate one. Unpublished, accordingly, the piece remained; but it happened that Hobbes, in the interval between writing his own reply and receiving from the bishop in 1647 a rejoinder which he left unanswered, allowed a French acquaintance to have a private translation of his reply made by a young Englishman, who secretly took also a copy of the original for himself; and now it was this unnamed purloiner who, in 1654, when Hobbes had become famous and feared, gave it to the world of his own motion, with an extravagantly laudatory epistle to the reader in its front. Upon Hobbes himself the publication came as a surprise, but, after his plain speaking in Leviathan, there was nothing in the piece that he need scruple to have made known, and he seems to have readily enough condoned the offender’s act. On the other hand, Bramhall, supposing Hobbes privy to the publication, might well resent the manner of it, especially as no mention was made of his rejoinder. Accordingly, in 1655, he printed everything that had passed between them (under the title of A Defence of the True Liberty of Human Actions from Antecedent or Extrinsic Necessity), with loud complaint against the treatment he had received, and the promise added that, in default of others, he himself would stand forward to expose the deadly principles of Leviathan. About this time Hobbes had begun to be hard pressed by other foes, and, being never more sure of himself than upon the question of the will, he appears to have welcomed the opportunity thus given him of showing his strength. By 1656 he was ready with his Questions concerning Liberty, Necessity, and Chance (E. W., v.), in which he replied with astonishing force to the bishop’s rejoinder point by point, besides explaining the occasion and circumstances of the whole debate, and reproducing (as Bramhall had done) all the pieces from the beginning. As perhaps the first clear exposition and defence of the psychological doctrine of determinism, Hobbes’s own two pieces must ever retain a classical importance in the history of the freewill controversy; while Bramhall’s are still worth study as specimens of scholastic fence. The bishop, it should be added, returned to the charge in 1658 with ponderous Castigations of Hobbeds Animadversions, and also made good his previous threat in a bulky appendix entitled The Catching of Leviathan the Great Whale. Hobbes never took any notice of the Castigations, but ten years later replied to the charges of atheism, &c., made in the nonpolitical part of the appendix, of which he says he then heard for the first time (E. W., iv. pp. 279-384. This Answer was first published after Hobbes’s death. Bramhall had died, as archbishop of Armagh, in 1663).^[14. A little tract by Bishop Laney of Ely, directed against the concluding summary in Hobbes’s original statement to Newcastle, was published in 1676, and called forth a printed reply from Hobbes, again addressed to Newcastle (who had meanwhile become duke). This letter is not reprinted by Molesworth. ]

We may now follow out the more troublesome conflict, or rather series of conflicts, in which Hobbes became entangled from the time of publishing his De Corpore in 1655, and which checkered all his remaining years. In Leviathan he had vehemently assailed the system of the universities, as originally founded for the support of the papal against the civil authority, and as still working social mischief by adherence to the old learning. The attack was duly noted at Oxford, where under the Commonwealth a new spirit of scientific activity had begun to stir; and in 1654 Seth Ward, the Savilian professor of astronomy, replying in his Vindiciae Academiarum to some other assaults (then very common) on the academic system, retorted upon Hobbes that, so far from the universities being now what he had known them in his youth, he would find his geometrical pieces, tvhen they appeared, better understood there than he should like. This was said in reference to the boasts in which Hobbes seems to have been freely indulging of having squared the circle and accomplished other such feats; and, when a year later the Be Cotpore (L. W. , i. ) finally appeared, it was seen how the thrust had gone home. In the chapter (xx.) of that work where Hobbes dealt with the famous problem whose solution he fondly thought he had found, there were left some self-complacent expressions vented against Vindex (Ward) at a time when the solutions still seemed to him good; but the solutions themselves, as printed, were allowed to be all in different ways halting, as he naively confessed he had discovered only when he had been driven by the insults of malevolent men to examine them more closely with the help of his friends. A strange conclusion this, and reached by a path not less strange, as was now to be disclosed by a relentless hand. Ward’s colleague, the more famous John Wallis, Savilian professor of geometry, had been privy to the challenge thrown out in 1654, and it was arranged that they should critically dispose of the Be Corpore between them. Ward was to occupy himself with the philosophical and physical sections, which he did in leisurely fashion, bringing out his criticism in the course of next year {In Th. Ηobbii Philosophiam Exercitatio Epistolica). Wallis was to confine himself to the mathematical chapters, and set to tvork at once with characteristic energy. Obtaining an unbound copy of the Be Cotpore, he saw by the mutilated appearance of the sheets that Hobbes had repeatedly altered his demonstrations before he issued them at last in their actual form, grotesque as it was, rather than delay the book longer. Obtaining also a copy of the work as it had been printed before Hobbes had any doubt of the validity of his solutions, Wallis was able to track his whole course from the time of Ward’s provocation—his passage from exultation to doubt, from doubt to confessed impotence, yet still without abandoning the old assumption of confident strength; and all Ids turnings and windings were now laid bare in one of the most trenchant pieces of controversial writing ever penned. Wallis’s Elenchus Geometries Hobbianoe, published in 1655 about three months after the Be Corpore, contained also an elaborate criticism of Hobbes’s whole attempt to relay the foundations of mathematical science in its place within the general body of reasoned knowledge—a criticism which, if it failed to allow for the merit of the conception, exposed only too effectually the utter inadequacy of the result. Taking up mathematics when not only his mind was already formed but his thoughts were crystallizing into a philosophical system, Hobbes had, in fact, never put himself to school and sought to work up gradually to the best knowledge of the time, but had been more anxious from the first to become himself an innovator with whatever insufficient means. The consequence was that, when not spending himself in vain attempts to solve the impossible problems that have always waylaid the fancy of self-sufficient beginners, he took an interest only in the elements of geometry, and never had any notion of the full scope of mathematical science, undergoing as it then was (and not least at the hands of Wallis) the extraordinary development which made it before the end of the century the potent instrument of physical discovery which it became in the hands of Newton. He xvas even unable, in dealing with the elementary conceptions of geometιy, to work out with any consistency the few original thoughts he had, and thus became the easy sport of Wallis. At his advanced age, however, and with the sense he had of his powers, he was not likely tö be brought to a better mind by so insulting an opponent. He did indeed, before allowing an English translation of the Be Corpore {E. TV. , i. ) to appear in 1656, take care to remove some of the worst mistakes exposed by Wallis, and, while leaving out all the references to Vindex, now profess to make, in altered form, a series of mere “attempts” at quadrature; hut he was far from yielding the ground to the enemy. With the translation,^[15. This translation, Concerning Body, though not made by Hobbes, was revised by him; but it is far from accurate, and not seldom, at critical places {eg., c. vi. § 2), quite misleading. Philosophical citations from the De Corpore should always be made in the original Latin. Molesworth reprints the Latin, not from the first edition of 1655, but from the modified edition of 1668—modified, in the mathe- ] in the spring of 1656, he had ready Six Lessons to the [9:12:37] Professors of Mathematics, one of Geometry, the other of Astronomy, in the University of Oxford (E. W., vii. pp. 181-356), in which, after reasserting his view of the principles of geometry in opposition to Euclid’s, he proceeded to repel Wallis’s objections with no lack of dialectical skill, and with an unreserve equal to Wallis’s own. He did not scruple, in the ardour of conflict, even to maintain positions that he had resigned in the translation, and he was not afraid to assume the offensive by a counter criticism of three of Wallis’s works then published. When he had thus disposed of the “Paralogisms” of his more formidable antagonist in the first five lessons, he ended with a lesson on “Manners” to the two professors together, and set himself gravely at the close to show that he too could be abusive. In this particular part of his task, it must be allowed, he succeeded very well; his criticism of Wallis’s works, especially the great treatise Arithmetica Infinitorum (1655), only showed how little able he was to enter into the meaning of the modern analysis. Wallis, on his side, was not less ready to keep up the game in English than he had been to begin it in Latin. Swift as before to strike, in three months’ time he had deftly turned his own word against the would-be master by administering Due Correction for Mr Hobbes, or School Discipline for not saying his Lessons right, in a piece that differed from the Elenchus only in being more biting and unrestrained. Having an easy task in defending himself against Hobbes’s trivial criticism, he seized the opportunity given him by the English translation of the De Corpore to track Hobbes again step by step over the whole course, and now to confront him with his incredible inconsistencies multiplied by every new utterance. But it was no longer a fight over mathematical questions only. Wallis having been betrayed originally by his fatal cleverness into the pettiest carping at words, Hobbes had retorted in kind, and then it became a high duty in the other to defend his Latin with great parade of learning and give fresh provocation. One of Wallis s rough sallies in this kind suggested to Hobbes the title of the next rejoinder with which, in 1657, he sought to close the unseemly wrangle. Arguing in the Lessons that a mathematical point must have quantity, though this were not reckoned, he had explained the Greek word στlyμη, used for a point, to mean a visible mark made with a hot iron; whereupon he was charged by Wallis with gross ignorance for confounding στιyμh and στiyμa. Hence the title of his new piece :— 2τιyμai ’ Ayeωμeτρias, ’ Ayρoικias, ’ Auτιπo∖ιτdas, ' Aμaθeias, or Marks of the Absurd Geometry, Rural Language, Scottish Church Politics, and Barbarisms of John Wallis, Professor of Geometry and Doctor of Divinity (E. W., vii. pp. 357-400). He now attacked more in detail but not more happily than before Wallis’s great work, while hardly attempting any further defence of his own positions; also he repelled with some force and dignity the insults that had been heaped upon him, and fought the verbal points, but could not leave the field without making political insinuations against his adversary, quite irrelevant in themselves and only noteworthy as evidence of his own resignation to Cromwell’s rule. The thrusts were easily and nimbly parried by Wallis in a reply (Hobbiani Puncti Dispunctio, 1657) occupied mainly with the verbal questions. Irritating as it was, it did not avail to shake Hobbes’s determination to remain silent; and thus at last there was peace for a time.

Before the strife flamed up again, Hobbes had published, in 1658, the outstanding section of his philosophical system, and thus completed, after a fashion, the scheme he had planned more than twenty years before. So far as the treatise De Homine (L. W., ii. pp. 1-132) was concerned, the completion was more in name than in fact. It consisted for the most part of an elaborate theory of vision which, though very creditable to Hobbes’s scientific insight, was out of place, or at least out of proportion, in a philosophical consideration of human nature generally. The remainder of the treatise, dealing cursorily with some of the topics more fully treated in the Human Nature and the Leviathan, has all the appearance of having been tagged in haste to the optical chapters (composed years before)^[16. They were composed originally, in a somewhat different and rather more extended form, as the second part of an English treatise on Optics, completed by the year 1646. Of this treatise, preserved in Harleian MSS. 3360, Molesworth otherwise prints the dedication to the marquis of Newcastle, and the concluding paragraphs (E. IF., vii. ] as a makeshift for the proper transition required in the system from questions of Body Natural to questions of Body Politic. Hobbes had in fact spent himself in his earlier constructive efforts, and at the age of seventy, having nothing to add to his doctrine of Man as it was already in one form or another before the world, was content with anything that might stand for the fulfilment of his philosophical purpose. But he had still in him more than twenty years of vigorous vitality, and, not conscious to himself of any shortcoming, looked forward, now his hands were free, to doing battle for his doctrines. Rather than remain quiet, on finding no notice taken of his latest production, he would himself force on a new conflict with the enemy. Wallis having meanwhile published other works and especially a comprehensive treatise on the general prinβiples of calculus (Mathesis Universalis, 1657), he might take this occasion of exposing afresh the new-fangled methods of mathematical analysis and reasserting his own earlier positions. Accordingly, by the spring of 1660, he had managed to put his criticism and assertions into five dialogues under the title Examinatio et Emendatio Mathematicce Hodiernae qualis explicatur in Libris Johannis Wallisii, with a sixth dialogue so called, consisting almost entirely of seventy or more propositions on the circle and cycloid.^[17. L. IF., iv. pp. 1-232. The propositions on the circle, forty-six in number (shattered by Wallis in 1662), were omitted by Hobbes when he republished the Dialogues in 1668, in the collected edition of his Latin works from which Molesworth reprints. In the part omitted, at p. 154 of the original edition, Hobbes refers to his first introduction to Euclid, in a way that confirms the story in Aubrey quoted in an earlier paragraph. ] Wallis, however, would not take the bait. Hobbes then tried another tack. Next year, having solved, as he thought, another ancient crux, the duplication of the cube, he had his solution brought out anonymously at Paris in French, so as to put Wallis and other critics off the scent and extort a judgment that might be withheld from a work of his. The artifice was successful, and no sooner had Wallis publicly refuted the solution than Hobbes claimed the credit of it, and went more wonderfully than ever astray in its defence. He presently republished it (in modified form), with his remarks, at the end of a new Latin dialogue which he had meanwhile written in defence of another part of his philosophical doctrine. This was the Dialogus Physicus, sive De Natura Aeris (L. W., iv. pp. 233-296), fulminated in 1661 against Boyle and other friends of Wallis λvho, as he fancied, under the influence of that malevolent spirit, were now in London, after the Restoration, forming themselves into a society (incorporated as the Royal Society in 1662) for experimental research, to the exclusion of himself personally, and in direct contravention of the method of physical inquiry enjoined in the De Corpore ^[18. Remaining at Oxford, Wallis, in fact, took no active part in the constitution of the new society, but he had been, from 1645, one of the originators of an earlier association in London, thus continued or revived. This earlier society had been continued also at Oxford after the year 1649, when Wallis and others of its members received appointments there. ] J All the laborious manipulation recorded in Boyle’s New Experiments touching the Spring of the Air (1660), which Hobbes chose, without the least warrant, to take as the manifesto of the new “academicians,” seemed to him only to confirm the conclusions he had reasoned out years before from speculative principles, and he warned them that if they were not content to begin where he had left off their work would come to nought. To as much of this diatribe as concerned himself Boyle quickly replied with force and dignity, but it was from Hobbes’s old enemy that retribution came, in the scathing satire Hobbiιιs Heauton·timorumenos (1662). Wallis, who had deftly steered his course amid all the political changes of the previous years, managing ever to be on the side of the ruling power, was now apparently stung to fury by a wanton allusion in Hobbes’s latest dialogue to a passage of his former life (his deciphering for the Parliament the king s papers taken at.Naseby), whereof he had once boasted but after the Restoration could not speak or hear too little. The revenge he took was crashing. Professing to be roused by the attack on his friend Boyle, when he had scorned to lift a finger in defence of himself against the earlier dialogues, he tore them all to shreds with an art of which no general description can give an idea. He got, however, upon more dangerous ground when, passing wholly by the political insinuation against himself, he roundly charged Hobbes with having written Leviathan in support of Oliver’s title, and deserted his royal master in distress. Hobbes seems to have been fairly bewildered by the rush and whirl of sarcasm .with which Wallis drove him anew from every mathematical position he had ever taken up, and did not venture forth into the field of scientific controversy again for some years, when he had once followed up the physical dialogue of 1661 by seven shorter ones, with the inevitable appendix, entitled Problemata Physica, una cum Magnitudine Circuli (L. W., iv. pp. 297-384), in 1662.^[19. The Problemata Physica was at the same time put into English (with some changes and omission of part of the mathematical appendix), and presented to the king, to whom the work was dedicated in a remarkable letter apologizing for Leviathan. In its English form, as Seven Philosophical Problems and Two Propositions of Geometry (E. IF., vii. pp. 1-68), the work was first published in 1682, after Hobbes’s death. ] But all the more eagerly did he take advantage of Wallis’s loose calumny to strike where he felt himself safe. His answer to the personal charges tbok the form of a letter about him-

rnatical chapters, in general (not exact) keeping with the English edition of 1656. The Vindex episode, referred to in the Six Lessons, becomes intelligible only by going beyond Molesworth to the original Latin edition of 1655.
[9:12:38]

self in the third person addressed to Wallis in 1662, under the title of Considerations upon the Reputation, Loyalty, Manners, and Religion of Thomas Hobbes (E. W., iv. pp. 409-440). In this piece which is of great biographical value, he told his own and Wallis’s “little stories during the time of the late rebellion” with such effect that Wallis, like a wise man, attempted no further reply. Thus ended the second bout.

After a time Hobbes took heart again and began a third period of controversial activity, which did riot end, on his side, till his ninetieth year. Little need be added to the simple catalogue of the untiring old man’s labours in this last stage of his life. The first piece, published in 1666, De Principiis et Ratiocinatione Geometrarum (L. W., iv. pp. 385-484), was designed, as the sub-title declared, to lower the pride of geometrical professors by showing that there was no less uncertainty and error in their works than in those of physical or ethical writers. Wallis replied shortly in the Philosophical Transactions (August, 1666). Three years later he brought his three great achievements together in compendious form, Q,uadratu,ra Circuli, Cuba>io Sphoeroe, Duplicatio Cubi, and as soon as they were once more refuted by Wallis, reprinted them with an answer to the objections, in compliment to the grand-duke of Tuscany, who paid him attentions on a visit to England in 1669 (2λ W., iv. pp. 485-522). Wallis, who had promised to leave him alone henceforward, refuted him again before the year was out. In 1671 he worked up his propositions over again in Rosetum Geometricum (L.W., V. pp. 1-50), as a fragrant offering to the geometrical reader, appending a criticism (Censura brevis, pp. 50-88) on the first part of Wallis’s treatise De Motu, published in 1669; also he sent Three Papers to the Royal Society on selected points treated very briefly, and when Wallis, still not weary of confuting, shortly replied, published them separately with triumphant Considerations on Dr Wallis's Ansiver to them (E. W., vii. pp. 429-448). Next year, 1672, having now, as he believed, established himself with the Royal Society, he proceeded to complete the discomfiture of Wallis by a public address to the Society on all the points at issue between them from the beginning, Lux Mathematica excussa collisionibus Johannis Wallisii et Thomoe Hobbesii (L. W., v. pp. 89-150), the light, as the author R. R. (Roseti Repertor) added, being here “increased by many very brilliant rays.” Wallis replied in the Transactions, and then finally held his hand. Hobbes’s energy was not yet exhausted. In 1674, at the age of eighty-six, he published his Principia et Problemata aliquot Geometrica, ante desperata nunc breviter explicata et demonstrata (L. W., v. pp. 150-214), containing in the chapters dealing with questions of principle not a few striking observations, which ought not to be overlooked in the study of his philosophy. His last piece of all, Decameron Physiologicum (E. W., vii. pp. 69-180), in 1678, was a new set of dialogues on physical questions, most of which he had treated in a similar fashion before; but now, in dealing with gravitation, he was able to fire a parting shot at Wallis; and one more demonstration of the equality of a straight line to the arc of a circle, thrown in at the end, appropriately closed the strangest warfare in which perverse thinker ever engaged.^[20. Wallis’s pieces were excluded from the collected edition of his works (1693-97), and have become extremely rare. ]

We must now turn back to trace the fortunes of Hobbes and his other doings in the last twenty years of his life. All these controversial writings on mathematics and physics represent but one half of his activity after the age of seventy; though, as regards the other half, it is not possible, for a reason that will be seen, to say as definitely in what order the works belonging to the period were produced. From the time of the Restoration he acquired a new prominence in the public eye. No year had passed since the appearance of Leviathan without some indignant protest against the influence which its trenchant doctrine was calculated to produce upon minds longing above everything for civil repose; but it was not until the old political order was set up again that “Hobbism” became a fashionable creed, which it was the duty of every lover of true morality and religion to denounce. Friends and foes alike were impressed by the king’s behaviour to the aged philosopher. Two or three days after Charles’s arrival in London, Hobbes, who had come up to town from spending the previous winter in Derbyshire, drew in the street the notice of his former pupil, and was at once received into favour. The young king, if he had ever himself resented the apparent disloyalty of the “Conclusion” of Leviathan, had not retained the feeling long, and could well enough appreciate the principles of the great book when the application of them happened, as now, to be turned in his own favour. He had, besides, from of old a relish for Hobbes’s lively wit, and did not like the old man the less because his presence at court scandalized the bishops or the prim virtue of Chancellor Hyde. He even went the length of bestowing on Hobbes (but not always paying) a yearly pension of £100, and had his portrait hung up in the royal closet. These marks of favour, naturally, did not lessen Hobbes’s self-esteem, and perhaps they explain, in his later writings, a certain slavishness of feeling toward the regal authority, which is wholly absent from his rational demonstration of absolutism in the earlier works. At all events Hobbes remained very well satisfied with the rule of a king who had the sense to appreciate the author of Leviathan, and to protect him, when after a time protection in a very real sense became necessary. His eagerness to defend himself against Wallis’s imputation of disloyalty, and his apologetic dedication of the Problemata Physica to the king, are evidence of the hostility with which he was being pressed as early as 1662; but it was not till 1666 that he felt himself seriously in danger. In that year the Great Fire of London, following in ominous succession on theGreat Plague of the year before, roused the superstitious fears and intolerant passions of the people, and the House of Commons embodied the general feeling in a bill against atheism and profaneness. On the 17th October it was ordered that the committee to which the bill was referred “should be empowered to receive information touching such books as tend to atheism, blasphemy, and profaneness, or against the essence and attributes of God, and in particular the book published in the name of one White,^[21. The De Medio Aηirnαrurn Statu of Thomas White, a heterodox Catholic priest, who contested the natural immortality of the soul. White (who died 1676) and Hobbes were friends. ] and the book of Mr Hobbes called the Leviathan, and to report the matter with their opinion to the House.” What steps were taken before the 31st of January following, when the bill was read a third time and passed, does not appear; but Hobbes, then verging upon eighty, was greatly terrified at the prospect of being treated as a heretic, and proceeded to burn such of his papers as he thought might compromise him. At the same time he set himself, with a very characteristic determination, to inquire into the actual state of the law of heresy. The results of his investigation were first announced in three short Dialogues added (in place of the old “Review and Conclusion,” for which the day had passed) as an Appendix to his Latin translation of Leviathan (L. W., iii.), included with the general collection of his works published at Amsterdam in 1668. In this appendix, as also in the posthumous tract, published in 1680, An Historical Narration concerning Heresy and the Punishment thereof (E. W., iv. pp. 385-408), he aimed at showing that, since the High Court of Commission had been put down, there remained in England no court of heresy at all to which he was amenable, and that even when it stood nothing was to be declared heresy but what was at variance with the Nicene Creed, as he maintained the doctrine of Leviathan was not.

The only consequence that - came of the parliamentary scare was that Hobbes could never afterwards get permission to print anything on subjects relating to human conduct. The collected edition of his Latin works (in two quarto volumes) appeared at Amsterdam in 1668, because he could not obtain the censor’s licence for its publication at London, Oxford, or Cambridge. Other writings which he had finished, or on which he must have been engaged about this time, were not made public till after his death —the king apparently having made it the price of his protection that no fresh provocation should be offered to the [9:12:39] popular sentiment. The most importantof the works composed towards 1670, and thus kept back, is the extremely spirited dialogue to which he gave the title Behemoth: the History of the Causes of the Civil Wars of England and. of the Counsels and Artifices by which they were carried on from the. year 1640 to the year 1660.^[22. E. IF., vi. pp. 161-418. Though Behemoth was kept back at the king’s express desire it saw the light, without Hobbes’s leave, in 1679, before his death. ] To the same period probably belongs the unfinished Dialogue between a Philosopher and a Student of the Common La ws of England (E. W., vi. pp. 1-160), a trenchant criticism of the constitutional theory of English government as upheld by Coke. Aubrey takes credit for having tried to induce Hobbes to write upon the subject in 1664 by presenting him with a copy of Bacon’s Elements of the Laινs of England, and though the attempt was then unsuccessful, Hobbes later on took to studying the statute-book, with Coke upon Littleton. One other posthumous production (besides the tract on Heresy before mentioned) may also be referred to this, if not, as Aubrey suggests, an earlier time—the two thousand and odd elegiac verses into which he amused himself by throwing his view of ecclesiastical encroachment on the civil power; the quaint verses, disposed in his now favourite dialogue-form, were first published, nine years after his death, under the title Historia Ecclesiastica (L. W., v. pp. 311-408), with a preface by Thomas Rymer.

For some time Hobbes was not even allowed to utter a word of protest, whatever might be the occasion that his enemies took to triumph over him. In 1669 he had silently to bear the spectacle of an unworthy follower— Daniel Scargil by name, a fellow of Corpus Christi at Cambridge—made to act an edifying part in a public recantation of his principles, after having brought them into discredit by offensively supporting them in the public schools. A few years later, in 1674, he had another experience of academic disfavour when Dr John Fell, the dean of Christ Church, who bore the charges of the Latin translation of Anthony Wood’s History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford (1670), struck out all the complimentary epithets in the account of his life, and substituted very different ones; but this time the king did suffer him to defend himself by publishing a dignified letter (Vit. Auct., pp. xlviii. -1.), to which Fell replied by adding to the translation when it appeared a note full of the grossest insults. And, amid all his troubles, Hobbes was not without his consolations. No Englishman of that day stood in the same repute abroad, and foreigners, noble or learned, who came to England, never forgot to pay their respects to the old man, whose vigour and freshness of intellect no progress of the years seemed able to quench.

His pastimes in the latest years were as singular as his labours. The autobiography in Latin verse, with its playful humour, occasional pathos, and sublime self-complacency, was thrown off at the age of eighty-four. At eighty-five, in the year 1673, he sent forth a translation of four books of the Odyssey (ix-xii.) in rugged but not seldom happily turned English rhymes; and, when he found this Voyage of Ulysses eagerly received, he had ready by 1675 a complete translation of both Hiad and Odysse ↑ j (E. W., x.), prefaced by a lively dissertation “Concerning the virtues of an heroic poem,” showing his unabated interest in questions of literary style. In that year (1675) he ceased coming to London, and thenceforth passed his time at his patron’s seats in Derbyshire, always occupied to the last with some intellectual work in the early morning and in the afternoon hours, which it had long been his habit to devote to thinking and to writing. With such tenacity did he cling to his pursuits (always systematically keeping up exercise for the sake of health) that even as late as August

1679 he was promising his publisher “somewhat to print in English.” The end came very soon afterwards. A suppression of urine in October, in spite of which he insisted upon being conveyed with the family from Chatsworth to Hardwick Hall towards the end of November, was followed by a paralytic stroke, under which he sank on the 4th of December, in his ninety-second year. He lies buried in the neighbouring parish church of Hault Hucknall.

In the foregoing sketch the aim has been to give a definite idea of the circumstances in which Hobbes, after slowly developing in the first forty years of his life, displayed a mental activity of such extraordinary variety in his last fifty years. The task of expounding and criticizing either his better-known or his less-known doctrines will not be attempted in this place; but a few remarks may be added as to his position in the general movement of English philosophy. As already suggested, it cannot be allowed that he falls into any regular succession from Bacon; neither can it be said that he handed on the torch to Locke. He was the one English thinker of the first rank in the long period of two generations separating Locke from Bacon, but, save in the chronological sense, there is no true relation of succession among the three. It would be difficult even to prove any ground of affinity among them beyond a disposition to take sense as a prime factor in the account of subjective experience: their common interest in physical science was shared equally by rationalist thinkers of the Cartesian school, and was indeed begotten of the time. Backwards, Hobbes’s relations are rather with Galileo and the other inquirers who, from the beginning of the 17th century, occupied themselves with the physical world in the manner that has come later to be distinguished by the name of science in opposition to philosophy. But it happened that, even more than in external nature, Hobbes was interested in the phenomena of social life, presenting themselves so impressively in an age of political revolution. So it came to pass that, while he was unable, by reason of imperfect training and too tardy development, with all his pains, to make any contribution to physical science or to mathematics as instrumental in physical research, he attempted a task which no other adherent of the new “mechanical philosophy” conceived— nothing less than such a universal construction of human knowledge as would bring Society and Man (at once the matter and maker of Society) within the same principles of scientific explanation as were found applicable to the world of Nature. The construction was, of course, utterly premature, even supposing it were inherently possible; but it is Hobbes’s distinction, in his century, to have conceived it, and he is thereby lifted from among the scientific workers with whom he associated to the .rank of those philosophical thinkers who have sought to order the whole domain of human knowledge. Such as it was, the effects of his philosophical endeavour may be traced on a variety of lines. Upon every subject that came within the sweep of his system, except mathematics and physics, his thoughts have been productive of thought. When the first storm of opposition from smaller men, roused as much by his paradoxical expressions as by his doctrines, had begun to die down, thinkers of real weight, beginning with Cumberland and Cudworth, were moved by his analysis of the moral nature of man to probe anew the question of the natural springs and the rational grounds of human action; and thus it may be said that Hobbes gave the first impulse to the whole of that movement of ethical speculation that, in modem times, has been carried on with such remarkable continuity in England. In politics, the revulsion from his particular conclusions did not prevent the more clearsighted of his opponents from recognizing the force of his supreme demonstration of the practical irresponsibility of [9:12:40] the sovereign power, wherever seated, in the state; and, when in a later age the foundations of a positive theory of legislation were laid in England, it was extreme liberals of the school of Bentham—James Mill, Grote, Moles worth— that brought again into general notice the writings of the great publicist of the 17th century, who, however he might, by the force of temperament, himself prefer the rule of one, based his whole political system upon a rational regard to the common weal. Finally, the psychology of Hobbes, though too undeveloped to guide the thoughts or even perhaps arrest the attention of Locke, when essaying the scientific analysis of knowledge, came in course of time (chiefly through James Mill) to be connected with the theory of associationism developed from within the school of Locke, in different ways, by Hartley and Hume; nor is it surprising that the later associationists, finding their principle more distinctly formulated in the earlier thinker, should sometimes have been betrayed into affiliating themselves to Hobbes rather than to Locke.

Sufficient information is given in the Vi tee Hobbianae Auctarium (L. fV., i. pp. lxv. ff.) concerning the frequent early editions of Hobbes’s separate works, and also concerning the works of those who wrote against him, to the end of the 17th century. In the 18th century, after Clarke’s Boyle Lectures of 1704-5, the opposition was less express. In 1750 The Moral and Political ]Vorks were collected, with life, &c., by Dr Campbell, in a folio edition, including in order, Human Nature, De Corpore Politico, Leviathan, √1 nswer to BramhalVs Catching of the Leviathan, Narration concerning Heresy, Of Liberty and Necessity, Behemoth, Dialogue of the Common Laws, the Introduction to the Thucydides, Letter to Davc-nant and two others, the Preface to the Homer, De Mirabilibus Pecci (with English translation), Considerations on the Reputation, Ac., of T. H. In 1812 the Human Nature and the Liberty and Necessity (with supplementary extracts from the Questions of 1656) were reprinted in a small edition of 250 copies, with a meritorious memoir (based on Campbell) and dedication to Horne Tooke, by Philip Mallet. Molesworth’s edition (1839-45), dedicated to Grote, has been referred to in a former note. Of translations may be mentioned Les Élémens philosophiques du Citoyen (1649) and Le Corps politique (1652), both by Sorbière, conjoined with Le Traité de la Nature humaine, by D’Holbach, in 1787, under the general title Les Oeuvres philosophiques et politiques de Thomas Hobbes·, a translation of the first section, “Computatio sive Logica,” of the De Corpore, included by Destutt de Tracy with his Élémens d'idéologie (1804); a translation of Leviathan into Dutch in 1678, and another (anonymous) into German— Des Engländers Thomas Hobbes Leviathan- oder der kirchliche und bürgerliche Staat (Halle, 1794, 2 vols.); a translation of the De Give by J. H. v. Kirchmann— T. Hobbes: Abhandlung über den Bürger, Ac. (Leipsic, 1873). No comprehensive monograph on Hobbes’s whole philosophical performance has yet been produced. Molesworth had begun to make preparations for writing one when his energies were diverted into practical politics. (G. C. R. )
