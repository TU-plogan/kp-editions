HOLYHEAD (Welsh, Caer-Gybi, the fort of Gybi), a market-town and parliamentary borough of Anglesey, North Wales, is situated on a small island on the western extremity of the county and at the terminus of the Chester and Holyhead Railway, 24 miles from Bangor. It is connected with the mainland by an embankment three quarters of a mile long, over which pass both the railway and the coach road. Underneath the bridge in the centre the tide rushes with great velocity. The town, formerly a small fishing village, has since the reign of William III. acquired importance as the station of the mail packets for Dublin, and it now possesses a magnificent harbour of refuge begun in 1847, and formally opened in September 1873. The original plan included the erection of a north breakwater 5360 feet in length from the coast-line, and also of an east breakwater 2000 feet in length, but the scheme of the east breakwater, of which the chief object was to cover the Platter’s and Skinner’s Rocks, was subsequently abandoned, and their positions were marked instead by buoys. On account of the number of vessels which began to take advantage of the shelter that was being provided for them it was also resolved to lengthen the northern breakwater in a north-easterly direction by 2000 feet, and subsequently by 500 feet more, making its total length 7860 feet. By these additions a sheltered roadstead of 400 acres in extent was obtained, besides the enclosed area of 267 acres. The breakwater consists of a rubble mound, upon which is erected [9:12:105] a solid central wall of massive masonry rising to a height of 38 feet 9 inches above low water. On the wall there is a promenade sheltered on the sea side by a parapet. The breakwater is terminated by a head 150 feet long and 50 feet wide, on which is erected a lighthouse, The whole cost of the works was £1,479,538. In 1873 works were commenced by the railway company for extending the old harbour and increasing the length of the quay to 4000 feet. They were opened by the prince of Wales in June 1880. The cost has been nearly half a million sterling. Upon the pier of the old harbour there is an arch of Mona marble, commemorative of the visit of George IV. in 1821 on his way to Ireland. The church, an old embattled building, is said to occupy the site of an ancient monastery founded by St Gybi about 610; and in the south porch there is a rude figure of the patron saint under a canopy. The churchyard is surrounded by a wall 6 feet thick, supposed by some to be of Roman construction.

The town possesses assembly-rooms and baths. On the rock south of the harbour is an obelisk erected in memory of Captain Skinner, commander of the steam packet, who in 1833 lost his life by being washed overboard. About 2 miles from the town, Pen-Caer-Gybi, or the hill of Holyhead, rises perpendicularly from the sea to the height of 700 feet, affording a fine view of the town and harbour, and the irregularities of the rock-bound coast. On the sides of the hill there are traces of an extensive British fortification, and on the summit are remains of a circular building, which in all probability was a Roman watch-tower. The inhabitants are chiefly engaged in the coasting trade and in shipbuilding. Holyhead unites with Beaumaris in returning a member to parliament. The population of the parliamentary borough in 1871 was 8131.
