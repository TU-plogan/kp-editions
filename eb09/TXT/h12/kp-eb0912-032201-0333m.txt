HOWE, John (1630-1706), one of the greatest of the later Puritan divines, was born May 17, 1630, at Loughborough, Leicestershire, of which parish his father was minister. When hardly five years old he was removed to Ireland by his father, who, unable to support the ecclesiastical policy of Archbishop Laud, had been ejected from his living. On the outbreak of the Irish rebellion in 1641, the exiles returned to England; and, fixing his abode in Lancashire, the elder Howe conducted in person the studies of his son, who in his seventeenth year (May 19, 1647) entered Christ’s College, Cambridge, as a sizar, and in the following year took his degree of B.A. During his residence in this university he made the acquaintance of Cudworth, More, and Smith, from intercourse with whom, doubtless, as Calamy suggests, as well as from direct acquaintance with the Dialogues themselves, his mind received that “Platonic tinge” which is so perceptible in his writings. Immediately after graduation at Cambridge, he removed to Oxford, where he took the same degree in the following year, and, after becoming a fellow of Magdalen College, proceeded M A. in 1652. On leaving Oxford in that year he returned to his father’s retreat in Lancashire, and received ordination at Win wick from the hands of Mr Herle, the minister of the parish, who was assisted by the ministers of the neighbouring chapelries. Sometime afterwards “an unexpected conduct of divine providence” bore him to Great Torrington in Devonshire, where he spent some years as pastor. It was there that he preached those discourses v·diich at a later period took shape in his treatises on The Blessedness of the Righteous and on Delighting in God. There also it was that he married the daughter of “his inner friend” Mr George Hughes. In the beginning of 1657 a journey to London accidentally brought Howe under the notice of Cromw'ell, who, struck by his appearance and preaching, made him his domestic chaplain. In this prominent position, -which he had accepted with very great reluctance, his conduct as the almoner and confidential adviser of the Protector was such as to win the praises of even the bitterest enemies of his party. Without overlooking the due claims of the Puritans, he omitted no opportunity of helping pious and learned men of other denominations, Ward (afterwards bishop of Exeter) and Thomas Fuller having been among the number of those who profited by How⅛ , s kindness, and who were not ashamed subsequently to express their gratitude for it. On the deposition of Richard Cromwell, Howe returned to Great Torrington, where, like all who had played a conspicuous part under the Commonwealth, he soon after the Restoration found himself an object of suspicion and hatred; in 1662 the passing of the Act of Uniformity drove him from his parish. For several years he now led a wandering and uncertain life, preaching in secret as occasion offered to handfuls of trusted hearers. More than once his liberty was in imminent peril; and it is alleged by Calamy, though on doubtful grounds, that for two months in 1665 he was imprisoned in the Isle of St Nicholas in Plymouth Sound. Impelled by the demands of pressing want, he in 1668 published the treatise entitled The Blessedness of the Righteous; the reputation which he had acquired by it procured for him in 1669 an invitation from Lord Massarene of Antrim Castle, Ireland, to become his domestic chaplain. At Antrim, where he was soon joined by his family, he accordingly spent six years of quiet, during which he frequently preached in public, with the approval of the bishop of the diocese, and also found time [9:12:323] to produce the most eloquent of his shorter treatises, The Vanity of Man as Mortal, and On Delighting in God ; there too he planned the largest (and also in some respect the greatest) of his works, The Living Temple. In the beginning of 1676 he accepted an invitation to become pastor of a nonconformist congregation in Silver Street, London; and in the same year he published the first part of The Living Temple, entitled Concerning God's Existence and His Conversableness with Man: Against Atheism or the Epicurean Deism. In 1677 appeared his tractate On the Reconcileable-ness of God's Prescience of the Sins of Men with the Wisdom and Sincerity of His Coιιnsels, Exhortations, and whatsoever means He uses to prevent them, which was attacked from various quarters, and had Andrew Marvel for oneof its defenders. His work On Thoughtfulness for the Morrow followed in 1681; those on Self-Dedication and Union among Protestants in 1682; and that on The Redeemer's Tears wept over Lost Souls in 1684. During the earlier years that followed his settlement in London Howe had enjoyed comparative freedom from annoyance on the ground of his nonconformity, and had been on intimate terms with many who already were or who afterwards became eminent in the Established Church, such as Stillingfieet, Tillotson, Sharp, and Kidder; but the greater severity which began to be manifested in 1681, and which continued to be shown during the following years, so interfered with his liberty that in 1685 he gladly accepted the invitation of Philip Lord Wharton to travel abroad with him. The tour extended over the greater part of a year. In 1686, matters still seeming hopeless in England, he determined to settle for a time at Utrecht, where he officiated along with Mead and others in the English chapel, and also read privately with English students at the university. Among his friends there was Burnet, the future bishop of Salisbury, by whose influence he obtained several confidential interviews with the prince of Orange. In 1687 Howe availed himself of the publication by James II. of the declaration for liberty of conscience to return to England, and in the following year he headed the procession of nonconformist ministers who went to congratulate William on his accession to the English throne. The remainder of his life, so far as recorded, was extremely uneventful. In 1693 he published three admirable discourses On the Carnality of Religious Contention, suggested by the disputes and divisions that had so abundantly occurred among the nonconformists as soon as liberty of doctrine and worship had been granted. In 1694 and 1695 he published various treatises on the subject of the Trinity, the principal being A Calm and Solemn Inquiry concerning the Possibility of a Trinity in the Godhead. The second part of The Living Temple, entitled Animadversions on Spinosa and a French Writer pyretending to confute him, with a recapitulation of the former part and an account of the destitution and restitution of God's Temple among Men, appeared in 1702. About this time he appears to have fallen into shattered health, but he was able in 1705 to give to the world a discourse On Patience in the Expectation of Future Blessedness, which proved to be his last work. He died in London on April 2, 1706.

Though excelled by Baxter as a pulpit orator, and by Owen in exegetieal ingenuity and in almost every department of theological learning, Howe compares favourably with either as a sagacious and profound thinker, while he was much more successful in combining religious earnestness and fervour of conviction with large-hearted tolerance and cultured breadth of view. His style, moreover, though not altogether free from the literary faults which may almost be called characteristic of Puritanism, has often a stately yet graceful flow which the modern reader will look for in vain in most of Howe’s theological contemporaries. The works published in his life-time, including a number of sermons and other occasional pieces besides those specified above, were collected into 2 vols. fol. m 1724, and again reprinted in 3 vols. 8vo. in 1848. A complete edition of the Whole Works, including much posthumous and additional matter, appeared with a Memoir in 8 vols, in 1822; this was reprinted in 1 vol. in 1838. The Memoirs of Howe by Calamy, originally published in 1724, have been more than once reprinted, and form the basis of The Life and Character of Howe, with an Analysis 0 f hi s Writings, by Henry Rogers (1836; new ed∙,
