HORSHAM, a parliamentary borough and market-town of Sussex, England, is pleasantly situated in the midst of a fertile country near the source of the Arun and on the MidSussex Railway, 37∣ miles south of London. It consists chiefly of two streets crossing each other at right angles, and a picturesque causeway leading to the church, adorned with rows of trees. Within recent years the town has undergone great improvements, and it now possesses well-paved streets and some handsome buildings. In the vicinity there are several fine mansions. Works were erected in 1865 for supplying the town with water from a well in the neighbourhood. The principal buildings are the parish church, often repaired, and in 1865 entensively restored, a very ancient structure in the Early English style, with the remains of Norman work, having a lofty tower surmounted by a spire, and containing several fine monuments and tombs, and two brasses; the grammar school, founded in 1540 and rebuilt in 1840, recommended to be used as a middle class school by the Endowed Schools Commission; the corn exchange, erected in 1766 in the Italian style, with a room for assemblies and public meetings; the Roman Catholic chapel of St John in the Early English style, erected in 1866 at the cost of the duchess of Norfolk. A school board was formed in 1873, which, besides having the management of most of the schools previously existing, has erected new buildings in the east end of the town, at a cost of above £4000. Thera are a number of small charities, and almshouses were founded in 1842 by the Rev. Jarvis Kenrick. The town possesses a tannery, a foundry, a carriage factory, and several flour-mills. The area of the parish and parliamentary borough is 10,741 acres, and the population in 1871 was 7831.

There is a tradition which derives the name of Horsham from Horsa the brother of Hengist, who is said to have been slain in the vicinity; others derive it from korsham, the horses’ meadow; but the most probable derivation is Hurst-Ham or the Ham (village) in the Hurst (forest). The town is a borough by prescription, and returned two members to parliament from the 23d year of the reign of Edward I. to the 2d of William IV., when it was deprived of one of its members. It has never been incorporated, and it is now governed by a local board.
