HOOFT, Pieter Cornelissen (1581-1647), Dutch poet and historian, was born at Amsterdam on the 16th of March 1581, His father was one of the leading citizens of Holland, both in politics and in the patronage of letters, and for some time burgomaster of Amsterdam. As early as 1598 the young man was made a member of the chamber of rhetoric of the Eglantine, and produced before that body his tragedy of Achilles and Polyxena, not printed until 1614. In June 1598 he left Holland and proceeded to Paris, where on the 10th of April 1599 he saw the body of Gabrielle d’Estrees lying in state. He went a few months later to Venice, Florence, and Rome. In 1600 he proceeded to Naples, and during all this Italian sojourn he made a deep and fruitful study of the best literature of Italy. In July 1600 he sent home to the Eglantine a very fine letter in verse, which is considered to mark an epoch in the development of Dutch poetry. He returned through Germany, and after an absence of three years and a half found himself in Amsterdam again on the 8th of May 1601. He soon after brought out his second tragedy, the Ariadne, in 1602. In 1605 he completed his beautiful pastoral drama Granula, not published until 1615. He studied law at Leyden from 1606 to 1609, and in June of the latter year received from the prince of Orange the appointment of steward of Minden, bailiff of Gooiland, and lord of Weesp, a joint office of great emolument. He occupied himself with repairing and adorning the decayed castle of Minden, which was his residence during the remainder of his life. In August 1610 he married the famous botanist, Christina van Erp. In 1612 Hooft produced, and in 1613 printed, his national tragedy of Geeraerdt van Velsen, a story of the reign of Count Floris V. In 1614 was performed at Coster’s academy Hooft’s comedy of Ware-ηar, an adaptation of the Aulularia of Plautus, first printed in 1617. In 1616 he wrote another tragedy, Baeto, or the Origin of the Dutch, not printed until 1626. It was in 1618 that he abandoned poetry for history, and in 1626 he published the first of his great prose works, the [9:12:147] History of Henry the Great (Henry IV. of France). His next production was his Miseries of the Princes of the House of Medici, printed in 1638. In 1642 he published the masterpiece of his life, his Dutch History, a magnificent performance, to the perfecting of which he had given fifteen years of labour. Hooft died on a visit to Prince Frederick Henry at the Hague on the 21st of May 1647, and was buried in the New Church at Amsterdam.

Hooft is one of the most brilliant figures that adorn Dutch literature at its best period. He was the first writer to introduce a modern and European tone into belles lettres, and the first to refresh the sources of native thought from the springs of antique and Renaissance poetry. His lyrics and his pastoral of Granida are strongly marked by the influence of Tasso and Sannazaro; his later tragedies belong more exactly to the familiar tone of his native country. But high as Hooft stands among the Dutch poets, he stands higher, he holds perhaps the highest place, among writers of Dutch prose. His historical style has won the warmest eulogy from so temperate a critic as Motley, and his letters are the most charming ever published in the Dutch language. After Vondel, he may on the whole be considered the most considerable author that Holland has produced.

Hooft ’ s poetical and dramatic works were collected in two volumes, 1871, 1875, by P. Leendertz. Many editions exist of his prose works.
