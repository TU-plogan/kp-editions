HONORIUS III., pope from 1216 to 1227, was the successor of Innocent III., whose uncompromising policy in the struggle between the papacy and the empire he had not firmness and vigour to continue. He consented to crown Frederick II. as Holy Roman emperor in 1220, although the engagements made with his predecessor had not been fulfilled; the promises which he himself had exacted he was somewhat slow to urge, and it was left to his successor Gregory IX. to insist upon their accomplishment. He gave papal sanction to the Dominican order in 1216, and to the Franciscan in 1223; and during his pontificate also many of the tertiary orders first came into existence.
