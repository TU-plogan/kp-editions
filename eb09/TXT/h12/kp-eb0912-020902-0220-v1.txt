HORSLEY, William (1774-1858), an English musician of considerable reputation, was born November 15, 1774, and became in 1790 the pupil of Theodore Smith, an indifferent musician of the time, who, however, taught him sufficient to obtain the position of organist at Ely Chapel, Holborn. This post he resigned in 1798, to become organist at the Asylum for Female Orphans, as assistant to Dr Callcott, with whom he had long been on terms of personal and artistic intimacy, and whose eldest daughter he married. In 1802 he became his friend’s successor upon the latter’s resignation. Besides holding this appointment he became in 1812 organist of Belgrave Chapel, Halkin Street, and in 1837 of the Charter House. He died June 12, 1858. Horsley’s compositions are numerous, and include amongst other instrumental pieces three symphonies for full orchestra. Infinitely more important are his glees, of which he published five books, besides contributing many detached glees and part songs to various collections. Mr Barrett, in his lecture on “English glee and madrigal writers,” calls Horsley “one of the princes amongst glee writers,” and attributes to him “a fine and powerful dramatic aim and an elegant taste.” Horsley’s compositions are moreover distinguished by a remarkable purity of style, which sometimes verges on pedantry. His glees, “By Celia’s arbour,” “O nightingale,” “Now the storm begins to lower,” and others, are amongst the finest specimens of this peculiarly English class of compositions. Horsley’s son (Charles Edward), born in 1822, enjoyed a certain reputation as a musician. He studied in Germany under Hauptmann and Mendelssohn, and on his return to England composed several oratorios and other pieces, none of which had permanent success. In 1868 he emigrated to Australia. He died March 2, 1876, at New York.
