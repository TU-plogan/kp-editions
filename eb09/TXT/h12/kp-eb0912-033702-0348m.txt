HUGH of St Victor, Hugo a S. Victore, sometimes also known as Hugh of Paris (c. 1097-1141), was born, probably in the neighbourhood of Ypres, about 1097, and is known to have received his early education in the cloister of Hamersleben near Halberstadt; in 1115 he removed for the further advancement of his studies to the abbey of St Victor, which had recently been founded by William of Champeaux, the preceptor of Abelard, in the neighbourhood of Paris. There the remainder of his life was spent in teaching or in studious retirement. He died in 1141.

The works of Hugh of St Victor, who was the intimate friend of St Bernard, share all the learning, acuteness, and mysticism of the theological school which then sought to neutralize the opinions and the influence of Abelard. Of chief importance are— Institutiones Monasticce, including the treatises De arca morali, De arca mystica, and De vanitate mundi ; De Sacramentis Fidei, on the mysteries of the faith, and thus a complete exposition of Catholic theology; and De Eruditione Didascalica, in six books, which earned for its compiler the title of magister or didascalus. It forms a sort of encyclopaedia of the sciences as then understood, viewed of course merely in their subordination to theology. In his treatment of Biblical introduction, the sharpness with which he separates the apocryphal from the canonical books has been noticed; but in doing so it is important also to recollect that he seems to place on a par with the New Testament the canons, the decretals, and the writings of the fathers. An Augustinian in spirit and in language, so as to deserve the titles Alter Augustinus and Lingua Augustini, by which he is frequently designated, Hugo was still more eminently the disciple of Anselm and Abelard; he, however, had a strongly marked individuality of his own, which appears in his somewhat fully elaborated theory of knowing and being. All the knowable he assigns to one or other of three spheres, that of intelligence, that of science, and that of logic. That of intelligence embraces both theory and practice. Under theory fall to be classed theology, mathematics (arithmetic, music, geometry, astronomy), and physics; practice is equivalent to ethics. Science has to do with the practical arts and industries, while logic embraces grammar, rhetoric, and dialectic. In correspondence to the trichotomous division of man, as made up of body, soul, and spirit, he speaks of a threefold eye, that of the body, that of reason, and that of contemplation. The last of these, by which God is discerned, has been totally destroyed by sin; the second has been much impaired. Faith now takes the place of contemplation; but by oratio and operatio it can attain to real convictions and genuine love. The doctrine of the Trinity he illustrates by the analogy of the human personality as spirit, wisdom, and love. The collected works have been printed at Paris in 1528, at Venice in 1588, at Mainz and Cologne in 1617, and at Rouen in 1648. They occupy three volumes (175-177) in Migne’s Patrologice Cursus Completus. See Hist. Litt, de la France, vol. xii.; Liebner, H. v. S. Victor, (1832); Görres, Die christliche Mystik ; and other works bearing on this general subject.
