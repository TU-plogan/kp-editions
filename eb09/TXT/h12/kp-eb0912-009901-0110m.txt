HOLLAND, Philemon (1551-1636), usually styled, in the words of Thomas Fuller, “the translator-general of his age,” was born in 1551 at Chelmsford, in Essex, the son of a clergyman, John Holland, who had been obliged to take refuge abroad during the Marian persecution. Having become a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, and passed Μ. A. at Oxford in 1587, he further took the degree of M.D. at Cambridge in 1591. In 1612 he was sworn freeman of the city of Coventry, andin 1617, dressed in a suit which cost £11, Is. 11d., he had the honour of reading, as the recorder’s deputy, an oration to King James I. In 1628 he was appointed head master of the free school of Coventry, but, owing probably to advancing old age, he held office only for eleven months. His latter days were oppressed by poverty, partly relieved by the generosity of the common council of Coventry, which in 1632 assigned him £3, 6s. 8d. for three years, “if he should live so long.” He died February 9, 1636, survived by only one of his seven sons. The fame of Philemon Holland is due solely to his activity as a translator; Livy, Pliny’s Natural History, Plutarch’s Morals, Suetonius, Ammianus Marcellinus, and Xenophon’s Cyropoedia successively employed him; and he also published an English version of Camden’s Britannia. Pope’s allusion to his voluminousness is well known—

“De Lyra there his dreadful front extends, And here the groaning shelves Philemon bends.”

Henry Holland, his surviving son, became a London bookseller, and is known to bibliographers for his Baziliω-logia∙, a Books of Kings, beeing the true and liuely Effigies of all our English Kings from the Conquest (London, 1618), and his Her<r>ologia Anglica, hoc est clariss. et doctiss. aliquot Anglorum viuae Effigies, Vitoe et Elogia (1620).
