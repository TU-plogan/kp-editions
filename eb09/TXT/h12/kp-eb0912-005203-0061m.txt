HOHENZOLLERN, an old German princely house, from which the present dynasty of Prussia is descended, takes its name from the old castle of Zollern, or Hohenzollern, on the mountain of Zollern, about 1 j miles south from Hechingen. There is a vague tradition connecting the house with the Colonna family of Rome, or the Colalto family of Lombardy, and a more definite one which mentions a Swabian count, Thassilo of Burchardinger, as having built the castle of Zollern about the beginning of the 9th century. The first counts of Zollern of whom there is historical mention are Burchard and Wezel, apparently brothers, who in 1061 fell in one of the party feuds during the minority of the emperor Henry IV. Count Frederick III. of Zolre, who died in 1200, one of the trusted councillors of the emperors Frederick I. and Henry VI., became count of Nuremberg in 1191, through having married the heiress of Count Conrad II. of Nuremberg. His sons, Conrad III. and Frederick IV., succeeded to the joint possession of his titles and estates, and founded respectively the Frankish and the Swabian lines. The Frankish house steadily and uninterruptedly increased its possessions and its influence; in 1363 it was raised to princely rank in the person of Frederick V.; in 1415 it obtained through Frederick VI. the electorate of Brandenburg from the emperor Sigismund; and in 1701 its head, the elector Frederick III., became the first king of Prussia. The influence of the Swabian line was greatly weakened by partitions, but in the beginning of the 16th century it rose tosome eminence through Count Eitel Frederick II., privy councillor of the emperor Maximilian I., who received from the emperor the district of Hargerloch in exchange for Rhäzüns, in the Grisons, which had come into his family by marriage. His grandson, Charles I., received in 1529 from the emperor Charles V. the countships of Sigmaringen and Vöhringen. Eitel Frederick III. and Charles II. divided their states, the former taking Hohen-zυllern with the title Hohenzollern-Hechingen, the latter Sigmaringen and Vöhringen with the title Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Count John George of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, son of Eitel Frederick HL, was raised to princely rank by the emperor Ferdinand II. in 1623, and John of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen received the same honour in 1638. In 1695 the two Swabian branches entered conjointly into an agreement with the Brandenburg line that, in case of the extinction of the male line of either of the Swabian branches, the states should be inherited by the other branch, and that if both branches became extinct the states should be inherited by the Brandenburg line. In consequence of the political troubles of 1848, Prince Frederick William of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, and Charles Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen resigned their principalities, which consequently fell to the crown of Prussia, by whom they were taken possession of, March 12, 1850. By royal decree of 20th May of the same year the title of highness was conferred on the two princes, with the prerogatives of younger sons of the royal house. The proposal to raise Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen to the throne of Spain in 1870 was the immediate occasion of the war between France and Germany. In 1852 the lands of Hohenzollern were formed into an administrative division of Prussia. It is composed of a long narrow strip of land bounded on the N.E. and W. by Wurtemberg and on the W. and S. by Baden, with an area of 440 square miles, and a population in 1875 of 66,614.
