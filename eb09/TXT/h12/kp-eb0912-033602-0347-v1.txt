HUG, Johann Leonhard (1765-1846), Roman Catholic theologian and Biblical critic, was born at Constance, where his father was a locksmith, on June 1, 1765. After passing through the gymnasium of his native town, he proceeded in 1783 to the university of Freiburg, where he became a pupil in the seminary for the training of priests, and very early distinguished himself in the departments of classical and Oriental philology as well as of Biblical exegesis and criticism. In 1787 he became superintendent of studies in the seminary, and he continued to hold this appointment until the breaking up of the establishment in 1790. In the following year he was called to the Freiburg chair of Oriental languages and Old Testament exegesis; to the duties of this post were added in 1793 those of the professorship of New Testament exegesis. Steadily declining calls to Breslau, Tübingen, and (repeatedly) to Bonn, Hug continued to labour at his post in Freiburg for upwards of thirty years, varying the monotony of his work only by an occasional literary tour to Munich, Paris, or Italy. In 1827 he resigned some of his professorial work, but continued in active duty until in the autumn of 1845 he was seized with a painful illness, which proved fatal on March 11 of the following year.

Hug’s earliest publication was the first instalment or “heft” of his Einleitung ; in it he argued with much acuteness against Eichhorn in favour of the “borrowing hypothesis” of the origin of the synoptical gospels, maintaining the priority of Matthew, the present Greek text having been the original. His subsequent works were dissertations on the origin of alphabetical writing (Die Erfindung der Buchstabenschrift, 1801), on the antiquity of the Codex Vaticanus (1810), and on ancient mythology (Ueber den Mythos der alten Völker, 1812); a new interpretation of the Song of Solomon (Das hohe Lied in einer noch unversuchten Deutung, 1813), to the effect that the lover represents King Hezekiah, while by his beloved is intended the remnant left in Israel after the deportation of the ten tribes; and treatises on the indissoluble character of the matrimonial bond (De Conjugii Christiani vinculo indissolubili commentatio exegetica, 1816) and on the Alexandrian version of the Pentateuch (1818). His Einleitung in die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, undoubtedly his most important work, was completed in 1808 (fourth German edition, 1847; English translations by Wait, London, 1827; and by Fosdick, New York; French partial translation by Cellerier, Geneva, 1823). It is specially valuable in the portion relating to the history of the text (which up to the middle of the 3d century he holds to have been current only in a κoι,vy tκδoσιs, of which recensions were afterwards made by Hesychius, an Egyptian bishop, by Lucian of Antioch, and by Origen) and in its discussion of the ancient versions. The author’s intelligence and acuteness are more completely hampered by doctrinal presuppositions when he comes to treat questions relating to the history of the individual books of the New Testament canon. From 1839 to his death Hug was a regular and important contributor to the Freiburger Zeitschrift für Kathol. Theologie.
