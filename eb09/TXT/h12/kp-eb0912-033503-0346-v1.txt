HUFELAND, Christoph Wilhelm (1762-1836), a distinguished physician and writer on medical subjects, was born at Langensalza, 12th August 1762. His early education was carried on at Weimar, where his father held the office of court physician to the grand duchess. In 1780 he entered the university at Jena, and in the following year proceeded to Göttingen, where in 1783 he graduated in the faculty of medicine. After assisting his father for some years at Weimar, he was called in 1793 to the chair of medicine at Jena, receiving at the same time the dignities of court physician and councillor at Weimar. In 1793 he [9:12:336] was placed at the head of the medical college and generally of state medical affairs in Berlin, with the title of privy councillor. He filled the chair of pathology and therapeutics in the university of Berlin, founded in 1809, and in 1810 became councillor of state. He died at Berlin in 1836.

Hufeland is celebrated as the most eminent practical physician of his time in Germany, and as the author of numerous works displaying extensive reading and cultivated and critical faculty. The most widely known of his many writings is the treatise entitled Makrobiotik, oder die Kunst das menschliche Leben zu verlängern, 1796. Of his practical works, all of the kind which cannot long retain their place in the literature of special science, the System of Practical. Medicine (“System der praktischen Heilkunde,” 3 vols., 1828) is the most elaborate. By medical writers Hufeland’s services in promoting and elevating the study of the art of medicine are highly extolled. His autobiography was published in 1863. Sketches of his life and labours apυeared shortly after his death by Augustin and Stourdza, 1837.
