HOPKINS, Ezekiel (1633-1690), bishop of Londonderry, and a Calvinistic divine of some repute, was born at Stanford, Devon (where his father was curate), in 1633, was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he identified himself with the Presbyterian party, and about 1660 became assistant to DrW. Spurstow of Hackney, the W.S. [UU.S.] of “Smectymnuus.” He was subsequently presented to the living of St Mary Woolnoth, London, which at the outbreak of the plague he exchanged for that of St Mary’s, Exeter. Having married a daughter of Lord Robartes, who in 1669 became lord-lieutenant of Ireland, he was soon afterwards promoted to the deanery of Raphoe, and in 1671 he was raised to the bishopric of that diocese. Translated to the see of Londonderry in 1681, he continued to discharge his episcopal functions until the period of the famous siege, when, after having vainly sought to inculcate the doctrine of passive resistance, he withdrew to London, where in 1689 he accepted the living of St Mary Aldermanbury. He died in June 1690.

His works, consisting chiefly of discourses, but including A practical Exposition of the Lord's Prayer and An Exposition of the Ten Commandments, were first published in a complete and uniform edition in 1701; they were reprinted in 4 vols, in 1809, with a Life prefixed, by Pratt, and again, in 2 vols., in 1841-44. Though marked by “strength of thought, originality of illustration, and felicity of style,” they are now but seldom read.
