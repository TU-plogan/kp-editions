HITTORFF, Jacques Ignace (1793-1867), French architect, was born at Cologne, August 20, 1793. After serving an apprenticeship to a mason in his native town, ho went in 1810 to Paris, and studied for some years at the Academy of the Fine Arts, where he was a favourite pupil of the Government architect Bélanger, who in 1814 appointed him his principal inspector. Succeeding Bélanger as Government architect in 1818, he designed many important public and private buildings in Paris and also in the south of France. After making architectural tours in Germany, England, Italy, and Sicily, he published the result of his observations in the latter country in the work Architecture antique de la Sicile (3 vols. 1826-30; new edition, 1866- 67), and also in Architecture moderne de la Sicile (1826-35). One of his important discoveries was that colour had been made use of in ancient Greek architecture, a subject which he especially discussed in Architecture polychrome chez les Crees (1830), and in Restitution du temple <T Empedocle à Selinunte (1851); and in accordance with the doctrines enunciated in these works he was in the habit of making colour an important feature in most of his architectural designs. His principal building is the church of St Vincent de Paul in the basilica style. He also designed many of the embellishments of the Place de la Concorde, the Champs-Élysées—where he constructed the Circus of the Empress, which has been the model of many similar buildings in various parts of Europe—the Bois de Boulogne, and other places. In 1833 he was elected a member of the Academy of Fine Arts. He died at Paris, March 25, 1867.
