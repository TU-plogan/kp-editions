HIT, the ancient Is (see Euphrates, vol. vii. p. 670), a town of Asiatic Turkey, vilayet of Baghdad, is situated on the west bank of the Euphrates, 70 miles W.N.W. of Baghdad. Its streets are narrow and frequently steep, rising one above another along the side of a hill, and the houses, which are flat-roofed, and one or two stories in height, are built chiefly of clay. It contains a graceful minaret and some richly decorated tomb-towers. The prosperity of the town depends upon its fountain of bitumen, which has flowed from time immemorial, and, according to Herodotus, supplied that material for the building of Babylon. The inhabitants make use of the bitumen for lime burning, and also for covering boats. From water w hich bubbles up in the centre of the spring salt is manufactured. The population is about 3000.
