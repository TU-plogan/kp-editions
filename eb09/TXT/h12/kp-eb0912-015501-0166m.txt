HOORN, a town of Holland, at the head of an arrondissement in the province of North Holland, 20 miles N.N.E. of Amsterdam and 10 miles S.W. of Enkhuizen, with which it is connected by the road called De Streek, or The Stroke. The Hoornerhop, a bay of the Zuyder Zee, forms a good outer harbour, and the inner harbour is shut in by a sluice which can be opened only when the water within and without has nearly the same level. Of the massive walls by which Hoorn was formerly surrounded few indications are left except in the shape of promenades and gardens; but two of the old gateways, the East Gate and the Cow Gate, and a few towers still remain. The West Gate is gone, with its monument to the filial piety of Lambert Meliszoon, a young man who by heroic exertions managed to bring his aged mother to refuge within the town when the country around was overrun by the Spaniards in 1579. Most of the ordinary houses are old-fashioned, and interesting from the sculptures or carvings with which they are decorated; but the public buildings have little to boast of in the way of architectural excellence or peculiarity. It is enough to mention the town-house (formerly the state college), the weigh-house, the old admiralty-house or princes’ court, the house of correction (formerly the admiralty magazine), the old mint, occupied as barracks, the new infirmary, the orphanage, and the old women’s hospital. Of the eight churches the principal is the Groote Kerk, occupying the site of the famous 14th century edifice of the same name, which perished by fire in 1838. A communal high school, a Latin school, a medical and chemical society, and a branch of the society Tot nut van 't Algemeen are the main [9:12:156] educational institutions. The extensive foreign commerce which Hoorn enjoyed in the 16th and 17th centuries has almost entirely vanished; but there is still a good trade with other parts of the Netherlands, especially in cheese and cattle. The annual export of cheese is about 23,000 tons. Saw-mills and boat-building yards are the chief industrial establishments. The population was 8780 in 1870, and 9763 in 1876. Of the 9391 inhabitants in the commune in 1870, 5112 belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church, 2954 were Roman Catholics, and 386 were Jews.

Hoorn, Latinized as Horna or Hornum, has existed at least from the first part of the 14th century, as it is mentioned in a document of the year 1311, five years earlier than the date usually assigned for its foundation. It was at Hoorn in 1416 that the first great net was made for the herring fishery, an industry which long proved an abundant source of wealth to the town. During the 15th century Hoorn shared in the troubles occasioned by the different factions; in 1518 it was molested by Groote Pier, and in 1566 and 1567 by Henry of Brederode. The Spanish forces entered the town in 1569; but in 1572 it cast in its lot with the States of the Netherlands, and four years later it assisted in defeating the duke of Alva’s admiral, Count de Bossu,who remained for some time a prisoner· within its walls. The riot against the burgomaster Langewagen in 1672 was a matter of purely local interest. A company of commerce and navigation was formed at Hoorn in 1720; but on the other hand, in 1795, the admiralty offices and storehouses were removed to Medemblik. The English under Abercromby took possession of the town in 1799, and in 1811 it suffered severely from the French. Among the celebrities of Hoorn are William Schonten, who discovered in 1616 the passage round Cape Horn or Hoorn, as he called it in honour of his birthplace; Abel Janszoon Tasman, whose fame is associated with Tasmania; and Jan Pieters Koen, the founder of Batavia.
