HORNE, George (1730-1792), bishop of Norwich, was born on November 1, 1730, at Otham near Maidstone, where his father was a clergyman, and received his early education at the Maidstone school, whence he proceeded to University College, Oxford. In 1749 he became a fellow of Magdalen College, of which in 1768 he was appointed president. As a preacher he early attained great popularity; and his reputation was further helped by several clever if somewhat wrong headed publications, including a satirical pamphlet entitled The Theology and Philosophy of Cicero's Somnium Scipionis (1751), a defence of the Hutchinsonians in A Fair, Candid, and Imparti d State of the Case between Sir Isaac Newton and Mr Hutchinson (1753), and critiques upon Dr Shuckford (1754) and Dr Kennicott (1760). In 1776 he published his well-known Commentary on the Book of Psalms, and in the same year he was chosen vice-chancellor of his university; in 1781 he was made dean of Canterbury, and in 1790 he was raised to the see of Norwich, which, however, he held for less than two years. He died at Bath January 17, 1792.

His collected Works were first published, with a Memoir by one of his chaplains (Jones), in 1795. There have been several subsequent editions, the latest being that of 1830. The most popular and also the best of his writings, the Commentary on the Psalms, has been still more frequently reprinted, occasionally along with an essay by James Montgomery, or with a much more remarkable discourse by Edward Irving.
