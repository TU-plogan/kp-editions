HONORIUS II.^[1. This name had been assumed in the previous century (1061-64) by Peter Cadalus; but he never was recognized as a legitimate pope. ] (Lambert of Ostia), pope from 1124 to 1130, succeeded Calixtus II. As papal legate he had been one of the framers of the concordat of Worms (1122). During his pontificate the Praemonstratensian order, and also that of the Knights Templars, received papal sanction. His successor was Innocent II.
