HOLLYHOCK (from M.E. holi —doubtless because brought from the Holy Land, where it is indigenous (Wedg. ) —and A.-S. hoc, a mallow), Althaea rosea, L., a perennial plant of the natural order Malvaceae and tribe Malveae, a native of the East, has been cultivated in Great Britain for about three centuries. The ordinary hollyhock is single-blossomed, but the florists’ varieties have all double flowers, of white, yellow, rose, purple, violet, and other tints, some being almost black. The plant is in its prime about August, but .by careful managemerrt examples may be obtained in blossom from July to as late as November. Hollyhocks are propagated from seed, or by division of the root, or by planting out in rich sandy soil, in a close frame, with a gentle bottom heat, single eyes from woodshoots, or cuttings from outgrowths of the old stock or of the lateral offsets of the spike. The seed may be sown in October under cover, the plants obtained being potted in November, and kept under glass till the following April, or, if it be late-gathered, in May or June, in the open ground, whence, if required, the plants are best removed in October or April. Seedlings may also be raised [9:12:103] in February or March, by the aid of a gentle heat, in a light and rich moist soil; they should - not be watered till they have made their second leaves, and when large enough for handling should be pricked off in a cold frame; they are subsequently transferred to the flower-bed. Hollyhocks thrive best in a well-trenched and manured sandy loam. The spikes as they grow must be staked; aud water and, for the finest blossoms, liquid manure should be liberally supplied to the roots. Plants for exhibition require pruning of side growths; and it is recommended, when the flowering is over, and the stalks have been cut off 4 to 6 inches above the soil, to earth up the crowns with sand. Some of the finest double-flowered kinds of hollyhock will not bloom well in Scotland. The plant is susceptible of great modification under cultivation. The forms now grown are due to the careful selection and crossing of varieties, first by Mr Charles Baron, a shoemaker at Saffron-Walden, and afterwards by Mr Paul of Cheshunt, Messrs R. B. Bircham, W. Chater, Downie & Laird, John Laing, Anthony Parsons, and other well-known floriculturists. It is found that the most diverse varieties may be raised with certainty from plants growing near together. Darwin from the seed of 11 out of 18 varieties procured 62 plants, all perfectly true to their kind, and from the seed of the remaining 7 varieties 49 plants, half true and half false. Mr Masters of Canterbury, he relates, saved seed from a great bed of 24 named varieties planted in closely adjoining rows, each of which faithfully reproduced itself, with only sometimes a shade of difference in tint. Since the abundant pollen of the hollyhock becomes ripe, and is for the most part shed, before the stigma of the flower affording it is ready for its reception, the preservation of the individuality of different varieties flourishing side by side, in spite of the frequent visits of bees (unless, as suggested by Mr Turner of Slough, those insects be debarred access to the pollen and stigmas by the doubleness of the flowers), would appear to be due to the prepotency of the pollen of each variety on its own stigma over that of all other plants. The hollyhock is very liable to the attacks of slugs, and to a disease occasioned by a fungus, Puccinia malvacearum, which, originally from South America, attained notoriety in the Australian colonies, and finally, reaching Europe, threatened the extermination of the hollyhock, the soft parts of the leaves of which it destroys, leaving the venation only remaining.

It has been found especially hurtful to the plant in dry seasons. Wild mallows, upon which also it is parasitic, do not appear to be very injuriously affected by it. As means of getting rid of this pest the following expedients have been resorted to :—the application of a weak aqueous solution of Condy’s fluid, which in killing it turns its natural light grey colour to a rusty black, or of a strong solution of soft soap with sulphur (“Gishurst compound ”); the destruction of the plants, and their replacement by healthy stocks; and, as practised by Mr Chater, cultivation in highly-manured trenches, with all possible exposure to the open air, and mulching during summer.
