HOO-CHOW-FOO, a city of China, in the province of Che-Keang, lies a little to the south of Lake Tai-hoo, in the midst of the central silk district. According to Chinese authorities, it is 6 miles in circumference, and contains about 100,000 families; but Fortune thinks it is not more than 3 or 4 miles round. A broad stream or canal crosses the city from south to north, and forms the principal highway for boat traffic. The main trade of the place is [9:12:145] in raw silk, but some silk fabrics, such as flowered crape (jchoisha), are also manufactured. Silk is largely worn even by the lowest classes of the inhabitants.
