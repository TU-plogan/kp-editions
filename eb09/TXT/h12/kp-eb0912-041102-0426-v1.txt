HUTCHINSON, John (1674-1737), the author of Moses's Principia and other works in which the so-called Hutchinsonian system is expounded, was born at Spenni-thorne, Yorkshire, in 1674, and after receiving an adequate elementary education there, served as steward in several families of position, latterly in that of the duke of Somerset, who ultimately obtained for him the post of riding purveyor to the master of the horse, a sinecure worth about .£200 a year. In this employment he became acquainted with Dr Woodward, physician to the duke, and author of a work entitled The Natural History of the Earth, to whom ha [9:12:412] entrusted a large number of fossils of his own collecting, along with a mass of manuscript notes, for arrangement and publication. A misunderstanding as to the manner in which these should be dealt with was the immediate occasion of the publication by Hutchinson in 1724 of Moses's Principia, part i., in which Woodward’s Natural History was bitterly ridiculed, his conduct with regard to the mineralogical specimens not obscurely characterized, and a refutation of the Newtonian doctrine of gravitation seriously attempted. It was followed by part ii. in 1727, and by various other works published at frequent intervals. Hutchinson died in 1737. A complete edition of all the publications of this author, along with his posthumous pieces, edited by Robert Spearman and Julius Bate, appeared in 1748 (12 vols.); an Abstract of these followed in 1753; and a Supplement, with Life by Spearman prefixed, in 1765.

Although the crude ideas of Hutchinson at the time of their first promulgation were successful, by their seeming devoutness, in commending themselves to some of the pious but dim-sighted and over-timid souls of that period, who had taken alarm at the atheistic conclusions they believed to be deducible from the Newtonian doctrines, they are now too uninfluential, as well as too glaringly inconsistent with the universally recognized principles of physics and philology, to call for any detailed analysis. Their nature may be almost sufficiently gathered from the titles of some of the works in which they are set forth, such as Moses's Ρriηdpiα, Parti.; of the Invisible Parts of Matter, of Motion, of Visible Forms, and of their Dissolution and Reformation; Moses's Principia, Part II.; of the Circulation of the Heavens; of the Cause of the Motion and Course of the Earth, Moon, <kc.; of the Religion, Philosophy, and Emblems of the Heathens before Moses writ., and of the Jews after; in Confirmation of the Natural History of the Bible; Moses's Sine Principio, represented by Names, JVords, Types, Emblems; with an introduction to show the Nature of the Fall, of Paradise, and of the Body and Soul; The Confusion of Tongues and Trinity of the Gentiles (being an account of the origin of Idolatry); Power Essential and Mechanical, or what power belongs to God and what to his creatures, in which the design of Sir I. Newton and Dr Samuel Clarke is laid open; Glory or Gravity, wherein the Objects and Articles of the Christian Faith are exhibited; The Religion of Satan, or Antichrist Delineated. Bishop Horne of Norwich, it may be mentioned, was during some of his earlier years an avowed Hutchinsonian; and Jones of Nayland continued to be so to the end of his life.
