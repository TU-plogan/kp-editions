+====================================================================+


HOOKE, Robert (1635-1703), an original and ingenious experimental philosopher, was born at Freshwater, in the Isle of Wight, July 18, 1635. His father, who was minister of the parish, destined him for the church; but his constitutional ill-health precluded study, and threw him instead on the resources afforded by his precocious mechanical genius. From the workshop of Sir Peter Lely, where he was placed after his father’s death in 1648, he was transferred to the house of Dr Busby, master of Westminster School; and there his education progressed with surprising rapidity both in its classical and mathematical branches. In 1653 he entered Christ Church, Oxford, as servitor; and ten years later he took his M.A. degree by special recommendation of Lord Clarendon, then chancellor of the university. After 1655 he was employed and patronized by the Hon. Robert Boyle, who turned his skill to account in the construction of his celebrated air-pump. Hooke’s inventive faculty exercised itself, between 1657 and 1659, in devising tlιirty different methods of flying, and more profitably in regulating the movement of watches by the application of the balance spring. In 1675 a lively controversy arose between him and Huygens respecting their rival claims to this ingenious invention. The truth seems to be that the original idea belonged to Hooke, but that the coiled form of the spring, on which its practical utility depends, was due to Huygens. On the 12th of November 1662 Hooke was appointed curator of experiments to the Royal Society, and filled the office with extraordinary diligence and skill during the remainder of his life. In 1664 Sir John Cutler instituted for his benefit a mechanical lectureship of £50 a year, and in the following year he was nominated professor of geometry in Gresham College, where he subsequently resided. After the great fire of 1666 he constructed a model for the rebuilding of the city, which was highly approved, although the design of Wren was preferred. During the progress of the works, however, Hooke acted as surveyor, aud accumulated in that lucrative employment a sum of several thousand pounds, discovered after his death in an old iron chest, which had evidently lain unopened for above thirty years. He fulfilled the duties of secretary to the Royal Society during five years after the death of Oldenburg in 1677, publishing in 1681-82 the papers read before that body under the title of Philosophical Collections. A protracted controversy with Hevelius, in which Hooke urged the advantages of telescopic over plain sights, brought him little but discredit. His reasons were good; but his offensive style of argument rendered them unpalatable and himself unpopular. Many circumstances concurred to embitter the latter years of his life. The death, in 1687, of his niece, Mrs Grace Hooke, who had lived with him for many years, caused him deep affliction; a law suit with Sir John Cutler about his salary (decided, however, in his favour in 1696) occasioned him prolonged anxiety; and the repeated anticipation of his discoveries inspired him with a morbid jealousy. Marks of public respect were not indeed wanting to him. A degree of M.D. was conferred on him at Doctors’ Commons, December 7, 1691, and the Royal Society made him, in 1696, a grant to enable him to complete his philosophical inventions. While engaged on this task he died, worn out with disease and toil, March 3, 1703, and was buried in St Helen’s Church, Bishopsgate Street.

In personal appearance Hooke made but a sorry show. His figure was crooked, his limbs shrunken; his hair hung in dishevelled locks over his haggard countenance. His temper was irritable, his habits penurious and solitary. He was, however, blameless in morals, and reverent in religion. His scientific performances would probably have been more striking if they had been less varied. He originated much, but perfected little. His optical investigations[9:12:150] led him to adopt in an imperfect form the undulatory theory of light, to anticipate the doctrine of interference, and to observe, independently of though subsequently to Grimaldi, the phenomenon of diffraction. He was the first to state clearly that the motions of the heavenly bodies must be regarded as a mechanical problem, and he approached in a remarkable manner the discovery of universal gravitation. He suggested a method of meteorological forecasting and a system of telescopic signalling, anticipated Chladni’s experiment of strewing a vibrating bell with flour, investigated the nature of sounds and the function of· the air in respiration and combustion, and originated the idea of using the pendulum as a measure of gravity.

His principal writings are Micrographin, 1664; Lectiones Cutleri- anae, 1674-79; and Posthumous lVorks, containing a sketch of his “Philosophical Algebra,” published by Waller in 1705.
