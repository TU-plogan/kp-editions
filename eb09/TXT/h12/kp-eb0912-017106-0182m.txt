HORNPIPE was originally the name of an instrument no longer in existence, and is now used for an English national dance. The sailor’s hornpipe, although the most common, is by no means the only form of the dance, for there is a pretty tune known as the “College Hornpipe,” and other specimens of a similar kind might be cited. The [9:12:172] composition of hornpipes flourished chiefly in the last century, and even Handel did not disdain to use the characteristic rhythm. The hornpipe may be written in f∙ or in common time, and is always of a lively nature.
