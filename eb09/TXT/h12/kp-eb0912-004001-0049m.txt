HOBOKEN, a city and port of entry of the United States, in Hudson county, New Jersey, is situated on the Hudson river, contiguous to Jersey city, which stretches immediately to the south. It lies opposite New York city, ∣ of a mile distant, and occupies a picturesque site at the foot of a steep hill, with a considerable river frontage. The principal public buildings are the Stevens institute of technology, the bequest of the late Commodore Stevens, whose mansion in the Gothic style of architecture is a noteworthy feature of the place; St Mary’s Catholic hospital; and the Franklin lyceum association library. The manufactories include iron-foundries and a lead pencil work; and the trade in coal is important. Castle Point and the adjoining “Elysian Fields” afford delightful views of the river, and, before the recent building operations, used to be a favourite resort of the New-Yorkers. The city, which was originally settled by the Dutch, who named it after a village on the Scheldt, was incorporated in 1855. Population in 1870, 20,000; in 1880, 30,999.
