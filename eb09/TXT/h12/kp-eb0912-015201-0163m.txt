HOOKER, Sir William Jackson (1785-1865), a distinguished English botanist, was born at Norwich, July 6, 1785. His father, Joseph Hooker of Exeter, a member of the same family as the celebrated Richard Hooker, devoted much of his time to the study of German literature and the cultivation of curious plants. The son was educated at the high school of Norwich, on leaving which his independent means enabled him to travel and to take up as a recreation the study of natural history, especially ornithology and entomology. He subsequently confined his attention to botany, on the recommendation of Sir James E. Smith, whom he had consulted respecting a rare moss picked up in a ramble. His first botanical expedition was made in Iceland, in the summer of 1809, at the suggestion of Sir Joseph Banks; but the natural history specimens which he collected, with his notes and drawings, were lost on the homeward voyage through the burning of the ship, and the young botanist himself had a narrow escape with his life. A good memory, however, aided him to publish an account of the island, and of its inhabitants and flora (Tour in Iceland, 1809), privately circulated in 1811, and reprinted in 1813. In 1810-11 he made extensive preparations, and sacrifices which proved financially serious, with a view to accompany Sir R. Brownrigg to Ceylon to explore that teeming though then almost unknown island; but the disturbances created by the king of Candy led to the abandonment of the projected expedition. Hooker immediately fixed his attention, however, on the formation of an herbarium which was destined to-become the finest in Europe; and in 1814 he spent nine· months in botanizing excursions in France, Switzerland, and Northern Italy, during which he became acquainted with many of the leading Continental botanists. The following year he married the eldest daughter of Mr Dawson Turner, F.R.S., a lady who, during forty years, shared in the labours of his study. Settling at Holes-worth[9:12:153], Suffolk, he continued to increase his herbarium, which became the resort and admiration of British and Continental botanists. In 1816 appeared the British Jungermannice, his first scientific work, which is even now a model of microscopic dissection and of accurate description and figuring. This was succeeded by a new edition of Curtis’s Flora Londinensis, for which he wrote the descriptions (1817-28); by a description of the Plantae Cryptogamicae of A. de Humboldt and A. Bonpland; by the Muscologia Britannica, a very complete account of the mosses of Great Britain and Ireland, prepared in conjunction with Dr T. Taylor (1818); and by his Musci Exotici, 2 vols. (1818-20), devoted to new foreign mosses and other cryptogamie plants. In 1820 he accepted the regius professorship of botany in Glasgow university, and entered upon a new career of activity, in which he soon became popular as a lecturer, his style being both clear and ready. The following year he brought out the Flora Scotica, in which the natural method of arrangement of British plants was given with the artificial. During the twenty years he remained at Glasgow he prepared and took part in many works, the more important being the following

The Botanical Illustrations; Exotic Flora, indicating such of the specimens as are deserving cultivation, 3 vols. 1822-27; Account of Sabine's Arctic Plants, 1824; Catalogue of Plants in the Glasgow Botanic Garden, 1825; the Botany of Parry s Third Voyage, 1826; The Botanical Magazine, 1827-65, 38 vols.; Iconxs Filicum, in concert with Dr R. K. Greville, 1829-31, 2 vols.; British Flora, of which several editions appeared, undertaken with Dr G. A. W. Arnott, 1830, &c.; British Flora Cryptogamia (Fungi), 1833; Characters of Genera from the British Flora, 1830; Flora Boreali-Americana, 1840, 2 vols., being the botany of British North America collected in Sir J. Franklin’s voyage; The Journal of Botany, 1830-42, 4 vols.; Companion to the Botanical Magazine, 1835-36, 2 vols.; Icones Plantarum, 1837-54, 10 vols.; the Botany of Βeecheιfs Voyage to the Pacific and Behring's Straits (with Dr Arnott, 1841); the Genera Filicum, 1842, from the original coloured drawings of F. Bauer, with additions and descriptive letterpress; The London Journal of Botany, 1842-48, 7 vols.; Notes on the Botany of the Antarctic Voyage of the Erebτιs and Terror, 1843; Species Filicum, 1846-64, 5 vols., the standard work on this subject; A Century of Orchidcae, 1846; Journal of Botany and Kew Garden Miscellany, 1849-57, 9 vols. In 1849 he edited the Niger Flora of Vogel, and the Rhododendrons of Sikkim, Victoria Regia, 1851; Museum of Economic Botany at Kew, 1855; Filices Exotici, 1857-59; The British Ferns, 1861-62; A Century of Ferns, 1854; A Second Century of Ferns, 1860-61. The estimation in which he held his patron the duke of Bedford is shown in the Letter on his grace’s death printed in 1840, calling attention to the services rendered by him to botany and horticulture.

It was mainly by Hooker’s exertions that botanists were appointed to the Government expeditions. While his works were in progress his herbarium received large and valuable additions from all parts of the globe, and his position as a botanist was thus vastly improved. He received the honour of knighthood from William IV. in 1836 in consideration of his meritorious researches in scientific botany; and a few years later, in 1841, he was appointed director of the Royal Botanical Gardens of Kew, on the resignation of Mr Alton. The attainment of this post had long been the object of his life. The gardens flourished under his administration; the Government had confidence in him; and his numerous friends and correspondents took pride in contributing to the scientific needs of his herbarium. From small beginnings the gardens expanded under his direction to 75 acres, with an arboretum of 270 acres; and three museums, enriched with many thousand examples of vegetable products, have been added, forming together, with the magnificent palm-house and conservatories, the most delightful and beautiful resort that the inhabitants of London possess; while his extensive library of reference and admirably arranged herbarium, the greater part of which was presented by Sir William to the country, form a constant attraction to the botanist. He was engaged on the Synopsis Filicum with J. G. Baker when an epidemic at Kew brought his valuable life to a close. He died August 12, 1865, in the eighty-first year of his age.
