HUYSMANS. Four painters of this family matriculated in the Antwerp guild in the 17th century. Cornelis the elder, apprenticed in 1633, passed for a mastership in 1636, and remained obscure. Jacob, apprenticed to Frans Wouters in 1650, wandered to England towards the close of the reign of Charles II., and competed with Lely as a fashionable portrait painter. He executed a portrait of the queen, Catherine of Braganza, now in the national portrait gallery, and Horace Walpole assigns to him the likeness of Lady Bellasys, now catalogued at Hampton Court as a work of Lely. His portrait of Izaak Walton in the National Gallery shows a disposition to imitate the styles of Rubens and Van Dyke. According to most accounts he died in London in 1696. Jan Baptist Huysmans, born at Antwerp in 1654, matriculated in 1676-77, and died there in 1715-16. He was younger brother to Cornelis Huysmans the second, who was born at Antwerp in 1648, and educated by Gâspar de Wit and Jacob van Artois. Of Jan Baptist little or nothing has been preserved, except that he registered numerous apprentices at Antwerp, and painted a landscape dated 1697 now in the Brussels museum. But for the signature critics would assign this piece to his brother. Cornelis the second is the only master of the name of Huysmans whose talent was largely acknowledged. He chanced to receive lessons from two artists, one of whom was familiar with the Roman art of the Poussins, whilst the other inherited the scenic style of the school of Rubens. He combined the two in a rich, highly coloured, and usually effective style, which, however, was not free from monotony. Seldom attempting anything but woodsidc views with fancy backgrounds, half Italian, half Flemish, he painted with great facility, and left numerous examples behind. At the outset of his career he practised at Malines, where he married in 1682, and there too he entered into some business connexion with Van der Meulen, for whom he painted some backgrounds. In 1706 he withdrew to Antwerp, [9:12:418] where he resided till 1717, returning then to Malines, where he died on the 1st of June 1727.

Though most of his pictures were composed for cabinets rather than churches, he sometimes emulated Van Artois in the production of large sacred pieces, and for many years his Christ on the Road to Emmaus adorned the choir of Notre Dame of Malines. In the gallery of Nantes, where three of hissmall landscapes are preserved, tι∣ere hangs an Investment of Luxembourg, by Van der Meulen, of which lie is known to have laid in the background. The two national galleries of London and Edinburgh contain each one example of his skill. Blenheim, too, and other private galleries in England, possess one or more of his pictures. But most of his works are on the Continent,—four a-piece in the Louvre, Augsburg, and Stuttgart; three a-piece in Berlin, Brunswick, Cologne, and Munich; two in Cassel and St Petersburg; one at Antwerp, Brussels, Carlsruhe, Copenhagen, Dresden, and Hanover.
