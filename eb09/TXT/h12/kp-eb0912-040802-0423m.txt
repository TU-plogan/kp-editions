HUSZT, a market-town in the county of MAramaros, Hungary, is situated at the confluence of the Nagy-Äg with the Theiss, and about midway on the line of railway from SzatmAr-Németi to MAramaros-Sziget, 48° 10'N. lat., 23° 18' E. long. At Huszt there are Calvinist, Roman Catholic, and Old United Greek churches, royal law courts, and other Government offices. On an elevated and picturesque position near the town are the ruins of an old fortress. In the neighbourhood of Huszt flax and cereals are largely grown, and many of the inhabitants find employment in fishing. The population in 1870 was 6413, consisting for the most part of Magyars and Ruthenians.
