HUTCHINSON, Thomas (1711-1780), governor of the province of Massachusetts, son of a wealthy merchant of Boston, was born there September 9, 1711. The son, being unsuccessful in commerce, studied law, and adopted it as his profession. He was representative of Boston in the general court for ten years, and was three times chosen speaker. From 1749 to 1766 he was a counsellor, in 1752 he was appointed judge of probate, from 1758 to 1771 he was lieutenant-governor, and in 1760 he became chief justice. In 1748 he carried a measure to substitute gold and silver for the paper currency, which had depreciated one-eighth in value. During the Stamp Act riots of 1765 his house was sacked by the mob; and by his subsequent support of the general policy of the British Government he incurred increasing unpopularity. In 1767 he laid claim to a seat in the council on the ground of being lieutenant-governor, but on account of his political views his claims were set aside. On his appointment to the governorship of Massachusetts in 1769, he used every method to support the measures which the mother country sought to enforce against the colonists; and in December 1773, on account of his refusal to permit the reshipment of teas on which a duty had been laid by the Government, several of the inhabitants of Boston emptied the tea into the bay. In January 1774 Hutchinson asked leave to resign his office, and in June he sailed to England, where he spent the remainder of his life. As the result of official inquiry into his conduct while governor of Massachusetts, he was rewarded with a pension. He died at Brompton in June 1780.

Hutchinson was the author of the following works:— A Brief Statement of the Claim of the Colonies, 1764; Collection of Original Papers relative to the History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay, 1769; History of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay from 1628 to 1750, 2 vols., London, 1765—67; History of Massachusetts from 1749 to 1774, published posthumously in 1828.
