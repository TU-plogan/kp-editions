HUÉ, or Hue-foo (variously called Quang-duk, Phu-thua-thien, and San Hué), the capital of the kingdom of Anam, is situated in a province of its own name, on the left bank of the Truông-Tiên or Hué river, which falls into the Chinese Sea about 8 miles further down in 16° 34' 28" N. lat. and 107° 38' 39" E. long. The surrounding country is a flat alluvial plain, traversed by streams and canals, and largely occupied by extensive rice-fields; to the south-west, at a distance of about 3 or 4 miles, rise the Ai-van hills, of which Hondun has a height of 1445 feet. The centre of Hué is formed by the citadel, which was built in the reign of Gialong (d. 1820) after the plans of the French colonel Olivier. It is 7323 feet square, has six equal bastions on each side, and is surrounded by ditches about 120 feet in width, but not more than 5 or 6 feet in depth. Within are the royal residence, the houses of the ministers, the treasury, the arsenal, the barracks, &c.,—the royal residence, or Thanh Noi, having a special encincture of its own, measuring about 2290 feet each way. The inner town or citadel has a population of 30,000, inclusive of the garrison, and there are nearly as many in the suburbs and marketvillages within a radius of 2⅜ miles. The suburb of Mang-Sa (i.e., Fish Mouth) at the north-east corner of the citadel is the centre of the local traffic, and the neighbouring part of the river serves as an inner harbour. At the village Thanh Phuoc, about 2 miles below the town, are the winter [9:12:334] quarters for the Anamese fleet, and in its vicinity is a shipbuilding yard and docks. On the landward slope of the sand-dune which lies between the sea and the lagoon at the river mouth stretches the village of Thuân, with about 1400 inhabitants, and serving as a sort of port to the capital. During the rainy season, October to January, the level of the Truông-Tiên rises about 3 feet, and all the plain is laid under water. No European residents are permitted at Hué, except the members of the French legation, who have been allowed to erect consular buildings on the right bank of the river, there 1180 feet wide, directly opposite the citadel.
