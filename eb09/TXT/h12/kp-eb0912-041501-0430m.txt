HUY, in Flemish Hoey, a town of Belgium, at the head of an arrondissement in the province of Liège, situated in the most romantic portion of the Meuse valley near the confluence of the Hoyoux, on the railway between Liege and Namur, and about 20 miles west of the former city. It lies on both banks of the river, and the two portions are united by a bridge about 460 feet long. Of best note among the buildings are the town-house, the court-house, the hospital, and the collegiate church of Notre Dame, which is an excellent specimen of Gothic architecture, dating originally from the 14th century, but restored in the course of the 16th and the 19th. The citadel of Huy is now demolished. It was a powerful fortress, constructed between 1817 and 1822 on the site of the older castle dismantled by the Dutch in 1718. Part of the works were excavated in the solid rock, and the whole building looked down on the valley of the Meuse with picturesque defiance. Of the industrial activity of the town the most important results are paper, tin-plate, zinc, iron, earthenware, and brandy; and iron, zinc, and coal are extensively wrought in the vicinity. The population in 1876 was 11,774.

Huy, in modern Latin Hoium, Hogurn, Huyum, and Huum, existed at least as early as the 7th century, and according to some authorities it was founded in 148 by the emperor Antoninus. Coins of Charles the Simple are extant with the legend in Vico Hoio. The older name of the district in which it is situated was the Condroz, or territory of the Condrosii. Under the princebishops of Liège Huy was a prosperous place, and it possessed no fewer than fifteen churches, as well as a number of monasteries, fora population of about 5000. It was in one of its suburbs that the abbey of Neufrnoustier was founded by Peter the Hermit, who died and was buried within its precincts (1115). Part of the cloisters are still standing; and a monument was erected iu 1858 by Μ. Godin, the owner of the grounds, to mark the site of the hermit’s tomb. Huy was captured by the Dutch in 1595, and in 1693 it was taken and burned by the French. The Dutch were in possession from 1702 till 1718, when they restored the town to the emperor.
