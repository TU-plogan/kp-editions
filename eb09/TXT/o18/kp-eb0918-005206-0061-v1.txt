ORTHONYX, the scientific name given in 1820, by Temminck, to a little bird, which, from the straightness of its claws,—a character somewhat exaggerated by him,— its large feet and spiny tail, he judged to be generically distinct from any other form. Concerning its affinities much doubt has long prevailed, and this has been only lately set at rest. The typical species, O. spinicauda, is from south-eastern Australia, where it is said to be very local in its distribution, and strictly terrestrial in its habits. In the course of time two other small birds from New Zealand, where they are known as the “Whitehead” and “Yellowhead,” were referred to the genus, under the names of O. albicilla ^[1. It may be charitably conjectured that the nomenclator intended to write albicanilla.] and O. ochrocephala, and then the question of its affinity became more interesting. By some systematists it was supposed to belong to the otherwise purely Neotropical Dendrocolaptidae, and in that case would have been the sole representative of the Tracheo[9:18:53]phone Passeres in the Australian Region. Others considered it one of the nearest relatives of Menura, and if that view were correct it would add a third form to the small section of Pseudoscines (see Lyre-Bird, vol. xv. p. 115); while Sundevall, in 1872, placed it not far from Timelia, among a group the proper sorting of which will probably for years tax the ingenuity of ornithologists. The late Mr W. A. Forbes shewed (Proc. Zool. Soc., 1882, p. 544) that this last position was the most correct, as Orthonyx spinicauda proved on dissection to be one of the true Oscines, but yet to stand, so far as is known, alone among birds of that group, or any other group of Passeres, in consequence of the superficial course taken by the (left) carotid artery, which is nowhere contained in the subvertebral canal. Whether this discovery will require the segregation of the genus as the representative of a separate Family Orthonycidae — which has been proposed by Mr Salvin (Catal. Coll. Strickland, p. 294)—remains to be seen. Forbes also demonstrated that one at least of the two New-Zealand species above mentioned, 0. ochrocephala, had been wrongly referred to this genus, and they therefore at present stand as Clitonyx. This is a point of some little importance in its bearing on the relationship of the fauna of the two countries, for Orthonyx was supposed to be one of the few genera of Land-birds common to both.

The typical species of Orthonyx—for the scientific name has been adopted in English—is rather larger than a Skylark, coloured above not unlike a Hedge-Sparrow. The wings are, however, barred with white, and the chin, throat, and breast are in the male pure white, but of a bright reddish-orange in the female. The remiges are very short, rounded, and much incurved, showing a bird of weak flight. The rectrices are very broad, the shafts stiff, and towards the tip divested of barbs. Two other species that seem rightly to belong to the genus have been described— 0. spaldingi from Queensland, of much greater size than the type, and with a jet-black plumage, and 0. novae-guineae, from the great island of that name, which seems closely to resemble 0. spinicauda.
