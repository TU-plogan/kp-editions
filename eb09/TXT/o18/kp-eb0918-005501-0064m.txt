OSHKOSH, a city of the United States, capital of Winnebago county, Wisconsin, stretches from the west side of Lake Winnebago for about 3 miles up Fox River to Lake Buttes des Morts, and covers an area of about 8 square miles. By rail the distance from Milwaukee is 84 miles. Oshkosh is the seat of the United States district court for the eastern district of Wisconsin; and, besides the court-house, it contains the State normal school, a fine high school, and two opera-houses. The leading industry is the manufacture of sashes, doors, and blinds. Lumber shingles, matches, trunks, and carriages are also manufactured, and there are foundries, matchfactories, flour-mills, and breweries. The population was 6085 in 1860, 12,663 in 1870, and 15,748 in 1880. Oshkosh may be said to date from 1836; it was incorporated in 1853. In 1859, 1866, 1874, and 1875 it suffered severely from conflagrations.
