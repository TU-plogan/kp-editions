OTTENSEN, a town of Prussia, in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, lies on the right bank of the Elbe, immediately below Altona, of which it practically forms a part. It contains numerous villas of Hamburg merchants, and carries on manufactures of machinery, tobacco, soap, gilt frames and cornices, glass, iron, and other articles. Ottensen, which received its municipal charter in 1871, contained 15,375 inhabitants at the census of 1880. The three “Graves of Ottensen,” besung by the poet Rückert, are those of 1138 citizens, who were expelled from Hamburg by Marshal Davoust in 1813-14, and perished here, of Charles, duke of Brunswick, who died at Ottensen of wounds received at the battle of Jena, and of Klopstock and his wife Meta. The last alone now remains.
