OXYNOTUS, the name of a genus of birds now ascertained to be peculiar to two of the Mascarene Islands— Mauritius and Réunion (Bourbon)—where the name of Cuisinier is applied to them, and remarkable for the fact, almost if not quite unique in Ornithology,^[1. The only other instance cited by Darwin (Descent of Man, ii. pp. 192, 193) is that of two species of Paradisea ; but therein the males differ from one another to a far greater degree than do those of Oxynotus. ] that, while the males of both species are almost identical in appearance, the females are wholly unlike each other. Though the habits of the Mauritian species, 0. rufiventer, have been very fairly observed, there seems to be nothing in them that might account for the peculiarity. The genus Oxynotus is generally placed in the group known as Campophagidae, most or all of which are distinguished from the Laniidae. (to which they seem nearly allied) by the feathers on the lower part of the back and on the rump having the basal portion of the shaft very stiff and the distal portion soft— a structure which makes that part of the body, on being touched by the finger, feel as though it were beset with blunt prickles. Hence the name of the genus conferred by Swainson, and intended to signify “prickly back.” The males, which look rather like miniature Grey Shrikes (Lanius excubitor and others), are—except on close examination, when some slight differences of build and shade become discernible—quite indistinguishable; but the female of the one species has a reddish-brown back, and is bright ferruginous beneath, while the female of the other species is dull white beneath, transversely barred, as are the females of some Shrikes, with brown. Both sexes of each species, and the young of one of them, are described and figured in The Ibis for 1866 (pp. 275-280, pls. vii. and viil). (a. n.)
