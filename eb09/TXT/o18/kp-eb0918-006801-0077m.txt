OTLEY, a market-town in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is picturesquely situated on the south bank of the Wharfe, at the foot of the precipitous Chevin Hill, 10 miles north of Bradford and 9 south-west of Harrogate. The river is crossed by a stone bridge of seven arches. The church of All Saints contains what is said to be a Saxon doorway belonging to the original building, and several interesting monuments. A free grammar school took its origin from a bequest by Thomas Cave in 1602, and was named in honour of Henry, prince of Wales, son of James I. A mechanics’ institute was erected in 1869 in the Italian style, and a court-house in 1875. Worsted spinning and weaving, machine making, tanning and leather dressing, organ-building, and paper making are the principal industries. Otley is a very old town. It is mentioned in Domesday, the name being possibly derived from Othelai —the field of Otho. The population of the town and urban sanitary district (area 2370 acres) was 5855 in 1871 and 6806 in 1881.
