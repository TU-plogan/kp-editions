OVIEDO, a city in the north of Spain, capital of a province of the same name,^[1. The province of Oviedo, corresponding to the ancient province and principality of Asturias (q.v.), has an area of 4091 square miles and a population (1877) of 576,352. At that census the aynntamientos (besides the capital) having a population exceeding 10,000 were— Càngas de Tinéo, 22,212; Cudillero, 10,113; Gijon, 30,591; Grado, 20,255; Langréo, 12,832; Lena, 11,657; Llanes, 18,637; Miéres, 12,614; Pilofta, 18,648; Salas, 16,394; Siero, 21,494; Tinéo, 21,414; Valdes, 22,014; and Villaviciosa, 20,179. ] stands on a gentle northern slope, about 72 miles by rail and diligence to the north of Leon, and 14 miles to the south of the Bay of Biscay. About a mile to the north-west is the Sierra de Naranco, a Red Sandstone hill 1070 feet above the sea and about 470 above the town, which is thus sheltered from the north wind, but subject in consequence to a large rainfall. Most of the town was burnt in 1521, and the reconstruction, till recently, has been irregular. The four main streets are formed by the roads connecting Gijon and Leon (north and south) and Grado and Santander (east and west), which cross each other in a central square, the Plaza Mayor. The streets are clean and well lighted; the projecting roofs of the houses give a characteristic effect, and some portions of the old Calle de la Plateria are highly picturesque. In the Plaza Mayor are the handsome Casas Consistoriales, dating from the 17th century; one or two deserted mansions of the nobility are architecturally interesting. The university, founded by Philip III. in 1604, is lodged in a plain building, 180 feet square; connected with it are a small library and physical and chemical museums. The cathedral, an elegant Perpendicular building of the 14th century, occupies the site of an earlier edifice, founded in the 8th century, of which only the Camara Santa remains. The west front has a fine portico of ornamented arches between the two towers. Of these one, very richly adorned, has been completed, and is 284 feet high; the other, which is larger, does not as yet rise above the nave. The interior has some fine stained glass, but has been much disfigured with modern rococo additions. The Capilia del Rey Santo (Alphonso II., who died in Oviedo in 843) contains the remains of many successive princes of the house of Pelayo; and the Camara Santa (dating from 802) preserves in an area the crucifix, sudarium, and other relics saved by Don Pelayo in his flight. The cathedral library has some curious old MSS., mostly from Toledo. On the Sierra de Naranco is the ancient Santa Maria de Naranco, originally built by Ramiro in 850 as a palace, and afterwards turned into a church. Higher up the hill is San Miguel de Lino, also of the 9th century; and on the road to Gijon, about a mile outside the town, is the Santullano or church of St Julian, also of very early date. The modern town has the usual equipments in the way of hospitals, schools, theatre, casino, and the like; and in the neighbourhood are some pleasant paseos or promenades (San Francisco, Bombé, Jardin Botanico). The industries of the town include hatmaking and tanning, and there is also a manufactory of arms. The population of the ayuntamiento in 1877 was 34,460.

Oviedo, founded in the reign of Fruela (762), became the fixed residence of the kings of the Asturias in the time of Alphonso the Chaste, and continued to be so until about 924, when the advancing reconquest led them to remove their capital to Leon. From that date the history of the city was comparatively uneventful. It was twice plundered during the war of independence—by Ney in 1809 and by Bonnet in the following year.
