OVEN, a close chamber or compartment in which a considerable degree of heat may be generated either from internal or from external sources. In English the term is generally restricted to a chamber for baking bread and other food substances, being equivalent to the French four or the German Backofen ; but the chambers in which coal is coked are termed coke ovens. See Baking, vol iii. 257, and Coke, vol. vi. 118.
