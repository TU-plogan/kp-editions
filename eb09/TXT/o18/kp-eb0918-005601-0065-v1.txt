OSORIO, Geronymo (1506-1580), “the Cicero of Portugal,” belonged to a noble family, and was born at Lisbon in 1506. After studying languages at Salamanca, philosophy at Paris, and theology at Bologna, he rose through successive ecclesiastical dignities to the bishopric of Sylves. He evaded the necessity of accompanying Dorn Sebastian on his first African expedition (which he did all in his power to discourage) only by setting out for Rome, where he was well received by Gregory XIII. The disaster which overtook the Portuguese arms at Alcazarquivir in 1578 had a serious effect on Osorio’s health and spirits; he withdrew into solitude, and died at Tavira on August 20, 1580.

His principal work, a history of the reign of King Emanuel I. (De rebus Emmanuelis Lusitaniae regis invictissimi virtute et auspicio domi forisque gestis libri XII., 1571), undertaken at the request of Cardinal Henry, entitles him to considerable literary ιank, not only by pure Latinity and artistic arrangement, but also by historical accuracy and insight, as well as by impartiality and elevation of tone. An English translation appeared in 1752; and versions in French, German, and Dutch also exist. Osorio’s De gloria libri V. (1552), and his double treatise De nobilitate civili et de nobilitate Christiana (1542) have been often reprinted; of the former D’Alembert is reported to have declared that it was really a production of Cicero’s palmed off by the modern as his own. Osorio also published "De regis institutione et disciplina libri VIII. (1574) and a large mass of theological matter, including commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, the Gospel according to John, and some of the minor prophets. His Admonitio and Epistola to Queen Elizabeth of England are polemical treatises. The Opera Omnia of Osorio were collected and published at Rome by his nephew in 1592 (4 vols, folio).
