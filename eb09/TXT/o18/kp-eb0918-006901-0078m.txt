OTTAWA, a city of the United States, capital of La Salle county, Illinois, on both sides of the Illinois above and below the mouth of the Fox river (which furnishes abundant water-power by a fall of 29 feet), on the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and at the junction of the Fox river branch of the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railway with the Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railway, 84 miles southwest of Chicago. Ottawa ships large quantities of produce and live stock, and has manufactories of agricultural implements, carriages, glass, and clothing. The more conspicuous buildings are those occupied by the county courts and jail, and the supreme court for the northern division of the State. Near the south bank of the Illinois there are mineral springs possessing important medicinal properties. In 1880 the population was 7834 (811 in South Ottawa).
