ORRIS-ROOT consists of the rhizomes or underground stems of three species of Iris, I. germanica, I. florentina, and I. pallida, closely allied plants growing in subtropical and temperate latitudes, but principally identified with North Italy. The three plants are indiscriminately cultivated in the neighbourhood of Florence as an agricultural product under the name of “ghiaggiuolo.” The rhizomes form joints of annual growth from 3 to 4 inches long; they branch and give off rootlets at the joints, and when these attain five years of age they begin to decay. When taken out of the ground the branches and rootlets are trimmed off, the brown bark removed, and the separated joints are put up to dry and mature. In its fresh condition orrisroot contains an acrid juice and has an earthy odour, but it is quite destitute of the fragrance which ultimately characterizes the substance, and which develops fully only after a lapse of about two years, probably by fermentation. As it comes into the market, orris-root is in the form of contorted sticks and irregular knobby pieces up to 4 inches in length, of a compact chalky appearance, having a delicate but distinct odour of violets. By distillation with water a crystalline body known as orris-camphor or oil of orris, possessing the fragrant properties of orrisroot, is obtained. It is present in exceedingly small quantity, from 040 to 0 - 80 per cent., and Professor Fliickiger has demonstrated that the crude distillate consists only of myristic acid impregnated with or scented by the essential oil of orris, a body which may never be isolated owing to the necessarily minute quantities in which it could be produced.. Orris-root has been a well-known and esteemed perfume from early Greek times. It is principally powdered for use in dentifrices and other scented dry preparations; but to some extent the crude oil is distilled for general perfumery purposes. It is also used in small pellets as issue peas.
