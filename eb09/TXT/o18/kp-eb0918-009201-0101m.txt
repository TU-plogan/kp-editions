OXENSTIERNA, Axel, Count of (1583-1654), Swedish statesman, was born at Fanö in Upland on the 16th of June 1583. He studied theology at Rostock, Wittenberg, and Jena; and in 1602, having spent some time in visiting German courts, he returned to Sweden to take the oath of allegiance to Charles IX., whose service he entered. In 1606 he was sent as ambassador to the court of Mecklenburg, and in 1609 he became a member of the Swedish senate. When Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the throne, in 1611, Oxenstierna was appointed chancellor, and in 1613 he was plenipotentiary in the negotiations for the conclusion of peace between Sweden and Denmark. In 1614 he went -with the king to Livonia, and helped to bring about the cessation of hostilities between Sweden and Russia. After the intervention of Gustavus in the Thirty Years’ War, Oxenstierna was made governor-general of all the districts in Prussia which had been overrun by the Swedes; and, when the Imperialists were preparing to besiege Stralsund, he negotiated with the duke of Pomerania for the substitution of Swedish for Danish troops in the town, going subsequently to Denmark to obtain the sanction of the Danish king. While Gustavus pushed on to Franconia and Bavaria, Oxenstierna was entrusted with the supreme direction of affairs, both political and military, in the Rhine country, and he took up his headquarters at Mainz. In 1632, when Gustavus fell at the battle of Liitzen, the responsibility for the maintenance of the Protestant cause fell chiefly upon Oxenstierna; and in one of the greatest crises in the history of the world he displayed splendid courage, discretion, and resource. At a congress held in Heilbronn he was appointed director of the evangelical confederation, and in this capacity he went [9:18:93] to France and Holland to secure the aid of these countries against the emperor. On his return he found the Protestants in a very desponding mood. The battle of Nördlingen had been lost; the allies distrusted one another; the troops were dissatisfied and resented any attempt to subject them to strict discipline. Oxenstierna laboured indefatigably to restore the confidence of his party, and to a large extent he succeeded. He then returned, in 1636, to Sweden, where he resigned his exceptional powers and resumed his place in the senate as chancellor of the kingdom. He acted also as one of five guardians of Queen Christina, whom he carefully instructed in what seemed to him the true methods of administration. Oxenstierna had the reputation of being one of the wisest statesmen of his age, and during his absence from his country he had drawn up the scheme of a system of government which had been accepted in 1634 by the Swedish estates. Abroad he upheld vigorously the honour of Sweden, and at home he maintained strict economy in public expenditure, while encouraging, according to the ideas of his time, the development of industry and the arts. In 1645, when he went back to Sweden after taking part in the negotiations with Denmark at Brömsebro, he was raised to the rank of count by the queen. He died on the 28th of August 1654.
