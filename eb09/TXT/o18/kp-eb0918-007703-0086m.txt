OVERYSSEL, or Overijssel, a province of Holland, bounded N.W. by the Zuyder Zee, N. by Friesland and [9:18:78] Drenthe, N.E. by Hanover (Prussia), S.E. by Westphalia (Prussia), and S. and S.W. by Guelderland, with an area of 1291 square miles. The southern district belongs to the basin of the Yssel; the northern is watered by the Vecht and various small streams falling into the Zwartewater, the river which was for so many generations the object of dispute between Zwolle and Hasselt. A large proportion of the surface is a sandy flat relieved by hillocks, rising at times to a height of 230 feet above the sea. Husbandry, stock-raising, and dairy-farming are the principal means of subsistence in the province, though the fisheries, turf-cutting, the shipping trade, and a number of manufacturing industries are also of importance. In the district of Twenthe (towards the east) more especially there are a great many cotton-mills and bleaching-works; brick and tile making is prosecuted in the neighbourhood of the Yssel; and along the coast a good many people are engaged in making mats and besoms. During the present century the province has been opened up by the construction of several large canals—the Dedemsvaart, the Noord-Willemsvaart (between the Yssel and the Zwartewater), the “Overyssel canals” (running near the eastern frontier), &e.; and a fairly complete railway system has come into existence. The province is divided into the three administrative districts of Zwolle, Deventer, and Almelo. Its population, 234,376 in 1859 and 263,008 in 1875 (134,201 males, 128,807 females), was 247,136 in 1879. Of the total for Ί875, 181,863 were Protestants, 76,891 Roman Catholics, and 4018 Jews. The chief town, Zwolle, had in 1879 a communal population of 22,759, and there were fourteen other communes with more than 2000 inhabitants, including Deventer, 19,162; Kämpen, 17,444; Almelo, 7758; Hengelo, 6502.

Both the present name Overyssel and the older designation Oversticht are explained by the fact that the province lies mainly on the other side of the Yssel from Utrecht, with which it long constituted an episcopal principality. Vollenhove was bestowed on the bishops in 943, Oldenzaal in 970, the land north-east of Vollenhove in Ï042, Deventer in 1046, a part of Salland in 1226, the countship of Goor in 1248, the lordship of Diepenheim in 1331, anl that of Almelo in 1406. In 1527 Bishop Henry of Bavaria a l vised the recognition of Charles V. as protector and ruler of the district, and Oversticht became Overyssel. It was the sixth province to join the Union in 1579. During the French occupation it bore the name of the department of Bouches de 1’Issel.
