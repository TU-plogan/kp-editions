OVAR, a town of Portugal, in the district of Aveiro (Beira), with a station on the railway 20 miles south of Oporto, lies at the northern end of the Aveiro lagoon, —an extremely unhealthy position. It contains 10,022 inhabitants (1878), and carries on a brisk trade with the colonies and northern Africa.
