ORYEKHOFF-ZUYEFF, or Oryekhovskiy Pogost, a village of European Russia, in the Pokroff district of the Vladimir government, 12 miles west of Pokroff by rail, on the Klyazma, a subtributary of the Volga. A great cotton factory in the vicinity has become the centre of a new town, which is called after the village, but also frequently Nikolskoye. About 12,600 hands are employed in the cotton manufacture itself, and about 6000 in digging peats and making bricks for the firm. There are forty-two steam engines (978 horse-power), and goods were manufactured to the value of 8,328,000 roubles in 1881 (2,590,000 in 1861). The cotton is procured from Asia and western Europe, and the goods are sold throughout southern and south-eastern Russia.
