OVATION, an honour awarded in Rome to victorious generals. It was less distinguished than the triumph (see Triumph), and was awarded either when the campaign, though victorious, had not been important enough for the higher honour, or when the general was not of rank sufficient to give him the right to a triumph. The ceremonial was on the whole similar in the two cases, but in an ovation the general walked or more commonly rode on horseback.
