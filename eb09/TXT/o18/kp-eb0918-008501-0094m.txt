OWEGO, a post village and township of the United States, capital of Tioga county, New York, lies at the mouth of Owego Creek, on the north side of the Susquehanna (here crossed by a bridge), 237 miles northwest of New York by the New York, Erie, and Western Railroad, which here connects with the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western and the Southern Central Railroads. The village, built at the foot of a considerable hill in the heart of a fine agricultural district, is a pleasant place with broad maple-shaded side-walks along its principal streets. Grist-mills, soap-works, marble-works, a piano factory, and carriage-works are among the industrial establishments. The population of the village was 4756 in 1870 and 5525 in 1880; that of the whole township 9442 and 9984 respectively.
