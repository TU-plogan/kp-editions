+====================================================================+


JAY, William (1769-1853), dissenting preacher and religious author, was born at Tisbury in Wiltshire on May 6, 1769. The son of a stone mason, he had adopted his father’s calling, when his appearance attracted the attention of the Rev. Cornelius Winter, the dissenting minister. Mr Winter at that time presided over a religious seminary at Marlborough, in which, with his advice and assistance, the young mason became a student in 1785. During the three years and a half that Jay spent at Marlborough, the wonderful preaching powers which distinguished him till the day of his death were rapidly developed. His first sermon was delivered in his seventeenth year; and before his majority he had preached nearly a thousand times. In 1788 he had even for a season occupied Rowland Hill’s pulpit in London. But his youth warned him to seek more time for study, and he therefore accepted the humble pastorate of Christian Malford, near Chippenham, where he remained about two years. He had hardly spent a year in his next charge at the Hot Wells, Clifton, when he was unanimously chosen to be minister of Argyle Independent Chapel in Bath; and on January 30, 1791, he entered the sphere in which he was to spend the rest of his active life, attracting to his chapel hearers of every religious denomination and of every social and literary rank, and winning for himself a wide and solid reputation as a brilliant pulpit orator, as an earnest religious author, and as a pious minister. In 1841 the jubilee of his pastorate was celebrated; in 1852 he was requested to retire; and the connexion of sixty-three years formally ended in January 1853. He died on December 27, 1853.

Asa preacher Jay was eloquent and impressive; but his expressions and style at times wanted refinement and delicacy. His sermons were often so practical and direct as to excite suspicion, though quite unfounded, of being aimed at individuals. He was fond of peculiar texts, and did not always restrain his sense of humour when in the pulpit. The popularity which his writings, especially his devotional writings, have found with a wide circle of readers vouches for their worth. In his books he is always earnest, homely, and practical, and at times attains a certain neatness of diction and aptness of illustration. Perhaps the best known of his works are his Morning and Evening Exercises; The Christian Contemplated; The Domestic Minister's Assistant ; and his Discourses. For his Short Discourses for the Use of Families the diploma of D.D. was conferred upon him by the college of New Jersey; but he did not avail himself of the title. Jay also wrote an excellent Life of Rev. Cornelius Winter, and Memoirs of Rev. John Clarke. An edition of Jay’s Works in 12 vols. 8vo, revised by himself, was issued in 1842-44; again, reduced in price, in 1856. A new edition, in 8 vols. 8vo, was announced in 1876. For further particulars see Jay’s Autobiography, 1854; Kev. S. Wilson’s Memoir of Jay, 1854; Wallace’s Portraiture of Jay, 1854; and Cyrus Jay’s Recollections of William Jay, 1859.
