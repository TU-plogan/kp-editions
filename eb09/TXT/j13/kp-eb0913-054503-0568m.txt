JÁJPUR, or Jajpore, a municipal town in Cuttack district, Bengal, is situated on the right bank of the Baitarâni river, in 20° 50' 45" N. lat., 86° 22' 56" E. long. It contains the usual subdivisional and public buildings, a charitable dispensary, a Government-aided school, &c. It was the capital of the province of Orissa under the Kesari dynasty until the 11th century, when it was superseded by Cuttack, the modern metropolis. Jâjpur is celebrated as a settlement of Brâhman Sivaite priests, and as the headquarters of one of the four regions of pilgrimage into which Orissa is divided, viz., that sacred to Parvati, the wife of the All-Destroyer. In Jâjpur are numerous ruins of Sivaite temples, sculptures, &c. In the 16th century this town was the scene of the struggle between Musalmàn and Hindu powers, from which it emerged in ruins. It, however, still ranks as the fourth town of Orissa, and derives much wealth from its yearly fair in honour of Baruni, “Queen of the Waters,” at which numbers of pilgrims assemble to bathe in the holy Baitarâni, the Styx of Hindu mythology. The population in 1872 numbered 10,753.
