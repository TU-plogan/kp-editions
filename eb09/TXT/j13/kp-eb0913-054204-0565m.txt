JAHN, Johann (1750-1816), a distinguished Orientalist and Biblical critic of the Roman Catholic Church, was born at Tasswitz, Moravia, on June 18, 1750. After completing his school education at Znaim he studied philosophy at Olmütz, andin 1772 began his theological studies at the Praemonstratensian convent of Bruck in the neighbourhood of Znaim. Having been ordained to the priesthood in 1775, he for a short time held a cure of souls at Mislitz, but was soon recalled to Bruck to become professor of Oriental languages and Biblical hermeneutics there. On the suppression of the convent by Joseph II. in 1784, Jahn was removed to a chair at Olmütz corresponding to that which he had previously held, and in 1789 he was transferred to Vienna as professor of Oriental languages, Biblical archaeology, and dogmatics. In 1792 he published his Einleitung ins Alte Testament (2 vols.), which almost [9:13:543] immediately began to cause him trouble; a certain Cardinal Migazzi laid a complaint against him before the emperor because in his preface he had confessed himself to have in some points departed from the views of his learned predecessors and adopted opinions of his own, while in the work itself he declared Job, Jonah, Tobit, and Judith to be didactic poems. To these charges was added a third, that in his New Testament lectures he had stated the cases of demoniacal possession there mentioned to be cases of natural disease. On the matter being referred to an ecclesiastical commission, it was reported that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical, but that Jahn had shown undue rashness in giving out, as his own, opinions which teachers of theology ought not to mention otherwise than as foreign; in accordance with this it was decided that he ought to modify his expressions in future editions of his work and in his subsequent lecturing. Although he appears honestly to have accepted this judgment, the hostility of those who were opposed to his teaching did not cease until at last (1806) he was compelled to accept a canonry at Vienna, which involved the resignation of his chair. This step had been preceded by the condemnation of his Introductio in libros sacros Veteris Foederis in compendium redacta, published in 1804, and also of his Archaeologia Biblica in compendium redacta (1805). The only work of importance, outside the region of mere philology, afterwards published by him, was the Enchiridion Hermeneuticae (1812). He died August 16, 1816. Jahn’s place in the history of the modern science of Biblical criticism is undoubtedly an honourable one, and also of some importance, especially when his ecclesiastical environment is taken into account. If he cannot be said to have been either very original or very profound, he has at least the merit of being laborious, candid, and clear-sighted within his range of vision; one of his books, the Archaeo- logia, is not even yet entirely superseded.

Besides the works already mentioned, he published Hebräische Sprachlehre fur Anfänger, 1792; Aramäische οd. Chaldäische u. Syrische Sprachlehre für Anfänger, 1793; Arabische Sprachlehre, 1796; Elementarbuch der Hebr. Sprache, 1799; Chaldäische Chrestomathie, 1800; Arabische Chrestomathie, 1802; Lexicon Arabico- Latinum Chrestomathiae accommodatum, 1802; an edition of the Hebrew Bible, 1806; Grammatica linguae Hebraicae, 1809; a critical commentary on the Messianic passages of the Old Testament ( Vaticinia prophetarum de Jesu Messia), 1815. In 1821 a collection of Nachträge appeared, containing six dissertations on Biblical subjects. The English translation of the Archaeologia by Upham has passed through several editions. See A. G. Hoffmann’s article in Erseh and Gruber’s Encyclopädie.
