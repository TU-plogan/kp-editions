JÁTS, an Indian people estimated to form two-fifths of the entire population of the Punjab and half that of the Râj put states. They are also widely spread through Sind, Baluchistan, and the North-Western Provinces. Their traditions indicate an immigration from Ghazni or Kandahar, but writers of authority have identified them with the ancient Getae,^[1. See article India, vol. xii. p. 789.] and there is strong reason to believe them a degraded tribe of Râjputs, whose Scythic origin has also been maintained. Dr Trumpp,^[2. Zeitschrift d. Deutsch. Mοrg. Gesellschaft, xv. p. 690, and “Die heutige Bevölkerung des Panjâb,” in Mitthedungen d. anthropol. Gesellsch. in Wien, 1872.] however, regards them as the first Aryan settlers in the valley of the Indus, and their language strongly favours this view. The Jâtaki, or Jât vernacular, retained by them with singular tenacity, is a variety of Sindhi, and a pure Sanskrit tongue, exhibiting unusually early grammatical forms. Hindu legends point to a prehistoric occupation of the Indus valley by this people, and at the time of the Mahometan conquest of Sind (712 a.d.) they, with a cognate tribe called Meds, constituted the bulk of the population. They enlisted under the banners of Mohammed Kâsim, but at a later date offered a vigorous resistance to the Arab invaders. In 836 they were overthrown by Amran, who imposed on them a tribute of dogs, and used their arms to vanquish the Meds. In 1025, however, they had gathered audacity, not only to invade Mansura, and compel the abjuration of the Mussulman emir, but to attack the victorious army of Mahmxid, laden with the spoil of Somnath. Chastisement duly ensued: a formidable flotilla, collected at Miïltân, shattered in thousands the comparatively defenceless Jât boats on the Indus, and annihilated their national pretensions. In recent times the valour of the race showed itself in the two sieges of Bhartpur, the seat of a Jât dynasty, in 1805 and 1826, and has long been conspicuous in the military qualities of the Sikhs. They are a migratory stock. We hear of early Jât settlements on the shores of the Persian Gulf; there was in the 9th century a Jât quarter in Antioch; and a colony established in the Chaldaean marshes defied during twenty-four years the power of the caliphs, and was finally vanquished and deported to the Cilician frontier in 834. The Jâts are now mainly agriculturists and cattle breeders, rearing with extraordinary skill and care large flocks of camels, in the Mekran and the desert tracts of Sind. In their settlements on the Gauges and Jumna, extending as far east as Bareilly, they are divided into two great clans, the Dhe and the Hele; while in the Punjab there are said to be one hundred different tribes. Their religion varies with locality. East of the Râvi they profess a modified Brahmanism, discarding the restrictions of caste; in the Punjab they have largely embraced Sikh tenets; while in Sind and Baluchistan they are Mahometans. They are in general a harmless, industrious people, preserving in songs and legends the memory of better times. Under favourable conditions, however, old predatory habits revive, and their wandering instinct leads them, in the guise of itinerant traders, far into Central Asia. Indeed, there is plausible though not conclusive evidence that the Gipsies owned them as progenitors.^[3. See Gipsies, vol. x. p. 617; also Edinburgh Review, No. 303. p. 131.] In appearance they are not ill-favoured, though extremely dark; they have good teeth, and large beards, sometimes stained with indigo. Their inferiority of social position, however, to some extent betrays itself in their aspect, and tends to be perpetuated by their intellectual apathy.
