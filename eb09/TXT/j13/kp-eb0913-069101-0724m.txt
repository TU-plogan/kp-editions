JHIND, or Jind, a native state in the Punjab, India, consisting of three or four isolated tracts to the east of the Sutlej. The area is 1236 square miles, and the estimated population 311,000. The principality was founded in 1763 by a Sikh of the Sidhu Jät tribe, and the chief was recognized as râjA by the Mughal emperor in 1768. The family have always been loyal supporters of the British Government. On the overthrow of the Marhattâ power in northern India in 1804—5, the Jhind râjâ was among the foremost to tender his allegiance to Lord Lake, who confirmed him in the possession of the estates he had held under the Mughal emperors and the Marhattâs. After the Sutlej campaign a further grant of land was awarded the chief in recognition of his services. In 1857 Râjâ. Swarûp Sinh of Jhind was the first to march against the mutineers at Delhi. His troops acted as the vanguard of the army, and he himself remained in the British camp until the reoccupation of the city, a portion of his soldiers aiding in the assault. For these services he received a grant of additional territory, yielding £11,681 per annum. The ràjâ enjoys an estimated revenue of between £60,000 and £70,000, and maintains a force of 10 guns, 79 artillerymen, 200 cavalry, and 1600 infantry. No tribute is paid by the state, but a contingent of twenty-five horsemen is furnished to the British Government.
