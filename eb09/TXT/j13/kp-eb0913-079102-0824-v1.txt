JUSTIN I., the elder, Roman emperor of the East from 518 to 527, was originally a Dacian peasant; but, enlisting under Leo I. he rose by his size and strength to be commander of the imperial guards of Anastasius. On the death of that emperor in 518, the wily Dacian, aged sixty-eight, used for his own election to the throne a sum of money that he had received for the support of another candidate. Though ignorant even of the rudiments of letters, Justin was sufficiently acute, and he was sensible enough to entrust the administration of state to his wise and faithful quaestor Proclus, though his own experience dictated several improvements in military affairs. An orthodox churchman himself, he effected in 519 a reconciliation of the Eastern and Western Churches, after a schism of thirty-five years (see Hormisdas). The assassination of the orthodox general Vitalian, and the virulence of the bloody conflicts of the “blue” and “green” factions that convulsed the capital towards the end of Justin’s reign, [9:13:792] are attributed to the jealousy and intrigues of the emperor’s nephew and successor Justinian. In 522 a war broke out with Persia, in which Belisarius made his first historical appearance; it continued for some years without any definite results. In 522 also Justin ceded to Theodoric, the Gothic king of Italy, the right of naming the consuls, and in 525 he received from that Arian monarch a deputation, of which the pope, John I., was compelled to be the leader, to deprecate an edict issued by Justin in 523 against all heretics. On April 1, 527, Justin, at the request of the senate, assumed Justinian as his colleague, and on the 1st of the following August he died. Justin bestowed much care on the repairing of public buildings throughout his empire, and contributed large sums to repair the damage caused by a destructive earthquake at Antioch.
