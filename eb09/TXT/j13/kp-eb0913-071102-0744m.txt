JOHN XIII. (pope from 965 to 972) was descended from a noble Roman family, and at the time of his election as successor to Leo VIII. was bishop of Narni. He had been somewhat inconsistent in his relations with his predecessor Leo, but his election was confirmed by the emperor Otho, and his submissive attitude towards the imperial power was so distasteful to the Romans that they expelled him from the city. On account of the threatening procedure of Otho, they permitted him shortly afterwards to return, upon which, with the sanction of Otho, he took savage vengeance on those who had formerly opposed him. Shortly after holding a council along with the emperor at Ravenna in 967, he gave the imperial crown to Otho II. at Rome in assurance of his succession to his father; and in 972 he also crowned Theophania as empress immediately before her marriage. On his death in the same year, he was followed by Benedict VI.
