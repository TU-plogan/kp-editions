JUNIUS, Franciscus (1589-1677), son of the foregoing, was born at Heidelberg in 1589. Brought up at Leyden, his attention was diverted from military to theological studies by the peace of 1609 between Spain and the Netherlands. In 1620 he went to England, where he became librarian to the earl of Arundel, and remained thirty years. He devoted himself to the study of Anglo-Saxon, and afterwards of the cognate old Teutonic languages,—a branch of study in which he has high claims to honour, not only from his own valuable labours in a hitherto almost completely neglected field, but also from having directed the scholarly attention of others to it. In 1650 Junius returned to Holland, where he continued to study as zealously as ever. For two years he lived .in Friesland in order to study the peculiar old dialect. In 1675 he returned to England; in 1677 he went to live at Windsor with his nephew, Isaac Vossius, in whose house he died, November 19, 1677.

The uneventful life of Junius was eminently the life of a student; fourteen hours a day were spent at his desk; and the results are seen in his books, and in the rich collection of ancient MSS., edited and annotated by him, which he bequeathed to the university of Oxford. Junius published De Pictura Veterum, 1637 (in English by the author, 1638; enlarged and improved edition, edited by Graevius, who prefixed a life of Junius, and with a catalogue of architects, painters, &c., and their works, Rotterdam, 1694); Observationes in Willerami Abbatis Francicam Paraphrasin Cantici Canticorum, Amst., 1655; Annotationes in Harmoniam Latino-Francicam quatuor Evangelistarum, Latine a Tatiano confectam, Amst., 1655; Caedmonis Paraphrasis Poetica Geneseos, Amst., 1655; Quatuor I). N. J. C. Euangeliorum Versiones Pcrantiquae Duae, Gothica scilicet et Anglo- Saxonica, Dort, 2 vols., 1665 (the Gothic version in this book Junius transcribed from the Silver Codex of Ulfilas; the Anglo-Saxon version is from an edition by Thomas Marshall, whose notes to both versions are given, and a Gothic glossary by Junius); Etymologictcm Anglicanum, edited by Edmund Lye, and preceded by a life of Junius and Hickes’s Anglo-Saxon grammar, Oxford, 1743. Graevius gives a list of the MSS. presented by Junius to Oxford; the most important are a version of the 0rmulurn, the version of Caedmon, and 9 volumes containing Glossarium V. Linguarum Septentrionalium.
