JUNOT, Andoche (1771-1813), Duc d’Abrantès, was bornât Bussy-Ie-Grand, 23d October 1771. He went to school at Chatillon, and was known among his comrades as a blustering but loveable creature, with a pugnacious disposition. He came under the special notice of Napoleon during the siege of Toulon, while serving as his secretary. It is related that as he was taking down a despatch, a shell bursting hard by and covering the paper with sand, he exclaimed “Bien! nous n’ avions pas de sable pour sécher Γencre! en voici !” He accompanied Napoleon to Italy in the capacity of aide-de-camp, and distinguished himself so much at the battle of Millesimo that he was selected to carry back the captured colours to Paris. Returning to Italy he went through the campaign with honour, but was badly wounded in the head at Lonato. From the effects of the wound he never completely recovered, and many rash incidents in his career may be directly traced to it. During the expedition to Egypt he acted as general of brigade, and went through fourteen brilliant hours of fighting at Nazareth, putting 10,000 Turks to flight with 3Ö0 troopers. His devotion to Napoleon involved him in a duel with General Lanusse, in which he was again wounded. He had to be left in Egypt to recover, and in crossing to France was captured by English cruisers. On his return to France he was made commandant of Paris, and afterwards promoted general of division. He next served at Arras in command of the grenadiers of the army destined for the invasion of England, and made some alterations in the equipment of the troops which received the praise of the emperor. It was, however, a bitter mortification that he was not appointed a marshal of France when he received the cross of the legion of honour. He was sent to Lisbon instead, his entry into which city was something like a royal progress, though his vanity was disappointed by the mission. He was so restless and dissatisfied in the Portuguese capital that he set out, without leave, for the army of Napoleon, and at Austerlitz behaved with conspicuous courage and zeal. But he soon offended the emperor by his manner and his demands, and was sent to Parma to put down an insurrection and to be out of the way. In 1806 he was recalled and became governor of Paris. His extravagance and prodigality shocked the Government, and some rumours of an intrigue with Joséphine made it desirable again to send him away. He was, therefore, appointed to lead an invading force into Portugal. For the first time Junot had a great task to perform, and only his own resources to fall back upon for its achievement. Early in November 1807 he set out from Salamanca, crossed the mountains of Beira, rallied his broken forces at Abrantès, and, with 1500 men, dashed upon Lisbon. The whole movement only took a month; he was then invested with the governorship. Administration was his weak point, and in a short time, instead of consolidating the results of his victory, he had squandered them by a course of conduct like that of an Eastern monarch. After Wellesley encountered him at Vimiera he was obliged to withdraw from Portugal with all his forces. Napoleon disapproved, but sent him back to Spain, where, acting under Massena, he was once more seriously wounded. His last campaign was made in Russia, and he got more than a just share of the discredit which attached to it. Napoleon next appointed him to govern Illyria. On the 29th July 1813 he threw himself from a window at Montbard, in a fit of insanity.
