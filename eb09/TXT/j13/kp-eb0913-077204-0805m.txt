JUMIÉGES, or Jumiéges, a village of France, in the department of Seine Inférieure and arrondissement of Rouen, about 16 miles south-west of Rouen, in one of the peninsulas formed by the winding of the Seine. The population was less than 2000 in 1876; but the place is famous for the imposing ruins of the abbey of Jumiéges (Latinized as Gemeticum, G emedium, Gimegiae, Jumedica, &c.), one of the great establishments of the Benedictine order. The principal remains are those of the Church of the Virgin, which had a central tower, the magnitude of which may be judged by one of the sustaining arches still extant. Among the minor relics are the stone which once covered the grave of Agnes Sorel, and two recumbent statues of the 13th century, popularly known as the Énerves, and explained by a baseless legend which makes them represent two sons of Clovis II., who were punished for revolt against their father by having the tendons of their arms and legs cut through, and being set adrift in a boat on the Seine.

The foundation of the abbey of Jumiéges is generally assigned to St Philbert, 664 A.D., whose name is still to be read on gold and silver coins obtained from the site. It was to Jumiéges that abbot Sturm of Fulda was relegated (760-62), and thither it was that Charlemagne sent Thassilo, the captive duke of Bavaria, and his son Theodo. The 9th century was a period of pillage and disaster for the abbey, but the 11th and 12th centuries saw it raised to new splendour and greatness. One of its monks, Robert Champart, became, under Edward the Confessor, bishop of London and archbishop of Canterbury. Returning to die in his abbey (1052), he brought with him an Anglo-Saxon missal and pontifical, which are still preserved in the public library of Rouen.
