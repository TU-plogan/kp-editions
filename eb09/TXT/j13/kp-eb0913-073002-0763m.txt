JOHNSTON, Alexander Keith (1804-1871), geographer, was born at Kirkhill near Edinburgh, in December 1804. After an education at the High School of Edinburgh he was apprenticed to an engraver; and about 1830 he joined his brother in a prosperous printing and engraving business. His passion for geography had early developed itself, but his first important work was the National Atlas of general geography, which gained for him in 1843 the appointment of geographer-royal for Scotland. Johnston was the first to bring the study of physical geography into competent notice in England. His attention had been called to the subject by Humboldt; and after years of labour he published his magnificent Physical Atlas in 1848, followed by a second and enlarged edition in 1856. This, by means of maps with descriptive letterpress, illustrates the geology, hydrography, meteorology, botany, zoology, and ethnology of the globe, and undoubtedly marks an epoch in the history of English geographical science. The rest of Johnston’s life was equally given to geography, his later years to its educational aspects especially. His services were recognized by election to fellowships of the leading scientific societies of Europe, India, and America. For his chart of the geographical distribution of health and disease he received the diploma of the London Epidemiological Society; in 1865 he received the degree of LL.D, from Edinburgh University; and in 1871 the Royal Geographical Society awarded him its Victoria medal. He died July 9, 1871. His son of the same name (1844-1879) was also the author of various geographical works and papers.

Johnston published a Dictionary of Geography in 1850, with many later editions; The Royal Atlas of Modem Geography, begun in 1855; an atlas of military geography to accompany Alison’s History of Europe’, and a variety of other atlases and maps for educational or scientific purposes.
