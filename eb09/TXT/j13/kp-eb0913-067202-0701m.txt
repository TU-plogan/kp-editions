JET, a mineral substance belonging to the carbonaceous group, and generally regarded as a compact variety of lignite, or wood-coal, impregnated with bitumen. The word jet (German Gagat) is corrupted from gagates, the name applied to it, or to a similar substance, by Greek and Roman writers, and derived, according to Pliny (H. A r ., xxxvi. 34∖ from the river Gagas in Lycia, where the mineral was originally found. Its occurrence in Britain is [9:13:673] mentioned by Solinus; but it was certainly used there in pre-Roman times. Barrows of the Bronze Age have yielded beads, buttons, rings, armlets, and other personal ornaments of jet. The early supply was probably obtained from the Yorkshire coast, near Whitby—a locality which still yields the finest varieties. The Whitby jet occurs in isolated masses, of irregular shape, but frequently more or less lenticular, imbedded in bituminous shales near the base of the Upper Lias. The particular horizon of the jet-rock is known to geologists as the zone of Ammonites serpentinus. Opinion is divided as to the exact nature and origin of the jet: some regard it as a variety of lignite, others as a kind of cannel coal, and others again as a hardened form of bitumen. There is little doubt that the jet has in all cases resulted from the decay of organic matter. Microscopic sections of jet frequently reveal a ligneous structure, in most cases of coniferous type. It has been suggested that masses of wood brought down by a river have drifted out to sea, where, becoming water-logged, they have sunk and have gradually been covered with a deposit of fine black mud, beneath which the decay has slowly proceeded! Possibly bituminous matter may have been distilled from this decaying vegetation, and deposited between the layers of shale in its neighbourhood. Drops of liquid bitumen are frequently found in the fossils of the jet-rock, and inflammable gas, derived from the bituminous shales, is not uncommon in the jet-mines. Moreover, scales of fish and other fossils of the jet-rock are frequently converted into jet, the bituminous matter having replaced the original tissues. When jet is heated, it betrays its bituminous character by burning with a dense pungent smoke, which was formerly reputed to possess powerful medicinal virtues. At present the material is used only for trivial ornaments, principally for mourning jewellery. To obtain jet, the shale is systematically mined not only at its outcrop in the cliffs but in the inland dales of the Cleveland district. It is now rare to find washed jet upon the sea-shore, but formerly a considerable quantity was thus obtained. The best hard jet is exceedingly tough, and may be readily carved or turned on the lathe, while its compact texture allows it to receive a high polish. The final polish is given by means of rouge, which produces a beautiful velvety surface. The softer kinds, not capable of being freely worked, are known as bastard jet. From the estuarine beds of the Lower Oolites of Yorkshire, a soft jet is obtained; but, though occasionally used for ornamental purposes, it is far inferior to the true Whitby jet. Spanish jet has been largely imported into Whitby, but is deficient in hardness and lustre. Cannel coal from Scotland is occasionally used in the place of jet; and it is not uncommon for brooches to be made of a carving of Whitby jet set in a plain polished rim of either Spanish jet or cannel
