+=====================================================================+


JONES, John Paul (1747-1792), was born July 6, 1747, on the estate of Arbigland, in the parish of Kirkbean and the stewartry of Kirkcudbright, Scotland, where his father, John Paul, was gardener. At twelve he went to sea as apprentice to a merchant of Whitehaven, in whose ships he visited America several times. He became a skilful sailor, and was for some time mate of a slaver in the West Indies. On his way back to England, after leaving the slave trade in disgust, the captain and mate of the ship in which he was both died; and the skilful manner in which Paul Jones brought the ship safely into port induced the owners to appoint him captain. In 1773, having for some unknown reason assumed the cognomen Jones, he settled in Virginia, on a property which had fallen to him on the death of an older brother. When the American war of independence broke out two years later, Jones took up arms for the colonies, and accepted a command in the navy of the new republic. He did good service against his native land, and in 1777 was sent to France to receive a more important command. Disappointed in that, he sailed in 1778 to the English coast in his ship “Ranger,” and availed himself of his early knowledge to land at Whitehaven, where, however, he was unsuccessful in his attempt to fire the shipping. Next year he sailed on a similar expedition in the “Bonhomme Richard,” along with other vessels, and, steering up the Firth of Forth, was only prevented by a strong westerly gale from attacking Leith. On his way south again he fell in, off Flamborough Head, with the English ship “Serapis,” which after a long and bloody combat he compelled to strike. That exploit raised his fame to its acme. On his return to Paris he was fêted and caressed by the best society; and Louis XVI. presented him with a gold-hilted sword, and decorated him with the military Order of Merit. After some time spent in America, where he was much chagrined by the neglect that met his boastful requests for further employment, Paul Jones returned to Paris as agent for all prizes taken in Europe under his own command. While he resumed his efforts to pose as a man of ton, he attended carefully to his duties. A favourable report to Congress as to his naval services was followed by a vote of a gold medal from that body in 1786. In 1788 the Chevalier Jones entered the service of the empress Catherine of Russia, and became as enthusiastic a Russian as he had been an American. He was appointed to a command in the Black Sea, with the rank of rear-admiral, to act against the Turks; but the jealousy and rivalry of the Russian commanders brought about his recall in less than eight months. Summoned to St Petersburg, on pretext of [9:13:739] receiving a post in the North Sea, he was left in restless idleness, until at last two years’ formal leave of absence was granted him. On this virtual dismissal, Paul Jones retired to Paris, soured and disappointed; and after two years spent in fruitlessly importuning the Russian court, he died in that city ofi July 18, 1792.

Paul Jones is described as a “short, thick, little fellow, about 5 feet 8 inches in height, of a dark swarthy complexion.” Naval skill and bravery he certainly had, but his letters prove him to have been boastful and quarrelsome. He writhed under the suspicion of being an “adventurer once and again he eagerly repels the charge. English contemporary accounts generally speak of him as a pirate; and, though he certainly ranked as an officer of the United States, the independent manner in which he cruised might well suggest letters of marque rather than a Government commission.

The life of Paul Jones has given rise to much romance. Cooper, Dumas, and Allan Cunningham have celebrated him in their novels; and scarcely less fictitious are some of his so-called biographies. The most authentic seems to be the Memoirs of Paid Jones, 2 vols., Edinburgh, 1830.
