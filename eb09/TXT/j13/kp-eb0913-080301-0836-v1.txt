JÜTERBOGK, Jüterbog, or Jüterbock, the chief town of the circle Jüterbogk-Luckenwalde, in the government district of Potsdam and province of Brandenburg, Prussia, is situated on the Nuthe, 39 miles south-west of Berlin, with which it is connected by rail. It contains four Protestant churches, of which that of St Nicholas, dating from the close of the 14th century. Jüterbogk carries on weaving and spinning both of flax and wool, apd trades in the produce of those manufactures and in cattle. Vines are cultivated in the neighbourhood. Jüterbogk appears in history as the scene of religious discussions in 1548 and 1575, of a treaty between Brandenburg and Saxony in 1611, and of the victory of the Swedes under Torstenson over the imperial troops under Gallas in 1644. Two miles south-west is the battlefield of Dennewitz, where Bülow defeated Ney and Oudinot, September 6, 1813. The population, including the garrison, was 6852 in 1875; with the immediately adjacent villages of Damm and Neumarkt it was 8427.
