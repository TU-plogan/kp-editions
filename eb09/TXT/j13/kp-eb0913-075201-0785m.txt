JOSHUA (^∏ζ or in later Heb. W⅛., Gr. Ι ψ ro⅛, whence “Jesus” in the A. V. of Heb. iv. 8; another form of the name is Hoshea, Num. xiii. 8, 16), first the lieutenant and afterwards the successor of Moses, was the son of Nun, of the tribe of Ephraim, and left Egypt, along with the rest of the children of Israel, at the time of the exodus. In the Pentateuch he is first mentioned as being the victorious commander of the Israelites in their battle against the Amalekites at Rephidim (Ex. xvii. 9-13), and he is represented as having earned further distinction along with Caleb by his calm and courageous demeanour in the midst of the popular tumult [9:13:753] caused by the report of the spies (Num. xiv. 6-9, 38). On the death of Moses he assumed the leadership to which he had previously been designated by his chief, and the book known by his name is entirely occupied with details of the manner in which he carried out the task thus laid to his hand,—that of taking possession of the land of Canaan. On the completion of the reconnaissance by the two spies, he left Shittim with his army, preceded by the priest-borne ark of the covenant. The Jordan having been miraculously crossed, his first encampment was at Gilgal. Jericho and Ai soon fell into his hands, and the people of Gibeon became vassals. In the neighbourhood of Gibeon the five kings of the Amorites were crushed in a decisive battle in which the very elements conspired to favour the invader, and (to use the poetical language of the book of Jashar) “the sun stood still and the moon stayed until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies.” The victorious arms of Israel were now directed northwards against a league of Canaanite potentates under the hegemony of Jabin, king of Hazor; anticipating the attack of the enemy, Joshua surprised and crushed them at the waters of Merom, Hazor itself being taken and burnt. Thus far the first twelve chapters of the book of Joshua; the remaining twelve describe the partition of the (conquered and unconquered) country among the twelve tribes, and conclude with a resumé of his parting exhortations. At the age of one hundred and ten he died and was buried in this inheritance in Timnath-serah, in the territory of Ephraim. For the book of Joshua, an integral part of that part of the Old Testament sometimes spoken of as Hexateuch, the reader is referred to the heading Pentateuch.

Critical investigation has shown that the history or Joshua as now sketched is a composite narrative, made up mainly from the two Elohistic (or, as they are now generally called, the Elohistic and the Levitical) documents. Fragments of an account of the conquest of Canaan older than either of these writings are preserved in the book of Judges, and it is generally recognized by recent inquirers that the progress of the Israelites was much slower and their action less united than appears on the face of the book of Joshua as we now read it, the statistics of the Levitical record in particular applying properly to a much later date. From this point of view Joshua appears rather as the leader of Ephraim than of all Israel. He is for the north what Caleb was for the south. See Israel and Judges, and compare a paper by Meyer in Stade’s Zeitsch. f. ATliche Wiss., vol. i. (1881). See also Ewald, Geschichte, vol. ii. The only extra-Biblical notice of Joshua is the inscription of more than doubtful genuineness given by Procopius (Vand. , ii. 20), and mentioned also by Moses of Chorene [Hist. Arm., i. 18). It is said to have stood at Tingis in Mauretania, and to have borne that those who erected it had fled before 'kησoυs ύ Kτ ∣ στi]s.
