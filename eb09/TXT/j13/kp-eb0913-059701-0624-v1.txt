JÁSZ-BERÉNY, a corporate town of Hungary, and formerly capital of the Jâszsâg (Jazygia) district (since 1876 incorporated with the Cis-Tisian county of Jâsz-Nagy-Kun-Szolnok), is pleasantly situated on both banks of the Zagyva, crossed there by a stone bridge, and on the, Hatvan-Szolnok line of railway, 39 miles east of Budapest, 47° 29' N. lat., 19° 57' E. long. It is the seat of a royal court of law and a circuit court, and has several churches, one of which is large and handsome, a Franciscan monastery, a Roman Catholic gymnasium, a high school, a guard house, and an elegant town-hall, in which are preserved archives of considerable importance. In the centre of the town the channels of the Zagyva form two islands, which are planted with trees and laid out as promenades. On one of these stands a marble bust erected (1797) in honour of the Palatine Archduke Joseph. Not far from the same place are the ruins of a fortress, where it is popularly believed that Attila, king of the Huns, was buried (453). The inhabitants of the town and neighbourhood are much engaged in agricultural pursuits and in pasturing horses, cattle, and sheep on the vast communal lands. Fairs are periodically held in the town, and the trade in field produce, fruit, grain, and cattle is generally brisk. The population at the end of 1880 amounted to 21,781, chiefly Magyars by nationality, and Roman Catholics by creed.
