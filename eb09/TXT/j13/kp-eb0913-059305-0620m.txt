JARRAH WOOD is the product of a large tree {Eucalyptus marginata) found in western Australia, where it is said to be very abundant. The trees grow straight in the stem to a great size, and yield squared timber up to 40 feet in length and 24 inches in diameter. The wood is very hard, heavy (sp. gr. 1010), and close-grained, with a mahogany-red colour, and sometimes sufficient “figure” to render it suitable for cabinetmakers’ use. The timber possesses several useful characteristics; and great expectations have been formed as to its value for shipbuilding and general constructive purposes. These expectations have not, however, been realized, and the exclusive possession of the tree has not proved that source of wealth to western Australia which was at one time expected. Its greatest merit for shipbuilding and marine purposes is due to the fact that it resists, better than any other timber, the attacks of the Teredo navalis and other marine borers, and on land it is equally exempt, in tropical countries, from the ravages of white ants. When felled with the sap at its lowest point and well seasoned, the wood stands exposure in the air, earth, or sea remarkably well, on which account it is in request for railway sleepers, telegraph poles, and piles in the British colonies and India. The wood, however, frequently shows longitudinal blisters, or lacunae, filled with resin, the same as may be observed in spruce fir timber; and it is deficient in fibre, breaking with a short fracture under comparatively moderate pressure. It has been classed at Lloyd’s for shipbuilding purposes in line three, table A, of the registry rules.
