JANGIPUR, or Jahângîrpur, the chief town of the subdivision of the same name, in Murshidâbâd district, Bengal, situated on the left bank of the Bhâgirathï, in 24° 28' N. lat. and 88° 6' 45" E. long. The town is said to have derived its name from having been founded by the Mughal emperor Jahângir. During the early years of British rule it was an important centre of the silk trade, and the site of one of the Company’s commercial residences. Jangipur is best known as the toll station for registering all the traffic on the Bhâgirathï. The number of boats registered there annually is about 10,000; the amount of toll is £8000, or about one-third of the total gross revenue derived from the Nadiyâ rivers. The population in 1872 was 11,361.
