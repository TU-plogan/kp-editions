JERICHO (i∏'Ι', i∏T, “fragrant,” or perhaps, 'according to an old interpretation, “city of the moon”) was the first city west of the Jordan occupied by the Israelites. The city was destroyed, and, though it is mentioned from time to time under its usual name (2 Sam. x. 5) or by its epithet “city of palm trees” (Judg. i. 16, iii. 13; comp. Deut, xxxiv. 3), it was not rebuilt as a fortified place till the reign of Ahab (1 Kings xvi. 34), when it became the seat of a prophetical society, and appears in the history of the prophet Elisha (2 Kings ii.). The narrative of the healing of the waters by Elisha is referred by Josephus {Β. J. iv. 8, 3) to the copious fountain now called the Sultan’s Spring, which lies ori the western margin of the Jordan valley, 700 feet below the Mediterranean level, and just under the cliffs of M. Quarantania. The mounds surrounding the spring are of sun-dried brick, and show no traces of ancient building. The position of the town, in a district of great fertility, with rose gardens (Eccles, xxiv. 14), various species of date palms, and valuable cultivation of henna, opobalsamum, and myrobalan (Jos., ut supra-, Strabo, xvi. 2), secured its prosperity, while its situation at the gate of the great pass leading up from the Jordan valley to Jerusalem gave it strategical importance. Thus we find that it shared the calamities of the Babylonian exile (Ezra ii. 34), was reoccupied on the restoration (Neh. iii. 2), and was fortified by Bacchides in the Maccabee wars (1 Mac. ix. 50). In the time of Strabo there were two forts, Threx and Taurus, protecting the pass above Jericho. Antony gave the groves of Jericho as a rich gift to Cleopatra. From her they passed to Herod the Great, who made the city his winter residence, and adorned it with buildings, crowning the height above with a fortress named after his mother Cyprus. Here it was that the tyrant died. It appears, however, that the Jericho of Herod was not on the site of the old city (Jos., ut supra) but a mile to the south, where there are also mounds and the remains of five aqueducts conveying water from three distant springs. A great tank, of which the ruins are still traced, has been conjectured to be the same in which Herod drowned Aristobulus (Jos., Ant., xv. 2, 3). In the time of Christ the pilgrims from Peraea and Galilee appear to have gathered at Jericho on their way to Jerusalem, and so the town is repeatedly mentioned in the Gospels. According to Eusebius {Onom., ed. Lagarde, p. 265) Jericho was destroyed at the time of the fall of Jerusalem, and a new town sprang up, from which he distinguishes the ruins of two earlier cities as still visible. To the third Jericho, which was an episcopal city, may be referred the Byzantine remains immediately east of Tell es Sultân. The present village of Rîhâ or Arîhâ, which stands nearly half an hour south-east of the Sultan’s Spring, is a still more modern site, with a square tower of crusading date. Yâkùt, in the beginning of the 13th century, still speaks of Jericho as producing dates, bananas, and excellent sugar, but all these have disappeared with the gradual decay of [9:13:630] the place. The modern village is but a group of squalid huts, and the ancient groves are represented by a thicket of the Spina Christi and other trees between the village and the Sultan’s Spring.
