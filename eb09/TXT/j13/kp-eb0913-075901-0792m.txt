JUBA I., successor to his father Hiempsal on the throne of Numidia, owes his importance much more to the distracted state of the Roman world during the struggle betwixt Caesar and Pompey than to his intrinsic merit. He embraced Pompey’s cause, moved by ancient hereditary friendship to that general, as well as by personal enmity to Caesar, who had insulted him at Rome a few years before, and to Curio, Caesar’s general in Africa, who had openly proposed when tribune of the plebs in 50 b.c. that Numidia should be sold to colonists, and the king reduced to a private station. In 49 b.c. Juba marched against Curio, who was threatening Utica, and by a stratagem inflicted on the Caesarean army a crushing defeat, in which Curio was slain. Juba’s attention was momentarily distracted by a counter invasion of his territories by Bocchus and Sitius; but, finding that his lieutenant Saburra was able to defend his interests, he rejoined Scipio with a large body of troops. With Scipio he shared the defeat at Thapsus. Fleeing from the field with the Roman general Petrei us, the king wandered about for some time as a fugitive, spurned even from the gates of his own city Zama, where he had prepared for a desperate siege. The fugitives at length resolved to die by mutual slaughter. Juba killed Petreius, and sought the aid of a slave in despatching himself (46 b.c.). Juba’s character may be summed up in the word savage; he was brave, treacherous, insolent, and cruel.
