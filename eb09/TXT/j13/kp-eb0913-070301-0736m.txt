JOB’S TEARS. The seeds, or properly fruits of Job’s tears, Coije lachryma, Willd., a species of grass, are contained singly in a stony involucre or bract, which does not open until the enclosed seed germinates. The young involucre surrounds the female flower and the stalk supporting the spike of male flowers, and when ripe has the appearance of bluish white porcelain. Being shaped somewhat like a large drop of fluid, the form has suggested the name Job’s tears, or Lachryma J obi, under which the plant has been long known. The seeds are esculent, but the involucres are the part chiefly used, for making necklaces and other ornaments. The plant is a native of the East Indies, and was cultivated by Gerard as a tender annual.
