JOSEPH, the most powerful tribe of northern Israel, occupied the centre of the land from the plain of Esdraelon to the mountain country of Benjamin and threw out colonies to Bashan and northern Gilead (see Israel, p. 397). Unlike the other sons of Jacob, Joseph is usually reckoned as two tribes, the younger but more numerous tribe of Ephraim, to which Joshua belonged, having the preeminence over the other—Manasseh. In Ephraim lay the city of Shechem with the tomb of the tribal ancestor, and the great sanctuary of Shiloh where the ark stood till the battle of Ebenezer destroyed for a time the hegemony of Joseph, till after the division of the kingdoms he again became “the crowned one of his brethren” (Gen. xlix. 26; Deut, xxxiii. 16). Along with the small tribe of Benjamin, which as its name indicates lay immediately to the south, the house of Joseph constituted the group known as sons of Rachel (the ewe), which with the sons of Leah (the antelope) claimed a higher ancestry than the other Hebrews (the sons of Jacob’s concubines).

The name of Joseph, the tribal ancestor, is explained in Gen. XXX. 24, in accordance with the usual spelling f lPV, as meaning “he addeth” (hence in Ps. lxxxi. 6 [E. V. 5] the resolved form p ∣D1 ∏',). Another hand in Gen. xxx. 23 takes the word from f ]P⅛, “he taketh away.” The history of Joseph, Gen. xxxvii.-l., belongs almost wholly to the earliest strata of the Pentateuch, the narratives of the Jehovist and non-Levitical Elohist, the larger share belonging to the latter author, himself probably a member of the house of Joseph.

The history of Joseph in Egypt displays remarkable familiarity with the circumstances and usages of that country (see Ebers, Aegypten und die Bucher Mosis, Leipsic, 1868), but presents no data which enable us with certainty to combine the Biblical record with known events in Egyptian history. It isstill disputed whether Joseph came to Egypt before, under, or after the Hyksos. The first opinion, which is supported by Bunsen and others, involves a considerable reduction in the period of five hundred and eleven years assigned to the Hyksos by Manetho, while on the other hand a date subsequent to the expulsion of the Semitic invaders (e.g., under Sethi I. as Lepsius suggests) demands a great shortening of the four hundred and thirty years of Exod. xii. 40, if the Pharaoh of the oppression was Sethi’s successor, Rameses II. That the Israelites entered Egypt under the Hyksos is already mentioned as the current opinion of his time by George Syncellus, and is followed by many moderns, who observe that the promotion of a Hebrew appears most natural under a Semitic dynasty. See Egypt, vol. vii. p. 741, and for Brugsch’s supposed monumental reference to the seven years’ famine, ibid., p. 736. The Egyptian tale of “The Two Brothers,” which presents a remarkable parallel to the stoιy of Joseph, is given in Records of the Past, vol. ii.

The name of Joseph was common among the later Jews; of the Biblical personages by whom it was borne the best known are Joseph the husband of Mary, Joseph of Arimathaea, Joseph Barnabas, and Joseph Barsabas.
