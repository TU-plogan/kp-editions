JASON, grandson of the god Poseidon or of the king Cretheus, is by this descent as by his name (Ίάσων, *Iασoς, ’ Iασiωv, &c., can hardly be separated from Ίάς,Ίαστι, Ιaoveς &c., see Curt., Gr. Gesch., i., note 34) connected with the seafaring Ionians and their Poseidon religion. He was the leader of the Argonautic expedition, for the details of which see Argonauts. After he returned from it he lived at Corinth with his wife Medea for many years. At last he put away Medea, in order to marry Glauce, daughter of the Corinthian king Creon. The revenge which Medea took on Jason’s new wife and on her own children by him, is the subject of Euripides’s greatest play. The story of Jason is one of the most famous in Greek mythology, and has run through a long course of development. Stripping off the later embellishments of poetic fancy, we find that the main outlines were not completed till the voyages of the Euboean mariners to the Hellespont and the Euxine determined the order of the incidents of the outward voyage. Beneath this outward form we find that the scenes of Jason’s life are the places where Ionian mariners exerted most influence—the coasts of Thessaly and Boeotia, the Aegean islands, Corinth, and the Adriatic shores; moreover, the Minyae, who supplied most of the Argo’s crew, are closely connected with the old Ionians. The myth therefore was an accompaniment of the religion carried with them by these mariners, and preserves to us the memory of a genuine connexion once existing between these widely separate places. We can analyse the legend still further, determining the religious centre round which this historical framework has been constructed; this we shall find to be one of the commonest naturalistic myths. The sun, the ram with the golden fleece, flies through the air to the land at once of setting and of rising sun; there he is sacrificed on the shore in the fire of sunset; his skin is hung upon the tree of the nightly heaven, and guarded by the envious power, the dragon, till it is captured by the solar hero, by whom the darkness is dispelled and the dragon slain.
