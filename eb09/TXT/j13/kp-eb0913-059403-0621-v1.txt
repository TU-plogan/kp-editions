JASMIN, Jacques (1798-1864), a noted Gascon poet, was born at Agen, March 6, 1798. His childhood was spent in the midst of privations and all the straits of poverty, and he boasted in after .life that he had succeeded in breaking up the traditional chair in which the Jasmins had hitherto been carried to the workhouse in sickness and old age. His father, who was a tailor, had a certain facility for making doggrel verses, which he sang or recited at* -fairs and such like popular gatherings; and the younger Jasmin, who used generally to accompany him, was thus early familiarized with the double part which he afterwards so successfully filled himself. When sixteen years of age he found employment at a hairdresser’s shop, and subsequently started a similar business of his own on the Gravier at A gen. It is opposite this scene of his ripening genius and daily work that a statue has been erected to his memory by public subscription. In 1835 he published his first volume of Papillotos (“Curl Papers ”), containing poems in French (a language he used with a certain sense of restraint), and in the familiar Agen patois —the popular speech of the working classes—in which he was to achieve all his literary triumphs. Many of the pieces in this volume had already been printed and submitted to the public. The dialect which Jasmin spoke, though still harmonious and full of picturesque idioms, was now almost exclusively used by illiterate persons, and was greatly modified by a daily contact with French. It was, however, his native speech—the one in which he found spontaneous and adequate expression, and he lost no opportunity of making himself complete master of it by intercourse with the rural population in outlying districts where it was spoken with less admixture. He rehabilitated, disencumbered, and in a measure reconstructed his literary medium, and then, fully realizing that his poems needed other exposition than the mere printed text, he began those numerous public recitations which so largely added to his reputation. His real poetic gift, and his flexible voice and action, fitted him admirably for this double rôle of troubadour and jongleur. In 1835 he recited his “Blind Girl of Castel-Cuillé” at Bordeaux, in 1836 at Toulouse; and he met with an enthusiastic reception in both those important cities. Most of his public recitations were given for benevolent purposes,—1,500,000 francs, the proceeds of his poetical rounds, being contributed by him to the restoration of the church of Vergt and other good works. Four successive volumes of Papillotos were published during his lifetime, and contained amongst others the following remarkable poems, quoted in order: “The Charivari,” “My Recollections” (supplemented after an interval of many years), “The Blind Girl,” “Fran< s ∙ou-netto,” “Martha the Simple,” and “The Twin Brothers.” With the exception of the “Charivari,” these are all touching pictures of humble life,—in most cases real episodes,—carefully elaborated by the poet till the graphic descriptions, full of light and colour, and the admirably varied and melodious verse, seem too spontaneous and easy to have cost an effort. Jasmin was not a prolific writer, and, in spite of his impetuous nature, would work a long time at one poem, striving to realize every feeling he wished to describe, and give it its most lucid and natural expression. A verse from his spirited poem, “The Third of May,” written in honour of Henry IV., and published in the first volume of Papillotos, is engraved on the base of the statue erected to that king at Nérac. In 1852 Jasmin’s works were crowned by the Académie Française, and a pension was awarded him. The medal struck on the occasion bore the inscription “Au poete moral et populaire.” His title of “Maistre es Jeux” is a distinction only conferred by the academy of Toulouse on illustrious writers. Pius IX. sent him the insignia of a knight of St Gregory the Great, and he was made chevalier of the legion of honour. He spent the latter years of his life on a small estate which he had bought near Agen and named “Papillotos,” and which he describes in Ma Bigno (“My Vine”). Though invited to represent his native city, he refused to do so, preferring the pleasures and leisure of a country life, and wisely judging that he was no really eligible candidate for electoral honours. He died October 4, 1864. His last poem, an answer to Renan, was placed between his folded hands in his coffin.

The linguistic and literary revival in the south of France, which received such lustre from the genius of Jasmin, has now become a well-organized movement, and has extended from Gascony to Languedoc, and to Provence, where it is most marked.
