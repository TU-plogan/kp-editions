JANSEN [Jansenius], Cornelius (1585- 1638), bishop of Ypres, and the author of the celebrated Augustinus, was born, of humble Catholic parentage, at Acquoy or Ackooi, a small village near Leerdam, and 7 miles to the north-east of Gorcum, Holland, on 28th October 1585. After completing his preliminary studies at Leerdam and [9:13:566] Utrecht, he in 1602 proceeded to Louvain, where he studied for a short time at the Jesuit college; but afterwards, becoming dissatisfied with the doctrines there taught on the hotly discussed questions of free will and grace, he transferred himself to the college of Adrian VI., where he came under the influence of a pious and learned teacher, Jacobus Jansonius by name, who is described as having been an ardent disciple of Augustine and a follower of Michael Bajus (see Ba jus), whose doctrinal views had been condemned by Pius V. and Gregory XIII. At the same time he formed an acquaintance, which grew into intimate friendship, with the likeminded Vergerius (see Du Vergier de Hauranne), who afterwards became abbé of St Cyran. Having graduated in philosophy at Louvain in 1604, Jansen went to Paris for the benefit of his health, which had suffered from the ardour with which he had pursued his studies in theology with a view to a doctor’s degree. Here he remained for some time, supporting himself by teaching; afterwards he accompained Vergerius to Bayonne, the native place of the latter, where they spent several years together, Du Vergier ultimately becoming canon of the cathedral, and Jansen head of the episcopal college. Every available moment of their time was devoted to the study of the fathers and especially of Augustine. In 1617 Jansen returned to Louvain, whither he had been urgently summoned by Jansonius, who greatly desired to have there a man of real learning and energy who should be able to counteract the growing influence of the Jesuits. On his arrival he undertook the principal charge of the newly founded college of St Pulcheria, but this appointment he did not long retain, feeling, it is said, a growing aversion to philosophical pursuits, and desiring to possess the utmost possible leisure that he might devote himself wholly to theology. In 1619 he became doctor in that faculty. The reputation which he even then enjoyed as a theologian is well indicated by the fact that he was formally requested by the papal nuncio to undertake a reply to the recently published De Republica Ecclesiastica of Marco Antonio de Dominis, archbishop of Spalatro, while the direction in which his sympathies so strongly ran was at the same time not obscurely indicated by the fact that he excused himself from complying with the invitation. In 1624, and again in 1626, he undertook a journey to Spain, on behalf of the university, with reference to certain encroachments of the Jesuits on its exclusive privileges; in the second of these missions he was successful, the members of the Society of Jesus in the Low Countries being ordered to continue to observe the restrictions which had been laid upon them in 1612. In 1630 Jansen was made regius professor of Biblical exegesis; and in the same year, in connexion with the recent introduction of the Reformed religion into Bois-le-Duc, he entered upon a controversy about Protestantism with the learned Voetius, the issue of which conclusively showed that he had grievously underestimated his adversary’s strength. In 1635 he published a pseudonymous work entitled Alexandri Patricii Arma-cani, Theologi, Mars Gallicus, seu de justitia armorum et foederum Regis Gallise libri duo, embodying an argument and remonstrance against the policy of France in its recent alliance with the Protestant Gustavus Adolphus. For this supposed service to Spain he was rewarded in 1636 with the bishopric of Ypres. He was preparing for the press his great work upon St Augustine, which had occupied him for twenty-two years, when he was cut off by sudden illness on May 6, 1638. By his last will the MSS. of this work were bequeathed to his chaplain Lamaeus, and his friends Fromondus and Calenus, to be published “quam fidelissime”; at the same time he declared his obedience to the Roman See should any alterations be desired.

The title of the first work of Jansen against Voetius was Alexi-phαrmαcon ; it called forth Notae in Alexipharmaeon, to which he replied in his Spongia, 1630. On the publication of Voet’s Desperata Causa Ρapatus in 1635, Jansen handed over the further management of the controversy to Fromond, whose Crisis (1636) was met with Schook’s Desperatissima Causa Papatus. Among other works of Jansen are mentioned Τetrateuchus sive Commentarius in IV. Evangelia and Pentateuchus siυe Commentarius in V. libros Moysis. See Leydecker, Historia Jansenismi (Utrecht, 1695).
