JUNIUS, Franciscus (1545-1602), in French François du Jon, Huguenot divine and writer, was born of good family at Bourges, in France, May 1, 1545. He was a precocious child, and had studied law for two years under Donellus, when a place in the retinue of the French ambassador to Constantinople was procured for him in his fifteenth year. Before he reached Lyons, where he was to join the ambassador, the latter had departed; but Junius, scarcely disappointed, found ample consolation in the better opportunities for study to be found at Lyons. A religious tumult warned the young Huguenot back to Bourges, where the judicious piety of his father not only won him from certain atheistic principles that he had imbibed at Lyons, but also inspired him with the desire of entering the church. To that end he went to study at Geneva, where he was reduced to the direst straits of poverty by the failure of remittances from home, owing to civil war in France. His pride or independence allowed him to accept only the barest sustenance from a humble friend who had himself been a protégé of Junius’s family at Bourges, and his health was permanently injured by the weakness to which he was reduced. The long-expected remittance from home was closely followed by the news of the brutal murder of his father at Issoudun; and Junius resolved to remain at Geneva, where his reputation for learning now enabled him to find support by teaching. In 1565, however, he was appointed minister of the Walloon congregation at Antwerp. His foreign birth excluded him from the privileges of the native Reformed pastors, and exposed him to the persecutions of Margaret of Parma, governess of the Netherlands. Several times he barely escaped arrest, and finally, after spending six months in preaching at Limburg, he was forced to retire to Heidelberg in 1567. There he was welcomed by the elector Frederick, and temporarily settled in charge of a church at Schönau; but in 1568 his patron sent him as chaplain with the prince of Orange in his unfortunate expedition to the Netherlands. Junius escaped as soon as he could from that post, and returning to his church remained there till 1573. From 1573 till 1578 he was at Heidelberg, "assisting Tremellius in his Latin version of the Old Testament, which appeared at Frankfort in 1579; and after two and a half years distributed between Neustadt and Otterburg he was appointed to the chair of divinity at Heidelberg. Thence in a short time he was taken to France by the duke of Bouillon, and after an interview with Henry IV. was sent again to Germany on a mission. As he was returning to France, he was named professor of theology at Leyden. In that office, which he filled with success and popularity, he died October 13, 1602. Junius was a learned and pious man, and in that age of illiberal theologians was distinguished for his liberality. He was several times married; “quatuor uxores,” he naively expresses himself in his autobiography, “duxi hactenusf

He was a voluminous writer on theological subjects, and translated and composed many exegetical works. He is best known from his own edition of the Latin Old Testament, slightly altered from the former joint edition, and with a version of the New Testament added (Geneva, 1590; Hanover, 1624). The Opera Theologica Francisez Junii Biturigis were published at Geneva, 2 vols., 1613, to which is prefixed his autobiography, written about 1592. The last had been published at Leyden, 1595, and is reprinted in the Miscellanea Groningana vol. i., along with a list of the author’s other writings.
