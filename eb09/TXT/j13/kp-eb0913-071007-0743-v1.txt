+=====================================================================+


JOHN VIII. (pope from 872 to 882), successor of Adrian II., was a Roman by birth. His chief aim during his occupancy of the papal chair was to build up his temporal power by uniting the various discordant political elements of Italy into a theocracy under his own immediate control, and by subordinating the empire to the ecclesiastical authority of Rome. The qualifications he brought to the task he had undertaken were a resolute and unbending will, an unscrupulous readiness to employ any means that might best advance his purpose, and a thorough mastery of diplomatic intrigue. Events, however, were so fatally opposed to his designs that no sooner did one of his schemes begin to realize itself in fact than it was shattered and dissipated by an unlooked-for chance. To take advantage of the opportunity of winning a recognition of the dependence of the imperial authority on that of Rome, as well as to obtain an influential alliance against his enemies, he agreed, in 875, to bestow the imperial crown on Charles the Bald, but that monarch was too much occupied in Germany to grant him much effectual aid, and about the time of the death of Charles he found it necessary to come to ignominious terms with the Saracens, who were only prevented from entering Rome by the promise of an annual tribute. Carloman, the opponent of Charles’s son Louis, soon after invaded northern Italy, and, securing the support of the bishops and counts, demanded from the pope the imperial crown. John attempted to temporize, but Duke Lambert of Spoleto, a partisan of Carloman, whom events had recalled to Germany, entered Rome in 878 with an overwhelming force, and for thirty days virtually held him a prisoner in St Peter’s. He was, however, unsuccessful in winning any concession from the pope, who after his withdrawal carried out a previous purpose of going to France. There he presided at the council of Troyes, which promulgated a ban of excommunication against the supporters of Carloman—amongst others Adalbert of Tuscany, Lambert of Spoleto, and Formosus, bishop of Porto, who was afterwards elevated to the papal chair. In 879 John returned to Italy accompanied by Duke Boso of Provence, whom he adopted as his son, and made an unsuccessful attempt to get recognized as king of Italy. In the same year he was compelled to give a promise of his sanction to the claims of Charles the Fat, who received from him the imperial crown in 881. Previous to this, in order to secure the aid of the Greek emperor against the Saracens, he had agreed to sanction the restoration of Photius to the see of Constantinople, and had withdrawn his consent on finding that he reaped from the concession no substantial benefit. Charles the Fat, partly from unwillingness, partly from natural inability, gave him also no effectual aid, and the last years of John VIII. were spent chiefly in hurling vain anathemas against his various political enemies. According to the authority of Fulda, he was murdered by one of his near relations. His successor was Martin II.
