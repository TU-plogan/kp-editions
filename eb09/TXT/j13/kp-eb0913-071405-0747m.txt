JOHN (JOÂO) I. (1357-1433), king of Portugal, the natural son of Pedro I. (el Justicieiro), was born at Lisbon on April 22, 1357, and in 1364 was created grand-master of Aviz. On the death of his lawful brother Ferdinand I., without male issue, in October 1383, strenuous efforts were made in various quarters to secure the succession in the legitimate line for Beatrice, the only child of Ferdinand I., who as heiress apparent had been married to John I. of Castile; but the popular voice declared decisively against an arrangement by which Portugal would virtually have become a Spanish province, and John was after violent tumults proclaimed protector and regent in the following December. In April 1385 he was unanimously chosen king by the estates of the realm at Coimbra, and the coronation took place some little time afterwards. The king of Castile resorted to arms on behalf of his wife, and invested Lisbon, but the besieging army was compelled by the ravages of a pestilence to withdraw, and subsequently by the decisive battle of Aljubarrota (14th August 1385) the stability of John’s throne was permanently secured. Hostilities continued, however, with more or less of interruption until the death of John of Castile, without leaving issue by Beatrice, in 1390; and even after that event relations between the two countries continued to be strained. In the meanwhile John went on consolidating the power of the crown at home and the influence of the nation abroad. In 1415 Ceuta was taken from the Moors by his sons who had been born to him by his wife Philippa, daughter of John, duke of Lancaster; specially distinguished in the siege was Prince Henry, afterwards generally known as “the Navigator,” who in this and also in the following reign did so much to prepare the way for the position of colonial importance subsequently held by Portugal. Porto Santo and Madeira were occupied respectively in 1419 and 1420. John I., sometimes surnamed “the Great,” and sometimes ‘ father of his country,” died August 11, 1433, in the forty-eighth year of a reign which had been characterized by great prudence, ability, and success; he was succeeded by his son Edward or Duarte, so named out of compliment to Edward III. of England.
