JAMES II. (1430-1460), twin son of James I., was born in 1430, and, Alexander his elder brother having died in infancy, was shortly after the assassination of his father crowned king at Holyrood. During his minority the house of Douglas used every endeavour to extend their influence,— William, who succeeded to the earldom in 1443, ultimately making no pretension to conceal his claims to independent sovereignty, and at the festivities in 1449, in honour of the king’s marriage to Mary of Gueldres, with ostentatious bravado bringing in his train as many as 5000 followers. Shortly after the king attained his majority he in 1452 invited Douglas to become his guest in Stirling castle, and, on his refusing to break the “bands” he had made with the other nobles, in sudden passion stabbed him with a dagger, after which Sir Patrick Grey completed the assassination with a poleaxe. It was not till 1454 that the struggle following this act of violence, which involved all Scotland in a series of intermittent contests, was brought to a close by the flight of the Douglas and the forfeiture of his estates to the crown. His own kingdom being freed from distraction, James resolved to take advantage of the protracted intestine conflict in England, known as the Wars of the Roses, to wrest from the English the possessions they held in the south of Scotland; but while conducting the siege of Roxburgh castle he was killed by the bursting of a cannon, 3d August 1460.
