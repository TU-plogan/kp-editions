JAMESTOWN, a village in Chautauqua county, New York, is situated on the Chautauqua Outlet at the southern end of Chautauqua Lake, about 55 miles south-south-west of Buffalo. It may be conveniently reached by rail, or by steamer from Mayville at the north end of the lake, and its vicinity is steadily rising into favour as a summer resort. The manufactures include alpaca, woollens, pianos and furniture, sashes and blinds, edge-tools and iron. The population, which in 1870 was 5336, was 7264 in 1880.
