JARROW-ON-TYNE, a town and municipal burgh of Durham, is situated on the south bank of the Tyne, 3 miles south-west by west of South Shields, and 7 miles south-east of Newcastle, with which it is connected by rail. The parish church of St Paul, rebuilt in 1783 and again in 1866, still retains some fragments of the original Saxon edifice founded about 685. Close by are the scattered ruins of the monastery begun by the pious Biscop in 681, and consecrated with the church by Ceolfrid in 685. Within the walls of this monastery the Venerable Bede spent his life from childhood; and his body was at first buried within the church, whither, until it was removed under Edward the Confessor to Durham, it attracted many pilgrims. The other chief buildings are the various chapels, the mechanics’ institute, and the hospital. Jarrow Slake is a river bay, 1 mile long by ∣ mile broad, in which it is said the fleet of King Egfrid found a station. On its banks are the new Tyne docks, formed at a great expense by the North-Eastern Railway Company. These with the quays and adjacencies cover about 300 acres, of which 50 are water surface with a tidal basin of 10 acres. The erection of the docks gave a great impetus to the trade of Jarrow. Tn 1877, 4,000,000 tons of coal were shipped thence. Iron shipbuilding (one yard employing 5000 hands), ironfounding, and the manufacture of paper and chemicals are the chief sources of wealth, in addition to coal-mining. In [9:13:594] 1875 Jarrow was constituted a municipal borough, with an extent of 851 acres. The population in 1881 was 25,296. Previous to 1875 Jarrow had been a local board district; this had a population in 1871 of 18,115.
