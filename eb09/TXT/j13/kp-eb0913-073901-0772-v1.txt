JONES, Owen (1741-1814), a Welsh antiquary, was born in 1741 at Llanvihangel Glyn y Myvyr in Denbighshire, and died September 26, 1814, in Thames Street, London. Introduced in 1760 to the service of a London firm of furriers (Kidney & Nutt), he ultimately succeeded to their business, and continued to carry it on with success till his death. His fancy had been fired in boyhood with a passion for the poetry of his country, and, when wealth and leisure were attained, he devoted them both to the acquisition of the ancient monuments of the art. Assisted by Edward William of Glamorgan (Iolo Morganwg), and Dr Owen Pughe, he published, at a cost of more than £1000, the well-known Hyvyrian Archaeology of Wales (Lond., 1801-7, 3 vols.), a great collection of pieces dating from the 6th to the 14th century. The manuscripts which he had brought together are now deposited in the British Museum,—the material not utilized in the Myvyrian Archaiology amounting to 100 volumes containing 16,000 pages of verse and 15,300 pages of prose. Jones was the founder of the Gwyneddigion Society (1772) in London for the encouragement of Welsh studies and literature; and he commenced in 1805 a miscellany—the Greal —of which, however, only one volume appeared. An edition of the poems of Davydd ab Gwilym was also issued at his expense. A new edition of the Myvyrian Arclιaiology was published at Denbigh in 1870.
