JUXON, William (1582-1663), archbishop of Canterbury, was born at Chichester in 1582. Through the interest of his father with the Company of Merchant Taylors he received an appointment to their school, after which he entered St John’s College, Oxford, where he was elected a fellow in 1598. · In 1603 he became a student of Gray’s Inn, but afterwards he took holy orders, and in 1609 had become vicar of St Giles, Oxford, an appointment which he resigned for the rectorship of Somerton, Oxfordshire, in 1615. On the recommendation of Laud he succeeded him in November 1621 as president of St John’s College; and in 1626 he became vice-chancellor of the university. Having by the continued favour of Laud been promoted successively dean of Worcester, prebendary of Chichester, bishop of Hereford, and bishop of London, he attained finally a dignity outside the ordinary sphere of ecclesiastical aspiration, by being appointed in 1625 to the office of lord high treasurer. The appointment, unusual in itself, was preposterously beyond Juxon’s claims, but his strict pro bity, his prudence, and his quiet and conciliating behaviour won him the regard and goodwill even of those most opposed to him in politics. He resigned this office in 1641. Charles I. chose Juxon to administer to him the last consolations of religion. During the period of puritan ascendancy the bishop retired to his estate of I.ittle Compton, Gloucestershire, where he kept a pack of hounds much famed in the district. At the Restoration he was, on September 20,1660, promoted to the see of Canterbury. He died at Lambeth palace, June 4, 1663.

Juxon was the author of the Subjects' Sorrow, or Lamentations upon the Death of Britain’s Josiah, King Charles, a Sermon, 1660, and Some Considerations upon the Act of Uniformity, 1662. See Memoirs of Archbishop Juxon and his Times, Oxford, 1869.
