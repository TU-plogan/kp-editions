JAHN, Otto (1813-1869), eminent alike as an archaeologist, philologist, and art critic, was born June 16, 1813, at Kiel, where he began under Nitzsch the philological and archaeological education which he continued at Leipsic under Hermann and at Berlin under Lachmann and Gerhard. After the completion of his university studies he travelled for three years (1836-39) in France and Italy; having “habilitated” in 1839 at Kiel, he in 1842 became professor-extraordinary of archaeology and philology at Greifswald, where in 1845 he was promoted to the rank of ordinarius. In 1847 he accepted the chair of archaeology at Leipsic, but for having taken part in the political movements of 1848-49 he was deprived in 1851. He continued to remain in private life until in 1855 he was appointed ordinary professor of the science of antiquity, and director of the academical art museum at Bonn. In 1867 he was called to succeed Gerhard at Berlin; but after a lingering illness he died at Göttingen, September 9, 1869.
