JAMIESON, John (1759-1838), author of the Scottish Dictionary, was born in Glasgow, where his father was a Dissenting clergyman, March 3, 1759. He was educated at Glasgow university, and subsequently attended classes in Edinburgh. After six years’ theological study, Jamieson was licensed to preach in 1779. From 1780 till 1797 he was pastor of the Secession (Antiburgher) congregation of Forfar; and from 1797 till his death on July 12, 1838, he occupied the pulpit of the Antiburgher church in Nicolson Street, Edinburgh.

Jamieson’s name stands at the head of a tolerably long list of works in the Bibliotheca Britannica·, but by far his most important book is the laborious and erudite compilation, best described by its own title-page :— An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language; illustrating the words in their different significations by examples from Ancient and Modern Writers; shewing their Affinity to those of other Languages, and especially the Northern; explaining many terms xvhich though now obsolete in England were formerly common to both countries; and elucidating National Rites, Customs, and Institutions in their Analogy to those of other nations; to which is prefixed a Dissertation on the Origin of the Scottish Language. This appeared in 2 vols. 4to, at Edinburgh in 1808, followed in 1825 by a Supplement, in 2 vols. 4to, in which he was assisted by scholars in all parts of the country. Both appeared together in later editions; in 1879 the first volume of an edition, in which the Supplement is incorporated in the body of the work, was published. Abridgments of the Dictionary have been issued in 1818, and in many subsequent years. Among Jamieson’s other works may be mentioned The Use of Sacred History, 2 vols., 1802; Hermes Scythicus, or the Radical Affinities of the Greek and Latin Languages to the Gothic, 1814; and various essays, sermons, and poems. For his Vindication of the Doctrine of Scripture and of the Primitive Faith concerning the Deity of Christ, 1795, a reply to Dr Priestley, Jamieson received the degree of D.D. from the college of New Jersey.

J AMNIA (Ίαμνία or Ιdμveια), the Greek form of the Hebrew name Jabneel (Josh. xv. 11) or Jabneh (2 Chron. xxvi. 6), the modern Arabic Yebna, a city of Palestine,, on the border between Dan and Judah, situated 13 mileβ south of Jaffa, and 4 miles east of the sea-shore. The [9:13:564] modern village .stands on an isolated sandy hillock, surrounded by gardens, with olives to the north, and sand-dunes to the west. It contains a small Gothic church, now a mosque. The place belonged to the Philistines in Biblical times, was taken by Judas Maccabaeus (2 Mac. xii. 8, 9), and is mentioned by Strabo (xvi. 2) as a very populous village. The population was mainly Jewish (Philo, Leg. ad Caium, § 30), and the town is principally famous as having been the seat of the Sanhedrin from 70 to 135 A.D. In 1144 a crusading fortress was built on the hill; it is often mentioned under the name Ibelin. There was also a Jabneel in Lower Galilee (Josh. xix. 33), called later Caphar Yama, the present village Yemma, 12 English miles south of Tiberias; and another fortress in Upper Galilee was named Jamnia (Joseph., Vita, 37).
