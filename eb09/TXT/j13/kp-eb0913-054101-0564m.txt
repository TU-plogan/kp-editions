JAEN, a province of Spain, in the north-east of Andιlucia, is bounded on the N. by Ciudad Real, on the E. by Albacete and Granada, on the S. by Granada, and on the W. by Cordoba, and has an area of 5184 square miles. It may be described in general terms as consisting of the upper basin of the Guadalquivir, by which it is traversed from east to west. The main affluents of that river within the province are the Guadianamenor on the left and the Guadalimar on the right. Situated immediately between the Morena and Nevada chains, Jaen is largely overrun by lofty spurs from both those systems, the most prominent being the Loma de Chiclana and the Loma de Ubeda in connexion with the former, and the Sierras de Cazorla, de Segura, and del Pozo, with the more isolated Sierra Magina and Monte Jabalcuz in connexion with the latter. As in the other provinces presenting similar physical conditions, there are great inequalities of climate, that of the valleys being warm and admitting of olive and vine culture, while the bleak wind-swept uplands are only available as sheep walks. The mineral wealth of Jaen, which has been known from the time of the Romans, is great, and the mining industry (Linares) is the most important in the province. Agriculture is in a very backward state, the grain produced being insufficient for local demands. The total population in 1877 was 422,972. There are twenty-four towns with a population exceeding 5000,—the most important being, besides Jaen the capital, Alcalâ la Real, Andüjar, Baeza, Bailen, Linares, Martos, Ubeda.
