JUANES, or Joanes, Vicente (1523-1579), head of the Valencian school of painters, and often called “the Spanish Raphael,” was born at Fuente de la Higuera in the province of Valencia in 1523. Of his biography practically no authentic facts have been preserved. He is said to have studied his art for some time in Rome, with which school his affinities are closest, but the greater part of his professional life was spent in the city of Valencia, where most of the extant examples of his work are now to be found. All relate to religious subjects, and are characterized by dignity of conception, accuracy of drawing, truth and beauty of colour, and minuteness of finish. The best known are the Entombment, the Nativity, the Burial of a Monk, and the Martyrdom of St Agnes. His style is also seen to full advantage in the series on the life of St Stephen, originally painted for the church of San Esteban in Valencia, and now in the Museo at Madrid. He died at Bocairente (near Jativa) while engaged upon an altarpiece in the church there, on 21st December 1579.
