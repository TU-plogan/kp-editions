JONES, William (1726-1800), a divine of the Church of England, and one of the principal followers of John Hutchinson, was born at Lowick, Northamptonshire, July 30, 1726. By his father’s side he was descended from an old Welsh family, and one of his progenitors was Colonel Jones, brother-in-law of Cromwell. He was educated at Charterhouse school, from which he received an exhibition to University College, Oxford. There a kindred taste for music, as well as a similarity in regard to other points of character, led to his close intimacy with George Horne, afterwards bishop of Norwich, who, chiefly through his arguments, was induced to embrace Hutchinsonian doctrines. After obtaining his bachelor’s degree in 1749, Jones was curate successively at Finedon and Waddenhoe in Northamptonshire. In 1764 he was presented to the vicarage of Bethersden in Kent, and shortly afterwards to the rectory of Pluckley in the same county, where he took up his residence. In 1776 he removed to Nayland, Suffolk, of which he obtained the perpetual curacy, and, although in 1798 he became rector of Hollingboum, Kent, he continued to reside at Nayland till his death, 6th January 1800.

In 1756 Jones published his tractate On the Catholic Doctrine of the Trinity, a statement of the doctrine from the Hutchinsonian point of view, with a succinct and able summary of Scriptural proofs. This was followed in 1762 by an Essay on the First Principles of Natural Philosophy, in which he maintained the theories of Hutchinson in opposition to those of Sir Isaac Newton, and in 1781 he gave a more extended exposition of his opinions in Physiological Disquisitions. Among his other works are— Lectures on the Figurative Language of the Holy Scripture, 1786; The Scholar Armed, 1792; and a life of Bishop Home, prefixed to Home’s collected Works, 1795. Jones was also the originator of the British Critic, the first number of which appeared in May 1793. His collected works, with a life by W. Steevens, appeared in 1801, in 12 vols., and his theological and miscellaneous works with life were reprinted in 1810. Since that time various editions of his works have appeared, as well as some volumes of his sermons. A life of Jones, forming part 5 of the Biography of English Divines, was published in 1849.
