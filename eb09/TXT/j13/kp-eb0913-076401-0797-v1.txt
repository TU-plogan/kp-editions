JUDGMENT is the last stage in an action, being the definitive order or sentence of the court or judge, enforceable by the appropriate mode of “execution” appointed by law. In English law the writ of execution remains in force only for one year unless renewed, but a writ of execution may be obtained at any time within six years of the judgment, and after six years the application may be made to the court by any person entitled to execution, and execution may issue accordingly. Judgments by courts of an alien jurisdiction are not immediately enforceable as judgments in England, but they constitute a cause of action, and may be sued upon. They are in fact conclusive as between the parties, although objections going to deny the jurisdiction of the court r or showing that the defendant had not been summoned and had never really been before it, would be a good defence. It has lately been held no defence to an action in a foreign judgment that it disclosed on the face of it a manifest misapprehension by the foreign court of a rule of English law.
