JUSTIN, Latin historian, called in one MS. Justinus Frontinus, in another M. Junianus Justinus, in others simply Justinus, is known from his Historiarum Philippi-carum Libri XL1V., a work described by himself in his preface as a collection of the most important and interesting passages from the voluminous Historiae Philippicae et totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs, written-in the time of Augustus by Trogus Pompeius. Of Justin’s personal history absolutely nothing is known. The passage in his preface on which was based the belief that he lived under Antoninus Pius is spurious; but a reference to him by St Jerome fixes his date at some point before the 5th century. The work of Trogus is lost, probably helped into oblivion by the shorter compilation; but the prologi, or arguments, of the forty-four books are extant, and a few fragments of the text are preserved by Pliny and other writers. From the ρrologi we gather that, although the main theme of Trogus was the rise and history of the Macedonian monarchy, he yet permitted himself a freedom of digression that extended very considerably the field of description, and makes it all the more to be regretted that Justinus chose to write a capricious anthology lf>reve velυti florum corpusculum) instead of a regular epitome of the work. As it stands, however, Justin’s history contains a large amount of valuable information, which but for it we might never have possessed. The style, though far from perfect, has the merit of clearness, occasionally even of elegance.

The editio princeps of Justinus appeared at Venice, 1470, folio, from Jenson’s press. An edition, folio, Rome, is referred to 1470 or 1471. The other chief editions are those of Sabellicus, Venice, folio, 1490, 1497, and 1507; Aldus, Venice, 8vo, 1522; Bongarsius, Paris, 8vo, 1581; Graevius, Leyden, 8vo, 1683; Hearne, Oxford, 8vo, 1705; Gronovius, Leyden, 1719 and 1760 (2d ed. in “Variorum” Classics); Frotscher, Leipsic, 8vo, 3 vols., 1827-30; Diibner, Leipsic, 8vo, 1831; and Diibner and Johanneau, Paris, 2 vols., 1838. Translations appeared very early in the chief European languages. There are English versions by Goldinge, 1564; Holland, 1606; Codrington, 1654; Brown, 1712; Bailey, 1732; Clarke, 1732; Turnbull, 1746; and Watson, 1853.
