JOSEPH II. (1741-1790), Holy Roman emperor, born in Vienna March 13, 1741, was the son of the emperor Francis I. and Maria Theresa, He was made king of the Romans in 1764; and in 1765 he succeeded his father as Holy Roman emperor. Maria Theresa declared him coregent of her hereditary states, but almost all real power she retained in her own hands. He received full authority only in the regulation of the military system, into which he introduced many changes, following in the main the example of Frederick the Great. Chiefly by his advice Maria Theresa was induced to associate herself with Russia and Prussia in the partition of Poland; and in 1777 he persuaded her to force Turkey to surrender Bukowina. When the younger branch of the house of Wittelsbach died out in 1777, Joseph claimed a large part of its territory; but Frederick the Great resisted his pretensions, and in 1779, after a nominal war, the emperor accepted the treaty of Teschen, by which he obtained only a small concession. Before this time he had sought to prepare himself for his future duties by extensive travels in his own states and in foreign countries; and everywhere he had made a favourable impression by his genial courtesy. In 1769 he had visited Frederick the Great, for whom he had at that time a warm admiration; and in the following year Frederick returned the visit, going back to Prussia with the conviction that it would be necessary “to keep his eye on that young man.” On the death of Maria Theresa in 1780, Joseph became sole ruler of the Austrian states. He was penetrated by the characteristic ideas of the 18th century as to the duties of an absolute monarch, and began at once to give effect to them in a fearless and almost revolutionary spirit. His first step was to combine the various nationalities subject to him into a single state with thirteen administrative districts. He refused to be crowned king of Hungary, and would not summon the Hungarian diet, insisting that the country should be governed as a province, and causing German to be used as the official language. Among other reforms he proclaimed the abolition of serfdom, substituted various punishments for the capital penalty, established common tribunals, and issued new codes based on the principle that all citizens are equal before the law. He transferred the censorship of books from the clergy to laymen of liberal sympathies, and granted complete freedom to journalism. He instituted public libraries and observatories, founded a medical college in Vienna, a university in Lemberg, and schools for the middle classes in various parts of the monarchy, and encouraged art by offering prizes in connexion with the academy of the plastic arts. Industry and trade he fostered by destroying many monopolies, by aiding in the establishment of new manufactures, by raising Fiume to the position of a free harbour, and by opening the Danube to his subjects from its source to the Black Sea. His ecclesiastical policy was of so bold a character that Pope Pius VI. went to Vienna for the purpose of expostulating with him, but found that the emperor was beyond the range of his influence. The hierarchy was forbidden to correspond with the Roman see without express permission; and papal bulls were subjected to the Placetum Regium. In 1781 he issued an edict of toleration, granting freedom of worship to all Protestants and to members of the Greek Church; and between 1782 and 1790 about seven hundred monasteries were closed, the members of religious orders being reduced from 63,000 to 27,000. All these changes were well-meant, but the emperor, in the ardour of his philanthropy, shot too far ahead of the prevailing sentiment of his people. Moreover, his good intentions were often rendered fruitless by unskilful or unsympathetic subordinates. In nearly every part of the monarchy discontent soon manifested itself, and some of the inhabitants of Tyrol broke into open rebellion. The Hungarians bitterly resented the suppression of their ancient privileges, and in 1787 the emperor’s new institutions led in several districts to a furious conflict between the peasantry and the nobles. The estates of the Austrian Netherlands persistently opposed the execution of his schemes, the clergy being especially active in stirring up popular indignation; and when, in 1789, he altogether destroyed their constitution, they rebelled and were able for some months to maintain their independence. In Hungary there was so dangerous an agitation that in January 1790 Joseph had to undo almost everything he had attempted to accomplish in that country during the previous nine years; he succeeded only in maintaining the decrees by which he had abolished serfdom and established toleration. Thus his last days were rendered miserable by the conviction that his career had been a failure. He was not more fortunate in his foreign policy than in his home government. Early in his reign, indeed, he gained some advantages over the Dutch, who were obliged to abandon their fortresses on the frontier of the Austrian Netherlands. And when they refused to open the Scheldt, they had to compensate him (in 1785) by a payment of ten million florins. In the same year he renewed his claims on Bavarian territory, but was thwarted by Frederick the Great, who formed his famous league of princes for the [9:13:751] protection of the German states against Austrian ambition. After the conclusion of the treaty of Teschen, Joseph made it one of the chief objects of his foreign policy to form an enduring alliance between Austria and Russia; and in 1788, in association with Catherine II., he declared war against Turkey. He did not' live to see the end of this war, which brought him little honour. On the 20th of February 1790 he died, deeply disappointed that he had been able to achieve so few of the objects with which he had begun his reign. He was twice married, first to the Princess Marie Louise of Parma, afterwards to the Princess Marie Josephe of Bavaria. His only daughter died in childhood, so that he was succeeded by his brother Leopold II. Notwithstanding the defeat of so many of bis plans, his reign marked an epoch in the history of Austria; and the interest still excited by his name was shown by the enthusiasm with which the people of Austria celebrated in 1880 the centenary of his accession as sole ruler. On the pedestal of his statue in Vienna, erected by Francis I. in 1807, are these words:—“Josepho secundo, qui saluti publicae vixit non diu, sed totus.” (j. si.)
