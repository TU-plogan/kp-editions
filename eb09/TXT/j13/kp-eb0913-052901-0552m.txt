JABIRU, according to Marcgrave^[1. An apparently accidental transposai of two of the figures given by this author (Hist. Nat. Brasiliae, pp. 200, 201) misled several of his successors from Piso to Brisson, until noticed by De Buffon (Hist. Nah Oiseaux, vii. pp. 280-286). ] the Brazilian name of a bird, subsequently called by Linnaeus Hycteria americana, one of the largest of the Storks, Ciconiidae, which occurs from Mexico southwards to the territory of the Argentine Republic. It stands between 4 and 5 feet in height, and is conspicuous for its massive bill, slightly upturned, and its entirely white plumage; but the head and neck are bare and black, except for about the lower third part of the latter, which is bright red in the living bird. Very nearly allied to Myctema, and also commonly called Jabirus, are the birds of the genera Xeηorhynchus and Ephippiorhyηchus —the former containing one or (in the opinion of some) two species, X. australis and X. indicus, and the latter one only, E. seηegalensis. These belong to the countries indicated by their names, and differ chiefly by their feathered head and neck, while the last is sometimes termed the Saddle-billed Stork from the very singular shape of its beak. Somewhat more distantly related are the gigantic birds, known to Europeans in India and elsewhere as Adjutants, belonging to the genus Leptoptilus, distinguished by their sad-coloured plumage, their black scabrous head, and their enormous tawny pouch, which depends occasionally some 16 inches or more in length from the lower part of the neck, and seems to be connected with the respiratory, and not, as commonly believed, with the digestive system. In many parts of India L. dul>ius, the largest of these birds, the Hargila as Hindus call it, is a most efficient scavenger, sailing aloft at a vast height and descending on the discovery of offal, though frogs and fishes also form part of its diet. It familiarly enters the large towns, in many of which on account of its services it is strictly protected from injury, and, having satisfied its appetite, seeks the repose it has earned, sitting with its feet extended in front in a most grotesque attitude. A second and smaller species, L. javanicus, has a more southern and eastern range; while a third, L. crumeηifer, of African origin, and often known as the Marabou-Stork, gives its name to the beautifully soft feathers so called, though our markets are mostly supplied with them by the Indian species (in which they form the lower tail-coverts), if not, as some suppose, by Vultures.
