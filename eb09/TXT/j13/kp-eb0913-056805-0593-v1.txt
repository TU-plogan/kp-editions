JANUS, a Roman god, after whom the month of January was named. His temple was open in war and closed during peace, and the ceremony of closing it for the third time in Roman history was performed by Augustus, 29 B,c., when he had established his authority over the whole empire. This temple, which was in reality only an arch or gateway, facing east and west, stood near the forum. When most of the Roman gods were merged in Greek divinities, Janus retained his native character. Amid the obscurity that hangs over the genuine Roman religion, it is difficult to determine the nature and origin of Janus. It .is probable that he was the chief deity of one of the races which were united in the Roman people, and that his worship was maintained beside, but overshadowed by, that of Jupiter, the chief deity of another of these races. The hill of Janus, Janiculum, lay on the north or Etruscan side of the Tiber, and was doubtless the seat of his original worshippers. An Etruscan origin is thus suggested, and most authorities accept this hypothesis. The Romans themselves thought that Janus and the feminine Jana, i.e., Diana, were sun and moon; and the names are commonly assimilated to the Greek Zτ)ι∕, ie., ∆iηv. If, however, Janus was an Etruscan god, belonging to the Etruscan element in Rome, he must then be identified with the Etruscan deity Ani, the form of the name being prompted by the word janua, as Janus is the god of opening and beginning. The god is represented with two faces looking in opposite directions, a design found on the coins of the Etruscan Volaterra, but possibly due to the influence of Greek art.

See Preller, Röm. Myth. ; Gerhard, Griech. Myth.,∖∖. ; Hartung, Rclig. der Römer ; Schwegler, Röm. Geschichte, &c.; Deecke, Templum von Biαcenzα. Mommsen in his history proposes a different view.
