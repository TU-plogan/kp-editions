JULY ", the seventh month in our present calendar, consists of thirty-one days. It was originally the fifth month of the year, and as such was called by the Romans Quinc-tilis. The later name of Julius was given in honour of Julius Caesar (who was born in the month), and came into use in the year of his death. Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors called July Maed-monâcî, “mead month,” from the meadows being then in their bloom; and äftera Li∂'a, “the latter mild month,” in contradistinction to June, which they named “the former mild month.” The principal days now observed and noted in this month are the following :— July 3d, Dog Days begin; July 15th, St Swithin; and July 25th, St James.
