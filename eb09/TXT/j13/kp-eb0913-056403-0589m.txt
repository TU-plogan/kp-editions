JAMU, or Jummoo, a town in Kashmir state, Punjab, India, headquarters of Jamu province, in 32° 43' 52" N. lat. and 74° 54' 14" E. long, on the Tâvi, a tributary of the Chenab, among the mountains of the outer Himâlayan range. The town and palace stand upon the right bank of the river; the fort overhangs the left shore at an elevation of 150 feet above the stream. The lofty whitened walls of the palace and citadel present a striking appearance from the surrounding country. An adjacent height commands the fortress, rendering it untenable against modern artillery. Extensive and handsome pleasure grounds and ruins of great size in the suburbs attest the former prosperity of the city when it was the seat of a Râjput dynasty of independent râjâs, whose dominions extended into the plains and included the modern district of Siâlkot. It was afterwards conquered by the Sikhs, and formed part of Ranjit Sinh’s dominions. For its susbequent acquisition by Ghulâb Sinh, see Kashmir. The population is estimated at about 8000.
