JESSE, Edward (1780-1868), a writer on natural history, was born 14th January 1780, at Hutton Cranswick, Yorkshire, where his father was vicar. He became clerk in one of the Government offices in 1798, and for a time was secretary to Lord Dartmouth, when pιesident of the Board of Control, through whom he also received an office at court. In 1812 he was appointed commissioner of [9:13:645] hackney coaches, and not long afterwards he became deputy surveyor-general of the royal parks and palaces. On the abolition of this office he retired on a pension, and he died at Brighton 28th March 1868. The office which Mr Jesse filled in connexion with the royal parks induced him to take a considerable interest in the habits and characteristics of animals, the result of which was seen in a series of pleasant and popular books on natural history, the principal of which are Gleanings in Natural History, 3 vols., 1832-35; An AnglePs Rambles, 1836; Anecdotes of Dags, 1846; and Lectures on Natural History, 1863. He also edited Walton’s Complete Angler, White’s Selborne, and Ritchie’s Windsor Castle, and wrote a number of handbooks to places of interest, including Windsor and Hampton Court.
