JACOBS, Christian Friedrich Wilhelm (1764-1847), a German scholar and author, was born at Gotha, October 6, 1764. After studying philology and theology at Jena and Göttingen, he in 1785 became teacher in the gymnasium of his native town, and in 1802 was appointed to an office in the public library. In 1807 he became classical teacher in the lyceum of Munich, but he again returned to Gotha in 1810 to take the charge of the library and the numismatic cabinet. From 1831 to 1842 he was superintendent of the art collections of the town. He died at Gotha, March 30, 1847.

Jacobs, besides editing a large number of the less known Greek and Latin authors, was a voluminous translator and also a successful writer in various departments of general literature. Of his editorial labours the most important is the edition of the Anthologia Graeca, 13 vols., 1794-1814. He also published translations from the Greek Anthology under the title Tempe, 2 vols., 1803. His Elementarbuch der griechischen Sprache, 1805, has gone through many editions. His miscellaneous essays on classical subjects were published collectively at various periods under the title Vermischte Schriften, and amount in all to 8 volumes. Among his other writings may be mentioned Schriften für die Jugend, 3 vols., 1842-44; and Erzählungen, 7 vols., 1824-37.
