JOSÉPHINE (1763-1814), empress of the French, was born at Trois-Ilets, Martinique, on the 23d of June 1763, and was the eldest of three daughters born to Joseph Tascher de la Pagerie, lieutenant in the artillery, and his wife Rose-Claire Des Vergers de Sannois. She was educated at a local convent, from which she was withdrawn in her fifteenth year, knowing how to dance, sing, and embroider, but little else. Au aunt, resident in France, was godmother to the second son of the Marquis de Beauharnais, once the governor of Martinique; and she suggested a marriage between her god-child and niece. After much negotiation between the families, in which the second and youngest daughters were both preferred to Joséphine, her father carried her to Havre in 1779, she being already described to her aunt and the Beauharnais as possessing a fine complexion, beautiful arms and eyes, and with a sweet voice and a remarkable taste for music—altogether “très-avancée et formée pour son âge.” On the 13th of December she was married to the Vicomte Alexandre Beauharnais at Noisy-le-Grand. Her son Eugène was born at a time when her relations with her husband were embittered by jealousy; and after the birth of her daughter Hortense-Eugénie he sought a separation, but, though he carried his request to the parliament, his petition was dismissed. Joséphine went back to her parents in June 1788, and was with them when the Revolution broke out. At the request of the vicomte she returned, however, to France in 1790. He was then a member of the constituent assembly, receiving at his house the chiefs of the constitutional party; and Joséphine was admired by all of them for her dignity, simplicity, and sweetness. As the crisis became more acute, her husband thought it prudent to withdraw to Ferté-Beauharnais, in Sologne, where he left his family when he went to command the army of the Rhine. After his execution by order of the Convention, Joséphine was reduced to great straits, and not till the end of 1795 did regular remittances from Martinique begin again. She was living in the Rue Chautereine, Paris, in a house of her own, when she paid her first visit ta Napoleon, to thank him for restoring the sword of her husband. She was in the full flower of her womanhood; Napoleon was at once drawn to her; on the 9th of March 1796 they were married. In twelve days he left her to take command of the army in Italy; but in J une, at his earnest request, she joined him at Milan and went on to Brescia. After the peace of Léoben they lived at Montebello near Milan, and Joséphine was for some time the queen of a court frequented by great officers and diplomatists. Having visited Rome, she went back to Paris, and at her house assembled the most distinguished men of the day. During the expedition to Egypt she moved between the capital and Plombières; but she had her first quarrel with Napoleon on his return, because, by an oversight, she omitted meeting him. Social duties of the most brilliant and difficult sort began to accumulate round her during the consulate. At the palace of the Luxembourg and the Tuileries her drawing-room was again the centre of attraction in Paris; her receptions were ruled by the old traditions of regal ceremony, and there was an endless round of fetes, entertainments, and plays. Her beauty and amiability won upon everybody; and when she wanted rest she retired to Malmaison, a country seat she had bought, and amused herself with a variety of light studies in botany and natural history. Rumours now began to reach her that Napoleon, in despair of offspring, meant to sue for a divorce. She had long known that his relatives were trying to undermine her position; and even when she knelt beside him at Notre Dame, and received ’the triple unction at the ceremony which crowned her empress, she knew it to be a concession wrung from him. After the coronation he gave her less and less of his society. It was not, however, until the winter of 1809 that he deliberately proposed to dissolve the connexion. He divorced her with much show of tenderness, and she retired to Malmaison with an annual grant of two million francs for her establishment. Her affection for Napoleon, and her anxiety for his success, remained strong to the hour of her death, on May 24, 1814; and but for his inordinate ambition he would never have sought to live apart from her. She often provoked him by a certain mild duplicity in her character; she was extravagant and superstitious; yet, to fulfil the high destiny to which she was called, she brought much gentleness, courage, and sweetness, qualities which carried her through her reverses with admirable dignity.
