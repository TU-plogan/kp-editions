JUKES, Joseph Beete (1811-1869), geologist, was born near Birmingham, October 10, 1811. Educated first at Wolverhampton grammar-school and afterwards at King Edward’s School, Birmingham, he passed in 1830 to St John’s College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1836. At Cambridge he began the study of geology under Sedgwick, and in 1839, after three years of study, lecturing, and writing, he was appointed geological surveyor of Newfoundland. He returned to England at the end of 1840, and in April 1842 sailed as naturalist on board H.M.S. “Fly,” despatched to survey Torres Strait, New Guinea, and the east coast of Australia. Jukes landed in England again in June 1846, and in August received an appointment to the geological survey of Great Britain. The district to which he was sent was North Wales. In 1850 he accepted the post of local director of the geological survey of Ireland. The exhausting nature of his work slowly but surely wore out even his robust constitution, and on July 29, 1869, he died. Immediately on leaving college, Jukes became a member of the London Geological Society, and in 1852 he was admitted to the Dublin Geological Society, of which he was president in 1853 and 1854. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society. For many years he lectured as professor of geology, first at the Royal Dublin Society’s Museum of Irish Industry, and afterwards at the Royal College of Science in Dublin.

In addition to the reports of his various appointments, Jukes wrote very many papers and memoirs, to be found in the London and Dublin geological journals and other periodicals. While in Ireland he edited, and in great measure wrote, forty-two memoirs explanatory of the maps of the south, east, and west of Ireland, and prepared a geological map of Ireland on a scale of 8 miles to an inch. He was also the author of Excursions in and about Newfoundland, 2 vols., 1842; Narrative of the Surveying Voyage of H.M.S. ii Flyf 2 vols., 1847; A Sketch of the Physical Structure of Australia, 1848; Popular Physical Geology, 1853; On the Geology of Australia, 1853; Student's Manual of Geology, 1857 (later editions, 1862, 1872); the article Geology, in the 8th edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1858; and School Manual of Geology, 1863. See Letters, <kc., of J. Beete Jukes, edited, with connecting memorial notes, by his sister (C. A. Browne), 1871, to which is added a chronological list of Jukes’s writings.
