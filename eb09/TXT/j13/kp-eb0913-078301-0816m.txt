JURA, an eastern frontier department of France, formed of the southern portion of the old province of Franche-Comté, owes its name to the offshoots and plateaus of the Jura mountains, which occupy more than half its area. It is bounded N. by Doubs, Haute-Saône, and Côte-d’Or; E. by Doubs, Ain, and Switzerland; S. by Ain; and W. by Saône-et-Loire and Côte d’Or. Lying between 46° 15' and 47° 17' N. lat., and between 5° 15' 39" and 6° 8' 9" E. long., its greatest length from north to south is 143 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west 83 miles. The department is divided by a not very broad zone of hills into a region of plain in the north and north-west, and a region of mountains in the south-east, increasing in height towards the Swiss frontier. The highest summit is Noir Mont (5085 feet). Jura belongs almost entirely to the basin of the Rhone,—its chief streams being the Oignon, Doubs, and Seille, affluents of the Saône, and the Ain and Valserine, direct tributaries of the Rhone. The Doubs and Ain are navigable. There are numerous lakes; those of Rousses, Châlin, Chambly, and of the abbey of Grandvaux are noteworthy. The climate is, on the whole, cold; the temperature is subject to sudden and violent changes, and among the mountains winter lingers for nearly six months. The plain called the Bresse is rich in fruit trees, and in fields of wheat, rye, maize, and buckwheat; the hill-region grows vines, barley, oats, maize, rape, walnuts, and fruits; the mountains, which exhibit some of the grandest scenery of leaping torrent and silent tarn, are covered with forests or pastures. Jura is one of the most thickly wooded departments of France; a third of its surface is covered with forests, of which that of Chaux, with an area of about 75 square miles, is the largest. The commonest trees are oaks, beeches, hornbeams, aspens, birches, box-trees, and firs. Wolves and foxes are numerous in Jura; wild boars and deer lurk in the forests. The principal minerals are iron, salt, limestone, marble, sandstone, millstone, and clay. Peats are very abundant. Agriculture employs about three-fourths of the inhabitants, though the manufactures extend to wine, cheese (made in the mountain dairies), watches, files, stationery, toys and fancy wooden-ware, machinery, candles, porcelain, basket-work, <fcc.; while some industry is maintained in wool-spinning, silk-weaving, and in brass, pottery, and tanning works. The trade is mainly in wines, cheese, and wooden goods. The first are full-bodied, stout, and rather coarse-flavoured; their chief market is Paris, where they form the basis of the vin ordinaire of the wine-shops. The department of Jura embraces the arrondissements of Lons-le-Saunier, Dole, Poligny, and St Claude, with 32 cantons and 583 communes. Lons-le-Saunier is the chief town. The total area is about 1928 square miles; the population in 1866 was 298,477; in 1876, 288,823.
