JOHN I. (925-976), emperor of Constantinople, surnamed on account of his short stature Zimisces, was [9:13:713] descended from a distinguished family of Cappadocia, and was the nephew of Nicephorus Phocas, whom he aided to obtain the throne, and with whom he afterwards shared the military command of the empire. Being, however, deprived of this dignity through the intrigues of the emperorâ€™s brother Leo, he entered into a conspiracy to assassinate Nicephorus, which was put into execution on the 10th December 969. The reign of Zimisces is chiefly remarkable for his victories over the Russians, and the conquest of Bulgaria. Afterwards he achieved many brilliant exploits against the Saracens, but on his way home from his Syrian campaign he was seized near Constantinople with a sudden illness, caused it is supposed by poisoning, and died there in January 976.
