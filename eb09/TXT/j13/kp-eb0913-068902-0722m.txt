JHALÄWÄR, a state in Râjputâna, under the political superintendence of the Râjputâna agency and the Government of India, mainly consisting of two separate areas. The larger is bounded on the N. by the state of Kotah; on the E. by Sindhia’s territory and a detached district of the Tonk state; on the S. by the petty state of Râjgarh, a detached district of the Dewas state, and the state of Jaora; and on the W. by detached tracts belonging to Sindhia and Holkar. This portion lies between 23° 48' and 24° 48' N. lat., and between 75° 55' and 77° E. long. The lesser detached area is bounded on the N., E., and S. by the Gwalior state, and on the W. by Kotah, and lies between 25° 5' and 25° 25' N. lat., and 76° 55' and 77° 25' E. long. The main portion of Jhâlâwâr is situated on a raised plateau. The northern, eastern, and part of the southern portions are very hilly, and intersected by numerous streams. The hills are for the most part covered with timber and grass, and frequently enclose lakes. The rest of this tract is a rich undulating plain, dotted with evergreen trees. The soil generally is very rich, consisting in great part of dark clayey mould, which produces valuable crops. Of the many streams running through the territory, the most important are—the Parwau, with its tributary the Newâj; the Kâli Sind, with its tributary the Αύ; and the Chhota Kâli Sind. The population in 1875 was 226,000, of whom the majority were Hindus. The area of the whole state is 2500 square miles.

In Jhâlâwâr all the ordinary Indian grains are cultivated, and in the southern districts opium is extensively grown. In the rest of the state wheat and opium are the chief crops, except in Shâhâbâd, where bdjrα is chiefly produced. Irrigation is principally carried on by means of wells. Near Jhalra Patan, the capital, there is a large artificial lake, from which water is drawn by a channel 2 miles long. In 1876, 507,418 acres, or barely two-fifths of the total area, were cultivated. The total revenue for 1876 was £174,719. The police number 100 horse and 2000 foot. Education is at present very backward in the state. In the districts the village priest teaches the young people. In the capital and cantonment there are schools in which Hindi, Urdu, and English are taught. The only metalled roads in the state are in the cantonment. All other roads are simply cart tracks, which in the rains are useless for wheel traffic. Opium is exported; the imports are English cloths and grain. The chief towns aτe Jhalra Patan and the chhaoni or cantonment, Shâhâbâd, and Kailwara. The climate resembles that of Central India, and is generally healthy. In the hot weather the thermometer ranges during the day from 85° to 88° Fahr. The temperature during the rains is cool and pleasant, and in the cold weather it is occasionally frosty.

The ruling family of Jhâlâwâr belongs to the Jhâlâ clan of Râjputs, and their ancestors were petty chiefs of Halwad in the district of Jhâlâwâr, in Kâthiâwâr. About 1709 one of the younger sons of the head of the clan left his country with his son to try his fortunes at Delhi. At Kotah he left his son Madhu Sinh, who soon got into great favour with the mahârâjâ, and got from him an important post, which became hereditary. On the deathbed of one of the Kotah râjâs, the country was left to the charge of Zalfιn Sinh, a descendant of Madhu Sinh. From that time Zalim Sinh was the real ruler of Kotah. He brought it to a wonderful state of prosperity, and under his administration, which lasted over forty-five years, the Kotah territory was respected by all parties. In 1838 it was resolved, with the consent of the chief of Kotah, to dismember the state, and to create the new principality of Jhâlâwâr as a separate provision for the descendants of Zalim Sinh. The districts then severed from Kotah were considered to represent one-third (£120,000) of the income of Kotah; by treaty they acknowledged the supremacy of the British, and agreed to pay an annual tribute of £8000. Madan Sinh received the title of mahârâjâ rânâ, and was placed on the same footing as the other chiefs in Râjputâna. The present mahârâjâ rânâ of Jhâlâwâr has a force of 20 field and 75 other guns, 150 artillerymen, 425 cavalιy, and 4400 infantry.
