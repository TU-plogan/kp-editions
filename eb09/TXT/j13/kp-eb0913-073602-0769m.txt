JOMMELLI, Niccolò (1714-1774), a famous Italian composer of the last century, was born at Aversa near Naples, September 11, 1714, and received his musical education at two of the famous music schools of that capital, being at first a pupil of Durante at the Conservatorio di San Onofrio, and subsequently studying composition under Leo at La Pietà dei Turchini. His first opera, L , Errore Amoroso, was produced when Jommelli was only twenty-three, at Naples, and so timid was the young composer that he prefixed a pseudonym to his work. The result, however, was favourable beyond all expectation, and encouraged Jommelli to continue his career as a dramatic composer. Three years afterwards he went to Rome to produce two new operas, and thence to Bologna, where he became acquainted with and profited by the advice of Padre Martini, the greatest contrapuntist of his age. In the meantime Jommelli’s fame began to spread beyond the limits of his country, and in 1745 he went for the first time to Vienna, where one of his finest operas, Didone, was produced. Three years later he returned to Italy, and in 1754 he obtained the post of chapel-master to the music-loving duke of Würtemberg at Stuttgart, which city he made his home for a number of years. Here he considerably modified his style in accordance with German taste, so much so that, when after an absence of fifteen years he returned to Naples, his countrymen hissed two of his operas off the stage. He retired in consequence to his native village, and only occasionally emerged from his solitude to take part in the musical life of the capital.

His last composition was a Hiser ere written a few weeks before his death, which took place at Naples, August 28, 1774. In the last-named work, as well as in his other church compositions, Jommelli proves himself to be a musician of earnest purpose and süund scholarship. Tn his operatic music he follows essentially the style of his age, being intent on writing effective pieces for the voice rather than upon expressing the feelings and passions of the characters; but even here he betrays a certain elevation of sentiment not always to be found amongst the composers of the latter half of the 18th century. His best dramatic work is generally supposed to be Armida, one of the operas scorned by the Neapolitans in 1771.
