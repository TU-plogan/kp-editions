JOHN VI. (pope from 701 to 705) was a native of Greece, and succeeded to the papal chair two months after the death of Sergius I. An attempt of the exarch Theophylact of Ravenna to extort from him certain concessions to the Byzantine emperor Tiberius was frustrated by the revolt of the Italian portion of the army with which he threatened Rome, who but for the intervention of the pope would have put their leader to death. Partly by persuasion and partly by means of a bribe, John also succeeded in inducing Gisulph, duke of Benevento, to withdraw from the territories of the church.
