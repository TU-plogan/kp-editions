JANINA, Jannina, Joannina, or, as the name is frequently written according to its actual Albanian pronunciation, Yanina, a town of European Turkey in southern Albania, or—to retain the ancient designation—Epirus. The position of Janina is strikingly picturesque. At the foot of the grey limestone mass of Mount Mitzekeli (1500 ft.), which forms part of the fine range of hills running north from the Gulf of Arta, there lies a valley (the Hellopia of antiquity) partly occupied by a lake; and on the slopes of a slight eminence, stretching down to the western shore, stands this town of St John. It has greatly declined from the state of barbaric prosperity which it enjoyed in the beginning of this century, when it was the seat of Ali Pasha, estimated to have from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants. The fortress—Demir-Kule or Iron Castle, which like the principal seraglio was built on a promontory jutting down into the lake—is now in ruins. But the town still possesses fourteen mosques, each embosomed by a cluster of trees, and there are also seven churches, two synagogues, a Greek college, a library, and a hospital. As the centre of a vilayet it contains a governor’s residence (rebuilt in 1870). Sayades (opposite Corfu) and Arta are the places through which it receives its imports. A considerable activity in trade and industry is maintained by the Greek population, the rich gold and silver embroidery for which the town has long been famous being still one of the notable articles in its bazaar. According to M. Moreau, the French consul (BuU. de la Soc. de G.eogr., Faris, 1876), Janina contained 16,230 inhabitants in 1875, of whom 4136 were Mahometans, 8989 Christians, and 3105 Jews. Synvet (Les Grecs de l' Empire Ottoman, Constantinople, 1878) reckons the Greeks alone at 14,362 (the island on the lake being included). The vilayet of Janina, previous to the cessions made to Greece in 1881, comprised the sandjaks of Janina, Argyrocastro, Berat (Avlona), Prevesa, and Thessaly, and the sandjak contains the districts of Janina (town and country), Aidwat, Prevena, Cognitza, Metzovo, and Philates. The lake (perhaps to be identified with the Pambotus of antiquity) is 6 miles long, and has an extreme breadth of 3 miles. In time of flood it is united with the smaller lake of Labchistas, which lies to the north. According to Guido Cora’s investigations in 1878, the greatest depth does not exceed 32 feet. There are no affluents of any considerable size, and the only outlets are underground passages or katavothra extending for many miles through the calcareous rocks.

The theory supported by Leake (ΛWΛenι Greece) that the citadel of Janina is to be identified with Dodona, is now generally surrendered in favour of the claims of a more southern site. As Anna Comnena, in describing the capture of the town (τα '∖οαvvιvα) by Bohemond in 1082, speaks of the walls as being dilapidated, it may be supposed that the place existed before the 11th century. It is mentioned from time to time in the Byzantine annals, and on the establishment of the lordship of Epirus by Michael Angelus Comnenas Ducas, it became his capital. During the 14th century it was frequently attacked by the Albanians; but it was still in possession of the successors of Michael when the forces of Sultan Amurath appeared before it in 1430 (ς∕ ’. Hahn, Alban. Studien, pp. 319-322). Since 1431 it has continued under Turkish rule. In modern times it became famous as the seat of the tyrant Ali (1788-1822). See Ali Pasha, vol. i. p. 573.

Descriptions of Janina will be found in Holland’s Travels, 1815; Hughes, Travels in Greece, <kc., 1830; Tozer, The Highlands of Turkey, 1869. See also Major R. Stewart, “On the Phys. Geogr. of Epirus,” in Joum. Roy. Geogr. Soc., 1869.
