JEWEL, or Jewell, John (1522-1571), bishop of Salisbury, was born May 24th 1522, at Berry Narbor, near Ilfracombe, Devonshire. At the age of thirteen he entered Merton College, Oxford, where he had for tutor John Parkhurst, afterwards bishop of Norwich, from whom his mind received a bias towards Protestantism. Becoming tutor in Corpus Christi College in 1539, he in his turn took the opportunity of inculcating Protestant principles on his pupils; and in 1546 he received an allowance from a private fund instituted for the benefit of indigent scholars who publicly professed the doctrines of the Reformed faith. After the accession of Mary in 1553 he was expelled by the fellows from the college on account of his opinions, and in a moment of weakness he was induced to sign his adherence to a form of doctrine essentially Romanistic. He, however, speedily repented of his momentary faithlessness to his convictions, and in order to escape the penalties of martyrdom he fled in 1555 to Frankfort, where he publicly abjured his former recantation. On the death of Mary he returned to England. He was one of the learned Protestant doctors appointed to dispute before Elizabeth at Westminster with a like number of Catholics. In the beginning of 1560 he was created bishop of Salisbury, and in the same year he published, with the sanction of the queen and bishops, his Apologia Ecdesiae Anglicanae, which was in fact an argument against the decision of the pope to exclude the Reformers from the council of Trent, convoked to be held in December of that year. The work, as was to be expected, excited very great attention at the time; it was condemned at the meeting of the council, who appointed two divines to reply to its arguments. It was translated into English by Anna, wife of Sir Nicholas Bacon, and Elizabeth ordered that a copy of it should be chained in every parish church in England. Its chief English opponent was Thomas Harding, who in 1565 published a Confutation of the Apology, to which Jewel replied in 1567 by the Defence of the Apology. The general argument of Jewel is that unity or predominance of opinion is not a test of truth, and, although he denied that Rome had the support of the fathers, he rested his general case on the fact that the foundation on which the Church of England was built was not that of the fathers but of the apostles and Jesus Christ. His views were strongly anti-sacramentarian, as he held that the Lord’s Supper had nothing more than a commemorative use. Jewel died suddenly at Monkton Farleigh, a small village in his diocese, September 22, 1571.

Joαηηis Juclli vita ctmors, T. Hurnfrcdo autore, was published at London in 1573. The Apology, translated with notes and life by Isaacson, appeared in 1823, and the other biographies of Jewel are one by Le Bas in the Theological Library, 1835, and a short sketch published by the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge, 1850. His works, which are mostly controversial, were collected by Dr R. W. Jelf, and published in 8 vols, at Oxford, 1848.
