JASHPUR, a tributary state of Chutiâ Nâgpur, Bengal, between 22° 17' 5" and 23° 15' 30" N. lat., and between 83° 32' 50" and 84° 26' 15" E. long., with an area of 1947 square miles, is bounded on the N. and W. by the tributary state of Sargüjâ, on the S. by Gângpur and Udâipur, and on the E. by Lohârdagâ district. The state of Jashpur consists in almost equal proportions of highland and lowland areas. On its eastern side the tableland of the Uparghât (2200 feet above the sea) forms an integral part of the plateau of Chutiâ Nâgpur; towards the west it springs abruptly from the Hetghât, with a wall buttressed at places by projecting masses of rock. The lowlands of Hetghât and of Jashpur proper lie to the south in successive steppes, broken by low hills. The plateau of Khuriâ (3000-3700 feet) occupies the north-west corner of the state. The principal peaks in Jashpur are Rânijulâ (3527 feet), Kohiar (3393 feet), Bharamurio (3390 feet). The chief river is the lb, which flows through the state from north to south; but numerous rapids render it unnavigable. The small rivers to the north are feeders of the Kanhar. Iron and gold are found; sal, sisii, ebony, and other valuable timber trees abound. Lac, i<zsαr-silk, and beeswax, with cereals, oil-seeds, fibres, and cotton are produced. Jashpur, with the rest of the Sargüjâ group of states, was ceded to the British by the provisional engagement concluded with Madhuji Bhonslâ (Apâ Sâhib) in 1818. Although noticed as a separate state, it was at first treated as a fief of Sargüjâ. It is, however, dealt with as a distinct territory.

The chief of Jashpur’s annual income is £2000; the tribute to Government is £77, 10s. The total population in 1872 was 66,926, comprising 34,648 males and 32,278 females,—the Dravidian aborigines numbering 40,935; Kolarian aborigines, 14,070; semi-Hinduized aborigines, 6374; Hindus, 5124; Mahometans, 423. The residence of the râjâ is at Jagdispur or Jashpurnagar.
