JOVINIANUS, or Jovianus, a Roman monk and reputed heretic who flourished during the latter half of the 4th century. All our knowledge of him is derived from a passionately hostile polemic of Jerome {Adv. Jovini-anum Libri ZZ.), written at Bethlehem, and without any personal acquaintance with the man assailed, in 393 a.d. According to this authority he in 388 was living at Rome the celibate life of an ascetic monk, possessed a good acquaintance with Scripture, and was the author of several minor works, but, undergoing an heretical change of view, afterwards became a self-indulgent Epicurean and unrefined sensualist. The doctrinal heresies which had provoked the wrath of Jerome were mainly these :—(1) he held that in point of merit, so far as their domestic state was concerned, virgins, widows, and married persons who had been baptized into Christ were on a precisely equal footing; (2) those who with full faith have been regenerated in baptism cannot be overthrown (or, according to another reading, tempted) of the devil; (3) to abstain from meats is not more praiseworthy than thankfully to enjoy them; (4) all who have preserved their baptismal grace shall receive the same reward in the kingdom of heaven. Jerome’s bitter polemic was chiefly provoked by those views of Jovinian as to fasting and marriage in which the entire Protestant world has declared itself substantially at one with the so-called heretic. He was, however, condemned by a Roman synod under Bishop Siricius in 390, and afterwards excommunicated by another at Milan under the presidency of Ambrose. The year of his death is unknown, but he is referred to as being no longer alive in Jerome’s Contra Vigilantium, which was composed in 406.
