JACOB p⅛2 or ⅛P8ζ derived according to Gen. xxv. 26, xxvii. 36, from 3py, and meaning “one who seizes the heel” or “supplants”), the younger son of Isaac and Rebekah, and the father of the twelve patriarchs. According to the Elohistic (Levitical) narrative in Genesis, he was born in the land of Canaan when his father was sixty years of age. After Esau, his twin brother, at the age of forty years had married two Hittite wives, Isaac at the instigation of Rebekah sent Jacob with his blessing to Padan Aram, there to seek a wife in the family of his maternal uncle Laban. Arrived at his destination, he married Rachel (to whom Bilhah was given as a maidservant); the same narrative implies also his union with Leah (whose maid was Zilpah). Before he left Padan Aram he had become the father of twelve sons, including Benjamin (Gen. xχxv. 23-26). On his return, with the property he had acquired, to his father Isaac in Canaan (xxxi. 18), God met him and blessed him and changed his name from Jacob to Israel; the place where this occurred was called by him Bethel (xxxv. 9-13, XXXV. 15). In the course of a further migration southwards, Rachel died at a point not far from Ephrath (Bethlehem); finally Mamre, near Kirjath Arba (Hebron), where Isaac was living, was reached, and a permanent settlement appears to have been made until the death of Isaac there at the age of one hundred and eighty years. The subsequent migration of Jacob to Egypt with his household of seventy souls is then briefly indicated, and his hospitable reception as an old man of one hundred and thirty by Pharaoh. A residence was assigned to the colony in the best part of the land, the land of Rameses, by Joseph, and here the Israelites prospered much and rapidly increased. Seventeen years after the interview with Pharaoh the patriarch died, after having blessed his sons and particularly Joseph, whose two sons Ephraim and Manasseh he put upon a level with Reuben and Simeon. He was buried by his family, according to his own desire, in the cave of Machpelah, fronting Mamre, in the land of Canaan. The combined parallel narrative of the Jehovist and the other (elder) Elohist is much fuller, and in some points not easily to be reconciled with the preceding account. Various circumstances connected with the birth of the twins Isaac and Jacob are detailed; the partiality of Isaac for the elder and of Rebekah for the younger is indicated; Jacob’s departure from Canaan is represented as a flight necessitated by his fraudulent conduct towards Isaac and Esau with reference to the blessing of the former; a revelation received at Bethel in the course of this flight is described; many minute particulars of his domestic life at Padan Aram and of his relations with Laban his uncle and father-in-law are given; the scene of the change of name is placed at Peniel, where he wrestled with the angel (see Hos. xii. 5); a period of residence at Shechem is mentioned; the death of Rachel at Ephrath is said to have happened in childbed; after having fixed his home successively at Hebron and Beersheba, he is ultimately led by circumstances, which are described with much fulness and vividness, to migrate to Egypt, where he dies. Consideration of the relations of these parallel narratives may be postponed to the article Pentateuch. As to the interpretation of the history of Jacob, it is now usual to regard it as having an ethnological at least quite as much as a personal significance; but none of the attempts hitherto made to mythologize it (as by Popper, who sees in the wrestling Jacob the Asiatic Hercules, Melicertes, Palaemon) can be regarded as even plausible.
