JAPHETH (H£Ç), son of Noah. The most natural rendering of Gen. x. 21 is that which makes Shem the elder brother of Japheth, though the opposite view of the passage in the A. V. follows the Hebrew accents. Interpreters are not agreed whether the sacred text regards Japheth as the second or third son of Noah. In Gen. ix. 24 “youngest” is an easier rendering than “younger,” but the name of Ham is always placed between those of his brothers. The whole Biblical importance of the sons of Noah is geographical or ethnographical; even in the narrative of Gen. ix. 20-27 the point lies in the blessings assigned to the nations or groups of nations named after each. The distribution of the Japhetic group is sketched in Gen. x. 2-4 from the geographical standpoint of the Levitical narrator, that is, according to the most recent criticism, of the 6th century b.c. The seven sons of Japheth are the nations lying north of the Semitic group or westward across the Mediterranean. The details are in part obscure. Madai certainly means the Medians and Javan the Ionians, but in our passage the latter name is used in an extended sense, not so much for the Greeks proper—a common Eastern usage of the word—as for the inhabitants of the trading ports and coast-lands of the Mediterranean known to Phoenician commerce. Thus Javan includes Elishah (probably Carthage), Tarshish (Tartessus in Spain), Kittim (Cyprus), and Dodanim, for which we must rather read Rodanim (Rhodes), with the LXX. in our passage and the Hebrew of 1 Chron. i. 7. Tubal and Meshech appear in Ezek. xxvii. 13 as associated with Javan in exporting slaves and bronze to Tyre, and the same nations along with Gomer occur in Ezek. xxxviii. in the great army of Magog which issues from the “extreme north” (A. V. “north quarters,” vv. 6, 15). Magog in fact means the Scythians, and whatever doubt there may be as to the identification of the associated names (Gomer, Cimmerians or Cappadocians, with the subdivisions Ascanians, Paphlagonians, and perhaps Teuthranians; Tubal, Tibareni; Meshech, Moschi), the whole group appears to be connected with the shores of the Black Sea or to be known from Phoenician voyages in that direction. The seventh son Tiras is quite unidentified; Thracians and Tyrsenians are mere guesses. The wide range of the Japhetic lands sufficiently explains the blessing in Gen. ix. 27, “May God enlarge Japheth.” In the succeeding clause, “and let him dwell in the tents of Shem” it is disputed whether the subject is God or Japheth. In the latter case the allusion must be to friendly intercommunication and common settlements on equal terms, in contrast to the position of the subjugated Hamites (Canaan) under the lordship of the victorious Semites (Israel). The precise point of view from which the northern nations, and particularly those over the sea (Gen. x. 5), came to be grouped as sons of Japheth is the more obscure because the etymology of the name is quite uncertain. The resemblance in sound to the Greek Iapetos has been often noticed, but leads to nothing.
