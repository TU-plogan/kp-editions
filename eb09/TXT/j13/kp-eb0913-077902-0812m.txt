JUNOT, LaurePermon (1784-1838), Duchesse d’Abrantès, was born at Montpellier, 6th November 1784. Her father was an army contractor, who allowed his wife to take his daughters to Paris in order that they might make good matches. They were lively, witty young ladies, and soon attracted to their hotel a mixed society of officers. Madame Junot declared that Napoleon wished to marry her mother; but there is no evidence for the truth of the story. But he gave Laure Permon 100,000 francs when she married Junot, and after the birth of her first child a house in the Champs-Élysées, with 100,000 francs to furnish it. Her husband had extravagant tastes; but she was extravagant to recklessness, contracting debts as rapidly as tradesmen would allow her to run them up. In 1805 she went with her husband to Lisbon, and, as she took it on her to represent “female France,” her train was more expensive than that of a queen. After she returned to Paris, she renewed her extravagance, and, opening her drawing-room to the older families as well as to the new men of the empire, she fell under suspicion. With Junot she went through the Spanish campaign, and contrived to give pleasant balls and to hold drawing-rooms all along the route. After her husband’s death she was forbidden to return to Paris, but she ignored Napoleon’s order, returned, opened her house again, and attracted to it all the celebrities of the day. Her poverty compelled her to retire to L’Abbaye-aux-Bois when the empire ended; but she devoted herself to literature with much zeal. She made social recollections from her own life her chief subject; her style was free and flowing; and her articles, memoirs, and romances were widely read. She died at Paris, 7th June 1838.
