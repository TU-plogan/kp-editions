JAUHARY. Abu Nasr Isrna'il ibn Harnrnâd el-Jauhary of Fârâb, a district beyond the Jaxartes, on the borders of Turkestan, is one of the fathers of Arabic lexicography. After the fashion of the older Arabic philologers he completed his studies by a residence among the tribes of the Arabian desert, and finally established himself at Naisâpûr, where he died by a fall from the roof of his house, leaving the revision of his great lexicon, the Sihäh fi ’ l-Lugha, incomplete. According to some accounts he committed suicide in a fit of insanity. Hajji Khalifa (iv. 91) places his death 303 a.h. (1002-3 a.d.) ; others give 398 or 400.

The Sihàh has been repeatedly printed in the East, as at Bûlak 1282 (1865), and again in 1875. Of the edition projected by Ev. Scheidius, only one part appeared in 1776. See Hamaker, Spec. Cat., p. 48; Dozy, Leyden Catalogue, i. 67; Pertsch, Gotha Cat., No. 378; H. Khalifa, ui supra.
