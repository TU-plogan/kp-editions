JOSIAH, the last but four of the kings of Judah, was the son of Amon, whom he succeeded when only eight years old, the people having declared in his favour against the conspirators who had murdered his unworthy father. The circumstances of the regency which must have existed during his minority are not recorded; it is not until his eighteenth year (for 2 Chr. xxxiv. 3 cannot be set against the explicit testimony of 2 Kings xxii., xxiii.) that he emerges into the light of history, when we find him interested in the repair of the temple at Jerusalem. The religious movement of which this was a symptom took more definite shape with the finding by Hilkiah the high priest of a copy of “the book of the law.” The reasons for believing this to have been (substantially at least) the book of Deuteronomy cannot be detailed here. They were already appreciated by Jerome and Chrysostom, and no very careful examination is required to show that the effect of its perusal was to bring about a religious reformation, which in all its features was in accordance with the prescriptions and exhortations of that remarkable composition. The main features of the movement (which extended into the adjoining kingdom of Samaria, at that time a loosely governed Assyrian dependency) have already been sketched in the article Israel. On the secular aspects of the reign of Josiah Scripture is almost wholly silent. Thus nothing is related of the great Scythian invasion, which as we know from Herodotus (i. 105) took place at this period, and must have approached Judah, being probably alluded to by Zephaniah and Jeremiah. The storm which shook the great world powers was favourable to the peace of Josiah’s kingdom; the power of Assyria was practically broken, and that of the Chaldeans had not yet developed itself into the aggressive forms it afterwards assumed. But in his thirty-first year Josiah for some unexplained reason was rash enough to place himself in the path of Pharaoh Necho in his military expedition against the king of Assyria; a disastrous encounter took place at Megiddo, in which he lost at once his crown and life (aet. 39).
