JEFFERSONVILLE, the county seat of Clark county, Indiana, U.S., is situated on the north bank of the Ohio river. The streets are of a uniform width of 60 feet. The falls of the Ohio afford a fine water-power, so that manufactories are numerous. Among them are locomotive and car works, plate-glass works, two ship-yards, and railway machine shops. The southern State penitentiary and an extensive Government dépôt of army supplies are situated here. Population in 1880, 9357.
