JOUVENET, Jean (1647-1717), born at Rouen in 1647, came of a family of painters, one of whom had had the honour of teaching Poussin. He early showed remarkable aptitude for his profession, and, on arriving in Paris, attracted the attention of Le Brun, by whom he was employed at Versailles, and under whose auspices, in 1675, he became a member of the Royal Academy, of which he was elected professor in 1681, and one of the four perpetual rectors in 1707. The great mass of works that he executed, chiefly in Paris, many of which, including his celebrated Miraculous Draught of Fishes (engraved by Audran; also Landon, Annales, i. p. 42), are now in the Louvre, show his fertility in invention and execution, and also that he possessed in a high degree that general dignity of arrangement and style which distinguished the school of Le Brun. Jouvenet died on April 5, 1717, having been forced by paralysis during the last four years of his life to work with his left hand. See Hem. Iηed. Acad. Roy. de P. et de Sc., 1854, and D’Argenville, Vies des Peintres.
