JAMRUD, a ruined fort in Pesh<4war district, Punjab, India, situated in 34° N. lat. and 71° 24' E. long., at the mouth of the Khyber Pass, 1670 feet above sea-level. It was occupied by Hari Sinh, Ranjit Sinh’s commander, in 1836; but in April 1837 Dost Muhammad sent a body of Afghans to attack it. A battle ensued, in which the Sikhs gained a doubtful victory, with the loss of their general, Hari Sinh. During the military operations of 1878-79 Jamπid became a place of considerable importance as the frontier outpost on British territory towards Afghanistan.
