JOHN IV. (1603-1656), “the Fortunate,” of Portugal, was born at Villaviciosa in March 1603, succeeded to the dukedom of Braganza in 1630, and married Luisa de Guzman, eldest daughter of the duke of Medina Sidonia, in 1633. By the unanimous voice of the people he was raised to the throne of Portugal (of which he was held to be the legitimate heir) at the revolution effected in December 1640 by a conspiracy of the nobles against the grievances inflicted by Spain and the insolence of Philip IV.’s minister, the duke of Olivarez. His accession ultimately led to a protracted war with Spain, of which the final issue—the recognized independence of Portugal—did not declare itself until a subsequent reign (1668). He died after a prosperous reign of sixteen years, on November 6, 1656, and was succeeded by his son Alphonso VI.
