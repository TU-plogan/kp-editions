JOHN (1801-1873), king of Saxony, brother and successor of Frederick Augustus II., and younger son of Duke Maximilian and Caroline of Parma, was born at Dresden 12th December 1801. In youth he showed a special bent towards mathematics, and he also studied with great diligence law and history. His interest in Italian literature having been awakened by a journey to Italy in 1821, he in 1825 printed for private circulation, under the pseudonym of Philalethes, a metrical translation of a portion of Dante’s Inferno, and in 1829 he published a complete translation of the Divine Comedy, with critical and historical notes. At an early age he also took an active part in political life. In 1821 he became a member of the college of finance, of which he was president from 1825 to 1831. From 1831 to 1846 he acted as commander of the national guards. On ascending the throne in 1854 he followed the same enlightened and liberal policy as his brother, and introduced several reforms of great benefit to the country. In the wars of 1866 he sided with Austria against Prussia, and on that account had to submit to the payment of a large sum of money and the cession of the fortress of Königstein at the conclusion of peace. He, however, afterwards entered the North German federation, and his troops took a very prominent and distinguished part in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71. He died at Dresden, October 29, 1873.
