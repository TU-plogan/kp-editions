JOHN XV. (pope from 985 to 996) is now generally recognized as the successor of Boniface VII., the pope of the same name who was said to have ruled for four months after the murder of Boniface being now omitted by the best authorities. John XV. was the son of Leo, a presbyter in Gallina Alba. At the time he mounted the papal chair Crescentius was patrician of Rome, but, although his influence was on this account very much hampered, the presence of the empress Theophania in Rome from 989 to 991 restrained also the ambition of Crescentius. On her departure the pope, whose venality and nepotism had made him very unpopular with the citizens, found it necessary to flee to Tuscany. The news of the approach of Otho III. made it possible for him soon afterwards to return, but he died of fever before the arrival of Otho, who elevated his own kinsman Bruno to the papal dignity under the name of Gregory V.
