JAMES (’Ιάκωβος). This name, the Hebrew Yakob or Jacob, belongs to several persons mentioned in the New Testament, of whom the first that appears in the Gospels is

1. James the son of Zebedee. He was among the first who were called to be Christ’s immediate followers and afterwards chosen to be his apostles, and is one—the others being Peter, Andrew, and John (the brother of James)—of the always first-mentioned and, as the narrative shows, most remarkable group of the apostolic band. In all the enumerations of the twelve (Matt. x. 2; Mark iii. 17; Luke vi. 14; Acts i. 13), his name appears early in the list, twice occupying the second place after Peter’s. The call of James and John (the fullest account of which is given in Luke v. 1-11; comp. Mark i. 20) took place on the same occasion when Peter and Andrew, the other pair of brothers, were taken from their humble fisher’s trade to be fishers of men. After this we next find James noticed as one of the persons present (Mark i. 29) when Jesus restored Simon Peter’s wife’s mother, who was sick of a fever.

His brother and he were surnamed by our Lord (Mark iii. 17) “Boanerges,” a name derived from two Aramaic words signifying “Sons of thunder,” as it is interpreted by the evangelist. The name has been explained as having reference to the powers of their eloquence in preaching, or even from their being present when the voice like thunder spake to Jesus from the cloud (John xii. 29). It is more probable, especially as one meaning of the word translated “thunder” is “rage, anger,” that the name was given to them by the Lord because he perceived the fiery impetuosity of their nature. Two instances (Luke ix. 54; Mark x. 32-41) are recorded in the Gospels from which we can discern somewhat of this character of the sons of Zebedee.

James is included among those who after the ascension waited at Jerusalem (Acts i. 13) for the descent of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost. This is one of the passages in which the name of James is placed before those of John and Andrew, and we may judge from the little that we are told of him subsequently that he was a most zealous and prominent member of the Christian community. For when a victim is to be chosen from among the apostles who should be sacrificed to the animosity of the Jews, it is on James that the blow falls first. The brief notice is given Acts xii. 1, 2: “Now about that time Herod [Agrippa I.] the king put forth his hands to afflict certain of the church. And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.”

Eusebius (∕∕. E., ii. 9) has preserved for us from •Clement of Alexandria the circumstance that the accuser of the apostle, “beholding his confession and moved thereby, confessed that he too was a Christian. So they were both led away to execution together, and on the road the accuser asked James for forgiveness. Gazing on him for a little while, he said, i Peace be with thee,’ and kissed him. And then both were beheaded together.” Other legends which tell of the apostle’s preaching in Spain, and of the translation of his body to Compostella, are to be found in the Acta Sanctorum, July 25 (vol. vi. pp. 1-124),

2. James the son of Alphaeus. He also was one of the apostles, and is mentioned in all the four lists (Matt. x. 3; Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. 15; Acts i. 13) by this name, but in no other place. It is, however, thought by some that he is the same with

3. James the Lords brother. In Matt. xiii. 55 and Mark vi. 3 the brethren of the Lord are named James, Joses, Judas, and Simon. It is also to be remarked that they are in both places spoken of as the children of the carpenter, that is, of Joseph the husband of the Virgin Mary. But it has been urged that they were called sons of Joseph and Mary because the children of two families,— of Mary the Virgin and Mary the wife of Clopas, her half sister,—were brought up together. Those who in this way make James the Lord’s brother to be a son of Alphaeus require to establish (a) that Clopas is the same name as Alphaeus, (δ) that Mary the wife of Clopas (John xix. 25) was the sister of the Virgin Mary, and (c) that this Mary, wife of Clopas, is the same who is called (Matt, xxvi. 56; Mark xv. 40) Mary the mother of James and Joses, and (Mark. xvi. 1; Luke xxiv. 10) simply the mother of James, in which four passages the same person is evidently intended. But the identity of the names Alphaeus and Clopas is by no means certain. Those who maintain it take Clopas as the Aramaic Chalpai, and Alphaeus to be a Graecized form thereof. But when we turn to what might be supposed the best source of evidence on this point, viz., the Peshito version of the New Testament, instead of finding the two names treated as the same word, we find in all cases Chalpai where the Greek has Alphaeus, and where Clopas or Cleopas occurs, it is simply transliterated Kleopha. The same is the case with the Jerusalem Syriac. The identity of these names is thus far from being established. Then in John xix. 25 the versions and best authorities are in favour of making four persons of those there mentioned: “his mother, and his mother’s sister, and Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.” This is the Peshito rendering, and, even if the conjunction were not there, it is not uncommon in Scriptural enumeration to find names given in pairs without any conjunction, while to make Mary the wife of Clopas the Virgin’s sister would be to assume two Maries in the same family of sisters, which is not very probable. Whether Mary wife of Clopas was the mother of a James (called in one place “the little ”) and of Joses can neither be asserted nor denied from the evidence in the Gospels; but, when the other two assumptions have so little foundation to rest on, it seems impossible to consider the son of Alphaeus the same person with the “brother of the Lord.”

Further, James the Lord’s brother was bishop of Jerusalem (comp. Gal. i. 19 with Gal. ii. 9-12), and was president of the church in its earliest days (Acts xii. 17, xv. 13, xxi. 18). Such a position required him to be a resident in Jerusalem, while had he been an apostle (as the son of Alphaeus was) we should have expected him to take his share of the missionary labour of publishing the gospel in distant lands. But this bishop of Jerusalem was the author of the epistle of St James. He simply styles himself in the introduction thereto “a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ.” He who could thus write with the certainty of being identified must have been the most famous person of his name in the church, must have been what St Paul, in a passage (Gal. ii. 9) where he places James before both Peter and John, calls him, “a pillar” of the Christian society. And again Jude, when commencing his epistle, calls himself the brother of James, with no other mark of distinction. Here too the same [9:13:553] James must be intended, and when we read St Jude’s epistle (17, 18) we find him distinguishing himself from the apostles, and as it were disclaiming the apostolic dignity. This is as it would be if James and Jude were both brethren of the Lord and were not apostles, but we should certainly expect one or other would have left some indication in their letters had they been of the number of the twelve, and most surely neither of them would have been likely to give us reason for believing that he was not an apostle.

Tlιe two passages (1 Cor. xv. 7; Gal. i. 19) from which it might be argued that James the brother of the Lord was an apostle cannot be relied on, for we find the same title given to Barnabas, and it is certain that the name “apostle” began to be more widely applied after the ascension than it is in the Gospels.

Once more, the brethren of the Lord are expressly said (John vii. 5) not to have believed on Jesus at a period much later in his ministry than the appointment of the twelve; while in the mention of them in Acts i. 14 there is given first a list of the eleven, who are said all to have “continued in prayer with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with his brethren.” Such a studied severance of the brethren of the Lord from the number of the apostles is very significant, while the position which they hold in the list may well be due to the fact that it was only at a late period that they had become disciples of Jesus. The change in their opinions has been thought by many to be sufficiently accounted for by the statement of St Paul (1 Cor. XV. 7) that after his resurrection Jesus “was seen of Janies.” Such a demonstration of the truth of what others had long believed and Jesus himself had taught could not fail to work conviction on a mind which, if we may accept the tradition of the “Gospel according to the Hebrews ' r (which also testifies to this appearance of Christ to James), was somewhat inclined to believe, even before the crucifixion.

It seems right therefore to conclude that James the son of Alphaeus, one of the apostles, was a different person from James the Lord’s brother and bishop of Jerusalem. Of the history of the former we are told nothing except that he was an apostle. The latter is spoken of by St Peter (Acts xii. 17) as if he were at that time the recognized head of the Christian community in Jerusalem. Again (Acts XV. 13), after the debate at Jerusalem about the circumcision of the Gentiles, it is he who sums up the arguments and declares the sentence of the council, as if he were the chief person among them. In Acts xxi. 18, on St Paul’s last visit to Jerusalem, he holds the same position, and receives the visit of St Paul in the presence of all the presbyters. In Gal. i. 19, ii. 9 he is placed foremost among “the pillars” of the church of Jerusalem.

From the New Testament we learn no more of the history of James the Lord’s brother, but Eusebius (H. E., ii. 23) has preserved for us from Hegesippus the earliest ecclesiastical traditions concerning him. By that authority he is described as having been a Nazarite, and on account of his eminent righteousness called “Just” and “Oblias.” So great was his influence with the people that he was appealed to by the scribes and Pharisees for a true and (as they hoped) unfavourable judgment about the Messiahship of Christ. Placed, to give the greater publicity to his words, on a pinnacle of the temple, he, when solemnly appealed to, made confession of his faith, and was at once thrown down and murdered. This happened immediately before the siege. Josephus (Antiq., xx. 9, 1) tells that it was by order of Ananus the high priest, in the interval between the death of Festus and the arrival of his successor Albinus, that James was put to death; and his narrative gives the idea of some sort of judicial examination, for he says that along with some others James was brought before an assembly of judges, by whom they were condemned and delivered to be stoned.^[1. For a discussion of these traditions, and on the question whether the text of Josephus is interpolated, consult Credner, Einleitung, p. 581; Hilgenfeld, Einl., p. 523 seq. ; Wieseler in Jahτb. f. D. Theol., 1878, p. 99 seq. Compare also Jerome’s account of James in his book De vir. ilk, 2, where further traditions from the Gospel according to the Hebrews are given. ]

Other less important bearers of this name are (4) James, of whom all we know is that he was the “son of Mary” (Matt, xxviii. 56; Mark xv. 40, xvi. 1; Luke xxiv. 10) and the brother of a certain Joses (comp. Mark xv. 40 with xvi. 1), and that he is called “the little,” ό μικρός (A. V. “the less,” wrongly); and (5) James, who was either the father or brother of Judas, one of the apostles. The Greek gives (Luke vi. 16; Acts i. 13) “Judas of James.” The ellipsis may, as has been shown by Winer, be supplied either by the word “father” or “brother.” The A. V. supplies “brother.” But, as in both these lists within a line of the name of this Judas a similar form “James of Alphaeus” occurs, which is in both places rendered James the “son” of Alphaeus, as it is also in both the other lists of the apostles in St Matthew and St Mark, it seems natural to suppose that the evangelists intended the same noun to be supplied in both cases. If this be so, the James here mentioned would be a person otherwise unknown, but the father of the apostle Judas, who is distinguished as Lebbaeus and Thaddens, and also by St John (xiv. 22) as “Judas not Iscariot.”
