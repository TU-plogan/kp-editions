JAMES, John Angell (1785-1859), preacher and author, was born at Blandford, Dorsetshire, June 6, 1785. After obtaining at school a knowledge of reading, writing, ciphering, and a little Latin, he was at the age of thirteen bound to a seven years’ apprenticeship with a linendraper at Poole, with the view of assisting his father in his business at Blandford; but about the close of his term of apprenticeship he began to form the resolution of becoming a preacher, and in 1802 he went to prosecute his studies at the theological college of Gosport. After remaining there for a year and a half, he happened to pay a visit to Birmingham, where his preaching was so highly esteemed by the congregation of Carr’s Lane Independent chapel that they invited him to “exercise his ministry amongst them,” and accordingly, after finishing his short theological course, he was settled there in the beginning of September 1805, and ordained on the 8th May of the following year. For seven years his success as a preacher was comparatively small, but about 1814 his eloquence almost suddenly acquired for him a popularity which attracted large crowds wherever he officiated in England, and never faded during the long term of his subsequent ministry. At the same time his numerous religious writings, the best known of which are The Anxious Inquirer and An Earnest Ministry, acquired a wide circulation both in England and in America. He died at Birmingham [9:13:562] October 2, 1859. The degree of D.D. was conferred on James by the college of Princeton, New Jersey, and also by the university of Glasgow.

A collected edition of James’s works appeared in 1860-64. See A Revieιv of the Life and Character of J. Angell James, by J. Campbell, 1860; True Greatness, a brief Memoir of J. A. James, 1860; and Life and Letters of J. A. James, edited by B. W. Dale.
