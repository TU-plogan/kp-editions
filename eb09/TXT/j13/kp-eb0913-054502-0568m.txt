JÁISALMIR, a native state in Râjputâna, under the political superintendence of that agency and the Government of India, lying between 26° 5' and 28° 24' N. lat. and between 69° 30' and 72° 50' E. long., with an area of 16,447 square miles, is bounded on the N. by Bahâwalpur, on the E. by Bikaner and Jodhpur, on the S. by Jodhpur and Sind, and on the W. by Khairpur state and Sind.

Jâisalmir is almost entirely a sandy waste, forming a part of “the Great Indian Desert.” The general aspect of the country is that of an interminable sea of sandhills, of all shapes and sizes, some rising to a height of 150 feet. Those in the west are covered with phog bushes, those in the east with tufts of long grass. Water is scarce, and generally brackish; the average depth of the wells is said to be about 250 feet. There are no perennial streams, and only one small river, the Kakni, which, after flowing a distance of 28 miles, spreads over a large surface of flat ground, and forms a lake or jhil called the Bhuj-Jhil. The climate is essentially dry and healthy. The temperature is highest in May and J une; the coldest months are from the middle of December to the middle of February. Throughout Jâisalmir, only rain-crops, such as lajra, jodr, moth, Cd, <fcc., are grown; spring crops of wheat, barley, &c., are very rare. Owing to the scanty rainfall, irrigation is almost unknown.

The main part of the population lead a wandering life, grazing their flocks and herds. Large herds of camels, horned cattle, sheep, and goats are kept. The principal trade is in wool, ghi, camels, cattle, and sheep. The chief imports are grain, sugar, foreign cloth, piece-goods, &c. There is only one civil court. -Education is at a very low ebb. Jain priests are the chief schoolmasters, and their teaching is very elementary. The income of the state for 1873-74 was £11,854, the expenditure £15,911. The mahârâwal has a force of 651 infantry and 155 cavalry, who have no drill or discipline, but are very efficient as police. It has been estimated that the total number of inhabitants does not exceed 72,000; 43,500 are said to be Hindus, 26,000 Mahometans, and 2500 Jains.

The majority of the inhabitants are Yadu Bhati Rajputs, who take their name from an ancestor named Bhati, renowned as a warrior, when the tribe were located in the Punjab. Shortly after this the clan was driven southwards, and found a refuge in the Indian desert, which was thenceforth their home. Deoraj, a famous prince of the Bhati family, is esteemed the real founder of the present Jaisalmir dynasty, and with him the title of rdwαl commenced. In 1156 Jaisal, the sixth in succession from Deoraj, founded the fort and city of Jaisalmir, and made it his capital. Jâisal was succeeded by several warlike princes, who were constantly engaged in battles and raids. In 1294 the Bhatis so enraged the emperor Alä-ud-din that his army captured and sacked the fort and city of Jaisalmir, so that for some time it was quite deserted. After this there is nothing to record till the time of Räwal Sabal Sinh, whose reign marks an epoch in Bhati history in that he acknowledged the supremacy of the Delhi emperor Shah Jahan, and was the first of the Jaisalmir princes who held his dominions as a fief of the Delhi empire. The Jaisalmir princes had now arrived at the height of their power, but from this time till the accession of Räwal Mulraj in 1762 the fortunes of the state rapidly declined, and most of its outlying provinces were lost. In 1818 Mulraj entered into political relations with the British. Since his death in 1820, no stirring events have occurred. The present chief is Mahârâwal Bairi Sal, who was born in 1848, and is a Yadu Bhati Rajput. The ruler of Jâisalmir is styled mahârâwal, and holds that position as head of the clan of Bhatis. The constitution may be described as tribal suzerainty in process of conversion to the feudal stage. Many of the tribal chiefs are to a great extent independent, insomuch that they hold their estates rent free.
