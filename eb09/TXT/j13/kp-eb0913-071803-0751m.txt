JOHN, St, of Nepomuk, or Pomuk (c. 1330-1393), the patron saint of Bohemia, was born at Pomuk about 1330. After studying at the university of Prague he took holy orders and was for some time a priest in the diocese of Prague. In 1372 he is mentioned as imperial notary; in 1380 he became rector of the church of St Gall in Prague, and notary and secretary of the archbishop; and in 1381 he was made doctor of canon law and canon of the metropolitan chapter. He appears to have taken an important part as adviser or supporter of the archbishop John of Jansteinin his disputes with King Wenceslaus, and on this account, after suffering cruel torture, he was drowned in the Moldau. The chief events of his life were afterwards adorned with a variety of legends, and in 1729 he was canonized by Benedict XIII. An annual procession in his honour takes place at Prague on May 16.
