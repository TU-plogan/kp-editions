JACKSONVILLE, the chief city in Duval county, Florida, U.S., and the largest in the State, is situated on the west bank of the St Johnâ€™s river, 25 miles from the sea. The city is regularly built.. The streets, many of which are pleasantly shaded with trees, are laid out on the common American rectangular system. Jacksonville exports very large quantities of lumber, besides fruit, cotton, sugar, and fish, and carries on a coasting trade with Charleston, Savannah, and St Augustine. The fine salubrious climate attracts numerous visitors and invalids from the northern States. Jacksonville, which owes its name to President Jackson was laid out as a town in 1822. In 1880 its population was 7650.
