JAMES, or, in full, James Frederick Edward Stuart (1688-1766), prince of Wales, called by his adherents James III. of England, but better known as the Pretender, was the son of James II. and Mary of Modena, and was born in St James’s Palace, London, June 10th 1688. The general opinion prevailing at the time of his birth that he was a supposititious child seemed to be confirmed by a variety of circumstances, but it has been completely overthrown by undoubted facts. Shortly before the flight of the king to Sheerness, the infant prince along with his mother was sent to France, and afterwards he continued to reside with his father at the court of St Germain. On the death of his father he was immediately proclaimed king by Louis XIV. of France, but a fantastic attempt to perform a similar ceremony in London so roused the anger of the populace that the mock pursuivants barely escaped with their lives. A bill of attainder against him received the royal assent a few days before the death of William

III. in 1702, and the Princess Anne, half-sister of the Pretender, succeeded William on the throne. An influential party still, however, continued to adhere to the Jacobite cause; and an expedition planned in favour of James failed of success chiefly in all probability because his falling ill of measles, on the eve of its departure, enabled the English to assemble so powerful a fleet as rendered disembarkation inadvisable. A rebellion in the Highlands of Scotland was inaugurated in September 1715 by the raising of the standard “on the braes of Mar,” and the solemn proclamation of James Stuart, “the Chevalier of St George,” in the midst of the assembled clans, but its progress was arrested in November by the indecisive battle of Sheriffmuir, and it was practically extinguished a few weeks afterwards by the surrender at Preston. Unaware of the gloomy nature of his prospects, the Chevalier landed in December at Peterhead, and advanced as far south as Scone, accompanied by a small force under the earl of Mar; but, on learning of the approach of the duke of Argyle, he retreated to Montrose, where the Highlanders dispersed to the [9:13:561] mountains, and he embarked again for France. A Spanish expedition sent out in his behalf in 1718 under the direction of Alberoni was scattered by a tempest, only two frigates reaching the appointed rendezvous in the island of Lewis. In 1719 James was married at Avignon to the Princess Clementina of Poland, by whom he had two sons, Charles Edward, and Henry, afterwards Cardinal York. His licentious habits soon led to a separation from his wife, and his indolence and irresolution having completely unfitted him for the role of aspirant to the English throne, the hopes and affections of his adherents were gradually transferred to his son Charles Edward, of whose career an account is given in vol. v. p. 426-7. James spent the remainder of his years at Rome, where he was regarded with very little esteem both by the pope and the populace. The papal soldiers mounted guard at the Palazzo Muti, where he resided, and the pope issued an order that he should be styled king of England, but the Italians were in the habit of naming him the king here in contradistinc- ' tion to the king there, that is, in England. Latterly his regular income was 12,000 scudi from the pope, which’ only was supplemented by the donations, probably not very large, of the adherents of the cause in England. Horace Walpole, writing in 1752, thus describes him, “He is tall, meagre, and melancholy of aspect. Enthusiasm and disappointment have stamped a solemnity on his person which rather awakens pity than respect. He seems the phantom which good nature divested of reflexion conjures up when we think of the misfortunes without the demerits of Charles the First. Without the particular features of any Stuart, the Chevalier has the strong lines and fatality of air peculiar to them all.” For several of the last years of his life the Chevalier was so infirm in health that he was unable to leave his bed-chamber. He died at Rome, January 12, 1766, and was interred in the church of St Peter’s.

The Jacobite cause in Scotland has given rise to some of the finest specimens of national ballad literature. Two volumes of Jacobite Relics were published in 1819-1821, but the collection is very miscellaneous. An edition of Jacobite songs appeared at Glasgow in 1829, and a more complete collection was published in 1861, edited by Charles Mackay. See History of the Jacobite Club, London, 1712; Secret Memoirs of Bar-le·dnc, 1716; Macpherson’s Original Papers; The Decline of the Last Stuarts, printed for the Roxburghe Club, 1843; Chambers’s History of the Rebellion, 1824; Jesse, The Pretenders and their Adherents, 1858; Thackeray, Henry Esmond; Debrosse, L' Italie il y a Cent Ans, 18∙36; Lacroix de Mariés, Histoire du Chevalier de Sahηt-Gcorges et du Prince Charles Edouard, 1868 and 1876; Doran, Mann and Manners at the Court of Florence, 1875; Id., London in the Jacobite Times, 1877.
