JHANG, a British district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, India, between 30° 35' and 32° 4' N. lat., and between 71° 39' and 73° 38' E. long., with an area of 5712 square miles. It forms the northern district of the Mùltân division, and is bounded on the N. by Shâhpur and Gujrânwâla, on the W. by Derâ Ismâil Khân, and on the S.E. by Montgomery. It comprises an irregular triangle, artificially constituted for administrative purposes from portions of three separate tracts. Its eastern half embraces a large part of the high dorsal bridge in the Rechna Doâb; thence it stretches across the Chenab into the wedge of land between that stream and the Jhélum, whose waters unite a few miles below the town of Jhang; while westward again the boundary runs beyond the joint river, far into the heart of the Sind Sâgar Doâb. The Ravi also bounds the district for a few miles along its southern edge. So artificial a tract can hardly be said to possess any common natural features of its own. Along the banks of the river strips of comparatively fertile lowland support a dense population.

At the census of 1868 the population was 348,027 (193,624 males and 154,403 females). The Mahometans numbered 270,819; Hindus, 57,297; Sikhs, 2994; and “others,” 16,917. Only three towns contain a population exceeding 5000—Jhang, 9124; Maghiâna, 10,525; and Chiniot, 11,477. The area under cultivation in 1873 amounted to 241,325 acres, out of an assessed total of 3,650,867 acres. No crops can anywhere be grown without irrigation. Wheat, barley, gram, sarsοη, china, joâr, maize, and cotton form the staples of the district. Grain is imported. Country cloth is manufactured at Jhang and Maghiâna, and bought up by the Po-winda merchants of Afghanistan. Manufactures of gold and silver lace also exist. The principal road from Mùltân to Wazirâbâd passes through the chief towns in the district. A bridge of boats is in course of construction (1875) across the united stream of the Jhelum and the Chenâb. Both rivers are navigable. The total revenue for 1873 was £49,302. The police force in 1872 numbered 503 mem In 1872 there were 32 Government and 123 native schools, with a joint roll of 3696 pupils. The district bears a good reputation for healthiness. Small-pox and fever form the most prevalent diseases. The average rainfall for the seven years ending 1872-73 was 10 inches. There are seven charitable dispensaries.

The district of Jhang possesses unusual historical interest from the presence within its borders of the rains which crown the rocky eminence of Sanglawala Tiba. This site has been identified with the Sakala of the Brahmans, the Sagal of Buddhism, and the Sangala of Alexander’s historians. In modern times the history of Jhang centres in the famous family of Sials, who exercised an extensive sway over a large tract between Shahpur and Mιiltan, with little dependence on the imperial court at Delhi, until they finally fell before the all-absorbing power of Ranjit. Sinh. The Sials of Jhang are Mahometans of Rajput descent, whose ancestor, Rai Shankar of Dâranagar, emigrated early in the 13th century from the Gangetic Doâb to Jaunpur. In the beginning of the present century "the maharaja Ranjιt Sinh invaded Jhang, and captured the Sial chieftain’s territories. He recovered a small portion afterwards, which he λvas allowed to retain on payment of a yearly tribute. In 1847, after the establishment of the British agency at Lahore, the district came under the charge of the British Government; and in 1848 Ismail Khan, the Sial leader, rendered important services against the rebel chiefs, for which he received a pension. During the mutiny of 1857 the Sial leader again proved his loyalty by serving in person on the British side. His pension was afterwards increased, and he obtained the title of Khan Bahadur, with a small jdgir îoi life.

Jhang, a municipal town in the above district. The sister town of Maghiâna, containing the civil station for the district, lies 3 miles south of Jhang, and has a population of 10,525 persons. They form together a single municipality, and may be regarded as practically one town, situated in 31° 16' 16" N. lat., and 72° 21' 45" E. long., about 3⅛ miles to the west of the present bed of the Chenab. Jhang itself lies on the lowland, a little apart from the regular lines of trade, and since the removal of the Government offices to Maghiâna, has yielded its commerce and importance to its younger rival. Founded by Mal Khân, a Siâl chieftain, in 1462, it long formed the capital of a native Mahometan state. The population of Jhang proper in 1868 was 9124, comprising 4568 Hindus, 4244 Mahometans, 129 Sikhs, 12 Christians, and 171 “others.” Population of the united towns, 19,649.
