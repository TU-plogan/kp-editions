YELETS, a district town of the Russian government of Orel, 121 miles by rail to the east of Orel, stands on the great trunk railway which connects Riga with Tsaritsyn on the lower Volga; a branch line connects it also with the railway which runs from Tula to Samara and Orenburg. Owing to its advantageous position Yelets, which had been for a long time an important entrep√¥t for the corn trade, has rapidly grown of late, and in 1883 had 36,680 inhabitants. The Yelets merchants buy large quantities of grain in the fertile neighbouring provinces, and send their agents to southern and south-eastern Russia; nearly 150 flour-mills, many of them driven by steam, prepare flour, which is forwarded chiefly to Moscow and partly to Riga. The trade in cattle is also very important. Yelets has become of late a manufacturing centre, and has some important tanneries, foundries for cast-iron and copper, tallowmelting works, sieve manufactories, &c. The town has several educational institutions. Its cathedral and two monasteries contain venerated historic relics.

Yelets is first mentioned in 1147, when it was a fort of Ryazan. The Polovtsys attacked it in the 12th century, and the Mongols destroyed it during their first invasion. The Tartars plundered it in 1415 and 1450; and it seems to have been completely abandoned in the latter half of the 15th century. Its development dates from the second half of the 17th century, when it became a centre for the trade with south Russia.
