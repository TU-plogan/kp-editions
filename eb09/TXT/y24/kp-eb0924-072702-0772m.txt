YAM, a term usually applied to the tubers of various species of Dioscorea. These are plants with thick rootstocks, from which protrude long slender, climbing stems, bearing alternate or opposite, entire or lobed leaves and unisexual flowers in long clusters. The flowers are generally small and individually inconspicuous, though collectively showy. Each consists of a greenish bell-shaped or flat perianth of six pieces, enclosing six or fewer stamens in the case of the male flowers, and a three-celled, threewinged ovary in that of the female flowers. The ovary ripens into a membranous capsule, bursting by three valves to liberate numerous flattish or globose seeds. The species are natives of the warmer regions of both hemispheres, and many of them are important on account of the large amount of starch contained in their tubers. According to Prof. Church’s analysis of the Chinese yam, it contains more nutritive or nitrogenous matter, but less starch, than potatoes: in 100 parts there are of water 82∙6, starch 13∙1, albumen 2∙4, fat 0∙2, woody fibre 0∙4, and mineral matter 1∙3 parts.

D. sαtivα and D. alata are the species most widely diffused in tropical and sub-tropical countries. D. aculeata, grown in India, Cochin China, and the South Sea Islands, is esteemed one of the best varieties. D. japonica, the Chinese yam, is hardy in Great Britain, but the great depth to which its enormous tubers descend renders its cultivation unprofitable; the tubers of D. alata sometimes attain a weight of 100 lb. Most of the yams contain an acrid principle, which is dissipated in cooking.

The only European Dioscorea is that known as D. pyrenaica, found in 1845 in the Pyrenees, a remarkable instance of a species growing at along distance from all its congeners. True yams must not be confounded with the sweet potato, Convolvulus Batatas (see vol. xix. p. 597), as they sometimes are in London markets. The common black briony (Tamus communis) of hedges in England is closely allied to the yams of the tropics, and has a similar rootstock, which is reputed to be poisonous.
