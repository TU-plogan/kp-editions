YONKERS, a city of Westchester county, New York, United States, is situated upon the east bank of the Hudson river, about 18 miles from its mouth, and on the New York Central and Hudson River and the New York City and Northern Railroads. The site is very hilly, consisting of ridges forming terraces parallel to the river. The city had in 1880 a population of 18,892 (12,733 in 1870). Yonkers has important manufacturing industries, principally of carpets, hats, silk, brass goods, elevators (lifts), steam engines, and machinery; but it is chiefly as a residence suburb, being within an hour of the business centre of the metropolis, that it has acquired its population and importance.

Yonkers was settled by the Dutch of New Amsterdam about the middle of the 17th century, and was held as a manor until 1779. In 1788 it was organized as a township, and in 1872 it received a city charter.
