YORK, a borough and the county seat of York county, Pennsylvania, United States, is situated upon Codorus Creek, a branch of the Susquehanna river, and upon three railway lines,â€”the Pennsylvania, the Northern Central, and the Peachbottom. The surrounding country is undulating and is devoted to agriculture. The city is regularly laid out, with streets running diagonally to the cardinal points. It contains some manufactories of agricultural implements, paper-mills, car-shops, &c. The population in 1880 was 13,940; in 1870 it was 11,003.

The settlement of York dates from 1741. For nearly a year (1777-78) it was the place of meeting of the Continental Congress. In 1787 York was incorporated as a borough.
