YEOVIL, a market town and municipal borough of Somerset, England, is situated on the river Yeo or Ivel, which here separates Somerset from Dorset, and on branch lines of the London and South Western and the Great Western Railways, 40 miles south of Bristol and 124 westsouth-west of London. The streets are regular and spacious, with a number of handsome public buildings. A few of the houses are of considerable antiquity, but within recent years the town has undergone much alteration. The church of St John the Baptist, occupying a commanding site in the centre of the town, is a large and beautiful cruciform structure in the Perpendicular style, consisting of chancel, nave of seven bays, aisles, transepts, and lofty western tower. It is described by Mr Freeman as “a grand and harmonious whole, as truly the work of real artistic genius as Cologne or Winchester.” There are two ecclesiastical parishes within the borough, Hendford and Yeovil Marsh. The principal secular public buildings are the town-hall in the Grecian style, erected in 1849, and the corn exchange. There are a reading room and a library in connexion with the young men’s Christian association and mutual improvement society. The benevolent institutions include Woborne’s almshouses for six men and six women, the portreeves’ almshouses, and a few smaller charities. Water is obtained from Holywell, 8 miles distant, by works constructed by the corporation. Formerly the woollen manufacture was of some consequence, but this industry has now died out. The staple industry is the manufacture of gloves, for which the town has long been celebrated. Brewing and brick-making are also carried on. The agricultural trade of Yeovil is of some importance, large corn markets and cattle and horse fairs being held. The corporation consists of a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors, who hold the manorial rights and also form the urban sanitary authority. The town has a commission of the peace, and petty sessions are held both by the county and the borough magistrates. The population of the municipal borough and urban sanitary district (area about 700 acres) in 1871 was 8527, and in 1881 it was 8479.

Yeovil was a borough by prescription. Anciently it was called the town, borough, lordship, and hundred of Yeovil, and was included in a district which soon after the Conquest was taken possession of by the crown. The manor of Yeovil included in this district was some time afterwards assigned to the rector of St John the Baptist church, and was incorporated under the name of the portreeve and burgesses of Yeovil. In 1418 it was resigned by the rector to Henry V., who gave the manor to the convent of the Virgin Mary and Saint Bridget. The grant was confirmed by Edward IV. After the dissolution of the monasteries the manor was settled by Henry VIII. on Catherine Parr, who held it till her death. In 1449 the town was visited by a fire, by which 117 houses were destroyed. In 1853 Yeovil was placed under the Municipal Act.
