YOKOSUKA, a seaport and naval station of Japan, is situated in the province of Sagami and on the Bay of Tokio, 12 miles south of Yokohama (see map in vol. xxiii. p. 433). The port is sheltered by hills and affords good anchorage. The site was occupied by a small fishing village until 1865, when the shogun’s Government established a shipyard there. Since then it has grown rapidly and come into prominence. In 1868 the Japanese Government converted the shipyard into a naval dockyard, and subsequently carried out many improvements. In 1884 the port became a first-class naval station; and naval barracks, warehouses, offices, hospitals, &c., were established there. A large number of ships-of-war and of the mercantile marine are always found in the port, as well as an increasing number of foreign vessels, which come to be docked and repaired. The dockyard was first constructed by French engineers; but since 1875 the work has been entirely in the hands of Japanese engineers. The number of hands employed is about 2800. There are three dry docks and slips. The area occupied by the dockyard and other naval establishments is 7000 acres, and that of the town 270 acres. The population was 5800 in 1888.
