YEADON, a manufacturing town in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on a hill north of Airedale, about 1½ miles from Guiseley station on the Midland Railway and 8½ miles north-west of Leeds. The streets are generally irregular and tortuous, but within recent years greater care has been taken in the arrangement of new buildings. The church of St John in the Pointed Gothic style, erected in 1843, consists of chancel and nave, with square tower surmounted by pinnacles. The town-hall and mechanics’ institute, a handsome Gothic building erected in 1883, includes a large public hall, the rooms of the Liberal club and of the local board, and class and lecture rooms. Yeadon is chiefly of modern growth, although wool-combing and cloth manufacture were carried on to some extent before the establishment of the first woollen-mill in 1831. Since 1850 the town has made rapid progress, and now possesses several mills, in which woollen cloths are manufactured, especially materials for ladies’ jackets, ulsters, mantles, &c. The township was formed out of Guiseley in 1845. The local board of health was established in 1863. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1723 acres) was 5246 in 1871 and 6534 in 1881.
