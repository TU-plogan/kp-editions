YARRELL, William (1784-1856), one of the most popular of British naturalists, was born at Westminster in June 1784. His father was a newspaper agent, and he himself succeeded to the business on his fatherâ€™s death, and prosecuted it till within a few years of his own. He availed himself of any interval of relaxation to enjoy such sport as the neighbourhood of London afforded, acquired the reputation of being the best shot and the first angler in the metropolis, and soon also became an expert naturalist. In 1824 he became a fellow of the Linnean Society, and was a diligent contributor to their Transactions ; and he was one of the earliest members of the Zoological Society. The greater part of his leisure towards the end of his life was devoted to his two great works, The History of British Fishes (2 vols., 1836) and The History of British Birds (2 vols., 1843). These works are compiled on the same plan; they contain accurate figures, with accompanying descriptions, of every British fish or bird; and they have from the first taken their position as standard authorities. Few books on natural history are more agreeable to the general reader: the style is pleasant, and the truth with which he describes the habits of the birds is such as might have been expected from a keen and observant sportsman. In 1856 he had an attack of paralysis, of which he died at Yarmouth on 1st September of the same year.
