YVETOT, a town of France, chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Seine-Inférieure, stands on the plateau of Caux, 24 miles north-west of Rouen on the railway to Havre, and is chiefly known from Béranger’s famous song. Calicoes, tickings, Siamese, rouennerie cotton, reps, and handkerchiefs are made here, as in most places in the department, and a trade is carried on in wool. The church is ugly, but contains a marble altar from the Carthusian monastery at Rouen, some fine woodwork from the abbey of St Wandrille, and an elegant pulpit. The remains of a Bernardine monastery are occupied in part by the court and jail. The hospital and seminary are both modern. The population was 7625 (commune 8397) in 1881 and 7333 (commune 7972) in 1886.

From the 15th till the middle of the 16th century the lords of Yvetot bore the title of king, and their lands were exempt from all service to the French crown. The town was occupied during the Hundred Years’ War by Henry V. of England, and afterwards retaken by Charles VII. of France. On 8th May 1592 Henry IV. defeated here the troops of the League under the duke of Parma. A Bernardine monastery was founded at Yvetot in 1650, and suppressed in 1781. In 1658 part of the town was destroyed by fire.
