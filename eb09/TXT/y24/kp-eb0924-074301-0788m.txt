YEOLA, a municipal town of India, in the Násik district, Bombay presidency, with a population (1881) of 17,685 (males 8975, females 8710). It is situated in 20° 4' 10” N. lat. and 74° 30' 30" E. long., 44 miles east of Násik town, 13 miles south of Manwar station on the north-east line of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, and nearly 12 miles from the frontier of the Nizam’s dominions. Yeola is a flourishing commercial town, trading in silk and cotton goods, which it weaves, and in gold-twist, which it also manufactures.

At the time of its foundation Yeola was under the emperor of

Delhi; it subsequently passed into the hands of the rajas of Satara and then the peshwas. Finally it was given in grant to Vithal, the ancestor of the present chief of Vinchur, who still enjoys the revenue from the lands attached to the town, though he has no authority within it.
