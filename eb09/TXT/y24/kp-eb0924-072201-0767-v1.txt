Y

The history of this symbol has already been given under U. The three symbols U, V, Y are only differentiations of one original form.

The sound of y in Greek was that of French u in “lune” and German ü in “übel.” In Boeotian and Laconian Greek the old u -sound was retained; but it was represented by oυ, a digraph which had also the value of u in other dialects where it arose from phonetic change, e.g., in τoὑs (for τόvs ). The name ὔ ψιλόν was probably given to distinguish it from ὔ διά διφθόγγου,— that is, the same sound, but denoted by oι, which in the 2d century b.c. was beginning to have the value of υ ; just so ἕ ψιλόν is opposed to αι, or ἕ διà διφθόγγου. The difference in sound between the full and the modified u is this: for the first the lips are rounded as much as possible, and the back part of the tongue is raised towards the palate; for the second the rounding of the lips is the same, but the tongue is in the position for i, so that in sounding ü we are sounding i with the lips rounded in addition. This explains the ease with which the ι-sound is produced instead of ü by persons unfamiliar with the latter sound: when an Englishman pronouncing “Müller” says “Miller,” he puts the tongue right for i but omits to round the lips as well. This change has been a regular one in our language. There is no doubt that y (i.e., ü) was a sound of Early English (or Anglo-Saxon), as of the other Teutonic languages, in words like “fÿr” (fire), “synn” (sin); it was the “umlaut” of u , especially when followed in the next syllable by i or e ; so “burg” has for gen. and dat. “byrig,” orig. “burges,” “burge.” But in Middle English y passed into i : thus “fÿr” (sounded as für) came to be sounded as “fir” (feer), and this (as in other cases where ī occurs) was diphthongized in comparatively modern times into “fire” (faior). Thus in the middle of a word y lost its special value; on the other hand, at the beginning of a word it easily passed into the consonant y, the value which it has regularly in modern English. This explains the fact that the English language had no symbol for the sound of French « when this sound was re-introduced into England after the Norman Conquest. Accordingly the French symbol as well as the sound was taken: it is found in words like “muse,” “lute,” sounded as “myyz,” “lyyte.” The yy gradually developed into the iu sound with which we are familiar in “miūz,” “liūt”; but the spelling remained unchanged. It must have been awkward to have the symbol « representing both the full (native) sound and the modified (French) sound; this was partially obviated by borrowing for the full «-sound the French writing ou: e.g., “hūs” was written “house,” without at first any change of sound; but this was not consistently carried out. Much later, at the end of the 16th century, the sound was diphthongized into “haus” (as now), but the spelling (o«) remained. The fact that y and i became indistinguishable led to the use of y at the end of a word instead of i : thus we write “day” instead of the older “dai.”

In Early English we find the symbol 3 (which is a modification of the Anglo-Saxon f) used initially with the value of g , and medially (chiefly before t ) where modern English writes gh, as in light. This is due to French scribes, who used the French (i.e., our modern) form of g for the g -sound, and then the 3 for the sound which had been weakened in Anglo-Saxon from g to y, as in yard (our yard) for original gard (Norse garth ; in North English Aysgarth and Gatesgarth). About the 15th century this same symbol was mistaken for 2, and as such it is still occasionally employed in cursive, when 3 is written instead of 2.
