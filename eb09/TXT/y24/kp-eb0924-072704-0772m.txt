YANAON, a French settlement in India, near the mouth of the Godavari on the Orissa coast, in the Godavari district, Madras presidency. It is situated in 16° 44' 10" N. lat. and 82° 12' 5" E. long., and has an area of 2258 acres and a population of 4473.

Yanaon was founded shortly before 1750, and its fortunes followed the vicissitudes of French history in southern India. With the other French possessions in India it was secured by the treaty of 1814-15.
