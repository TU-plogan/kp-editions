LINNELL, John (1792-1882), a richly gifted English painter, was born in London on the 16th of June 1792. His father being a carver and gilder, Linnell was early brought into contact with artists, and when he was ten years old he was already drawing and selling his portraits in chalk and pencil. His first artistic instruction was received from Benjamin West, and he spent a year in the house of John Varley the water-colour painter, where he had William Hunt and Mulready as fellow pupils, and made the acquaintance of Shelley, Godwin, and other men of mark and individuality. In 1805 he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy, where he obtained medals for drawing, modelling, and sculpture. He was also trained as an engraver, and executed a transcript of the Burial of Saul, one of Varley’s most impressive pictures. In after life he frequently occupied himself with the burin, publishing, in 1834, a series of outlines from Michelangelo’s frescos in the Sistine chapel, and, in 1840, superintending the issue of a selection of plates from the pictures in Buckingham Palace, one of them, a Titian landscape, being mezzotinted by himself. At first he supported himself mainly by miniature painting, and by the execution of [9:14:675] larger portraits, such as the likenesses of Mulready, Whately, Peel, and Carlyle. Several of his portraits he engraved with his own hand in line and mezzotint He also painted many subjects like the St John Preaching, the Covenant of Abraham, and the Journey to Emmaus, in which, while the landscape background is usually prominently insisted upon, the figures are yet of sufficient size and importance to supply the title of the work. But it is mainly in connexion with his long series of paintings of pure landscape that his name is known to the public. When he was only seventeen, his Removing Timber carried off the fifty-guinea prize offered by the British Institution for the best landscape, and for many years Linnell was a regular contributor to the exhibitions of that body, and to those of the Royal Academy and the Society of Painters in Oil and Water Colours. His works commonly deal with some scene of typical uneventful English landscape, which is made impressive by a gorgeous effect of sunrise or sunset. They are full of true poetic feeling, and are rich and glowing in colour. His art proved exceptionally remunerative; he was able to command very large prices for his pictures, and about 1850 he purchased a property at Redhill, Surrey, where he resided till his death, on the 20th of January 1882, surrounded by his children—two of them artists like himself—and his children’s children, and painting with unabated power till within the last few years of his life. His leisure was greatly occupied with a study of the Scriptures in the original, and he published several pamphlets and larger treatises of Biblical criticism. Among his literary productions are a work on The Misnaming of the Scripture the Old and New Testament, 1856 ; The Lord’s Day the Day of the Lord, 1859; a pamphlet on The Ascension Sacrifice of the Old Testament, 1864; and one on The Royal Academy a National Institution, 1869. A word should be said regarding Linnell·s connexion with William Blake. He was one of the best friends and kindest patrons of the great visionary artist. He gave him the two largest commissions he ever received for single series of designs— .£150 for drawings and engravings of The Inventions to the Book of Job, and a like sum for those illustrative of Dante.
