LACONIA, the Greek Λακωνική, is the name generally applied in modern times to the country which occupied the south-eastern corner of the Peloponnesus, often called Lacedaemon, Λακeδαi∕xωv, which is the only name used in Homer. The history of the district has already been given (see Greece), and it only remains to give a slight sketch of its physical features. These are very peculiar, and had great influence in producing the marked and distinctive character of the section of the Dorian race which occupied Laconia throughout the historical period. The country is a deep valley almost completely surrounded by mountains, and it is the general opinion that both names, Laconia and Lacedaemon,, refer to this hollow sunken character, being connected with lacus, λάκκος, Ac. The mountains of Arcadia shut in this valley on the north, and from them two parallel chains of mountains stretch due south bounding the valley on the east and on the west. The eastern chain bore in ancient times the name Taygetus, the western, Parnon; both ridges stretched far out into the sea, forming respectively the promontories of Taenarus and Malea. Taygetus, now called Pentedaktylon, is a splendid unbroken chain of lofty peaks, well deserving its Homeric epithet πeρψ.τ ∣ κfτo'i; the highest point is the ancient Taleton, now St Elias, 7900 feet high. Mount Parnon is not such a fine ridge, but still forms a strong barrier along the sea-coast. Through the whole length of the valley from north to south flows the river Eurotas, which has only one tributary of any consequence, the Oenus. The soil was not remarkably fertile, except in the low ground towards the sea; but the sides of Taygetus were covered with dense forests which afforded excellent sport to the inhabitants of the plain. The people were thus inured to the hardy life of mountaineers; they were so securely defended by nature against invasion that the victorious Epaminondas hesitated to attack the country; while with command of the passes they could at any time invade the neighbouring countries. Over Mount Taygetus there was hardly any pass practicable for an army; from Arcadia there were only two entrances, both easily defended, one by the course of the Oenus, the other by the Eurotas. Mount Parnon stretched along the east coast, which offered no harbour, hardly even a landing place, for foreign ships. While adding to the security of the country, the same causes isolated it greatly from intercourse with other peoples, tended to keep the inhabitants backward and to prevent education, and led to that jealous and exclusive character which distinguished the Lacedaemonians.
