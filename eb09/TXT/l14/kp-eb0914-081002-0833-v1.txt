LOḲMÁN, a name famous in Arabian tradition. The Arabs distinguish two persons of this name. The older Lokmân was an 'Ädite, and is said to have built the famous dyke of Ma’rib. He not only escaped the destruction sent on his nation for their refusal to hear the prophet Hùd, but received the gift of a life as long as that of seven vultures, each of which is said to have lived eighty years.^[1. Tabary, i. 240; Abulf., H. A. , 20; Darairy, ii. 384. The tradition has various forms. Masudy, iii. 366, 375, gives Lokmân only the age of one vulture. Further details are given by Caussin de Perceval, Essai. The vultures of Lokmân, especially the seventh, whose name was Lobad, are often referred to in Arabic poetry and proverbs.] The other Lokmân, called “Lokmân the Sage,” is mentioned in the Koran (xxxi. 11). He is said to have been a Nubian slave, son of 'Ankâ, and to have lived in the time of David in the region of Êlah and Midian (Masùdy, i. 110), but the commentators on the Koran (Abu Sa ’ ffd, ii. 336) make him son of Bâ'ùrâ, the son of Job’s sister or daughter. This form of the legend, and many of the stories told of him (D’Herbelot, s.v., but not those given by Nawawy, p. 526), show Jewish influence on the legend, and Derenbourg {Fables de Loqmân le sage, 1850) has pointed out that Bâ'ùrâ seems to be identical with Beor, and that Lokmân corresponds to Balaam, the roots of both names meaning “to swallow,” so that the one may be viewed as a translation of the other. In favour of this identification Derenbourg advances several important and probably conclusive arguments from Jewish tradition; but in view of the divergent accounts given of Lokmân it may be questioned whether Jewish influence created or only modified the Arabic tradition. The grave of Lokmân was shown on the east coast of the Lake of Tiberias, but also in Yemen and elsewhere (Yâkùt, iii. 512; D’Herbelot, s.υ.).

The name of Lokmân is associated with numerous old verses, proverbs, and anecdotes of which Freytag, Arabum Proverbia, gives many examples. The fables which pass under his name, and were first printed by Erpenius (Leyden, 1615), are not mentioned by any Arabic writer. They appear to be of Christian origin, and are mainly derived, though not closely copied, from those of Syntipas and Aesop. They existed in the 13th century (Derenbourg, ui supra'). The editions are numerous, the book having been much used as an elementary Arabic reading-book. Those of Rüdiger -(2d ed. 1839, with glossary) and Derenbourg (1850) claim special mention.
