LOACH. The loaches lCobitidina} are small fishes of the Carp family (Cyprinidse), with a generally cylindrical body, with very small or without any scales, with six or more barbels round the mouth, with a short dorsal and anal fin, and with the pharyngeal teeth in a single series. The air-bladder is double, as in other carps, the two divisions lying side by side, or one behind the other; but [9:14:742] it is always entirely or partially enclosed in a bony capsule formed by the anterior vertebrae. The largest of the ninety species known grow to a length of 10 or 12 inches, but the majority are of much smaller dimensions. They are found in Europe and Asia only. The typical species are partial to fast-running streams with stony bottoms; they abound in the waters draining the central Alps of Asia, and extend far towards the north of the Europo-Asiatic region. The tropical forms from south of the Himalayas are not less common, and some of them have assumed a more compressed form of the body with a bright coloration. In Great Britain two species occur, viz., the common loach (Nemachilus barbatulus'), and the more local C obitis taenia, which is distinguished by a small spine below the eye. The former is esteemed as food in parts of the Continent where it occurs in sufficient abundance. See Ichthyology.
