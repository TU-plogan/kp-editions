LAURENS, John (1756-1782), an American revolutionary officer of distinguished bravery, son of Henry Laurens noticed above, was born at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1756. He was educated in England, and on his return to America in 1777, in the height of the revolutionary struggle, he joined Washington’s staff. He soon gained his commander’s confidence, which he reciprocated with the most devoted attachment, and was entrusted with the delicate duties of a confidential secretary, which he performed with much tact and skill. He was present in all Washington's battles, from that of the Brandywine to Yorktown, and his gallantry on every occasion has gained him the title of “the Bayard of the Revolution.” Laurens displayed bravery even to rashness in the storming of the Chew mansion at Germantown; at Monmouth, where he saved Washington’s life by rushing between him and danger, and was himself severely wounded; and at Coosahatchie, where, with a handful of men, he defended a pass against a large English force under General Prevost, and where he was again wounded. In command of a body of light infantry at the storming of Savannah, he was among the first to penetrate the English lines, and again distinguished himself at the siege of Charleston in 1780. After the capture of Charleston by the English, he rejoined Washington, and was selected by him as a special envoy to appeal to the king of France for supplies for the relief of the American armies, which had been brought by prolonged service and scanty pay to the verge of dissolution. The more active co-operation of the French fleets with the land forces in Virginia, which was one result of his mission, brought about the unexpected overwhelming of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Laurens lost no time in rejoining the army, and at Yorktown was at the head of the American storming party which captured the first redoubt, and received the sword of Colonel Campbell, its commander. Laurens was designated with Count de Noailles to arrange the terms of a surrender, which occurred October 19,1781, and virtually ended the war, although desultory skirmishing, especially in the south, attended the months of delay before peace was formally concluded. In one of these trifling affairs in July 1782, on the Combahee Ferry, Laurens exposed himself needlessly and was killed. Washington lamented deeply the death of Laurens, then in his twenty-seventh year, saying of him, “He had not a fault that I could discover, unless it were intrepidity bordering upon rashness.”
