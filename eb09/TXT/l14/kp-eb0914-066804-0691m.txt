LINKÖPING, a city of Sweden, the see of a bishop, and the chief town of the province of East Gothland, is situated in a fertile plain 21 miles by rail south-west of Stockholm, and communicates with Lake Roxen (∣ mile to the north) and the Gata and Kinda canals by means of the now navigable Stângâ. Most of the houses are of wood. The cathedral (1150-1499), a Romanesque building with a Gothic choir, is, next to the cathedral of Upsala, the largest church in Sweden, and, since the cathedral of Trondhjem has lost so many of its treasures, presents the richest variety of objects of interest to the student of mediaeval art in the country. In the church of St Lawrence, also called the Church of the Estates, are some paintings [9:14:669] by Hörberg, the Swedish peasant artist. Other buildings of note are the massive old episcopal palace (1470-1500), afterwards a royal palace, and the old gymnasium founded by Gustavus Adolphus in 1627, which contains a valuable library (30,000 volumes) of old books and manuscripts, formerly kept in the cathedral The population, 3285 in 1810, was 8706 in 1878.

Linköping early became a place of mark, and was already a bishop’s see in 1082. It was at a council held in the town in 1153 that the payment of Peter’s pence was agreed to at the instigation of Nicholas Breakspeare, afterwards Adrian IV. The coronation of Birger Jarlsson Waldemar took place in the cathedral in 1251; and in the reign of Gustavus Vasa several important diets were held in the town. A large portion of it was burned down in 1700.
