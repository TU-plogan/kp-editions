LAW, William (1686-1761). The events of the life of this remarkable man may be very briefly stated. He was born in 1686 at King’s Cliffe; in 1705 he entered as a sizar at Emmanuel College, Cambridge; in 1711 he was elected fellow of his college and received holy orders, and in 1712 he took his M.A. degree. He resided at Cambridge, taking pupils and occasional duty until the accession of George I., when his conscience forbade him to take the oaths of allegiance to the new Government and of abjuration of the Stuarts; his staunch Jacobitism had already been betrayed in a tripos speech which brought him into trouble; and he was now deprived of his fellowship, and became a nonjuror. For the next few years he is said to have been a curate in London, but the point is doubtful. In 1727 we find him domiciled at Putney as tutor to Edward Gibbon, father of the historian, and “the much honoured friend and spiritual director of the whole family” (Gibbon, The Memoirs of my Life and Writings). In the same year he accompanied his pupil to Cambridge, and resided with him as governor, in term time, for the next four years. His pupil then went abroad, but Law was left at Putney, where he remained in Mr Gibbon’s house for more than ten years, acting as a religious guide not only to the family but to a number of pious men who used to make pilgrimages to consult the Putney sage. The most eminent of these were the two brothers John and Charles Wesley, Dr Byrom the poet, Dr Cheyne the famous physician, and Mr Archibald Hutcheson, M.P. for Hastings. In 1737 Mr Gibbon the elder died, and the household was, a short time afterwards, dispersed. Law therefore was parted from his friends, leaving behind him, the historian tells us, “in our family the reputation of a worthy and pious man, who believed all that he professed, and practised all that he enjoined.” In 1740 Law retired to his native village, where he had inherited from his father a house and a small property. There he was presently joined by two ladies, Mrs Hutcheson, the rich widow of his old friend, who recommended her on bis death-bed to place herself under Law’s spiritual guidance, and Miss Hester Gibbon, sister to his late pupil. This curious trio lived for twenty-one years a life wholly given to devotion and charity, until the death of Law in 1761.

Such was the singularly uneventful life of this good man; but during the whole period from the time when he became a non-juror almost to the day of his death he was busily engaged in literary work which places him in the very first rank of 18th century divines. As a writer, it will be convenient to consider him under three heads.

1. As a singularly able controversialist. The first of his controversial works was Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor (1717), which were considered both by friend and foe as one of the most powerful contributions to the Bangorian controversy on the High Church side. Dean (afterwards Bishop) Sherlock declared that “Mr Law was a writer so considerable that he knew but one good reason why his lordship did not answer him.” Law’s next controversial work was Remarks on Mandeville's Fable of the Bees (1723), in which he vindicates morality on the highest grounds; for pure style, caustic wit, and lucid argument this is a perfect gem; it was enthusiastically praised by John Sterling, and has been republished by F. D. Maurice. Law’s Case of Reason (1732), in answer to TindaΓs Christianity as old as the Creation is to a great extent an anticipation of Bishop Butler’s famous argument in the Analogy. In this work Law shows himself at least the equal of the ablest champion of Deism. His Letters to a Lady inclined to enter the Church of Rome are excellent specimens of the attitude which a High-Churchman maintains against Romanism.

2. As a very effective writer on practical divinity. The Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life (1729), together with its predecessor, A Treatise of Christian Perfection (1726), deeply influenced the chief actors in the great Evangelical revival. The Wesleys, Whitefield, Venn, Scott, and Adam all express their deep obligation to the author. The Serious Call affected other’s quite as deeply. Dr Johnson, Gibbon, Lord Lyttelton, and Bishop Horne all speak enthusiastically of its merits; and it has been, until lately, perhaps the only work by which its author was popularly known. In a tract entitled The Absolute Unlawfulness of Stage Entertainments, Law, unlike himself, was tempted by the undoubted corruptions of the stage of the period to use language which transcends the bounds of reason.

3. As one of the few English mystics. Though the least popular, by far the most interesting, original, and suggestive of all Law’s works are those which he wrote in his later years, after he had become an enthusiastic admirer (not a disciple) of Jacob Boehme, the Teutonic theosopher. From his earliest years he had been deeply impressed with the piety, beauty, and thoughtfulness of the writings of the Christian mystics, but it was not till after his accidental meeting with the works of Boehme, about 1734, that pronounced mysticism appears in his works. It would far transcend the limits of this article to describe, however briefly, the purport of Law’s mystic writings. All are very beautiful; some are wild and fanciful; but not one of them is inconsistent with his position as a churchman, and even a very high churchman of the spiritual type. The titles of the works written by Law in his mystic stage aie A [9:14:370] Demonstration of the Gross and Fundamental Errors of a late Book called a “Plain Account, Ac., of the Lord's Supper,” 1737; An Appeal to all that Doubt and Disbelieve the Truths of Revelation, 1739; The Grounds and Reason of Christian Regeneration, 1739; An Earnest and Serious Answer to Dr Trapp’s Sermon on being Righteous Overmuch, 1740; The Spirit of Prayer, 1749, 1752; The Way to Divine Knowledge, 1752; The Spirit of Love, 1752, 1754; A Short but Sufficient Confutation of Dr Warburton’s Projected Defence las he calls it) of Christianity in his Divine Legation of Moses, 1757; A Series of Letters, 1760; a Dialogue between a Methodist and a Churchman, 1760; and An Humble, Earnest, and Affectionate Address to the Clergy, 1761.

Mr R. Tighe wrote a short account of Law’s life at the beginning of this century. Mr C. Walton printed for private circulation Notes and Materials for a Complete Biography of W. Law, in 1848; Mr Leslie Stephen in his English Thought in the 18iΛ Century, Mr Lecky in his History of England in the 18tA Century, and Mr Abbey in The English Church in the ⅛th Century, all give sketches of Law's life, character, and works; and Mr Overton has devoted a volume to him, entitled William Law, Non-juror and Mystic, 1881.
