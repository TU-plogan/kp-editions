LANDER, Richard (1804-1834) and John (1807- 1839), two brothers, African explorers, were natives of Cornwall. Richard Lander accompanied the Niger expedition of 1825-27 as Clapperton’s attendant, and on the death of his master at Sokoto on the Niger in April 1827, [9:14:272] returned to England, and published an account of the expedition in 1830. He exhibited such capacity for the work of African exploration that the British Government decided to send him out to determine the course of the lower Niger, which was then unknown. In the expedition he was accompanied by his brother John, who was better educated then Richard, and who went as an unsalaried volunteer. Leaving England in January 1830, the brothers landed at Badagry on the Guinea coast on March 22. They then travelled north-east to Boosa on the Niger, and after a trip north as far as Yaoorie they proceeded down the river in canoes. At Kirree they were taken prisoners by the natives, and after some delay were conveyed down the river and managed to escape in a brig, the river journey lasting about five months. The Landers were thus able to lay down with approximate correctness the lower course of the Niger, and to prove that it discharged by a delta into the Gulf of Guinea. They lost many of their records at Kirree, but published a detailed narrative of their exploration in three volumes, in 1832 (Journal of an Expedition io explore the Course and Termination of the Niger, by John and Richard Lander). In 1832 Richard went out again at the head of a well-equipped expedition, organized by Liverpool merchants for the purpose of opening up trade in the Niger, and founding a commercial settlement at the junction of the Binué with the main river. After making several successful journeys, he was again on his way up the river in January 1834, when on the 20th the party were attacked by natives, and Lander was wounded. He died of his wounds at Fernando Po on February 6. John Lander died November 16, 1839.
