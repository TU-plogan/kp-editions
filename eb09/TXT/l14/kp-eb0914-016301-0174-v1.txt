L

L represents probably the same sound in all alphabets.

That sound used to be called a “liquid,” in which class m, n, and r were included. This arrangement was unsatisfactory so far as m and n are concerned, for they have nothing common in their formation with the others. But r and l are very closely akin. They are both dentals —or more accurately front palatals—produced by raising the point of the tongue to the front part of the palate, immediately behind the gums. They differ in this: for r a small aperture is left over the tip of the tongue by which the air escapes; but for l the tongue reaches the top of the palate, but does not rest (as for r) against the sides of the mouth, and the voice escapes laterally by these side-apertures. The slightness of the difference in the positions of the mouth for these two sounds explains their exchangeableness. Perhaps the most remarkable variation of the l sound is that which is heard in Welsh and denoted by ll, in such words as Llanberis, Llangollen, &c. An Englishman commonly sounds this as thl, which is certainly not right. But the best authorities on phonetics are not agreed as to the precise nature of the sound. Mr Ellis thinks that it is produced by laying the left side of the tongue against the whole of the palate, and then forcibly ejecting the breath along the right side. But he admits that the sound thus produced differs very little from a voiceless or surd l (the common l is sonant), which stands therefore to l in the same relation as f does to v, or wh (really hui) to w. A simpler modification of the l sound is that heard in the Italian “gli” or in the Spanish “llano”; it is formed by raising the middle part of the tongue to the roof of the mouth, not the point against the front part of the palate, as for the ordinary I.

The peculiar nature of the l sound renders it apt to fall out before consonants with which it is inconsistent; this is specially seen in French plurals, such as “chevaux” from “cheval.” It is also common, but sporadic, in English; e,g., in “walk,” “talk,” “palm,” “alms,” “half,” “would,” &c. As is frequently the case with such vanishing sounds, it has sometimes intruded through false analogy in words with which it has nothing to do, e.g., in “could” (Old English “coude ”), and rather strangely in some words of Latin origin, e.g., participle, principle. The form of the letter L has varied slightly, but has always consisted of two straight lines at an angle. In Greek the form was generally A; and this has been preserved in the Cyrillic and Russian alphabets. But in the western Greek alphabet the form was generally L ; and this appears in old Roman inscriptions, passing by degrees into the right angle with which we are familiar.
