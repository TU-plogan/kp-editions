LISMORE, a market-town and seat of a diocese, partly in Cork but chiefly in Waterford, Ireland, is beautifully situated on a steep eminence rising abruptly from the Blackwater, 40 miles west-south-west of Waterford. At the verge of the rock on the western side is the old baronial castle, erected by King John in 1185, which was the residence of the bishops till the 16 th century. It was besieged in 1641 and 1643, and in 1645 it was partly destroyed by fire. To the east, on the summit of the height, is the cathedral of St Carthagh, erected in 1663 by the earl of Cork, in the Later English style, with a square tower surmounted by a tapering spire. There are a grammar school, a free school, and a number of charities. Some trade is carried on by means of the river, and there is a salmon fishery. The population of the town in 1871 was 1946.

The original name of Lismore was Maghsoiath. Its present name was derived from a monastery, founded by St Carthagh in 633, which became so celebrated as a seat of learning that it is said no less than twenty churches were erected in its vicinity. In the 9th and beginning of the 10th centuries the town was repeatedly plundered by the Danes, and in 978 the town and abbey were burned by the Ossorians. Henry II., after landing at Waterford, received in Lismore castle the allegiance of the archbishops and bishops of Ireland. In 1518 the manor was granted to Sir Walter Raleigh, from whom it passed to Sir Richard Boyle, afterwards earl of Cork. From the earls of Cork it descended by marriage to the dukes of Devonshire. It was incorporated as a municipal borough in the time of Charles I., when it also received the privilege of returning members to parliament, but at the Union it was disfranchised, and also ceased to exercise its municipal functions. Lismore is the birthplace of Robert Boyle, but its claim to be the birthplace of Congreve does not rest on a sufficient foundation.
