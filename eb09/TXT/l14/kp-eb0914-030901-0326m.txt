LÁR, a city of Persia, capital of Lâristân, in 27° 30' N. lat., 53° 58' E. long., 174 miles from Shirâz, and 127 from the coast at Mogu Bay. Lâr stands at the foot of a mountain range in an extensive plain covered with palm trees. The crest of a hill immediately behind the town is crowned by the ruins of a castle formerly deemed impregnable. Lâr was once a flourishing place, but a large portion is now in ruins, and the population is reduced to about 12,000. There are still some good buildings, of which the most prominent is the bazaar, said to be the finest in Persia, and resembling that of Shirâz, but considerably larger. The governor’s residence stands in the centre of the town, and is surrounded by strong walls flanked with towers. There is also an outer moat filled by a canal of recent structure, which also serves to supply the numerous cisterns when the rain water fails. Lâr is noted for its manufacture of muskets and cloth.
