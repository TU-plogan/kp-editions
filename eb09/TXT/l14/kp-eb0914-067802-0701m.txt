LINUS, one of the saints of the Gregorian canon, was, according to the Breviarium Romanum, the immediate successor of Peter in the see of Rome. He was a native of Volterra, who had attained a high degree of sanctity, and by his prevailing faith was able, not only to cast out devils, but to raise the dead. He wrote an account of the res gestae of Peter, especially of his controversy with Simon Magus. He was beheaded by the orders of the ungrateful consul Saturninus, whose daughter he had freed from demoniac possession, after a pontificate of eleven years two months and twenty-three days. The authorities for the statement that Linus was, leaving Peter out of account, the earliest president of the Roman Church, are very early (Irenaeus, Adv. Haer., iii. 3, 3; Euseb., H. E., iii. 2, 13); and that there actually was a presbyter of that name may be gathered from 2 Tim. iv. 21. According to Tertullian, however (Z>e Presser., 32), Peter appointed Clement to be his successor. The genuineness of the alleged epitaph of Linus found in Rome is now no longer maintained; and the two books on the martyrdom of Peter and Paul, which pass under his name, must also be regarded as apocryphal and late.
