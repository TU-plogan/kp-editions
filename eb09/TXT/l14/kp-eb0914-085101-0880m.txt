LONDON, a city and port of entry in the Dominion of Canada, the chief town of the county of Middlesex, Ontario, and the see both of a Roman Catholic bishop and of the Anglican bishop of Huron, lies 25 miles north of Lake Erie and 32 miles south-east of Lake Huron, in the midst of a fine agricultural country in the angle made by the confluence of the two branches of the Thames. It is a station on the main line of the Great Western Railway, and the terminus of a branch of the Grand Trunk Railway from St Mary’s, a line from Port Stanley on Lake Erie, and the London, Huron, and Bruce Railway. The local nomenclature of London is in great measure a reproduction of that of the great city whose name it has ambitiously borrowed: the Thames is again spanned by a Westminster and a Blackfriars Bridge, and it has a Hyde Park, a Covent Garden Market, a Crystal Palace, a Tower of London (its jail and court-house), a St Paul’s Cathedral, with Pall Mall, Piccadilly, Cheapside, <fcc. Among the more important buildings are the city-hall, the court-houses, the city hospital, the lunatic asylum, the orphan asylum, the Roman Catholic convent. The educational institutions include the Collegiate Institute, Hellmuth Ladies’ College, the Academy of the Sacred Heart, and the newly-founded Western University. The chief industry is oil-refining— the crude oil being brought from Enniskillen wells, a distance of 40 miles. There are also railway-car works, boiler and stove and other iron works, and chemical works; and furniture, farming implements, carriages, and waggons are manufactured on an extensive scale. The value of the imports has increased from £176,400 in 1861 to £522,391 [9:14:852] in 1881; and the value of the exports from <£76,000 to <£131,141. Three daily and five weekly newspapers and three monthly periodicals issue from the local press. The city is divided into seven wards, and is governed by a mayor and aidermen. First laid out in 1825-6, it returned a member in 1836, and was incorporated in 1840. The population was 15,826 in 1871, and 19,746 in 1881; but the East, West, and South London suburbs—really part of the city, though not yet included within the municipal boundaries—have a population of upwards of 10,000.
