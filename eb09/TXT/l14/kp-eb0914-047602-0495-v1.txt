LESLIE, or Lesley, Charles (1650-1722), a prominent nonjuror, famous as the author of A Short and Easy Method with the Deists, was born in 1650 in Ireland, where his father, Dr John Leslie, was bishop of Raphoe and subsequently of Clogher. His early education was received at Inniskilling, Fermanagh, and in 1664 he was admitted a fellow commoner in Trinity College, Dublin, where he continued until he commenced master of arts. On his father’s death in 1671, removing to England, he entered himself as a student of law at the Temple, but soon afterwards turned his attention to theology, and took orders in 1680. Seven years later he became chancellor of the cathedral of Connor and a justice of the peace, and began a long career of public controversy by responding in public disputation at Monaghan to the challenge of the Roman Catholic bishop of Clogher. Although an eager and uncompromising opponent of Roman Catholicism, Leslie was a firm supporter of the Stuart dynasty, and, having declined at the Revolution to take the oath to William and Mary, he was on this account deprived of his benefice. In 1689 the growing troubles in Ireland induced him to withdraw to England, where he employed himself for the next twenty years in writing various controversial pamphlets in favour of the nonjuring cause, and in numerous polemics against the Quakers, Jews, Socinians, and Papists, and especially in that against the Deists with which his name is now most commonly associated. A warrant having been issued against him in 1710 for his pamphlet The Good Old Cause, or Lying in Truth, he in that year resolved to quit England and to accept an offer made by the Pretender (with whom he had previously been in frequent correspondence) that he should reside with him at Bar-le-duc. After the failure of the Stuart cause in 1715, Leslie accompanied his patron into Italy, where he remained until 1721, in which year, having found his sojourn amongst Roman Catholics extremely unpleasant, he sought and obtained permission to return to his native country. He died at Glaslough, Monaghan, on April 13, 1722.

The Theological JVorks of Leslie were collected and published by himself in 2 vols, folio in 1721; a later edition, slightly enlarged, appeared at Oxford in 1832 (7 vols. 8vo). They handle the controverted points of which they treat with considerable force of argument and vigour of style; he had the somewhat rare distinction of making several converts by his reasonings, and probably persons might still be found who are prepared to concur in Dr Johnson’s dictum that “Leslie was a reasoner, and a reasoner who was not to be reasoned against.” But the questions in dispute are no longer discussed on the basis which seems to have been pretty unanimously accepted by the orthodox theologians of that age. This is sufficiently seen when the promise given in the title of his best-known work is contrasted with the actual performance. The book professes to be A Short and Easy Method with the Deists, wherein the certainty of the Christian Religion is Demonstrated by Infallible Proof from Four Rules, which are incompatible to any imposture that over yet has been, or that can possibly be (1697). The four rules which, according to Leslie, have only to be rigorously applied in order to establish not the probability merely but the absolute certainty of the truth of Christianity are simply these:—(1) that the matter of fact be such as that men’s outward senses, their eyes and ears, may be judges of it; (2) that it be done publicly, in the face of the world; (3) that not only public monuments be kept up in memory of it, but some outward actions be performed; (4) that such monuments and such actions or observances be instituted and do commence from the time that the matter of fact was done. Other publications of Leslie are The Snake in the Grass (1696), against the Quakers; A Short Method with the Jews(1689); The Socinian Controversy Discussed (1697); The True Notion of the Catholic Church (1703); and The Case Stated between the Church of Rome and the Church of England (1713).
