LAZARUS, St, Order of. This religious and military order dates its origin from the occupation of Jerusalem by the first crusaders, its primary object being the succour of the leprous, of whom Lazarus (Luke xvi. 20 sq.) was regarded as the patron. After the expulsion of the crusaders the hospitallers of St Lazarus established themselves in France, where Louis VII. (1253) gave them the lands of Boigny near Orleans, and a building at the gates of Paris which they turned into a lazar house for the use of the lepers of the city. * A papal confirmation was obtained from Alexander IV. in 1255. The gradual disappearance of leprosy combined with other causes to change the order into a purely civil corporation. In 1572 it was in Savoy merged by Gregory XIII. in the order of St Maurice. In 1608 it was in France united with that of Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel; abolished at the Revolution, it was reintroduced at the Restoration, but is again in abeyance, the only order at present conferred or recognized being that of the Legion of Honour. In 1633 the buildings of the priory in Paris were handed over to St Vincent de Paul for the use of the fathers of his mission, who from this circumstance came to be generally known as Lazarites.
