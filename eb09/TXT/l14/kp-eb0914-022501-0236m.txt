LALANDE, JosephJérôme Lefrançais de (1732- 1807), a noted astronomer, was born at Bourg (department of Ain), July 11, 1732. His parents, who were in easy circumstances, sent him to Paris to study the law; but the accident of lodging in the Hôtel Cluny, where Delisle had his observatory, determined his astronomical vocation, and he became the zealous and favoured pupil of both Delisle and Lemonnier. He, however, completed his legal studies, and was on the point of returning to Bourg to practise there as an advocate, when Lemonnier obtained permission to send him, in his own place, to Berlin, for the purpose of making observations on the lunar parallax in concert with those of Lacaille at the Cape of Good Hope. The successful execution of his task procured for him, before he was twenty-one, admission to the Academy of Berlin, and the post of adjunct astronomer to that of Paris. He now devoted himself to the improvement of the planetary theory, publishing in 1759 a corrected edition of Halley’s tables, with ahistory of the celebrated comet whose return in that year he had aided Clairaut to calculate. In 1762, Delisle resigned in his favour the chair of astronomy in the Collège de France, the duties of which were discharged by Lalande with éclat during forty-six years. His house became an astronomical seminary, and amongst his pupils were Delambre, Piazzi, Mechain, and his own nephew, Michel Lalande. By his publications in connexion with the transit of 1769 he won great and, in some respects, deserved fame. But his love of notoriety fully equalled his scientific zeal, and earned for him as much ridicule as his impetuous temper did hostility. These faults were partially outweighed by his generosity and benevolence. A strict adherence to hygienic rules long preserved his health, but eventually shortened his life. He died April 4, 1807, of consumption aggravated by systematic exposure to cold.

Although his investigations were conducted with diligence rather than genius, the career of Lalande must be regarded as of eminent service to astronomy. By his talents as a lecturer and writer he gave to the science unexampled popularity; his planetary tables, into which he introduced corrections for mutual perturbations, were the best available up to the end of the last century; and. the Lalande prize, instituted by him in 1802 for the chief astronomical performance of each year, still testifies to his enthusiasm for his favourite pursuit. Amongst his voluminous works are Traité d' Astronomie, 2 vols. 4to, 1764 (enlarged edition, 4 vols., 1771-81, 3d edition, 3 vols., 1792); Histoire céleste Française, 1801, giving the places of 50,000 stars; Bibliographie astronomique, 1803, with a history of astronomy from 1781 to 1802; Astronomie des Dames, 1785; Abrégé de Navigation, 1793; Voyage d'τιn François en Italie, 1769, a valuable record of his travels in 1765-66. He communicated above one hundred and fifty papers to the Paris Academy of Sciences, edited the Connaissance des Temps, 1759-1774, and again 1794- 1807, and wrote the concluding 2 vols, of the 2d edition of Montucla’s Histoire des Mathématiques, 1802.
