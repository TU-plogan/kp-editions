LEOBSCHÜTZ (Bohemian, Hlubczyce), a town in the Prussian province of Silesia, circle of Oppeln, is situated on the Zinna, about 20 miles to the north-west of Ratibor. It carries on a considerable trade in wool, flax, and grain, its markets for these commodities being very numerously attended. The principal industries are carriage-building, wool-spinning, and glass-making. The town contains three Roman Catholic churches, a Protestant church, a synagogue, a new town-hall, and a gymnasium. Leobschütz is known to have existed in the 10th century, and from 1524 to 1623 was capital of the principality of Jägerndorf, which was divided between Prussia and Austria in 1742. Population in 1880, 12,015.
