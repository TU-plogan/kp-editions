LASCARIS, Joannes or Janus (c. 1445-1535), surnamed Rhyndacenus from the river Rhyndacus in Bithynia, his native province, was born about 1445. He was a member of the imperial family of Lascaris, and after the fall of Constantinople fled into Italy, where ultimately he found refuge at the court of Lorenzo de’ Medici, whose intermediary he was with the sultan Bajazet II. in the purchase of Greek MSS. for the Medicean library. On the expulsion of the Medici from Florence, he, at the invitation of Charles VIII. of France, removed to Paris (1495), where he taught publicly, although he does not appear to have had any official or salaried connexion with the university. Among his pupils were Gulielmus Budaeus and Danesius. By Louis XII. he was several times employed on various public missions; and in 1515 he appears to have accepted the invitation of Leo X. to take charge of the Greek college he had founded at Rome. We afterwards find Lascaris employed along with Budaeus by Francis I. in the formation of the royal library at Fontainebleau, and also again sent in the service of the French crown to Venice. He died at Rome in 1535.

He edited or wrote Anthologia Epigrammatum Graecorum, in seven books, Florence, 1494; Callimachi Hymni, cum Scholiis Graecis, Florence, about 1494; Scholia Graeca in Iliadem, in integrum restituta, Rome, 1517; Homericarum quaestionum liber, et de Nympharum antro in Odyssea opusculum, Rome, 1518; De vens Graecarum litterarum formis ac causis apud antiquos, Paris, 1536. See Jovius, Elogia clarorum virorum·, Hody, De Graecis Illustribus·, and Bayle’s Dictionary, s.v.
