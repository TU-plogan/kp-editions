LANDSHUT, chief town of a government district in Lower Bavaria, is situated on the right bank of the Isar, about 40 miles north-east of Munich. As the seat of government for the district, it contains all the appropriate administrative offices, and it is well supplied with educational and charitable institutions, besides having a convent and several nunneries. Of its numerous ecclesiastical buildings the most interesting are the churches of St Martin (with a spire 463 feet high), St Iodocus, and the Holy Ghost, all begun before 1411, and the old Dominican convent, now used as Government offices. The town-house, the former provincial buildings, and the palace are also noteworthy. On a hill commanding the town is the castle of Trausnitz, an ancient stronghold of the dukes of Lower Bavaria. The original castle was built in the 12th century, but the oldest part now extant dates from about 1304. In 1872-73 the upper part was put into habitable order by the king of [9:14:282] Bavaria. The manufactures of Landshut are not important; they include beer, cloth, and tobacco. Market gardening and, to a really considerable extent, trade in grain are carried on. From 1800 to 1826, when the university, formerly at Ingolstadt and now at Munich, was located at Landshut, the town woke up to a temporary importance. The name Dreihelm Stadt is sometimes given to Landshut from the three helmets that form its arms. The population in 1875 was 14,780.
