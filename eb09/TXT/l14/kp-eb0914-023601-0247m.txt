LAMBERT, Johann Heinrich (1728-1777), physicist and mathematician, was born at Mulhausen, Alsace, August 29, 1728. He was the son of a tailor; and the slight elementary instruction he obtained at the small free school of his native town was supplemented altogether by his own private reading. Having cultivated a good style of penmanship, he became book-keeper at Montbéliard ironworks, and subsequently (1745) secretary to Professor Iselin, the editor of a newspaper at Basel, who three years later recommended him as private tutor to the family of President A. von Salis of Coire. Coming thus into virtual possession of a good library, Lambert had peculiar opportunities for improving himself in his literary and scientific studies. In 1759, after completing with his pupils a lengthened tour of two years’ duration through Gδttingen, Utrecht, Paris, Marseilles, and Turin, he resigned his <utorship and settled at Augsburg. Munich, Erlangen, Coire, and Leipsic became for brief successive intervals his home. Finally in 1764 he removed to Berlin, where he received many favours at the hand of Frederick, was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and ultimately (1774) undertook the editing of the astronomical almanac. On September 25, 1777, he died of consumption, the natural result of a life spent in excessive application to all kinds of mental labour. Seventeen hours dιily were devoted by him to reading and writing; and, as might have been expected in the case of one who wrote so much, many of his numerous publications are of little permanent interest. Not a few, however, are very valuable, and show him to have been a man of original and active mind with a singular facility in applying mathematics to practical questions.

Lambert’s most important work, Pyrometric (Berlin, 1779), is a systematic treatise on heat, containing the records and full discussion of many of his own experiments. Worthy of special notice also are Photometria, Augsburg, 1760; Insigniores orbitae Cometarum proprietates, Augsburg, 1761; and Beiträge zum Gebrauche der Mathematik und deren Anwendung, 4 vols., Berlin, 1765-72.

The Memoirs of the Berlin Academy from 1761 to 1784 contain many of his papers, which treat of such subjects as resistance of fluids, magnetism, comets, probabilities, the problem of three bodies, meteorology, &c. In the Acta Helvetica (1752-60) and in the Nova Acta Erudita (1763-69) several of his contributions appear. In Bode’s Jahrbuch (1776-80) he discusses nutation, aberration of light, Saturn’s rings, and comets; in the Nova Acta Helvetica (1787) he has a long paper “Sur le Son des Corps Elastiques”; in Bernoulli and Hindenburg’s Magazin (1787-88) he treats of the roots of equations and of parallel lines; and in Hindenburg’s Archives (1798-99) he writes on optics and perspective. Many of these pieces were found among his effects after his death, and published posthumously. Recognized as among the first mathematicians of his day, he was also widely known for the universality and depth of his philological and philosophical knowledge. The most valuable of his logical and philosophical memoirs were published collectively in 2 vols., 1782. See Huber’s Lambert nach seinem Leben und Wirken.
