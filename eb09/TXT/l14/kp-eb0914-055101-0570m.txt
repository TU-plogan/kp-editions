LIBURNIANS were a people who at different times were prominent on the Adriatic coasts. They were originally, one cannot doubt, one of the homogeneous Illyrian tribes (see Illyria). Living in a barren rocky country along the north-eastern coast of the Adriatic, they devoted themselves to the sea, and were the chief navigators of the Adriatic in the early period. They settled on the coast of Picenum, where the town of Truentum was always counted Liburnian; and the Greek colonists found them at Corcyra and other places. They were pressed on all sides by other races, but were still a powerful people in the time of Î²cylax (Scyl., p. 7). The islands that lay along the coast were peopled by them and called by their name. They were a race of pirates, who used swift boats with a large sail. These Liburnian ships became famous when the Romans adopted them in several of their naval wars. The heavy and lofty ships that had been developed by the later Greek states proved unequal to the light and swift Liburnian boats. The country was incorporated by the Romans in the province of Dalmatia.
