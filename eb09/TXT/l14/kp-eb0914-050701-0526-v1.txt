LIBER and LIBERA, among the Romans, were a pair of deities, male and female, in whose worship two very different phases exist side by side. In the country feast of the vintage, and the city festival of March 17th called [9:14:508] Liberalia, we find purely Italian ceremonial unaffected by Greek religion. The country festival was a great merrymaking, where the first-fruits of the new must were offered to the gods. It was full of unbridled rejoicing, and characterized by the grossest symbolism, in honour of the fertility of nature. It is usual to refer the name Liber to the free unrestrained character of his worship. In the city festival, growing civilization had impressed a new character on the primitive religion, and connected it with the framework of society. At this time the youths laid aside the boy’s toga praetexta and assumed the man’s toga libera or virilis. Cakes οi far, honey, and oil (flibci) were offered to the two gods at this festival. Liber is often invoked as Liber Pater, and we find even the expression Jupiter Liber, taking us back to the primitive stage of religion when no divine hierarchy of gods had been elaborated, and when Liber and Libera were in the sphere of their cultus the sole god and goddess. Originally Liber is probably only an epithet of Jupiter.

At an early period the Hellenic religion of Demeter, common to all the Greek colonies of Italy and Sicily, spread to Rome; then Liber and Libera were identified with Dionysus and Persephone, and associated with another Italian goddess Ceres, who was identified with Demeter. At the order of the Sibylline books, a temple was built to these three deities near the Circus Flaminius the whole cultus was borrowed from the Greeks, down even to the terminology, and priestesses were brought from the Greek cities. The temple, Aedes Cereris, was founded by Aulus Postumius, 496 b.c., and dedicated by Spurius Cassius, 493 b.c. The chief festival of this cultus lasted eight days, from the 12th to the 19th of April; it was accompanied by games, called Ludi Cereales or Liberales. The plebeian aediles, appointed about the time when the temple was founded, were closely attached to it, and from that time plebeian liberty continued in intimate relation to the Aedes Cereris and the gods there worshipped.
