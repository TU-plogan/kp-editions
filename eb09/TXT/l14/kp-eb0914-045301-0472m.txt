LEO V., Flavius, surnamed The Armenian, served as general under Nicephorus I., but was banished for treachery in 811. Shortly afterwards he was recalled and appointed commander of the eastern army by Michael I. After gaining some distinction in war with the Arabs in 812, he accompanied his sovereign, in 813, on an expedition against Crum, king of the Bulgarians. Taking advantage of the disaffection of the army during a battle with the enemy near Adrianople, he withdrew with the forces under his command, leaving Michael to total defeat. Shortly afterwards he was crowned at Constantinople without opposition (813). In 814, and again in the following year, he inflicted decisive defeats upon the Bulgariacs. He then began to show great zeal against the image worshippers, but such was his severity that even his closest friend, Michael the Stammerer, who had done much to help him to the throne, ultimately turned against him. Michael was convicted of conspiracy and condemned to death, but by the intervention of his friends, who assassinated Leo in the palace chapel on Christmas Eve 820, was raised from prison to the throne.
