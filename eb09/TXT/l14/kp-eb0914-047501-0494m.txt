LESLEY, John (1527-1596), bishop of Ross, Scottish historian and statesman, was born in 1527. His father was Gavin Lesley, parson of Kingussie. He was educated at the university of Aberdeen, where he took the degree of M.A. In 1538 he obtained a dispensation permitting him to hold a benefice, notwithstanding his being a natural son, and in June 1546 he was made an acolyte in the cathedral church of Aberdeen, of which he was afterwards appointed a canon and prebendary. He also studied at Poitiers, at Toulouse, and at Paris, where he was made doctor of laws. In 1558 he was appointed official of Aberdeen, and in 1559 he was inducted into the parsonage and prebend of Oyne. At the Reformation Lesley became a champion of the Romish faith, and appeared on that side at the disputation held in Edinburgh in 1561, when Knox was one of his antagonists. He was one of the commissioners sent the same year to bring over the young Queen Mary to take the government of Scotland. He returned in her train, and was appointed a privy councillor, and in 1564 one of the senators of the college of justice. Shortly afterwards he was made abbot of Lindores, and in 1565 bishop of Ross. He was one of the sixteen commissioners appointed to revise the laws of Scotland, and the volume of the Acts of Parliament known as the Black Acts was, chiefly owing to his care, printed in 1566.

The bishop was one of the most steadfast friends of Queen Mary.^[1. An interesting account of his care of her during her illness at Jedburgh is given in Proc. Roy. Soc. Ant. Scot., vol. xv. p. 210. ] After the failure of the royal cause, and whilst Mary was a captive in England, Lesley continued to exert himself on her behalf. He was one of the commissioners at the conference at York in 1568. He appeared as her ambassador at the court of Elizabeth to complain of the injustice done to her, and when he found he was not listened to he laid plans for the escape of the queen. He also projected a marriage for her with the duke of Norfolk, which ended in the execution of that nobleman. For this he was put under the charge of the bishop of Ely, and afterwards imprisoned in the Tower of London. During his confinement he collected materials for his history of Scotland, with which his name is now chiefly known. In 1571 he presented the latter portion of this work, written in his own vernacular tongue, to Queen Mary to amuse her in her captivity. He also wrote for her use his Piae Consolationes, and the queen devoted some of the hours of her captivity to translating a portion of it into French verse.

In 1573 he was liberated from prison, but was banished from England. For two years he attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the assistance of Continental princes in favour of Queen Mary. While at Rome in 1578 he published his history De Origine, Moribus, et Rebus Gestis Scotorum, the Latinity of which is held only second to that of Buchanan. In 1579 he went to France, and was made suffragan and vicar-general of the archbishopric of Rouen by the Cardinal de Bourbon. Whilst visiting his diocese, however, he was thrown into prison, and had to pay 3000 pistoles to prevent his being given up to Elizabeth. During the remainder of the reign of Henry III. he lived unmolested, but on the accession of the Protestant Henry IV. he again fell into trouble. In 1590 he was thrown into prison, and had to purchase his freedom at the same expense as before. In 1593 he was made bishop of Coutances in Normandy, and had licence to hold the bishopric of Ross till he should obtain peaceable possession of the former see. Being tired of life, he retired at last to a monastery at Gurtenburg near Brussels, where he died in 1596.
