LACÉPÈDE, Bernard GermainÉtienne de la Ville, Comte de (1756-1825), French naturalist, was born at Agen in Guyenne, December 26, 1756. His education was carefully conducted by his father, and the early perusal of Buffon’s Natural History awakened an interest in that branch of study, which for the remainder of his life absorbed his chief attention. His leisure he devoted to music, in which, besides becoming a good performer on the piano and organ, he acquired considerable mastery of composition, two of his operas, which, however, were never published, meeting with the high approval of Gluck; and in 1781-85 he also brought out in two volumes his Poétique de la Musique. Meantime he wrote two treatises, Essai sur l' Électricité (1781) and Physique générale et particulière (1782-84), which gained him the friendship of Buffon, who in 1785 appointed him sub-demonstrator in the Jardin du Roi, and proposed to him to become the continuator of his Histoire Naturelle. This continuation was published under the titles Histoire des Quadrupèdes ovipares et des Serpents (2 vols., 1788-89) and Histoire Naturelle des Peptiles (1789). After the Revolution Lacépède became a member of the legislative assembly, but during the Reign of Terror he deemed it advisable to leave Paris, his life having become endangered by his disapproval of the massacres. When the Jardin du Roi was reorganized as the Jardin des Plantes Lacépède was appointed to the chair set apart to the history of reptiles and fishes, which he conducted with such success that in 1796 he was chosen a member of the Institute. Two years afterwards he published the first volume of Histoire Naturelle des Poissons, the 5th volume appearing in 1803; and in 1804 appeared Histoire des Cétacés. From this period till his death the part he took in politics prevented him from making any further contribution of importance to science. In 1799 he became a senator, in 1801 president of the senate, in 1803 grand chancellor of the legion of honour, in 1804 minister of state, and at the Restoration in 1819 he was created a peer of France. He died at Épinay, October 6,1825. During the latter period of his life he wrote Histoire générale physique et civile de l'Europe, which was published posthumously in 18 vols., 1826. A collected edition of his works on natural history was published in the same year, and has been frequently reprinted. See Ichthyology, vol xii. p. 633.
