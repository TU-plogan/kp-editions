LEEK, a market-town of Staffordshire, England, is situated on a fine eminence above the river Churnet, and on the Churnet Valley branch of the North Staffordshire Railway, 24 miles east-north-east of Stafford. Its streets [9:14:410] are wide and regular, and its sanitary and water arrangements are very complete. The church, dedicated to Saint Edward the Confessor, is in the Early English style. Much of the old building, erected in 1180, remains, but it has been frequently repaired, and in 1867 and 1875 underwent extensive restoration. In the vicinity of the town are the ruins of the Cistercian abbey De la Croix (known as Dieulacres), erected in 1214 by Ranulf de Blondeville, sixth earl of Chester. The grammar school was built in the beginning of last century by the earl of Macclesfield. The other principal buildings are the memorial cottage hospital for the county of Stafford, erected in 1870 from a private bequest, and the new town and market hall erected on the site of the old building. There is an important silk manufacture, and also agricultural implement works. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1881 was 12,865.

British and Roman remains have been found in the vicinity of Leek at various periods, and the town itself is of very great antiquity. For some centuries after the Conquest it was the property of the earls of Chester, but afterwards it was bestowed on the monks of the abbey De la Croix. It received a market from King John. On the 3d of December 1745 it was entered by the troops of the Pretender, and again on the 7th of the same month.
