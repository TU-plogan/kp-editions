LANSDOWNE, WilliamPetty Fitzmaurice, first Marquis of (1737-1805), better known as a statesman while earl of Shelburne, was born at Dublin, May 20, 1737. He was a descendant of the lords of Kerry, and his grandfather, who was created earl of Kerry, married a daughter of Sir William Petty. On the death without issue of Sir William Petty’s son, the first earl of Shelburne, the estates passed to his nephew John Fitzmaurice (afterwards advanced to the earldom of Shelburne), the father of the subject of the present notice. The latter spent his childhood “in the remotest parts of the south of Ireland,” and, according to his own account, when at the age of sixteen he entered Christ Church, Oxford, he had both “everything to learn and everything to unlearn.” From a tutor whom he describes as “narrow-minded” he received advantageous guidance in his studies, but he attributes [9:14:290] his improvement in manners and in knowledge of the world chiefly to the fact, that, as was his t '∙ fate through life,” he fell in “with clever but unpopular connexions.” Shortly after leaving the university he served as an officer in Wolfe’s regiment during the Seven Years’ War, and so distinguished himself at Minden and Kloster-Kampen that he was raised to the rank of colonel and appointed aide-de-camp to the king. Being thus brought into near communication with Lord Bute, he was in 1761 employed by that nobleman to negotiate for the support of Charles Fox. For a few months in the same year he sat in the House of Commons as member of Wycombe, until he succeeded his father as earl of Shelburne in the Irish peerage, and Baron Wycombe in the peerage of Great Britain. Though he declined to take office under Bute he undertook negotiations to induce Fox to gain the consent of the Commons to the peace of 1763. Fox affirmed that he had been duped by the terms offered, and, although Shelburne always asserted that he had acted in thorough good faith, Bute spoke of the affair as a “pious fraud.” Shelburne joined the Grenville ministry in 1763 as president of the Board of Trade, but, failing in his efforts to replace Pitt in the cabinet, he in a few months resigned office. Having moreover on account of his support of Pitt on the question of Wilke’s expulsion from the House of Commons incurred the serious displeasure of the king, he retired for a time to his estate. After Pitt’s return to power in 1766 he became secretary of state, but during Pitt’s illness his conciliatory policy towards America was completely thwarted by his colleagues and the king, and iι> 1768 he was dismissed from office. In 1782 he consented to take office under the marquis of Rockingham on condition that the king would agree to recognize the United States, and on the death of Lord Rockingham in the same year, he became premier; but the secession of Fox and his supporters led to the famous coalition of Fox with North, which caused his resignation in the following February, his fall being perhaps hastened by his proposed plans for the reform of the public service. He had also in contemplation a bill to promote free commercial intercourse between England and the United States. When Pitt acceded to office in 1784, Shelburne, instead of receiving a place in the cabinet, was created marquis of Lansdowne. Though giving a general support to the policy of Pitt, he from this time ceased to take an active part in public affairs. He died May 7, 1805.

During his lifetime the marquis of Lansdowne was blamed for insincerity and duplicity, but the accusations came chiefly from those who were dissatisfied with his preference of principles to party, and it is beyond doubt that, if he had had a more unscrupulous regard to his personal ambition, his career as a statesman would have had more outward success. His autobiography indicates that he was cynical in his estimates of character, but no statesman of his time possessed more enlightened political views, while his friendship with those of his contemporaries eminent in science and literature must be allowed considerable weight in qualifying our estimate of the moral defects with which he has been credited. See Fitzmaurice, Life of William, Earl of Shelburne, 3 vols., London, 1875-76.
