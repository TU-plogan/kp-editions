LEON, a city of Mexico, in the state of Guanajuato, the chief town of a department, and in population second only to the capital of the republic, from which it is distant about 100 miles. It is situated on the right bank of the Rio Torbio, in the midst of a fertile and flourishing region, and is altogether one of the best built and most prosperous places in the country, with a large trade in grain and other agricultural produce, and a number of considerable industries—cotton and woollen weaving, tanning, and saddlery. For some time Leon has aspired to become the chief town of a new state, and even to take the place of Mexico as the national capital. The opening of the railways south-east to Mexico and north-east to the Rio Grande will further stimulate its development. The foundation of Leon dates from 1576, and it has ranked as a city since 1836, but the beginning of its present prosperity belongs only to the middle of the century.
