LAMEGO, a town in the district of Vizeu in the province of Beira, Portugal, is situated 6 miles south of the Douro, and about 50 miles east of Oporto. As the seat of a bishop, it contains a Gothic cathedral, a part of which is referred to the 14th century. One of the churches was [9:14:239] formerly a Moorish mosque, and, though intrinsically commonplace, enjoyed for a long time an undeserved fame as the meeting place of the cortes said to have been convened in 1143 or 1144 by Alphonso Henriquez, the first king of Portugal, to settle the royal succession and to determine the laws of the country. But within the last forty years it has been pretty clearly demonstrated that no such cortes ever met. To archaeologists the ancient bath preserved at Lamego will afford more interest than the old Moorish castle, which crowns the hill on which the city stands. Numbers of swine are reared in the neighbourhood, which furnish the well-known Lisbon hams. The old name of Lamego was Lama or Lamacoeni. Under the Moors, who were driven out in 1038 by Ferdinand of Castile, it was a leading city. The population in 1878 was 8383.
