LEDRU-ROLLIN, Alexandre Auguste (1807-1874), was the grandson of a celebrated quack-doctor of the reign of Louis XV., who took the name of Cornus, and made a large fortune in curing or attempting to cure epilepsy by magnetism. He himself was born in the house of Scarron at Fontenay-aux-Roses, on February 2, 1807, was educated at Paris, and had just been entered at the Paris bar, when the revolution of July 1830 broke out. He soon made himself a great name as an advocate, and was engaged on the republican side in all the great political trials of the next ten years. He also wrote many political tracts, and edited more than one republican newspaper, so that when he was elected as deputy for Le Mans in 1841 he was expected to take up an advanced republican position in the chamber. From this time to the outbreak of the revolution of February 1848 he was regarded as the chosen leader of the working men of France, and spoke and wrote in favour of liberty of labour and universal suffrage. It was in the speeches of himself and his friends Lamartine and Louis Blanc at Lille, Dijon, and Chalons at working men’s banquets during the latter months of 1847 that the revolution of 1848 was most clearly foreshadowed and prepared. When it did actually break out, it was Ledru-Rollin who overthrew the project of making the duchess of Orleans regent, and obtained the nomination of a provisional government. In this provisional government he was clearly pointed out by his influence among the working men for the ministry of the interior. When he resigned on June 24, 1848, he found that his four months of office had lost him his old leadership, as the conscientious performance of such an office inevitably would, but he had the credit of having for the first time established a working system of universal suffrage. He tried to regain his old influence, but in vain, and at the election of president in December had but 370,000 votes. The earlier months of 1849 he spent in protesting against the policy, especially the Roman policy, of the president Louis Napoleon Bonaparte and his ministry, which culminated in his moving their impeachment. His motion being defeated on June 12 by 289 to 8, he on June 13 headed what he called a peaceful demonstration, and his enemies an appeal to arms, which was soon dispersed. Ledru-Rollin himself escaped to London, where he signed the manifestoes of the revolutionary committee of Europe with Kossuth, Mazzini, Rüge, and sometimes Desatz. He also employed his leisure in writing a work on the Decadence el’ Angleterre, in which he attempted to deduce the necessary fall of England from its aristocratic form of government and the misery of the lower classes. In 1870 he returned to Paris, but though elected in three departments he refused to sit in the national assembly of 1871. In 1874 he consented to sit for the department of Var, and spoke at length on J une 3 on an electoral scheme, upholding the one great aim and achievement of his life, universal suffrage. The effort was too much for his health; he steadily grew weaker and weaker, and died on December 31, 1874. Perhaps the best succinct description of his character and political position in the sixteen short months of his real [9:14:399] power is to be found in the speech of Victor Hugo at the unveiling of his bust in Père La Chaise: “Louis Blanc was the apostle of the revolution of February, Lamartine the orator, and Ledru-Rollin the tribune.”

The Discours politiques et écrits divers of Ledru-Rollin were published by his widow in 1879; his Décadence d'Angleterre was published in 1850; and an account of his political position is to be found in all histories of the revolution of 1848.
