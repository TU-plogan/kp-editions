+====================================================================+


L’HÔPITAL, or L’Hospital, Michel de (c. 1505-1573), chancellor of France from 1560 to 1568, was born near Aigueperse in Auvergne (now Puy-de-Dôme) about the year 1505. His father, who was physician and comptroller of accounts to the constable Charles de Bourbon, sent him to study at Toulouse, whence at the age of eighteen he was driven by the evil fortunes of the family patron, after suffering arrest and imprisonment, to Padua, in which university he studied law and letters for about six years. On the completion of his studies he joined his father at Bologna, and afterwards, the constable having died, went to Rome in the suite of Charles V. For some time he held the position of auditor of the rota at Rome, but in 1534, encouraged by the fair promises of Cardinal de [9:14:504] Grammont, he returned to France. The death of his patron soon afterwards seriously impaired his prospects; but after he had entered himself of the Parisian bar, his marriage, in 1537, to a daughter of the lieutenant-criminel procured for him the post of counsellor to the parliament of Paris. This office he held until 1547, when he was sent by Henry II. on a mission to Bologna, where the council of Trent was at that time sitting; after sixteen months of wearisome inactivity there, he was by his own desire recalled at the close of 1518. L’Hôpital now for some time held the position of “chancellor” in the household of the princess Margaret, duchess of Berri, and in 1554 he was made superintendent of the royal finances. In 1559 he accompanied his mistress, now duchess of Savoy, to Nice, where, on the following year, tidings reached him that he had been chosen to succeed Olivier in the chancellorship of France. One of his first acts after entering on the duties of his office (in July 1560) was to cause the parliament of Paris to register the edict of Romorantin, of which he is sometimes, but erroneously it would seem, said to have been the author. Designed as it was to protect so-called heretics from the secret and summary methods of the Inquisition, it certainly had his sympathy and approval. In accordance with the consistent policy of inclusion and toleration by which the whole of his official life was characterized, he induced the council to call the Assembly of Notables, which met at Fontainebleau in August 1G60 and agreed that the States General should be summoned, all proceedings against heretics being meanwhile suppressed, pending the reformation of the church by a general or national council. The States General met in December; the edict of Orleans (July 1561) followed, and finally, after the colloquy of Poissy, that of January 1562, the most liberal (except that of Nantes) ever obtained by the Protestants of France. Its terms, however, were not carried out, and during the war which was the inevitable result of the massacre of Vassy in May, L’Hôpital, whose dismissal had been for some time urged by the papal legate Hippolytus of Este, found it necessary to retire to his estate at Vignay near Étampes, whence he did not return until after the pacification of Amboise (March 19, 1563). It was by his advice that Charles IX. was declared of age (August 17, 1563) at Rouen, a measure which really increased the power of Catherine de’ Medici; and it was under his influence also that the parliament of Paris in 1564 refused to sanction the publication of the acts of the council of Trent, on account of their inconsistency with the Gallican liberties. In 1564-66 he accompanied the young king on an extended tour through France; and in 1566 he was instrumental in the promulgation of an important edict for reform of abuses in the administration of justice. The renewal of the religious war in September 1567, however, was at once a symptom and a cause of diminished influence to L’Hôpital, and in February 1568 he obtained his letters of discharge, which were registered by the parliament on May 11, his titles, honours, and emoluments being reserved to him during the remainder of his life. Henceforward he lived a life of unbroken literary seclusion at Vignay, his only subsequent public appearance being by means of a “mémoire” which he addressed to the king in 1570 under the title Le but de la guerre et de la paix, ou Discours du chancelier H Hospital pour exhorter Charles IX. à donner la paix à ses subjects. Though not exempt from considerable danger, he passed in safety through the troubles of the St Bartholomew, but did not long survive them. His death took place either at Vignay or at Bélesbat (Courdimanche, Etampes) on March 13, 1573.

After his death Pibrac, assisted by De Thou and Scévole de Sainte-Marthe, collected a volume of the Pοemata of L’Hôpital, and in 1585 his grandson published Epistolarum seu Sermonum libri sex. The complete Oeuvres de l'Ηbpital were published for the first time by Dufey (5 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1824-25). They include his “Harangues” and “liemonstrances,” the Epistles, the Mémoire to Charles IX., a Traité de la Reformation de la Justice, and the will of L’Hôpital. Haag {France Prot., vii. p. 83) gives the titles of several MSS. still unpublished. Villemain wrote a Vie de L'Hôpital, which has recently been reprinted (1874), and there are monographs also by Taillandier (1861) and by Dupré-Lasal (1875).
