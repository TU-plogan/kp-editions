LANDAU, the chief town of an official district in the Palatinate of the Rhine, Bavaria, is situated on the Queich, about 18 miles north-west of Carlsruhe. 4mong its various interesting buildings are the Gothic church, dating from 1285, and the monastery, founded in 1276, and now converted into a brewery. There is a considerable trade, and some manufacture. The population in 1875 was 7579.

Landau was taken no less than seven times in the Thirty Yearsâ€™ War. At the peace of Westphalia it was ceded to the French, and was generally held by France till 1815, when it was restored to Germany; in 1816 it was annexed to Bavaria. In 1871 its fortifications were finally destroyed.
