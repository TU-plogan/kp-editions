LANTERN-FLY, a name applied to certain insects belonging to the Homopterous division of the order Hemiptera, which may be broadly placed in the genus Fulgora, although this is now subdivided into many genera. They are mostly large insects, and gaily coloured, remarkable for the forehead being produced into the semblance of a snout or muzzle (often upturned at the tip), the so-called “lantern.” This snout is hollow, and is merely an inflated production of the head. Much interest, as well as mystery, has surrounded these insects, originating in a statement by Madame Merian in her work on the insects of Surinam (Metamorphosis insectorum Surinamensium, &c.), of which the first edition appears to have been published in 1705, [9:14:291] but which subsequently passed through many editions with varying titles and in several languages. Madame Merian stated that the common South American species, now known as Fulgora laternaria, L., was highly luminous at night, so much so that she was enabled to read by the light of one only, and that when several were confined together the interior of the box appeared all ablaze. No one doubted these statements, and the illustrious Linnaeus used the words “Prominente fronte noctu lucem vivacissimam spargit” in diagnosing the insect in his Systema Naturae. Moreover, it was believed that, because one species had been asserted to be luminous, others allied thereto must possess the same power; the specific names used by Linnaeus, such as Candelaria, phosphorea, noctivida, lucernaria, and flammea, may be adduced as instances. Of these one only, the F. Candelaria of China, has become (with the original laternaria) a subject of controversy, for it also was asserted to be luminous. As time wore on many intelligent naturalists and other travellers visited both South America and China, and they concluded that the light must be produced only under very exceptional conditions, or that the original statement was an error, for they could not detect any luminosity, nor, as a rule, was such a property believed in by the natives of the regions. Quite recently many naturalists of undoubted authority have resided for years in the districts where these insects occur without having ^personally detected luminosity (though directly in search of it), and without obtaining any indications of the existence of such a belief in the minds of the natives. On the other hand, there have been a few travellers who have professed to be able to confirm Madame Merian’s statements, both from personal observation and from information derived from native sources. Possibly the last of these was within the last twenty years, and his assertion concerned F. Candelaria, and upon his statement an entomologist of repute, lately deceased, maintained to the last his belief in the luminous powers. With him all faith in this direction has probably passed away. It is not for us to attempt to define the reasons for Madame Merian’s positive and circumstantial statements. The preponderance of negative testimony is so crushingly great that Fulgora may be regarded as eliminated from the category of luminous insects.
