LAMBÈSE, or Lambessa, the ancient Lambaesa and the Tazzut or Tezzulet of the natives, is situated in the French province of Constantine in Algeria, about 6 miles east of Batna. The modern village is well known for its great convict establishment (founded about 1850); and the remains of the Roman town, and more especially of the Roman camp, in spite of the wanton vandalism to which they have been more than once subjected since their discovery, are among the most interesting in northern Africa. The ruins of the town are situated on the lower terraces of the Jebel Aures, and consist of triumphal arches, temples, aqueducts, and an immense quantity of ordinary masonry evidently belonging to private houses. To the north and east lie extensive cemeteries with the stones still standing in their original alignments; to the west is a similar area from which, however, the stones have been largely removed for building the modern village. Of the temples the most noteworthy are those to Aesculapius and Health (Salus), and to Isis and Serapis. About two-thirds [9:14:238] of a mile from the town on the level ground of the plain of Batna stands the camp. It measures 1640 feet from north to south by 1476 feet from east to west, and in the middle rise the ruins of a praetorium. This noble building is 92 feet long by 66 feet broad and 49 feet high; its southern façade has a splendid peristyle half the height of the wall, consisting of a front row of massive Ionic columns and an engaged row of Corinthian pilasters. The ruins of both city and camp have yielded a rich harvest of inscriptions (Renier edited 1500, and there are 4185 in the Corpus Inscr. Lat., vol. viii.); and, though a very large proportion are epitaphs of the barest kind, the more important pieces supply a fair outline of the history of the place.

Lambaesa was emphatically a military foundation. The camp of the third legion (Legio III. Augusta), to which it owes its origin, appears to have been established between 123 and 129 a.d., in the time of Hadrian, whose address to his soldiers was found inscribed on a pillar in a second camp to the west of the great camp still extant. By 166 mention is made of the decurions of a vicus, 10 curiae of which are known by name; and the vicus became a municipium probably at the time when it was made the capital of the newly founded province of Numidia. The legion was removed by Gordianus, but restored by Valerianus and Gallienus; and its final departure did not take place till after 392. The town soon afterwards declined. It never became the seat of a bishop, and no Christian inscriptions have been found among the ruins.
