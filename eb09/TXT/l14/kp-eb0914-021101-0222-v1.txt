LAGRENÉE, Louis Jean François (1724-1805), French painter, was a pupil of Carle Vanloo. Born at Paris 30th December 1724, in 1755 he became a member of the Academy, presenting as his diploma picture the Rape of Deianira (Louvre). He visited St Petersburg at the call of the empress Elizabeth, and on his return was named in 1781 director of the French Academy at Rome; he there painted the Indian Widow, one of his best-known works. His pictures, which have nearly all been engraved, are frequently to be met with out of France. In 1804 Napoleon conferred on him the cross of the legion of honour, and on 19th June 1805 he died in the Louvre, of which he was honorary keeper.
