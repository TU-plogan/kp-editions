LIÈGE (Germ., Lüttich·, Dutch, Luik; Walloon, Lige-, usually Latinized as Leodium), a city of Belgium, the chief town of the province of Liége, is situated in 50° 39' N. lat. and 5° 3Γ E. long., 56 miles east of Brussels (62J by rail), and 16 miles south-south west of Maestricht. It occupies a remarkably fine position on the banks of the Meuse, which at this point is joined by the Ourthe. On the left-hand side stands the older city with the citadel and the more important historical buildings; on the right hand lies the lower and more modern portion, commanded by the fort of the Chartreuse. The river, there 460 feet across, is spanned by several bridges, of which the Pont des [9:14:569] Arches, rebuilt in 1860-63, dates originally from the 8th century, and plays a prominent part in the local annals. Place St Lambert is the historical centre of Liege. Here still stands the noble building—erected (1508-40) by Cardinal de la Marek in a late Gothic style—which down to the revolution was the palace of the prince-bishops, and is now with its modern extensions occupied by the public courts and other administrative offices. And here, till it was ruined by the revolutionists in 1794, and completely removed in 1808, stood the old cathedral of St Lambert, originally founded in 712, and rebuilt after a great fire at the close of the 12th century. The rank of cathedral was in 1802 transferred to the abbey-church of St Paul, the foundation of which is assigned to 968, though the nave is no older than the 16th century, and the choir belongs to 1280. The stained glass and the wood carving of the pulpit by Geefs deserve particular mention. Other churches of note are St Jacques, a fine Gothic building founded in 1016, with a Romanesque west tower and a polygonal choir; St Barthélemy, a completely modernized basilica of the 12th century; St Martin, founded in 962 and rebuilt in the middle of the 16th century; and the Holy Cross, founded by Notker in 979, with a west choir dating from the 12th century, and the east choir and nave from the 14th. The university of Liège, established in 1817, is a flourishing institution with about 40 professors and 800 students, a library of 100,000 volumes, a botanic garden (1819, formerly the Jesuits’ garden), a school of mines (1825), a school of arts and manufactures, a normal grammar school, and several other auxiliary foundations. There is no theological faculty,—the theological seminary, with a large library of its own, being an independent institution. The city further possesses a blind asylum, a deaf and dumb institute, schools of design, painting, and music, a zoological garden, a municipal museum, &c. The Place d’Avroi is adorned by an equestrian statue of Charlemagne by Jehotte; and in front of the theatre stands a bronze statue of Gretry, the composer, who was born at Liège.

Liège is the centre of a great mining district rich in coal, lead, zinc, and iron; the coal-mines extend under the city and the river. In 1879 358,100 tons of coal were raised in the province, 22,156 persons being employed in the pits. The iron, lead, and zinc foundries in the town ami neighbourhood work up large quantities of ore in addition to the. local supply. Steel, copper, and tin wares, steam-engines and general machinery, woollen goods, excellent saws and files, nails, needles, mirrors, clocks, leather, paper, and oil are among the products of the versatile industry of the place. Liège firearms have long enjoyed a wide reputation. They give employment to about 30,000 workmen, who for the most part work in their own houses, though in 1878 a large factory was erected in the American style for making all parts of the weapon by machinery. In 1878 183,806 single-barrelled guns, 113,121 double-barrelled guns, 403,649 revolvers, 19,395 saddle pistols, and about 85,000 army weapons, ke., were passed by Liège through the Government testing office. The trade of Liege is favoured by the fact that the town is an important junction on the Rhenish Belgian Railway, commands more than one navigable river, and has long been one of the leading cattle-markets in the country. The population was 115,956 in 1874.

About 720 the bishops of Tongres, after oscillating between Tongres and Maestricht, settled at Liège, though they did not take the title bishop of Liège for more than two centuries. Their church of St Lambert received large territorial endowments, and in the 14th century they became princes of the empire. For centuries the straggle was maintained between episcopal tyranny and civic independence; and ducal and imperial armies were called in to crush the insurrections. In this way Charles the Bold of Burgundy made himself master of the city in 1467, and again with much bloodshed and barbarity in 1468. Bishop Ferdinand in 1650 and Bishop Maximilian in 1684 were each imposed on the citizens by force of arms, and kept them down by means of a strong citadel and foreign soldiers. In 1691 Liège was bombarded for five days by Marshal de Bouffiers; in 1702 Marlborough took the citadel by storm from a French garrison; and in 1792 the town was the scene of a great defeat of the Austrians by the French.
