LISBURN, a market-town, cathedral city, and municipal and parliamentary borough of Ulster, Ireland, partly in Antrim and partly in Down, is situated in a beautiful and fertile district on the Lagan, and on the Ulster Railway, 8 miles south-south-west of Belfast. It is substantially built, and consists principally of one long and irregular street, in the centre of which there is a large open space for the market. The parish church, which possesses a fine octagonal tower, is the cathedral church of the united dioceses of Down, Connor, and Dromore, and contains a monument to Jeremy Taylor, who was bishop of the see. Among other buildings are the court-house, the markethouse, the linen-hall, and the county infirmary. There are a number of charitable foundations. The staple manufacture of the town is linen, specially damasks and muslins. There are also bleaching and dyeing works. The population in 1871 was 9326, and in 1881 it was 10,834.

In the reign of James I. Lisburn, which was then known as Lisnegarvy, was only an inconsiderable village, but in 1627 it was granted by Charles I. to Viscount Conway, who erected the castle for his residence, and laid the foundation of the prosperity of the town by the introduction of English and Welsh settlers. In November 1641 the town was taken by the insurgents, who on the approach of superior numbers set fire to it. The troops of Cromwell gained a victory near the town in 1648, and the castle surrendered to them in 1650. The church was constituted a cathedral by Charles II., from whom the town received the privilege of returning two members to parliament, but since the Union it has returned, only one.
