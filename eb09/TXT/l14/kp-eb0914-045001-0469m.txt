LEO X. (Giovanni de’ Medici, 1475-1523), the only pope who has bestowed his own name upon his age, and one of the few whose original extraction has corresponded in some measure with the splendour of the pontifical dignity, was the second son of Lorenzo de’ Medici, called the Magnificent, and was born at Florence, December 11, 1475. Like his contemporary Henry VIII., he was from the first destined for the ecclesiastical condition; he received the tonsure at seven, held benefices at eight, and ere he was thirteen negotiations were in active progress for his elevation to the cardinalate. Innocent VIII., the reigning pope, was bound to Lorenzo by domestic ties and a common policy and interest; in October 1488 Giovanni was created a cardinal under the condition that he should not be publicly recognized as such for three years. The interval was devoted to the study of theology and canon law, pursuits less congenial to the young prince of the church than the elegant literature for which he inherited his father’s taste, and in which he had already made great progress under the tuition of Politian and Bibbiena. In March 1492 he was formally admitted into the sacred college, and took up his residence in Rome, receiving a letter of advice from his parent which ranks among the wisest and weightiest compositions of its class. Within a few months his prospects were clouded by the nearly simultaneous decease of his father and the pope, a double bereavement closing the era of peace which Lorenzo’s prudent policy had given to Italy, and inaugurating a period of foreign invasion and domestic strife. One of the first consequences of the French irruption into Italy, which shortly ensued, was the expulsion of the Medici family from Florence (November 1494). After having resisted to the best of his ability, the Cardinal de’ Medici found a refuge at Bologna, and, seeing himself deprived for the time of political importance, and obnoxious to Innocent’s successor, Alexander VI., undertook a journey in foreign countries with a party of friends. Upon his return he settled at Rome, withdrawing himself from notice as much as possible, and disarming the jealousy of Alexander by his unaffected devotion to literary pursuits. The accession of Julius II., and the death of his elder brother Piero in the battle of the Garigliano (December 1503), restored him to consequence; but little is recorded of him until 1511, when Julius appointed him legate at Bologna, an office which gave him the nominal direction of the combined Spanish and papal army then besieging that city. The siege failed, and two months afterwards the allies were totally defeated by the French under Gaston de Foix in the famous battle of Ravenna (April 11, 1512), and the Cardinal de’ Medici himself was taken prisoner. The French victory produced none of the anticipated results; within a short time the conquerors were even obliged to evacuate Milan, carrying their captive with them. In the confusion of the retreat the cardinal effected his escape, and fled to Mantua, where he derived encouragement from the prediction of a chiromancer, who promised him the papacy (Gauricus, Tractat. Astroh, fol. 20, a passage overlooked by Leo’s biographers). Being reappointed to his legation, he took quiet possession of Bologna; within a few months his family were restored to Florence by the Spanish and papal troops, and the death of Julius II., on February 21, 1513, raised him most unexpectedly to the papacy on March 11 following, at the age of only thirtyseven years. It seems difficult to assign any adequate reason for an election so contrary to traditional observance and the private interests of all the more conspicuous members of the conclave; but it has never been attributed to simony. The new pope assumed the name of Leo X. Before his coronation, as first pointed out by Lord Acton, he was required to enter into certain engagements, from most of which he speedily absolved himself. Among these was a promise to issue no brief for collecting money for the repair of St Peter’s. Had this pledge been observed, the Reformation might have been deferred for some time, and its course might have been materially different.

At Leo’s accession the probability of a religious revolution was contemplated by none. The attention of his immediate predecessors had long been engrossed by the temporal concerns of the papacy. These were apparently in a flourishing, but actually in a precarious condition. The guiding principle of Leo’s policy was to preserve the conquests which he had inherited from Alexander VI. and Julius II. The establishment of his family in Florence diminished, although it did not remove, the temptation to create a principality in their interest, as Alexander had done, and his temper rather inclined him to aggrandize the papacy by diplomacy than to emulate the martial exploits of Julius. The preservation, however, of the acquisitions of these pontiffs required and taxed the abilities of a consummate statesman. These were not wanting to Leo, and it is to his credit that he seldom suffered the love of art and letters, which was his ruling passion, and which became his especial distinction among the princes of his age, to divert his attention from public affairs at a time of extraordinary anxiety and vicissitude. Scarcely had he ascended the pontifical throne when the storm burst in the shape of a determined effort of the French king to repossess himself of the duchy of Milan.
[9:14:451]

An army of Swiss, called into the field by Leo’s diplomacy, repelled the invasion, and Italy enjoyed peace until the death of Louis XIL, two years subsequently, brought to the throne a young prince who only lived for military glory, and whose entire reign was dominated by the ambition of recovering Milan and Naples. On September 13, 1515, Francis I. totally defeated the Swiss at Marignano. One of the first consequences of the battle, which reduced Leo to submission by placing the Medici in Florence at the mercy of the victor, was the loss of Parma and Piacenza. These duchies, but recently acquired by Julius II., were reunited to Milan, and Leo, temporizing in the true spirit of Italian statecraft, consented to a public interview with Francis, and became apparently his ally. Little as the pope’s professions were to be depended upon, Francis thus gained the substantial advantage of a concordat seriously restricting the liberties of the Church of France. Leo meanwhile endeavoured to indemnify himself for the loss of Parma and Piacenza by seizing upon the duchy of Urbino for the benefit of his nephew Lorenzo, an enterprise fully as unscrupulous as any of the similar exploits of Caesar Borgia, and by no means executed with equal ability. After a severe struggle, however, Leo’s arms triumphed for the time, but the undertaking proved as injurious to his credit as to his exchequer, and the financial exhaustion which it occasioned helped to prepare the great disaster of his reign. Another unfortunate occurrence of this period was a plot of several cardinals to poison the pope, which led to the execution of one and the imprisonment of several others. Leo has been accused of excessive severity, but apparently without reason, although he may be censured for having held out expectations of pardon which he did not intend to fulfil. This conspiracy probably made him distrustful of the sacred college as then constituted, and led to one of the most remarkable acts of his pontificate, the creation of thirty-one cardinals in a single day. This dangerous stretch of authority made him absolute master in his own court for the remainder of his reign, and it must be admitted that most of the new cardinals were men of distinguished merit. A much more momentous event was now at hand, which, however, belongs more properly to the biography of Luther than that of Leo. On All Saints’ eve, 1517, the daring protest of Luther against the intolerable impostures and rapacity of the papal vendors of indulgences, commissioned by Leo to raise money for the rebuilding of St Peter’s, gave the signal for the Reformation. Leo was at first amused. “The axe,” he said, alluding to the danger he had lately escaped from, the conspiracy of the cardinals, “is taken from the root, and laid to the branches.” When at length his eyes were opened he followed the policy of mingled menace and cajolery which was alone possible where the secular arm was unavailable, and which might probably have succeeded with a man of different mould from Luther. By 1520 the breach had become irreparable, and an invincible fatality had linked the name of the most ostentatious of the popes with the profoundest humiliation of the church.

Leo died before the full extent of the calamity was apparent, and amid a full tide of political prosperity which would have easily consoled him for the diminution of his spiritual prerogatives. He had profited by the general tranquillity to expel the petty tyrants of the ecclesiastical states. Perugia, Sinigaglia, Fermo had been added to the domains of the church, and Ferrara had narrowly escaped. The death of his nephew Lorenzo about the same time made him the virtual ruler of Florence also. Abroad, his policy had apparently received a check by the election of Charles V. as emperor, but the continued rivalry between Charles and his competitor Francis soon placed the dearest wish of his heart within his reach. “Could I recover Parma and Piacenza for the church,” he had said to the Cardinal de’ Medici, “I would willingly lay down my life.” His wish was granted him. Allying himself with Charles, he contributed efficaciously to the expulsion of the French from Milan in November 1521. Parma and Piacenza returned to the Holy See, and there was talk of the Medici replacing the Sforzas on the ducal throne of Milan. The news reached Leo at his villa of Malliana on a November night. Overjoyed, his mind engrossed by ambitious projects, he long paced a chamber through whose open window streamed the chill and malarious air of the adjoining woods. He returned to Rome in apparent health, but on the 24th of November withdrew indisposed to his apartments, and on December 1 expired with such suddenness that the last sacraments could not be administered. Poison was generally suspected, but the circumstances alleged in support of this belief wear the aspect of inventions, and seem inconsistent with the universal dismay excited by his decease. There was more ground for this consternation than men fully knew. The most fortunate and magnificent of the popes had bequeathed his successors a religious schism and a bankrupt exchequer. If, however, his profusion had impoverished the church and indirectly occasioned the destruction of her visible unity, he had raised her to the highest rank as the apparent patron of whatever contributed to extend knowledge or to refine and embellish life. If he had not kindled the genius of Raphael, employed equally by his predecessor, he had recognized and fostered it, and in so doing had apparently reconciled antique art with Christianity, and effaced the reproach of indifference or hostility to culture which for fifteen centuries had more or less weighed upon the latter. As a patron of literature Leo’s merits had been even more conspicuous: every Italian man of letters, in an age of singular intellectual brilliancy, had tasted or might have hoped to taste of his bounty; had Italy been Europe, the scholars and authors elsewhere forward in revolt would have been indissolubly attached to the Church of Rome. The essential paganism of the Renaissance art and literature was not then perceived; and even now that it is fully understood the prestige which Leo gave the church remains but little impaired. The hostility of the Renaissance to Catholicism has been unanswerably shown by Catholic writers themselves, but the popular imagination only notes that Raphael and Michelangelo wrought in the name of religion, and at the bidding of a pope. However severely then Leo may be judged from the strictly sacerdotal point of view, sacerdotalism itself cannot deny its obligations to him; while, from the point of view of liberal culture, he appears as near perfection in his ecclesiastical character as that character admits.

His personal disposition has been the subject of much controversy. “Among all the individuals who have attracted the attention of mankind, there is perhaps no one whose character has stood in so doubtfid a light as that of Leo X.” This exaggerated dictum of Roscoe’s at all events expresses the fact that men’s views of Leo’s character have been coloured in a more than ordinary degree by party spirit. To one class he represents the ideal of the papacy as a civilizing and beneficent institution; to another—comprising Oatholics as well as Protestants—he is the personification of its worldliness and apostacy. The merit or demerit of his actions will be variously estimated to the end of time. The leading traits of his character, however, are matters of fact, which prepossessions should not be allowed to distort, and it may be confidently affirmed that they were mostly amiable and laudable. He was constitutionally kind, compassionate, and bountiful,—endowed with Florentino prudence and circumspection, but cast altogether in a more liberal mould than the mercantile race from which he sprung. The best of the Medici except his father Lorenzo, he is in many points more humanly.interesting than the latter, and the disadvantage at which he occasionally appears is mainly attributable to his being less perfectly equipped by nature for the part assigned to him by fortune. His geniality sometimes degenerated into indecorum, and [9:14:452] in a certain degree injured the credit of the church. His aesthetic pantheism, though inspired by a real religious sentiment, fixed the reproach of paganism upon her at the precise moment when an evangelical reaction was springing up. The best possible pope for the age that was going out, he was the worst possible for the age that was coming in: hence the splendours of his administration were ephemeral, and its disasters lasting. If his reputation as a pope and a statesman is thus ambiguous, no such deduction need be made from his serener fame as a patron of letters and art. In this respect he stands almost alone, except for such rare examples as his father and the modern kings of Bavaria, as a prince who di I not merely strike a tacit bargain with men of genius, setting his patronage against their flattery, but one who entered into their pursuits from a genuine congeniality of taste and temperament, and aided them efficaciously not only as their patron but as their companion. Unlike most exalted patrons of literature, he was a scholar first and a sovereign afterwards; hence his contact with the best intellect of his age was far more direct and personal than that of an Augustus or a Louis XIV. Great as were the obligations conferred u])on individuals by his tact and discernment, it is no doubt true that the intellectual movement of his age arose and could well have subsisted without him. It is none the less true that, if not the source of that light, his court was the focus to which it converged, and which gave it back with a lustre which still renders rhe era that bears his name, in its literary and artistic aspects, one of the brightest periods in the history of mankind.

Ths life of Leo was written shortly after his death by Paolo Giovio, bishop of Nocera, who had known him intimately. Roscoe’s celebrated biography, though sometimes diffuse and sometimes trite, is in the main a work of great merit, and very agreeable from the entire sympathy between the author - and the age he depicts and the subject of his biography. It has received much illustration from the notes of the Geι - man and Italian translators, Henke and Bossi, but requires to be re-edited with the aid of the numerous publications from archives which have taken place since Roscoe’s time. Audin's French life is a poor performance— partial, mainly borrowed from Roscoe, and disfigured by unsuccessful efforts after the picturesque. £R. G.)
