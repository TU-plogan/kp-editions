LIVERPOOL, Charles Jenkinson, first Earl of (1727-1808), was the eldest son of Colonel Jenkinson, Walcot, Oxfordshire, where be was born 16th May 1727. He was educated at Charterhouse school and at University College[9:14:718], Oxford, where after a career of special distinction he graduated M.A. in 1752. Almost immediately on entering parliament as member for Cockermouth in 1761, he was appointed under-secretary of state under Lord Bute, and, as he soon shared equally with that nobleman the favour of the king, his political advancement was rapid and uninterrupted while the friends of the king remained in office. By Grenville he was in 1763 appointed secretary of state; in the Grafton administration he, in 1766, obtained a seat at the Admiralty Board; and from 1778 till the close of Lord North’s ministry he was secretary at war. On the accession of Pitt to power in 1784, he became president of the Board of Trade, retaining office till Pitt’s resignation in 1801. Besides direct political power he also enjoyed a large share both of substantial and honoraιy political rewards. In 1773 he became member of the privy council, and obtained the vice-treasurership of Ireland, which he afterwards exchanged for the clerkship of the pells; and from 1786 to 1802 he was chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster. In 1786 he was created Baron Hawkesbury, and ten years afterwards earl of Liverpool. He died 17 th December 1808. Lord Liverpool was generally believed to be the chief political adviser of George III. His prudence, practical talents, and knowledge of the details both of home and foreign politics rendered him a specially safe and useful member of a cabinet.

He was the author of several political works, which display industry and discrimination, but, with the exception of his well-known Treatise on the Coins of the Realm, 1805, are without striking merits. His other writings are— National and Constitutional Force in England,, 1756; Treaties between Great Britain and other Powers, 1648-1783, 3 vols., 1785; The Conduct of Great Britain in respect to Neutral Nations, 1785, 3 vols., 1801.
