LE BEAU, Charles (1701-1778), a French historical writer, was born at Paris on October 15, 1701, and was educated at the Collège de Sainte-Barbe and the Collège du Plessis; at the latter he remained as a teacher after the termination of his course as a pupil, until he obtained the chair of rhetoric in the Collège des Grassins. In 1748 he was adπ itted a member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and in 1752 he was nominated professor of eloquence in the Collège de France. From 1755 he held the office of perpetual secretary to the Academy of Inscriptions, in which capacity he edited fifteen volumes (from the 25th to the 39th inclusive) of the Histoire of that institution. He died at Paris on March 13, 1778.

The only work with which the name of Le Beau continues to be associated is his Histoire du Bas-Empire, en commençant à Constantin le Grand, in 22 vols. 12mo (Paris, 1756-1779), being a continuation of Rollin’s Histoire Romaine and Crevier’s Histoire des Empereurs. Its usefulness arises entirely from the fact of its being a faithful résumé of the Byzantine historians, for Le Beau had no originality or artistic power of his own. Five volumes were added by Ameilhon (1781-1811), which brought the work down to the fall of Constantinople. A later edition, under the care of Saint-Martin and afterwards of Brosset, has had the benefit of careful revision throughout, and has received considerable additions from Oriental sources.
