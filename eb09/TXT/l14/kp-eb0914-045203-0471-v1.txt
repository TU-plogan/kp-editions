+=====================================================================+


LEO I., Flavius, surnamed Magnus and Thrax, emperor of the East, was born about 400 a.d., in the country of the Bessi, Thrace, and succeeded Marcian in February 457. At the time of his elevation he was an obscure military tribune, but had become steward to Aspar, patrician and commander of the guards, who might himself have aspired to the purple had he not been tainted with the Arian heresy. In recommending his servant to the soldiers, who proclaimed him emperor, Aspar hoped through him to be able to exercise the reality of power. The election of Leo was ratified by the senate; his coronation by Anatolius, the patriarch of Constantinople, is said to have been the earliest instance of such an ecclesiastical ceremony. The precise nature of the military success against thé barbarians which, according to the chronicles, the new emperor achieved in the first year of his reign is not accurately known. Of the more conspicuous incidents of his subsequent life, the first in chronological order is his intervention in the politico-religious troubles in Egypt, where the Eutychians had gained the upper hand, and, encouraged by the Arianizing Aspar, had made their own nominee, Timotheus Ailurus, patriarch of Alexandria. Leo made peace by deposing and banishing the new patriarch, and, when reminded by Aspar that it ill became a wearer of the purple to be guilty (as in this case he had been) of promise-breaking, retorted that it was equally unbecoming that a prince should be compelled to resign his own judgment and the public interest to the will of a subject. In 466 the Huns, invading Dacia, were defeated by Leo’s generals Anthemius and Anagastus, and again by the latter in 468. In 468 Leo, in concert with Anthemius, whom in the intervening year he had caused to be made emperor of the West, equipped a naval armament against the Vandals of Africa, who, under Genseric, had long been the scourge of Italy and the Mediterranean. The large fleet of more than one thousand vessels was intrusted to the command of Leo’s brother-in-law Basiliscus, who, after a prosperous passage, disembarked his troops safely at Cape Bona within 40 miles of Carthage, but weakly granted a truce of five days to the enemy; during the interval, favoured by the wind and the darkness of the night, the fleet of Genseric, with several fireships in tow, attacked the Roman vessels, burning and sinking one half of them, and thus causing the entire failure of the expedition. A widespread belief that the Arian Aspar had somehow helped to bring about this disastrous defeat furnished Leo with a pretext for getting rid of this dangerous kingmaker, who accordingly was treacherously put to death, along with one of his sons, in 471. To avenge (as they alleged) the murder, the Goths invaded Thrace, and ravaged the country almost to the walls of the capital. In October 473 Leo associated with himself his child grandson Leo II., and in the following year he died (February 3, 474); his successor survived him fora few months only. The somewhat misleading surname of Great borne by Leo I. is due solely to the obsequious gratitude of the orthodox party; by the Arians he was, not without some show of justice, nicknamed Macellarius (“butcher”).
