LOMONOSOFF, Mikhail Vasilievich (1711-1765), was born in the year 1711, in the village of Denisovka (which in later times has had its name changed in honour of the poet), situated on an island not far from Kholmogori, in the government of Archangel. His father, a fisherman, took the boy as soon as he was ten years of age to assist him in the labours of his calling; but his eagerness for knowledge was unbounded. The few books accessible to him he almost learned by heart; and, seeing that there was no chance of his stock of knowledge being enlarged under the arctic skies of his native place, he resolved to betake himself to Moscow in the best way he could. An opportunity occurred when he was seventeen years of age, and by the intervention of friends he obtained admission into the Zaikonospasski school. There his progress was very rapid, especially in Latin, and in 1734 he was sent from Moscow together with other promising students to St Petersburg. There again his proficiency, especially in physical science, was remarked by all, and he was one of the young Russians chosen to complete their education in foreign countries. He accordingly commenced the study of metallurgy at Marburg; but, not content with his work under the professors, he now began to write poetry, imitating German authors, among whom he is said to have especially admired Günther. His Ode on the Taking of Khotin from the Turks was composed in 1739, and attracted a great deal of attention at St Petersburg. During his residence in Germany Lomonésoff married a native of the country, and found it difficult to maintain his increasing family on the scanty allowance granted to him by the St Petersburg Academy, which, moreover, was irregularly sent. His circumstances became embarrassed, and he resolved to leave the country secretly, and to return home. On his arrival in Russia, after an adventure with a Prussian recruiting officer which at one time threatened serious consequences, he rapidly rose to distinction, and was made professor of chemistry in the university of St Petersburg; he ultimately became rector, and in 1764 secretary of state. He died in 1765.

The most valuable of the works of Lomonôsoff are those relating to physical science, and he wrote upon many branches of it. He everywhere shows himself a man of the most varied learning. He compiled a Russian grammar, which long enjoyed popularity, and did much to improve the rhythm of Russian verse. Many of his poems are good, but they do not constitute his chief claim to be remembered. The school upon which he formed himself as a poet was a bad one. We must remember that these were the days of falsely-conceived classicism, and the French taste upon which all the literature of Europe was moulded. His great merit is that he belongs to the glorious band of patriots, which includes such men among Slavs as Dositei Obradovich, Raich, and Primus Trüber,— men whose object was to elevate and give dignity to their country,— earnest toilers in the field of national education.
