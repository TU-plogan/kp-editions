LEON, the chief city of a department of the same name in the republic of Nicaragua, situated in an extensive plain about midway between the great inland lake of Nicaragua and the Pacific Ocean. It is connected by rail (1881) with Corin to on the coast (which has taken the place of Realejo, its former port); and the line is being extended to Leon Viejo on Lake Managua and thence to Granada. The city is spread over so wide an area that Squier, after a three monthsâ€™ residence, found himself discovering new and secluded portions. Its public buildings are among the finest of Central America. The cathedral (1746-1774) is a strong piece of masonry, with a roof of massive arches, which has several times been used as a fortress during the civil wars. The old episcopal palace (1678), the new episcopal palace (1873), and the college of St Ramon (1678) also deserve to be mentioned. The population is estimated at from 20,000 to 30,000. Contiguous to Leon, and practically one with it, is the Indian pueblo of Subtiaba, which has its own public buildings, and among the rest a church which almost rivals the cathedral.

At the time of the Spanish conquest Subtiaba was the residence of the great cacique of Nagrando, and the seat of au important temple. The city of Leon, founded by Hernandez de Cordova in 1523, was originally situated at the head of the western bay of Lake Managua, and was not removed to its present position till 1610. Thomas Gage, who visited it in 1665, describes it as a splendid city; and in 1685 it yielded rich booty to Dampier and his company. See Squier, Central America, vol. i.; and Scherzer, Free States of Central America.
