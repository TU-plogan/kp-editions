LONGOMONTANUS, or Longberg, Christian (1562-1647), a Danish astronomer, was born at Longberg, a village of Jutland, in Denmark, on the 4th of October 1562. Having, when only eight years old, the misfortune to lose his father, who was only a poor labourer, he was taken charge of by a maternal uncle, through whose influence he received lessons from the clergyman of the place. Although, owing to the poverty of his parents, the instruction which he had received up to this time had been of the most elementary kind, his aptitude for learning was so great that, under the tuition which he now received, he made rapid progress in his studies, especially in the mathematical sciences, for which he acquired an intense liking. His mother, however, was unable to pay any longer for his education, and he was reluctantly compelled to return home to work in the fields. By improving every opportunity which his laborious life now permitted, he was still enabled to pursue, to some extent, his favourite studies. This state of matters continued for some time; but his intense thirst for knowledge, and the uncalled-for jealousy of his friends, led him in 1577 to steal away from home, to try his fortune in the world. Accordingly, at the age of fifteen, he went to Wiborg, a town about 12 miles distant from his native village. There he spent eleven years, dividing his time between attending the lectures of the professors in the college of that town, and working in the fields. By this means he was able not only to earn a sufficient livelihood, but also to defray the expenses of his education; and his close application to study soon enabled him to acquire considerable knowledge of literature and of the sciences. In 1588, at the age of twenty-six, he removed to Copenhagen, where his great abilities speedily secured for him the esteem and admiration of the professors in the university of that town. By this means he was brought under the notice of the eminent astronomer Tycho Brahe, who received him very kindly, and ultimately appointed him his assistant He remained with Tycho Brahe for eight years in the island of Hoene, and during that time rendered him such valuable services in his astronomical observations and calculations, that, when Tycho Brahe settled in Germany, he invited Longomontanus to accompany him. This offer he accepted; but having shortly afterwards expressed to Tycho Brahe his desire to return to his native country, the latter at once furnished him, not only with excellent testimonials, but also with money for his journey. On his return to Denmark he made a long detour in order to visit the places whence Copernicus [9:14:867] had made his celebrated astronomical observations. On his arrival at Copenhagen, he found a patron in the person of Christian Friis, chancellor of Denmark, who gave him employment in his household. He continued in this situation till 1603, when he received the appointment of rector of the college of Wiborg. Two years later (1605) he was elected to the chair of mathematics in the university of Copenhagen. This appointment he held till his death, on the 8th of October 1647. Longomontanus, although one of the best astronomers of his age, inherited some of its worst prejudices. A firm believer in astrology, he held, among other things, that comets were messengers of evil. He also imagined that he had squared the circle. He found that the circle whose diameter is 43 has for its circumference the square root of 18252,—which gives 344185 for the value of τr. Pell and others endeavoured to prove that he was mistaken, but they failed to convince him of his error. He refers to his imagined discovery in almost all his published works, and defends his position with great zeal.
