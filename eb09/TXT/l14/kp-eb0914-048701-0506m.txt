LEVIS, formerly Pointe Levi or Point Levis, the chief town of a county of the same name in Canada, on the other side of the St Lawrence from Quebec, with which it communicates by a ferry. In the beginning of the present century Pointe Levi was a cluster of white houses, with a church and a number of large mills; it has now become an important station on the Grand Trunk Railway, and in the extent of its river trade is surpassed by only a few places in the Dominion. In 1881 the population was 7597.
