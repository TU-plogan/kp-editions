LANCRES, a town in the department of Haute-Marne, France, 186 miles south-east from Paris, stands at a height of some 1550 feet, upon a jutting promontory of the tableland to which it gives its name (Plateau de Langres), and overlooks, eastward and westward respectively, the valleys of the Marne and its tributary the Bonnelle. Its situation involves a rigorous climate, but also gives it strategic importance. The citadel stands to the south of the town, where it joins the table-land. From the ramparts and the cathedral tower there is an extensive view over the valley of the Marne, the Vosges, and the Cote d’Or; and in clear weather Mont Blanc (160 miles distant) is visible. Several detached forts and numerous batteries make Langres one of the strongest fortified camps of the country. The cathedral, the choir and nave of which date from the 12th and 13th centuries, possesses some fine features, but has been debased by a front in the style of the 17th century. The church of St Martin possesses a Christ, which is one of the finest wood-carvings known. The Gallo-Roman gate, one of four entrances to the town in the time of the Romans, is conjectured to have been intended as a triumphal arch to some victorious emperor, perhaps Marcus Aurelius. The gate “des moulins” is now the most noteworthy in the town. Langres possesses an antiquarian museum and a rather important library, as well as a picture gallery. The cutlery which bears the name of Langres is manufactured in the neighbourhood. Population, 10,375.

The town takes its name from the Lingones, who occupied it in the time of Caesar. Under the Capets its bishop was an ecclesiastical peer of the kingdom, and held the sceptre at royal coronations.
