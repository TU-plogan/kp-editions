LÉRIDA, one of the forty-nine provinces of Spain, is bounded on the N. by France (and the “republic” of Andorra), on the Έ. by Gerona and Barcelona, on the S. by Tarragona, and on the W. by Saragossa and Huesca, and has an area of 4772 square miles, with a population (in 1877) of 285,297. It is almost entirely mountainous, and partakes of the features common to the whole southern slope of the Pyrenees. The principal river is the Segre, a tributary of the Ebro. The province has five cities, Lérida, Balaguer (Bergusia), Cervera, Seo de Urgel, and Solsona, but only the first-mentioned of these has a population exceeding 5000; the next largest (Balaguer) in 1877 had only 4742. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in pastoral occupations.

Lérida, the capital of the above province, and in point of numbers and prosperity the second city in Catalonia, is situated on the right bank of the Segre, crossed there by a handsome stone bridge. The distances by rail from Saragossa and Barcelona respectively are 114 and 113 miles. The old cathedral, on the top of an eminence overlooking the town, was begun in 1203 and consecrated in 1278; it is a Gothic building of merit in some respects, but is rapidly going to decay, having never been used for religious purposes since 1707. The actual cathedral is a Graeco-Roman structure dating only from 1749. The town has no other feature of interest. There are manufactures of glass, leather, paper, and of woollen and cotton goods, and a considerable trade in the timber brought down from the Pyrenees by the Segre. Population in 1877, 20,369.

Lérida is the Ilerda of the Bomans, and was the capital of the people whom they called Ilerdenses (Pliny) or Ilergetes (Ptolemy). By situation the key of Catalonia and Aragon, it was from a very early period an important military station. In the Punic wars it sided with the Carthaginians and suffered much from the Boman arms. In its immediate neighbourhood Hanno was defeated by Scipio in 216 b.c., and it afterwards became famous as the scene of Caesar’s arduous struggle with Pompey’s generals Afranius and Petreius in the first year of the civil war (49 b.c.). It was already a municipium in the time of Augustus, and enjoyed great prosperity under later emperors. Under· the Goths it became an episcopal see, and at least one ecclesiastical council is recorded to have met there (in 546). Under the Saracens Lareda became one of the principal cities of the province of Saragossa; it became tributary to the Franks in 793, but was reconquered in 797. In 1149 it fell into the hands of Don Bamon Berenguer IV., last count of Barcelona. In modern times it has come through numerous sieges, having been [9:14:471] taken by the French in November 1707 during the war of succession, and again in 1810. In 1300 Jaime II. of Aragon founded a university at Lérida, which achieved some repute in its day, but is now extinct. Pope Calixtus III. at one time taught within its walls, and Vicente Ferrer was one of its alumni.
