LEWIS, Matthew Gregory (1775 -1818),often referred to as “Monk” Lewis, was born in London on July 9, 1775. He was educated for a diplomatic career at Westminster School and at Christ Church, Oxford, spending most of his vacations abroad in the study of modern languages; and in 1794 he proceeded to the Hague as attaché to the British embassy. His stay there lasted only a few months, but was marked by the composition, in ten weeks, of Ambrosio, or the Monk, which was published in the summer of the following year. It immediately achieved extensive celebrity; but some passages it contained were of such a nature that about a year after its appearance an injunction to restrain its sale was moved for and a rule nisi obtained. Lewis published a second edition from which he had expunged, as he thought, all the objectionable passages, but the work still remains of such a character as almost to justify the severe language in which the author of English Bards and Scotch Reviewers addresses—

“Wonder-working Lewis, Monk or Bard,

Who fain would’st make Parnassus a churchyard; Even Satan’s self with thee might dread to dwell, And in thy skull discern a deeper hell.”

Whatever its demerits, ethical or aesthetic, may have been, The Monk did not interfere with the reception of Lewis into the best English society; he was favourably noticed at court, and almost as soon as he came of age he obtained a seat in the House of Commons as member for Hindon, Wilts. After some years, however, during which he never ventured to address the House, he finally withdrew from a parliamentary career. His tastes lay wholly in the direction of literature, and The Castle Spectre (1796, a musical drama of no great literary merit, but which enjoyed a long popularity on the stage), The Minister (a translation from Schiller’s Kabale u. Liebe), Rolla (1797, a translation from Kotzebue), with numerous other operatic and tragic pieces, appeared in rapid succession. The Bravo of Venice, a romance translated from the German, was [9:14:494] published in 1804, and has since been reprinted; next to The Monkù is the work connected with the name of Lewis which has been most extensively read. By the death of his father he succeeded to a large fortune, and in 1815 embarked for the West Indies to visit his estates; in the course of this tour, which lasted four months, the Journal of a West Indian Proprietor, published posthumously in 1833, was written. A second visit to Jamaica was undertaken in 1817, in order that he might become further acquainted with, and able to ameliorate, the condition of the slave population; but the fatigues to which he exposed himself in the tropical climate brought on a fever which terminated fatally on the homeward voyage, May 14,1818. The Life and Correspondence of JL G. Lewis, in two volumes, was published anonymously in 1839; compiled by friendly hands, it makes it sufficiently plain that, whatever may have been the errors of judgment and taste displayed in the writings of his precocious youth, he was nevertheless a man of more than ordinary discretion, good feeling, and generosity.
