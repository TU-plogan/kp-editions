LE CLERC, Jean (1657-1736), or Clericus, theologian and man of letters, was born March 19, 1657 (o.s.), at Geneva, where his father Stephen Le Clerc was professor of Greek. The family had originally belonged to the neighbourhood of Beauvais in France, and several of its members have acquired some name in literature. On the completion of his grammar school course (in which he made himself remarkable for his omnivorous reading), he applied himself to the study of philosophy under Chouet the Cartesian, and from his nineteenth to his twenty-first year he attended the theological lectures of Mestrezat, Turretin, and Louis Tronchin. In 1678-79 he spent some time at Grenoble as tutor in a private family; on his return to Geneva he passed his examinations and received ordination. Soon afterwards he went to Saumur, where in 1679 were published Liberii de Sancto-Amore Epistolae Theologicae (Irenopoli: Typis Philalethianis), usually attributed to his pen; they deal with such subjects as the doctrine of the Trinity, the hypostatical union of the two natures in Jesus Christ, original sin, and the like, in a manner sufficiently far removed from that of the conventional orthodoxy of the period. From Geneva, which he still continued to regard as his home, Le Clerc in 1682 went to London, where he remained six months, preaching on alternate Sundays in the W alloon church and in the Savoy chapel. Passing over to Amsterdam he was introduced to Locke and Limborch; the acquaintance with the latter soon ripened into a close friendship, which naturally strengthened his preference for the Remonstrant theology, already favourably known to him by the writings of his granduncle Curcellaeus, and by those of Episcopius. A final attempt to live at Geneva, made at the request of his relatives there, satisfied him of the unwholesomeness of its stifling theological atmosphere, and in 1684 he finally settled at Amsterdam, first as a moderately successful preacher until ecclesiastical jealousy shut him out from that career, and afterwards as professor of philosophy, belles-lettres, and Hebrew in the Remonstrant seminary. This appointment, which he owed to his friend Limborch, he held from 1684 till 1712, when on the death of the latter he was called to occupy the chair of church history also. His suspected Socinianism was the cause, it is said, of his exclusion from the chair of dogmatic theology. Apart from its varied and immense literary labours, his life at Amsterdam was quite uneventful. His marriage to the daughter of Gregorio Leti took place in 1691. In 1728 and following years repeated strokes of paralysis gradually reduced him to a state of mental imbecility, from which he was released by death on January 8, 1736.

A full catalogue of the publications of Le Clerc will be found, along with adequate biographical material, in Haag’s France Protestante (where seventy-three works are enumerated), or in Chaufle-pié’s Dictionnaire. Only the most important of these can be mentioned here. In 1685 he published Scntimens de quelques théologiens de Hollande sur l' Histoire Critique du Vieux Testament composée par le P. Richard Simon, in which, while pointing out what he believed to be the faults of that author, he undertook to make some positive contributions towards a right understanding of the Bible. Among these last may be noted his argument against the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch, his views as to the manner in which the five books actually were composed, his opinions (singularly free for the time in which he lived) on the subject of inspiration in general, and particularly as to the inspiration of Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles. Simon’s Réponse (1686) elicited from Le Clerc a Défense des Scntimens in the same year, which was followed by a new Réponse (1687). In 1692 appeared his Logica sire Ars Ratiocinandi, and also Ontologia et Pneumatologia ; these, with the Physica (1695), are incorporated with the Opera Philosophica which have passed through several editions. In 1693 his series of Biblical commentaries began with that on Genesis; it was not completed until 1731. The portion relating to the New Testament books included the paraphrase and notes of Hammond. Le Clerc’s commentary had a great influence in breaking up traditional prejudices and opening men’s eyes to the necessity for a more scientific inquiry into the origin and meaning of the Biblical books. It was on all sides hotly attacked,—often for opinions which now seem innocent to the most orthodox. Le Clerc’s new edition of the Apostolic Fathers of Cotelerius, published in 1698, marked an advance in the critical study of these documents. But the greatest literary influence of Le Clerc was probably that which he exercised over his contemporaries by means of the serials, or, if one may so call them, reviews, of which he was editor. These were the Bibliothèque universelle et historique (Amsterdam, 25 vols. 12mo, 1686-93), begun along with De la Croze; the Bibliothèque choisie, Amsterdam,

28 vols. 18mo, 1703-13; and the Bibliothèque ancienne et moderne,

29 vols. 18mo, 1714-26. See Le Clerc’s Parrliasiana ou Pensées sur des matières de critique, d’histoire, de morale, et de politique: avec la défense de divers ouvrages de Μ. L. C. par Théodore Parrhase, Amsterdam, 1699; and Vita et opera ad annum MDCCXI., amici ejus opusculum, philosophicis Clerici operibus subjiciendum, also attributed to himself. The supplement to Hammond’s notes was translated into English in 1699, Parrliasiana, or Thoughts on Several Subjects, in 1700, and the Harmony of the Gospels in 1701. Twelve Dissertations out of Μ. Le Clercs Genesis appeared in 1696.
