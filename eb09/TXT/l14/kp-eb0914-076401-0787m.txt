LOCKPORT, capital of Niagara county, New York, about 21 miles east of Niagara Falls, at the point where the New York Central Railroad crosses the Erie canal. It takes its name from the locks (ten in number) by which the canal is lowered 66 feet from the level of Lake Erie to that of the Genesee river; and its prosperity as a Ï‚ manufacturing centre is due to the water-power. The surrounding country is a rich agricultural district, and in the vicinity are extensive limestone and sandstone quarries. Flour-mills are prominent among the industrial establishments; there are also numerous saw-mills, cotton and woollen factories, foundries, &c. Lockport was made a city in 1865. The population in 1870 was 12,426; in 1880, 13,522. The buildings in the business part of the city are generally heated by steam on the Holly distributing system, which originated in Lockport, as did the celebrated Holly water-works system.
