LEON, Luis Ponce de (1528-1591), usually known as Fray Luis de Leon, Spanish religious writer, was born about 1528, most probably at Granada, entered the university of Salamanca, where Melchior Cano was a few years his senior, at the age of fourteen, and in 1544 became a member of the Augustinian community there. His academical promotion was comparatively rapid; in 1561 he obtained by public competition a theological chair at Salamanca, to which in 1571 was added that of sacred literature. His views in exegesis and Biblical criticism were so far in advance of those of the majority of his immediate contemporaries that he was denounced to the Inquisition for having written a too secular translation of the book of Canticles, and for maintaining the possibility of correcting the text of the Vulgate. In March 1572 he was consequently thrown into prison at Valladolid, where his confinement lasted until December 1576; the charges against him were then abandoned, and he was released with an exhortation to circumspection, moderation, and prudence. He at once resumed his former posts at Salamanca, and the remainder of his days were passed in comparative peace. In 1580 a Latin commentary on Canticles was published, and in 1583-85 he gave to the world three books of a treatise on the names of Christ, which he had written in prison. In 1583 also appeared the most popular of his prose works, a treatise entitled La Perfecta Casada (“The Perfect Wife”) for the use of a lady newly married. Shortly before his death, which occurred at Madrigal on August 23, 1591, his appointment to be vicar-general of the Augustinian order was sanctioned by the pope.

It is chiefly as a poet that Fray Luis de Leon is now remembered and admitted to a high place among the classic authors of Spain. His poetical works include historical translations of all the Eclogues and two of the Georgies of Virgil, some thirty odes of Horace, forty psalms, and passages from the Greek and Italian, all characterized by much spirit and grace of style. The original pieces, which are chiefly religious, not merely possess the technical merits of idiom and versification which perhaps only Castilian ears can appreciate, but in many cases give beautiful expression to feelings which are shared by the whole of the Christian world. Of one in particular, the ode “De la Vida del Cielo,” Hallam has justly remarked that it is “an exquisite piece of lyric poetry, which in its peculiar line of devout aspiration has perhaps never been excelled.” The works of Luis de Leon include a Spanish commentary on Canticles, which was not published until 1798; a translation, in Spanish octaves, of the same book, first printed in 1806; and an exposition of Job, which first appeared in 1779.

The first collective edition of Obrαs proprias y traducciones was published by Quevedo at Madrid in 1631; another, fuller and more carefully edited, appeared at Valencia in 1761; the latest and best is that of Merino (Obras reconocidas y cotejadas con varios manuscrites, 6 vols., Madrid, 1804-16). His original poems, with a German translation, by Schliiter and Storck, appeared at Münster in 1853. There are two recent German monographs on Luis de Leon (Wilkens, Fray Luis de Leon, Halle, 1866; and Reusch, Luis de Leon u. die Spanische Inquisition, 1873), and one in Spanish (José Gonzales de Tejada, Vida de Fray Luis de Leon, Madrid, 1863).
