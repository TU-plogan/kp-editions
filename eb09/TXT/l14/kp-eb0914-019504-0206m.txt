LACTANTIUS FIRMIANUS, also called Lucius Caecilius or Lucius Caelius Lactantius Firmianus, was a Christian writer who from the beauty of his style has been called the “Christian Cicero.” His history is very obscure. His very name is doubtful; his birthplace, whether in Italy or in Africa, is uncertain; it is impossible to say with any accuracy when his writings were published; and the date of his death is unknown. His parents were heathens; he was a pupil of Arnobius in Sicca in Africa; he went to Nicomedia in Bithynia while Diocletian was emperor to teach rhetoric, but found little work to do in that Greekspeaking city; he became a convert to Christianity, probably late in life; and about ten or twelve years before his death (312-318) he went to Gaul on the invitation of Constantine the Great, and became tutor to his eldest son Crispus. These facts, with his writings, are all that is known about Lactantius. His chief work Divinarum Institutionum Libri Septem is a long introduction to Christianity, written in exquisite Latin, but displaying such ignorance as to have incurred the charge of favouring the Arian and Manichaean heresies. The date of publication has been variously given from 302 to 323 a.d. One sentence seems to say that a persecution, which can scarcely be any other than the Diocletian, was raging while the book was being written (v. 17, 5); whilst in the first, second, fourth, and fifths books Constantine is addressed as emperor. Those who assert the earlier date of publication point out that the references to Constantine are omitted in several MSS. Others adopt the conjecture of Baluze that an early edition was published in Nicomedia and a later twenty years afterwards (cf. Ebert, üeber den Verfasser des Buches De Mort. Persecut., p. 129 sq.). The seven books [9:14:196] of the institutions have separate titles given to them either by the author or by a later editor. The first, De Falsa Religione, and the second, De Origine Erroris, attack the polytheism of heathendom, show the unity of the God of creation and providence, and try to explain how men have wandered from truth into polytheistic error. The third book, De Falsa Sapientia, describes and criticizes the various systems of prevalent philosophy, showing how baseless and contradictory they are. The fourth book, De Vera Sapientia et Religione, insists upon the inseparable union of true wisdom and true religion, and maintains that this union is made real in the person of Christ. The fifth book, De Justitia, maintains that true righteousness is not to be found apart from Christianity, and that it springs from piety which consists in the knowledge of God. The sixth book, De Vero Cultu, describes the true worεhip of God, which is righteousness, and consists chiefly in the exercise of Christian love towards God and man. The seventh book, De Vita Beata, discusses, among a variety of subjects, the chief good, immortality, the second advent, and the resurrection. Jerome tells us that Lactantius wrote an epitome of these Institutions, and such a work was discovered in the royal library at Turin in 1712 by C. M. Pfaff; it is doubtful, however, whether this MS. is the epitome of Lactantius. Besides the Institutions, Lactantius wrote a treatise, De Ira Dei, addressed to one Donatus and directed against the Epicurean philosophy; an argument for the wisdom and goodness of God as exhibited in the creation and preservation of the world, De Opificio Dei sive de Formatione Hominis ; and a very celebrated treatise De Mortibus Persecutorum, which describes God’s judgments on the persecutors of his church from Nero to Diocletian, and has served as a model for numberless subsequent writings of a like nature. De Mort. Persecut. is not included in the earlier editions of Lactantius; it was discovered and printed by Baluze in 1679. Many critics do not believe it to be the work of our author, and ascribe it to an unknown Lucius Caecilius (see the work of Ebert above quoted). Jerome speaks of Lactantius as a poet, and several poems have been attributed to him :— De Phenice, Symposium, De Pascha ad Felicem Episcopum, and De Passione Domini. It is extremely probable that all these are the productions of a much later age.

MSS. of Lactantius are very numerous; a very complete catalogue of these and of the earlier printed editions will be found in Le Brun and Lenglet Dufresnoy’s edition, 2 vols. Paris, 1748. The best editions besides Dufresnoy’s are those of Walch, Leipsic, 1715; of Biinemann, Leipsic, 1739; and in Migne’s Ραtrologiα Latina, vols. vi. and vii. A new edition is promised in the Vienna Corpus Script. Eccles. Latin.
