LEO III., Flavius, surnamed The Isaurian, a native of Isauria, born about 680, was originally called Conon, a name which he dropped after he had risen to military distinction. In 713 he received from Anastasius II. the command of the eastern army; and, when that emperor was deposed by Theodosius III. in 716, Leo, marching to Constantinople, compelled the usurper to resign, and was himself made emperor amid much popular enthusiasm, in March 718. The internal troubles of the empire had meanwhile permitted the advance of the Arabs, who in [9:14:453] large numbers invested the capital by land and sea in the following August; the siege was not raised until 720. Relieved from this pressing danger, and also in 721 from a conspiracy originating with the deposed emperor Anastasius II., Leo speedily inaugurated the aggressive religious policy with which his name is associated, by promulgating, in 722, the edicts commanding the baptism of Jews and Montanists throughout the empire, and in 726 that against the “idolatry of image worship,” which was destined ultimately to produce so important effects on the relations of Italy and the West with Byzantium. Instigated by Pope Gregory II., the Italians refused to obey the command to remove the pictures from their churches; and when Paulus, the newly-appointed exarch of Ravenna, sought to employ force, he was defeated and slain. A revolt which had broken out in the Cyclades and the Peloponnesus was with difficulty quelled, and an insurrection in Constantinople was only repressed after much bloodshed (730). In November 730 a council was held by Gregory II. at Rome, in which anathemas were pronounced against the destroyers of images, and therefore, by implication at least, against Leo. He retaliated by severing the Trans-Adriatic provinces from the Roman patriarchate, and by confiscating large possessions of the Roman see in Calabria and Sicily. Another council under Gregory HL, in 732, joined in a solemn excommunication of all iconoclasts, and image worship was set up in Rome on a more splendid scale than had previously been known. The emperor made a last effort to relieve his exarch Eutychius, shut up in Ravenna, and to bring the pope and Italy to obedience; but the great fleet which he sent was wrecked in the Adriatic, and with it the exarchate became practically lost to the empire. The closing years of Leo’s reign were disturbed by troubles with the Arabs; and 740 was made memorable by a great earthquake which devastated Constantinople, Thrace, and Bithynia. He died in 741.
