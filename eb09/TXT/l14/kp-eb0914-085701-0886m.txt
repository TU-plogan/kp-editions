LONG BRANCH, a fashionable seaside resort of the United States, in Ocean township, Monmouth county, New Jersey. The old village lies about a mile inland, but the watering-place proper is for the most part situated on the bluffs and plateau immediately above the beach. The bathing-grounds are excellent; there are fine drives along the beach in the vicinity; upwards of twenty thousand visitors can find accommodation in the hotels alone, of which there are no less than thirty-three; and there are besides hundreds of private residences occupied mainly by the wealthier classes from New York and Philadelphia. Since 1874 it can be reached directly from New York both by railway and by steamers. Long Branch has a corporation of seven commissioners. Its permanent population in 1880 was 3833, in 1882 about 5000.
