LEUTSCHAU (Hungarian, L'ocse ; Latin, Leutsovia; Slovakian, Levocza), capital of the Cis-Tisian county of Szepes, Hungary, and until 1876 a royal free town, lies in an elevated position surrounded by mountains, and near the railway from Kassa (Kaschau) to Oderberg, about 120 miles north-east from Budapest, in 49° Γ N. lat., 20° 35' E. long. Leutschau is the seat of the county administration, and of a royal court of law, and has many fine old buildings, of which the most interesting is the church of St James, a Gothic structure of the 13th century, with richly carved altar, several monuments, and a celebrated organ erected in 1623, and long reputed the largest in Hungary. The educational establishments comprise a royal upper gymnasium (founded 1520), a state upper real school (1868), a collegiate institute for girls, and a Minorite convent. The soil of the surrounding country is generally stony and sandy, and the climate from October to April severe, but the inhabitants nevertheless succeed in raising barley, wheat, oats, flax, and a large quantity of garden produce, especially beans and pease, which are considered the best in Hungary. Other sources of occupation are mining, foresting, horse, sheep, and cattle breeding, bee-keeping, and the preparation of wax, honey, and mead, for which last the town has long been noted. The number of beehives in 1881 was seven hundred. In December 1881 the population was 6900, mostly Germans and Slovaks by nationality, and Roman Catholics and Lutherans by creed.

Founded by Saxon colonists in 1245, Leutschau had by the early part of the 16th century attained a position of great relative importance. In 1599 a conflagration laid the greater part of the town in ashes, and during the 17th century it suffered repeatedly at the hands of the Transylvanian princes and leaders. In 1849, at the time, of the revolutionary war, nearly half the houses were destroyed by fire.
