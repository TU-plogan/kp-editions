LA NOUE, François de (1531-1591), surnamed Bras-de-Fer, one of the gallant Huguenot captains of the 16th century, was born near Nantes in 1531, of an honourable and ancient Breton family. His first exploit was the capture of Orleans at the head of only fifteen cavaliers in 1567, during the second Huguenot war. At the battles of Jarnac in March 1569 and of Moncontour in the following October, La Noue was taken prisoner; but he was exchanged on the latter occasion in time to resume the governorship of Poitou, and inflict a signal defeat on the royalist troops before Rochefort. At the siege of Fontenay (1570) his left arm was shattered by a bullet; and the iron limb that replaced it won him from his soldiers the sobriquet of IronArm. When peace was made in France in the same year, La Noue carried his sword against the Spaniards in the Netherlands, but was taken at the recapture of Mons by the Spanish in 1572. Permitted to return to France, he was commissioned by Charles IX. to attempt to reconcile the inhabitants of La Rochelle, the great stronghold of the Huguenots, to the king. But the Rochellois were too much alarmed by the recent massacre of St Bartholomew to come to any terms; and La Noue, perceiving that war was imminent, and knowing that his post was on the Huguenot side, gave up his royal commission, and from 1574 till 1578 acted as general of La Rochelle. When peace was again concluded, La Noue once more went to aid the Protestant estates of the Netherlands. Holding a high rank in their army, he took several towns and captured Count Egmont in 1580; but a few weeks afterwards he himself fell into the hands of the Spaniards. Thrust into a loathsome prison at Limburg, La Noue, the admiration of all, of whatever faith, for his gallantry, honour, and purity of character, was kept confined for five years by a powerful nation, whose reluctance to set him free is one of the sincerest tributes to his reputation. At length, in June 1585, La Noue was exchanged for Egmont and other prisoners of consideration, while a heavy ransom and a pledge not to bear arms against his Catholic majesty were also exacted from him. Till 1589 La Noue took no part in public matters, but in that year he joined Henry of Navarre and Henry III. against the Leaguers. He was present at both sieges of Paris, and at several of the chief battles; but at the siege of Lamballe in Brittany he received the wound of which he died some days later at Moncontour, August 4, 1591.

Bentivoglio exaggerates in saying that La Noue was as famous by his pen as by his sword. What writings he has left are of value enough, but it is not by them that he is remembered. He was the author of Discours Politiques et Militaires, 1587; Déclaration pour prise d’armes et la défense de Sedan et Jamets, 1588; Observations sur l'Histoire de Guicciardini, 2 vols., 1592; and notes on Plutarch’s Lives, which have not been published. His Correspondance was published in 1854. See La Vie de François, seigneur de La Noue, by Moyse Amirault, Leyden, 1661; Brantôme’s Vies des Capitaines Français; C. Vincen’s Les Héros de la Réforme: Fr. de La Noue (1875); and Haag, La France Protestante.
