LIVERPOOL, Robert Banks Jenkinson, second Earl of (1770-1828), son of the above by his first wife Amelia, daughter of Mr Watts, governor of Bengal, was born June 7,1770. He was educated at Charterhouse and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he had Canning, afterwards his close political associate, for a contemporary. In 1791 he entered parliament as member for Rye, but he first held office in 1801 as foreign secretary in Addingtonâ€™s administration, when he conducted the negotiations for the abortive treaty of Amiens. On the accession of Pitt to power in 1804, he obtained the home office, and till his elevation to the House of Peers he acted as leader of the party in the House of Commons. He declined the premiership on the death of Pitt in 1806, and remained out of office till the accession of Perceval in 1809, when he again became home secretary. After the assassination of Perceval in 1812 he became prime minister, and retained office till compelled in February 1827 to resign by the illness (paralysis) which terminated his life, 4th December 1828. The political career of Lord Liverpool was entirely of a negative character so far as legislation was concerned; the only principle which regulated his statesmanship was persistent opposition to every kind of change, especially in the direction of increased religious or political liberty. From the beginning he strongly resisted Catholic emancipation, and he was also prominent in delaying the emancipation of the slaves. The energy of Castlereagh and Canning secured the outward success of the foreign policy of the cabinet, but in his home policy he was always unfortunate and retrograde. The Pains and Penalties Bill against Queen Caroline greatly increased his unpopularity, first originated by the severe measures of repression employed to quell the general distress, which had been created by undue taxation and was aggravated by blind adherence to protection. Though, therefore, actuated throughout by an honesty beyond all question, and though always commanding the sincere respect of his opponents by his dignified and considerate bearing, Lord Liverpool was destitute of wide and genial sympathies, and of true political insight, and his resignation of office was followed almost immediately by the complete and permanent reversal of his domestic policy.
