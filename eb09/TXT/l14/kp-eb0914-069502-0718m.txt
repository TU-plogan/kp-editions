LISTON, John (1776-1846), comedian, was the son of a watchmaker in Soho, London, where he was born in 1776. While the teacher of a day school near Leicester Square, he began to take part in private theatricals, and soon conceived a passion for the stage. He made his d√©but at a small theatre in the Strand, and shortly afterwards obtained an engagement at Dublin theatre, where, although he adopted tragedy as his role, his natural talent for acting attracted the attention of Stephen Kemble, who engaged him for his theatre at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Discovering accidentally that his forte was not tragedy but comedy, Liston displayed in his personation of old men and country boys a fund of drollery and humour which proved irresistible. An introduction to Charles Kemble led to his appearance at the Haymarket in 1805 as Zekiel Homespun, and from this time he occupied an unrivalled position in his own line of performance, his broad humour being tempered by true artistic finish, while he possessed an original power of creation which, with his boundless faculty in the elaboration of absurdities, filled up meagre and commonplace outlines with the characteristics of vivid individuality. Paul Pry, first represented in 1825, and always his most popular part, soon became to many a real personage. Liston played successively at Covent Garden, Drury Lane, and the Olympic, and remained on the stage till almost the close of his life. He died March 22, 1846.
