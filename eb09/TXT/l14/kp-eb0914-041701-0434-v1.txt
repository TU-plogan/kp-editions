LEGION OF HONOUR, Order of the. This order of merit was instituted by Napoleon in 1802, all previously existing French military or religious orders—those of St Michael, the Holy Ghost, St Louis, and Military Merit, as well as the united orders of St Lazarus and Our Lady of Mount Carmel—having been abolished at the Revolution. All soldiers on whom sabres of honour had been already conferred were forthwith declared to be members, and all citizens of sufficient merit were declared to be eligible for admission, whatever their birth, rank, religion, or social position might be. At their reception they were required to swear upon their honour to employ all just, reasonable, and lawful means for the service of the republic, the maintenance of its territory, the support of the government, the law, and the public property, and to withstand every effort towards the restoration of the feudal system and its various accompaniments—in short, to co-operate as much as in them lay for the assertion of the principles of freedom and equality. The grand master was Napoleon himself; under him were 105 grand officers, 300 commanders, 450 officers, and 3665 chevaliers. To the members of the various classes yearly allowances, ranging from 5000 francs in the case of a grand officer to 200 in that of a chevalier, were assigned. Some unimportant modifications in details were made when the empire was introduced. Between 1805 and 1814 about 48,000 nominations were made, 1400 only being in favour of civilians. Shortly after the accession of Louis XVIII. considerable changes took place. The old military and religious orders were restored, and that of the Legion of Honour reduced to the last place; the king was of course its grand master; the membership was divided into five grades,—80 grand crosses, 160 grand officers, 400 commanders, 2000 officers, and an indeterminate number of chevaliers. These fixed numbers were to be exclusive of members of the royal family, princes of the blood, and foreigners. Admission (the reward of at least twenty-five years of distinguished service) in ordinary cases was to be made to the grade of chevalier only; and only chevaliers of more than four years’ standing, officers of two years’ standing, and commanders of three years were to be eligible for promotion. The admissions were in every case to be made on parade in the case of military persons, and at a public sitting of a court of first instance in the case of civilians. The terms of the oath required were, of course, somewhat modified, and the arrangements about yearly allowances could not be continued. After the revolution of July, the “Ordre royal de la légion d’honneur” again resumed the unique place and special character which had belonged to it under Bonaparte in 1802. But its constitution was again remodelled in 1852; the numbers of grand crosses, grand officers, commanders, and officers was fixed respectively at 80, 200, 1000, and 2000, the number of chevaliers being still left vague, while the system of annual allowances was restored. Since 1870 the maximum number of chevaliers has been fixed at 25,000, the remaining four classes having 70, 200, 1000, and 4000 assigned to them respectively. In each grade three-fifths must be military persons, the rest civilians. The yearly pension of a military chevalier is 250 francs, of an officer 500, of a commander 1000, of a grand officer 2000, and of a grand cross 3000. The order may be conferred upon foreigners, but these do not count. It has occasionally been conferred upon women (e.g., Rosa Bonheur). In connexion with the order there is an army medal, which may be distributed to the number of 40,000, and which entitles the bearer to a pension of 100 francs. On January 1, 1874, the military members of the legion, in point of fact, numbered 39,793, drawing 12,718,050 francs annually; and there were 51,460 holders of military medals, drawing 5,146,000 francs, besides not less than 15,000 civil members drawing no pension. By economy in making new appointments, these numbers have subsequently been reduced. Since 1805 there has existed an institution for the education of daughters, sisters, and nieces of members of the legion; in 1809 the numbers were fixed at 600, the place being the “Maison d’éducation de Saint Denis.” The arrangements have subsequently been considerably extended. The decoration under the first empire consisted of a white enamelled five-rayed star, bearing the portrait of Napoleon, and a wreath of oak and laurel, with the words “Napoleon, empereur des Français”; on the reverse was the French eagle grasping a thunderbolt, and the legend “Honneur et patrie.” The ribband was of watered scarlet silk. At present the obverse of the star bears the effigy of the republic and the words “République Française,” the reverse two tricolor flags with the original legend.
