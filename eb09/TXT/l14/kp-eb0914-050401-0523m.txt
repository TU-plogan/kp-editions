LIAU-YANG, or Leaou-Yang, a city of China, formerly the chief town of the province of Liau-tung or Shing-king (southern Manchuria), and still a place of considerable mark, 35 miles south of Moukden. It is situated in a rich cotton district, and carries on no small trade. The walls include an area about 2â…œ miles long by 2 miles broad, and there are pretty extensive suburbs; but a good deal even of the enclosed area is under cultivation. The population is estimated at 80,000.
