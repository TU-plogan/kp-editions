LOIRE-INFÉRIEURE, a maritime department of western France, is made up of a portion of Brittany on the right and of the district of Retz on the left of the Loire, and lies between 46° 45' and 47° 40' N. lat. and between 55' and 2° 32' W. long., being bounded on the W. by the ocean, on the N. by Morbihan and Ille-et-Vilaine, on the E. by Maine-et-Loire, and on the S. by Vendée. Its greatest length from east to west is 76 miles, its greatest breadth 65 miles, and its area 2654 square miles. The surface is very flat, and the highest point, in the north on the borders of Ille-et-Vilaine, is only 377 feet. The line of hillocks skirting the right bank of the Loire, and known as the “sillon de Bretagne,” nowhere attains a height of 265 feet; below Savenay they recede from the river, and the meadows give place to peat bogs. North of St Nazaire the Grande Brière, measuring 9 miles by 6, and rising scarcely 10 feet above the sea-level, still supplies old trees which can be used for joiner work; a few scattered villages occur on the more elevated spots, but communication is effected chiefly by means of the canals which intersect it. The district on the south of the Loire lies equally low; its most salient feature is the lake of Grandlieu, covering an area of 27 square miles, and surrounded by low and marshy ground, but so shallow (6 ’ 5 feet at most) that drainage would be comparatively easy. The Loire has a course of 68 miles within the department; its width above Nantes varies from 1300 to 3280 feet, and its volume at Nantes, where the tide begins to be felt, is never under 700 cubic metres per second. It has numerous islands. At Paimboeuf it is nearly 2 miles broad, but narrows again opposite St Nazaire before finally entering the ocean. The bed is not sufficiently regular to allow easily the passage of vessels drawing more than 10 feet of water. On the left bank a canal of 9 miles is about to be opened between Pellerin, where the dikes which protect the Loire valley from inundation terminate, and Paimboeuf. The principal towns on the river within the department are Ancenis, Nantes, and St Nazaire (one of the most important commercial ports of France) on the right, and Paimboeuf on the left. The chief affluents are on the right the Erdre and on the left the Sèvre, both debouching at Nantes. The Erdre has a succession of broad lakes which give it the appearance of a first class river; it forms part of the canal from Nantes to Brest The Sèvre, on the other hand, is hemmed in by picturesque hills; at the point where it enters the department it flows past the famous castle of Clisson. Apart from the Loire itself, the only navigable channel of importance within the department is the Nantes and Brest canal already referred to, fed by the Isac, a tributary of the Vilaine, which separates Loire-Inférieure from Ille-et-Vilaine and Morbihan. The climate partakes of the general Armorican character in respect of humidity, but is Girondine in its mildness. At Nantes the mean annual temperature is 54 o, 7 Fahr., and there are one hundred and twenty-two rainy days, the annual rainfall being 25 ’ 6 inches. Of the entire area nearly two-thirds is arable; one-seventh is occupied by meadows; and vineyards, woods, heath, lakes, pools, and marshes occupy the remainder.

The quantity of live stock is considerable:—320,000 horned cattle, 180,000 sheep, 80,000 pigs, 38,000 horses, asses, and mules. Poultry also is reared, and there is a good deal of bee-keeping. Wheat, rye, buckwheat, oats, and potatoes are produced in great abundance; leguminous plants are also largely cultivated, especially near Nantes. Beetroot, hemp, and chestnuts represent, along with wine and cider, the chief remaining agricultural products. The woods are of oak in the interior and pine on the coast. The department has deposits of tin, lead, and iron, which are hardly wrought, if at all. North-west from Ancenis a little anthracite is obtained from a coal-bed which is a prolongation of that of Anjou. The salt marshes, about 6000 acres in all, occur for the most part between the mouth of the Vilaine and the Loire, and on the Bay of Bourgneuf. The salt manufacture, which as late as 1874 produced 43,475 tons, is now decaying. There are slate quarries in the north-east of the department, and the granite of the sea-coast and of the Loire up to Nantes is quarried for large blocks, while the limestone about Chateaubriant occupies numerous kilns. The industries of the department are well developed: steam-engines are built for Government at Indret, a few miles below Nantes; the forges of Basse-Indre are in good repute for the quality of their iron; and the production of the lead-smelting works at Couéron amounts to several millions of francs annually. There are also considerable foundries at Nantes, Chantenay, and St Nazaire, and shipbuilding yards at Nantes, St Nazaire, Paimboeuf, and Croisic. Among other industries may be mentioned the preparation of pickles and preserved meats at Nantes, the curing of sardines at Croisic and in the neighbouring communes, salt-refining, the great sugar refinery at Nantes, and the tobacco manufacture also there. Fishing is prosecuted along the entire coast. Nantes, formerly one of the most important of French ports, has now given way before St Nazaire, the trade of which in 1878 exceeded 1,500,000 tons. The principal imports are coal, colonial wares, wood, metals,, manure; the exports are wine, salt, preserved meats and pickles, flour, refined sugar, and butter. The department is divided into five arrondissements—Nantes, Ancenis, Chateaubriant, Paimboeuf, and St Nazaire; Nantes is the capital. The population in 1876’ was 612,972, an increase of 243,667 since 1801.
