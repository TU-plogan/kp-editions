+====================================================================+


LANGUET, Hubert (1518-1581), diplomatist, and one of the boldest political writers of the 16th century, was born in 1518 at Viteaux, near Autun in Burgundy, where his father held a good official position. He early manifested an inclination for study, and his tastes were encouraged by able masters; at Poitiers he devoted himself not only to law but also to natural science, history, politics, and theology. On leaving that university, after a sojourn at Leipsic, where he became the friend of Camerarius, he visited Padua and Bologna, and saw many other parts of Italy. Having been introduced in the course of his Italian journey to the Loci Theologici of Melanchthon, he in 1549 set out for Wittenberg to make the acquaintance of that author, and thus originated a friendship which terminated only with the death of the latter in 1560. Between 1551 and 1557 Languet travelled extensively in Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Lapland, and in 1559 he entered the diplomatic service of the elector of Saxony, where he remained until his death. During the greater part of this period he was employed chiefly in negotiations with France and in the interest of the Huguenots. He was present in Paris on St Bartholomew’s Day (1572), and was the means of saving his friends Wechel the printer, and Duplessis-Mornay; but his efforts drew on him the attention of the mob, and he himself in turn became indebted for his life to the chancellor Morvilliers. From 1573 to 1576 his mission lay chiefly at the imperial court; here he gained the acquaintance and ultimately the close friendship of Sir Philip Sidney. About 1578 he went to Ghent on the invitation of John Casimir, whom he accompanied to England, and the rest of bis days he spent chiefly in the Low Countries, watching the course of political events. There seems to be no ground, however, for the assertion that in 1577 he had resigned his connexion with the court of Saxony, and formally attached himself to the prince of Orange. Languet died at Antwerp on September 30, 1581.

His correspondence with Augustus of Saxony (three hundred and twenty-nine letters, from November 17, 1565 to September 8, 1581) and with Mordeisen, the chancellor of the duchy (one hundred and eleven letters, from November1559 to the summer of 1565), were published by Ludovicus at Halle in 1699 under the title Arcana saeculi X VI. Huberti LanguctiEpistolae polrticae et historicae ad Philip. Syd-naeum (ninety-six letters, from April 22, 1573 to October 28, 1580) appeared at Frankfort in 1633, and have since been reprinted. Lan-gueti Epistolae ad Joach. Camerarium, patrem et filium (one hundred and eight letters) were published by L. Camerarius at Groningen in 1646. The Historica Descriptio of the siege and capture (1567) of Gotha appeared in 1568. The work by which Languet is best known is pseudonymous, and its authorship has not been undisputed. It is entitled Vindiciae contra tyrannos, sive de principis in populum populigue in principem legitima potestate, Stephane Junio Bruto Cella auctore, and bears to have been published at Edinburgh in 1579. By Edinburgh is most probably to be understood Basel. A French translation appeared in 1581; the original has been frequently reprinted, most recently at Leipsic in 1846. The work, which discusses with much freedom various points connected with the then familiar doctrine of passive obedience, attracted much attention, but its author was very successful in concealing the somewhat dangerous secret of his identity. It has been attributed to Beza, Hotman, Casaubon, and Duplessis-Mornay, by divers writers on various grounds—to the last-named on the very respectable authority of Grotius. The grounds on which Bayle (who has been followed almost unanimously by later writers) assigned it to Languet will be found in the form of a supplement to the Dictionnaire. The Apologie eu défence de Guillaume, Prince d’ Orange, contre le ban et [9:14:289] l'édit du roi d'Espagne (Antwerp, 1581) is sometimes attributed to Languet. There seems little doubt, however, that it was really the work of the prince himself, with the help eithçr of Pierre de Villiers (see Motley, Rise of Dutch Republic) or of Languet (Groen van Prinsterer, Archives).
