LENNEP, Jacob van (1802-1868), Dutch poet and novelist, was born March 24, 1802, at Amsterdam, where his father, David Jacob van Lennep, who also became known as a scholar and poet, was professor of eloquence and the classical languages in the Athenaeum. Lennep received his education partly in his native city and partly at Leyden, studying jurisprudence at the latter, and ultimately obtaining the degree of doctor of laws; he then settled as an advocate in Amsterdam. His first poetical efforts had been translations from Byron, of whom he was an ardent admirer, and in 1826 he published a collection of original Academic Idylls which had a modified success. He first attained genuine popularity by the Hederlandsche Legenden, which reproduced after the manner of Sir W. Scott, though without much psychological depth or literal accuracy, some of the more stirring incidents in the early history of his fatherland. His fame was further raised to a very high pitch by his comedies Het Dorp aan die Grenzen and Het Dorp over die Grenzen, which had reference to the political events of 1830. In 1829 he had broken ground in a new and hitherto untried field with the publication of De Pleegzoon (“The Adopted Son,” 1829), the first of a series of historical romances in prose, which have acquired for him in Holland a position somewhat analogous to that which Scott holds throughout the reading world. The series included De Roos van Dekama (1837), Onze Voorouders (1838), Ferdinand Huydk (1840), Elizabeth Musch (1850), and De Lotgevallen van Klaasje Zeνeηster (1866), several of which have been translated into German and French, and two (“The Rose of Dekama” and “The Adopted Son”) into English. In a closely connected department of literature, his Dutch history for young people (Geschiedenis van Noord-Nederlaηd aan mijne Kindern verhaaUl) is attractively written. Apart from the two comedies already mentioned, Lennep was the author of numerous dramatic pieces which have found much acceptance on the Dutch stage. For some years Lennep held a judicial appointment, and from 1853 to 1856 he was a member of the second chamber, in which he voted with the Conservative party. He died at Ooster-beek near Arnheim, on August 25, 1868. There is a collective edition of his Poetische Werken (13 vols., 1859- 1872), and also of his Romantische Werken (23 vols., 1855-1872).
