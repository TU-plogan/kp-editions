LESGHIANS, or Lesghis (from the Persian Lelcsi, called Leki by the Grusinians or Georgians, Armenians, and Ossetians), a number of tribes in the Caucasus forming [9:14:475] along with the Tchetchenians (about 165,000) the East Caucasus group, and spreading southward over the borders of Daghestan, the country which they have occupied from time immemorial, into the Transcaucasian circles Kuba, Shemakha, Nukha, and Sakataly. They are mentioned as Λτ)χαι by Strabo and Plutarch along with the Γi}λαι (perhaps the modern Galgai, a Tchetchenian tribe), and their name occurs with great frequency in the old chronicles of the Georgians, whose territory was exposed to their raids for centuries, until through the fall of Shamyl they were brought under subjection to Russia. Moses of Chorene mentions a battle in the reign of the Armenian King Baba (370-377 A.D.), in which Shagir, king of the Lekiaus, was slain. Among the Lesghians the chief place, both on account of numbers and importance, is due to the Avars (155,194) and the closely related Andians (35,511), to whom may be attached the Dido (9074) and a number of small tribes, confined to a few villages or even to one, and speaking different though intimately connected languages. The Avars, extending from the Sulak and the Kumyk steppe right through Daghestan to the Alasan in the Sakataly circle, were once the dominant people as their language is still the dominant language of all this district. Their neighbours the Kasimukhians (35,139), who call themselves Lakians, have a language of their own, and are well known as traders not only through all Transcaucasia but also in European Russia; beside them a small fragment of another race occupies the village Artchi (592 inhabitants) in a separate mountain valley. Towards the Caspian Sea the Lakians are bordered by the Darginians (88,045) and the Tabassaranians (16,350), who in the matter of dialect are strongly marked off from each other. To the north and south of the basin of the Samur (which consequently bears the native name Kulan-uaz or “middle river”) lives another of the leading tribes of Daghestan, the Kurinians or Lesghians par excellence, who by themselves alone occupy the circles of Kuri and Samur, as well as the greatest part of Kuba, and parts of Shemakha, Nukha, &c. Their language (investigated like other Caucasian tongues by Baron Uslar) is there spoken by 130,873 individuals; and closely related to it apparently are the languages of the neighbouring Aguliaus (5357), Rutulians (11,803), Zakhurians (4561). According to the specimens collected by Von Seidlitz in 1880 during a visit to their country, which lies round the snowy peak of the Shakh Dagh in the Kuba circle, the Djekians, Haputlians, and Krysians speak what seem to be dialects of Kurinian; but he cannot connect with any other tongue the language spoken by the peculiar-looking inhabitants of the neighbouring village of Khimlugh (2196). The Udinians (9668) are another Lesghian tribe, which, though at present it only occupies a few villages in the Nukha circle, was formerly widely distributed over the plain of the Kura, and may possibly be the wretched remnant of the Albanians, mentioned by Strabo and others as a people of similar importance with the Grusinians and Armenians.

All these Lesghians are more or less tall, good-looking and powerful, sometimes fair sometimes dark, bold, enduring, and intelligent—in one word, excellent material for the work of civilization as soon as their country is opened up by roads and the railway just projected from Vladikavkas by Petrovsk to Baku. Smith-work and cutlery are skilfully wrought among the Lesghians in general; the women weave excellent shawls (which vary in style according to locality); and the felt cloaks of Andi are known throughout the Caucasus.
