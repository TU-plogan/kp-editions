LAURVIK, or Laukvig, a seaport town of south-eastern Norway, in the amt of Jarlsberg, is situated at the head of a short fjord, near where the Lougen or Laagen Elv falls into the sea. A considerable trade in timber and fish is carried on; and formerly the best Norway iron was produced in the immediate neighbourhood, at Fritz√∂; but the works are now used as a saw-mill. About a mile to the south is Frederiksvaern, formerly a station of the Norwegian fleet, and the seat of a naval academy. The population of Laurvik in 1875 was 7681.
