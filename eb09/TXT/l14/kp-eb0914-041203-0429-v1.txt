LEGATE, one of the special names of a messenger or ambassador of the pope. The first four centuries present us with no actual recorded instances of recognized delegation of the papal authority; for that Hosius acted as papal legate at the council of Nice is nothing more than an [9:14:413] latere, and the title is now almost quite honorary. It still attaches to the sees of Seville, Toledo, Arles, Rheims, Lyons, Gran, Prague, Gnesen-Posen, Cologne, Salzburg, among others. The commission of the legαtus delegatus (generally a member of the local clergy) is of a limited nature, and relates only to some definite piece of work. The nuncius apostolicus (who has the privilege of red apparel, a white horse, and golden spurs) possesses ordinary jurisdiction within the province to which he has been sent, but his powers otherwise are restricted by the terms of his mandate. The legatus a latere (almost invariably a cardinal, though the power can be conferred on other prelates) is in the fullest sense the plenipotentiary representative of the pope, and possesses the high prerogative implied in the words of Gregory VII., “nostra vice quae corrigenda sunt corrigat, quae statuenda constituat.” He has the power of suspending all the bishops in bis province, and no judicial cases are reserved from his judgment. Without special mandate, however, he cannot depose bishops or unite or separate bishoprics. At present legati a latere are not sent by the holy see, but diplomatic relations, where they exist, are maintained by means of nuncios, internuncios, and other agents. According to the congress of Vienna, the diplomatic rank of a papal nuncio corresponds to that of an ambassador. The pope at present has nuncios at the courts of Bavaria, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Chili, Spain, France, and Portugal. Inferior in rank and less numerous are the internuncios (Holland, Brazil).
