LOGIC

1. LOGIC, in the most general acceptation of the term, may be regarded as the systematic study of thought. So wide a definition is certainly sufficient to comprehend all that may have been at various times included within the scope of logical doctrine, but in other respects it is of small value. It does not serve to mark off logic from philosophy as a whole, which is unquestionably the systematic exposition of thought, nor from psychology, which includes within its wider range what may well be described as the study of thought. Without some more accurate discrimination of the province and method of logic, neither the extent of matter to be included within the study nor the peculiarity of the method by which such matter is treated can be determined.

Preliminary queries of a similar kind are naturally encountered in the case of all other branches of human knowledge, and are generally answered by two methods. We may refer either to the distinct characteristics of the matter to be treated, or to the essential features of the method of treatment. We may determine the province of a science either by external division, by classification of objects according to their prevailing resemblances and differences, or by internal definition, by exposition of the fundamental characters of the method employed. By neither process, unfortunately, can an unambiguous answêr be supplied, at least without much art, in the case of logic.

2. The reasons for the manifold difficulties encountered in the attempt to determine accurately the province of logic, whether by reference to a division of the sciences or by precise definition of the essential features of logical analysis, are not far to seek. The systematic classification of the sciences involves not only consideration of the contents of the sciences as empirically presented, but also certain leading principles or fundamental views, which are in essence of a philosophical character. According to the general conception of knowledge which in various kinds is manifested in the special sciences, there will be radically divergent methods of classification, and the province assigned to each member of the ensemble will, for the most part, have its limits determined according to the character of the general view adopted. Moreover, if any of the more prominent specimens of classification of the sciences be critically inspected, they will be found to presuppose a certain body of principles, of scope wider than any of the special disciplines, and to which no place in the ensemble can be assigned. In short, a systematic distribution of human knowledge into its distinctly marked varieties rests upon and presupposes a general philosophy, the character of which affects the place and function of each part of the distribution. Logic, as may readily be imagined, has therefore experienced a variety of treatment at the hands of systematizers of scientific knowledge. It has appeared as one of the abstract sciences, in opposition to those disciplines in which the character of the concrete material is the essential fact; as a subordinate branch of a particular concrete science, the investigation of mental phenomena; as a nondescript receptacle for the formulation in generalized fashion of the method and logical precepts exemplified in the special sciences. By such processes no more has been effected than to bring into light, more or less clearly, some of the characteristics of the supposed science, without in any way supplying an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of its boundaries and relations to other branches of knowledge. Thus, when logic is marked off from . the concrete sciences and associated with mathematics in the most general sense, as the treatment of formal relations,^[1. As, e.g., by H. Spencer, Classification of the Sciences, pp. 6, 12; H. Grassmann, Die Ausdehnungslehre von 1844 (1878), Einleitung, xxii.-xxiii. ] and further differentiated from mathematics as implying no reference to the quantitative character of the most general relations under which facts of experience present themselves,^[2. Logic and mathematics, under this view, may be regarded either as generically distinct—which is apparently the opinion of Spencer, H. Grassmann, and Jevons—or as species of a more comprehensive genus, the theory of formal (symbolic) operations—which is apparently the opinion of R. Grassmann (see his Formenlehre, 1872) and Boole (see his Mathematical Analysis of Logic, 1847, p. 4, and Differential Equations, 1859, chap, xvi., specially pp. 388, 389). An admirable treatment of that which is implied in Boole’s method is given in Mr Venn’s Symbolic Logic, 1881. ] there is certainly brought to the front what one would willingly allow to be a commonplace respecting all logical analysis, namely, that its principles are coextensive with human knowledge, and that all objects as matters of conscious experience have an aspect in which they are susceptible of logical treatment. But no more is effected. It is still left to a wider consideration to determine what the specific aspect of things may be which shall be called the formal and be recognized as the peculiarly logical element in them. There may be selected for this purpose either the general relations of coincidence and succession in space and time, or the fundamental properties of identity and difference, or the existences of classes, but in any case such selection depends upon and refers to a theory of the nature of knowledge and of the constitution of things as known. In truth, the notions of form and formal relations are by no means so simple and free from ambiguity that by their aid one can at once solve a complicated problem of philosophic arrangement. To lay stress upon form as the special object of logical treatment still leaves undecided the nature and ground of the principles w hich are to be employed in evolving a science of form, and therefore leaves the logical problem untouched.

Still less satisfactory are the results when logic is regarded as in some way a subordinate branch of the psychological analysis of mental phenomena.^[3. For this extremely common arrangement, see Hamilton, Lectures on Metaphysics, i. p. 121-3; Ueberweg, System der Logik, § 6. ] Neither the grounds on which such a classification rests, nor the conclusions deduced from it, seem beyond criticism. The simple facts that certain mental processes are analysed in logic, and that psychology is generally the treatment of all mental processes, by no means necessitate the view that logic is therefore the outgrowth from and a subordinate part of psychology. For it is clear, on the one hand, that logic has a scope wider than psychology, since in any sense of the term it has to deal with all the processes (or with some aspect of all the processes) by which on any subject knowledge is formed out of disjointed or disconnected experiences. And, on the other hand, since the subordination of one science to another, as species to genus, is fallacious, unless the two agree in fundamental characteristics, the position so assigned to logic would imply that in aim and method it shall be essentially one with psychology, a position equivalent to the negation of logic as a separate and independent discipline. It is not surprising therefore to find that so soon as logic has been distinguished as arising from psychology, and so dependent on it, the peculiarity of its position and functions compels the recognition of its more general scope and the reduction of its connexion with psychology to an amount small enough to be compatible with absolute independence. Strong [9:14:781] reasons, indeed, may be advanced for holding that logic is entirely to be separated from psychology, as differing from it in aim, method, and principle, that logical analysis is generically distinct from psychological, and that the two disciplines, while connected as parts of the general body of philosophical reflexion, hold to one another a relation the reverse of that commonly accepted.^[4. It is to be acknowledged that most of the writers on logic who emphasize the connexion of psychology with logic introduce distinctions equivalent to the remarks above made, but the grounds for such distinctions and the conclusions to be deduced from them are not generally brought into clear light. ]

As to the endeavour to collect from consideration of the sciences in detail a body of precepts, the rules of scientific method, and to assign the systematic arrangement of such rules to one special discipline, called logic, it seems to stand on the same footing and to be open to the same criticism as the allied attempt to treat general philosophy as the receptacle for the most abstract propositions reached in scientific knowledge. There is a peculiar assumption underlying the supposed possibility of distinguishing between scientific method and its concrete exemplifications in the special sciences, and only on the ground of this assumption could there be rested the independence of logic as the systematic treatment of method. It is taken for granted, without examination, that the characteristic features of correct and well-founded thinking are palpable and general, and that we thus possess a criterion for marking off what is common to all scientific procedure from that which is special and peculiar to the individual sciences. An elaborate philosophic doctrine lies at the root of this assumption, and the position assigned to logic may easily be seen to depend, not on what is apparent in the argument, namely, comparison of the sciences with one another, but on what lies implicit in the background, the philosophic conception of the nature of scientific knowledge in general. Without reference to the ultimate philosophic view, no definite content could be assigned to logic, and it would remain impossible to distinguish logic from the sciences in detail·^[5. See, for a clear statement of this impossibility, Comte, Philos. Positive, i. 34, 35. Definitions of logic as theory of method, which are based on general philosophic views (e.g., the definition by Sigwart, Logik, i. § 1), stand on a different footing, and are to be examined on different principles. ]

3. Thus the various attempts to define the province and functions of logic from general classification of the sciences, to define, in short, by the method of division, yield no satisfactory answer, and refer ultimately to the philosophic view on which classification and division must be based. A similar result becomes apparent when we consider the various descriptions of logic that have been presented as following from more precise and accurate determination of the essential features of logical analysis and method.

“The philosophical deduction or construction of the notion of logic presupposes a comprehensive and well-grounded view, whether of the nature and mode of operation of the human mind, a definite part of which falls under logical treatment, or of the problems and objects of philosophy in general, from among which in due order may be distinguished the particular problem of logic.”^[6. Twesten, Die Logik, insbesondere die Analytik (1825), p. 2. ] The most elementary distinctions, by means of which, in the ordinary exposition of logic, progress is effected towards an accurate determination of the province of the science, not only refer to some such ultimate philosophic view, but lead to the most diverse results, according to the peculiarity of the views on which they are based. Of these elementary distinctions the following are at once the more usual and the more important :—the distinction between the province of logic and the province of the special sciences, as that between general and special; the distinction between natural growth of knowledge, with its natural laws, and the normal procedure whereby grounded knowledge is obtained, with its normal or regulative principles; the distinction between knowledge as a whole and its several parts, immediate and mediate, with restriction of logic to the treatment of all or portion of mediate knowledge; the distinction between the constituents of knowledge as on the one hand given from without (in experience), and on the other hand due to the elaborative action of intellect itself. To one or other of these may be traced the common definitions of logic, and a brief consideration of their contents will be sufficient to show that they severally rest upon more or less developed general philosophic doctrines, and that their significance for accurate determination of the field of logic depends not so much on what is explicitly stated in them as on what is implied in the general doctrines from which they have taken their rise.

The distinction of logic from the sciences, as dealing in the abstract with that which is concretely exemplified in each of them, is certainly a first step in the process of determination about which there can be little or no doubt. But if the distinction remain vague, it is not sufficient to differentiate logic from many other disciplines, philosophical or philological, and if it be made more precise, the new characteristics will be found to involve some special view as to what constitutes the common feature in the sciences, and to vary with the possible varieties of view. As a rule, too, the added characteristics do not serve by themselves to mark off logical treatment as an independent kind of investigation. They are most frequently obtained by a general survey of scientific procedure. Thus it may be said that in all sciences there are implied clearly defined notions, general statements or judgments, and methodical proofs; logic therefore, as the theory of the general element in science, will appear as the treatment of notions, judgments, and proofs generally, or in the abstract. If so, then, unless some implied principle further determine the course of procedure, logic would be regarded as a merely descriptive account of the parts making up scientific knowledge, and it would be not only impossible to assign to it an independent position, but hard to discriminate it from psychology, which likewise deals with the parts of knowledge. If it be understood, however, or explicitly stated, that in all scientific knowledge there is community of method, resting on common principles or laws of knowledge as such, then clearly not only the province of logic, as now made identical with the treatment of the essence of knowledge, but the special nature of the theorems making up the body of logic, must depend upon the general conception of knowledge with which the thinker starts. In the view of logic taken, e.g., by Mill, the fundamental idea is that of evidence, under which must be included all the grounds for any judgment not resting on immediate perception. So far as verbal statement is concerned, the adoption of this as the root idea would not distinguish in any special way the treatment of logical problems resting on it, but in fact each problem is dealt with in accordance with the particular theory of what, from the nature of human knowledge, constitutes evidence. Logic thus involves, or in truth becomes, a theory of knowledge, and in the end, for general spirit and details of doctrine, refers to an ultimate philosophic view. There seems no escape from this conclusion. Start as we may, with popular, current distinctions, no sooner do logical problems present themselves than it becomes apparent that, for adequate treatment of them, reference to the principles of ultimate philosophy is requisite, and logic, as the systematic handling of such problems, ceases to be an independent discipline, and becomes a subordinate special branch of general philosophy.

The attempt to avoid this conclusion must of necessity [9:14:782] take form in some discrimination of logic from other varieties which may with it be classed under philosophy in general, and such discrimination is usually effected by laying stress on one or other of the following characteristics.

(1) In the whole process of knowledge, it may be said, we are able to distinguish and to regard in isolation the methods according to which, from a combination of various elementsj cognition of things grows up, and the laws according to which these elements must be ordered, if our subjective consciousness is to represent accurately and faithfully the relations of things. The laws of knowledge, there being understood by knowledge the whole sum of mental determinations in and through which the world of external and internal experience is realized for us, are of two distinct kinds, natural and normal. For the treatment of the natural laws the most appropriate title is psychology; for that of the normal or regulative laws the title logic is peculiarly appropriate. By the one science knowledge is regarded in its relation to the subjective consciousness, as so much of what enters into and constitutes the world of inner experience; by the other knowledge is regarded in its relation to truth, to the objective system, as the means whereby, for theoretical or practical purposes, an orderly and verifiable conception of this system is realized. A definite place seems thus secured for logic, but, if one may judge merely from the various attempts to expound the body of logical doctrines from this point of view, the characteristic feature is not yet sufficient to determine the boundaries of the science or the specific nature of its problems. In fact, the feature selected might be accepted as the distinguishing mark of logical science by writers who would include under that common title the most diverse matters, and who would differ fundamentally in respect to the treatment of isolated problems. The metaphysical logic of Hegel, the empirical logic of Mill, the formal logic of Kant, might all claim to be developments of this one view of the essence of logic. So wide a divergence is clear evidence that the criterion selected, though possibly accurate, is not sufficiently specific, and that the interpretation of it, which in truth determines for each the nature and boundaries of the science, depends upon the view taken respecting knowledge as a whole in its relation to the objective order of experience, respecting the import of the so-called normal laws, and respecting the subjective elements supposed to constitute knowledge.

On all sides this particular definition of logic is beset with difficulties, which it cannot afford to dismiss by means of the simple demand that knowledge shall be accepted as somehow given. For, apart altogether from the danger that under so wide a term as knowledge many differences may be accommodated, it then becomes impossible to do more than treat in a quasi-empirical fashion mental facts, the nature and peculiarities of which are to be learned from some external source. In the later, more detailed examination of the view of logic here briefly described, it will be pointed out that the usual formula by which the several logical notions are introduced, viz., that their nature as mental facts is dealt with in psychology, from which logic borrows, is in fact much more than a formula. The logical peculiarities will be found to rest mainly upon the psychological characteristics as borrowed, while it is evident that no substantive, independent existence can be vindicated for a doctrine, the succession of whose parts, and their essential nature, are given externally.

(2) Some of the perplexities that arise when logic is treated as the theory of the normal laws of knowledge may be obviated by the current distinction between immediate and mediate knowledge. The normal laws of knowledge might be said to apply solely to the process of mediate cognition, and their final aim would be defined as harmony between mediate knowledge and immediate experience. But it is difficult to distinguish with perfect accuracy between the two kinds of knowledge in question; it is impossible that the treatment of the logical problem should not depend entirely on the view taken as to the nature of that which differentiates mediate from immediate knowledge. Whether we express this as thought or as belief, its nature then becomes the all-important factor in determining the course of logical treatment, and further progress will manifest divergencies according as stress is laid on the subjective characteristics of thought, the laws to which, from its essential nature, all its products must conform, or on the limitations imposed by principles which have reference to the most general relations of the things thought about. In the one case a formal logic, of the type commonly known as the Kantian, would be developed, in the other either an empirical logic, like that of Mill, wherein the nature of notions, propositions, and reasonings is considered from the point of view of the empirical conception of experience, or a transcendental logic, like that involved in the Critique of Pure Reason, or a metaphysical logic, like that of Hegel, or a mixed doctrine, like that of Trendelenburg, Lotze, and Ueberweg. In short, the general philosophic view of thought is that upon which the character of logic as a science rests.

(3) There has above appeared, incidentally, one of the most current methods of solving the logical problem, by procedure from the distinction between that which is given to the mind in knowledge, and that which is supplied by the mind itself. No distinction seems more simple; none is in reality more complex. The opposition on which, in its popular acceptation, it rests is that between the individual concrete thinking subject and the world of objective facts, existing, as it were, to be cognized. The full significance of such an opposition, the forms in which it presents itself in conscious experience, the qualifications which must be introduced into the statement of it that it may have even a semblance of reality,—these are problems not solved by a simple reference to the distinction as existing. It may well be held that knowledge is, for the individual, the mode (or one of the modes) in which his relation to the universe of fact is subjectively seized, but it is not therefore rendered possible to effect an accurate and mechanical separation of knowledge into its matter and form. Even on lower grounds it may be held that by the employment of this criterion little or no light is thrown upon the logical question. For no determination is supplied by it of the universal characteristic of form as opposed to matter in knowledge, and a comparison of various expositions will show the most startling diversity of view respecting the nature and boundaries of the formal element in knowledge. It is of course true that in one sense any scientific treatment of knowledge is formal. Our analysis extends only to the general or abstract aspect of cognition, not to its actual details. But we are not, on that account, dealing with the form of knowledge. So soon as it is attempted to define more accurately what shall be understood by form then it is found that various views of logic arise, corresponding to the variety of principles supposed to be applied in the treatment of form. Thus the stricter followers of the Kantian logical idea, e.g., Mansel and Spalding, recognize, as sole principles which can be said to be involved universally in thé action of thought, the laws of identity, non-contradiction, and excluded middle, and in their hands logic becomes merely the systematic statement of these laws, and the exposition of the conditions which they impose upon notions, judgments, and reasonings. Analytical consistency, i.e., absence of contradiction, is on this view the one aspect of knowledge which is susceptible of logical treatment. On the other hand, the idea of a contribution furnished by the [9:14:783] mind itself to knowledge may lead to a more concrete and yet not less exact system of the forms of knowledge, if there be taken into account the real character of the operation by which such contribution is made. Thus in the logic of Ulrici, from the view of thought as essentially the distinguishing faculty, by which definiteness is given to the elements entering into knowledge, there follows not simply an iteration of the principle that thought must not contradict itself, but a systematic evolution of the fundamental relations involved in the action of thought, in which the more specifically logical products, the notion, judgment, and reasoning, have a determinate place assigned to them.

Not only, then, may quite distinct provinces be assigned to logic by thinkers who start with the same idea of thought as contributing to knowledge, but, as may well be imagined, the treatment of special logical problems presents a most bewildering variety. The nature of judgment, the principle of reasoning, the characteristics of thought which is in accordance with logical rule, will be viewed differently according to the special interpretation put upon the functions of the subjective factor in knowledge. Here again we find that the really influential fact in the determination of the province and method of logical science is a general philosophic conception of knowledge or thought.^[7. In Rosenkranz, Die Modificαtionen der Logik abgeleitet aus dem Begriff des Denkens (1846), a similar conclusion is illustrated by an elaborate classification of possible modifications of the view of logic. Compare also Braniss, Die Logik in ihrem Verhältniss zur Philosophie geschichtlich betrachtet (1823). ]

4. There remains yet one method by which a clear and sufficient definition of the province and function of logic may be attainable. It may be that the separation of logic from other philosophic disciplines has come about historically, and that the assignment to logic of a special body of problems and a special kind of treatment is due to the accidents of its development. We might therefore hope to gain from a comparative survey of the field of logic, as that has been historically marked out, some definite view not only respecting the specific problems of logical theory, but also regarding the grounds for the isolated treatment of them. That in the history of logic there should be found a certain continuity of doctrine and development may, however, be compatible with entire absence of a common body of received logical matter, and the result of an historical research may be little more than a statement of distinct conceptions regarding the nature and province of the science, leading to the inclusion of very distinct materials within its scope. It requires but a superficial investigation of that which at various intervals has presented itself as logical theory to arrive at the conclusion that the differences in general spirit and in the mass of details far outbalance any agreement as to a few detaehed doctrines and technical symbols. If the survey were limited even to the period preceding the attempts at radical reformation of philosophy in general, and of logic as included therein, to the period in which the Aristotelian doctrines, as they may be called, formed the common basis of logical treatment, we should be able to detect differences of such a kind as to indicate radically distinct fundamental views. The scholastic logic, which, even by itself, cannot be regarded as one theory with unimportant modifications, is most falsely described as Aristotelian. The technical terminology, the general idea and plan, and some of the formal details are certainly due to the Aristotelian analysis of reasoned knowledge, but in spirit, in ruling principles, and in the mass of details the method of the scholastic logic is alien to that of Aristotle. It will be shown later that the Aristotelian analysis is saturated with the notions and aims of the Aristotelian metaphysics and general theory of knowledge, and that on this account alone, apart from the introduction of many foreign ingredients, from Stoic, Arab, and Byzantine sources, into the scholastic system, an important difference must subsist between the original doctrine and that which presents itself as but its historical development. Even more radical is the divergence of modern logic from the Aristotelian ideal and method. The thinker who claimed for logic a special pre-eminence among sciences because “since Aristotle it has not had to retrace a single step, and to the present day has not been able to make one step in advance,”^[8. Kant, Kritik, Vorrede, p. 13. ] has himself, in his general modification of all philosophy, placed logic on so new a basis that the only point of connexion retained by it in his system with the Aristotelian may be not unfairly described as the community of subject. Both deal in some way with the principles and methods of human thinking, but as their general views of the constitution of thought are diverse, little agreement is to be found in the special treatment of its logical aspect. So when a later writer prefaces his examination of logical principles with the declaration that “logic is common ground on which the partisans of Hartley and of Reid, of Locke and of Kant, may meet and join hands,”^[9. Mill, System of Logic, i. p. 13. ] we are not unprepared for the result that, with a few unimportant exceptions, his views of logical principle coincide with those of no recognized predecessor in the same field, diverge widely from either the currently received or the genuine Aristotelian doctrines, and lead to a totally new distribution, in mass and detail, of the body of logical theorems and discussions. Such divergence is, indeed, most intelligible. If one reflects on the significance which would be attached in any one of these logical systems, of Aristotle, of Kant, of Mill, to the universal or universalizing element of thought, and on the fact that such universal must manifest itself as the characteristic feature in all the important products of thinking, the notion, the judgment, the syllogism, the conclusion is inevitable that difference of view in respect to the essence must make itself felt in difference of treatment of details. The ultimate aim of proof, and the general nature of the methods of proof, must appear differently according as the accepted ground is the Aristotelian conception of nature and thought, the Kantian theory of cognition, or subjective empiricism.

If, adopting a simpler method, one were to inspect a fair proportion of the more extensive recent works on logic, the conclusion drawn would be probably the same,—that, while the matters treated show a slight similarity, no more than would naturally result from the fact that thought is the subject analysed, the diversity in mode of treatment is so great that it would be impossible to select by comparison and criticism a certain body of theorems and methods, and assign to them the title of logic. That such works as those of Trendelenburg, Ueberweg, Ulrici, Lotze, Sigwart, Wundt, Bergmann, Schuppe, De Morgan, Boole, Jevons, and these are but a selection from the most recent, treat of notions, judgments, and methods of reasoning, gives to them indeed a certain common character; but what other feature do they possess in common? In tone, in method, in aim, in fundamental principles, in extent of field, they diverge so widely as to appear, not so many different expositions of the same science, but so many different sciences. In short, looking to the chaotic state of logical text-books at the present time, one would be inclined to say that there does not exist anywhere a recognized, currently received body of speculations to which the title logic can be unambiguously assigned, and that we must therefore resign the hope of attaining by any empirical consideration of the received doctrine a precise determination of the nature and limits of logical theory.
[9:14:784]

5. In order to make clear the reasons for this astonishing diversity of opinion regarding the province and method of logic, and so make some advance towards a solution of what may well be called the logical problem, it seems necessary to consider some of the leading conceptions of logic, with such reference to details as will suffice to show how difference of fundamental view determines the treatment of special logical problems. In this consideration the order must be historical rather than systematic. Not, indeed, that it is needful, nor is it proposed, to present an historical account of philosophy at large, or even of logic in particular; our purpose is merely to disentangle and bring clearly forward the nature of the principles respecting logical theory which have served as basis for the most characteristic logical systems. Such an inquiry will not only assist in explaining the divergencies of logical systems, but throw light upon the essence of logic itself.^[10. ∖ For a notice of works on the history of logic, see note A p. 802. ]

In this historico-critical survey, the first section must naturally be devoted to a consideration of the Aristotelian logic. The records of Oriental attempts at analysis of the procedure of thought may, for our present purpose, be disregarded.^[11. For a⅛otιce of some of the more developed systems of Oriental logic, see note B p. 802. ] The Aristotelian Logic.

6. In a remarkable passage at the close of the tract called by us the Sophistical Refutations, Aristotle claims for himself distinct originality in the conception of subjecting to analysis the forms or types of argument. “The system I have expounded had not been partially, though imperfectly, elaborated by others; its very foundations had to be laid The teachers of rhetoric in herited many principles that had long been ascertained; dialectic had absolutely no traditional doctrines. Our researches were long, tentative, and troublesome. If, then, starting from nothing, it bears a comparison with others that have been developed by division of labour in successive generations, candid criticism will be readier to commend it for the degree of completeness to which it has attained than to find fault with it for falling short of perfection.”^[12. The above translation, which is somewhat free, is taken from Mr Poste s edition of the Sophistici Elenchi, p. 95. ] Although the specific reference in this passage is to the analysis of dialectical argument contained in the Topica, the same claim might with justice have been made in regard to the more extensive analysis of the forms of reasoning in general which makes up the substance of the other books of the Organon. There had been, prior to Aristotle, much discussion of problems that would under any view be included under the head of logic, but no systematic attempt had been made to analyse knowledge as a whole in its formal aspect, to throw under general heads or classes the types of reasoning, whether dialectical or scientific, and to exhibit the general relations in which the elements of all reasoning stand to one another. After Aristotle, it became possible to refer all such discussions to a common head, and to view them as component parts of one systematic doctrine. In a peculiar sense, then, Aristotle may be described as the founder of logical science.

The precise nature of the inquiries falling within the scope of the Aristotelian logic may receive some preliminary explanation supplementary to that which can only be given by a careful study of the chief theorems of the system, if there be taken into account (a) the advances towards a theory of logical method contained in the speculations of earlier Greek thinkers, (δ) the classification of philosophic discipline which underlies the body of Aristotle’s writings, and (c) the general conception of the matter of logical analysis which may be deduced from any special or incidental treatment of the question in Aristotle. Of these in order.

7. (a) Logical discussions prior to Aristotle.

The inquiries which find a place in the Aristotelian logic are all, in a large sense, problems of the theory of knowledge. They arise, therefore, only in connexion with critical reflexion on the nature, grounds, and method of knowledge. The earliest forms of Greek speculation, turning rather upon explanation of natural fact, being in essence attempts to reduce the multiplicity of known fact to unity of principle, contain, as a consequence, problems of a metaphysical character, which might involve problems of strictly logical character, but were logical only in potentiality. Of all these metaphysical questions the most important centre round the tundamental opposition between unity of principle and multi-P⅛c u ° 1 lac h between the one and the many, an opposition which under varied forms presents itself at every stage in the history of philosophic speculation. In the first period of Greek speculation, the problem presented' itself jn its simplest, most direct aspect, and, after a few rough attempts at a quasi-physical explanation of the genesis of many out of one, there come forward, as reasoned, ultimate solutions, the Eleatic doctrine that only unity has real being, the Heraclitic counter-doctrine that only in change, in the many, is truth to be found, and the Pythagorean notion of number, harmony, as containing in abstracto the union of the opposites, one and many. No one of these philosophic treatments can be said to contain specifically logical elements, but they raise questions of a logical kind, and, especially in the records of the Eleatic views, one can trace a close approximation to the critical reflexion which marks the transition to a new order of ideas. Results which in these systems are stared with metaphysical reference only, reappear with new aspect among the sophists and the Socratic schools. The transition stage, indeed, partly aided by the atomic separation of objective fact from subjective sense experience, is mainly the effect of the sophistic and Socratic teaching. Socrates and the sophists have this in common that both treat the fundamental problem of philosophy as it hàd been handed down with special reference to the subjective experience of the individual. In the teaching of the sophists generally is to be discerned the opposition between subjective reflexion and objective fact; in that of Protagoras and Gorgias in particular there appear as problems of the theory of knowledge difficulties for the older metaphysic of Heraclitus and the Eleatics respectively. The Heraclitic principle of change is the general foundation for the doctrine that the momentary perception is the only fact of cognition, and upon it may be based the conclusions that all truth is relative to the individual state of the individual subject, and that judgment, as a mode of expressing truth, is a contradiction in itself. Thus the extreme Heracliteans, as Cratylus, rejected the proposition, or combination of words, as expressing a unity and permanence not to be found in things, and reduced speech to the symbolism of pointing with the finger. .Less developed but not less clear is the connexion between the brief scèptical theses of Gorgias and the Eleatic doctrine of unity. As knowledge was impossible on the Heraclitean view, since it implied a synthesis not discoverable amidst incessant change, so for Gorgias knowledge was impossible, since in the synthesis was involved an element of difference, multiplicity, not reconcilable with the all-embracing unity of things. It is evident from the treatment of such views in Plato and in Aristotle, how many of the illustrations used in support of the general thesis depended for their apparent strength on neglect of some of the elementary conditions of thought, and how inevitably reflexion upon these difficulties led to the construction of a theory of thought. The first outlines of such a theory are to be found in the Socratic principle of the notion (or concept, as we may call it, for the notion as viewed by Socrates is certainly the concrete class notion, the simple result of generalization and abstraction), and to Socrates is assigned by Aristotle the first statement of two important logical processes—induction, or the collection of particulars from which by critical comparison a generalized result might be drawn, and definition, or the explicit statement of the general elements disclosed by critical comparison of instances.^[13. Metaph., 1078b, 27-29. ] In the Socratic teaching, so far as records go, no explicit reference was made to the problems in connexion with which those processes are of greatest significance, but in the lesser Socratic schools on the one hand, and in Plato on the other, we find the new principle either brought to bear upon the old difficulties, or developed into a comprehensive method.

The Socratic concept contains in itself the union of one and many, but it is in nature subjective; it is a mode of knowledge. If, then, it be regarded as only subjective, the old difficulties reappear. How is it possible to reconcile, even in thought, an opposition so fundamental as that between unity and plurality? Must there not be a like irreconcilable opposition between the subjective counterparts of these objective relations, between the individual notion, the atom of knowledge, and the proposition or definition? How, indeed, can there be a combination in thought of that which is in essence uncombinable? Whether we take Aristippus, who draws mainly for theory of knowledge on the Heraclitic-Protagorqan sources, or Antisthenes, who leans towards the Eleatic, or the Megarics, who also, in accordance with the Eleatic thoughts, devoted chief attention to the polemical aspect of the theory, we find a set of problems appearing, the solution of which imperatively called for a theory of knowledge as the combination of one and many. Perhaps the most interesting of these early thinkers, so far as the history of logic is concerned, is Antisthenes, whose extreme nominalism presents the most curious analogies to some recent logical work.^[14. On Antisthenes, see the third part of the Theaetetus, which appears, beyond doubt, to refer to him (comp. Peipers, Untersuchungen uber das System Plato's, 1874, pp. 124-48), and Aristotle, Metaphysics, 1024b, 32; 1043b, 24; Topica, 104b, 21. ] According to Antisthenes, the world of cognizable[9:14:785] fact consists of combinations of elementary parts (πρώτα). These πρώτα appear in cognition as irreducible elements denoted by the simplest elements of speech, names. The name is the mark for the sense-impression by which each πρώτον is communicated to us, for they are only known by sense, and are strictly individual. A composite thing is known through the combination of names of its parts, and such a combination (συμπλοκή) is a proposition or definition (λ6yos). Each thing has its specific λJγos (olκeios λ6yos), and a judgment is merely the expression of this. There is therefore no distinction of subject and predicate possible; even identical propositions, the only possible forms under this theory, are mere repetitions of the complex name. Predication is either impossible or reduces itself to naming in the predicate what is named in the subject. It is the simple result of so consistent a nominalism that all truth is arbitrary or relative; there is no possibility of contradiction, not even of one’s self.

The theory of Antisthenes, strange as it may at first sight appear, rested on certain metaphysical difficulties, which lie at the root of all the perplexity regarding the import of propositions, and it is not too much to say that these difficulties were kept continually in mind by Plato and Aristotle in their several attempts to explain the nature of knowledge. Both thinkers find themselves confronted with the ultimate question, What is the ground of unity in things known, and in what way does thought unite the detached attributes of things into a subjective whole? What is the nature of the unity which binds things, themselves in a sense units, into classes or wholes, and how comes it that in the judgment subject and predicate are, in a sense, set at one?

In Plato, for whom the solution was found in the participation in or imitation of ideas by things, we find more distinctly conceived the series of logical processes involved obscurely in the Socratic method. So far as positive statements regarding the ideas can carry one, it may be said that in essence these processes concern only the formation of or deduction from the concrete universal concept or general notion. The ideas, in the Platonic system, at least in reference to the thought which apprehends them, resemble most closely class notions. A deeper significance often appears to attach to the relative processes of induction, whereby the resemblances of things, the idea in them, is disclosed, definition, whereby the content of the idea is made explicit, and division, whereby the external connexion of ideas with one another, their system, is deduced, but such significance attaches to the more purely metaphysical aspects of the theory, and had no particular bearing on the Aristotelian treatment of the same problems. Not much is given in Plato towards a theory of the proposition, though sometimes an analysis of its elements is sketched; and the method of division could yield only a few of the types of deductive reasoning. But, over and above these more definite contributions towards the construction of a theory of knowledge, there are general aspects of the Platonic work of not secondary importance for the Aristotelian logic. In Plato the fundamental differences of earlier philosophic views appear in a new phase, and are elevated to a higher stage. Sophistic method is analysed, not as in forms actually existing, but in its essential features, and the opposition between sophist and philosopher is viewed as the opposition between opinion and knowledge. Heraclitic principle of change and Eleatic doctrine of unity are resolved into the more comprehensive opposition of the universal and the particular, while hints of an ultimate solution, of a universal which is at once and perse particular, are not wanting. The Socratic method of thought appears as that by which alone a solution of philosophic difficulties is to be obtained, and the consideration of thought in its relation to facts is marked out for special investigation. A deeper view of thought was thus made at once possible and necessary.

8. (b) Much, then, had been effected by Aristotle’s predecessors in the way of preparing a definite body of problems and a method of dealing with them, problems and method which might fairly be said to belong to a theory of knowledge as such, and from the occasional references in the Organon to opinions of contemporaries it is evident that many isolated attempts at solution of such questions were being carried on. In Aristotle we find a systematic examination of many of these problems, but it is left by him doubtful what place in the general scheme of philosophic sciences should be assigned to it. The distribution into physics, mathematics, and first philosophy, or the wider classification of doctrines as poetic, practical, or theoretical, in no way enables us to class logic or the body of speculations making up the Organon. That the forms of proof analysed in these writings are of universal scope is unambiguously declared; that the first principles assumed in all proof are dealt with in first philosophy is also made clear; but the relations between the two doctrines so reciprocally related cannot be determined from any statement made by Aristotle himself. That he should have regarded the inquiries of the analytics as propaedeutic in character, and should have held that those who assume to discuss problems of first philosophy ought to have made themselves acquainted with the general theory of proof, is intelligible, and more than this significance cannot, we think, be assigned to the passage in the Metaphysics, on the ground of which the logical inquiries have been classed as the general, common introduction to the whole system.^[15. I Metaph. . iv. 1005b, 2. See Zeller, Ph. d. Gr., ii. 2 (3d ed.), p. 184, n. ; Rassow, De Definit. Not., 46, 47; Schwegler, Comment zur Metaph., iii. 161; and, contra, Prantl, Gesch. der Logik, 1 137. Zeller maintains the view that Aristotle intends to indicate the place occupied by the analytics in his general scheme of philosophy. ] For the close connexion between the analytical researches of the Organon and the inquiry into essence or .being as such forbids us to accept, in any strict sense, a separation of these as forming distinct and independent sciences. To metaphysics is assigned the consideration of the principles of proof, and the kind of inquiry making up first philosophy is described by Aristotle in a fashion which assimilates it most closely to the researches of the analytics. That which is left undecided by the Aristotelian classification is the relation of the logical inquiries to the organic whole of which first philosophy is the main or sole part.^[16. On Aristotle’s use of the term λογικόν and its allies, see (in addition to waitz, Com. in Organ., ii. p. 353-55) Schwegler, Commentar zu Ar. Metaph. , vol. iv. p.. 48-51. ] To obtain any fresh light we must turn to the consideration of indications supplied by Aristotle as to the nature of the inquiries grouped under the head Analytics.

9. (c) Such indications are unfortunately most scanty. As we probably have not the Metaphysics in its full extent, actual or contemplated, the want of a clear separation between the inquiries belonging specially to first philosophy and those appropriate to the analytical researches may be due in part to the deficiency of our materials. There are, however, two lines of separation discernible, from which some useful inferences may be drawn. What we call the logic of Aristotle, i.e., the treatises making up the Organon, is roughly divisible into three parts :—(1) the formal analysis of syllogism and its allied types of reasoning, with the more particular discussion of the elementary parts of reasoning—the proposition;

(2) the theory of scientific proof and definition (apodictic); (3) the theory of probable arguments, or of reasoning based on currently received opinions and leading to conclusions more or less probable (dialectic). Certainly for Aristotle there was no such distinction between the first and the remaining two parts as would in any way correspond to the modern separation of general or formal logic from the theory of knowledge, or material logic; the three parts in conjunction make up one body of doctrine. Now dialectic is very specially indicated as being of a formal character, i.e., as dealing with no special matter, but with κοινά, opinions, or types of opinions common to all sciences.^[17. See Anal. Post., i. 11; Rhet., i. 1, and in many passages. Cf. Heyder, Method, d. Arist., p. 348.∙ ] Apodictic, we may assume, is in like manner the formal study of what constitutes knowledge strictly so-called, the nature of the principles on which knowledge rests, the special marks distinguishing it, and the method by which knowledge is framed. But in every body of doctrine we may distinguish, according to Aristotle, three things,—the genus or class of objects with which the demonstration is concerned, the essential or fundamental attributes, qualities of these objects, which are to be demonstrated of them, and, thirdly, certain common axioms or principles of demonstration, not themselves demonstrable, and not entering as integral parts into the demonstration, but lying in the background as security for the reasoning carried out by thought employing them. Can anything corresponding to these three facts be discovered, if we assume for the moment, what certainly is not explicitly stated by Aristotle, that analytic constitutes a special body of doctrine? The genus or class about which the doctrine is concerned can only be reasoning itself, either as apodictic or dialectic, and the latter for a special reason may be left out of account; aπ6δeιξιs, then, is the matter concerning which the doctrine is put forward. But aπoδeιξιs is a form of knowledge, that is to say, is subjective. The properties, therefore, of apodictic science can only be made clear if we consider on the one hand the objective counterparts of necessity and universality in thought, and on the other hand the nature of universality and necessity of thought itself. The common principles or axioms, finally, can only be such presuppositions as are made in apodictic or reasoning generally respecting thought in its relation to fact, as grasping or apprehending reality. The consideration of such axioms, it has been already seen, pertains to first philosophy. Analytics then would appear as an independent doctrine, holding of first philosophy on the one hand, both in regard of the common axioms and in regard of the attributes of being, by which it is a possible object of science, and on the other hand referring to the subjective treatment of thought, whether· in relation to principles or to fact generally.

A very similar result may be attained if we follow out a line of distinction indicated in more than one portion of the Metaphysics. ^[18. Metaph., vi. 4, v. 29, ix. 10. Cf. Schwegler, Com., iii. 241, iv. 29 iq., 186; and Brentano, Bedeutung des Seienden nach Arist., 21 so. ] Separating the modes in which being is spoken of into four—(1) τi> bv κατά συμβeβτηκos ; (2) τδ bv is aληθes κal τb μή bv ωs τi> ι ∣ ∕eυδos;

(3) τδ t>v κατά τα σχήματα τηs κατηγορίας ; (4) τi> t>v δυvaμeι καί fvepγel<f — Aristotle excludes the second from the special researches peculiar to first philosophy, the study of being as being, but neither excludes it from general consideration in metaphysics as a whole, [9:14:786] nor handles it at length, deferring it rather for more detailed treatment. A comparatively clear account, however, of what is understood by him under the head of being as truth and non-being as falsity may be extracted from the various passages referred to, and little doubt can remain that being so regarded is in a peculiar sense the matter of analytical (i,e., logical) researches.

Being as truth and non-being as falsity refer to and rest upon combination and division of the elementary parts of thought. For truth and falsity have no significance when applied to things, but only to the connexion of thought which is dominated by the one principle of non-contradiction. Nay, thinking has not even immediate and direct reference to being as such, but only to being as the existent, as qualified, or quantified, or modified in some other way (i.e,, according to the categories), and it is in its very essence the conjunction or unifying of elements. What cannot be conjoined, as, e.g., the notions of elementary facts themselves, are not either true or false, and are not matters of thought. Thought thus moves in a definite sphere, that of the combinable or separable, the correspondence of conceptions with real relations, and has its limits on the one hand in the elementary data apprehended by intellect (vois=reason), and on the other handin the infinite sea of particular, accidental qualifications of things (συμβeβηκ0ra). The possibility of contradictory assertions (for true and false judgments together make up the contradiction, τδ δe σύνολον πeρl μepισμbv avτιφa<rιωs) is the distinguishing mark of thought. Now it is this very possibility that lies at the root of all the analytical researches. Not, indeed, that one can assume for Aristotle a view which has appeared in later logical works, that all forms of logical reasoning are to be deduced from the principle of contradiction. Quite the reverse. The common axioms underlie all processes of proof, direct or indirect, but they do not enter into or form part of proof. Nothing can be deduced from them; but their authority can be appealed to against any one who refuses to allow a conclusion reached by a correct syllogism from true premisses.^[19. Cf. generally Anal. Post., i. 14. ] (The nerve of logical proof would thus lie in the disjunctive proposition; either this conclusion is to be granted or the principle of contradiction is denied. ) Now the analytical researches are in especial the treatment of combination and separation in thought. For even the syllogism may be regarded as only a complex judgment or synthesis, and in the exposition of the forms of combination and separation we shall find a complete system extending from the unproved principles and exhibiting the methods according to which thought proceeds towards the determination of the essential properties of things or the discrimination of various heads under which the transitory and accidental attributes may be advantageously classed.

So far then as one can judge, the matter of Aristotle’s analytical researches may be expressed as the concrete nature of thought, characterized by its fundamental attribute, the possibility of contradiction, correlated with the real system of things, and having as its end the realization of systematic knowledge, i.e., the adequate subjective interpretation of being.

10. The indication that the analytics have to do with being as conceived by thought, conducted under the general axiom of noncontradiction and expressed in language, requires to be filled up by a more detailed treatment of the Aristotelian theory of thought in relation to being. Upon the characteristics assigned to thought or knowledge in this special relation, must depend the general nature of the Aristotelian logic, the determination of the scope of logical treatment, and the essence of logical method. For from a quite similar statement regarding the province within which logic moves totally diverse conclusions might be drawn respecting the precise function of logical method. One might have either a formal doctrine or technic, or a real methodology, either an attempt to evolve logical principles from the axiom of contradiction, or a development of the laws according to which thought, necessarily acting under the said axiom, proceeds towards the construction of knowledge. The history of logic clearly shows how differently the matter of the analytics may be viewed. For one of the possible conclusions, that logic is a technic or quasi-mathematical exposition of formal relations, has been accepted as the undoubted result of Aristotle’s teaching, and has so prevailed as to make itself the current conception.^[20. Cf. Brandis, Gr.-röm. Phil., ii. 373-75. ] The other, the view of logic as theory of the method of scientific thought, has been cast entirely into the background, so far as logical doctrines are concerned, and, if allowed at all, has been regarded as foundation for a species of applied logic, an appendix to the other,

11 ∙ ι Not much aid is afforded directly by any classification or division of the books now collected together as the Organon. As above noted, the Prior and Posterior Analytics with the Topics form one connected whole, while the Categories and the De Bnunciationc stand apart as isolated treatments of special problems, not organically or necessarily part of the research. The genuineness of both these treatises has been doubted, (see ArIstotle, vol. ii. p. 514) and it is not improbable that both are redactions of Aristotelian material, perhaps drawing from other lost writings of Aristotle, perhaps based on oral teaching, by some Aristotelian scholar. A summary view of the contents of the other books will be found at vol. ii. p. 516.

12. The logical researches as a whole manifest a strong unity, and at the same time refer to one fundamental opposition, that between apodwtic and dialectic reasoning.^[21. Tlιe most important treatments of the principles and details of the Aristotelian logic, which are here drawn upon freely, are (1), instar omnium, that of Prantl (Gesch. d. Logik, i. pp. 87-346); (2) that of Brandis, Aristoteles, pp. 148-434, and Aristotelisches Lehrgebäude, pp. 12-62 (in which there is sharp criticism of Prantl’s view); (3) that of Grote, Aristotle, vols. i. and ii. pp. 1-134 (most patient and accurate, but tending continuously to minimize the speculative element); (4) that of St Hilaire, in his essay De la Logique d'Aristote, 2 vols., 1838, and in his translation of the organon ; (5) that of Biese, Phil. d. Arist., i. 44-319. Trendelenburg’s Elementa Logices Aristotelem, waitz’s edition of the organon, and Ueberweg’s System der Logik contain much of value. Mr Poste’s translation of the Post. Anal, and Sophis. Elenchi, Mr E. wallace’s outlines of the Phil, of Aristotle, and Mr Magrath’s Selections from the organon will also be found of service. ]

The opposition between apodictic and dialectic is in the Aristotelian system the development of that which had already played so important a part in Plato and Socrates, the distinction between science and opinion. Knowledge in the strict sense had there presented itself as the generalized notion referring to being in its very essence, and resting on thought or reason. Opinion is the quasiknowledge of the particular, referring to that which is not being but only accident, and resting on sense or imagination. In the Platonic method this distinction had come forward as the underlying basis for the opposition of philosophy and sophistical rhetoric; in Aristotle a much more precise formulation is given of the characteristics of the two opposed forms of thought, and the connexion between opinion or dialectic and rhetorico-sophistical discussion is made more concrete and profound. Dialectic, with Aristotle, is the system resulting from the attempt to reduce to rule or generalize modes of argument which rest upon current received doctrines as principles, which move within the region of interests about which current opinions pro and con are to be found, and which terminate not in the decisive solution of a problem but in clearing the way for a more profound research or at least in the establishment of the thesis as against an opponent. Dialectic, then, has no special province; it deals with κοινά or erδoξα, and its methods are perfectly general. On the one hand, as being the application of reasoning, it refers to and employs the specific types of reasoning, syllogism and induction; on the other hand, as being applied to matters of opinion, and borrowing its principles from current floating dicta about matters of common interest, the types of reasoning tend in it to assume special forms resembling those employed in rhetoric (which is a kind of offshoot from dialectic—the application of dialectic to political principles). The province of dialectic being thus essentially vague, the matters about which dialectic reasoning is concerned being of the most fluctuating character, there must be, for Aristotle, the greatest difficulty in determining, per se and apart from the opposition to apodictic, what is the character of dialectic syllogism and induction. Nor can it be said that the interpreter of Aristotle has an easy task in the endeavour to discover what precisely is dialectical reasoning and in what way the forms which are assumed to be common both to apodictic and dialectic come to have any application to the fluctuating mass of current opinions. It is comparatively simple to say apodictic and dialectic differ in this, that the one rests on principles essential, necessary, seen to be true, while the other proceeds from data which are merely received as credible and as containing probable, received opinions on a subject about which there may be difference of view; and it may be added that in the one we reach conclusions which are essential, in which the predicate is necessarily and universally true of the subject, while in the other the conclusion remains, like the data, credible merely, and is, at best, only one of the probable answers to a question. But there remains the difficulty, which is certainly not cleared up by any direct statement from Aristotle—of what nature is the syllogistic inference that applies to material of this kind? what is the nervus probandi in a dialectic syllogism? There are two possible views— either that the principle of syllogistic inference is purely formal, deducible from the characteristic of thought as either affirming or denying in reference to a particular subject, and therefore capable of application either to probable or to necessary matter, or that the syllogism is explicable only as a form in which knowledge is established and is applicable but per accidens, as one may express it, to probable matters. Under this second view, the possibility and reality of syllogistic inference would be traced to the correlative peculiarities of human thought and of the nature of the objects of thought, and it would follow that in strictness there is no dialectic syllogism. Such a conclusion at first sight appears to stand in sharp opposition to quite emphatic utteτances^of Aristotle, but if we suppose, for the sake of example, that a dialectic syllogism were framed, we should readily discern that the link of connexion between data and conclusion, the nervus probandi, as it may be called, does not in fact differ from that involved in the apodictic syllogism. The merely probable character of the data prevents the conclusion [9:14:787] from having a higher value than mere likelihood, but does not affect the chain of inference, which proceeds on assumptions identical with these involved in apodictic. Aristotle is chary of any examples of dialectic syllogism, and indeed, if one considers that all forms of modality are investigated in the general analysis of syllogism, it becomes difficult to see what specially distinguishes dialectic inference. It is not to be denied, however, that the investigation of the grounds for the coexistence of dialectic and apodictic is incomplete in Aristotle, as it confessedly is in Plato.

Unless, then, it can be shown beyond possibility of question that Aristotle does lay down purely formal rules for syllogism, rules deducible simply from the fundamental axiom of thought—and the evidence on which such a view is based will be examined later—we do not obtain much light from the opposition between dialectic and apodictic. More important results, however, are gained when we consider the Aristotelian doctrine of genuine knowledge, of άπόδειξις, for, among the numerous elements that here fall to be noted, some are of quite general import, and apply to the whole process of the formation of knowledge.

13. Apodictic knowledge generally is definable through the special marks of its content. It deals with the universal and necessary, that which is now and always, that which cannot be other than it is, that which is what it is simply through its own nature. It is the expression of the true universal in thought and things, τδ καθόλου. Further, as a method, άπόδειξις is characterized by the nature of its starting point, and of the connecting link involved, as well as by the peculiarity of its result. It rests upon the first, simplest, best known, unprovable elements of thought, the πρώτα και άμεσα, which are not themselves in the strict sense matters of apodictic science, which are αναπόδεικτα. In all the intermediate processes of scientific proof there is involved generally this dependence upon previously established principles, and, when apodictic is taken in its ultimate abstraction, these previously established principles are seen to be the prior, ultimate elements, assumptions in thought about things, as one may provisionally describe them. The peculiar connexion involved is simply what we understand by the principle, of syllogism. No syllogism is possible without the universalizing element, the καθόλου, and knowledge in its essence is syllogistic.^[22. Cf. Topics, pp. 164a. 10. ] The conclusion of the syllogism in which essential attributes are attached to a subject is the concretion or closing together of the two aspects of all thought and being, the universal and particular.^[23. See specially Anal. Pr., 67a, 39 sq., and compare the elaborate note of Kampe. Erkenntnistheorie des Aris.,p. 220 (also p. 84). Grote (Aristotle, i. p. 263a) remarks: “Complete cognition (to èvepyeîv, according to the view here set forth) consists of one mental act corresponding to the major premise, another corresponding to the minor, and a third including both the two in conscious juxtaposition. The third implies both the first and the second.” The connexion between this and the Aristotelian doctrines of vous in its relation to αiσ0nσις will not escape attention. ]

The fuller explanation of apodictic thus refers us to three points of extreme importance in the Aristotelian theory of knowledge, the precise nature of the καθόλου, which presents itself as the characteristic feature of aπoδειξιs, the relation of fundamental and universal in things on which the possibility of aπoδειζιs is founded, and the forms of thought through which the universal and particular factors are subjectively realized. The three are most closely connected, and as they involve the main difficulties of the Aristotelian philosophy as a whole, a general treatment of them is indispensable. First then of τi ∣ καθόλου, the characteristic term in the explanation of knowledge. This notion is essentially double-sided. On the one side it is the universal of empirical knowledge, the generic or class universal—it is τb κατά παντός ; on the other hand, it is the root or ground of the empirical universal—it is τδ καθ' al ∣ τι> και îj αυτό, ^[24. , Anal. Post., 73b, 26, καθόλου fié λeγω ο άυ κατά παντός τε υπάρχη καί καθ' αύτό και ρ αυτό See Index Aristotelicw. s. t>., pp. 356-57, and on καθ' αυτό compare Heyder, Method, d. Arist., 310 n., and Bonitz, Corn, in Met., pp. 265-66. Ou the distinction between καθόλου and γeVoς, see Bonitz, Com. in Met., p. 299, 300: Zeller. Ph. d. Gr., ii. 1, p. 205, 206. ] that which is in, for, and through itself, the essential. Now the essential, κaθl αυτό, is, in the first place, either that which enters into the being and notion of a thing as a necessary prerequisite (for example, line is a necessary element in the being and notion of triangle), or that which is the necessary basis of an attribute (e.g., line iu reference to straight and curved), or in the second place that which is as subject only and not as predicate, or finally that which is per sc the cause or ground of a fact or event^[25. Cf. Prantl, Ges. d. Logik, i. 121, 122, who has rightly placed the function of κaBoλoυ in the foreground. ]? Thus the function of thought (of apodictic) is the exposition with reference to a determined class of objects of all that necessarily inheres in them, on account of the elementary factors which determine their existence and nature. Real things, individual objects, are the basis of all knowledge, but in these individuals the elementary parts, causally connected, and leading to ulterior consequences, form the general element about which there may be demonstrative science. Thought which operates upon them does so, as we have already seen, under the peculiar restriction of its very nature, as the subjective reali zation of the notion of things, and the principles expressing this restriction, the logical axioms, maybe appealed to if demonstration be opposed groundlessly, but these axioms do not enter into the process of demonstration. “When the apodictic process has attained its end, that is, when all the universal propositions relating to a given class, with insight)iuto the necessary character of the predication in each case, have been gathered up, then the καθόλου of knowledge in respect to that class has been realized.”^[26. Prantl, i. 126. ] s

14. Probably the example of apodictic which Aristotle bears chiefly in mind is mathematical science, and in his treatment of the characteristic marks of this doctrine most of the peculiarities of apodictic occur. In mathematical science abstraction is made of the material qualities of the things considered, of those qualities which give to them a place as physical facts, but the abstracta are not to be conceived as entities, self-existing. They are not even to be conceived as existing only in mind, as ideal types; they truly exist in things, but are considered separately (^ξ aφ>aιρεσεωs). The first principles of mathematical science are few and definite, and the procedure is continuously from the simple and absolutely more known to the concrete and relatively more known. As in proof generally, so in mathematical demonstration, an essential quality (συμβεβτηκ6s κa(f al>τb) may be proved of a subject, and yet such quality may be still accidental, i.e., not predicated of the subject on account of its generic constituent marks, but capable of being deduced from the constituent mark of that which enters into the subject, as, e.g., a given figure’s exterior angles are equal to four right angles. Why? Because it is an isosceles triangle. Why has an isosceles this property? Because it is a triangle. Why has a triangle? Because it is a rectilineal figure. If this reason is ultimate, it completes our knowledge, και καθόλου δε τότε. ^[27. Anal. Post., i. 24, 86a, 2. ] Thus the range of mathematical proof extends from the πρώτα, the original definitions, which at the same time assume the existence of the things defined, through the determinations καθ' αυτά to the qualities (συμβεβi]κoτa), which can be shown to attach to their subjects, to be in a sense καθ' αυτά, while a continuous series of middle notions, concerning which there cannot be much ambiguity, effects the transition. Moreover, in mathematical science, one can see with the utmost evidence the correlation of reason and sense, which will presently appear as a fundamental factor in Aristotle’s general theory of knowledge. The πρώτα are not to be conceived as innate or as possessed before experience. They are seen or envisaged, intuited in perception by voυs, and induction here as elsewhere is the process by which perceptions are gathered together for the reflective and intuiting action of νους. In the mathematical individual, more evidently than in any other case, is visible the union of thought and sense. The demonstration which employs a diagram does not turn upon any properties of the diagram which are there for sense only, not for reason, but upon the general elementary relations contemplated in thought.^[28. Cf. the passage from De Memor., p. 450, quoted by Brandis, Aristoteles, p. 1133,— συμβαίνει yip το αυτό πάθος iv τψ ∣'θβιv καί lv τω όιαγράφειν" εκεί τε yap t>υθlv πpoσχpωμεvoι τω τ⅛ ιroσi>ι> ώρισμένον είναι τό τρίγωνον, όμως γράφομεν ώρισμένον κατά το ποσόν' καί ό νοών ωσαύτως, κάν μη ποσόν vojj, τίθεται προ όμμάτων ποσόν, νοεί δ'οΰχ j) ποσόν. αν £έ ή φνσις >5 των ποσών, αόριστον όέ, τίθεται μεν ποσόν ώρισμένον, νοεί Si jJ ποσόν μόνον.

Aristotle’s view strongly resembles, in this point at least, that of Kant. ] In mathematical development, that which is potentially contained in the υλη voητh on which mathematical thinking operates is brought forward into actuality by the constructive processes through which the proof is mediated, and the potential knowledge contained in the intuition of mathematical elements becomes actual through the process of constructive thought.^[29. See Metaph., ix. c?9, p. 1051a. Some interesting remarks on the process of mathematical construction and its relation to syllogistic proof will be found in Ueberweg's System der Logik, § 101, p. 273. ]

Finally, the relation of pure mathematical reasoning to that found in sciences generically one with mathematics, e.g., optics, astronomy, harmonics, &c., furnishes an interesting example of the relation between reasoning based on fact and on causal ground.^[30. See generally Anal. Post., chap. 13. Of Aristotle's views on mathematics the best expositions seem to be those of Biese (Ph. d. Arist., ii. 216-34), Brandis (Aristoteles, pp. 135-39. and Aristot. Lehrgebäude, 7-11), and Kucken (M⅛hode d. Arist. Forschung, pp. 56-66) ]

15. The process of άπόδειξις generally and of mathematical demonstration in particular has brought into clear light the prominent characteristic of knowledge according to the Aristotelian view. Knowledge must always be regarded from two sides, as having relation to the universal, and as bearing upon the particular.^[31. Cf. specially Anal. Pr., ii. 21. ] It is in itself the union of the general and the particular, of the universal and the individual. This fundamental notion of knowledge is not only the integral element in the Aristotelian theory of science, but also the guiding principle in his scientific method.^[32. This is excellently put by Eucken, op. rit., pp. 44-55. ] In all cases we require to keep iu mind the necessary correlation of the particular facts and the general grounds, the multiplicity of effects and the unity of cause. The one element is not apart from the other. Universals as such are of no avail either as explanations of knowledge or as grounds of existence. Particulars as such are infinite, indefinite, [9:14:788] and. incognizable. Only in’ the union of these, a union which objectively regarded is the combination of form and matter, of potentiality and actuality, of genus and ultimate difference, subjectively is the combination of the data of sense, imagination, and intuitive faculty of reason, is knowledge possible. And the methods by which knowledge is formed in us regarding things exhibit the same twofold aspect. Syllogism as the form of the process from generalia to the determination of attributes of the individual subject, induction as the method of procedure from the vaguely apprehended individuals to the generalia or principles, alike, when analysed, exhibit the conjunction of the universal and particular.

16. In each branch of knowledge there are involved the specific genus or class, the attributes concerning which there is to be demonstration, and the common axioms or principles. Each branch, moreover, implies special principles, ϊδιαι apχal ; there is no all-comprehensive science from which truths are to be deduced, and from the common maxims alone nothing can be inferred. 'Aτroδeιξιs involves principles, and starts therefore of necessity with what maybe called definitions. Yet definitions are at the same time the final result of apodictic demonstration, and the original assumptions may be pushed farther and farther back till they appear as the πpωτaι κdl ⅛μeσoι πpoτaσeιs which are only apprehended by vaυs. From this distinction between knowledge as completed and knowledge as in process of formation, as from the distinction between sciences of the same genus as more or less general {e.g., geometry and optics), there follow the distinctions between propositions necessary and propositions true lπl τb πολύ, between proof of fact and proof of essence, between deduction and induction, between syllogism as generic form of all proof, and the special type of syllogism in which completed knowledge is expressed. We are thus enabled to reconcile what seem at first sight discrepancies in the Aristotelian doctrine,—as, e.g., the insistance upon induction as furnishing the principles of reasoning (τά καθόλου) coupled with the attempt to show that induction too is a kind of syllogism; the explanation of proof as involving essence, coupled with the admission of syllogisms of fact; the treatment of propositions as necessary and contingent in themselves, coupled with the distinction between eπιστ⅛μη and δόξα. In all forms of knowledge there is the twofold aspect, that which turns upon the essential connexions, and that which refers to the isolated facts wherein such connexions make their appearance. Syllogistic as formal analysis of what is common in all knowledge is one part of the all-comprehensive theory of knowledge, an integral but not a self-existing part.^[33. passages in which an apparently formal view of logical relations is expressed are mainly the following Topics, i. chap. vi. (in which the fundamental logical forms of definition, genus, property, and accident are explained by refer- e . nce , t0 n th θ coincidence of the spheres of subject and predicate in a proposition); Anal. Post., 1. chap. 26 (συλλογισμόν eστιv, ôç αν ούτως ίχρ, ωστe f ολον προς pepos η μέρος προ? ολον εχειν); Anal. Post., ii. 3 (έτε'ρου δέ έτέρα άπόδει£ις, èàv μη ωs μepos « τι της όλης, τούτο δέ λέγω, ότι δέδεικται το ισοσκελές δύο όρθαίς, ei παν τρίγωνον δeδeυcτar μέρος yip∙ τόδ’ ίίλον); Rhetoric, i. 2, § 19.

17. The general idea of the Aristotelian analytic thus obtained does not require to be supplemented by any detailed survey of the logical system into which it is evolved, but a brief summary of the most important points and indication of the relation in which the parts stand to the whole may be of advantage.

The simplest form of knowledge, that in which being as true or false is apprehended, is the judgment. The consideration of the judgment is therefore the first part of the analytical researches. Here Aristotle distinguishes more accurately than any of his predecessors (indeed for the first time with accuracy) between subject and predicate as integral parts, symbolized by the noun and verb, and signifying the relations for us of things as appearing under the schemata of the categories. The material basis of the judgment, as one may call it, is the thing as an object of possible knowledge, i.e., the thing as individual (and therefore as involving matter and form, the particular and the general), as qualified, specifically, in time, space, quantity, and relation, and existing as one mode in the universal nexus of potentiality and actuality. These metaphysical forms, and, specially, the deep-lying modes of potentiality and actuality, reflect themselves in the forms whereby subjectively knowledge is realized in us, and the resulting knowledge is conditioned partly by them, partly by the modes in which intellect as a reality is developed in us. The proposition has necessarily a reference to them, and thus alongside of formal distinctions between universal, particular, singular, and indefinite judgments we have the distinctions between necessary, contingent, and possible, which appear partly as given qualities of the judgment, partly as representing differences in the conditions of knowledge, partly as referring to differences of subjective apprehension.

The essence of the judgment as the apprehension of truth or falsehood consists in its twofold aspect as affirmative and negative, the former of these in a sense prior and better known, but the latter no less necessary, and both referring to objective relations of things. The affirmative and negative character of judgments, the essential aυτiφaσtς of human thought, is further defined in reference to (a) the quantitative distinctions already recognized (the doctrine of logical opposition), (δ) the distinctions of necessary, contingent, and possible, which are rightly regarded as real matters about which the assertion is,^[34. On this account the modality is affirmed not to attach to the copula; thus the opposite of “it is necessary-to-be” is “it is not necessary-to-be,” and not either “it is necessary-not-to-be,” or “it is not-necessary-to-be.” ] and (c), consequent on this, the opposition of modal judgments.^[35. There are obscurities in Aristotle’s doctrine of modals, which remain even after Prantl's laborious treatment (Ges. d. Logik, i. 104-82). A careful survey is given in Rondelet, Théorie logique des propositions modales, 1861. The definitions of ivSeχoμevov and δυνατόν, which have given rise to much diversity of opinion (cf. Prantl, i. 167 sq., as against waitz, i. 376, and Bonitz, p. 387), are excellently dealt with by Ueberweg, Logik, § 69. ]

Propositions as integral parts of knowledge turn upon the ultimate relations of things known. The distinctions between first principles and deduced truths, out of which the theory of proof is developed, themselves rest upon those distinctions which have been already noted in treating of apodictic. Syllogism as the form by which the general and particular elements are mediated and conjoined is therefore of universal application, and may be analysed formally.^[36. In this sense only can we recognize the distinction between Aristotle's Technik and his idea of Apodiktik on which Lange (Logische Studien, 1880) has laid so much stress, what underlies Aristotle's treatment must never be thrown out of account. ] The various modes in which syllogistic inference, pure or modal, the main types to which these modes may be reduced, their relations to one another, and the general laws implied in them are worked out in a fashion which does not admit of any brief statement. The conclusion unites the elements which in isolation appear in the premisses, and is, in a sense, the complex or organic whole unfolded in the syllogistic form. To every syllogism three things are necessary, the presence of a positive element, universality in one of the premisses (resting, as above shown, on the recognized property of all proof as involving a general fact), and consequence, or necessary connexion between conclusion and premisses. Now from this third element there follow certain interesting deductions. The necessity of consequence rests on the very nature of syllogistic thought, and if each syllogism be taken as it stands, as a simple unit, no further inquiry is needful. But the character of the premisses in themselves may be taken into account, and we then discover that syllogism proceeds continuously on the assumption that the general law of syllogistic proof is in the special case realized. It need not be in fact realized. We may have premisses in themselves false, from which a tnιe conclusion is reached, and the falsity of the premisses only becomes apparent when they are themselves treated as conclusions of a possible syllogism, and so the regress made towards ultimate principles. Syllogistic form, in short, is the hypothetical application of the general rule of necessary connexion between ground and consequent. If A (the premisses), then B (the conclusion). Quite possibly, then, we may have, in syllogistic form, conclusions drawn from premisses not αναγκαία but only <υs e ’ πl τδ πολύ. Science and opinion {δόξα) are equally sources of propositions or premisses. If formal consequences be united with real uncertainty of matter, there arises a syllogism in character dialectical. Were the real uncertainty overlooked, the syllogism would be sophistic in character. Dialectical reasoning, then, dealing with the stage beneath science, may be of service, not only for practice in distinguishing true and false, but as bringing the particulars of each branch of knowledge into closer relation with the first principles special to that branch.^[37. Topics, i. 2, §§ 3-6. ] For wherever the particular element as such, the transitory and material, is present, there room is left for opinion, and reasoning is possible, not of the particular as such, but in so far as the particular manifests an underlying universal.^[38. On this distinction et. Kampe, Erkenntnisstheorie d. A., pp. 252,253; Heyder, Method, d. A., p. 322. ] The processes of dialectic reasoning thus resemble very closely those modes by which the empirical detail, the region of given fact, is treated, viz., induction, example, use of signs and probable indications. For the universal has always its empirical side, and the complete process of scientific proof is a final result for which the way may be prepared by treatment, according to scientific form, of the empirical fact. There are syllogisms of fact as well as syllogisms of reason or ground, and the reason or ground becomes apparent through knowledge of the fact. Occasionally indeed the fact and ground are so immediately connected that transition from one to the other may be at once effected, but generally this is not the case.

Of these intermediate forms of reasoning, the only one calling for [9:14:789] comment is induction, of the nature of which something has already been said. The obscure chapter in which the formal analysis of induction is undertaken, a chapter which has much exercised the ingenuity of commentators,^[39. Anal. Pr., ii. 23. Cf. Whewe∏. Camb. Phil. Son. Tran«., vol. ix., 1856; Hamilton, Lectures, ii. 358-62; Grote, i. pp. 268-74; Heyder, 216-26; Kampe, 189-92. ] presents difficulties of varied kinds. An opposition is indicated between syllogism and induction, yet induction is treated as a kind of syllogism; that is, freely interpreted, induction is so analysed as to show that in it, also, there is the union of general assumption and particular detail which is characteristic of syllogistic reasoning. Further, Aristotle seems to waver between induction as a kind of inference, through which we arrive at general principles, and as a species of proof, and his teaching is therefore perplexed by the want of some clear statement regarding a difficulty in the theory of induction, which is still far from perfect solution. For, according to Aristotle, induction as such, starting from the particulars of sense, and proceeding by comparison of similar cases and enumeration of all the similarly constituted members, never, even when the enumeration is complete, attains to probative force.^[40. On induction and recognition of similarity, see Topics, i. chap. 18, p. 108b, 7 Sy. ; viii. chap. 1, § 14, and chap. 8, § 1 (in these last similarity is viewed as being wider in scope than the basis of induction). That induction 'implies a complete enumeration, see Anal. Pr., ii. chaps. 23, 24: Anal. Post., ii. chap. 7, § 1. That induction even when complete is not demonst∣ative, see Anal. Post., i. chap. 5. ] It is still a syllogism of fact, not of ground or reason; there is a distinction of kind between the survey of empirical detail, even when complete, and the assertion of causal connexion between the characteristics of the class and its deduced properties.^[41. On this distinction see mainly Anal. Post., ii. 13, where a very fine description of deductive and inductive proof occurs. ] Thus, perception of the law (τδ καθόλου) from induction is a kind of new element in the process; it is recognition by means of the empirico-critical survey which is the essence of induction.^[42. ♦ Compare the passages above noted, and see the curious expression used in the discussion regarding the relation of universal and particular in Anal. Pr., ii. 21, p. 67a, 22 sq. ] Induction makes clear only, and does not prove.^[43. -) na ^∙ Post., ii. 5, p. 91b, 33, ούδί γάρ ö iιtiγav ίσων aιroteiκwσιv , <xλλ' όμως δηλοί τι. ] If we interpret according to more modern phraseology, this peculiarity may be expressed as the distinctive feature of inductive research based on facts or effects. We do’not regard the inquiry as terminating in the establishment of a law until it is possible to reverse the process and show that from the surmised cause the effects do actually follow. Otherwise we have a conclusion of “coexistence” merely—an empirical rule or generalization. If, bearing in mind these sources of difficulty, and also the correlation which for Aristotle always obtains between empirical details and grounds of reason, we consider the example given in the obscure chapter before us, some light may be cast on the exposition there given. The example selected is one touched upon by Aristotle in other two passages, in the treatise De Partibus Animalium, and in the Post. Anal., ii. 18.^[44. De Part. Anim., iv. 2. CB Hamilton, Led., iv. p. 358, n. On Anal. Post., ii. 16-18, see the valuable summary by Grote, i. pp. 366-68. ] As regards the first of these, reference is desirable only to bring out the fact that causal nexus is the καθόλου in question; the second is of the utmost importance as clearing up what has always seemed an obscurity in the account of the inductive syllogism. Iu the chapters 16-18 of Anal. Post., ii., Aristotle considers the relation of cause and effect as the essential basis of proof, and he points out with much clearness the difference between the fact as cause of knowledge and the cause as ground of existence and proof. In some cases cause and effect are so united, so reciprocate, that we may infer from one to the other. But the doubt arises, may there not be more than one cause for any given attribute, iu which case all such inferences from effect must become problematical. Aristotle’s solution is remarkable, both in itself and in its bearing on the inductive syllogism. Suppose the attribute 3 is found in all individuals of a class A, and also in individuals of class B, C, &c. Iu order to discover the cause, investigations must be carried on until we have a defined number of classes A,B,C, &c., in all of which β is found, and which comprehend all cases of the presence of β. Then that which is also common to A,B,C, &c., may be regarded as the cause of β, say, e.g., an attribute a. If this attribute a be really the cause of β, it will enter into its definition; it will be its definition. There might, however, be a connexion of a and β of this universal and reciprocating kind, and yet a might not be the cause in question; it might be only a fact from which β could be inferred; the real cause y, which gives rise to α, lies in the background. Characteristic of causation, then, is constant reciprocal conjunction of facts. Even if it be admitted, then, that there may be more causes for a phenomenon than one, it will yet be true that each of these causes will be manifested in one class of phenomena where there will be the universal reciprocating coexistence that is characteristic of the relation in question. Thus the attribute longevity observable in quadruped animals and in birds may be due to different causes, c.g., to absence of gall in the one case, to predominance of solid, dry matter in the other. But in each case there will be a definite species characterized by the constant conjunction of the cause and the causatum; the whole class long-lived animals and the class gall-less animals will coincide.

Turning now to the chapter on inductive syllogism, we find induction defined as inference through the minor that the major belongs to the middle. Here evidently major and middle are regarded not as determined by form only but naturally distinct, and we must assume that by middle term is to be understood the ground or reason of the attribute (major term) characteristic of a defined species or group (the middle term). Were our knowledge complete and scientific, we should be able to express this in apodιi - tic form :—whatever animal has no gall is long-lived; man, horse, mule, &c., are animals having no gall; therefore they are long-lived. The progress of knowledge, however, may be from the empirical details. We may have given to us the fact of the attribute, long-livedness, in the group of animals, man, horse, <fec., and discover that these long-lived animals are also wanting in gall. If then, in accordance with the rules above sketched, there can be discovered a reciprocating relation between want of gall in animals and long-livedness, if we can constitute a class distinguished by conjoint presence of gall-lessness and longevity, we have the basis for an inductive proof. We may infer therefrom that gall-lessness is, in this species, the cause of longevity. Such a reasoning is founded on particulars given, and as the coexistence is given, the conclusion seems to be immediately drawn; there does not appear to be mediation or use of a middle term; nevertheless the middle term is implied, not in the supposition that the two classes reciprocate, but in the transference from empirical coexistence to causal nexus.

Aristotle’s mode of stating this argument has presented so many difficulties of interpretation that various emendations have been proposed. Grote, e.g., who has not apprehended why the class longlived animals should be taken universally,—“we are,”he says, “in no way concerned with the totality of long-lived animals,”—suggests an emendation, which makes the essence of the inductive reasoning turn upon the extension of what we know regarding some gall-less animals to all of that class. But this is not the inductive step according to Aristotle. Induction has not to prove or assume that a and β, found coexisting in some members of a species, coexist in all of them; Aristotle takes this universal coexistence for granted as the basis of the argument. The inductive step is the transference from this universal coexistence to causal nexus. Apodictically, we should say, if α is the cause of β, then all A which possesses a possesses β; thus reasoning from cause to causatum. Inductively we say, all A which possesses a has β ; therefore a is the cause of j3.^[45. The following is the relative portion of chap. 23 of bk. ii. of the A nal. Pr.∙.— " Now induction and syllogism through induction is the process of concluding by means of the minor term that the major term is predicable of the middle " (that is to say, of concluding from given facts that an attribute found in all of them is the effect of some other attribute also found in all of them). “For example, if B be the middle term, A and C the extremes, we show, by means of C, that A is predicable of B; for this is the inductive process. Thus,’ let A be longlived; B, those wanting gall; C, individual long-lived, as man. horse, mule. Then A is predicated universally of C” (that is to say, the attribute A is found in all the examples before us), “for also that which wants gall is long-lived " (that is to say, as a given fact, gall-lessness and longevity in the species, group, before us coexist). “B, wanting gall, thus is predicated universally of C. If then B and C be reciprocating, if C do not extend beyond the middle term ’ ' (that is, if we do not find other animals than the long-lived animals enumerated which also are devoid of gall), "it is necessary that A should be predicated of B. For it has been shown previously that if two terms are predicable of the same third, and if the extreme reciprocate with one of these, then the other of those predicates will be predicable of that with which the first reciprocated; but it is necessaιy to know that C is the complex of all the individual cases.” The last sentence is extremely hard to interpret. The expression το άκρον occurring in it is generally the technical word for major term, but as in the syllogism before us the major term is one of the predicates, this signification would seem to contradict the words wpôç θάτιρον αυτών. Hamilton reads τδ μiσoυ, which makes the argument intelligible and coherent with the passage apparently referred to in δeδeικται πpoτepov, viz., Anal. Pr.. ii. 21, p. 68a, 21-25. Probably Aristotle uses τ<> άκρου here as equivalent to C. the άκρου through which the induction proceeds. According to the view taken above, the essence of the Aristotelian induction does not at all lie in the universalizing of C, but in connecting in one proposition the attributes B and A found to coexist in the group C. There is thus in one sense no middle, for cause is not reached; in another sense there is, for C is the material link connecting A and B. Aristotle then might naturally use άκρου for C. and assimilate the procιss of induction to a syllogism in which there was reciprocation of terms. In fact, however, induction regarded after his fashion results merely in the constitution of_a group or class characterized as possessing two attributes in common. ]

Induction, as dealing with particulars, starting with the sense data, and resting upon the more evident fact in order to point towards the essential ground or reason, is therefore more persuasive, more palpable, more adapted for popular inquiries, and relatively more apparent. Syllogistic proof, on the other hand, is more stringent, and more efficacious in establishing a scientific conclusion or position.

Aristotle’s mode of dealing with induction, in so far at least as any specific process is designated by that term, seems on the surface to diverge widely from modern logical theory, and we look in vain in his analytical researches for consideration of the methods of observation and experiment which has come to be recognized as the essential portion of a doctrine of inductive reasoning. Y et it may fairly be argued that in modern theories the term induction is used with great laxity, so as to cover either all processes connected with scientific method or some one special feature of scientific reasoning, and that the difference between the Aristotelian and modern views [9:14:790] lies mainly in the matter, not in the form, of the process. For there are numerous hints in Aristotle respecting scientific procedure,^[46. See, for example, the discussions in Topics, i. 17-18; ii. 10-11, on similarity · in the Post. Anal., i. 13, on deductive and inductive methods; in Post. Anal:, ii. 13, on the formation of definition; and in Post. Anal., ii. 12, 14-18, on the relation of cause and effect. ] and, if we consider what is peculiar to modern views, we shall find that it consists mainly in the increased fulness and complexity of our fundamental scientific notions, a fulness and complexity resulting from long-continued scientific research. Our modern logic of induction has profited mainly by the general advance of scientific method, and tends to increase as these methods, by constant contact with facts, become more refined and accurate. The additional cautions or limitations which we now introduce into our statement of the principles of inductive research concern not so much the form of inductive proof as the character and modes of obtaining evidence which is to satisfy the canons or rules of proof. Such limitations become apparent only through actual scientific progress, not by analysis of the form of scientific proof.

18. To Aristotle, as has been above said, proof is essentially syllogistic or deductive in character. Not every syllogism is an apodictic proof, but all proof is syllogistic. For proof or adequate knowledge is reference of effects to their causes, and the cause is the general element, τb καθόλου, which forms the middle term in apodictic proof. Now proof by means of the cause or reason implies the existence of the cause; the inquiry why a thing is is useless unless we know or assume that the thing is. If it exists, then the cause or reason of its so existing is that which gives it a definite character or position; it is, in technical phraseology, the form of the thing. But the form of the thing, regarded apart from the material, accidental element essential to its concrete existence, is that which we express in a definition. Proof and definition are thus most closely connected. The terminus to which proof tends, not realized in all cases of proof but certainly in the most perfect, is the definition, and, besides, if we closely examine proof, and find that ultimately we can force back the chain of middle terms up to certain ultimate, primary universals, disclosed by vous, and that the nature of these primary universals is stated in their definition, we see further that definition is connected with proof as the terminιιs from which proof starts. The exposition of definition is thus the crowning portion of Aristotle’s theory of apodictic method.^[47. It does not seem necessary here to consider in detail the peculiarities of apodictic as these are laid out in the first book of the Post. Anal., nor to deal with the doubts raised regarding definition and proof in the first chapters of the second i « ∙.,, "' lle substance of these difficult chapters can be readily summarized. If definition be taken as a finished result, it seems to stand in no relation to proof, and indeed it is hard to discover how it comes about at all. For definition supposes that which is implied in proof, the existence of the thing defined, and. moreover, it is in a special sense a unity, containing no distinction of subject and ^⅛∙θ ate, such distinction is of the very essence of a demonstrated proE° n t !"∙.

Definition, as concerned with that which is involved in demonstration, the ground or reason, is in cases where the reason and consequent are separable the sum of the demonstration; it is the compressed statement of the connexion between a subject and the attribute demonstrated of it, i.e., in a syllogism of the first figure, the major term.^[48. απoδeι⅞ιs θeσeι διαφέρουσα, Anal. Post., i. 8, p. 75b 31 ] Frequently a definition merely states the demonstrated attribute in relation to its subject, without indicating the rational link.^[49. συμπέρασμά τι aπoδe⅛eως, ibid. ] Such definitions, however, are defective, just as the conclusion of a syllogism, if taken per se, is defective.^[50. De ⅛nima, ii. 2, p. 413a, 13 sq. ] ® A genuine definition is the statement of the essence, which in mediated notions is the cause or middle term of the demonstration, in immediate notions is directly assumed.^[51. oδin>v αμέσων bpισμbs θeσιs έστί του τi ίστιν αvαπ<5δeικτos. ] A merely nominal definition or explanation of what a name signifies is but a preparatory stadium in the progress towards real, genetic definition.

Definition, then, like demonstration, rests on the essential or rational ground, the notion of the thing. The rational ground or notion has its empirical aspect; it determines a class, and thus, just as in demonstration we may have forms of reasoning based primarily on the empirical details, so in framing definitions we may proceed from the empirical class, and may formulate rules for defining which bear special reference to the genus or body of individuals. In such procedure there is always involved the general idea of the essence or notion as the determining universal, and without this general idea the subsidiary methods, induction and division, do not yield scientific definition.

To frame a definition, then, t.e., to discover the elements whose combination as an essential unity makes up the notion of the things defined, we select the predicates belonging to the things in question, but also attaching to other species of the same genus. The combination of such predicates which is not found in any other species, which is, therefore, reciprocable with the essence or form of the species, is its definition. The definition, therefore, contains the genus and the specific attribute (or combination of attributes). Of these elements, the genus is the least important; the truly essential factor is the specific difference, and, in order that our definition should be ultimate, we must follow out the line of specific difference by which a genus may be divided until we reach a final, irreducible characteristic or group of characteristics, constituting a lowest species (or natural kind, if one were to employ a term made current by J. S. Mill). The systematic following out of the specific differences is logical division; the critical comparison of points of similarity in species of the same genus, so as to obtain a higher generality, has no special title accorded to it, but it resembles the Socratic and Platonic induction (συναγωγή). Division proceeds on the oppositions actually found in nature; and, though, doubtless, the division by dichotomy has formal advantages, it has not, as a process of real cognition, any supreme value. The negative as such is the inconceivable, and presents nothing for cognition.^[52. Just as the όνομα αόριστου is said to have no significance save as the summary of a proposition, while a negative proposition has significance only in regard to the corresponding positive. ] And division is not dependent on exhaustive knowledge; it is not necessary that, in order to recognize A as distinct from B, we should know the whole universe of possible objects of cognition. A and B may be recognized as identical or distinct in essence, even though they at the same time possess distinct or identical accidental marks. Knowledge, in other words, turns upon the essential, not upon the numerical universal.^[53. The reference is to a theory advanced by Speusippus; see Prantl, i. 85. Aristotle here touches on a logical problem whicn has troubled many logicians. It is the same difficulty that arises when the question of plurality of causes is-considered. ] It is only needful, then, that in the systematic process of indicating the elements of definition, all must be included that concern the essence, that the order must be strictly from determining to determined (or from more abstract or general to more concrete or special), and finally that the enumeration be complete. The final division or species reached is the notion of the thing, and its expression is the definition.

19. The analytical researches thus manifest themselves as a real theory of knowledge and as forming an integral part of the Aristotelian system. Logical relations are throughout conditioned by the characteristics of the Aristotelian metaphysical conception, and the distinction of the formal or technical from the real in cognition has no place in them. No point is more frequently insisted on by Aristotle than the impossibility of deducing any scientific principles or results from the fundamental axiom of thought, the law of non-contradiction. In the Aristotelian system this axiom appears simply as the generalized expression for the peculiar characteristic of thought, its potentiality of truth or falsehood. Such potentiality accompanies thought throughout, and is the mark of its subjective character, but the actuality of thought is something quite distinct, and is only realized through the various processes whereby the world of fact is apprehended. Beyond a doubt knowledge has a general aspect; and there is thus possible a general theory of knowledge, but this is not to be regarded as merely a development from the fundamental axiom of thought. It is the general statement of what constitutes actual cognition, and thus refers on the one hand to the ultimate properties of that which is to be known, on the other hand to the qualities of knowledge as a subjective, though not the less real, fact. ' For to Aristotle subjective has not the sense which it may be said to have assumed in modern logic, mainly through the Kantian analysis. The activity of thought which realizes itself in the consciousness of the individual is not a mere formal process of apprehension, mirroring or depicting reality that is totally distinct from it. It is a reality, one aspect or phase of the total sum of things, and its development is a real proces» correlative with the development inherent in things as a whole.

At the same time it is impossible to overlook the difficulties which attach to the Aristotelian conception, and the consequent obscurities or perplexities in his logical researches. To remain always true to the fundamental conception of thought as one factor or phase in things, to trace its forms in such a mode, as never to lose sight of its essential correlation to the development of reality, is in itself the hardest task for any thinker, and presupposes a more completed metaphysic than is to be found in Aristotle. Some of these difficulties may be briefly noted, as they form the turning points of certain later doctrines. The judgment or proposition is taken as the initial, the simplest phase of the activity of thought, and so as having the simplest relation to things. But the distinctions of things which are subjectively seized.in the judgment are too much regarded as given facts, and Aristotle is thus involved in a difficulty respecting the import, the truth or falsity, of the judgment. The presence of this difficulty is specially discernible when he attempts to deal with the temporal reference in the judgment, with the doctrine of opposition, and with the nature of modality. Thus, he notes that the verb, the essential part of the predicate, has a [9:14:791] temporal significance, but he also notes that in universal judgments there is no reference to any specific time, and also that the copula, the verb is, has no existential meaning. He is thus driven to the enunciation of a view, common among recent logicians, that the judgment is a reflective or critical act, pronouncing on the truth or falsity of a contemplated separation or conjunction of facts, while, on the other hand, the very contemplation of conjunction or separation has appeared as the essence of the judgment. So, in dealing with opposition, he distinguishes contradictories from contraries, and is inclined to refer the second to the given nature of facts, wherein extreme oppositions of members falling under the same genus are presented. Modality, likewise, he treats confusedly, for the assignment of the modal relations to the predicate does not sufficiently determine their place in a theory of judgment, nor explain the relation in which they stand to the judgment as the simplest activity of thought.

Further, in dealing with the quantity of judgments, Aristotle is perplexed by his own theory of what constitutes generality. He is compelled to throw together universal judgments of a totally distinct kind,—empirical and rational, as one may call them,—and though the underlying view that empirical universality is the expression of, and is dependent on, rational connexion is made sufficiently clear in the doctrine of proof, it is not carried out to its consequences in the doctrine of judgment. Finally, to note only the crowning difficulty, the theory of proof and of definition turns upon the nature of the essential connexion of attributes in a subject, but the explanation of essence is precisely the lacuna in the system. Indications of a theory of essence are not wanting, but it does not seem possible so to unite them as to form a consistent whole. The greatest obscurity still hangs over the fundamental part of the system, the nature of the τrpωτα which are apprehended by rovs, of the specific relation of attributes καθ’ aura to their subjects, and of the ϊδιαι apχal from which particular sciences start. That the πρ6τa<rιis 6μeσoι, so frequently adduced as integral parts of proof, are analytical judgments^[54. As Ze∏er will have It; see Ph. d. Gr., il. 2,191, n. Doubtless Aristotle does define an essential attribute as being one contained in the subject or one of which the subject notion is an integral part, but this relation of entering into the definition is not to be identified rashly with the modern view of the analytical relation of subject and predicate. ] cannot be accepted without such qualifications as to render the use of such a term misleading; but what their precise nature is remains in the Aristotelian system undetermined.

Logic from, Aristotle to Bacon and Descartes.

20. The long history of philosophic thought from Aristotle to the beginning of the modern period furnishes no new conception of logic so complete and methodical as to require detailed treatment, but exhibits alterations in special doctrines, additions, and new points of view numerous enough to account for a certain radical change in the mode of regarding logic which is, for our present purpose, the only interesting feature. This change may perhaps be expressed not inaccurately as the tendency towards formalizing logic. Gradually logical researches came to have their boundaries extended in one way by the introduction of new matter, and narrowed in another by restriction of logical consideration to one special aspect of knowledge. Much in the history of this movement still remains in obscurity, but the general result is sufficiently clear. The periods into which the historical development of logic throughout this long interval may be naturally divided, with their main characteristics, are the following.! (1) The Peripatetic School, represented by Theophrastus and Eudernus, following in the main the Aristotelian tradition, but deviating in certain fundamental respects, and on the whole treating the matter of logical research as though it were separate from and independent of the theory of knowledge as a whole. To this school is due the distinct recognition of the hypothetical and disjunctive proposition and syllogism, and the more complete enumeration of the possible valid modes of categorical reasoning. In both cases the additions are made to turn upon purely formal considerations. The hypothetical and disjunctive judgments are treated as given varieties, to be discerned in ordinary language and expression, not as resting upon any fundamentally distinct principle or activity of thought.^[55. The nature of hypothetical inference and its law are recognized with the greatest distinctness by Aristotle. From his theory of essence as causal nexus, any distinction of kind between an apodictlc (categorical) syllogism and a hypothetical of the type contemplated by later logicians was impossible and needless. ] The addition of five indirect moods to those recognized by Aristotle as belonging to the first figure proceeds on the purely formal ground of difference in position of the middle term in the two premisses. (2) The Epicurean and Stoic Logics. Of these the Epicurean presents no points of interest. The Stoic logic, on the other hand, is the first example of a purely formal doctrine based on and associated with a thoroughly empirical theory of cognition. In essence the Stoic doctrine is identical with that of Antisthenes, above noted, and it is interesting to observe that, under the purely nominalist theory, logic becomes almost identical with the doctrine of expression, or rhetoric. The theory of naming, and that of the conjunction of names in propositions, are the fundamental portions of the body of logic. Naturally the Stoic logicians tended to increase the bulk of logic by introducing numerous distinctions of language, and by signalizing varieties of judgment dependent on varieties of verbal expression. (3) The acceptation of Logic among the Romans. Here there must be distinguished the quasi-rhetorical logic, such as is found in Cicero, which is altogether Stoic in character, and the Aristotelian logic, as developed by Boetius with the additions of the later commentators. In Boetius one notes specially the technical or formal character of the treatment, which was of special importance historically, from the fact that the earlier scholastic writers derived their main knowledge of logic from certain of the treatises of Boetius. (4) The Scholastic Logic. On the details of the scholastic logic it is not necessary to enter, but there must be noted the following points as of interest in determining what may well be called the current conception of the Aristotelian logic in modern times. The earlier scholastics, in possession of but few of Aristotle’s writings, added nothing of importance to the body of logical researches, and the permanent subject of discussion, the nature of universals, did not, through any of its solutions, affect the treatment of logical doctrines. The introduction of the body of the Aristotelian writings was contemporaneous with the introduction of the Arab writings and commentaries into western Europe, and there grew up therewith a more developed treatment of what may be called the psychological element of logic. The logic of the later scholastics is characterized by two points of interest, historically unconnected, but having a natural affinity,—the one, the introduction of an immense mass of subtle distinctions, mainly verbal, making up the body of the Parva Logicalia, the other, the influence of the nominalist conception of thought.^[56. The first of these is no doubt, as Prantl has laboured to prove, Byzantine in origin, but it still remains doubtful whence the Eastern logicians draw. The most probable source is the Stoic writings. ] The peculiarity of the nominalist view is the severance of immediate apprehension from discursive thought, the assignment of all matter of knowledge to the one, and of all form to the other. But form, under this conception of discursive thought, can be found only in the generalizing function of signs or names; accordingly the fundamental processes of logical thought are regarded as so many modes of application of names. The later nominalist logicians were thus naturally led to the expenditure of immense subtlety and diligence on the thorny problems of the Parva Logicalia, while at the same time the peculiar inner difficulty of the theory became apparent as its consequences were worked out. (5) The Reaction against Aristotelianisrn and the Humanist Modification of Logic. Little of positive value for logical theory is offered by the numerous works representing this stage of historical development. Valla, Agricola, and Vives, with much good criticism in general spirit and detail, present a rhetorico-grammatical logic that resembles most closely Cicero’s eclectic reproduction of Stoicism. Ramus, the only logician of the period with historic renown, contributes really nothing to the history of logic, his innovations consisting mainly in the omission of the most valuable portions of the genuine Aristotelic logic, the insertion of practical and interesting examples, and finally rearrangement or redistribution of the heads under which logical doctrine was expounded. The Ramist school, most numerous and flourishing, produced no logical work of the first importance.·^[57. See note C, p. 803. ]

The net result of this whole period was the severance of a certain body of doctrine, formal in character (the theory of second intentions), from theory of knowledge generally, and from all the concrete sciences. The boundaries and even the functions of this doctrine remained unfixed, for difference regarding fundamental points of extra-logical theory led to difference in mode of treatment, as well as to difference in conceptions of the end and value of logic.

Logic of Bacon and Descartes.

21. Modern reform of logic, by which may be understood the attempt to place logical theory in a more close and living relation to actual scientific method, begins with Bacon and Descartes. To both the scholastic logic presented itself as the essence of a thoroughly false and futile method of knowledge. Neither had the acquaintance with the genuine Aristotelian system requisite in order to distinguish the elements of permanent value from the worthless accretions under which these had been buried, and, as a natural consequence, the views of both have a far closer resemblance to the Aristotelian doctrine than might be imagined from the attitude of opposition common to them. Both thinkers were animated by the spirit of reformation in science, and both emphasize the practical end of all speculation. For both, therefore, logic, which to neither is of high value, appeared to be a species of practical science, a generalized statement of the mode in which intellect acquires new knowledge, in which the mind proceeds from known to unknown.^[58. Comp. Princiρ. Phil., Pref.; De Aug. Sc., bk. v. chap. 1, 2. ] But such a conception of logic is, if the expression be permitted, formal; that is to say, the actual province of logic is not determined thereby, but awaits determination from [9:14:792] the further idea of the nature of knowledge and the ultimate constitution of that which is to be known. When this point is reached, a radical divergence presents itself between the views of Descartes and Bacon, consequent on which appears a radically divergent statement of the main processes and methods of logical theory.

To Descartes the ideal of cognition is the mathematical, that in which from assured and distinct data we proceed by strict sequence of proof to determine accurately and completely the nature of complex phenomena. Such an ideal, extended so as to embrace knowledge as a whole, dominates the whole of the Cartesian speculation, and, as in the case of the Socratic doctrine of knowledge, is the ground of the Cartesian doubt. Perfect certainty, i.e., clearness and distinctness of principles, logical consecutiyeness of deduction from them, and exhaustive enumeration of details—such are the characteristics of completed knowledge. There follow naturally therefrom the main processes of knowledge intuition, by which the simple data and axioms are apprehended; induction, or exhaustive enumeration of the elementary factors of any phenomenon; deduction, or determination of the complex as the necessary result of the combination of simple factors. To the processes of induction and deduction, when viewed more generally, the titles analysis and synthesis may be given.^[59. ⅛S' enti ∙ n ° s ∙>< and especially 7. The celebrated p·ocesses SPeCU ' atl0n iie o i odo) are only a more popular statement of the same ] On other portions of logical theory Descartes does not enter, and the text-books of the Cartesian school, even the celebrated Port Royal logic, do little more than expound with some freshness such of the older material as seemed capable of harmonizing with the new conception.

Two things only require note in respect to the Cartesian logic, apart from its freshness and completeness; the one is the obscurity which hangs over the nature of intuition; the other is the step in advance of the scholastic logic effected in the assimilation of deduction to synthesis. As regards the first, the criteria laid down by Descartes, viz., clearness and distinctness, are unsatisfactory and ambiguous. It is evident that he implied under these clear and distinct recognition of necessity in the data or principles, but the nature of this necessity is never made clear.^[60. His ultimate standard is, no doubt, necessity for a thinking subject, whatever is so connected with the existence of the thinking being that without it this existence is incomprehensible is necessary. But to apply this ideal to any pro-Ç~'," »aye the first, the Cogιto ergo sum, is for Descartes the fundamental difficulty of his philosophy. ] As regards the second, it was of importance to signalize, as against the scholastic view, that the universal in thought or reasoning was not only of the nature of the class notion, that genera and species were not the ultimate universals, but were themselves secondary products, formed by reasoning, and based upon essential connexion of facts. In this Descartes was but returning to the genuine Aristotelian doctrine, but his view has all the advantage derived from a truer and more scientific conception of what these connexions in nature really are.

22. What is peculiar in the logic of Bacon springs likewise from the peculiarities of the underlying conception of nature. The inductive method, expounded in the Novum Organum, is, however, only part of the Baconian logic, and, since it is commonly regarded as being the whole, a brief statement of what Bacon included under logic may here be given.

Viewing logic as the doctrine which deals with the use and object of the intellectual faculties, Bacon divides it (in this approximating somewhat to the extended division of the Stoic logicians) into (1) the art of inquiry or invention, (2) the art of examination or judgment, (3) the art of memory, and (4) the art of elocution or tradition. The third and fourth divisions are unimportant; the first and second might be called respectively the theory of the acquisition of knowledge and the theory of evidence or proof. The art of inquiry is subdivided into the art of the discovery of arts and the art of the discovery of arguments. The second of these Bacon regards as identical with the Topics of the Greek and Roman dialectic, and therefore as of comparatively slight value. Of the first there are two main branches :—(A) Experientia Literata and (B) Interpretatio Naturae. The art of judgment has two subdivisions :—the examination of methods of reasoning—induction and syllogism—which resembles the older analytic; and the examination of errors of reasoning—whether these be sophistical, i.e., the logical fallacies of the older doctrine, or errors of interpretation to be removed by careful criticism of scientific terms, or arising from erroneous tendences of the mind (the doctrine of idola) —which resembles the older treatment of Elenchi.

The peculiarity of the Baconian logic, then, must be sought in the processes included under the art of discovering arts or knowledge. Among these the syllogism is not included. It is a process with no practical utility; it involves premisses of which the truth is simply assumed, and consequently its conclusions can have no validity beyond that of the premisses; it affects to determine the particular from the general, but in fact nature is much more subtle than intellect, and our generalizations, which are but partial abstractions, are quite inadequate to afford exhaustive knowledge of the particular; it throws no light upon the essential part of cognition as a process in formation, viz., the method by which we are to obtain accurate notions of things, and judgments based on these notions. Moreover, the deductive or syllogistic procedure favours and encourages the tendency to rash generalization, to the formulation of a universal axiom from few particulars, and to the uncritical acceptance of experience. If syllogism exist at all, there must be a prior process, that of generalizing by rigid and accurate methods from experience itself. Syllogism is not entirely worthless. It is of particular service in some branches of science {e.g., the mathematical), and generally may be employed so soon as the principles of a science are well established; but it is a subordinate and secondary method.

The art of discovery, then, is the method of generalizing from experience. What this method shall be depends entirely on the thinker’s conception of experience. Now Bacon’s conception is perfectly definite. Observation presents to us complex natures which are the results of simpler, more general forms or causes. From the complex phenomena these forms are to be sifted out by a methodical process of analysis and experiment. A general proposition is one stating the connexion between complex natures and their simple forms or causes; it is, therefore, the result of a graduated process. No doubt there may be generalizations based only on an ingenious comparison of the complex phenomena as they are presented to us; such a process Bacon calls Experientia Literata, and the maxims recommended for it much resemble the ordinary methods of experiment, but truly scientific knowledge is only to be obtained by the complete inductive method. The characteristics of this inductive method follow at once from the nature of the object in view. The form which is sought can be detected only by examination of cases in which the given complex effect is present, in which it is absent, and in which it appeal's in different degrees or amounts. By a critical comparison of these cases we may be able to detect, and, were the enumeration exhaustive, we must infallibly detect, by process of exclusion or elimination, a phenomenon constantly present when the effect is present, absent whenever the effect is absent, and varying in degree with the effect. Such a phenomenon would be the form in question,—the cause of the given fact or attribute. Exhaustive enumeration is, of course, an ideal, and therefore the method of exclusion can never be perfectly carried out, but all additional aids have significance only as supplying in part the place of exhaustive enumeration. We may, on the basis of a wide examination, frame a first generalization (first vintage as Bacon metaphorically calls it), and proceed to test its correctness by carrying out the critical comparison with it in view. Or we may, under the guidance of our leading principle, take advantage of certain typical cases presented by nature, or force cases by experiment in such a way as to supersede the enumeration. There are prerogative instances, critical phenomena, helpful in discovery of the cause of a phenomenon. Of other adminicula, or aids to induction, only the titles are given by Bacon, and it would be hazardous to conjecture as to their significance.^[61. Nov. Οrg.. ii. 21. In addition to prerogative instances there are mentioned —supports of induction; rectification of induction; variation of the investigation according to the nature of the subject; prerogative natures; limits of investigation; application to practice; preparations for investigation; ascending and descending scale of axioms. ]

The Baconian logic, then, or at least what is peculiar to it, is thoroughly conditioned by the peculiarities of the Baconian metaphysic or conception of nature and natural processes. As to the novelty of the logic, this to us does not appear to lie in the mere fact that stress is laid upon induction, nor do we think it correct to assign to Bacon the introduction of the theory of induction as an integral portion of logic. But it consists in the new view taken of rvhat constitutes the universal in thought, a view which may be inadequate, but which colours and affects every process of thought, and therefore every portion of logical theory. It is but a consequence of Bacon’s narrow view of the essence of syllogism that he should set induction in opposition to deduction, and regard syllogism as of service only for communication of knowledge. His inductive methods are throughout syllogistic in this respect, that they like all processes of thought involve the combination of universal and particular. Experience is interpreted, that is to say, viewed under the light of a general idea or notion.

Logic on the Basis of Psychological Empiricism. Locke, Hume, Mill, Condillac.

23. The universal element in thought which is recognized by Bacon as present received from him no special treatment. His theory of the nature of knowledge offered no explanation of the origin, significance, and validity of the notions involved in inductive procedure. The Essay on the Human Understanding, which carries out in the domain of inner experience the practical tendency of the Baconian method, supplied from the point of view of individualism the metaphysical theory common to both, a certain psychological theory of the universal element in knowledge, and thereby afforded a new foundation for logical doctrines. The Essay contains, in an unsystematic fashion, much that bears directly on logic (e.g., the whole discussion on names, the classification of the signification of [9:14:793] judgments, the criticism of syllogistic argument), but of more importance than these detached and direct portions is the general principle which underlies the whole view of human knowledge. This principle is briefly that of psychological genesis. All the complex tacts of knowledge are regarded as mechanical compounds due to the coherence of simple data, the facts of inner and outer sense. The method of Locke is that which underlies and determines all the logical work of one very important school of logicians.

It is not needful to enter into details of Locke’s own contributions to the foundation of logic. But it may be pointed out that from his position there were two possible lines of development. In his view the primitive impressions, the facts of inner and outer sense, were in themselves primitive facts of cognition; they were cognitions (it is the very essence of Locke’s method to identify a simple impression of sense with the knowledge of a simple sense fact). The processes of abstraction, comparison, f.e., judging and reasoning, were exercised upon their data, and these products were, in consequence, of a secondary and, so to speak, artificial character. It was natural that a thinker who identified impression of sense with knowledge of a sense fact should maintain that the secondary formations of thought (general ideas, general propositions, syllogism) were not indispensable for cognition; that we could and did reason from particulars to particulars. At the same time Locke admitted the secondary processes as having actual existence, and in one important case (that of the judgment of coexistence, with which may be taken the idea of substance and of real relation) seemed to allow that in judgment something was added to the primitive data. It was possible, then, for development from Locke’s position to proceed either by offering an explanation of the added elements, which should be in stricter harmony with the fundamental doctrine of psychological genesis, or by throwing them entirely out of account ana concentrating attention on the primitive data as the only materials of cognition. The first is the line taken by Hume, which finds its logical completion in Mill; the second is the line taken by Condillac.

Hume has an easy task so long as he merely subjects Locke’s position to negative criticism; for the added elements, the ideas of substance, relation, cause, &c., are clearly inept and defenceless when the facts to be linked by them are already contemplated as so many completed, isolated cognitions. But where connectedness of cognition is in question, and where some explanation is demanded of the relations which seem to supply the universal rule in thinking, Hume’s task is not so simple, and his final answer that these relations are psychological growths or products of association is neither satisfactory in itself nor quite in keeping with other portions of his doctrine. In Hume, however, we find the first thoroughgoing attempt to construct a theory of knowledge on the basis of psychological empiricism or individualism, and the first contributions to a doctrine of inductive proof as portion of this more comprehensive theory. Briefly, so far as logic is concerned, Hume offers as explanation of the universal in thought association of ideas, but does not treat of logic specially or in detail.

The complete statement of the theory of knowledge from the psychological point of view is that contained in Mill’s System of Logic.

The aim of that work is the exposition of the theory of knowledge. Now knowledge, the term being taken in a wide sense, is characterized by one quality mainly, viz., evidentiary force. For every item entering into the sum of our beliefs at any moment, immediate perception being discounted, there may be reasons advanced, adequate or inadequate. The exposition of the relations between beliefs and their evidence or ground is logic, and logic is thus in one sense formal, inasmuch as the relations of evidence and belief are general, not dependent on the special nature of the facts believed, and in another sense real, in that knowledge is conceivable only in strictest relation to the things known.

Now, the exposition of the general nature of grounds of belief is in fact identical with a theory of the universal element in thought or cognition, and this theory is the essential portion of Mill’s logic. It being assumed that the facts with which knowledge is concerned are minds, bodies, states of consciousness, and the relations (coexistence, sequence, similarity) among these states, and that propositions express, therefore, existence, coexistence, sequence, or resemblance, on what is based any inference going beyond a present perception? The propositions which make up cognition, strictly so calleα, are not mere expressions of momentary states; they are expressions of belief regarding the more or less constant relations of facts. They are, in fact, conclusions. The theory of proposition and of reasoning is one. On what, then, do such conclusions rest?

The warrant for any conclusion based upon experience, and referring to experience itself, can be found only in experience or in some principle furnished by experience. It may be shown that evidence for a conclusion is adequate, if we can compare this evidence with the kind of evidence on which a wider conclusion, frequently or constantly verified, rests. This comparison of particular evidence with more general evidence is the preliminary answer furnished by Mill. But what is the general evidence referred to, and what is the principle founded on it? The general evidence is the repeated experience of constancy of connexion among groups of phenomena, and the principle founded on it is that of the existence of uniformity or rather of uniformities in nature. The evidence and the principle are purely psychological in character; that is to say, repeated experience, beginning with familiar cases and extending itself as time goes on, produces, by the natural laws of association, an assured belief that phenomena as a whole, or at least in the main, are connected together in constant, uniform, invariable modes. Such a belief, once established, serves as an ultimate criterion of proof, and as an index for research. We proceed in our investigations in the light of this principle, and the tests by which we estimate the validity of evidence for any particular inference as to uniformity are generalized statements deducible from it. So soon as our evidence is of such a character that, in the case before us, either the inference of uniformity is warranted or the general principle must be held not to apply to this particular case, we have proof as cogent as experience can afford.

The universal in knowledge, then, is this naturally formed assumption regarding the course of nature. The logic of knowledge is the exposition of the modes in which evidence is obtained, of the tests by which its validity is estimated, and of the forms in which evidence and conclusion are connected.

The characteristic features of the subordinate processes of proof are at once deducible from this fundamental view. For if the simplest form of inference be, psychologically, the transition effected by association from one particular case to another resembling it, and if the essence of proof consist in comparison of the evidence for any one conclusion with the type of evidence for the general assumption regarding nature (or at least a wider portion of nature), it is evident that syllogism, in the ordinary acceptation of the term (in which it implies a concrete general proposition, a particular subsumed thereunder, and a conclusion), is neither a primitive form of inference nor a valid mode of proof. Doubtless we do in reasoning employ general propositions in order to express the determination of some particulars belonging to the same class, but the general proposition is itself a conclusion, resting on evidence of the kind above described, and the essence of syllogistic reasoning is not the subsumption of a particular under a general in which it is included, but the expression of belief that the evidence for the general proposition is adequate to cover all the particular cases, including those which have not been taken into account in formulating it. The major premiss of a syllogism is the record of a previous induction, and the syllogistic process, bringing forward a new case, is a valuable method tor testing the adequacy of the previous generalization. As to generalization itself, the basis is evidently to be sought in experience, apprehended by observation and experiment. Did experience present to us isolated phenomena, i.e., phenomena so arranged that enumeration of the elementary constituents, whether antecedents or consequents, were possible, then our inductive procedure must be regulated by those canons or axioms which express the kind of evidence already referred to as establishing uniformity. These canons or axioms, however, are, like the Baconian method of exclusion, tests for an ideally perfect experience, and they, therefore, only lie in the background of actual scientific procedure, which has to employ other processes, both of inference and of proof. For, if we can in no way obtain more than a knowledge of the coexistence of facts, we are unable to bring our evidence into conformity with the inductive canons, save in the ideal instance in which absolutely exhaustive experience both of positive and negative cases is possible. Inferences as to law or uniformity of coexistence must here be based on numerical calculation of probability, and the conclusions present themselves in the peculiar numerical form appropriate to propositions of probability. Further, if the phenomena under investigation be complex, so that the canons of neither observation nor experiment are immediately applicable, the process of investigation must of necessity be the combined method of analysis and synthesis: analysis, aided by hypothetical conjecture, formulating such general laws of elementary factors as are known or presumed to exist in the case in question; synthesis, combining these laws and calculating with greater or less numerical exactness, according to the nature of the matter, the probable combined effect,—the whole tested by critical comparison of the calculated result with the actual phenomena. Here, as one can see, syllogistic procedure appears in its true scientific aspect as the form of thought by which we pass from the simple to the more complex, from the elementary essence or cause to the complex accident or effect. The elementary causes, no doubt, have no more cogent evidence than that which can be afforded by experience viewed in the light of our psychological assumption of uniformities; nevertheless the whole procedure of scientific investigation is recognized as being essentially of the type sketched in somewhat imperfect outline by Aristotle.

So far, then, as the logic of Mill is concerned, and apart from the undeniable richness and completeness of knowledge with which the various processes are treated, we note but one fundamentally new feature, namely, the explanation offered of the universal element [9:14:794] through which alone perceptions are raised into cognitions, through which alone reasoned knowledge is possible. It is the only explanation possible on the basis of psychological individualism; its value, and therefore the value of the systematic deductions from it, must depend on the accuracy and coherence of the psychological or metaphysical theory on which it is founded.

24. It was possible, however, to proceed by another route from the position taken up by Locke. If it be held that the elementary impressions, mechanically regarded as somehow arising in mind, are in themselves cognitions, then it is possible to view them as containing in themselves all possible cognition. In other words, we may confusedly identify the proposition that knowledge does not extend beyond the field of experience with the very different proposition that the only items of knowledge are the isolated impressions which appear to make up experience. If this identification be accepted (and the conception involved is precisely that underlying all consistent nominalism from Antisthenes downwards), then the only processes requiring to be taken into account are those whereby clearness and distinctness are introduced into our (possibly) vague perceptions. For these processes analysis is an adequate title. All knowledge, t.e., whatever is characterized by clearness, definiteness, consequence, is the analysis of what is given in isolated perceptions. Each perception is itself and is only itself; no judgment is possible save that of identity. In other words, if there be judgment at all, it can consist only in the assertion that, the unanalysed perception is identical with that into which it is analysed, and as each perception and each analytic portion of a perception may be signified by an arbitrary sign (name or other hieroglyphic), judgment is essentially an affair of naming, a declaration that different names are identical or belong to the same perception. Reasoning is simply the transition from one identity to another, —a more developed result of analysis. Scientific or real knowledge is an accurately framed system of signs, i.e., a collocation of signs which expresses precisely the results of the analysis of complex perceptions. Logic, under this doctrine of knowledge, is merely a statement of the various modes in which analysis is carried out, of the ways in which names are applied, and of the forms in which names are combined. Such is the theory of logic presented by Condillac.^[62. See Langue de Calcul; Art de Penser, and Logique. Cf. Laromiguiere, Leçons de Philos., 1. pp. 5-43; and Robert, Les théories logiques de Condülac, 1869. ] Logic on the Basis of Metaphysical Psychology. Leibnitz and Herbart.

25. One development from the psychology of Locke has thus appeared as an extreme formalism, which if carried out consistently must needs assume the aspect of a numerical or mechanical system of computation.^[63. Such as is hinted at by Hobbes, and as is carried out in thte various works of Professor Jevons. ] It is remarkable that a very similar result was reached by Leibnitz, a thinker who proceeded from a quite opposed psychological conception. The similarity is due to the presence in both theories of a certain abstract principle, intimately though not necessarily connected with the respective psychologies. In place of the single perception which in Condillac’s logic is the element to be analysed, there appears in Leibnitz’s view the single consciousness of the monad (see Leibnitz, t>. 424); in both cases, however, knowledge is assumed to exist there implicitly and to stand in need only of evolution. The methods by which this evolution is to proceed form for Leibnitz the substance of a new and all-comprehensive science, “Scientia Generalis,” of which the older logic is but a part.

The characteristics of Scientia Generalis are at once deducible from the two general principles which in Leibnitz’s view dominate all our thinking,—the law of sufficient reason and the law of noncontradiction. It must contain a complete account of the modes in which from data conclusions are drawn, and in which from given facts data are inferred, and since the only logical relations are those of identity and non-contradiction, the forms of inference from or to data must be the general modes of combination of simple elementary facts which are possible under the law of non-contradiction. The statement of tne data of any logical problem, and the description of the processes involved in combining them or in arriving at them, are much assisted by, if not dependent on, the employment of a general characteristic or symbolic art.

The fundamental divisions then of Scientia Generalis, so far at least as its groundwork are concerned (for Leibnitz sometimes includes under the one head all possible applications of the theory), are (1) the synthetical or combinatorial art, the theory of the processes by which from given facts complex results may be obtained (of these processes, which make up general mathesis, syllogistic and mathematical demonstration are special varieties); (2) the analytic oι i egressive art, which starting from a complex fact endeavours to attain knowledge of the data from whose combination it arose.^[64. Leibnitz sometimes includes these two under the head of “Ars Inveniendi," and places alongside of tins, as first part of Scientia Generalis, “Ars Judicandi,” a division resembling that appearing in Bacon; but the “Ars Judicandi” may be tlιrown out of account. ]

Of the nature of the second portion only a few brief indications are contained in the logical tracts and in detached utterances in the larger works of Leibnitz. When complex combinations are presented, or, in the most general form, when the investigation has to start from experience, from truths of fact, the work of analysis is endless; the regress to conditions is practically infinite. Determination of the necessary data cannot in such a case possess more than probable value, but the probabilities may be estimated according to the rules laid down in the progressive or synthetic art.^[65. Oρ. Ph., pp. 397, 398; cf. generally pp. 84, 93, 343. ] The logic of probability is thus recognized as an integral portion of the logical system.

Of the first art, the logical calculus in particular, a somewhat clearer and fuller outline is given.^[66. See specially op. Ph., pp. 92-114; also the tract “De Arte Combinatoria,” op. Ph., pp. 6-45. ] The logical calculus implies (1) the statement of data in their simplest form, (2) the assignment of the general laws under which combination of these data is possible, (3) the complete exposition of the forms of combination, (4) the employment of a definite set of symbols, both of data and of modes of combination, subject to symbolic laws arising from the laws under which combination is possible. In the Fundamenta Calculi Ratiocinatoris and the Non-inclegans Specimen Demonstrandi, something is effected towards filling up the first, second, and fourth of these rubrics, but in no case is the treatment exhaustive. The simple data, called characters or formulae, are symbolized by letters, relations of data by a somewhat complicated and varying system of algebraic signs; for the calculus, or set of operations exercised upon relations given so as to produce new formulae, no comprehensive system of symbols is adopted. Formulae, relations, and operations take the place of notions, judgments, and syllogism. The general laws of combination of data are stated without much precision. Leibnitz recognizes the law of substitution, notes also what have been called the laws of reduplication and commutativeness, but, in actual realization of his method, employs indifferently the relation of containing and contained or the relation of identical substitution (aequipollence). No attempt is made to develop a complete scheme of possible modes of combination.^[67. It is interesting to note that Leibnitz signalizes the distinction between the logical and mathematical senses of a whole, and between the distributive and the collective meaning of quantity; that he emphasizes the function of the particular judgment as the negation of its opposed universal; and that he approximales to some modem modes of formulating the judgment (a is b , e.g., he would express as a=ab , or ab is; no a is b , as ab is not). ]

At the root of Leibnitz’s universal calculus, as of Condillac’s method of analysis, and generally of nominalist logic, there lies a peculiar acceptation of the abstract law of identity. That a thing is what it is,—that knowledge of a thing is a single, indivisible, mechanical fact, susceptible only of explication or of expanded statement,—this is the principle dominating logical theories which in other respects may differ widely. Insistance upon this aspect of knowledge or of the object known is the ground for assigning to thought a function purely analytic, which is the very keynote of nominalism. It is not hard to see, however, that so to view the law of identity is to abstract from all the conditions of actual thinking and knowing, and to throw into the assumed simple fact all the complexity which is afterwards to be discovered in it by analysis. The knowledge of a thing is not to be explained in this abstract or mechanical fashion. Truth does not consist in the empty recognition that a is a, and in the repetition of this unimportant fact, but in the knowledge of the nature of a, a knowledge which essentially consists in relating a to its intellectual conditions, in assigning to it a place in the intelligible world. The identity of the tiling with itself is a mere aspect of the complex process whereby the thing is cognized. It hardly requires to be pointed out that the minor forms of the same fundamental view, the various attempts to express the essence of a judgment as the assertion of identity, are open to the same objection. They take an abstract view of the judgment, and regard as the essential fact that which is but an accessory or adjunct or consequence. Difference, to put it in the briefest fashion, is no less essential to a judgment than identity.^[68. Much of the confusion which reigns supreme in many modem works on logic is doubtless attributable to a confusion between the nature of the judgment and the result of a judgment. The result of a judgment is always an increased richness of the subject notion; the subject unqualified and the subject qualified by the predicate are doubtless identical; but it would be absurd to say, therefore, that the function of the judgment is the assertion of this identity. ]

26. The view of logic put forward by Herbart, from a metaphysico-psychological basis resembling that of Leibnitz, agrees in so many respects with that of Leibnitz, although containing no reference to the idea of a logical calculus, that it may be placed under the same head. Logic, according to Herbart, is a purely formal doctrine; it has to do only with the modes by which clearness, distinctness, and system are introduced among our ideas. Logical forms, then, the notion, judgment, and syllogism, are not to be regarded as having any metaphysical reference; they are not even to be explained psychologically; they stand on their own footing as explanatory processes exercised about the representations which under their own natural laws fill up consciousness, coming and going within the [9:14:795] sphere of apperception. According to this view the whole province of knowledge is excluded from logic, and it is assumed that knowledge is somehow given, mechanically, without the co-operation of processes, if not identical with, yet strongly resembling, those recognized as logical. Herbart does not succeed in vindicating an independent place for a purely formal logic.

The Kantian Logic.

27. The critical method, which has so influenced general philosophy that all later speculation refers more or less directly to it, has at the same time profoundly modified all later conceptions of the sphere and method of logic. From the Kantian philosophy there spring directly the three most important modern doctrines of logical theory, —that which, with many variations in detail, regards logic as a purely formal science, the science of the laws of thought or of the laws under which thought as such operates, and of the forms into which thought as such develops; that which, likewise with many variations, unites logical doctrines with a more general theory of knowledge; and finally that which identifies both logic in the narrower sense and theory of knowledge with an all-comprehensive metaphysic.

It is matter of history that the critical system was developed mainly from the basis of the Leibnitzian logical and metaphysical theories, and it is likewise matter of history that Kant, even in the speculative work which was to so large an extent antagonistic to these theories, remained under the influence of some of their cardinal positions.^[69. Sec article Kant, vol. xiii. pp. 849, 852. ] In particular the view of logical thought as purely discursive, analytic in character, a view never by Kant harmonized with his general system, is a relic, most significant for the development of his logic, from the Wolffian reproduction of Leibnitz’s philosophy. This historic basis is not to be lost sight of in attempting to acquire a clear idea of the special place and function assigned by Kant to logical theory.

But a brief reference to the general result of the critical philosophy will suffice to introduce the more special treatment of the Kantian logic. Knowledge, or real cognition, which is analysed in the Kritik in reference to its origin and validity, appears, when subjectively regarded, as a compound of intuition and thought, of sense and understanding. The isolated data of sense experience do not in themselves form parts of cognition, but are only cognized when related to the unity of the conscious subject, when the subject, as it may be put, has consciousness of them. This reflex act, resembling in some respects Leibnitz’s apperception, or process of uniting in consciousness, is an act sui generis, not to be mechanically conceived or explained. Only through its means do representations become cognitions. The forms in which the synthetic act of understanding is carried out are, as opposed to the intuitive data on which they are exercised, discursive or logical in character. Essentially they are judgments: all acts of understanding are judgments, and, as judgments, they imply a general element with which the particular of sense is combined, and in the light of which the particular becomes intelligible. In ultimate analysis it appears that no particular, whatever be its empirical character, can become an intelligible fact, save when determined through some specific act of understanding, through combination with some specific notion or general element. Combination of particular and general is thus the very essence of understanding, the mark of knowledge as such. In every item of cognition the same elements may be discerned as necessarily present. The consideration of the ultimate modes of intellectualization, of the series of acts by which understanding subsumes the particular, draws the particular into the unity of cognition, may be called in a large sense logic. If the consideration be specially directed to the mode in which, by means of this combination, knowledge arises, and therefore include discussion of the wide problem regarding the relation between understanding and objectivity in general (the matter of knowledge taken generally), the special title transcendental logic may be used. But if, concentrating attention solely on the kind of operation implied in understanding, we endeavour to lay out fully the modes in which understanding proceeds in the construction of knowledge, making abstraction of all inquiries regarding the origin, worth, significance of knowledge itself, the consideration is of a more general character, and may receive the title of general logic.^[70. It does not seem necessary to advert more in detail to the divisions and subdivisions of logic drawn out la the Kritik, pp. 8G-93 (Hartenstein ’ s ed., 1868). ]

The understanding, then, like everything else, works according to laws, the laws of its own nature. If we abstract from all that may characterize the matter considered, and take into account solely the laws according to which understanding must act, we may construct a purely formal doctrine, a theory which is rational both in matter and in form, for the matter consists of the laws of reason, and the form is prescribed by the very nature of reason,—a demonstrative theory, for nothing can enter therein which cannot be shown to have its ground in reason,—a completed theory, for although the matter of thought is infinite and infinitely varied, the modes in which the understanding must operate if unity of cognition is to result, are finite and capable of exhaustive statement, —and a theory developed from its own basis, standing in no need of psychology or metaphysics, but deducible from the mere idea of understanding as that which introduces unity into representations, whether given (empirical) or a priori (pure).

Were this the only determination of the province of logic given by Kant, the question which at once arises as to the possibility of any such independent doctrine would receive an easy solution. For it is evident that logic, as a theory of the form of thought, could consist only of a portion of the more general doctrine, by whatever title that be known, in which the nature of understanding as synthetic activity is unfolded. The distinction on which Kant lays stress between matter and form, a distinction employed by all subsequent writers of his school, is ambiguous and misleading. If by matter be meant the particular characteristics of the things thought about, in which sense we might speak of judgments of physical, chemical, grammatical matter, and so on, then to say that logic does not take this into account is perfectly inept. If logic be a philosophic discipline at all, a theory in any way concerned with thinking, it is at once evident that it can in no way deal with the specialities of any particular science. But this distinction between matter and form is by no means identical with another, lying in the background, and too frequently confused with the first,—the distinction of understanding as a faculty per se with its own laws, deducible from its mere notion, and understanding as the concrete real act of thinking. What Kant calls the mere idea of understanding, and what in other writers of his school appears as a definition of thought, is really nothing but a reference to what has presented itself in the wider inquiries of the Kritik as the complex nature of the synthetic activity of understanding. Kant himself never attempts to deduce from the notion of understanding the varied characteristics of logical forms, and his followers,— e.g., Hamilton,—when they are consistent, start from concepts as expressing the bare notion of thought, and regard all other forms of thought as combinations of concepts.

But Kant does introduce another element into his treatment of the province of logic, one not original to him, but of the utmost importance for later developments from his point of view. He inquires- what kind of relations among the elements of thought can form the matter of logical treatment, and defines these as two in number— (1) formal consequence, (2) non-contradictoriness. By formal consequence we are to understand the relation between a conclusion and its premisses, no inquiry being raised as to the truth or validity of the premisses. By non-contradictoriness we are to understand that, logically, notions, judgments, or reasonings can be subjected to treatment only in regard to the absence of explicit contradiction among the factors entering into them. Thought, which introduces unity and system into experience, must certainly introduce formal consequence and preserve analytic truth or correctness. Formal logic, then, treats only of these formal qualities of all products of thought,^[71. Two at least of the followers of Kant have worked out the system of logi<r from this point of view,—the one, Twesten, in his Logik, insbesondere die Analytik (1825), the other, the late Professor Mansel, in his Prolegomena Logica. Mansel recognizing the distinction between the two modes of determining foιτnal logic, adopts the second, and is therefore led, in consistency, to define logic, not as the science of the laws and forms of thought, but as the science treating of formal thought, or of the formal element in the forms of thought. In other words, he recognizes that the statement of the forms of thought must be introduced into logic ab extra, from psychology or what not, and that logic, accepting these, has to consider the formal element (non-contradictoriness) in them. It is well to have the doctrine brought thus to its ultimate issue, for it is thence apparent that there is no independent science called logic, but simply one comprehensive precept, which may be called logical, viz., avoid contradictoriness in thought. Illustrations of the ways in which contradictoriness manifests itself may be offered, and a useful logical praxis may thus be afforded, but these do not make up a science or theory. ] s ^

The detailed treatment of logic, so far as that can be gathered from the very brief summary {Logik, Werke, iii. 269-340), shows with the utmost clearness how impossible it was for Kant to deduce the forms and relations of thought from the mere notion of understanding, even when coupled with the principles of formal consistency and consequence. Assuming that understanding is the discursive faculty, the faculty of cognizing the many particulars through the one concept or notion, Kant deals first with concepts (Begriffe) as general or discursive representations. He is careful to avoid an error into which many of his followers have fallen, that of regarding Begriffe in a mechanical fashion as a specific kind of Vorstellung, distinguished only by containing a few of the marks making up the single intuitions. He rightly notes that cognition proceeds by subsuming the particulars under the common element contained in them, and that the generality of the concept thus rests upon the relation in which it stands, as reflective ground of cognition, to the particulars. The characteristics of concepts, as possessing extent and content, are treated briefly, after the fashion familiar in the more detailed logics of his school. It is, however, when the doctrine of judgment is reached that the difficulties of his position appear with greatest distinctness. Judgment is defined “as the representation of unity in the consciousness of distinct representations, or the representation of the relation of [9:14:796] these, in so far as they make up a concept.”^[72. Logii, § 17. ] But the essential element in the definition—the unity of consciousness or unification of differences in a notion—is thus left so vague and undetermined that it is impossible to deduce from it any classification or any peculiarities of judgments, and possible indeed to proceed on two quite distinct lines of research. The expression, indeed, refers to that which is the fundamental fact in the critical system, the existence of conditions under which only it is possible for detached data of experience to become objects of knowledge for the single conscious subject; and, had Kant been true to the principles of his system, it would then have been necessary to base any classification and treatment of judgment on the enumeration of the functions of unity in conscious experience. In the Kritik ^[73. Analytik, § 19. ] emphasis is laid upon the function of unity as the essence of the judgment, but it is a well-known historic fact that Kant makes no attempt to justify in its details the enumeration of such functions on which his divisions rest. His followers in the field of logic,^[74. See specially the treatment of judgment by Esser (Logik, §§56 and 61∖ and Jakob (Log u. Met., §§ 189, 194, 201, 202). where the division of judgments into categoιιcai, hypothetical, and disjunctive flows from a quite arbitrary and artificial principle. ] misconceiving the real relation of form to matter, interpreted the unity involved in the judgment as being a merely quantitative relation between given notions.^[75. See Twesten, Logik, §§ 51-57, and 61; Hamilton, Logic, i. 230 sg. It may here be remarked that Hamilton’s mode of translating the relative sections of k ru g and Esser, his main authorities for the details of the Kantian logic, clearly shows that he did not attach any special significance to the phrase, unity of consciousness. In his view, the unity implied in the judgment A is B was the union of A and B in the notion of a given totality or whole—A being part of B in one aspect, B being part of A in another. This relation of whole and part is quite un-Kantian. r h ] There is here involved a twofold error, which has exercised a most pernicious influence on the fortunes of logical theory. For, in the first place, so to view judgment is implicitly to proceed from the assumption of notions as given elements of knowledge, the relations of which are to be discovered by comparison or analysis of what is contained in them. The notion as empirically given thus becomes the fundamental fact; all other forms of thought, judgment, and syllogism are regarded as merely the mechanism by which the content of notions is evolved. Such a doctrine puts out of sight the peculiarities of the notion as the product of thought only, inevitably compels a distinction between what we may call the real processes of thinking whereby notions are formed and the elaborative processes by which notions when formed may be treated, and, by regarding notions as simplest data, leads back to the old nominalist doctrine according to which all thinking is but the compounding and separating of simple elements.^[76. It is by this course that the curious phenomenon of an algebraic or symbolic logic springing from the Kantian groundwork has come about. The same result follows, indeed, from any view of thought as merely exercised about facts which are already m themselves completed cognitions, whether we call these notions <wιth Hamilton) or πpωτα (with Antisthenes) or elementary data (with Leibnitz) or simple apprehensions (with the nominalists), the result is the same ] And, in the second place, there is involved iι⅛ all this the underlying prejudice, which it was the very business of the critical system to destroy, the attempt to treat knowledge, and thought, which is an integral part of knowledge, in a purely mechanical fashion. The Kantian analysis for the first time in the history of philosophy brought into clear light the essential peculiarity of knowledge, the reference of all the manifold details of experience to the unity of the thinking subject. Such reference, and the modes in which it expresses itself, are not to be conceived, mechanically, nor can we regard the products of thought, the notion, judgment, and reasoning, in the same fashion in which, with but partial success, we treat, in psychology, the representations or reproductions in idea of actual fact. The essence of thought, the unity in difference of objects known and subject cognizing, is that which constitutes in its several modes the peculiarity of notions, judgments, and reasonings. The notion is simply the work of thought, looked at, if the expression be allowed, statically. There is no single psychical product, to be treated by the method of observation which is applied in psychology to sensations and ideas, which can be called the notion. Mental facts, which rightly or wrongly psychology deals with after its mechanical fashion, present themselves in a new aspect when they are regarded as parts, or rather as organic elements, in cognition. If we endeavour to apply the abstracting, isolating method of observation ab extra to them, doubtless only mechanical, abstract, and external relations will manifest themselves as obtaining among them, and there may thus be deduced a mass of abstract formulae expressing relations of agreement and disagreement, total or partial coincidence, confliction, intersection, or coexistence and sequence, which have abstract truth, but are in no way adequate to express the genuine nature of thought.

Kant himself proceeds, as was said, by simply assuming, as somehow given, the cardinal forms of unity in consciousness, and, distinguishing form of judgment from matter by the apparently simple difference between matters united and form of uniting, draws out the types of judgment under the familiar rubrics of quality, quantity, relation, and modality. The same assumption of distinctions only to be given by the higher researches of transcendental logic is manifested in his treatment of reasoning, the deduction of one judgment from others. Three main types of such deduction are signalized (1) deductions of the understanding, in which the conclusion follows simply from change in the form of the given judgment; (2) deductions of reason, in which the necessity of the deduced proposition is shown by reference to a general rule under which it falls; (3) deductions of judgment, in which the conclusion is reached by the treatment of given experience in reference to a general rule of reflexion upon experience. Under the first of these fall the familiar forms of immediate inference; under the second, syllogism in its three varieties, categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive; under the third, inductive and analogical reasoning. The understanding, if one may interpret Kant freely, is the process by which the worth of what is given is fixed and determined; it moves not beyond the given fact, and can therefore subject the fact to no other than formal transformation. The determining judgment or reason is the expression of the fundamental fact in knowledge that all experience is subject to general rules or conditions; there must therefore be a determination of the particular by the general; there must be ground for subsuming the particular and the universal. The forms of such subsumption and determination of the particular by the general are syllogisms. Syllogism therefore is the mode in which the essence of cognition is made explicit. The reflective judgment is the expression of the tendency to treat the contingent details of this or that given experience after the analogy of the general rule that all experience is subject to intellectual determinations. This analogy does not necessitate the specific determination of the particular by any specific universal, but serves as general directrix in experiential researches. It is sufficiently evident that a remodelling of the older logical doctrine such as this rests upon a wider and more comprehensive philosophical view of knowledge as a whole, that such distinctions cannot flow from either of the principles previously indicated as those on which the formal conception of logic rested, and, finally, that the logical aspect of these distinctions is formal in the only true sense of that word, viz., in that the treatment is of necessity general, applicable to all or any thinking.

28. As in the Kantian system there were placed, side by side, two diverse conceptions of logical system, that of transcendental logic, and that of formal logic, without any adequate link of connexion between them, so from the Kantian position there diverged two quite distinct schools of logic, the transcendental or metaphysical, and the formal. As regards the second of these, but little requires to be said. The great body of logical treatises written from the Kantian formal point of view contain nothing of interest. In them the traditional logic is handled under the rubrics supplied by the Kantian general philosophy, with more or less of purifications from needless detail, according to the acuteness or insight of the writers, with more or less of deviation from the Kantian lines. In but few cases did the real difficulty, that of assigning to formal logic an independent plan and method, lead to a radically fresh treatment.^[77. Generally, the formal logician is compelled simply to take the processes of thought as determined in psychology or metaphysics or what not, and to consider certain aspects of them. His science has, therefore, no independent place, and no method of development. Independence may be striven after, either by attempting to develop all processes of thought and their logical peculiarities from an initial definition of thought solely, or by combining with this definition the view that non-contradictoriness is the one logical quality, and thus assigning to logic the discussion of the conditions of non-contradiction In thought. Of the first, Hamilton may be taken as the type; of the second, Twesten, Mai.sel, and Spalding. ] ®

The Kantian transcendental logic, being an analysis of the conditions under which objectivity in general becomes possible material for cognition, is in a special sense a new theory of thought. For thoughtis the process mediating the unity of the ego and the multifarious detail of actual experience; and only through thought, the universal, are objects so determined that they are possible matters of knowledge for a conscious subject. As determinations of objects, the pure elements of thought may be called notions, while the realization of notions in conscious experience is the judgment, wherein the universal of thought and the particular of sense are synthetically united, and the systematization of experience is the syllogism. Notion, judgment, and syllogism are thus, in the transcendental logic, no bare, abstract forms, but have as their content the pure determinations of objectivity in general. They cannot be conceived mechanically, as mere products differing only in degree of generality and abstractness from the ideas, and connexions of association which appear as due merely to the psychological mechanism of the human consciousness. They are the essential forms of the ultimate synthesis through which knowledge becomes possible, and thus express in their organic system the very nature of thought, i e., of the thinking subject. In the Kantian doctrine, however, as it developed itself historically, there are various points of view which disturb the harmony of the system as thus sketched. Two in particular require special notice, as from these the later attempts at a complete revision of logical theory have taken their origin. (1) [9:14:797] Throughout the Kantian work there appears a constant tendency to regard the ego, or central unity of self-consciousness, as merely abstract, as related mechanically, not organically, to the complex of experience in which its inner nature is unfolded. This tendency finds expression in various ways. Thus the synthesis, which has been shown to be the essential feature of cognition, is regarded as on its subjective side a union of intellectual function and receptivity of sense, and the contributions from either side are viewed as somehow complete in themselves.^[78. See vol. xiii. pp. 851, 852. ] Knowledge, in accordance with this, might be considered to be the mechanical result of the combination or coherence of the two, a combination which in the last resort must appear to the conscious subject as contingent or accidental. (2) Knowledge, the systematic union of universal and particular in experience, is thought as containing in some obscure fashion a reference to the most real world, the realm of things in themselves, and therefore as being, in antithesis thereto, strictly subjective. The processes of thought, by which unity is given to experience, thus manifest themselves as limited in scope, and as being the very ground or reason of the restriction of knowledge to phenomenal in opposition to noumenal reality.^[79. It is unnecessary to consider what exactly was Kant’s teaching on either of these points, or what the significance of the relative doctrine may be in ills system. It is sufficient, for the historical purpose in hand, to indicate the apparent tendency of his work, for from this the later developments take their rise. ]

The presence of these two difficulties or perplexities in the Kantian system, which are, indeed, at bottom but one, led to revision of transcendental logic in two directions. The one line proceeded from the analysis of knowledge as the product of intellectual function and receptivity, and, uniting therewith metaphysical conceptions of varied kinds, culminated in a doctrine of cognition which, retaining the distinction between real and ideal as ultimate, endeavoured to show that the forms of the ideal, i.e., of thought, and the forms of reality were parallel. Logic, under this new conception, appeared as a comprehensive theory of knowledge, the systematic treatment of the modes in which thought, conditioned by its own nature and by the nature of the reality upon which it is exercised, develops into knowledge, i.e., of the modes in which a representation of things characterized by universality and evidential force is obtained. On the whole this is the position assigned to logic by Schleiermacher, whose view is followed in essentials, though with many variations in detail, by a large and important school of logical writers.^[80. See, for an enumeration of the more prominent members, Ueberweg’s Logik, § 34, a work which itself is an admirable exposition from the same point of view. ]

The second direction may be characterized generally as the attempt to develop fully what is involved in Kant’s conception of thought as the essential factor of cognition. Any opposition between metaphysic as dealing with the real and logic as dealing with the ideal element in knowledge appears, in this view, as a mere effort of false abstraction. The very nature of reality is its nature in and for thought. The system of pure determinations of objectivity, which Kant had imperfectly sketched, is not to be regarded as a piece of subjective machinery, because it expresses the inmost conditions of intelligence as such. Nothing is more real than the ego, than intelligence or thought. Transcendental logic, or logic which is at the same time metaphysic, is the only discipline to which the title logic by right belongs. For it contains the complete system of the forms in and through which intelligence is realized. The notion, judgment, and syllogism are doubtless forms of thought, but they have their definite content. They are the modes in which the forms of objectivity are realized for intelligence, and are thus at once abstract and concrete. The so-called formal logic is a mere caput mortuum, a descriptive study of some few types of the application of thought to matters of experience. On the whole this is the view of logic developed through Fichte (and in part Schelling) by Hegel, ana the Hegelian system shall here be regarded as its complete and only representative.

Logic as Theory of Knowledge.

29. The position assigned to logic as theory of knowledge and the range of problems included in it are determined by the general philosophic view of the distinction between the reality to be apprehended by thought and the subjective nature of thought itself. There may be, therefore, numberless variations in the mode of treating logic with general adherence to the one point of view.^[81. < It appears an historic error to identify the point of view here referred to with the Aristotelian. The notion of a parallelism between the forms of reality and the forms of knowledge is too definite to be covered by the mere expression, whether in Aristotle or in Plato, of the doctrine that knowledge is knowledge of being. ] In the Dialektik of Schleiermacher, for example, the fundamental characteristic is the attempt to unite some portions of the Kantian analysis of cognition with Spinozistic metaphysic. Knowledge is regarded as the complex combination of intellect, the formative, unifying, idealizing faculty, and organization or receptivity of sense. The generality or common validity of cognition rests on the uniform nature of organization and on the identity of all ideas in the one ideal system. The objective worth of cognition is referred on the one hand to the determined connexion between the real universe and the organization through which the individual is part of the real order of things, on the other hand to the ultimate metaphysical J parallelism between the system of ideas and reality. The primary orms of knowledge, notion, and judgment, distinct from one another only as being knowledge viewed now as stable now as in process, correspond to the ultimate elements of the real, the permanent force or substance and its variable manifestations. Syllogism and induction, with the subordinate processes of definition and division, analysis and synthesis, are technical modes of the development of notions and judgments, modes by which inchoate notions are rendered definite, by which incomplete judgments are rendered complete.^[82. Perhaps the most complete treatment of logic from this point of view is that of George, Logik als Wissenschaftslehre, 1868. Ueberweg, dissenting from Schleiermacher’s view of syllogism and the systematic processes of reasoning, lays out more fully what in his view are the aspects of reality corresponding to the typical forms of knowledge. Trendelenburg endeavours to fill up the gap between real and ideal by emphasizing the community of character between motion, as the ultimate reality, and constructiveness in knowledge, the central activity of the ideal. ] ®

That there is much valuable and suggestive material in this mode of regarding logic is undoubted, and in the discussion of isolated forms of knowledge, such as judgment, it is always desirable that there should be kept in mind the reference to the ultimate character of objectivity. But the whole point of view seems imperfect and open to such objections as will always present themselves when a principle is not carried out to its full extent. It may, for propaedeutic purposes, be desirable to separate the handling of logical forms from metaphysic, but such separation cannot be ultimate. The system of forms of reality to which the forms of knowledge are assumed to correspond must in some way enter into knowledge, and they cannot enter in as an absolutely foreign ingredient, to which knowledge has simply to conform itself. For, if so, these metaphysical categories would be discoverable only by an analysis of’ concrete knowledge, and they would remain as inferences from the nature of cognition, not as data directly known. The cardinal difficulty which appears in all treatments of logic from this point of view is that of explaining how there comes to be known an objective system of things with characteristic forms or aspects, and it is not hard to see that the acceptance of a reality so formed is but a relic of the pernicious abstraction which gave rise to the Kantian severance of knowledge from noumenal reality.^[83. Thus we find in Schleiermacher (.Dial., §§ 132-34) that the ultimate difference of ideal and real is accepted as simple datum. In Ueberweg (Logik, § 8 and passim) there is continuous reference to an inner order of things, the forms of which are the metaphysical categories, but the actual treatment is altogether independent of these forms, and we may conjecture that, in the last resort, Ueberweg would have explained the characterisι ics of logical thinking by reference rather to the psychological mechanism than to a supposed nature of things (see Logik, §§ 40-42), and thus approximated to the position of Beneke rather than to that of Schleiermacher. ] ® In short the position taken by Schleiermacher and his school, as final standing ground, is but an intermediate stage in the development of that which lay implicit in the critical philosophy.

Moreover, it is hardly possible to assume this point of view without tending to fall back into that mechanical view of knowledge from which Kant had endeavoured to free philosophy. If there be assumed the severance between real and ideal, it is hardly possible to avoid deduction of all that is characteristic of the ideal order from the observed or conjectured psychological peculiarities of inner experience. The real appears only as ultimate point of reference, but in no other way determines the form of knowledge. The characteristic relations which give content to notions, judgments, and syllogisms are deduced psychologically.^[84. This tendency, which appears in Schleiermacher and Ueberweg, ar d indeed in all the logics of that school (George’s Logik, e.g., is hardly to be distinguished from psychology), is prominent in Beneke. It is curious to note a precis ly similar result in the logical theory of Mr H. Spencer. Mr Spencer supposes himself to be throughout referring to the nature of reality, but in fact all that is specific in the forms of reasoning developed by him is of psychological origin (sec Pr. of Psych., ii. §§ 302-9). ] In the long run, it would no doubt be found that the real key to the position is the belief, more or less expressed, that the systematic view of thought as comprehending and evolving the forms of reality is an unattainable ideal,—that metaphysic, to put it briefly, is impossible. To some extent this is the position taken by Lotze, whose cautious and ever thoughtful expositions are invariably directed to the elucidation of the real nodi, the real roots of perplexity or incompleteness of doctrine. In his view logical forms are the modes in which thought works up the material, supplied in inner experience by the psychological mechanism of the soul, in conformity to the ultimate presuppositions with the aid of which alone can harmony, or ethical and aesthetic completeness, be gained for our conceptions of things. But with this doctrine, which approaches more clearly than any other of the type to the metaphysical logic, there is coupled the reserve that any actual point of view from which the development of these presuppositions, their rational explanation, might become possible is unattainable. Our confidence in them is finally of an ethical character, and depends upon our conviction of the ethical end or purpose of all the surroundings within which human life and [9:14:798] character is manifested. In logic as in metaphysic we must content ourselves with more or less fragmentary treatment.^[85. J m ⅛λ⅛°κ vi6 ^ a 0f the gθnetic c ∞nexion of the forms of thought is peculiar to himself, and deserves separate treatment ] Logic as Metaphysical.

30. To understand the peculiarities of this, the final conception of logic, we must take into account the ultimate view of knowledge as that in which thought and reality are united, and of philosophy generally as the attempt to develop the whole system of these abstract determinations of thought by which coherence and intelligibility are given to knowledge. In it there is carried out to the full extent Kant’s idea of thought as the ultimate germ of intelligibility.

In the critical system, as we have seen, the fundamental idea was continuously disturbed by the intrusion of doctrines which possessed significance only when the problems were treated from a quite opposed point of view. Thus the abstract separation of conscious experience, regulated according to the conditions of the unity of thought, from a supposed realm of reality involved the consideration of the subject as one portion or item of a mechanical whole. In other words, the Kantian system proved itself unable to unite in a comprehensive fashion the two ideas of thought as the universal in experience and of thought as the activity or mode of realization of the individual subject. The central point of view, that which refers all in experience to the unity of thought, was continuously departed from, and as a natural consequence the various forms or modes of thought were treated, not in relation to their ultimate unity, but as isolated facts, to be dealt with by principles resting on a totally opposed doctrine. It is the essence of the Hegelian method to keep continuously in view the concrete unity and totality of thought, to treat each special aspect or determination as an integral portion of an organic whole, a portion which must prove itself unintelligible and contradictory if regarded apart from its relations to the whole, and so to avoid these mechanical separations and abstractions which had proved fatal to the Kantian doctrine. In the development of a method which rests upon and endeavours to retain so comprehensive a point of view, there must of necessity be much that is tentative and «imperfect. Differences of opinion regarding the main stages in the development, regarding the particular content of any one stage, are quite compatible with adhesion to the general principle of the whole.^[86. . Hegel himself fully recognizee the tentative character of the numerous ±≡ a f n h∕∕ a88 ∙ ’. flcat i 0, l °∙ the c at CR°>' ies of thought which makeup the sub-SK “hi. ¾x⅛ a ≡s ÎSV ““ ta “ “ » s >' <≡- ] But from this point of view only can justice be done to those forms of thought which have always been regarded as the special material of logical treatment; from any other, the treatment must be partial, fragmentary, and, so to speak, external. Thus, notion, judgment, and syllogism are not, in this view, treated as merely subjective modes in which the individual consciousness apprehends and works up the material of experience, but as higher, more developed, and therefore richer forms of the determinations of thought in and through which intelligibility of experience is acquired. The whole system of these determinations of thought, the categories, is the matter of logic; the realization of them in subjective experience, or the treatment of the successive phases of consciousness in which abstract thought comes to be recognized in and by the individual, is the matter of the philosophy of spirit, of which psychology is one portion. Doubtless the logical treatment may be led up to by tracing the modes in which the full consciousness of the determinations of thought as the essence of reality is attained, but such introduction is propaedeutic merely, and within the logical system itself the starting-point must be the simplest, least definite of those categories whereby for spirit the realm of fact becomes intelligible.

The nature of the opposition between this view and that of the ordinary logic, which in the main rests upon the principle of individualist psychology, that the content of knowledge is derived ab extra, from an entirely foreign world of fact, will become more clear if there be considered specially the treatment which under the two methods is given to the notion. Notions, in ordinary logic, are regarded as products formed from the data supplied by presentative and representative experience, and the mode of formation as generally conceived is a continuous process of critical comparison, recognition of differences, similarities, and grouping of like facts. Not only then does the notion present itself as relatively poor and meagre in content, a kind of attenuated individual, not only are the only characteristics presented to the operation of thought mechanical and external, but the final product appears as a mere subjective abbreviation of what is given in experience. In the process, however, even as it is ordinarily conceived, there is more involved than is apparent on the surface. The individuals subjected to the abstracting and generalizing activity of thought are qualified individuals, ke., individuals viewed as determined in their own nature and in respect of thought by a whole network of relations, which when stated abstractly are really of the nature of categories. They are individuals only for a unifying intelligence which views them under diverse aspects, and these aspects are the blank forms of intelligibility, which it is the very function of logic to consider in system. Moreover, the purely formal acceptation of the notion as a mere mental hieroglyphic or sign stands in sharp contradiction to the view which as a rule accompanies it, and which, for the most part, receives explicit statement in a so-called applied logic or doctrine of method, that in the notion is contained the representation of the essence or tnιth of reality. It is impossible to retain with any consistency the merely arithmetical or numerical doctrine of the notion, as containing fewer marks than the individual, of the genus.as characterized by a less number of attributes than the species, and so on. Underlying all genuine knowledge, all classification, and therefore all formation of notions, is the tendency towards the subordination of parts to a law which determines them. The generic attributes are not simply the points of agreement, but the determining characteristics, and the notion of a thing is the explicit recognition of its nature as a particular manifestation of a universal law.

-Thus even within the limits of the ordinary logic there are problems which force upon it the reconsideration of the view which regards the notion as merely a mechanically formed psychical fact. Knowledge, no doubt, is only realized subjectively, in and through psychical facts, but the treatment of it in its nature as knowledge, and the treatment of its psychical aspect, are toto genere distinct, The metaphysical doctrine which keeps consistently in view thought as the essence of knowledge in its own nature has therefore to contemplate the notion in strictest relation to thought, as one mode in which objectivity as such is apprehended, made intelligible, and, in a very special sense, as the mode in which the nature of thought is made explicit. Thus the notion can only appear as uniting and comprehending under a new aspect these intellectual determinations whereby things are related to one another in a cognizable system.

The special characteristic of the Hegelian logic, the methodical principle of development of the determinations of thought, requires for its full elucidation a longer treatment than is compatible with the scope of a general sketch. But it seems necessary to add a word respecting certain difficulties or objections which apply, not specially to the methodical principle of Hegel’s logic, but generally to the idea of a logic which is at the same time metaphysic or a treatment of ultimate notions. These objections may be variously put, according to the special point of view assumed by the critic, but they are in the long run dependent on one mode of interpretation of the fundamental antithesis between being, or reality, and thought. For whether we say that it is confusion to identify thought-forms with relations of fact, that it is unphilosophical to assume that being of necessity conforms to thought, that thought is purely subjective and knowledge the system of forms in and through which the subjective is brought after its own nature to an adequate representation of objective fact, or point to phenomena of perception as showing that even adequate correspondence, not to speak of identity, between subjective and objective must be matter of discussion, or lay stress upon the procedure of science as negativing the preliminary assumption of the logico-metaphysical assumption, we but express in varied ways a fundamental interpretation of the opposition between reality and knowledge. We assume an initial distinction, the grounds and precise nature of which are never made clear. For the antithesis between thought and reality is an antithesis in and by means of conscious experience, and is not to be comprehended save through conscious experience. If, indeed, we start with conscious experience as a mechanically formed tertium quid, something which arises out of the correlation of an unknown subject and an unknown object, we may certainly retain, as an ever-recurring and insoluble problem, the possibility of cognizing either factor per sc. But the problem arises not from the antithesis but from our way of reading or interpreting it. Opposition between subjective thinking and the real world of fact, slow, tentative, and imperfect development in individual consciousness of knowledge which contains in essential relation the opposed elements, distinction therefore of the metaphysical or real categories which determine the nature of object as knowable from the ideal or logical categories which express more specifically the fashion in which the knowable object is reduced to the subjective form of cognition, are not only perfectly compatible with, but are strictly reasoned conclusions from, the ultimate doctrine that in thought alone is to be found the secret both of knowing and of being. To bring against this doctrine the continuous complaint that it assumes an identity which, if it can be proved at all, at least demands proof, is to misunderstand the very notion of identity which plays so important a part in the objection. Not even in the most judicious and thoughtful critics of metaphysical logic, in Lotze for example,^[87. See his Logik (1843), pp. 10, 11, and Logik (1874), bk. iii,, chaps. 4, 5. ] does one find a sufficiently careful distinction between a mere question of nomenclature (z.c., whether we shall restrict the title logic to the portion of general system which deals with notions, judgments, and syllogism, while reserving for metaphysics all the other inquiries) and the question of theoretical [9:14:799] importance, whether there remains over and above the difference between the more immediate determinations of thought and its more complex or reflective modesan essential difference in knowledge between thought and reality. In less careful critics the oversight simply leads to the contention that we shall always repeat the problem of knowing and being as insoluble, and shall view knowledge as a mechanical, subjective product.

Many of these objections doubtless result from a very simple fact, more than once alluded to in this article. Particular distinctions, apparently the most elementary, frequently involve and are unintelligible apart from a developed, though not necessarily consistent or well grounded, conception of things in general. Thus the emphasis laid upon thought as essentially subjective, as being merely the system of operations whereby the individual brings into order and coherence in his own experience what is furnished ab extra through the natural connexion in which he is placed to the objective world, seems at first sight the most simple and direct consequence of the actually given distinction between the individual as one natural unit and the sum of things comprehending him and all others. But, on analysing more closely the title for applying to philosophical problems a view which is that of practical life, and doubtless legitimate and necessary within that sphere, we readily become aware of a whole series of speculative assumptions implicit in that view, and possibly without any adequate justification. At all events, whether or not the view be ultimately defensible, and in the same form in which it is at first assumed, it is unphilosophical to start in the treatment of a difficult and important discussion from principles so ambiguous and undetermined. The practical difference between the individual agent and the external sphere within which his individual operations are realized and which is therefore treated by him, from his point of view, as external, throws no light per se on the nature of the ultimate relation between the individual thinker as such and the world within which his thought is exercised. The confusion between ultimate distinctions and practical points of view is productive of most pernicious consequences not only in logic specially but in philosophy at large.

Criticism of the Chief Logical Schools.

31. It will probably be now apparent that determination of the nature, province, and method of logic is, and has always been, dependent on the conception formed as to the nature of knowledge. Discussions regarding the precise definition of logic are not mere analytical disputes regarding the best mode of expressing in terms the nature of a subject sufficiently agreed upon; variations in the treatment of particular portions of logical discipline do not arise from more or less accurate discrimination of the nature and relations of given material; nor are differences in respect to the amount of logical matter to be considered mere expressions of difference as to the range of the same fundamental principles. The grounds for divergence are much more deeply seated, and, looking back upon the historical survey of the main conceptions of logical science, it seems quite impossible to hope that by comparison and selection certain common points of view or methods may be extracted, to which the title of logical might beyond dispute be applied. The logic, as one may call it, of each philosophical theory of knowledge is an integral part or necessary consequence of such theory; and its validity, whether in whole or in part, depends upon the completeness and coherence of the explanation of knowledge in general which forms the essence of that theory. Any criticism of a general conception of logic or special application thereof, which does not rest upon criticism of the theory of knowledge implied in it, must be inept and useless. It is not possible to include such expanded criticism in an article like the present; there remains therefore only one aspect of these various logical schemes which may be subjected to special and isolated examination, viz., the inner coherence of each scheme as presented by its author. Naturally such an examination can be applied only to views which imply the separate existence of logic as a body of doctrine developing into system from its own, peculiar principles. When it is a fundamental position that logic as such has no separate existence, but is one with the all-comprehensive doctrine or theory of the ultimate nature of cognition, it is not possible to criticize such conception of logic separately; criticism of logic then becomes criticism of the whole philosophical system. In most of the views brought before us, however, a special place has been assigned to logic; it is therefore possible to apply internal criticism to the more important of these general views, and to consider how far the pretensions of logic to an Independent position and method are substantiated.

From the foregoing remarks it will also have become apparent that a general classification of logical schools, as opposed to the reference of these to ultimate distinctions of philosophical theory, is impossible. A distribution into formal (subjective), real (empirical, or, as certain German authorities designate it, Erkenntniss-theoretisch), and metaphysical conceptions of logic is rather confusing than helpful. For the formal logics of the Kantian writers, of Hamilton, and of Mansel are distinct, not only from one another, but from such equally formal logics as those of Hobbes, Condillac, Leibnitz, Herbart, Ulrici, Boole, De Morgan, and Jevons. Logicas theory of knowledge presents quite special features when handled by Mill, or by Schleiermacher, Ueberweg, Beneke, and Wundt. And it cannot even be admitted that the threefold classification affords room, without violence, for the Aristotelian logical researches. There are no points of agreement and difference so unambiguous that by their aid a division can be effected.^[88. Nor are more detailed classifications, such as those of Rosenkranz {Die Mod(ficationen der Logik, 1842), Prantl (Die Bedeutung der Logik, 1849), Rabus (Neueste Bestrebungen, 1880), of service, except when historical. ]

32. Few conceptions of logic contain, with so little real ground, such professions of completeness and independence as that developed in the writings of the Kantian school.^[89. Under this head Kant himself, for reasons above given, is not included; the writers refeιτed to are named in Ueberweg (Logik, § 34). ] According to this view, logic is a pure science, having as its special material the form of thought, demonstrative in character and with theorems capable of complete deduction from the elementary principles contained in the very notion of form as opposed to matter of thought. But, when one comes to the examination of the system itself, one finds (a) that the notions of form and matter are much too stubborn to lend themselves readily to analysis, and that explanations of what exactly constitutes form fluctuate between a merely negative definition (whatever is not treated in any other science, philosophical or otherwise) and a psychological deduction from the assumed nature of thought;^[90. Mill’s criticism on Hamilton's confused statements regarding foιτns (Exam, of Hamilton, 438-454), is perfectly applicable to the generality of the Kantian treatises on logic. ] (δ) that the really important factor in determining the contents of logical science is psychology, from which much more is borrowed than the mere preliminary definition of thought; (c) that demonstrative character rests entirely on an abstract interpretation of the laws of identity and non-contradiction , {d) that throughout the whole system there is not a trace of development, but merely the reiterated application of the law of identity and contradiction, or of some confused distinction between form and matter, to logical products, the notion, judgment, and syllogism, whose nature, characteristics, and distribution are arbitrarily accepted from psychology or general criticism or what not. Thus, in the majority of cases, logicians who simply followed the lines indicated by Kant introduced into their system, without any criticism, the fundamental distinctions contained in the Kritik d. reinen Vernunft. The fourfold scheme of quantity, quality, relation, and modality was applied without hesitation, though in varied and always artificial fashion, to notions;^[91. See, eg., Krug, Logik, § 25 sq. v. ] judgments were accepted as being categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive in kind, though the differences are altogether foreign to the logical principle applied; and generally no attempt was made to do more than treat, in an abstract fashion, some aspects of a procedure of thought determined in all its phases by extra-logical considerations. The inevitable result of such a treatment was the undue preponderance given to the doctrine of notions, which, being viewed after the fashion of Kant as given, completed products, appeared as the ultimate units of thought, to be combined, separated, and grouped together in all the higher processes. The peculiarities of the logical system which is commonly associated with the name of Sir W. Hamilton spring entirely from this view of notions. For, if notions be regarded as the elements of thought, then the judgment which elaborates them can only present itself as the explicit statement of immediate relations discernible among notions. These immediate relations reduce themselves, for Hamilton, to one,—the quantitative relation of whole and part,—and, attention being concentrated on the extensive reference of concepts, the eightfold scheme of propositional forms is the natural consequence. To such a scheme the objections are manifold. It is neither coherent in itself, nor expressive of the nature of thinking, nor deduced truly from the general principle of the Hamiltonian logic. For it ought to have been kept in mind that extension is but an aspect of the notion, not a separable fact upon which the logical processes of elaboration are to be directed. It is, moreover, sufficiently clear that the relation of whole and part is far from exhausting or even adequately representing the relations in which things become for intelligence matters of cognition, and it is further evident that the procedure by which types of judgment are distinguished according to the total or partial reference to extension contained in them assumes a stage and amount of knowledge which is really the completed result of cognition, not that witn which it starts, or by which it proceeds.^[92. The extension of a notion has no numerical or quantitative definiteness. To formulate the judgment as expressing definite amounts of extension, therefore, presupposes complete empirical survey of what, by its very essence, remains incomplete. This is specially noteworthy in the case of Hamilton's particular judgments. A judgment such as only some A is all B assumes total and perfect knowledge of the whole spheres of A and B. It is in the strictest sense of the word universal. Hamilton, it may be added, finds it completely impossible to work out a coherent doctrine of syllogism from the point of view taken in the treatment of the judgment. ]

The utility of basing logical theorems on psychological premisses, a method involved in the procedure of most expositions of formal [9:14:800] logic, may well be matter of doubt. For psychology, as ordinarily conceived, has certainly close relations with logic, but in aim and in point of view is distinctly opposed or at all events subordinate to it. The psychological investigation of thought, if carried out consistently, must take one of two forms, either that of description, in which thought, like any other mental fact, is regarded ab extra as that upon which attention and observation are to be directed,—in which case therefore any relations of thoughts among themselves must be of such an external nature as can be presented in the field of observation; or that of genesis, development, in which the subjective processes of mind are viewed as forms of the one great process whereby knowledge is realized in the individual consciousness. Investigations from the first point of view are diametrically opposed to the logical treatment of thought, for in the latter the essential feature, the reference in the subject, with his mental forms, to an objective order within his experience is entirely wanting. Such investigation is abstract; it proceeds upon and remains within the limits of a distinction drawn in and for conscious experience, a distinction the grounds, significance, and modes of which require to be treated by a larger and more comprehensive method. Investigations from the second point of view are subordinate to logic in the wider sense, for the treatment of the subjective processes therein is illuminated and determined by the general principles regarding the nature and meaning of conscious experience which it is the sole function of logic to bring forward and establish. The psychology which Hamilton generally has in view is that commonly called empirical, and with his conception of it the two sciences, logic and psychology, are really one.

33. A possible exit from the difficulties or assumptions of the current Kantian logic may be sought by following out and consistently applying the hint contained in Kant’s distinction of analytic and synthetic thought, analytic and synthetic truth. It may be said that all thinking involves the fundamental laws of identity and non-contradiction; that in these laws only is to be found the characteristic and most general feature of thought; that in them only is the form, or element contributed by mind itself, to be-detected. Logic would thus be regarded as the explicit statement of the conditions of non-contradictoriness in thought, as the evolution of the formal element in thought, and, since in analytic truth only can non-contradictoriness be discovered without material aid, as the theory of analytic thought. Such is the position assigned to logic by Twesten, Mansel, Spalding, and some others, and the consequences to which it inevitably leads are sufficiently interesting to require that some special examination should be given to it.

In the first place, then, it seems evident that the fundamental distinction implied, that between analytic and synthetic thought, is wrongly conceived. That analysis and synthesis are methods of cognition, differing in many important respects, is undoubted; but such difference lies in a sphere altogether alien to that within which the present distinction is to be sought Analytic thought, as here conceived, is only to be understood when taken in reference to the judgment, and then also in reference to a peculiarity in the Kantian doctrine. Kant, emphasizing the principle that judgment is essentially the form in which the particular of experience is determined by the universal element of thought, but identifying this universal with a formed concept (resembling, therefore, a class notion), contemplated a class of judgments in which the predicate was merely an explication of the subject notion. Such judgments, had the matter been more fully considered, would have appeared as far from primary, and Kant has himself, in the most unambiguous language, indicated the correct view that analysis is consequent and dependent on synthesis,—that analytic judgments, therefore, are merely special applications of abstracting thought within a sphere already treated, handled, formed by thought. Mansel, too, whose views are generally acute if not profound, has signalized as the primitive unit of cognition the so-called psychological judgment, which is essentially synthetic in character. The logical judgment, in fact, about which his conception of logic centres, is recognized as a posterior act of reflexion, directed upon formed notions, and is not in any way to be regarded as containing what is a common, universal feature of all judgments.

In the second place, even granting what cannot be maintained, that the process of thought is mere explication of the content of previous knowledge, and that the theory of logic has to do with a comparatively small and subordinate portion of cognition, there is in such a principle no means of development. We may take up in succession class-notions, judgments, reasonings, and in relation to each reiterate, as the one axiom of logic, that the constituent elements shall be non-contradictory; but such a treatment is only possible in relation to a material already formed and organized. The utmost possible value being given to such a view, logic, under it, could be but a partial and inchoate doctrine.

Finally, there is involved in the doctrine of analytic thought and in the consequences to which attention will next be drawn â peculiar and one-sided conception of identity or of the principle of identity as an element in thought. Historically this conception has played a most important part: it lies at the root of all nominalist logic from Antisthenes downwards, and has found metaphysical expression of the most diverse kinds. That things are what they are is the odd fashion in which a well-nigh forgotten English writer states what is taken to be the universal foundation of all thought and knowledge.^[93. John Sergeant. See The Method to Science, by J. S-, 8vo, Lond., 1696, pp. 144,145. This curious book contains much interesting matter. ] The representatives of things in our subjective experience, the units of knowledge, may be called notions, and, accordingly, that each notion should be what it is appears as the corresponding logical axiom. The whole process of thought is therefore regarded as merely the explicit statement of what each notion is, and the separation of it by direct or indirect methods from all that it is not. The judgment, essentially the active movement of thought, is reduced to the mere expression of the identity of a notion, and in truth, were the doctrine consistently carried out, Antisthenes’s conclusion that the judgment is a fallacious and inept form of thought would be the necessary result. When such a conclusion is not drawn, its place is generally taken by much vague declamation regarding the limited, imperfect, and uncertain character of our knowledge, which is regarded as asymptotically approaching to the adequate determination of truth.

The conception which underlies this view is the abstract separation of thought from things which has been already noted, but the proximate principle is a deduction therefrom. Knowledge or thought is treated externally as a series of isolated units or parts, and the results of cognition—notions, judgments, and reasonings—are viewed as the constituent factors. Thus, e.g., when it is said that a judgment is the expression of an identity, there are possible only two modes of explanation,—the one, that the identity referred to is that between the original notion (subject) as unqualified by its predicates and the same as qualified, in which case manifestly the result of the judgment is taken as being its constituent essence; the other, that the identity is that of the applicability of distinct names to the same fact, in which case we accept without further inquiry and exclude from logical consideration the processes of thought by which the application of names is brought about, and assume as being the procedure of thought itself that which is its consequence. Under all circumstances, difference is as important an element as identity in the judgment, and to concentrate attention upon the identity is to take a one-sided and imperfect view.^[94. On Condillac’s attempt to treat judgments as identities for equations) some excellent remarks will be found in De Tracy. Idéologie, iii. 133-143, cf. Duhamel. De» Méthodes, L 89-94. ]

34. So soon, however, as the real nature of thought has been thrown out of account as not concerned in the processes of logic, so soon as the law of non-contradiction, in its manifold statement, has been formulated as the one principle of logical or formal thinking, there appears the possibility of evolving an exact system of the conditions of non-contradictoriness. The ultimate units of knowledge, whatsoever we call them, whether notions or ideas of classes or names, have at least one characteristic,—they are what they are, and therefore exclude from themselves whatever is contradictory of their nature. They are combined positions and negations, that which is posited or negated being left undetermined,—referred, in fact, to matter as opposed to form. With respect to any article of thought, therefore, the only logical requirement is that it shall possess the characteristic of not being self-contradictory, and the only logical question is, what exactly is posited and negated thereby. Complex articles of thought viewed in like manner as complexes of positions and negations may have the same condition demanded of them and the same question put regarding them. A judgment and a syllogism, if narrowly investigated, will appear to be merely complex articles of thought, complexes of positions and negations. Proceeding from such a conception there may be treatments more or less systematic and fruitful. In the hands of Kantian logicians, such as Twesten, Mansel, Spalding, and the like, little is effected, for, as the forms of thought are accepted as given and as having their characteristics otherwise fixed (by psychology or critical theory of knowledge), the treatment resolves itself either into repetition, in respect to each, of the fundamental logical condition, or into the erection of a specific kind of thought (analytical) which has no other feature save that of correspondence with the said condition. But it is clear that restriction by any psychological or critical doctrine of thought is an arbitrary limitation. It is needful only to regard the operation of thought as establishment of positions and negations, and to develop, by whatever method, the systematic results of such a view. Hobbes’s doctrine of thought as dealing with names and as essentially addition and subtraction of nameable features, Boole’s doctrine of thought as the determination of a class, Jevons’s view of thought as simple apprehension of qualities,—any of these will serve as starting point, for in all of them the fruitful element is the same. The further step that the generalization of the system of thought must take a symbolic form presents itself as an immediate and natural consequence.

35. By the application of a symbolic method is not to be understood what has been practised by many writers on logic—the illustration[9:14:801] of elementary logical relations by numerical or algebraic signs or by diagrammatic schemata. The expression has the signification which it bears in mathematical analysis, and implies that the general relations of dependence among objects of thought, of whatsoever kind, in correspondence with which operations of perfectly general character are carried out, shall be represented by symbols, the laws of which are determined by the nature of these relations or by the laws of the corresponding operations. The mere use of abbreviations for the objects of treatment is not the application of a symbolic method^[95. Thus one would not describe Aristotle's use of letters for the terms of his syllogisms, nor the current logical abbreviations of S, 1 ’, and M in like case as being, in any true sense of the word, symbolic. On the subject generally the instructive work of Mr Venn (Symbolic Logic, 1881) should be consulted' Mr Venn has not only in this work expounded the foundations and main theorems of Boole’s logic with a care and skill that leave nothing to be desh·ed, but he has independently of many real contributions to logical analysis, put in its true light the nature of symbolic method in logic. He has rendered it impossible, even for the outsider, to complain that symbolic logic is an arbitrary application of mathematical method to logical material. ]; but so soon as the general relations of, or general operations with, these objects are represented by symbols, and the laws of such symbols stated as deductions therefrom, there arises the possibility of a symbolic development or method of treatment, which may lead to more or less expanded results according as the significance of the symbolic laws is more or less general. Thus <[uantity, whether discrete or continuous, presents, as an aspect of phenomena, relations of a highly general kind, offers itself as object of operations of a highly general kind, and is therefore peculiarly the subject of symbolic treatment. Currently, indeed, the treatment of quantity is assumed to have the monopoly of symbolism, but such an assumption is not self-evidently true, and it is permissible to inquire whether matters non-quantitative do not present relations of such generality that they, too, can be symbolically dealt with. It is, however, a further question whether the generality of the relations and therefore the significance of the symbols in such cases, although subject to some special conditions not necessarily involved in the nature of quantity, do not spring from the fact that we treat the matters as quantities of a special kind, and so insensibly find ourselves applying quantitative methods. In other words, it remains to be investigated, after the preliminary definitions and. axioms of any symbolic method have been laid down, whether the conception of thought with which we start, or a special feature distinctly quantitative in character, has been the truly fruitful element in after-development of the system.^[96. An excellent note on symbolic logic will be found in Lotze, Logik (2d ed.. 1880) pp. 256-59. ]

The first step in any symbolic logic must evidently be the determination of the nature and laws of the symbols, and, as these follow from the nature of the operations of thought, the first step is likewise a statement of the essential characteristic of thinking. As above noted, there have been adopted various modes of expressing this characteristic, and in some cases the mode adopted is not one from which any generally applicable symbolic rules of procedure could have followed.^[97. Some of tl>ese, as, e.g.. Lambert's and Ploucquet’s, are noted and discussed by Mr Venn 'Symbo , ic Logic, xxxii.-xxxvi. and passim). ] Two only require here to be noted, as representing special views: first, that which proceeds from the idea of thought as essentially the process of grouping, classing, determining a definite set of objects by a mark or notion; and second, that which proceeds more generally from the conception of thought as consisting of a series of self-identical units, to be variously combined in obedience to the law of self-identity.^[98. The first is the view taken by Boole (and expounded with great fulness in V enn, as_above); the second is that of the brothers Grassmann (in the Formenlehre, 1872, especially bk. ii. Die Begriffslehre oder Logik). ] Adopting the first view, we find that processes capable of symbolic representation, by the customary algebraic signs of addition, subtraction, equivalence, multiplication, and division, have a perfectly general significance in reference to the combination, separation, equalization of classes, to the imposition and removal of restriction on a class; that to the symbols there can therefore be assigned a set of general laws; and that any peculiarity of these symbolic laws which differentiates them from the laws of like symbols in mathematical analysis is deducible from the notion of thought with which we started, and is consequently to be carried along with them in all the after development. Symbolic representation of relations of classes follows with equal directness from the general notion that by any such relation a new group is determined in reference to the original groups, or rather that the position or negation of a new group (or series of groups) is given, definitely or indefinitely, as the result of such a relation.

With the aid of the symbolic laws so reached, the logical problem as such may then be approached. Given any number of logical terms (t.e., classes, or, as it may be better put, positions and negations) connected together by any relations, to determine completely any one in reference to the others, or to express any one in terms of the others. The symbolic procedure, expounded with marvellous ingenuity and success by Boole, may take various forms, and may be simplified by many analytical devices, but consists essentially in determining systematically how given positions and negations, definite or indefinite, combine with or neutralize one another. A more detailed account of these formal processes is beyond our limits.^[99. Mr Venn’s work is here again invaluable. Jevons’s Principiet of Science and Studies in Deductive Logic should be consulted. Schroder’s Operationskreis des Logikkalculs contains some very elegant and simple methods. ]

The first question which suggests itself in connexion with Boole’s symbolic logic is the necessity or advisability of retaining the reference to classes, or the description of thought as classification. Do the symbolic laws really depend to any extent on the logical peculiarities of class arrangement? Mr Venn, who emphasizes this feature in Boole’s scheme, has, however, done good service in leading up to a different explanation. The general reference to objects, which is also noted as implied in all Boole’s formulae, has nothing to do with the possible difference of conceptualist or materialist doctrines of the proposition, and, in fact, as all distinctions of thing and quality, resemblance and difference, higher and lower, subject and predicate vanish, or are absorbed in the more general principle underlying the symbolic method, phrases such as classification, extension, intension, and the like should be banished as not pertinent. Nay, the usual distinctions of quantity and even of quality either disappear or acquire a new significance when they are brought under the scope of the new principle. “What symbolic logic works upon by preference is a system of dichotomy, of x and not z, y and not y, and so forth.”^[100. Venn, as above, p. 162. ] In other words, quantitative differences require to find expression through some combination of the positions and negations of the elements making up the objects dealt with,^[101. where this is impossible, as in the case of the truly particular or indeter minate judgment, symbolic methods encounter almost insurmountable difficulties. ] while the usual qualitative distinctions are merged in the position or negation of various combinations.

The whole phraseology then of classification and its allied processes seems needless when used to denote the simple determination of objects thought. The literal signsexpress, not “classes,” but units, determined in and for thought as self-identical. For this reason then it appears that the view of the foundations of the symbolic methods of logic taken in Grassmann’s Begriffslehre is more thoroughgoing, and more closely represents the underlying principles, than that involved in Boole’s formulae and expounded in detail by Mr Venn.

Grassmann, as above stated, deduces logical relations as a particular class of the determinations necessarily attaching to all quantities (t.e., determined contents of thought). Abstraction being made of all peculiarities which may be due to their special constitution, quantities exhibit certain formal relations when they are combined (added, subtracted, &c.). Each quantity is a unit of thought, a definite positum, and of such units there are but two classes, elements and complexes. Units of thought, which are self-identical, and therefore subject to the specific law that addition of each to itself or multiplication of it by itself yields as result only the original unit, are notions. The theory of notions, therefore, is the development of the general formal relations of units under the special restrictions imposed by their nature.^[102. See Die Begriffslehre oder Logik (1872), p. 43. Schröder (op. cit.) follows Grassmann, though with the use of class phraseology. ]

There appears very clearly in Grassmann’s treatment the essence of the principle on which symbolic logic proceeds. Thought is viewed as simply the process of positing and negating definite contents or units, and the operations of logic become methods for rendering explicit that which is in each case posited or negated. To apply symbolic methods, we require units as definite as those of quantitative science, and the only laws we can employ are those which spring from the nature of units as definite. Now it seems a profound error to reduce the whole complex process of thinking to this reiterated position of self-identical units. Undoubtedly if we start from any given fact of thought, as, e.g., a judgment, and inquire what can be exhibited as involved in it, we have before us a problem of analysis, the solution of which must take form in a series of positions and negations, but our thinking is not therefore as a whole mere analysis. The synthetic process by which connexions of thought among the objects of our conscious experience are established is not the mechanical aggregation of elementary parts. The relations which give intelligible significance to our experience are not simply those of identity and non·identity. It is an altogether abstract and external view of thought, resting in all probability on an obscure metaphysical principle,^[103. As above noted, p. 800. ] that would treat it as in essence the composition and decomposition of elementary atoms, of ττρωra, as Antisthenes would have called them. It has, indeed, been imagined that a symbolic loric might be developed which should be independent in all its fundamental axioms of any metaphysical or psychological assumptions, but this is an illusion. No logical method can be developed save from a most definite conception of the essential nature and modus operandi of thinking, and any system of symbolic logic finds it necessary, if it is to be complete and consistent, to adopt some such view as that above criticized, to regard thought as purely analytic, as dealing with compounds or [9:14:802] units which are themselves highly complex products, only to be formed by a kind of thought not recognized among logical processes.^[104. The same fact has been noted in regard to formal logic of the Kantian school, as, 2¾ , m Ma '~o el s distinction of psychological and logical judgments. ]

36. Formal logic, then, in the ordinary acceptation of that term, does not appear to furnish any adequate representation of the real process and method of thought. Any logical theory must of necessity be formal, ι.e., abstract or general, for it can consider only the general elements of thought, not specific knowledge in which are involved the finite, limited relations of one fact or class of facts to another. The distinction between logic and the sciences is therefore precisely that between philosophy in general and the sciences. Attempts have been made to include in logical analysis the treatment of scientific method, i.e., to discuss as matter of logic the varied processes by which scientific results have been attained. It is true that logical consideration must extend to the notions through which scientific experience, like any other, becomes intelligible, and, in so far as scientific method is but the application of the laws of knowledge as a whole, it is a possible, nay necessary, object of logical treatment. But to include scientific methodology in particular, the consideration of the mechanical devices by which we strive to bring experience into conformity with our ideal of cognition, the discussion of methods of experiment and observation, under the one head logic is an error in principle, whether we view logic in its theoretical aspect or in reference to a special propaedeutic aim. Generalizations on such topics are well-nigh worthless; they can have vitality and importance only when drawn in closest conjunction with actual scientific work. The theory of scientific method is either doctrine of knowledge treated freely or else the application of thought in connexion with actual research and the ascertainment of the principles therein employed. In either case it is not susceptible of abstraction and isolated treatment.

37. There remains only, of the possible views noted, that which identified logic with the theory of knowledge, but which so defined theory of knowledge as to distinguish it from metaphysics. The designation of logic as theory of knowledge is one to which in words there can be no possible objection. It brings into the foreground what it has been the object of this article, by an historico-critical survey, to establish, that so-called logical laws, forms, and problems are hardly capable of statement, certainly incapable of satisfactory treatment, except in the most intimate connexion with the principles of a theory of knowledge. To include, however, in the signification of this latter term a peculiar conception of the relation between thinking (knowing) and reality is at once to restrict the scope of logic and to place an arbitrary and, one would say, an ill-founded restriction on the kind of treatment to which logical problems may be subjected. If it be really the function of logic to trace the forms and laws of knowledge, that function is all-comprehensive, and must embrace in its scope all the fundamental characteristics of experience as known. But no characteristic of experience is more palpable than the distinction, drawn within conscious experience, between knowledge and reality. It is impossible then for a theory of knowledge to start with the assumption that these two exist separately, constituted each after its special fashion, but with a certain parallelism between them. In words one may refer for justification of the assumption to metaphysics, or to psychology, but, in fact, the problem so relegated to some other discipline is essentially a logical question, and the method of its solution exactly that which must be applied in the treatment of subordinate logical questions. Practical convenience alone can lead to any separation of the problems which under this view are referred in part to theory of knowledge and in part to metaphysics. Other and more serious difficulties of the view have been already commented on.^[105. ⅜Doyc, p. 7V7. ]

38. In sum, then, the problems and the methods which compose logic in the strictest sense of that term seem to be one with the problems and methods of the critical theory of knowledge. No other title describes so appropriately as that of “logical” the analysis of knowledge as. such, its significance and constitution, in opposition to the quasi-historical or genetic account for which the title psychological should be retained. The researches to which we would here assign the title “logical” undoubtedly include all that can supply the place of the older metaphysic, but in aim and method are so distinct that the same title cannot be borne by both. To assign so extensive a range to logical investigations enables us to see that the criteria by which at one time or another a narrower province was determined for logic are but partial expressions of the whole truth. The analysis of knowledge as such, the complete theory of the intelligible elements in conscious experience, does hold a . s P e . cιa ^ relation to. all other subordinate branches of human thinking, whether philosophic in the ordinary sense of that term or scientific. According as one or other aspect of this relation is made prominent, there comes forward one or other of the various modes for settling the province of logic; but these partial concep tions prove their inadequacy when development is attempted from them, and within the systems constructed in accordance with them there is of necessity continuous reference to inquiries lying beyond the prescribed limits.

A certain analysis of some methods of ordinary thinking, based to a very large extent on language, and resembling in many respects grammatical study, has long been current in educational practice as logic, and to those whose conception of the subject has been formed from acquaintance with this imperfect body of rules and formulae it may appear a violent and unnecessary extension of the term to apply it to the all-comprehensive theory of knowledge. The reasons, however, are imperative; and, as these would lead one to deny the right of this elementary practical discipline to the possession of the title, it is desirable to conclude by offering a single remark on the place and function of this currently designated logic.

Not much trouble is required in order to see that the ordinary school or formal logic can lay no claim to scientific completeness. Its principles are imperfect, dubious, and most variously conceived; it possesses no method by which development from these principles is possible; it has no criterion by which to test the adequacy of its abstract forms as representations of the laws of concrete thinking. Accordingly it is handled, in whole and in detail, in the most distractingly various fashion, and were it indeed entitled to the honourable designation of logic the prospects of that science might well be despaired of. But in fact the school logic discharges a function for which exhaustiveness of logical analysis is not a requisite. It has a raison dètrc in the circumstance that training to abstract methods must needs be a graduated process, and that, whether as a means towards the prosecution of philosophic study in especial, or as instrument of general educational value, practice in dealing with abstract thoughts must have value. Such elementary practice naturally bases itself on the kinds of distinction apparent in the concrete thinking of those to whom it is applied, and for this reason school logic not only connects itself with and is in a sense the development of grammar and grammatical analysis and synthesis, but may, to a limited extent, include reference to some of the simpler processes of scientific method. In all probability the discord observable among the ordinary treatises on school logic is due to the want of recognition of the true place which can thus be assigned to the subject treated. The doctrine has a propaedeutic but not a scientific value.

Note a. Histories of Logic.— No complete history of logic, apart from philosophy inj general, exists; but of the Aristotelian logic, in its system and in its development throughout the ancient and mediaeval epochs we possess a most adequate history in Prantl·s Geschichte der Logik im Abendlande (i., 1855; ii., 1861; iii., 1867; iv., 1870), extending to the close of the mediaeval period.

The following are some of the more important contributions towards a history ot logic, whether in independent works or in portions of systematic treatises; most oι them, indeed, of small value Ramus, Scholae Dialecticae, bk. i. chaps. 1-8; Keckermann, Systema Logicae, 1598; Gassendi, Opera, i. 35-66; Fabricius, Specimen elenchicum historiae logicae, 1699; walch, Parerga Academica (1721), pp. 453-848; Darjes, Via ad Veritatem, appendix, 1755; Buhle, in Commentât. Soc. Gotting., vol. x.; Fülleborn, Beiträge z. Gesch. d. Phil. (1794), pt. iv. pp. 160-80; Eberstein, Gesch. d. Logik u. Metaphysik bei den Deutschen von Leibnitz bis auf gegenwärtige Zeit (2d ed., 1794), useful as a survey of the wolflian logics; Calker, Denklehre (1822), pp. 12-198; Bachmann, System der Logik (1828), pp. 569-644; Mussmann, De Logicae ac Dialecticae notione historica, 1828; Troxler, Logik (1830), vol. iii.; Sigwart, De historia logicae inter Graecos usque ad Socratem, 1832; St Hilaire, De la Logique d’Aristote (1838), ii. pp. 93-312; Franck, Esquisse d’une histoire de la logique, 1838; Reiffenberg, Principes de logique, 1839 (with bibliography); Trendelenburg, Gesch. d. Kategorienlehre, 1846; Blakey, History of Logic, and Essay on Logic (2d ed., 1848), with bibliographical appendix; Hoffmann, Grundzüge einer Geschichte der Begriff der Logik in Deutschland von Kant bis Baader, 1851; K. Fischer, Logik u. Metaphysik (2d ed., 1865), pp. 16-182, a valuable critique of some modern doctrines; Rabus, Logik und Metaphysik (1868), i. pp. 123-242, excellent; Ueberweg, System der Logik (4th ed., 1874), pp. 15-66, excellent critical account; Ragnisco, Storia critica delle Kategorie, 1871, 2 vols.; Rabus, Die neuesten Bestrebungen auf dem Gebiete der Logik bei den Deutschen, 1880; Harms, Geschichte der Logik, 1881; Venn, Symbolic Logic, 1881 (introduction, and pp. 405-444), a valuable contribution to the history and bibliography of the application of symbolic methods in logic. The only good bibliography of logic is that given by Rabus in his Logik u. Metaphysik, ∙i. pp. 453-518. Some of the older lexicons, e.g., Lipenius, Bibliotheca Bealis (1685), s. vv. “Logica,” “Organon,” ‘'Dialectica,” contain great store of bibliographical references. A complete bibliography is a desideratum.

Note B.

Hindu Systems of Logic.— In almost all the Hindu systems of philosophy, as these are classified by the most recent authorities, indications are to be found of a more or less developed analysis of the process or method of reasoning, and therefore of a certain amount of logical theory. In two systems in particular the logical element is the most prominent feature. The Nyâya, or logical doctrine of Gotama, is in a very special sense the Hindu logic, while in the Vaiseschika, or Atomist system of Kanada, there are many expansions of or additions to the Nyâya, though the prevailing interest is not logical.

The most accessible sources of information regarding the Hindu logic, Colebrooke’s Essays, and Professor Μ. Muller’s abstract (in the appendix to Archbishop Thomson’s Laws of Thought), tend to mingle in an undesirable fashion what is special to the Nyâya doctrine, and what is added by Kanada and his followers. In order to appreciate the extent to which thé analysis of reasoning has been carried in these early systems, it is advisable to restrict attention to the original exposition of the Nyâya.

The aim of Nyâya is the attainment of perfection, of bliss, through knowledge. _ But, to have knowledge in a systematic and complete fashion, it is requisite that the individual should know (or should be capable of organizing [9:14:803] his knowledge in reference to) the sixteen great topics or heads of discussion. These, as enumerated by Gotama are-(l) proof; (2) the objects of proof; (3) doubt; (4) motive; (5) the iUustration or example for discussion; (6) the final assertion; (7) the enumeration of the five members of the final assertion; (8) confirmatory argument; (9) the conclusion, the defined judgment; (10) the objection; (11) controversy; (12) deceptive counter argument; (13) apparent reason or sophism; (14) fraud or wilfully deceptive argument, ruse; (15) futile argument or self-contradictory counter argument; (16) conclusive refutation. Inspection of these at once shows that they represent stages in dialectic or in the process of clearing up knowledge by discussion. The generalia, i.e., the kinds of proof, described as four in number—sense-perception inference (either from cause to effect, from effect to cause, or from comm∣lnity of nature, i.e., in a wide sense, analogy), comparison (analogy in a stricter significance), tradition,—and the things about which proof may be exercised, under which a twelvefold division is given by Gotama, and enlarged in endless detail by his commentators, who introduce thereunder much of Kanada’s system, are first laid down as the basis for the whole. Then follows (Nos. 3-6) the progress from doubt, which first calls for reasoning or proof, through motive, to position of the problem in the form of an example or case, and to the general assertion, as having valid grounds. The analysis of the grounds of assertion is then given, and here we have what corresponds more particularly to the syllogism as known to us. Five members are signalized (1) the thesis or proposition to be proved; (2) the reason, or intermediate ground by which the subject of the proposition is linked onto an explanatory principle; (3) the explanatory principle; (4) the application of this explanatory principle; (5) the statement of the conclusion as following from the application. Thus, in the example usually given—(1) thesis, this mountain is fiery; (2) intermediate ground, because it smokes; (3) explanatory principle, whatever smokes is fiery, as, for instance, a hearth; (4) application, therefore this mountain is fiery; (5) statement of conclusion, the mountain, then, is fiery, because it smokes. There can be no doubt that in this somewhat unsystematic arrangement we have the outlines of syllogistic argument. Considerable obscurity, however, rests over the third member, and it is only partially cleared up when we proceed to the next topic, which may perhaps be translated confirmatory argument. Here the essence of the argument appears to be a regress from the known mark to the fundamental quality from which it follows. Thus, e.σ., if it were said the mountain is not fiery, then the argument would be adduced, but the mountain smokes, and what is not fiery does not smoke. Apparently there is involved the assumption that the mark is a necessary consequence of the primary quality, but the exposition is obscure, and, doubtless, connects itself with the principles of causal connexion recognized by Hindu thinkers. (See williams, as below, pp. 73-4).

When the conclusion has thus been confirmed, when the negation of the ground has been shown to fail in explaining the observed fact, the thesis may be stated in an absolute and definitive form (topic 9). The remaining seven topics are then concerned with the discussion which may arise when an opponent brings forward objections to the conclusion. This he must do by positing his antithesis (10), whereupon issue may be joined (11). Should the adversary be unable to establish his antithesis, he may resort to deceit, bringing forward arguments, illogically arranged and devoid of force (12), which soon leads to the employment of sophisms (13) or merely apparent arguments, and even to deceitful ruses (14). Under these topics the Nydya signalizes and discusses various well-known forms of faUacy. The destruction of all these fallacious arguments reduces the opponent to the employment of futile, irrelevant responses, which undermine his own position (15), and the exposure of which completes his discomfiture and reduces him to silence (16).

Expositions of this dialectic system are not yet available in such kind and amount as would enable one to do full justice to it. Evidently much patience and a very considerable knowledge of the current philosophical view would be requisite in order to appreciate at their true worth many apparently formal, and in some cases dubious, divisions. Of accounts which may be consulted the following seem the more important Colebrooke’s Essays on the Religion and Philosophy of the Hindus, from which the expositions in Ritter (Ges. d. Phil., iv..382 sg.), Hegel (Werke, xiii. 161-167), and Cousin (Histoire Générale, Leçon ii.) are taken; Ward’s Account of the History, Literature, and Religion of the Hindoos (4 vols. 1811; later editions, with title altered, in 1815, 1817, 1821); Windischmann, Philosophie im Fortgang der Weltgeschichte (1834), specially pp. 1895-1920; Μ. Miiller, appendix to Thomson s Laws of Thought·, Rosenkranz, Die Modificationen der Logik (1846), pp. 184-97; Williams, Indian Wisdom, pp. 71-88; St Hilaire, articles “Indiens," “Gotama,” “Nyäya,” “Kanada,” in the Dictionnaire Philosophique, and translation, with commentary, of part of Gotama , s “Sûtras,” in the Mémoires de l' Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, tom. iii.

Note C.

Ramus.— The logical theories of Ramus acquired for a brief period a factitious importance from ,their connexion with the general revolt against Aristotelianism, and with the Protestant struggle against the Roman Catholic authority. In themselves they have no particular value, nor indeed much originality, and the exposition of them by their author, always rather literary than philosophic, adds nothing of strength or interest. In comparison with the Aristotelian analysis of the forms and methods of thinking, the few alterations of statement, and genera∏y the thin residuum of logical theory, which characterize Ramist work, appear as singularly insignificant. Nor have any of the special peculiarities of the Ramist logic exercised influence on the history of logical doctrines. The keenness of the controversy which raged in so many of the centres of learning between the Aristotelians and the total or partial Ramists is explicable only as having reference to differences which were merely symbolized by the apparent difference in logical doctrine.

In the Protestant universities and seminaries generally the Ramist logic obtained, and for some time kept, a firm footing. In Scotland, through Melville, Buchanan, and the earl of Murray, who had been a pupil of Ramus, his system was installed as the orthodox staple of logical training, and such records as remain of Scottish university education during the troubled 16th century would undoubtedly exhibit the traces of this new movement. In England, Cambridge alone, always disposed to reject the authority of Aristotle, and generally more open to new ideas than the sister university, was a stronghold of Ramism, and, apart from special works of Ramist tendency, the influence of the new doctrine is discernible in the writings of more than one Cambridge alumnus. William Temple, a friend of Sir Philip Sidney, and an official of the university, published a volume of Scholia in Rami Dialecticam, 1591; George Downam, praelector on logic, wrote commentaries In Petri Rami Dialecticam, 1606; and Milton, in 1672, expanded the Dialectica in his Artis Logicae Plenior Institutio. Marlowe’s Faustus, and his Massacre qf St Bartholomew, show how familiar Ramist phraseology and the personality of Ramus must have been to an alumnus of Cambridge, while Bacon, with well-grounded objection to much of the Ramist method, expounds the system of logic with unmistakable reference to the Ramist principles and method of arrangement. There is a monograph on Ramus by Ch. Waddington with a good bibliography— Ramus (Pierre de la Ramée) : sa Vie, see Écrits, et ses Opinions, Paris, 1856—and a slighter work, mainly biographical, by Ch. Desmaze (P. Ramus, Professeur au Collège de France: sa Vie, ses Écrits, sa Mort, 1515-72, Paris, 1864). In Lipenius (Bibliotheca Realis, s. v. “Ramus”) will be found a long list of writings for and against the Ramist logic. The history of the movement is also given in Buhle (Gesch. d. neuem Phil., ii. 680-702), Tennemann (Gesch. d. Phil., ix. pp. 420-42), Du Boulay (His. Univer. Paris, tom. iv.), Crevier (His. de VUniυ. de Paris, vol. v.), in Jo. Hermannus ab Elswich (Schediasma de varia Aristotelis in scholis Protestantiumfortuna, §§ 21-29), De Launoy (De Varia Aristot. in Acad. Paris, fortuna, cap. χiii.), and in Bayle (Dictionnaire, s. v. “Ramus”). (R. AD.)
