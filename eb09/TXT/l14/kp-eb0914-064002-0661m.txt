LILBURNE, John (1618-1657), an English sectary and prolific pamphleteer, was the younger son of a gentleman of good family in the county of Durham, and was born in 1618. At the age of twelve he was apprenticed to a clothier in London, but he appears to have paid only slight attention to business, and to have early addicted himself to the “contention, novelties, opposition of government, and violent and bitter expressions” for which he afterwards became so conspicuous as to provoke the saying of Marten that, “if the world was emptied of all but John Lilburn, Lilburn would quarrel with John, and John with Lilburn.” He appears at one time to have been law-clerk to Prynne. In February 1638, for the part he had taken in importing and circulating the Merry Litany and other publications of Bastwick and Prynne, offensive to the bishops, he was sentenced to be publicly whipped from the Fleet prison to Palace Yard, Westminster, there to stand for two hours in the pillory, and afterwards to be kept in jail until a fine of £500 had been paid. Though gagged at the pillory, and confined in prison, he was not the man to give up his opinions or forego the pleasure of expressing them, and in the following year he did not improve his prospects of a speedy release by the kind of literary activity to which he devoted his enforced leisure.^[1. Come out of Her, My People: or An Answer to the Questions of α Gentlewoman, a professor in the Anti-Christian Church of England, about Hearing the public Ministers; where it is largely discussed, and proved to be unlawful. Also a Just Apology for the way of Total Separation, commonly but falsely called “Brownisrn”; that it is the truth of God though lightly esteemed in the eyes of the world. With a challenge to dispute them publicly before King and Council, to prove whatsoever I have said at the pillory against them: viz., that the calling of them is jure Diaboli, even from the Devil himself. By me John Dilburne, close prisoner in the Fleet for the cause of Christ. Printed in the year of hope of England's Purgation and the Prelates' Dissolu-t'on, 1639. ] In point of fact he did not regain his liberty until November 7, 1640, when one of the earliest recorded speeches of Oliver [9:14:641] Cromwell was made in support of his petition to the House of Commons. In 1641 he received an indemnity of £3000. He now entered the army, and in 1642 was taken prisoner at Brentford and tried for his life; sentence would no doubt have been executed had not the parliament by threatening reprisals forced his exchange. He soon rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel, but in April 1645, having become dissatisfied with the general conduct of affairs, and especially with the predominance of Presbyterianism, he resigned his commission, presenting at the same time to the Commons a petition for considerable arrears of pay. His violent language in Westminster Hall about the speaker and other public men led in the following July to his arrest and committal to Newgate, whence he was discharged, however, without trial, by order of the House, in October. In January 1647 he was again committed to the Tower for accusations which he had brought against Cromwell, but was again set at liberty in time to become a disappointed spectator of the failure of the levelling or ultrademocratic party in the army at the Ware rendezvous in the following December. The scene produced a deep impression on his mind, and in February 1649 he along with other petitioners presented to the House of Commons a paper entitled The Serious Apprehensions of a part of the People on behalf of the Commonwealth, which he followed up with a pamphlet, England's New Chains Discovered (March 1, 1649), criticizing Ireton, and another exposing the conduct of Cromwell, Ireton, and other leaders of the army since June 1647 {The Hunting of the Poxes from Newmarket and Triploe Heath to Whitehall by Five Small Beagles, the “beagles” being Lilburne, Overton, Walwyn, Prince, and another). Finally, the Second Part of England's New Chains Discovered, a violent outburst against “the dominion of a council of state, and a constitution of a new and unexperienced nature,” became the subject of discussion in the House, and led anew to the imprisonment of its author in the Tower on April 11. His trial in the following October, on a charge of seditious and scandalous practices against the state, resulted in his unanimous acquittal, followed by his release in November. In January 1652, for printing and publishing a petition against Sir Arthur Hasilrig and the Haberdasher’s Hall for what he conceived to have been an injury done to his uncle George Lilburne in 1649, he was sentenced to pay fines amounting to £7000, and moreover to be banished the Commonwealth, with prohibition of return under the pain of death. In June 1653 he nevertheless came back from the Low Countries, where he had busied himself during the interval in pamphleteering and such other agitation as was possible, and was immediately arrested; the trial, which was protracted from July 13 to August 20, indeed issued in his acquittal, to the great joy of London, but it was nevertheless thought proper to keep him in captivity for “the peace of the nation.” He was detained successively in the Tower, in a castle at Jersey, and in Dover Castle. At Dover he came under Quaker influence, and signified his readiness at last to be done with “carnal sword fightings and fleshly bustlings and contests”; and in 1656, on giving security for his good behaviour, he was set free. He now settled at Eltham in Kent, frequently preaching at Quaker meetings in the place and neighbourhood during the brief remainder of his troubled life. He died on August 29, 1657.

See Masson, Life of Milton, who refers (iv. 120) also to Walker (History of Independency, ii. 247), Godwin (Commonwealth, iii. 163-177), and Bisset (Omitted Chapters of the History of England, 191-251), and adds, “Mr Bisset relates Lilburne’s trial (in 1649) at length, with copious extracts, and makes John more of a hero than Godwin does, though Godwin is not unfavourable. On the whole, I like him myself, and am glad that he is in the history of England, but think he was an ass.”
