LELAND, John (1691—1766), a polemical theologian of the 18th century, was born at Wigan, Lancashire, in 1691, and was educated in Dublin, where he made such progress in theological and other studies that in 1716, without having attended any college or hall, he was appointed first assistant and afterwards sole pastor of a congregation of Presbyterians in New Row. This office he continued to fill until his death on January 16, 1766.

Leland’s first publication was A Defence of Christianity (1733), in reply to Tindal’s Christianity as Old as the Creation ; it was succeeded by ∖∖∖α Divine Authority of the Old and New Testaments asserted (1738), in answer to The Moral Philosopher of Morgan; in 1741 he published two volumes, in the form of two letters, being Remarks on [H. Dodwell’s] Christianity not Founded on Argument·, and in 1753 Reflexions on the Late Lord Bolingbroke's Letters on the Study and Use of History. A View of the Principal Deistical Writers that have appeared in England was published in 1754-56. This is the only work of the author—“most worthy, painstaking, and commonplace of divines,” as he has recently been styled—which can now be said to have any present value. This value, however, is purely historical; his facts about the deists are interesting and useful, but it may be safely conjectured that no one now reads his (doubtless sincere) arguments, here and elsewhere, against the creed he opposed without some sense of their hollowness, contradictoriness, and obvious unfairness. His latest work was a treatise entitled The Advantage and Necessity of the Christian Revelation [9:14:434] shown from the Slate of Religion in the Ancient Heathen World. Discourses on various Subjects, with a Life prefixed, was published posthumously, 4 vols. 8vo, 1768-89; also a Life by Huddesford, 1772.
