LEWES, a market-town and parliamentary borough, and the county town of Sussex, England, is situated on the river Ouse, at the junction of a number of railway lines, 50 miles south of London, and 7 north of Newhaven, which is its port. It occupies the slope of one of the chalk hills, and consists principally of one main street with smaller and narrower ones at right angles. St Michael’s church, restored in 1878, is without architectural merit, but possesses some old brasses and monuments; St Anne’s church is a very ancient structure in the Early English style; St Thomas at-Cliffe, in the Perpendicular style, was [9:14:491] erected in the 15th century; St John’s, Southover, is of mixed architecture, but preserves some specimens of Early Norman. There are only slight remains of the old castle, occupying a picturesque situation on the height, and supposed to have been founded by Alfred and rebuilt by William de Warren. In the grounds of the old Cluniac priory of St Paneras, founded in 1078, the leaden coffins of William de Warren and Gundrada were dug up during an excavation in 1845. There is a free grammar school dating from 1512, and among the other public buildings are the county-hall, the prison, and the Fitzroy memorial library. The industries include the manufacture of agricultural implements, brewing, tanning, and iron and brass founding. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 6010, and in 1881 it was 6017, the population of the parliamentary borough (area 1087 acres) in the same years being 10,753 and 11,199. Lewes was incorporated by royal charter in 1881.

From various discoveries that have been made of Roman coins, and the traces that still remain of old mounds and tumuli, the town is believed to be of very ancient origin. It was a royal demesne of the South Saxon kings. Mints were established at it by Athelstan, which were in operation till the reign of Harold. At the battle of Lewes, May 13, 1264, Simon de Montfort defeated Henry III. From the time of Edward I. until 1868 the town returned two members to parliament, but now it returns only one.
