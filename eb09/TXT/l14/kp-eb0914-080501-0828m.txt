LOGRONO, an inland province of Spain, the smallest of the eight modern divisions of Old Castile, is bounded on the N. by Burgos, Alava, and Navarre, on the E. by Navarre and Zaragoza, on the S. by Soria, and on the W. by Burgos. The area is 1945 square miles, with a population in 1877 of 174,425. It belongs entirely to the basin of the river Ebro, which forms its northern boundary except for a short distance near San Vicente, and is now navigable throughout the entire length of the province; its drainage takes place chiefly by the rivers Tiron, Oja, Najerilla, Iregua, Leza, Cidacos, and Alhama, all flowing in a north-easterly direction. The portion skirting the Ebro forms a spacious and for the most part fertile undulating plain, called La Rioja in its western part; but in the south Logrono is considerably broken up by offshoots from the sierras which separate that river from the Douro. In the east the Cerro de Lorenzo rises to a height of about 7725 feet, and in the south the Pico Santa Ines is upwards of 7380 feet. The mineral resources, which are believed to be considerable, are as yet undeveloped. The products of the province are chiefly cereals, good oil and wine (especially in the Rioja), fruit (except oranges and lemons), silk, flax, and honey. The industries, which are unimportant, include spinning and weaving. Logrono is traversed by the Ebro valley railway, which connects Miranda del Ebro with Zaragoza; on this line are situated all the towns of the province with a population exceeding 5000â€”Haro, Logrono, Calahorra, and Alfaro.

LogkoSo, capital of the above province, is situated on the right bank of the Ebro, which is here crossed by a handsome stone bridge of twelve arches, dating from 1138; the surrounding plain is well cultivated and fertile, producing the rich Rioja wine. The city is the seat of the usual provincial authorities, civil and military. It has a theatre, and several hospitals and convents. The parish church claims great antiquity. The population in 1877 was 13,393; the trade and industries are unimportant.

The district of Logrono was in ancient times inhabited by the Berones or Verones of Strabo and Pliny, and their Varia is to be identified with the modern suburb of the city of Logrono now known as Varea or Barea. The place fell into the hands of the Moors in the 8th century, but was speedily retaken by the Christians, and under the name of Lucronius appears with frequency in mediaevai history. Logrono was the birthplace of the painter Navarrete (el Mudo) and of Espartero; the latter died there on January 9, 1879.
