LEWIS, Meriwether (1774-1809), American explorer, was born near Charlottesville, Virginia, August 18, 1774. In 1794 he volunteered with the troops called out to suppress the “whisky insurrection,” was commissioned as ensign in the regular army in 1795, and as captain in 1800, and was President Jefferson’s private secretary from 1801 to 1803. On Jefferson’s recommendation he was appointed by Congress to conduct, in connexion with Captain William Clarke, an expedition to the headwaters of the Missouri river, and thence across the mountains to the Pacific Ocean—the first extended exploration of the north-western portion of the *United States. The States had as yet acquired no claim to this region, and the exploration was designed by Jefferson in the interests not only of geographical science but of territorial acquisition. Lewis and Clarke, setting out late in 1803 with twenty-eight men, spent the winter at the mouth of the Missouri. Early in the spring the party embarked in several boats, and during the summer made the difficult ascent of the Missouri as far as 47° 2Γ N. lat., where the second winter was passed among the Mandan Indians. In 1805 the ascent of the Missouri was continued as far as the tributary which they named Jefferson river, which was followed to its source in the south-western part of what is now Montana territory. Procuring a guide and horses from the Shoshone Indians, they pushed westward through the mountains, and on October 7 embarked in canoes on a tributary of the Columbia river, the mouth of which they reached on November 15. They had travelled upwards of 4000 miles from their starting point, had encountered various Indian tribes never before seen by whites, had made scientific collections and observations, and were the first explorers to reach the Pacific by crossing the continent north of Mexico. After spending the winter upon the Columbia, they made the return journey across the mountains and down the Missouri, reaching the Mississippi in September 1806. The reports of the Lewis and Clarke expedition attracted great attention at the time, and it has scarcely been exceeded in romantic interest by later explorations in any quarter of the globe. The leaders and men of the exploring party were rewarded with liberal grants of land, and Lewis was made governor of the territory of Missouri. In the unwonted quiet of his new duties his mind, always subject to melancholy, became unbalanced, and, while on his way to Washington, he committed suicide near Nashville, Tennessee, October 11, 1809.

Jefferson wrote a memoir of Lewis, published in 1814 in connexion with Biddle and Alien’s Narrative of the Lewis and Clarke Expedition. A new edition by M i Vickar was published at New York in 1843.
