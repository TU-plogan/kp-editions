LEO XII. (Annibale della Genga), pope from 1823 to 1829, a native of Romagna, was born on August 22, 1760. In 1790 he first gained public recognition of his t dents by the success with which he accomplished the delicate task laid upon him by Pius VI. of pronouncing a funeral discourse over the emperor Joseph II.; in 1793 he was sent as nuncio to Lucerne with the title of archbishop of Tyre; in the following year he went, also as nuncio, to Cologne; in 1805 he attended the diet of Ratisbon as papal plenipotentiary; and in 1808 he shared with Caprara a difficult mission to France. Some years of retirement at the abbey of Monticelli now followed; but in 1814 he was made the bearer of the pope’s congratulations to Louis XVIII.; in 1816 he became cardinal priest of Sta. Maria Maggiore, receiving also the bishopric of Sinigaglia, while in 1820 he became cardinal vicarius. On September 28, 1823, he was chosen to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Pius VII.; at the time it was believed that he had not long to live, and, in point of fact, on the 23d day of the following December his condition became so serious that the last sacraments were administered to him; suddenly, however, he recovered. One of his first cares was for the due observance of the approaching jubilee year, and on May 27, 1824, the bull was sent forth which invited all Christendom to Rome in the following December; but foreign Governments responded coldly to the appeals made for their co-operation in forwarding pilgrims, and even Leo’s own subjects viewed the preparations made in their neighbourhood with indifference or aversion, and the most determined efforts of the papal government did not succeed in averting a somewhat ridiculous failure. Throughout his pontificate Leo showed himself a man of simple tastes and laborious habits; his diplomatic relations with the European powers were on the whole characterized by firmness, tact, and moderation, and perhaps the most unfavourable criticism to be made upon his domestic policy is that it was unpractical in its meddlesomeness and unstatesmanlike in its severity. He died on February 10, 1829, and was succeeded by Pius VIII.
