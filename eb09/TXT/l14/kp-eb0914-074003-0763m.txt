LLANELLY, a market-town, parliamentary borough, and seaport town of Carmarthenshire, South Wales, is situated on a creek of Carmarthen Bay, on the river Lougher, and on several railway lines, 11 miles west of Swansea, and 225 west-north-west of London. It is a prosperous manufacturing town. The church of St Elli or Llanelly is in the Early English style, with a square embattled tower. The other principal buildings are the town-hall and the athenaeum. The town possesses extensive docks. It imports large quantities of copper ore, and carries on an export trade in its special manufactures. For the last five years the exports have averaged above £150,000 annually, and the imports £50,000. There are copper, silver, lead, and tin works, iron foundries, manufactures of pottery, chemical works, brick and tile works, flour-mills, and breweries; and in the vicinity there are extensive collieries. Llanelly is included in the Carmarthen district of parliamentary boroughs. The population of the urban sanitary district in 1871 was 14,973, which in 1881 had increased to 19,655.
