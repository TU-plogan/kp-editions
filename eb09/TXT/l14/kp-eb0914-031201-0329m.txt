LARD is the melted and strained fat of the common hog. The bulk of the lard of commerce is obtained from the abdominal fat of the animal; but in the preparation of inferior qualities fatty scraps of all kinds which result from the preparation of pork are melted up, and occasionally entire flanks of pigs are treated for the fat they yield. Ordinary lard is a pure white fat of the consistency of butter, having a faint characteristic taste, and scarcely any odour. It melts at between 78° to 88° Fahr., has a specific gravity of 0*915, and consists of 62 per cent, of fluid fat (olein or lard oil), and 38 per cent, of the hard fats palmitin and stearin. If perfectly pure, it has no tendency to become rancid; but there is generally sufficient impurity present to develop a change in the olein, which gradually exhibits itself by a yellow colour and a rancid odour and taste. Lard is an article of considerable importance in commerce; it is calculated that the annual produce of the substance in the United States of America alone is not less than 5,000,000 cwts. Its preparation is conducted in connexion with the great pork-curing and packing establishments, mostly centred in Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis, Milwaukee, Louisville, and Indianapolis,—Chicago alone now monopolizing about one-half of the American trade. In these establishments the fat is “rendered” in large vats heated by coils or worms of steam pipes, each charge being completely melted in from ten to twelve hours. The greaves or cracklings which remain are used for making “dog biscuits,” &c. The finest lard is prepared from the “leaf” fat of the abdominal cavity, and passes into commerce as “prime steam lard.” The intestinal fat, trimmings, and refuse yield No. 2 lard, which is mostly sent to the European market. The summer-killed pigs yield on an average 34 lb of lard, while the winter-killed animals produce about 37 lb, but in the case of selected animals these figures may rise to 45 ft) and 54 ft) respectively. The uses of lard are numerous: it is largely employed by biscuit and pastry bakers and in domestic cookery; it is used in the dressing and currying of leather; it is an important article in pharmacy for ointments, plaisters, and suppositories; it forms a principal ingredient in many pomades and preparations for the toilet; and it is the source of the important lard oil and “solar stearin” noted below. Lard is occasionally adulterated with water up even to 20 per cent., with starch, chalk, plaster of Paris, baryta, &c. Such falsifications, owing to the nature of the substance, are easily detected :—the water by bringing the substance gently to the melting point when it separates; starch by the characteristic reaction with iodine; and mineral substance by the ash remaining after the burning of the fat. The imports into the United Kingdom in 1880 amounted to 927,512 cwts., value £1,852,160,—the very large proportion of 873,100 cwts. coming from the United States, and 46,618 from British North America. A large amount of native lard is also consumed in the United Kingdom, this being usually put up in bladders for sale. That prepared in Wiltshire is the most highly prized, and is the quality generally used in domestic cookery.

Lard oil is the limpid, clear, colourless oil expressed by pressure and gentle heat from lard, leaving a solid, glistening, and crystalline residue, known in commerce as “solar stearin,” which is useful in candle making, but is also used to adulterate spermaceti. Lard oil has now [9:14:313] an important function in industry, being principally employed for the oiling of wool and in lubrication. It is also a good deal consumed in the falsification of more valuable oils, for which its neutral properties well adapt it; and it in turn is adulterated with cotton seed oil, &c.
