LIVINGSTON, Edward (1764-1836), American jurist and statesman, was born in Clermont, Columbia county, New York, May 26, 1764. He was a great-grandson of Robert Livingston, the first possessor under royal patent of “Livingston Manor,” a tract of land on the Hudson, comprising the greater part of the present counties of Dutchess and Columbia. Having graduated at Princeton in 1781, he began to practise law in New York city, and rapidly rose to distinction as an advocate. He was a member of congress during 1794-98, and in 1801 was appointed United States district attorney for the State of New York, and while retaining that position was also elected mayor of New York city, then an office of high dignity and emolument. In the summer of 1803 New York was visited with a violent epidemic of yellow fever, during which Livingston displayed great courage and energy in his endeavours to prevent the spread of the disease, and to relieve the widespread distress. He suffered an attack of the fever in its most violent form, during which the people of the city gave many proofs of their attachment and anxiety. He recoveted to find his private affairs, which he had neglected, in some confusion, and he was at the same time deeply indebted to the Government for public funds which had been lost through the mismanagement of a confidential clerk. Livingston at once surrendered all his property, and, having resigned his offices, removed to Louis⅛ιna, which had then just been ceded by France to the United States. He soon acquired a large law practice in New Orleans, and repaid the Government in full. Almost immediately upon his arrival in Louisiana he was appointed by the legislature to prepare a provisional code of judicial procedure, which was continued in force from 1805 to 1825. During the short war with England in 1814-15, Livingston was active in' rousing the mixed population of New Orleans to resistance, and acted as adviser and aide-de-camp to Jackson. In 1821, by appointment of the legislature, Livingston began the preparation of a new code of criminal law and procedure, since widely known in Europe and America as the “Livingston Code.” It was prepared in both French and English, as required by the necessities of practice in Louisiana, and, though substantially completed in 1824, and in greater part then adopted by the State, it was not printed entire until 1833. It was at once reprinted in England, France, and Germany, attracting wide interest and praise from the most distinguished sources by its remarkable simplicity and vigour, and more especially by reason of its philanthropic provisions, which have noticeably influenced, the penal legislation of several countries. Livingston was a member of congress during 1823-29, was afterwards senator, and for two years secretary of state under President Jackson. From 1833 to 1835 he was minister plenipotentiary to France, and conducted with success negotiations of considerable difficulty and importance. He died May 23, 1836.
