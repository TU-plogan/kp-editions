LAUDER, Sir Thomas Dick, Bart. (1784-1848), was the only son of Sir Andrew Lauder, the sixth baronet, and was born at Edinburgh in 1784. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1820. In early life he published two romances, Lochandhu and the Wolf of Βadenoclι ; and such were the merits of his style that his first contribution to Blackwood's Magazine in 1817, entitled “Simon Roy, Gardener at Dunphail,” was by some ascribed to the author of Waverley. He was afterwards a frequent contributor to Blackwood and also to Tait's Magazine, and in 1830 he published the book by which his name is now best known, An Account of the Great Floods of August 1829 in the Province of Moray and adjoining Districts. Subsequent works were Highland Rambles, zvith Long Tales to shorten the Way (2 vols. 8vo, 1837), Legendary Tales of the Highlands (3 vols. 12mo, 1841), Tour Round the Coasts of Scotland, and Memorial of the Royal Progress in Scotland (1843). Lauder’s paper on “The Parallel Roads of Glenroy,” printed in vol. ix. of the Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, first drew attention to the phenomenon in question. Vol. i. of a Miscellany of Natural History, published in 1833, was also partly prepared by Lauder. He died on May 29, 1848. An unfinished series of papers, written for Tait's Magazine shortly before his death, was published under the title Scottish Rivers, with a preface by John Brown, M.D., iu 1874.
