LOIRET, a department of central France, made up of three districts of the ancient province of Orléanais,— Orléanais proper, Gâtinais, and Dunois,—together with portions of the Isle of France and Berri, lies between.
[9:14:809]

47° 30' and 48° 20' N. lat. and between 1° 30' and 3° 8' E. long., and is bounded on the N. by Seine·et-0ise, on the N.E. by Seine-et-Marne, on the E. by Yonne, on the S. by Nièvre and Cher, on the S.W. by Loir-et-Cher, and on the N.W. by Eure-et-Loir; its greatest length, from north-west to south-east, is 75 miles, its greatest breadth, from north to south along the meridian of Paris, 50 miles, and its area 2614 square miles. The name is derived from the Loiret, a stream which issues from the ground some miles to the south of Orleans, and after a course of about 7 miles falls into the Loire; its large volume gives rise to the belief that it is a subterranean branch of that river. The Loire traverses the department by a broad valley which, though frequently devastated by disastrous floods, is famed for its rich tilled lands, its castles, its towns, and its vineclad slopes. To the right of the Loire are Gâtinais (capital Montargis) and Beauce; the former district is so named from its gatines or wildernesses, of which saffron is, along with honey, the most noteworthy product; Beauce, on the other hand, a monotonous tract of corn-fields without either tree or river, has been called the granary of France. Between Beauce and the Loire is the extensive forest of Orleans, which is slowly disappearing before the advances of agriculture. South of the Loire is Sologne, long barren and unhealthy from the impermeability of its subsoil, but undergoing gradual improvement in both respects by means of pine plantation and draining and manuring operations. The surface of the department presents little variation of level; the highest point (on the borders of Cher) is 900 feet above the level of the sea, and the lowest (ou the borders of Seine-et-Marne) is 220 feet. The watershed on the plateau of Orleans between the basins of the Seine and Loire, which divide Loiret almost equally between them, is almost imperceptible. The lateral canal of the Loire from Roanne stops at Briare; from the latter town a canal connects with the Seine by the Loing valley, which is joined by the Orleans canal at Montargis. The only important tributary of the Loire within the department is the Loiret; the Loing, a tributary of the Seine, has a course of 40 miles from south to north, and is accompanied throughout first by the Briare canal and afterwards by that of Loing. The Essonne, another important affluent of the Seine, entering Loiret at Malesherbes, takes its rise on the plateau of Orleans, as also does its tributary the Juine. The department has the climate of the Sequanian region, the mean temperature being almost the same as that of Paris; the number of rainy days is one hundred and twenty, and the rainfall varies from 18 - 5 to 27 ’ 5 inches according to the district, that of the exposed Beauce being smaller than that of the woody Sologne. Two-thirds of the entire area is cultivable; between one-sixth and one-seventh is under wood; vineyards occupy one-twentieth; and the remainder is taken up by meadows, heath, and marsh.

A large number of sheep, cattle, horses, asses, pigs, and goats are reared; poultry, especially geese, and bees are plentiful. The yield of wheat and oats is much in excess of the consumption; the crops of rye, barley, meslin, potatoes, beetroot, colza, and hemp are also very important. Wine is abundant, but of inferior quality. Buckwheat supports bees by its flowers, and poultry by its seeds. Saffron is another source of wealth. The woods consist of oak, elm, birch, and pine; fruit trees thrive in the department, and Orleans is a great centre of nursery gardens. The industries are brick and tile making, and the manufacture of faience, for which Gien is one of the most important centres in France. The Briare manufacture of porcelain buttons and pearls employs 1500 workmen. Flourmills are very numerous. There are iron and brass foundries, which, along with agricultural implement making, bell-founding, and the manufacture of pins, nails, and files, represent the chief metalworking industries. The production of hosiery, wool-spinning, and various forms of wool manufacture are also engaged in. A large quantity of the wine grown is made into vinegar (vinaigre d’Orléans). The tanneries produce excellent leather; and paper-making, sugar-refining, wax-bleaching, and the manufacture of caoutchouc (in one factory) complete the list of industries. The exports are principally corn, flour, wine, vinegar, live-stock, and wood. The four arrondissements are those of Orleans, Gien, Montargis, and Pithiviers. The capital is Orleans. The population in 1876 was 360,903 an increase of 70,764 since 1801.
