LEO VI., Flavius, surnamed Sapiens and Philosophus, succeeded his father, Basil I., in 886, and died in 911. One of his first acts was to depose the well-known Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, who had been his tutor. The rest of his biography, so far as recorded, tells of unimportant wars with barbarians and struggles with churchmen. In explanation of his somewhat absurd surname, all that can be said, as Gibbon has remarked, is “that the son of Basil was less ignorant than the greater part of his contemporaries in church and state, that his education had been directed by the learned Photius, and that several books of profane and ecclesiastical science were composed by the pen, or in the name, of the imperial philosopher. - ’ His works include a treatise on military tactics (De Apparatu Bellico, translated by Sir John Cheks in 1554, and frequently since), seventeen Oracula, in iambic verse, on the destinies of future emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople, thirty-three Orations, chiefly on theological subjects, and some epigrams in the Greek Anthology.
