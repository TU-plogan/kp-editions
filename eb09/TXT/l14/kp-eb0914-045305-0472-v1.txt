LEOCHARES, one of the sculptors of the younger Attic school in the fine period of Greek art. He is called a young man in a pseudo-Platonic epistle which must be later than 366 b.c. He worked on the Mausoleum along with Scopas, Bryaxis, Timotheos, and Pythis about 356 B.C.; the west side of the frieze, of which all the extant fragments are in the British Museum, was entrusted to him. He made the statue of Isocrates which was erected at Athens about 354 b.c. Many other portrait statues are known to have been his work. Along with Lysippus he represented Alexander the Great engaged in a lion hunt. This group was in bronze, whereas another in the Philippeion at Olympia, representing the family of Philip and Alexander, was in ivory and gold. Finally, an inscription records that he made the statues of an Athenian family. Though nothing is recorded of the character of these works, it may be gathered from the list that they were idealized [9:14:454] portraits; chryselephantine statues were always ideal. Leochares was also the sculptor of many purely ideal works. These comprise three statues of Zeus, of which one was on the Acropolis, one at the Piraeeus, and the third was carried away to Rome, where Pliny saw it on the Capitol; he is also recorded to have carved three statues of Apollo, one of which was bought by Dionysius of Syracuse. Absolutely nothing is known of the character of these works; but we are more fortunate in regard to his masterpiece, the Rape of Ganymede, of which many imitations have been preserved to us sufficient to give some idea of its real character. Ganymede, characterized as a shepherd by crook and syrinx, has been resting under a tree, when the eagle swoops down and bears him off direct heavenwards; the looks of both are directed upwards, Ganymede, a youth of perfect beauty, does not struggle, but yields himself completely to his captor, so that his body hangs down in easy, graceful lines. The eagle, with magnificent outstretched wings, conscious, as Pliny says, “what his burden is and to whom he bears it,” grasps the boy gently with his talons, and seems to swoop straight upwards, unencumbered by the weight. The problem of supporting the figures in the air, clumsily solved in the imitation preserved at St Mark’s in Venice by hanging the group up with a rope, was skilfully overcome by means of the tree from beneath which the boy has been seized; while the dog beneath, looking up after his master, both gives an appearance of naturalness to the whole scene, and suggests more vividly the idea that the boy is far above the ground. The great skill of the group lay in the manner in which the idea of swift easy motion upwards was expressed; while the widespread wings of the eagle and the drooping form of the boy gave a beautiful outline to the whole. Overbeck (Gesch. der Griech. Plast., ii. 51) has well expressed the distinction between the fine character of this work and the sensualism of a later class of similar groups, where the eagle is obviously Zeus himself and not a mere messenger. The colossal acrolithic statue of Ares at Halicarnassus is sometimes attributed to Leochares, sometimes to Timotheus.

On the share of Leochares in the Mausoleum and on the style of the sculptures, see Newton, Halicarnassus, Cnidus, and Branchïdae. On the inscriptions mentioning works of Leochares, see Overbeck, Schriftquellen. See also Jahn, Archaeol. Beitr., p. 20.
