LOIRE, a department of central France, made up of the old district of Forez and portions of Beaujolais and Lyonnais, all formerly included in the province of Lyonnais, lies between 45° 15' and 46° 15' N. lat. and between 3° 40' and 4° 45' E. long., and is bounded on theN. by the department of Saône-et-Loire, on the E. by those of Rhone and Isère, on the S. by Ardèche and Haute-Loire, and on the W. by Puy de Dôme and Allier. Its extreme length is 78 miles from north-west to south-east, and its extreme breadth from east to west is about 43 miles, the area being 1838 square miles. Until 1790 it constituted a single department along with that of Rhone. About an eighth part of the whole area belongs to the basin of the Rhone. The Loire, which has a fall within the department from 1365 feet to 886 feet, traverses alternately a series of narrow gorges and of broad plains, the beds of ancient lakes, including that of Forez between St Rambert and Feurs, and, lower down, that of Roanne. Of its affluents the most important are the Lignon du Nord, the beautiful valley of which has been called “La Suisse Forezienne,” and the Aix on the left, and on the right the Ondaine (on which stand the industrial towns of Chambon-Feugerolles and Firminy), the Furens, and the Rhin. To the Rhone the department contributes the Gier, upon which are situated the industrial towns of St Chamond and Rive de Gier, and which forms a navigable channel to the Rhone at Givors. From Mont Pilat descends the Deôme, in the valley of which the workshops of Annonay begin. In the west are the Forez mountains, which separate the Loire basin from that of the Allier; their highest point (Pierre sur Haute, 5381 feet) is 12 miles west from Montbrison. They sink gradually towards the north, and are successively called Bois Noirs (4239 feet), from their woods, and Monts de la Madeleine (3600 to 1640 feet). In the east the Rhone and Loire basins are separated by Mont Pilat (4705 feet) at the north extremity of the Cevennes, and by the hills of Lyonnais, Tarare, Beaujolais, and Charolais, none of which rise higher than 2950 or 3280 feet. The climate of the department varies according to the elevation: on the heights it is cold and healthy, unwholesome in the marshy plain of Forez, mild in the valley of the Rhone. The annual rainfall is 39 , 37 inches on the Forez mountains, but only 24 , 79 at Roanne. More than half of the area consists of arable lands; one-seventh is occupied by forests, and one-seventh by meadows.

The plains of Forez and Roanne are the two most important agricultural districts, but the total production of grain within the department is insufficient for the requirements of the population. The pasture lands of Forez support a large number of horned cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. Fairly good red wine is also grown within the department; potatoes, leguminous plants, beetroot, hemp, and colza are also cultivated. Poultry are reared, and bee-keeping is a considerable industry. Among the hills replantation has been set on foot. The Bois Noir forests yield good-sized pines and large quantities of wood for mining purposes. The so-called Lyons chestnuts are to a large extent obtained from Forez; the woods and pasture lands of Pilat yield medicinal plants, such as mint. The chief wealth of the department, however, lies in the coal deposits in the St Etienne basin, the second in importance in France. The basin, which stretches from south-west to north-east between Firminy and Rive de Gier, is about 20 miles in length and 5 in breadth. In 1881 the output amounted to 3,454,612 tons of coal and anthracite, giving employment to 12,000 workmen below and 5000 above. The presence of coal has naturally encouraged various forms of the metal-working industries. At St Étienne there is a national factory of arms, in which as many as 6000 have been employed; apart from other factories of the same kind carried on by private individuals, the production of hardware occupies 7000 persons; locks, common cutlery, chain cables for the mines, files, and nails are also made. Cast steel is largely manufactured, the aggregate production of all sorts of steel amounting in 1880 tβ 114,629 tons; the Loire workshops supply the heaviest constructions required in naval architecture. The glass industry has its centre at Rive de Gier. St Étienne employs more than 60,000 persons in the fabrication of silk ribbons, to an annual value of £4,000,000; over and above this must be reckoned the manufacture of elastic ribbons and laces, and the dressing of raw silks. The arrondissement of Roanne manufactures cotton stuffs upon 11,000 looms, each employing three persons. That of Montbrison produces table linen. In the mountains between Haute-Loire and Puy de Dôme the women make black laces and embroidery. The department has numerous flour-mills, paper works, tanyards, boatbuilding yards, silk-spinning works, and velvet, plush, and hat factories. There are three arrondissements—St Étienne, Montbrison, and Roanne. The capital is St Étienne. The population, 290,903 in 1801, was 590,613 in 1876.
