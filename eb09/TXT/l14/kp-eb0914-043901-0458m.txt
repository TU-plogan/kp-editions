LEMONNIER, Pierre Charles (1715-1799), a distinguished astronomer, was born in Paris, November 23, 1715, where his father combined the practice of astronomy with the profession of philosophy. His first recorded observation was made before he was sixteen, and the presentation of an elaborate lunar map procured for him admission to the Academy, April 21, 1736, at the early age of twenty. He was chosen in the same year to accompany Maupertuis and Clairaut on their geodesical expedition to Lapland. In 1738, shortly after his return, he explained, in a memoir read before the Academy, the striking advantages of Flamsteed’s mode of determining right ascensions. Indeed his persistent recommendation of English methods and instruments combined with the labours of Lacaille to effect a revolution in French practical astronomy, and constituted the most eminent of his services to science. He corresponded with Bradley, was the first to represent the effects of nutation in the solar tables, and introduced, in 1741, the use of the transit-instrument at the Paris observatory. He visited England in 1748, and in company with the earl of Morton and Short the optician continued his journey to Scotland, where he observed the annular eclipse of July 25. The liberality of Louis XV., in whose favour he stood high, furnished him with the means of procuring the best instruments, many of them by English makers, and gave him the command of the royal printing establishment for the publication of his works. Amongst the fruits of his industry may be mentioned a laborious investigation of the disturbances of Jupiter by Saturn, the results of which were employed and confirmed by Euler in his prize essay of 1748; a series of lunar observations extending over fifty years; some interesting researches in terrestrial magnetism and atmospheric electricity, in the latter of which he detected a regular diurnal period; and the determination of the places of a great number of stars, including twelve separate observations of Uranus, between 1765 and its discovery as a planet. In his lectures at the Collège de France he first publicly expounded the analytical theory of gravitation, and his timely patronage secured the services of Lalande for astronomy. His temper was irritable, and his hasty utterances exposed him to retorts which he did not readily forgive. Against Lalande, his jealousy having been excited by his preference for Lacaille, he closed his doors “during an entire revolution of the moon’s nodes.” His career was arrested by paralysis late in 1791, and a repetition of the stroke terminated his life. He died at Héril near Bayeux, May 31, 1799. By his marriage with Mademoiselle de Cussy, he left three daughters, one of whom became the wife of Lagrange. He was admitted in 1739 to the Royal Society, and was one of the one hundred and forty-four original members of the Institute.

He wrote Histoire Celeste, 1741; Théorie des Comètes, 1743, a translation, with additions, of Halley’s Synopsis; Institutions astronomiques, 1746, an improved translation of Keill’s text-book; Nouveau Zodiaque, 1755; Observations de la Lune, du Soleil, et des Étoiles fixes, 1751-75; Lois du magnétisme, 1776-78, &c.
