LARDNER, Nathaniel (1684-1768), author of the The Credibility of the Gospel History, was born at Hawkhurst, Kent, in 1684. After having studied for the Presbyterian ministry in London, and also at Utrecht and Leyden, he in 1709 took licence as a preacher; but, failing to gain acceptance in the pulpit, he in 1713 entered the family of a lady of rank as tutor and domestic chaplain, and in this position he remained until 1721. In 1724 he was appointed to deliver the Tuesday evening lecture in the Presbyterian chapel, Old Jewry, London, and in 1729 he became assistant minister to the Presbyterian congregation in Crutched Friars. He died at Hawkhurst on July 24, 1768.

An anonymous volume of Memoirs appeared in 1769; and a life by Kippis is prefixed to the edition of the Works of Lardner, published in 11 vols. 8vo in 1788, in 4 vols. 4to in 1817, and 10 vols. 8vo in 1827. The full title of his principal work—a work which, though now quite out of date, gives its author a permanent place of some respectability in the history of Christian apologetics—is The Credibility of the Gospel History; or the Principal Facts of the New Testament confirmed by Passages of Ancient Authors, who were contemporary with our Saviour or his Apostles, or lived near their time. Part i., in 2 vols. 8vo, appeared in 1727; the publication of part ii., in 12 vols. 8vo, began in 1733 and ended in 1755. In 1730 there was a second edition of part i., and the Additions and Alterations were also published separately. A Supplement, otherwise entitled A History of the Apostles and Evangelists, Writers of the New Testament, was added in 3 vols. (1756-57), and reprinted in 1760. Other works by Lardner are A large Collection of Ancient Jewish and Heathen Testimonies to the Truth of the Christian Revelation, with Notes and Observations, 4 vols. 4to, 1764-67; The History of the Heretics of the two first Centuries after Christ, published posthumously in 1780; a considerable number of occasional sermons; and A Letter concerning the question whether the Logos supplied the place of the Human Soul in the Person of Jesus Christ. In this tract, written in 1730 and published in 1759, Lardner indicated his preference for the Unitarian view.
