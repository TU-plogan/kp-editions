LEAMINGTON, anciently Leamington Priors, or, by licence, since 1838, Royal Leamington Spa, is a municipal borough and watering-place of Warwickshire, England, situated 2 miles east from Warwick, on the Learn, near its junction with Shakespeareâ€™s Avon. Its rise dates from about 1786, when baths were first erected in connexion with saline springs which are held to possess various curative properties, and which had been noticed by Camden in 1586. But the rapid increase and continued prosperity of the town are due also, among other causes, to its beautiful and finely sheltered site, to its aristocratic neighbourhood, and to the fine hunting country by which it is surrounded. To this must be added its advantages of railway communication by the Great Western and NorthWestern lines, and the proximity of places of historical and sentimental interest. Warwick is but 2 miles off, Kenilworth 5, Coventry 9, and Stratford-on-Avon 10; while Evesham, Naseby and Bosworth, and Oxford are all within easy reach. Though the houses are handsome, and the streets spacious and well kept, the rates are low, and living is not expensive. There is a choice of social clubs, with churches and chapels in large number, hospitals, an important college, and many fashionable schools. The town has five newspapers, a free library, and a school board. The water, supplied from artesian wells, is pure and abundant. The death rate is but 15 per 1000, which, considering the large numbers of elderly people who settle there, is very low. The fact that nearly all the property is freehold offers great facilities to those desirous of living in their own houses, and is among the inducements to people to make this a place of permanent residence. The Jephson and pump-room gardens are delightful promenades. Leamington was incorporated in 1875. From a population of 543 in 1811 it has, with its suburbs, increased to 26,074 in 1881.
