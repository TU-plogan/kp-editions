LANCASTER, a municipal borough and seaport town, the capital of Lancashire, England, is situated on the left bank of the river Lune, about 7 miles from its mouth, and on the London and North-Western Railway, 52 miles north-west of Manchester. It is built on the slope of an eminence crowned by the old castle and church, and commanding fine views of the river and surrounding country. The older portion of the town is irregularly built, but of late years it has been much improved by the formation of new streets; and the sanitary and other arrangements are complete and satisfactory. The Lune is crossed by a bridge of five arches erected in 1788, and to the north of the town the Lancaster Canal is conveyed over the river by a handsome aqueduct. The ancient castle occupies the site of a Roman castrum. The Saxon foundations of a yet older structure still remain, and the tower at the south-west corner is supposed to have been erected during the reign of the emperor Hadrian. The Dungeon Tower, also supposed to be of Roman origin, was taken down in 1818. The greater part of the old portion of the present structure was built by Roger de Poictou, who, however, utilized some of the old Roman towers and the old walls in its erection. In 1322 much damage was done to the castle by Robert Bruce, whose attack it successfully resisted, but it was restored and strengthened by John of Gaunt, who added the greater part of the Gateway Tower as well as turrets to the Lungess Tower, which on that account has been named “John o’ Gaunt’s Chair.” During the wars of the Commonwealth the castle was captured by Cromwell. Shortly afterwards it was converted into the county jail, [9:14:255] and the building now includes the governor’s house and the crown and nisi prius courts. To the north-east of the castle is the church of St Mary, in the Early English style, originally erected by Roger de Poictou, but partly rebuilt in 1759, when the present lofty tower was added. The church contains several old monuments and brasses. A large Gothic Roman Catholic church, with a convent and schools adjoining, was erected in 1859, and there are also several other churches and chapels of some architectural pretensions. There is a grammar school, completed in 1853. Among the charitable institutions are the county lunatic asylum, the Ripley orphan hospital, opened in 1864, erected and endowed at a cost of £100,000, the dispensary and infirmary instituted in 1781, and the Royal Albert asylum for idiots and imbeciles. The town possesses a large market and a handsome town-hall. The principal industries of the town are cotton and silk spinning, cabinetmaking, and the manufacture of oil-cloth tablecovers; and there are also iron-foundries, marble-polishing works, and a manufactory for railway carriages and waggons. The bulk of the shipping is engaged in the coasting trade, and large vessels require to unload at Glasson, 5 miles down the river, the cargoes being carried up to the town by lighters. The population of the municipal borough in 1871 was 17,245, and in 1881 it was 20,724.

From discoveries of celts, flint arrow-heads, and other similar remains, it is probable that Lancaster was an old British town. Its Roman name is unknown, but inscribed Roman altars, tombstones, Samian ware, and other pottery, and the remains of the old fortress preceding the castle, and of other buildings, leave no doubt that it was a Roman station of great importance. It was constituted a borough in the fourth year of Richard I., and it first returned members to parliament in the twenty-third year of Edward I. The privilege was withdrawn for some years before 1547, but from that time was enjoyed without interruption until 1867, when it was disfranchised for corrupt practices. The town was plundered and burned by the Scots in 1329 and 1389, was nearly depopulated during the Wars of the Roses, was captured by the Parliamentary forces in 1643, and retaken by the Royalists under the earl of Derby in the same year, was held by the Parliamentary troops in 1648, and was partly destroyed by fire in 1698. It was entered by the rebels in 1715, and again by a larger force of them in 1745.
