LILLEBONNE, capital of a canton in the department of Seine-Inférieure, France, 131 miles west-north-west by rail from Paris, and 20 miles due east from Havre, is a pretty little town, picturesquely built at the foot of wooded hills, in the valley of the Bolbec, which falls into the Seine 3 miles lower, at Port Jérôme. The principal industries are cotton-spinning and the manufacture of calico. The population in 1876 was 5400.

Lillebonne was the capital of the Caletes, or inhabitants of the Pays de Caux, in the time of Caesar, by whom it was destroyed. It was afterwards rebuilt by Augustus, who called it Juliobona afteι∙ his daughter; and before it was again ruined by the barbarian invasions it had become a very important centre, whence Roman roads branched out in all directions. Some forty years ago the remains of ancient baths and of a theatre capable of containing 3000 persons were brought to light. Statues, tombstones, all sorts of articles in iron, bronze, ivory, marble, stone, glass, &c., have been found in the course of excavation, and deposited, for the most part, in the museum at Rouen. The most beautiful object yet discovered is a large mosaic found in 1870 (some 28 feet by 21). In the Middle Ages the fortifications of the town were constructed out of the materials supplied by the theatre. William of Normandy built at Lillebonne a castle whence he dates several charters. It is now a ruin within a charming park. The 13th century donjon, with walls over 12 feet in thickness, is in admirable preservation. The church of Notre Dame, of the 16th century, had a fine porch, formerly adorned with rich sculptures, which have mostly disappeared. The graceful tower is about 180 feet high.
