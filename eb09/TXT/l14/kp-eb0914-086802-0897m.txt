LONS-LE-SAULNIER, capital of the department of Jura, France, is situated at a distance of 275 miles by rail from Paris, on the Vallière, a small tributary of the Saône, about 820 feet above the sea-level, at the point where the Besançon, Lyons, and Châlon-sur-Saône railways converge. It is pleasantly surrounded by vine-clad hills from 300 to 500 feet in height, consisting of lower spurs of the Jura chain. It owes its name to its salt-pits, which have been used from a very remote period; the large quantities of ashes derived from the wood burnt in the process of evaporation are extensively utilized in agriculture. Since 1839 there has been an establishment for the use of the mineral waters. The principal industry of the place is the manufacture of sparkling wines, the Etoile growth being the best for this purpose. There is also a foundry, in addition to printing establishments, tanneries, distilleries, brush factories, and manufactures of coverlets and carpets. About a mile to the west of the town are the salt-mines of Montmorot, employing one hundred and fifty workmen; the bed of rock salt, which lies at a depth of 400 feet, and is nearly 100 feet thick, yields about 9500 tons of pure salt yearly, 885 tons of sulphate of soda, and 300 tons of chloride of potassium. Lons-le-Saulnier possesses no buildings of special interest; one of the public squares contains a statue of Lecourbe, and there is a museum containing Gallo-Roman antiquities and various works of art. The library, which like the museum is in the town-hall, has 20,000 volumes. The population in 1876 was 11,371.

Lons-le-Saulnier, originally a Gallic town, was fortified by the Romans, destroyed by the barbarians, and, afterwards rebuilt and extended, belonged for a long time during the mediaeval period to the powerful house of Châlon, a younger branch of that of Burgundy. It was burned in 1364 by the English, and again in 1637, when it was seized by the duke of Longueville for Louis XIII. It became definitively French in 1674. It was there that the meeting between Ney and Napoleon took place, on the return of the latter from Elba, on March 31, 1815. Rouget de l ’ Isle, the author of the Marseillaise Hymn, was born at Montaigu near this town.
