LA BADIE, LABADISTS. Jean de la Badie, a noted Pietist leader in the 17th century, was the son of Jean Charles de la Badie, governor of Guyenne; he was born in the town of Bourg not far from Bordeaux, on the 13th of February 1610, and died in Altona, on the 13th of February 1674. He was sent along with two brothers to the Jesuit school at Bordeaux, where his talents attracted the attention of bis teachers, and they secured him for their order against the wishes of his parents. In 1626 he began to study philosophy and theology, and in due time made his profession. From a study of the Bible, of Augustine, Bernard, and the mystics, he was led to hold somewhat extreme views about the efficacy of prayer and the direct influence of the Holy Spirit upon believers, and adopted Augustinian views about grace, free will, and predestination, which brought him into collision with his order. The result was that he resigned and was separated from the Jesuits on the plea of ill health. He then became a preacher to the people, and was encouraged by his bishop to devote himself to this work. The study of Calvin’s Institutes, however, taught him that he had more in common with the Reformed than with the Roman Catholic Church, and after various adventures he joined the Reformed Church of France at Montauban in 1650. His fame had preceded him, and his accession to the ranks of the Protestants was deemed a great triumph; no such man since Calvin himself, it was said, had left the Roman Catholic Church. He was called to the pastorate of the church at Orange on the Rhone, and at once became noted for the severity of the discipline he exercised. He set his face zealously against dancing, card-playing, and worldly entertainments. The unsettled state of the country, recently annexed to France, compelled him to leave Orange. He accepted a call to the French church in London, but did not stay there long; and after various wanderings he at length settled at Middelburg, where he was called to be pastor to the French-speaking congregation. His peculiar opinions were by this time (1666) well known, and his congregation and himself at once found themselves in conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities. Various “classes” and synods met and discussed the “seditious sermons and new and erroneous doctrine which De la Badie had preached in various of our churches before he had been inducted at Middelburg,” and the result was the establishment of a separate church by De la Badie and his followers. He had gathered round him some enthusiastic disciples, Peter Yvon at Montauban, Peter Dulignon, Francis Menuret, and more important than any Anna Maria v. Schiirman, whose book Eucleιia is perhaps the best exposition of the tenets of her master. At Middelburg, at the head of his separatist congregation, De la Badie developed his views for a reformation of the Reformed Churches :—the church is a communion of holy people who have been born again from sin; baptism is the sign and seal of this regeneration, and is to be administered only to believers; the Holy Spirit guides the regenerate into all truth, and the church possesses throughout all time those gifts of prophecy which it had in the ancient days; the community at Jerusalem is the continual type of every Christian congregation, therefore there should be a community of goods, the disciples should live together, eat together, dance together; marriage is a holy ordinance between two believers, and the children of the regenerate are born without original sin; marriage with an unregenerate person is not binding. The life and separatism of the community brought them into frequent collision with their neighbours and with the magistrates of Middelburg, and in 1670 they accepted the invitation of the princess Elizabeth, abbess of Herford in Westphalia, to take up their abode within her territories, and settled down in Herford to the number of about fifty. Not finding the rest they expected, however, they migrated to Altona in 1672, where they were dispersed on the death of the leaders. Small communities also existed in the Rhineland, and a missionary settlement was established in New York.
