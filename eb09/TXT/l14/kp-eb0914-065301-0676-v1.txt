LINARES, an important mining town in the province of Jaen, Spain, is situated in an arid plain, near the foot of the Sierra Morena, 24 miles north-north-east from the town of Jaen, 12 north-east from that of Baeza, and half an hour by rail from the Vadollano station of the Madrid and Cordova line. The streets are ill paved, irregular, and ugly, and, apart from a fine fountain of Roman origin, the town presents no architectural features of interest. There is some trade in the oil and wine of the neighbourhood, which are excellent and plentiful; wool is exported to Catalonia and Valencia; and cattle-breeding, especially of animals for the bull-ring, is also carried on. But the population, which in 1877 numbered 36,630, and includes some 120 English, with a consul and a chaplain, is chiefly engaged in the working of the extensive lead-mines to the north-west of the town, and in various concomitant industries, such as the manufacture of gunpowder, dynamite, match for blasting purposes, rope, and the like. The mining plant is entirely imported, principally from England. In respect of the quantity and uniform excellence of their productions the lead-mines of the province of Jaen are unsurpassed. For the year 1876-77 the joint output of those of Linares, Vilches, Baden, Carboneros, Santa Helena, and (in part) La Carolina was stated at 1,620,000 cwts. of ore, worth upwards of £800,000,—the proportion of silver to lead varying from 20 to 60 grammes of the former to every 50 kilogrammes of the latter. The best class of ore is exported, chiefly to France and Belgium; the inferior classes are smelted for the most part in Spain. About 2 miles to the south of Linares is the village of Cazlona, which still shows some remains of the ancient Castulo; and the ancient mines some 5 miles to the north, which are now known as “Los Pozos de Anibal,” may with some probability be assigned to the Carthaginian period.
