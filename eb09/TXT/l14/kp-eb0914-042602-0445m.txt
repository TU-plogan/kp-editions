LEIGH, Edward (1602-1671), Puritan linguist and theologian, was born in 1602 at Shawell, Leicestershire, was educated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, from 1616, and subsequently became a member of the Middle Temple. In 1636 he entered parliament as member for Stafford, and during the civil war he held a colonelcy in the parliamentary army. He has sometimes been confounded with John Ley, and so represented as having sat in the Westminster Assembly. The public career of Leigh terminated with his expulsion from parliament »long with the rest of the Presbyterian party in 1648. From an early period in his life he devoted much of his time to the study of theology and to the preparation for the press of numerous compilations, the most important of these being the Critica Sacra, containing observations on all the Padices of the Hebrew Words of the Old and the Greek of the New Testament (1639-44; new ed., with supplement, 1662), for which the author received the thanks of the Westminster Assembly, to whom it was dedicated. It has frequently been reprinted abroad, and, in the opinion of Leigh’s contemporary Fuller, it, “with many other worthy works, will make his judicious industry known to posterity.” It is now, however, but little used. Leigh died in Staffordshire in June 1671.

His remaining works include A Treatise of Divinity (1646-51), A Body of Divinity (1654), Annotations upon the New Testament [9:14:427] (1650), of which a Latin translation by Arnold was published at Leipsic in 1732, Annotations on the Five Poetical Books of the Old Testament (1657), A Treatise of Religion and Beaming (1656), Select and Choice Observations concerning the First Twelve Caesars (1635).
