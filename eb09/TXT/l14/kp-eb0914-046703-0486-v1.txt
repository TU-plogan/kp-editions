LEOPOLD I. (1676-1747), duke of Anhalt-Dessau, der alte Dessauer, a famous Prussian general, was born at Dessau, July 3, 1676. Possessing great physical energy and an absorbing interest in military affairs, he at an early age displayed capacity for commands of high responsibility. On the death of his father in 1693 he succeeded him as colonel of a regiment in the service of Brandenburg, and, having rendered invaluable assistance at the capture of Namur by William III of Orange in 1696, he obtained the rank of major-general. Returning shortly afterwards to his principality, he conceived a passionate attachment for the daughter of an apothecary, whom he raised to the rank of nobility and made his wife on reaching his majority. During the years that he now spent in his principality, he won the ardent affection of the mass of the people, both by his considerate regard for their welfare and by the influence of his strong personality. In command of a division of twelve thousand men at Blenheim in 1704, Leopold so acted in a critical contingency as practically to turn the scales of victory; and in Eugene’s Italian campaigns he was conspicuous at the battle of Cassano in 1705, the storming of Turin in 1706, and in other affairs of minor importance. After serving as a volunteer at Malplaquet in 1709, he received an independent command from Prussia, and rendered important assistance to Marlborough against Villars. Created fieldmarshal in 1715, he gained the special confidence of Frederick William I., and it was in no small degree to his instructions in military tactics, and the splendid perfection to which he had brought the small army of Prussia, that the great military triumphs of Frederick II. were due. His more important military inventions are the iron ramrod and the equal step. As a general he specially excelled in stratagems and surprises, in which he was greatly aided by his daring and impetuous energy. These qualities were specially displayed in the surprise and bloodless capture of Mörs castle in 1712, the seizure during night of the island of Rügen in 1715, the formation in 1741 of the famous entrenched camp at Göttin near Magdeburg, where with an army of thirty-six thousand men he was prepared for events either in Saxony or Hanover, the defeat of the Austrians at Neustadt in 1744, and the expulsion of the Saxons, though superior both in numbers and artillery, from a strongly entrenched position at Kesselsdorf in 1745. He died 7th April 1747. Leopold is graphically portrayed in Carlyle’s Frederick, where he is spoken of as “a man of vast dumb faculty, dumb but fertile, deep—no end of imagination, no end of ingenuities—with as much mother wit as in whole talking parliaments.”
