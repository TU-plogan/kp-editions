LIMBURG, or Limboπrg, one of the nine provinces of Belgium, is bounded on the N. and E. by Holland, on the S. by the province of Liège, and on the W. by those of Brabant and Antwerp; the area is 932 square miles, with a population, in 1880, of 211,694. The surface is for the most part flat, but rising somewhat towards the south-east. Most of the province is included in the barren and marshy district of sandy heath known as La Campine (Flem., Kempen). The Meuse, with a tolerably fertile valley, is its chief river. The soil is metalliferous; the chief vegetable products are cereals, leguminous plants, flax, hemp, and beetroot; and stock-breeding is largely carried on. Industries are less developed in Limburg than in the rest of Belgium; but the distilleries of the province are very considerable and noted. Limburg is divided for administrative purposes into three arrondissements, of which the capitals are Hasselt (population 11,500), Tongres (7600), and Maeseyck (4400). The last-named is the birthplace of Hubert and John van Eyck, the Flemish painters. One of the most interesting towns of the province is St Trond (5 ’.v.), thought to be the ancient Atuaticunι Oppidum, the oldest town in Belgium. Near Tongres is a mineral well, described by Pliny.

The territory of Limburg was that of the Eburones, whom the Romans exterminated, and was afterwards inhabited by the Tungri and Tαxαndri. It was one of the first conquests of the invading Franks, who established themselves and proclaimed their first kings there. In the Middle Ages it constituted the county of Looz, holding of the bishop of Liège; afterwards it became the duchy of Limburg, which was taken possession of in the 13th century by the duke of Brabant. From the 12th to the end of the 18th century the duchy included only a small portion of the present province; it extended eastward from the Meuse as far as to Aix-la-Chapelle, and southward to the Vesdre. In the 16th century Limburg remained in the possession of Spain, and it passed to Austria in 1713. After the treaty of Campo Formio (1797) it became a French department, Meuse-Inférieure, with Maestricht as capital. By the treaty of [9:14:646] Vienna (1815) it formed one of the nineteen provinces of the kingdom of the Netherlands, and by that of London (1831) the eastern portion was ceded to Holland, becoming a Dutch province, the remainder constituting the present province of Belgium.
