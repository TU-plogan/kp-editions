LICHTENBERG, Georg Christoph (1744-1799), physicist and satirical writer, was born at Oberramstadt, near Darmstadt, July 1, 1744. In 1763 he entered Göttingen university, where in 1770, after spending several years in England, he became extraordinary professor of physics, and five years later ordinary professor. This post he continued to hold till his death, February 24, 1799. As a physicist he is best known for his investigations in electricity, more especially as to the so-called Lichtenberg figures (see vol. viii. p. 66), which are fully described in two memoirs De nova methodo naturam ac motum fluidi electrici investigandi (Göttingen, 1778-79). He sent many excellent contributions to the Göttingen Τasch j enkalender from 1778 onwards, and to the G'ottingische Magazin der Literatur und Wissenschaft, which he edited for three years (1780-82) along with J. G. A. Forster.

His various scientific writings occupy the latter part of his Vermischte Schriften, edited by Kriess (9 vols., Göttingen, 1800-5; new edition, 6 vols., Gotha, 1844-46). The earlier volumes of these collected writings contain his satirical and humorous productions. His keen satire involved him in many a literary controversy with well-known contemporaries, such as Lavater, whose science of physiognomy he wittily ridiculed, and Voss, whose views on Greek pronunciation called forth a powerful satire Ueber die Pronunciation der Schlipse des alten Griechenlandes (1782). Notes of his lectures on natural philosophy, astronomy, and physical geography were published by Gamauf (Vienna, 1808-12, 1813, 1819); and more recently some of his brilliant sayings have been collected by Grisebach in one volume, Lichtenberg' 's Gedanken und Maximen : Licld- Strahlen aus seinen Werken (Leipsic, 1871).
