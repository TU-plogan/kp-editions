LIMBURG, a town in the circle of Unterlahn and district of Wiesbaden, Prussia, is situated 360 feet above the sea-level, on the Lahn, here crossed by a bridge dating from 1315, and on the Nassau Railway midway between Coblentz and Wetzlar. A local branch line connects it with Hadamar, It is the seat of a Catholic bishep, and has one evangelical and four Catholic churches. The only prominent architectural feature is the small seven-towered semi-Byzantine cathedral, picturesquely situated on a rocky site overhanging the river; it was founded by Conrad Kurzbold, count of Niederlahngau, in 905, and finally consecrated in 1235 (restored 1872-78). Limburg has a seminary for the education of priests, and a variety of schools; the industries, which are unimportant, include manufactures of cloth, tobacco, machinery, pottery, and leather. The population in 1875 was 5161.

Limburg, which was a flourishing town during the Middle Ages, passed in 1404 into the possession of the archbishops of Treves after the extinction of its own line of counts, and in 1803 fell to the duke of Nassau. It was the scene of a victory of the archduke Charles of Austria over the French under Jourdain on September 16, 1796. It possesses an interesting MS. fragment of its chronicles, the Fasti JL·impurgenses. The original writer is supposed to have been the recorder Tillmann (ob. 1400), additions being made by subsequent copyists; the document, which has been more than once printed, is valuablè especially for the ancient rhymes it embodies, and for its notices of old German poets.
