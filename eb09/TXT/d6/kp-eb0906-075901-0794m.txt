DACIER, Andre (1651-1722), a French classical scholar, was the son of a Protestant advocate at Castres, and was born in that town in 1651. His father resolved to give him a learned education, and accordingly sent him first to the academy of Puy Laurens, and afterwards to Saumur, to study under Tanneguy Lefévre, who at that time enjoyed a considerable reputation as a teacher of classics. Such rapid progress did the young scholar make that, when Lefévre sent away all his other pupils, he kept Dacier for another entire year. On the death of Lefevre, Dacier removed to Paris; and he had the good fortune to be appointed one of the editors of the Delphin series of the classics. His marriage with the far more famous Anne Lefevre, the daughter of his old teacher, took place in 1683. In 1685 he announced, in a letter to the king, the conversion of himself and his wife to Roman Catholicism. As a reward Louis bestowed on him a pension of 1500 livres, and on his wife one of 500 livres. In 1695 Dacier was elected member of the Academy of Inscriptions, and also of the French Academy (of which in 1713 he became secretary); and not long after, as payment for his share in the Histoire de Louis le Grand par médailles, dec., he was appointed keeper of the library of the Louvre. He died, two years after his wife, on September 18, 1722.

Though endowed with none of the higher literary faculties, Dacier possessed great erudition. He was, as was wittily said, “un gros millet charge de tout le bagage de l’antiquité.” The most important of his works were his editions of Pompeius Festus and Valerius Flaccus, and his translations of Horace, with notes, of Aristotle’s Poetics, of the Electra and (Edipus of Sophocles, of Hippocrates, and of Plutarch.
