DALKEITH, a burgh of barony and market-town of Scotland, in the county of Edinburgh, situated between the North and South Esk, 6 J miles south-east of Edinburgh. The town is for the most part clean and well-built. The principal church, an old Gothic edifice, was originally the castle chapel; in 1406 it was raised to the dignity of a collegiate church, and after the Reformation it became the parish kirk. A new church in the Early English style, with a steeple 167 feet high, was built by the duke of Buccleuch in 1840; and there is an Episcopal chapel within the palace grounds. Dalkeith has one of the largest corn-markets in Scotland, held every Thursday. There are extensive corn-mills, breweries, iron-foundries, a brassfoundry, brickworks, and tanneries. In the vicinity is Dalkeith palace, the principal seat of the duke of Buccleuch. surrounded by an extensive park. It was the temporary residence of Charles I. in 1633, of George IV. in 1822, and of Queen Victoria in 1842. Population in 1871, 6386.
