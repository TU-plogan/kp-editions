DAMASK is a technical term applied to several distinct manufactures or manufacturing operations, from the fact that such products or operations were intimately connected with Damascus when that city was a great manufacturing centre. The principal application of the term is to variegated textile manufactures; and at the present day it generally indicates a twilled linen texture richly figured in the weaving with flowers, fruits, or ornamental scrolls, or with large designs of any description. The texture to which the name, however, was originally applied was of silk, with patterns elaborately woven in colours aud sometimes in gold thread.

“China, no doubt,” says Dr Rock (Catalogue of Textile Fabrics, South Kensington Museum), “was the first country to ornament its silken webs with a pattern. India, Persia, and Syria, then Byzantine Greece followed, but at long intervals between, in China’s footsteps. Stuffs so figured brought with them to the West the name ‘ diaspron ’ or diaper, bestowed upon them at Constantinople. But about the twelfth century the city of Damascus, even then long celebrated for its looms, so far outstripped all other places for beauty of design, that her silken textiles were in demand everywhere; and thus, as often happens, traders fastened the name of Damascen or Damask upon every silken fabric richly wrought and curiously designed, no matter whether it came or not from Damascus.”

Linen damasks, which are employed principally for table-cloths, napkins, and towels, are manufactured at Dunfermline, Kirkcaldy, and some other places in Fifeshire, Scotland; at Lisburn and Belfast, in Ireland; and in Holland, Belgium, and Russia. The fabric is usually woven in from four to eight leaf twills, that is with the weft intersecting the warp from every fourth up to every eighth thread; and the pattern is produced by varying the intersections on principles which will be explained under Weaving. Cotton damasks, in imitation of the linen manufactures, are now much woven and used for toilet covers and for similar purposes. Colours are frequently introduced in cotton damasks, manufactured in Glasgow and Paisley for dress purposes, and sent to the Indian and West Indian market. Silk damasks are manufactured for curtains and for other upholstery uses in all the great silk-weaving centres.
