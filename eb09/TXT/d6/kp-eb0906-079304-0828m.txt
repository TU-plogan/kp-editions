DAMAUN, a seaport town of Western India, in the Surat district, is a Portuguese settlement, although included within the geographical limits of the presidency of Bombay, in 20° 24' N. lat. and 72° 53' E. long. It is situated on the DamaungangA river, which rises in the Western GhAts, about 40 miles to the eastward. The river has a bar at its mouth, with only 2 feet of water at low spring tides and 18 or 20 feet inside. Outside the bar is a roadstead in which vessels may anchor in 8 fathoms. A rampart with 10 bastions and 2 gateways surrounds the town. The surrounding country is fruitful and pleasant except in the rainy season, when it is extensively inundated. Damaun was sacked and burnt by the Portuguese in 1531. It was subsequently rebuilt, and in 1558 was taken from the Indians by the Portuguese, who converted the mosque into a Christian church. From that time it has remained in their hands. The Portuguese territory surrounding the town is about ten miles in length from north to south, and about five in breadth.
