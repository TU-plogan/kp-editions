DAGGER, a weapon which, in relation to its comparatively short blade, may be considered a diminutive of the sword. Specially designed to inflict wounds by the act of stabbing, the dagger is sharp at the point, but it is equally adapted for cutting purposes with its keen edge. Al savage races have highly valued the dagger in some modifications of its simplest type; while at certain periods it has been included among the military weapons of civilized nations, and, in our own time, is well known as the dirk. Early in the 14th century a dagger straight in the blade, and called a misericorde— either because the sight of it caused the vanquished to cry out for mercy, or from its use in mercifully ending the sufferings of the hopelessly wounded—became a companion weapon to the sword among the knights of Europe; and, accordingly, from about 1330 till the end of the succeeding century, in many knightly effigies it is often represented as attached on the right side by a cord or a chain to the sword-belt. The misericorde varied in size, the length of the blade sometimes causing it to appear almost like a second sword, while at other times the blade and the hilt were nearly of equal length. This weapon and its sheath were often elaborately adorned. It was customary to secure it from accidental loss by a guard-chain fastened to a mamelliere of the breast-armour, of which chain the other end was secured to the hilt of the weapon by a ring either fixed on the apex of the pommel or travelling along the grip. Occasionally the misericorde was fixed to the body-armour by a staple; or, more rarely, it was connected with a gypciere or pouch. A similar weapon, with a longer blade than the ordinary misericorde, was habitually worn by civilians, including judges, during the Middle Ages; such weapons bore the name of anlace or basilarde. By nobles and knights the misericorde was worn when they had exchanged their armour for the costume of peace. It is recorded, besides, that when they appeared at a tournament, and on some other occasions, ladies at that time wore daggers depending, with their gyp-cieres, from their girdles. Thus, writing of the year 1348, Knighton speaks of certain ladies who were present at jousts as “habentes cultellos, quos daggerios vulgariter dicunt, in powchiis desuper impositis.” A sword having a blade much shorter than the principal knightly weapon of the same class, and distinguished as an estoc, which, like the civilian anlace or basilarde, may be considered to be a variety of the dagger, occasionally formed a part of the equipment of the mediaeval man-at-anns; and it is the scabbard of such a weapon that hangs as a characteristic memorial above the tomb and the effigy of the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral. Much ingenuity and skill have been lavished on the adornment of daggers, and in rendering the blades more capable of inflicting severe wounds. Daggers also were sometimes made to poison as well as wound. Some Italian daggers, of stiletto type, have the blade made to expand laterally, by the action of delicate and powerful springs. Others, like the cris of the Malays, have wavy blades.
