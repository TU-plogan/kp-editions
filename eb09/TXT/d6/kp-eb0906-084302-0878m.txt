DAVID HA-COHEN, a learned Rabbin, was born at Lara, in Spain, about the beginning of the 17th century, and died at Hamburg in 1674. He was chief of the synagogue at Amsterdam, and he afterwards held the same office at Hamburg. From this he was deposed on a suspicion of an intention to become a Christian, which seems to have been unfounded. It probably originated in the fact that he held more liberal sentiments than those which prevailed in the Jewish community of his time. David was the author of several works of value in the [9:6:844] department of rabbinical literature. The most important is the Corona Sacerdotum (Hamburg, 1667), a Talmudic and rabbinical dictionary, which was printed only as far as the letter Yod, though the author carried on the work to the letter Resh after forty yearsâ€™ labour. A small portion of the dictionary was printed at Amsterdam in 1648 as a specimen, with the title Civitas David.
