D’AUBIGNE, Jean-Henri Merle (1794-1872), was born 16th August 1794 at Eaux Vives, near Geneva. The ancestors of his father, François Merle, were French Protestant refugees; his paternal grandmother’s name, D’Aubigné, which Jean-Henri Merle subsequently added to his own, was a name well known in the service of Henry IV. Jean-Henri was destined by his parents to a commercial life; but the new interests awakened by his course at college led him to fix his choice on the office of the Christian ministry. The influence of Robert Haldane, a Scottish evangelist sojourning in Geneva, told powerfully and permanently on the divinity student, and kindled in him a hitherto unknown zeal for the distinctively evangelical truths of the Christian faith. When in 1817 Merle went abroad to further his education, Germany was about to celebrate the tercentenary of the Reformation; and thus early he conceived the ambition to write the history of that great epoch. At Berlin he received stimulus from teachers so unlike as were Neander and De Wette. After presiding for five years over the French Protestant church in Hamburg, he was in 1823 called to become pastor of a congregation in Brussels, and preacher to the court. At the Belgian revolution, he preferred pastoral work at home to an educational post in the family of the Dutch king; and, shortly after his return to Switzerland, events rendered it impossible for those like-minded with him in religious matters to remain in the national Genevese church. The separation took place finally in 1833, and Merle D'Aubigné became one of the founders of the new evangelical church; and, whether as pastor or as professor of church history in its theological seminary, he continued to be till the last days of his life an unwearied and influential labourer in the cause of his church and of evangelical Protestantism. In him the Evangelical Alliance found a hearty promoter. He made many friends in other lands, and repeatedly visited England; he was made a D.C.L. by Oxford University, and received civic honours from the city of Edinburgh. His many labours never impaired his healthy frame. In his seventy-ninth year he still enjoyed perfect vigour of mind and body; sudden death during the night of the 20th October 1872 removed him from the midst of academic and literary work.

It was as their historian that Merle D’Aubigné was most powerfully to serve the cause of the Protestant churches. The first section of his History of the Reformation, having for its central subject the earlier period of the work in Germany, gave its author at once a foremost rank amongst modern French ecclesiastical historians, was translated into most European tongues, and was much more widely read and admired in English-speaking lands than at home. It is said that 200,000 copies of the English translation were sold in Great Britain alone, and about twice as many in the United States. The second series of volumes, dealing with reform in the time of Calvin, was not less thorough than the former series, and had a subject hitherto less exhaustively treated; but it did not meet with a success so marked. This part of the subject, with which the Genevese professor was most competent effectively to deal, was all but completed at the time of his death. Along with the great work of his life, he had written many minor treatises on the themes he had most closely at heart. Of these the most important are a vindication of the character and aims of Oliver Cromwell, and a sketch of the contendings of the Kirk of Scotland.

Dr Merle D’Aubigné was in many ways well fitted to be a powerful and popular expositor of history, and especially of that history to which he devoted the studies of a lifetime. Indefatigable in exploring and sifting original documents, he had amassed a vast wealth of authentic information; but a desire to give everywhere a full and graphic picture, assisted by a gift of warm and genial imaginative power, betrayed him into aiming at fulness of picturesque detail concerning events and processes necessarily hidden from the eye of a strict historiographer. In a few cases he seems by inference from his knowledge of a later period to have filled up a narrative not sustained by documentary evidence. He was able in a marvellous manner to identify himself with the Reformers; but while his sympathies enabled him to do justice to great aims of good men, he too frequently becomes their apologist. His expressed desire everywhere to trace the working of God’s Spirit in the work of the Reformers leads him to pass too lightly over secondary but weighty influences, and in his heroes’’ opponents continually to discover the foes of God; and the devout purpose with which he confessedly wrote inspires his pages with much that is rather religious admonition than history, and causes a style otherwise simple and dignified to pass into fervid rhetoric. But his work remains a noble monument of painstaking sincerity and reverential love for a great subject. In the main it unquestionably brings us into direct contact with the genuine spirit of the most momentous period in the modern history of the Christian church.

Daubigné’s principal works are— Discours sur l'Étude de l'Histoire de Christianisme (Gen. 1832); Le Luthéranisme et la Reforme (Par. 1844); Germany, England, and Scotland, or Recollections of a Swiss Pastor (Lond. 1848); Trois Siécles de Lutte eu Écosse, ou deux Rote et deux Royaumes; Le Protecteur ou la République d'Angleterre aux jours de Cromwell (Par. 1848); Le Concile et l'Infaillibi-lité (1870) ; Histoire de la Reformation au XVIiéme Siécle (Par. 1835-53; new ed. 1861-62 in 5 vols.); and the Histoire de la Réformation en Europe au temps de Calvin (8 vols., 1862-1877).
