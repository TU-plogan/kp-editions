DAVID, Jean Pierre (1789-1856), usually called David d’Angers, a much-admired French sculptor, and, like David the painter, to whom he was in no other way related. a demonstrative partisan of advanced ideas in politics and religion, was born at Angers, 12th March 1789. His father was a sculptor, or rather a carver, but he had thrown aside the mallet and taken the musket, fighting against the Chouans of La Vendde. He returned to his trade at the end of the civil war, to find his customers gone, so that young David was born into poverty. As the boy grew up his father wished to force him into some more lucrative and certain way of life. At last he succeeded in surmounting the opposition to his becoming a sculptor, and in his eighteenth year left for Paris to study the art upon a fund of eleven francs. As far as we know his works, the genius on which he relied was not very great; but after struggling against want for a year and a half, he succeeded in taking the prize at the Ecole des Beaux Arts. Energy and perseverance stood in the place of natural ability, and now fortune aided him in the shape of an annuity of 600 francs (£24), granted by the municipality of his native town, by the name of which he was proud to be called ever after. This was in 1809, and in 1811 his Epaminondas gained the prize of Rome, where he spent five years, rather too much impressed by the works of Canova.

Returning from Rome about the time of the restoration of the Bourbons, he would not remain in the neighbourhood of the Tuileries, swarming with foreign conquerors and returned royalists; he found his way to London, having made several English acquaintances in Rome. Here, if we are to believe the statement in his biography, he was offered the commission to erect a monument commemorative of Waterloo,—more probably he received an invitation to offer a design for some such work, which he might misunderstand from his ignorance of English. At the same time his resources were exhausted; and Flaxman and others visited upon him the sins of David the painter, to whom he was supposed to be related. With great difficulty he made his way to Paris again, where a comparatively prosperous career opened upon him. His medallions and busts were in much request, and monumental works also came to him. One of the best of these was that of Gutenberg at Strasburg; but those he himself valued most were the statue of Barra, a drummer boy who fell in the war in La Vendee, who continued to beat his drum till the moment of death, and the monument to the Greek liberator Bozzaris. This was a young female figure he called “Reviving Greece,” of which his friend Victor Hugo says rather absurdly, “It is difficult to see anything more beautiful in the world; this statue joins the grandeur of Phidias to the expressive manner of Puget.” His busts and medallions were very numerous, and among his sitters may be found not only the illustrious men and women of France, but many others both of England and Germany—countries which he visited professionally in 1827 and 1829. His medallions, it is affirmed, number 500. He died on the 4th of January 1856.

David d’Angers was respected for his consistency and benevolence. As an example of the latter may be mentioned his rushing off to the sickbed of Rouget de Lille, the author of the Marseillaise llymn, modelling and carving him in marble without delay, making a lottery of the work, and possibly saving the poet’s life by sending him the proceeds, £72, when in the extremity of need.
