DANCE, the name of a family group important in English art, at least in architecture, during the latter half of the last century.

George Dance, senior, the father of the two others, was born early in the century, at a time when neither Gothic nor classic architecture was properly studied in England, the former being looked upon simply as a barbarism, and the latter known only through the Italian. On his return from the continent, after a short period of study, he obtained the appointment of architect to the city of London, and immediately had a chance of distinction by building the Mansion-house. This was in 1739, and his plans gave great satisfaction. It was followed by the churches of St Botolph, Aidgate, and St Leonard, Shoreditch, and by other city works of some importance. He continued to practise till his death, January 11, 1768, at which time the former excise offices, Broad Street, were approaching completion, and his son George was installed in his place, both his sons being already in considerable repute. Of these the eldest was

N athaniel Dance, born in 1734, who left his father’s office and was placed under Hayman, the genre-historical painter. Here he showed great quickness, but principally in portraits, and after a few years he left that painter and went abroad. His residence in Italy, which was prolonged for many years, brought him in contact with Angelica Kauffmann, among whose devoted admirers he long remained, at first following her about in all her changes of abode, travelling as she did under the protection of her loving old father. From Italy he sent home historical pictures occasionally, of the quasiclassic sort,—Dido and Aeneas in 1763, for example. These he continued to produce all through his career,—Paris and Helen (1771), Orpheus lamenting Eurydice (1774), Death of Mark Antony (1776),—all of which have long ago utterly disappeared. He was settled in London in 1768, as his name appears among the founders of the Royal Academy, and must have been in the country some time, as he exhibits two full-length portraits of George III. and the queen in the first exhibition of that body. These are now existing at Up Park, Sussex; and in the Greenwich Hospital picture gallery is a portrait of Captain Cook by him. Many of his pictures are known in family collections throughout the country, and some of his works, now lost sight of, are known by engravings. At the age of fifty-six, when he had himself made a large fortune, he married a widow possessing a jointure of £15,000 a year, entirely dropt his profession, and became a member of Parliament, representing East Grinstead. He even changed his name, and when made a baronet in 1800 he appeared as Sir N. D. Holland. He now lived at Carnborough House, near Winchester, his only practice in art being occasional landscapes in the manner of the day; and at that place he died suddenly on the 15th October 1811, leaving a private fortune of £200,000. His brother, George Dance, junior, by far the ablest of the three, was born in 1740, and remained his father’s pupil, succeed ing him as city surveyor and architect in 1768. At that time the office, then as now somewhat lucrative, was purchasable, and it was in that way he acquired the appointment. He was then only twenty-eight, and had spent several years abroad, most of the time with his brother in Italy, yet he had already distinguished himself by designs for public works, particularly that for Blackfriars Bridge. He was associated with his brother in the foundation of the Royal Academy, and, living till 1825, he was for a number of years the last survivor of the original members. Knowing every one connected with art in London for a long period, he must have outlived a great many changes in taste, and seen many novelties pass away in all the divisions of art. In his own sphere the revolution from [9:6:802] his father’s style to the study of Gothic by the elder Pugin and others, following the period of Stuart and Revett, showed a wonderful development, especially in the precise knowledge of ornamental details. In sculpture, the passage from Carlini to Flaxman was even more rapid, and in painting he must have known all the important professors from Hogarth to Wilkie. That he was much interested in all these changes is proved by the series of portraits of his friends, principally artists, he drew from the life, which are now preserved in the library of the Academy. Seventy-two of these, engraved in imitation of chalk, were published in 1808-14, and form a very interesting collection. In his own profession his time was mainly occupied by his duties as city architect, and his principal works are such as came to him in that way. Of these, the prison of Newgate, rebuilt in 1770, a building unique in design, is the most conspicuous and able. The front of Guildhall is also his. He died January 14, 1825, and was buried in St Paul’s.
