DANIELL, Thomas, William, and Samuel. This family of landscape painters forms a group which has left one record, so to speak, in our annals of art, not by their pictures exactly, but by the three having been all travellers in the East, and publishing, by means of engraving, works illustrating the scenery of the countries they visited.

Thomas Daniell (1749-1840), to whom the others were indebted for everything, was a man of versatile ability and enormous energy. He was the maker of his own fortune, having been born at the Chertsey inn, kept by his father, in 1749, and apprenticed to an heraldic painter, a trade then dying out, like that of stay-maker or perukier at a later time. However profitable it had been, probably Daniell would not have adhered to it, as he was animated, at a time when the representation of natural scenery under atmospheric conditions of effect was merely struggling into existence, with a love of the romantic and beautiful in architecture and nature. The sentimental affectation for landscape, so cleverly satirized by Lord Macaulay, did not indeed influence him; his bias was towards archaeology and botany, and led him at last to India. Up to 1784 he painted topographical subjects and flower pieces. By this time his two nephews had come under his influence, the youngest being apprenticed to Medland the landscape engraver, and the elder, William, was under his own care. In this year (1784) he embarked for India accompanied by the boy, and found at Calcutta ample encouragement. Here he remained ten years, and on returning to London he published his largest work, Oriental Scenery, in six large volumes, not completed till 1808. From 1795 till 1828 he continued to exhibit Eastern subjects, temples, jungle hunts, &c., and at the same time continued the publication of illustrated works. These are— Views of Calcutta; Oriental Scenery, 144 plates; Views in Egypt; Excavations at Ellora; Picturesque Voyage to China. These were for the most part executed by an engraving process now almost forgotten, called aquatint, and, although they do not show the accuracy of detail now understood, are valuable authorities. He was made Royal Academician in 1799, fellow of the Royal Society about the same time, and at different times member of several minor societies. His nephews both died before him; his Indian period had made him independent, and he lived a bachelor life in much respect at Kensington till the age of ninety-one, dying 19th March 1840.

William Daniell (1769-1837), nephew of Thomas, was born 1769, and was therefore fourteen when he accompanied his uncle to India. His own publications, engraved in aquatint, were— Voyage to India; Zoography; Animated Nature; Views of London; Views of Bootan, a work prepared from his uncle’s sketches; and a Voyage Round Great Britain, which occupied him several years. The British Institution made him an honorary award of £100 for a Battle of Trafalgar, and he was elected R.A. in 1822. He turned to panorama painting before his death, beginning in 1832 with Madras, the picture being enlivened by the Hindu mode of taming wild elephants. He died 16th August 1837.

Samuel Daniell, William’s younger brother, born 1775, was brought up as an engraver, and first appears as an exhibitor in 1792. A few years later he went to the Cape and travelled into the interior of Africa, with his sketching materials in his haversack. The drawings he made there were published, after his return, in his African Scenery. He did not rest long at home, but left for Ceylon in 1806, where he spent the remaining years of his life, publishing The Scenery, Animals, and Natives of Ceylon. Camping out and malaria from the swamps cut him off after a few days, illness in December 1811.
