DAVID, Felicien Cesar (1810-1876), a French composer, was born at Cadenet, in the department of Vaucluse, March 8, 1810. As a child he exhibited proofs of unusual precocity, and at the age of four had made considerable progress in his musical studies. Being early left an orphan, and totally unprovided for, he obtained, through the influence of relatives, admission to the choir of Saint-Sauveur at Aix. Subsequently he entered into the employment of an attorney, but quitted his service to become successively chef d'orchestre in the theatre at Aix, and chapel master of the church in which he had formerly appeared as a humble chorister. He next proceeded to Paris, where he subsisted for some time on a pittance of 50 francs a month, afforded him by a rich but miserly uncle. After pursuing diligently a course of studies at the Conservatoire under Fdtis, Reber, and others, he cast in his lot with the Saint-Simonians, and on the dispersion of that sect in 1833 accompanied several of the brethren on a fruitless expedition to the East. The immediate result of this tour was the publication, on his return to Paris, of the Melodies Orientates, which met with little encouragement. Nine years after this, however, the musical world was suddenly startled by the production of the Desert, a work abounding in graceful melodies, and affording proof of an extensive acquaintance with orchestral effects. This ode-symphony, as it was called, rapidly gained for the composer a widespread reputation. It was, after some vexatious delays, first performed at the Conservatoire in 1844, and quickly found a hearing in every European capital. Enthusiasts were not slow to predict for David a brilliant career, but their hopes were scarcely realized. Nothing the composer afterwards wrote at all equalled the Desert. In the Christophe Colomb (1847) there are noble passages, and the comic opera of Latta Rookh possesses numbers graced by a captivating delicacy of orchestration, but neither for these nor for his other principal works— Moise au Mont Sinai (1846), La Perle du Bresil (1851), and Herculaneum (1859)—can a place be claimed in the foremost ranks of composition. They were of sufficient merit, however, to gain for him the biennial prize of the emperor, which was awarded by the French Institute in 1868. In the following year he was appointed to the post of librarian at the Conservatoire, vacated by M. Berlioz, whom he afterwards succeeded as a member of the Institute. He died on the 29th of August 1876, aged sixty-six.
