DAILLE [Dallas], Jean (1594-1670), one of themost learned Protestant divines of the 17th century, was born at Cluitellerault, in January 1594, and received his education at Poitiers and Saumur. For seven years from 1612 he was tutor to two of the grandsons of the illustrious M. du Plessis Momay, and in 1619 he accompanied them in a tour through Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Flanders, Holland, and England, which lasted for two years. Having been ordained to the ministry in 1623, he preached for some time in the family of M. du Blessis Momay; and on the death of his patron he devoted himself to the grateful task of drawing up his Memoirs. In 1625 Dailld was appointed minister of the church of Saumur, and in 1626 he removed to Paris. Of his works, which are principally controversial, the most important is the celebrated treatise Du vrai Emploi des Peres (1631), translated into English by Thomas Smith under the title On the Use of the Fathers (1651). In 1656 it appeared in Latin. The work is a most effective attack on the views of those who made the authority of the fathers conclusive on matters of faith and practice. Dail 16 shows that their text is often corrupt, and that even when the text is correct their reasoning is often weak and inconsequent. He was greatly esteemed, even by his antagonists; and his mild and amiable disposition, united to his learning and genius, led Balzac to exclaim, Cum talis sis, utinam nosier esses.‚Äù In his famous Sermons on the Philippians and Colossians, Daille has vindicated his claim to be ranked as one of the first of preachers, as well as one of the most able of polemics. Daille was president of the last national synod held in France, which met in 1659. In the discussions which occurred he defended the universalism of Amyraut. His Apologie des Synodes d'Alenconet de Charenton (1655) was devoted to the same object. Among his other works were an Apologie pour les Eglises Ileformees and La Foy fondee sur les Sainte Ecritures. Dailies life was written by his son Adrien, who retired to Zurich at the revocation of the Edict of Nantes.
