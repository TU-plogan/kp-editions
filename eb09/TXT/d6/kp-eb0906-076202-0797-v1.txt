DAHL, Michael (1656-1743), the only celebrated Scandinavian portrait painter of his time, was born at Stockholm in 1656. He received his first professional education from Ernst Klocke, who had a respectable position in that northern town, which, however, Dahl left in his twenty-second year. His first destination was England, where he did not long remain, but crossed over to Paris and made his way at last to Rome, there taking up his abode for a considerable time, painting the portraits of Queen Christina and other celebrities. In 1688 he returned to England, with an established character, and became for some years a dangerous rival to Kneller. His portraits still exist in mauy houses, but his name is not always preserved with them. Nagler (Kiinstler-Lexicon) says those at Hampton Court and at Petworth contest the palm with those of the better known and vastly more employed painter. Some of his pictures have been engraved. He died in 1743, in his eighty-seventh year.
