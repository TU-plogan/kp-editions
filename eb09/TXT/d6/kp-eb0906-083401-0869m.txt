D’AUBUSSON, Pierre (1423-1503), a grand master of the order of St John of Jerusalem, celebrated for the zeal and ability with which he opposed the Turks, was born in 1423. He belonged to a noble French family, and early devoted himself to the career of a soldier; but his history is involved in obscurity till he entered the order of which he was to become the head. Having distinguished himself greatly against the pirates of the Levant, in 1458 he was chosen to conduct an embassy to Charles VII., a duty which he performed with much success. He was after this appointed to the most important offices in the order, and, finally, in 1476, was by an almost unanimous vote elected grand-master. It was the period of the conquests of Mahomet II., who, supreme in the East, now began to threaten Europe. In December 1479 a large Turkish fleet, under Misach Palaeologus, appeared in sight of Rhodes; a landing was effected, and a vigorous attack made upon the city. But in July of the next year, being reinforced from Spain, the knights forced the Mussulmans to retire. D’Aubusson had been dangerously wounded in one of the numerous and severe fights which had taken place; but in a few weeks he had so far recovered as to be able to address to the emperor of the East an account of the siege, which raised his renown to the highest point throughout Europe. Soon after, Mahomet II. died, leaving his kingdom to be disputed between his sons Bajazet and Zizim. The latter, finding himself unable to achieve success, sought the aid of D’Aubusson, who, in 1482, received him with great display, but took advantage of his confidence to detain him a prisoner. He was afterwards sent to France, and finally handed over to the Pope, who rewarded D’Aubusson with a cardinal’s hat, and with the power of conferring all benefices connected with the order without the sanction of the papacy, and also suppressed the orders of St Sepulchre and St Lazarus, and bestowed their wealth on the order of St John. For some years D’Aubusson devoted himself to regulating the affairs of his order, so that it might retain the spirit of lofty enthusiasm which originally animated it, and by which he was himself inspired, and defending its interests from the bad faith of the Popes; but in 1501, being appointed generalissimo of the Christian armies against the Turk, he sailed to attack Mitylene. The forces he commanded, however, he found it impossible to bring into agreement; and the expedition proved a failure. The measure to which the rest of his life was mainly devoted was an attempt to expel Judaism from Rhodes, by banishing the adult Jews and forcibly baptizing the children. He died in the summer of 1503.
