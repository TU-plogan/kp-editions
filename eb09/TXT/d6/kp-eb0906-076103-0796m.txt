D’AGUESSEAU, Henri Francois (1668-1751), chancellor of France, illustrious for his virtues, learning, and talents, was born at Limoges on the 27th of November 1668. Under the careful supervision of his father, a man of great worth and ability, who held the posts of intendant of Languedoc and councillor of state, D’Aguesseau devoted himself to study with great ardour and with extraordinary results. When little more than twenty-one years of age he was, through his father’s influence with the king, appointed one of the three advocates-general; and the eloquence and learning which he displayed in his first speech gained him a very lofty reputation, which was well sustained by his [9:6:762] subsequent career. The chosen companions of his leisure hours were Racine and Boileau, the latter of whom frequently mentions him with high praise.

In 1700 he was appointed procurator-general; and in this office, which he filled for seventeen years, he gained the greatest popularity by his lenity in criminal cases, and by his care of the public hospitals. In 1717 he was made chancellor by the Regent Orleans; but it was only a year after that he was deprived of the seals, and exiled to his estate, on account of his steady opposition to the projects of the famous John Law, which had been adopted by the regent and his ministers. In 1720, however, on the failure of these schemes, he was recalled; and he contributed not a little, by the firmness and sagacity of his counsels, to calm the public disturbance and repair the mischief which had been committed. Law himself had acted as the messenger of his recall; and it is said that D’Aguesseau’s consent to accept the seals from his hand greatly diminished his popularity. But his reputation was much more severely shaken by his conduct in connection with the bull “Unigenitus,” a measure which, with distinguished bravery, he had himself opposed during the life of the late king. He allowed the Great Council to assume the power of registration, which legally belonged to the Parliament alone; and he assisted Dubois, the favourite of the regent, in his endeavour to force the Parliament to register the bull, though he refused to sanction the extreme measure of exiling the Parliament, which Dubois had contemplated. Dislike of the Jansenists, and desire to put an end to the religious controversies which were raging so bitterly, were probably the motives which, in part at least, influenced D’Aguesseau; but the people unjustly attributed his conduct to a base compliance with the favourite. He certainly opposed Dubois in other matters; and when Dubois became chief minister, D’Aguesseau was deprived of his office.

He retired to his estate at Fresnes, where he passed five years, of which he always spoke with delight. The Scriptures, which he read and compared in various languages, and the jurisprudence of his own and other countries, formed the subjects of his more serious studies; the rest of his time was devoted to philosophy, literature, and gardening.

From these occupations he was recalled to court, by the advice of Cardinal Fleury, in 1727; but the seals were not restored to him till ten years later. During these years he endeavoured to mediate in the disputes between the court and the Parliament. When he was at last reinstated in office, he completely withdrew from all political affairs, and devoted himself entirely to his duties as chancellor, and to the achievement of those reforms which had long occupied his thoughts. Besides some important enactments regarding donations, testaments, and successions, he introduced various regulations for improving the forms of procedure, for ascertaining the limits of jurisdictions, and for effecting a greater uniformity in the execution of the laws throughout the several provinces. These reforms constitute an epoch in the history of French jurisprudence, and have placed the name of D’Aguesseau in the same rank with those of L’Hopital and Lamoignon. As a magistrate also he was so conscientious that Saint-Simon has complained that he spent too much time over the cases that came before him.

In 1750, when upwards of eighty-two years of age, D’Aguesseau retired from the duties without giving up the rank of chancellor. He died on the 9th February of the following year.

The published writings of D’Aguesseau form a collection of thirteen volumes quarto, of which the first was published at Paris in 1759, and the last in 1789. The far greater part relates to matters connected with his profession, but they also contain an elaborate treatise on money; several theological essays; a life of his father, which is interesting from the account which it gives of his own early education; and Metaphysical Meditations, written to prove that, independently of all revelation and all positive law, there is that in the constitution of the human mind which renders jnan a law to himself.
