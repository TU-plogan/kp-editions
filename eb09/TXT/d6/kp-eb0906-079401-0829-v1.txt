DAMIETTA, or, as it is called by the natives, Damiat, a town of Lower Egypt, on the great eastern branch of the Nile, about six miles from its mouth (the ancient Ostium Phatniticum), and nearly 100 miles from Cairo, with which it is connected by rail. After the metropolis and Alexandria, Damietta is the largest town in Egypt, and contains a population of about 29,000, consisting for the most part of Egyptians, with a few Greeks and Syrians. The town, as a whole, is ill-built and straggling, and is only redeemed from meanness by the presence of some handsome mosques, bazaars, and public baths. The houses of the better classes are brick edifices situated on the water-edge, and furnished with terraces, on which the inmates enjoy the cool riverbreezes of the evening. The general trade of Damietta was at one time considerable, but has in great part been absorbed by Alexandria. It has still, however, a considerable coasting trade with Syria and the Levant, and forms the outlet for the rice and flax grown in the surrounding country. The lake Menzaleh yields large supplies of fish, which are dried and salted, and furnish an important article of export trade. Coffee and dates are the other articles most largely exported. Mehemet Ali established a military school in the town with accommodation for 400 pupils, as also a cotton factory and an extensive rice-mill. Damietta is a corruption of the word Thamiatis. The original town was four miles nearer the sea than the modern city, and first rose into importance on the decay of Pelusium. When it passed into the hands of the Saracens it became a place of great wealth and commerce, and was therefore frequently attacked by the crusaders. The most remarkable of these sieges lasted eighteen months, from June 1218 to November 1219; another in 1249 was conducted in person by Louis IX. of France, who, however, was soon after taken prisoner and compelled to purchase his freedom by restoring the city to its Saracen owners. To obviate these attacks the Egyptian Sultan Bibars blocked up the Phatnitic mouth of the Nile (about 1260), razed old Damietta to the ground, and transferred the inhabitants to the site of the modern town. From this circumstance large ships cannot now sail up the Nile, and are obliged to discharge their cargoes outside the bar. The French took possession of the town in 1798, and in the following year beat the Turks in the neighbourhood; but they were expelled by the English under Sir Sydney Smith.
