DARBOY, Georges (1813-1871), archbishop of Paris, was born at Fayl-Billot in Haut Marne on the 16th January 1813. He studied with distinction at the seminary at Langres, and was ordained priest in 1836. After filling a charge at St Dizier, near Vassy, he was appointed in 1839 professor of philosophy at Langres, and in 1841 he was transferred to the chair of dogmatics. A change in the direction of the seminary caused him to leave for Paris, where in 1846 he was appointed almoner of the college of Henry IV. and honorary canon of Notre Dame. The confidence thus shown in him by Archbishop Afire was continued by Archbishop Sibour, who appointed him editor of the Moniteur Catholique. In November 1854 th©

archbishop took Darboy with him to Rome and presented him to the Pope, who gave him the rank of protonotary apostolic. In 1855 he became titular vicar-general of Paris, and inspector of religious instruction in the various schools of the diocese. He was appointed bishop of Nancy in 1859, and in January 1863 he was raised to the archbishopric of Paris. The favour of the court was indicated by his appointment to the post of grand almoner to the emperor in 1866, and to that of grand officer to the Legion of Honour in 1868. The archbishop was a strenuous upholder of episcopal independence in the Gallican sense, and involved himself in a controversy with Rome by his endeavours to suppress the jurisdiction of the Jesuits and other religious orders within his diocese. At the Vatican Council he vigorously maintained the rights of the bishops, and offered a decided opposition to the infallibility dogma, against which he voted as inopportune. When the dogma had been finally adopted, however, he was one of the first to set the example of submission. Immediately after his return to Paris the war with Prussia broke out, and his conduct during the disastrous year that followed Xvas marked by a devoted heroism which has secured for him an enduring fame. He was active in organizing relief for the wounded at the commencement of the war, remained bravely at his post during the seige, and refused to seek safety by flight during the brief triumph of the commune. On the 4th April 1871 he was arrested by the communists as a hostage, and confined in the prison at Mazas, from which he was transferred to La Roquette on the advance of the army of Versailles. On the 27th May he was shot within the prison along with several other distinguished hostages. He died in the attitude of blessing and uttering words of forgiveness. His body was recovered with difficulty, and having been embalmed was buried with imposing ceremony at the public expense on the 7th June. It is a noteworthy fact that Darboy was the third archbishop of Paris who perished by violence in the period between 1848 and 1871. Darboy was the author of a number of works, of which the most important are a Vie de St Thomas Becket (1859), a translation of the works of St Denis the Areopagite, and a translation of the Imitation of Christ.
