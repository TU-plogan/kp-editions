DAHL, Johann Christian (1778-1857), a landscape painter, born in Bergen, Norway, on the 24th February 1778. He began painting in his native town, and formed his style without much tuition, remaining there till he was twenty-four, when he left for the better field of Copenhagen, and ultimately settled in Dresden in 1818. He is usually included in the German school, although he was thus close on forty years of age when he finally took up his abode in Dresden, where he was quickly received into the Academy and became professor. German landscape-, painting was not greatly advanced at that time, and Dahl contributed to improve it. He continued to reside in Dresden, though he travelled into Tyrol and in Italy, painting many pictures, one of his best works being that of the Outbreak of Vesuvius, 1820. What his works want is the careful expression of nature in its normal conditions. He was fond of extraordinary effects, as seen in his Winter at Munich, and his Dresden by Moonlight; also the Haven of Copenhagen, and the Schloss of Friedrichsburg, under the same condition. At Dresden may be seen many of his works; a large picture called Norway may be mentioned, and a Storm at Sea. He was received into several academic bodies, and had the orders of Wasa and St Olaf sent him by the king of Norway and Sweden. His death took place in 1857.
