DAHLGREN, Karl Fredrik (1791-1844), the Swedish poet, was born at Stensbruk in Ostergotland June 20, 1791. At the time when literary partizanship ran so high in Sweden, and the writers divided themselves into “Goths” and “Phosphorists,” Dahlgren came over to the latter body, aud made himself indispensable by his polemical activity. In the mock-heroic poem of Markalls somnlosa natter (Markall’s Sleepless Nights), in which the Phosphorists bitterly, and with eminent success, ridiculed their opponents, Dahlgren, who was a genuine humourist, took a very prominent part. In 1825 he published The Tower of Babel, a satire, and in the same year, a comedy, Argus in Olympus. In 1828 he collected the scattered poems of his youth into two volumes. In 1829 he was appointed to an ecclesiastical post in Stockholm, which he held until his death. In a series cf odes and dithyrambic pieces, entitled Mollbergs Epistlar (1819,1820), he strove to emulate the wonderful lyric genius of Bellman, of whom he was a student and follower. From 1825 to 1827 he edited a critical journal entitled Kometen (The Comet), and he is also the author of a comic novel, Nahum Fredrik Bergstrom's Chronicle, which is said to be extremely witty. In company with Almqvist he founded the celebrated Manhems-forbund, a society of agricultural socialists, which had but a short tenure of existence. In 1834 he collected his poems in one volume; and in 1837 appeared his last book, a volume entitled Steamboat Songs. On the 1st of May 1844 he died at Stockholm. Dahlgren is one of the best humorous writers that Sweden has produced; but it was perhaps in realistic and idyllic description that his peculiar talents displayed themselves to most advantage. His little poem of Zephyr and the Girl, which is to be found in every selection from Swedish poetry, is a good example of his sensuous and ornamented style, as well as of his ease and vivacity. His works were collected and published after his death by A. J. Arwidsson.
