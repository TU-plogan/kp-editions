DALIN, Olof von (1708-1763), a Swedish poet, was born August 29, 1708, in the parish of Vinberg, in Halland, being the son of the incumbent. His mother was the daughter of a Dr Auadn, to whom Queen Christina had offered, during her exile in Rome, a cardinal’s hat if he joined the Romish Church. He was also nearly related to a still more remarkable man, Rydelius, the philosophical bishop of Lund, and the young Dalin was sent at a very early age to be instructed by him, Linnaeus being one of his fellow-pupils. The quick instinct of Rydelius instantly perceived the boy’s extraordinary genius, and he assisted its development in every possible way. While studying deeply at Lund, Dalin had visited Stockholm in the year 1723, and in 1726 he proceeded thither for the purpose of entering one of the public offices. Under the patronage of Baron Ralamb he rapidly rose to preferment, and his skill and intelligence won him golden opinions. It was at the age of twenty-four that he commenced his literary career by the publication of a work that was entirely new at that time in Sweden, namely the famous Argus, a weekly journal, founded on the model of Addison’s Spectator. For the two years 1733, 1734, Dalin issued his brilliant paper; at the end of 1733 he had thought to give it over, but he was forced to continue by the importunity of the public. It was not till 1736 that the secret was known, and Dalin confessed that he had been the writer of Argus. His reputation thereupon became immense. His next work was Tankar omKritiker (Thoughts about Critics), the first really aesthetic book brought out in Sweden. With the avowed purpose of enlarging the horizon of his cultivation and tastes, Dalin set off, in company with his pupil, Baron Ralamb’s son, on a tour through Germany and France, in 1739-40. On his return the shifting of political life at home caused him to write his famous satiric allegories of The Story of the Horse and April-Work, which were very popular, and provoked countless imitations. He now set himself to work on the most considerable of his writings, his didactic epos of Svenska ffriheten (Swedish Liberty), which first appeared in 1742. Hitherto Addison and Pope had been his models; in this work he draws his inspiration from Thomson, whose poem of Liberty it emulated. In 1751 Dalin received the honourable post of tutor to the crown prince, afterwards Gustavus III., and gained the friendship of'the literary Crown Princess Louisa Ulrika. His position at court gave rise to many personal inconveniences, and separated him to a vexatious degree from the studies in which he had hitherto been absorbed. He held the post of tutor to the crown prince until 1756, when he was arrested on suspicion of having taken part in the attempted revolution of that year, and tried for his life. He was acquitted, but was forbidden on any pretence to show himself at court. This period of exile, which lasted until 1761, Dalin spent in the preparation of his great historical work. He had been ennobled in 1751, and made privy counsellor in 1753; and now, in 1761, he once more took his place at court. During his exile, however, his spirit and his health had been broken; in a fit of panic he had destroyed some packets of his best unpublished works, and this he constantly brooded over. On the 12th of August 1763 he died at his house in Drottningholm. In the year 1767 his writings in belles lettres issued in six volumes, edited by Bokman, his half-brother. Amid an enormous mass of occasional verses, anagrams, epigrams, impromptus, and the like, his satires and serious poems were almost buried. But some of these former, even, are found to be songs of remarkable grace and delicacy, and many display a love of natural scenery and a knowledge of its forms truly remarkable in that artificial age. His dramas also are of interest, particularly his admirable comedy of The Envious Man; he also wrote a tragedy, Brynhilda, or the Unfortunate Love, and a pastoral in three scenes on King Adolphus Frederick’s return from Finland. During the early part of his life he was universally admitted to facile princeps among the Swedish poets of his time; in his later days the extravagant reputation of the poetess Hedvig Nordenflycht somewhat eclipsed his glory. He possessed a singular mixture of the literary qualities which we attribute severally to Pope, to Voltaire, and to Thomson. As a prose writer, Dalin is chiefly memorable for his History of the Swedish Kingdom,, which proceeds to the end of the reign of Charles IX.
