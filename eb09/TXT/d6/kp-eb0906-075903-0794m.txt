DA COSTA, Isaak (1798-1860), a Dutch poet and theologian, was born at Amsterdam on the 14th January 1798. His father was a Jew of Portuguese descent, through whom he claimed kindred with the celebrated Uriel D’Acosta. He studied at Amsterdam, and afterwards at Leyden, where he took his doctor’s degree in law in 1818. Before this he had given evidence of poetical talent, and had become acquainted with Bilderdijk, who exercised the strongest influence over him both in poetry and in theology. He was in fact the imitator as well as the scholar of Bilderdijk. In 1822 he became a convert to Christianity, and immediately afterwards asserted himself as a champion of orthodoxy in his Bezwaren tegen den Geest der Eeuw (1823), which was an attack upon the prevalent latitudinarianism in doctrine. He took a lively interest in missions to the Jews, and towards the close of his life was a director of the seminary established at Amsterdam in connection with the mission of the Free [9:6:760] Church of Scotland. He died at Amsterdam on the 28th April 1860. Da Costa ranked first among the poets of Holland after the death of Bilderdijk. His principal poetical works were Alphonsus I. (1821), a tragedy ; Poesji (1821); God met ons (1826), Festliedern (1828); Vijf-en-twintig Jaren (1840); Ilagar (1852); De Slag van Nieu-poort (1857), and De Mensch en-de Dichter. He also translated the Prometheus of JEschylus, and edited the poetical works of Bilderdijk in 16 volumes. He was the author of a number of theological works, chiefly in connection with the criticism of the gospels.
