DAMON, a Pythagorean, celebrated for his disinterested affection for Pythias, or Phyntias, a member of the same sect. Condemned to death by Dionysius I. of Syracuse, Pythias begged to be set at liberty for a short time that he might arrange his affairs. Damon pledged his life for the return of his friend; and Pythias faithfully returned before the appointed day of execution. The tyrant, to express his admiration of their fidelity, released both the friends, and begged to be admitted to their friendship.
