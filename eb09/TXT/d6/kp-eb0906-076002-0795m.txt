D/ED AL US, from the identity of his name with SaiSdAAeu', “to carve,” and SatSaXa, “carved images,” appears to have been, not a real person, but a legendary representative of the art of carving and sculpture in Greece in the time before Homer, who speaks of him (Iliad, xviii. 590) as having made a “chorus” for Ariadne in Crete, which Hephaestus took as the model of his “chorus,” or dance, on the shield of Achilles. Works of art of an extremely early date, but especially wooden images of deities, were ascribed to Daedalus or his descendants, and there were many traditions of the wonders he had done in sculpture. Most of the tools used in wood carving and sculpture were believed to have been invented by him. He was the first to open the eyes of statues, so that they seemed to look at the spectator, and to separate the legs so that they seemed to walk. A statue of Heracles by him had to be tied to prevent its running away, when the hero, angry at its resemblance to himself, threw a stone at it. The greater freedom which early Greek artists introduced into their figures was always contrasted with the stiffness of Egyptian statues, and hence it was necessary for the legend to represent Daedalus as having been some time in Egypt. Two of the earliest centres of art in Greece were Crete and Attica, and in the legends of both, Daedalus is involved, the story being that he had fled from Athens after killing his skilful nephew Talus, had gone to Crete in the time of Minos, had there constructed the famous labyrinth, and made a “chorus” for Ariadne and a cow for Pasiphae, and had been then thrown into prison, but escaped along with his son Icarus by means of wings. Icarus, however, fell into the sea and perished. Daedalus reached Sicily, where, protected by the king against Minos, who pursued him, he is said to have constructed several important works.
