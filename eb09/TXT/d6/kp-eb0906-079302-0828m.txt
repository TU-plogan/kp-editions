DAMASKEENING, or Damascening, is the art of incrusting wire of gold (and sometimes of silver) on the surface of iron, steel, or bronze. The surface upon which the pattern is to be traced is finely undercut with a sharp instrument, and the gold thread by hammering is forced into and securely held by the minute furrows of the cut surface. This system of ornamentation is peculiarly Oriental, having been much practised by the early goldsmiths of Damascus. It is still eminently characteristic of Persian metal work.
