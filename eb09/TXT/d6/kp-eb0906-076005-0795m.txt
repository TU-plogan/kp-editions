DAGHESTAN, a government in Asiatic Russia, on the eastern slopes of the Caucasus, bounded by Circassia, Grusia or Georgia, and the Caspian. As its name implies, it is of a very rugged and mountainous character, with the exception of a narrow strip along the sea-coast. It is watered by the tributaries of the Sulakand other streams that find their way to the Caspian. The district is geologically of great interest, and its strata have been investigated by Abich in his Sur la structure et la geologie du Daghestan, 1862. Lead, iron, and sulphur are worked to some extent The chief town is Derbent. See Caucasus, vol. v. p. 254.
