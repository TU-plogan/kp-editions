DAMASCENUS, Nicolaus, a Greek historian and philosopher, born at Damascus, from which he is named. He flourished in the time of Augustus and Herod the Great, with both of whom he was on terms of friendship. He enjoyed the intimate confidence of Herod, who studied philosophy along with him, and employed him on an important political mission to Augustus. Nicolaus survived Herod, and it was through his influence that the succession was secured for Archelaus; but the date of his death, like that of his birth, is unknown. Of his principal work, a universal history in 144 books, composed at the request of Herod, only a few fragments remain. He wrote also an autobiography, of which a good deal has been preserved, a life of Augustus, a life of Herod, and several philosophical works, which are known to us only through a few extracts in other writers. The first edition of the fragments of Nicolaus in a Latin version appeared at Geneva in 1593. The standard edition is that of Orelli (Leipsic, 1804) with a supplement (1811). The volume published in 1804 contains a notice of the life of Nicolaus by the Abb√© Sevin.
