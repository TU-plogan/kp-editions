DAMASK STEEL, or Damascus Steel, has a peculiar â€¢watered or streaked appearance, as seen in the blades of fine swords and other weapons of Oriental manufacture. Several methods of producing the damask grain may be pursued successfully, one of which is described under Cutlery. The art of producing damask steel has been generally practised in Oriental countries from a remote period, the most famous blades having come from Ispahan, Khorasan, and Shiraz in Persia. With great brightness and ductility the metal combines peculiar elasticity, and a capacity for taking and retaining a very fine edge.
