DAPHNE, in Greek mythology, was the daughter of a river-god, usually the Arcadian Ladon, sometimes the Thessalian Peneus, her mother being Gaea, the goddess of the earth. As usual with nymphs of springs or rivers she was pursued by lovers,â€”first by Leucippus, a son of CEnomaus, who disguised himself as a girl to be able to follow her better, but was discovered and killed by the nymphs with Daphne, and secondly by Apollo, from whom she escaped, being transformed into a laurel tree (8d</>in?).
