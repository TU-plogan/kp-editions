VARNHAGEN VON ENSE, Karl August (1785- 1858), German biographer, was born at Düsseldorf on 21st February 1785. He went to Berlin to study medicine, but devoted his attention chiefly to philosophy and literature, which he afterwards studied more thoroughly at Hamburg, Halle, and Tübingen. He began his literary career in 1804 as joint-editor with A. von Chamisso of a Musenalmanach. In 1809 he joined the Austrian army, and was wounded at the battle of Wagram. Soon afterwards he accompanied his superior officer, Prince Bentheim, to Paris, where he carried on his studies. In 1812 he joined the Prussian civil service at Berlin, but in the following year resumed his military career, this time as a captain in the Russian army. He accompanied Tettenborn to Hamburg and Paris, and his experiences were recorded in his Geschichte der Hamburger Ereignisse (1813) and his Geschichte der Kriegszüge Tettenborn’s (1814). At Paris he entered the diplomatic service of Prussia, and in 1814 acted under Hardenberg at the congress of Vienna. He also accompanied Hardenberg to Paris in 1815. He was resident minister for some time at Carlsruhe, but was recalled in 1819, after which he lived chiefly at Berlin as a privy councillor of legation (Geheimer Legationsrath). He had no fixed official appointment, but was often employed in important political business.

In 1814 he married Rahel Antonie Friederike, originally called Levin, afterwards Robert. She was born in 1771 at Berlin, where she died in 1833. By birth she was a Jewess; but before her marriage she made profession of Christianity. Although she never wrote anything for publication, she was a woman of remarkable intellectual qualities, and exercised a powerful influence on many men of high ability. Her husband, who was devotedly attached to her, found in her sympathy and encouragement one of the chief sources of his inspiration as a writer. After her death he published a selection from her papers, and afterwards much of her correspondence was printed. Varnhagen von Ense never fully recovered from the shock caused by her death. He himself died suddenly in Berlin on 10th October 1858.

He made some reputation as an imaginative and critical writer, but he is famous chiefly as a biographer. He possessed a remarkable power of grouping facts so as to bring out their essential significance, and his style is distinguished for its strength, grace, and purity. Among his principal works are Goethe in den Zeugnissen der Mitlebenden (1824); Biographische Denkmale (five vols., 1824-30); and “Lives” of General von Seydlitz (1834), Sophia Charlotte, queen of Prussia (1837), Field-Marshal Schwerin (1841), Field-Marshal Keith (1844), and General Bülow von Dennewitz (1853). His Denkwürdigkeiten und vermischte Schriften appeared in seven volumes in 1837-46. After his death were published two additional volumes of Denkwürdigkeiten, some volumes of his correspondence with eminent men, his Tagebücher (14 vols. ), Blätter aus der preussischen Geschichte (5 vols. ), and Biographische Porträts. His selected writings appeared in nineteen volumes in 1871-76.
