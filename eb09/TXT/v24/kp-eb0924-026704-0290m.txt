VIZIADRUG, or Gheria, a port in Ratnágiri district, Bombay presidency, India, about 30 miles south of Ratnágiri town and 170 miles south of Bombay city, in 16° 33' 40'' N. lat. and 73° 22' 10'' E. long. It is one of the best harbours on the western coast of India, being without any bar, and may be entered in all weathers; even to large ships it affords safe shelter during the southwest monsoon. The chief interest of the place centres in its fort, which is one of the strongest Mohammedan fortresses in the Concan, and rises grandly about 100 feet above the river.

About 1698 the pirate chief Angria made Viziadrug the capital of a territory stretching for about 150 miles along the coast, and from 30 to 60 miles inland. The fort surrendered to the English fleet in 1756, and was given over to the peshwá. In May 1818 an unsuccessful attempt was made to take Viziadrug, but, the whole of the district of Ratnagiri having now passed into the hands of the British, the fortress surrendered in June.
