VISCOUNT (Latin vice-comes), a titled rank of nobility, the fourth in the order of the British peerage, and consequently intervening between the dignities of earl and baron. The first English viscount, as that term now is used and understood, was John, Baron Beaumont, K.G., who, by letters patent dated 12th February 1440, by Henry VI. was created Viscount Beaumont. The title vice-comes, however, existed in England certainly as early as the Domesday survey; and in those early times it was borne by a county officer, who was deputy to the comes or earl, in accordance with the feudal system, which knew no titles independent of offices. The vice-comes, whose title from the first may fairly be translated “viscount,” and who acted in the absence of the earl, may be considered to have been identical with the functionary known by the English term “shire-reeve” or “sheriff,” or, as we now should say, “high-sheriff.” During the reigns of the Anglo-Norman monarchs this office of vice-comes was [9:24:262] commonly hereditary; after a while it was granted for several successive years to the same personage at the king’s pleasure; and, finally, the modern practice obtained of appointing a new high-sheriff every year. A viscount is “Right Honourable,” and is styled “My Lord.” His wife, also “Right Honourable,” is a “Viscountess,” and is styled “My Lady.” All their sons and daughters are “Honourable.” The coronet first granted by James I. has on the golden circlet a row of fourteen small pearls set in contact, of which number in representations nine are shown. The scarlet parliamentary robe of a viscount has two and a half doublings of ermine.
