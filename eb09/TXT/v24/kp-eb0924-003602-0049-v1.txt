VALENTINIAN I., emperor of the West from 364 to 375. He had been an officer of the guard under Julian and Jovian, and had risen high in the imperial service. With a fine robust frame, he possessed great courage and great military capacity. He was chosen emperor in his forty-third year by the officers of the army at Nicaea in Bithynia early in 364, and shortly afterwards named his brother Valens (q.υ.) colleague with him in the empire.

The two brothers, after passing through the chief cities of the neighbouring district, arranged the partition of the empire at Naissus (Nissa) in Upper Moesia. As emperor of the West, Valentinian took Italy, Illyricum, Spain, the Gauls, Britain, and Africa, leaving to Valens the eastern half of the Balkan Peninsula, Greece, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor as far as Persia. During the short reign of Valentinian there were wars in Africa, in Germany, and in Britain, and Rome came into collision with barbarian peoples of whom we now hear for the first time,—Burgundians, Saxons, Alemanni. The emperor’s chief work was guarding the frontiers and establishing military positions. Milan was at first his headquarters for settling the affairs of northern Italy; next year (365) he was at Paris, and then at Rheims, to direct the operations of his generals against the Alemanni. This people were driven back to the German bank of the Rhine, and checked for a while by a chain of military posts and fortresses, though at the close of 367 they swooped down on Moguntiacum (Mainz) and plundered the city. In that same year Valentinian was at Amiens, and there, before his assembled troops, he gave the title of Augustus to his son Gratian, eight years of age. The next three years he spent at Treves, organizing the defence of the Rhine frontier against the Alemanni and Saxons, and personally superintending the construction of numerous forts. Treves was, in fact, his headquarters during most of his reign. His general administration seems to have been thoroughly honest and able, in some respects beneficent. If he was hard and exacting in the matter of taxes, he spent them in the defence and improvement of his dominions, not in idle show or luxury. Though himself a plain and almost illiterate soldier, he was a founder of schools, and he also provided medical attendance for the poor of Rome, by appointing a physician for each of the fourteen districts of the city. He was a Christian, an orthodox Catholic, and in his life perfectly pure; but he permitted absolute religious freedom to all his subjects. Against all abuses, both civil and ecclesiastical, he steadily set his face, even against the increasing wealth and worldliness of the clergy. Valentinian was in many ways a good and able ruler at a particularly difficult time. The great blot on his memory is his cruelty, which at times was frightful, and showed itself in its full fierceness in the punishment of persons accused of witchcraft, soothsaying, or magical practices. In 374 the Quadi, a German tribe in what is now Moravia and Hungary, resenting the erection of Roman forts to the north of the Danube in what they considered to be their own territory, crossed the river and laid waste the province of Pannonia, Valentinian’s native land. The emperor in the April of the following year entered Illyricum with a powerful army, and gave audience to an embassy from the Quadi at Bregetio on the Danube, somewhere near Pressburg. Their defence threw him into a paroxysm of rage, in which he suddenly fell down, apparently in a fit of apoplexy, and died in a few hours. His two sons, Gratian and Valentinian II., were jointly his successors.
