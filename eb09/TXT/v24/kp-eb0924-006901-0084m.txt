VARASD (Germ. Warasdin), a royal free city of Hungary, in the county of Varasd, in Croatia, lies about 40 miles north-north-east of Zágráb (Agram), on the river Drave. It was once used as a stronghold, but now only the castle remains fortified. Varasd possesses several churches of interest, a fine new county hall, two gymnasia, and a real school. It has also tobacco and liqueur factories, and enjoys a brisk trade in wood and fruits, especially plums. The inhabitants numbered 13,701 in 1880.
