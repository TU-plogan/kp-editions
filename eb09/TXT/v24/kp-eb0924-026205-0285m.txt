VITEBSK, capital of the above government, stands on both banks of the DÃ¼na, on the railway from Smolensk to Riga, 345 miles west of Moscow. It is an old town, with decaying mansions of the old nobility, and dirty Jewish quarters, half of its 54,680 inhabitants being Jews. Its manufactures are insignificant, and the poorer classes support themselves by gardening, boat-building, and the flax trade, while the merchants carry on an active business with Riga in corn, flax, hemp, tobacco, sugar, and timber.

Vitebsk (Dbesk, Vitbesk, and Vitepesk) is mentioned for the first time in 1021, when it made part of the Polotsk principality. Eighty years later it became the chief town of a separate principality, and so continued until 1320, when, after having taken an active part in the internal wars of the Russian princes, it came under the dominion of the Lithuanians. In the 16th century it fell to Poland. Under the privileges given to the city by the Polish sovereigns it flourished, but it soon began to suffer from the wars between Russia and Poland, during which it was thrice taken by the Russians aud burned. Russia annexed it finally in 1772.
