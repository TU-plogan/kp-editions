VOSSIUS, Isaac (1618-1689), son of the preceding, was born at Leyden in 1618, and was carefully educated by his father. After three years spent on a learned tour through England, France, and Italy, which he used in making the acquaintance of the first scholars and the great libraries of those countries, and from which he brought back many valuable MSS., he accepted in 1648 an invitation to the court of the brilliant Queen Christina of Sweden, whom he taught Greek. He declined the offer of the chair of history at Amsterdam vacated by his father’s death, and continued for some years in Sweden, with occasional visits to Holland. In 1658 he finally left Sweden. His father’s merits and his own learning procured him favour with Louis XIV. of France and in England. In 1670 he came to reside in England, was made LL.D, of Oxford, and in spite of notorious looseness of morals and levity of character received a canonry at Windsor from Charles II. in 1673, residing in the castle, where he died in February 1689.

His learning was great, and he rendered valuable services in connexion with ancient history, antiquities, chronology, and geography, though they were marred by the admixture of great levity and want of judgment. To him is owing the first Greek text of the six shorter epistles of Ignatius (1646). He published valuable editions of the geographer Scylax (1639), of Justin (1640), of Pomponius Mela (1648), and of Catullus (1684). In his various dissertations on chronology he maintained the greater accuracy of the system of the Septuagint in comparison with that of the Hebrew text, and generally asserted the greater genuineness of the Greek translation as compared with the Massoretic text. He inherited his father’s valuable library, which, to the great sorrow of Evelyn, went after his death back to Holland.
