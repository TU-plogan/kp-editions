VOSGES, a mountain range of central Europe, stretching along the west side of the Rhine valley in a north-northeast direction, from Basel to Mainz, for a distance of 150 miles. Since 1871 the southern portion, from the Ballon d’Alsace to Mont Donon, has been the political boundary between France and Germany. There is a remarkable similarity between the Vosges and the corresponding range of the Black Forest on the other side of the Rhine: both lie within the same degrees of latitude and have the same geological formation; both are characterized by fine forests on their lower slopes, above which are open pasturages and rounded summits of a uniform altitude; both have a steep fall to the Rhine and a gradual descent on the other side. The Vosges in their southern portion are mainly of granite, with some porphyritic masses, and of a kind of red sandstone (occasionally 1640 feet in thickness) which on the western versant bears the name of “grès Vosgien.”

Orographically the range is divided from south to north into four sections :—the Grandes Vosges (62 miles), extending from Belfort to the valley of the Bruche; the Central Vosges (31 miles), between the Bruche and the Col de Saverne; the Lower Vosges (30 miles), between the Col de Saverne and the source of the Lauter; and the Hardt (25 miles). The rounded summits of the Grandes Vosges are called “ballons.” The departments of Vosges and Haute Saône are divided from Alsace and the territory of Belfort by the Ballon d’Alsace or St Maurice (4100 feet). Thence northwards the average height of the range is 3000 feet, the highest point of all, the Ballon de Guebwiller (Gebweiler) or Soultz, rising on the east to a height of 4680 feet. The Col de Saales, between the Grandes Vosges and the central section, is 1900 feet high; the latter is both lower and narrower than the Grandes Vosges, the Mont Donon and other chief heights not exceeding 3300 feet. The railway from Paris to Strasburg and the Rhine and Marne Canal traverse the Col de Saverne (1085 feet). No railway crosses the Vosges between Saverne and Belfort, but there are very good carriage roads over the passes of Bussang (2410 feet) from Remire-mont to Thann, the Schlucht (3746 feet) from Gérardmer to Munster, the Bon Homme (3100 feet) from St Dié to Colmar, and from St Dié to St Marie-aux-Mines (2625 feet). The Lower Vosges are a sandstone plateau ranging from 1000 to 1850 feet high, and are crossed by the railway from Hagenau to Sarreguemines, defended by the fort of Bitche. The Hardt, a sterile region, covered with heath and low brushwood, has for its highest point the Donnersberg (Mont Tonnerre), 2264 feet high; it is traversed through deep ravines by the railways from Deux-Ponts to Laudau, and from Kaiserslautern to Spires and Worms. Meteorologically, the difference between the eastern and western versants of the range is very marked, the annual rainfall being much higher and the mean temperature being much lower in the latter than in the former. On the eastern slope the vine ripens to a height of 1300 feet; on the other hand, its only rivers are the Ill and other shorter streams, which afford water-power rather by their rapid fall than by their abundance. The Moselle, Meurthe, and Sarre all rise on the Lorraine side. Moraines, boulders, and polished rocks testify the existence of the glaciers which formerly covered the Vosges. The lakes, surrounded by pines, beeches, and maples, the green meadows where hundreds of cows with tinkling bells peacefully graze, and the fine views of the Rhine valley, Black Forest, and snow-covered Swiss mountains combine to make the district charmingly picturesque. The lower heights and buttresses of the main chain on the Alsatian side are covered with numerous castles, generally in ruins, in connexion with which curious legends and interesting historical incidents are told. At several points on the main ridge, especially at St Odile above Ribeauvillé (Rappoltsweiler), are the remains of a wall of unmortared stone with tenons of wood, 6 to 7 feet thick and 4 to 5 feet high, called the pagan wall (Mur Payen). It was certainly used for local defence in the Middle Ages, and archaeologists are divided as to whether it was built for this purpose by the Romans, or before their arrival.
