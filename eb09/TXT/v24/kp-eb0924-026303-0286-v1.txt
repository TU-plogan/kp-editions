VITRÉ, a town of France, chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, stands on a hill rising from the left bank of the Vilaine, 24 miles east of Rennes by the railway to Paris. The town has preserved as many features of the Middle Ages as any in France, and viewed from the north its feudal aspect is striking. The streets are formed of confused masses of wooden houses, full of projections and curves, covered with coarse slate overgrown with moss and lichen, and are bordered by covered galleries on a level with the ground, out of which dark shops open. Most of the curious houses, ornamented with statuettes and sculptures, are older than the first half of the 17th century. Only one vault remains of the original castle, founded towards the end of the 11th century; the rest was rebuilt in the 14th and 15th centuries (the best period of Breton military architecture in Brittany), and all has been recently restored. It is now occupied by a prison, a museum of natural history and painting, and the town library (6000 volumes). In the court is the former collegiate church, some of it older than the 12th century. The church of Notre Dame, formerly a priory of the abbey of St Mélaine of Rennes, dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. An outside stone pulpit is a fine example of 16th-century sculpture. Parts of the ramparts are still standing, and other parts are built into the houses of the town. There is a well-wooded botanical garden, and the remains of a castle destroyed at the Revolution. The chief articles of trade are cloth, hosiery, and thick clothing made of goats’ skins. The chateau of Les Rochers, celebrated through Madame de Sévigné, stands 3 miles from the town. The population in 1886 was 8957 (commune 10,447).

Vitré was formerly a Breton barony, and belonged in the 10th century to the younger branch of the counts of Rennes. In 1295 it passed to Guy IX. baron of Laval, on his marriage with the heiress, and afterwards successively belonged to the families of Rieux, Coligny, and La Trémoille. The town was seized by Charles VIII. in 1488. Protestantism spread under the rule of the houses of Rieux and Coligny; Vitré became a Huguenot stronghold; and a Protestant church was established, which was not suppressed till the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. Mercoeur, the head of the members of the League in Brittany, besieged the town in vain for five months in 1589, and was forced to withdraw by the army under the Prince de Bombes. The estates of Brittany, over which the barons of Vitré and of Léon alternately presided, met here several times, and Madame de Sévigné gives interesting details of such an occasion. Vitré was the birthplace of Pierre Landais, the favourite minister of Francis II., duke of Brittany (hanged in 1485), of his nephew Cardinal Guibé, and of Bertrand d’Argentré, jurist and the historian of Brittany.
