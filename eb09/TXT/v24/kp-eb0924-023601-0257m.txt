VINCENT of Lerins, St, an ecclesiastical writer of the Western Church, of whose personal history hardly anything is known, except that he was a native of Gaul, possibly brother of St Loup, bishop of Troyes, that he became a monk and priest in the monastery of Lerinum (island of St Honorat opposite Cannes), and that he died in or about 450. From himself we further learn that only after long and sad experience of worldly turmoil did he betake himself to the haven of a religious life. In 434, three years after the council of Ephesus, he wrote the Commonitorium adversus profanas omnium haereticorum novitates, in which the famous threefold test of orthodoxy is laid down and applied,—“quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus creditum est.” It is not altogether improbable that Vincent of Lerins was also the author of the Semipelagian treatise against Augustinianism which is dealt with by Prosper of Aquitania in his Pro Augustini doctrina responsiones ad capitula objectionum Vincentianarum.

The Commonitorium has been edited by Baluze (Paris, 1663, 1669, and 1684), and by Klüpfel (Vienna, 1809). It also occurs in vol 1. of Migne’s Patrol. curs. compl. (1846).
