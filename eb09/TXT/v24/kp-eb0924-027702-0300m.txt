VOITURE, Vincent (1598-1648), the best writer of vers de société that France has yet produced, and one of the most influential preceptors of classical French prose, was born at Amiens in 1598. His father was a well-to-do wine merchant, who had connexions with the court, and it is one of the charges brought against Voiture that he was unnecessarily ashamed of his origin. At any rate he soon obtained a position in society, being appointed by Gaston d’Orléans to various offices in his household. Voiture had been well educated, and had profited both by his education and by the school friendships which it enabled him to make. He was early introduced to the Hôtel de Rambouillet, and travelled in the suite of Monsieur, or on missions, a good deal both in and out of France, on one occasion extending his journeyings as far as Ceuta, whence he wrote a letter of elaborate gallantry to Mademoiselle Paulet. Although a follower of Gaston, he made friends with Richelieu, and was one of the earliest Academicians. He also received appointments and pensions from Louis XIII. and Anne of Austria, and became altogether a very prosperous person. During his lifetime he, like most of the literary men of his time who were not cither dramatists or serious scholars, published nothing in book form, but his verses and his prose letters were the delight of the coteries, and were copied, handed about, and admired more perhaps than the work of any contemporary. This coterie success has, it would seem, done them more harm than good in the eyes of posterity. When the long and rather wearisome history of the quarrel between the Uranistes and the Jobelins (partisans of the respective merits of a sonnet of Voiture addressed to a certain Uranie and of another composed by his younger rival Benserade on the subject of Job) is mentioned, the modern reader is apt to suppose that the interest of the affair is merely one of antiquarian gossip. Yet it is difficult to think of any living writer who could surpass, or of any writer living during the last two centuries who could have surpassed, the mixture of gallantry and sincerity in the Uranie sonnet. Another famous piece of his of the same kind, “La Belle Matineuse,” is less exquisite, but still very admirable, and, generally speaking, Voiture deserves the praise given to him at the head of this article. His prose letters, if less interesting to the present generation, are full of lively wit, and are historically even more important. He ranks with Jean de Balzac as the chief director of the reform in French prose which accompanied that of Malherbe, and preceded that of Corneille, in French verse. Nor is there any one to whom more than to Voiture (who was for many years almost an arbiter elegantiarum in literary matters) the escape of French prose from the over-legislation which had such injurious effect on French verse can be ascribed. The fault of the century—a tendency to elaborate and “metaphysical” turns of phrase—affected him to a certain extent, but in a mild form; and, on the whole, he was the Frenchman of letters of the old school who has been least favourably treated by the resurrection of taste for that old school which the present century has seen. It may seem absurd, but is probably just, to ascribe this absence of enthusiasm in part to the fact that the most unjust censures of the extreme classical school passed harmless by him. Boileau had no abuse for him, and the 18th century read him with pleasure. The militant spirit of Romanticism had therefore nothing to avenge. Voiture lived a careless and Epicurean life for just fifty years, and died at the outbreak of the Fronde, which killed the society to which he was accustomed, on the 26th of May 1648. His works were first published two years later, and a characteristic and rather absurd literary quarrel, which made a great noise at the time, broke out, on the subject of his literary merits, between his friend Costar and a certain Sieur de Griac. The standard modern edition of Voiture is that of Ubicini, 2 vols., Paris, 1855.
