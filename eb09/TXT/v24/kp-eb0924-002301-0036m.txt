V

V is our twenty-second letter; it represents the voiced labio-dental to which F corresponds as the voiceless sound. It has been shown under U that these two symbols were originally one, and that their differentiation took place for convenience of writing only. But it was afterwards put to a good use, although not quite the natural one. It would have been better, while retaining u for the vowel, to have used v for the corresponding labial consonant, which is actually denoted by w. The difference of u and w is simply that of vowel and consonant: for u there is a sufficient opening of the lips to allow the voice to pass through without friction; but for w the aperture is so much closed, by bringing together either the inner edges of the lips (as in England) or the outer edges (as in some parts of Germany), that there is an audible amount of friction as the voice passes. The organs employed are the lips only in each case, whereas for v the upper teeth and the lower lip are the factors of the sound.

The symbol v does not occur in the oldest of our texts; it is represented by f , as in “heofon,” “ofer,” “hlaford” (lord). The f generally is voiced when medial, but voiceless when initial. This absence of two symbols for the corresponding pairs of fricative consonants has been noted already in the use of d (or þ) for both th and dh (see under T); s also did duty, as it often does still, for both s and z. In Middle English u appears commonly for v. The introduction of v into English writing is due to French scribes; as a matter of fact almost all the words which begin with v are of French origin.

It is tolerably certain that in Latin v represented the labial and not the labio-dental consonant. The arguments in favour of this view are singly not very important, but they are fairly numerous. The interchange of the u and v sounds, as in “genua” and “genva,” “solvo” and “soluo,” &c., is most easily explained on the hypothesis that υ = w, so are the loss of v, as in “audi(v)i,” “ama(ve)ram,” &c., and the retention of o after v in words like “cervos” (whereas in other combinations o sank to u), because “cer-woos” would have been a more inconvenient combination than “cervoos.” Again, the name of the letter should have been “ev,” not “ve,” like all other fricative sounds, “ef,” “el,” “es,” &c.; but in explosives “be,” “de,” “pe,” “te,” with the vowel following. There is no reason why this should not have been the case if v were really our v, a labio-dental; but if it was w the name “ew” was practically impossible, because the w would have been inaudible; therefore it went over to the other class of names. To these arguments may be added others drawn from transliteration. Mr A. J. Ellis (E. E. P., ii. p. 513) agrees that Latin υ cannot have been our labio-dental, but he thinks it probable that it was the South-German w, which differs from the North-German w (our v, labio-dental) in the manner described above, with some other points of difference. His chief ground is that it is hard to imagine w producing v except through an intermediate labial of the North-German kind. There is something in this argument. In any case the difference between these two w -sounds is slight compared with the difference between either of them and the labio-dental v. At what time the labial passed into the labio-dental of the Romance languages is uncertain. We can fix limits of time before which the change must have taken place: e.g., it must have been before the time when the Romanized Gauls, trying to pronounce the Teutonic w in “werra,” “ward,” &c., produced “guerra,” “guard,” &c. If their v had then had the w -sound there would have been no difficulty in producing the same sound in Teutonic words.

In the Roman system of numerals V stands for five. The reason is uncertain. The old view that it represents half ten (X), as D (500) represents half a thousand (M, originally Φ), has no very high degree of probability. It is perhaps as likely that I., II., III., IIII., denoted the uplifted fingers used in counting, and that V denoted the whole hand with the thumb on one side and the four fingers together on the other.
