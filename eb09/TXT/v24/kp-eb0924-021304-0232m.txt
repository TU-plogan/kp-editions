VICTOR IV. Two antipopes have claimed this name: â€”(1) Cardinal Gregorio Conti, who was chosen by a party in succession to the antipope Anacletus II. in 1138, but through the influence of Bernard of Clairvaux was induced two months afterwards to make his submission to Innocent IL; and (2) Cardinal Octavianus, the Ghibelline antipope, elected in 1159, and countenanced by the emperor Frederick Barbarossa. He died at Lucca on 20th April 1164.
