VILLEFRANCHE-SUR-SAÔNE, a commercial and manufacturing town of France, chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Rhone, is situated on the Morgon, near its junction with the Saône, 18 miles by rail nearly north of Lyons. The chief industrial establishments are factories of coarse woven goods, cotton, fustian, “molletons,” prints, and blankets, tan-yards, puddling-works, spinning-mills, distilleries, foundries, and a saw-mill. The wines of Beaujolais, hemp, cloth, linen, cottons, drapery goods, and cattle are the principal articles of trade. An old Renaissance house is used as the town-hall. The church of Notre Dame des Marais, begun at the end of the 14th and finished in the 16th century, has a tower and spire (rebuilt in 1862), standing to the right of the façade (15th century), in which are carved wooden doors. Villefranche is the seat of the primary normal school of the department. The population, 12,032 (commune 13,074) in 1881, was 12,157 (commune 12,518) in 1886.

The town grew up near a tower from which the lords of Beaujeu enforced their rights of toll on the Burgundy and Lyons road. The name arose out of privileges granted by Guichard I. of Beaujeu, which were confirmed and extended by his successors. Under the dukes of Burgundy Villefranche was the capital of Beaujolais, and retained some of its privileges when united to France. Baron des Adrets sacked the town and demolished the ramparts in 1562. A well-known academy was founded here in 1695.
