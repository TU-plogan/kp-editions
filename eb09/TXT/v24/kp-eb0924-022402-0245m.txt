VIGEVANO, a town of Italy, in the province of Pavia, on the right bank of the Ticino, 24 miles south-west from Milan and about the same distance north-west from Pavia. It is a mediaeval walled town, with an arcaded marketplace, a cathedral, and a castle of the Sforza family, dating from the 14th century and adorned with a loggia by Bramante. It is a place of some importance in the silk trade, and also produces excellent macaroni. The population in 1881 was 14,794 (commune, 20,096).
