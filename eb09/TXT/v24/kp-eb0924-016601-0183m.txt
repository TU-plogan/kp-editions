VERKHNE-URALSK, a district-town of Orenburg, Russia, at the eastern base of the Ural Mountains and on the upper Ural river, 380 miles north-east of Orenburg, is rapidly becoming an important centre of trade with the Bashkirs and Kirghiz in honey, wax, wool, hides, horses, and sheep. The population (10,354 in 1882) has doubled within the last twenty-five years.
