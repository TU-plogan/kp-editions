VLADIMIR, capital of the above government, is known in history as Vladimir-on-the-Klyasma, to distinguish it from Vladimir in Volhynia. It is picturesquely situated on the Klyasma and Lybed, 114 miles by rail to the east of Moscow. The Lybed divides it into two parts. Extensive cherry gardens occupy the surrounding slopes, each with its small watch-tower, having cords drawn in all directions to be shaken by the watcher when birds alight. The kreml stands on a hill and contains two very old cathedrals—the Uspenskiy (1150), where all princes of Vladimir have been buried, and the Dmitrievskiy, restored in 1834 in its old style. Several churches date from the 12th century. The “Golden Gate ”—a triumphal gate surmounted by a church—was built by Andrei Bogolubskiy in 1158. On the whole Vladimir is a decaying place; its population has only risen to 18,420 in 1884 from 13,865 in 1859. The manufactures are for the most part insignificant, and trade has not the importance it has in some of the district towns.

Vladimir was founded in the 12th century. It first comes into notice in 1151, when Andrei Bogolubskiy secretly left Vyshgorod —the domain of his father in the principality of Kieff—and migrated to the newly settled land of Suzdal, where he became (1157) grandprince of the principalities of Vladimir, Suzdal, and Rostoff. During the next century Vladimir became the chief town of the Russian settlements in the basin of the Oka, and till 1328 it disputed the superiority with the new principality of Moscow q.v. ). In the 14th century it began to fall to decay; and, like Pskoff, it is now one of the less important provincial cities of Russia.
