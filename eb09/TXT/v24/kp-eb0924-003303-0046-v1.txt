VALENCIA, a province of Spain, one of the three into which the former “kingdom” of Valencia is now divided, has an area of 4352 square miles and a population (1877) of 679,030, being thus, next to Barcelona, the most populous province in the kingdom. It is bounded on the N. by Teruel and Castellon de la Plana, on the E. by the Mediterranean, on the S. by Alicante, and on the W. by Albacete and Cuenca. The surface is very much diversified; along the coast it is for the most part low and level, the fertile “vegas” of Valencia, Játiva, and Gandia in many places rising very little above sea-level; to the west of these is a series of tablelands of a mean elevation of about 1000 feet, which in turn rise into the mountains that form the eastern boundary of the tableland of New Castile, and attain within the province a maximum elevation of nearly 4000 feet. The principal rivers are the Guadalaviar or Turia and the Jucar. The former enters the province in the extreme north-west, flows south-east, and falls into the sea below the town of Valencia; it receives numerous tributaries of little importance, and it dispenses fertility by numerous “acequias,” mostly of Moorish origin, throughout the whole of the lower part of its course. The Jucar is joined on the left at Cofrentes (“Confluentes”) by the Cabriel, a stream nearly as considerable as itself, and lower down by the Magro; its chief right-hand tributary is the Albayda. Both the Jucar and the Albayda, like the Turia, supply an extensive irrigation. Almost every kind of geological formation from the Silurian to the Quaternary is represented in Valencia: the vegas are Quaternary; nearly three-fourths of the entire province belong to the Cretaceous; large areas, especially to the west, in the district of Requena and Utiel, are of the Tertiary period; in the north the Jurassic is prominent; and Triassic is found along many of the river-valleys. The coast is skirted by considerable stretches of sand dune, and by a series of these the lagoon of Albufera (21,000 acres) is separated from the Mediterranean. The vegas enjoy an exceptionally fine, almost sub-tropical climate. In their low-lying portions rice is the favourite crop; elsewhere wheat, maize, and all kinds of fruit are abundantly grown; the mulberry is cultivated for silk; and wine and oil are produced. Esparto grass is grown in the less fertile areas. The tablelands produce according to their elevation and exposure figs, almonds, olives, and vines. The pastures of the higher grounds sustain numerous sheep and goats; but cattle and horses are relatively few in Valencia. The hillsides are somewhat bare of timber. The mineral resources of the province are little developed. The fishing industry on the coast is considerable. The manufactures include those of silk, glass, pottery, and leather; there are also iron foundries, distilleries, and soap manufactories. The coast railway from Tarragona to Encina passes through Valencia, whence another line has been carried along the Cuenca road as far as to Utiel (54½ miles). The province is divided into twenty-one partidos judiciales and has 275 ayuntamientos. There are six “cities”—Valencia (see below), Gandia (7604 inhabitants in 1877), Játiva (14,534), Requena (13,527), Sagunto (6287), and Alcira (16,146).
