VOIRON, a manufacturing town of France, in the department of Isère, stands on the banks of the Morge (a tributary of the Isère) and on the lower slopes of a mountain nearly 2500 feet high, 15 miles north-north-west of Grenoble on the Lyons railway. Some 30 or 35 factories, employing from 4000 to 5000 persons, are engaged in the production of a kind of cloth that takes its name from the town (toiles de Voiron), and the industry is carried on in the neighbourhood also, every inhabitant having his loom. Table linen, silk stuffs (2000 looms), and liqueurs are also made, and there are paper-mills, bleachworks, foundries, edge-tool factories, and building sheds. The monks of La Grande Chartreuse have stores at Voiron in connexion with the railway. A fine modern church was built from 1864 to 1873 in the style of the 13th century. The chief attraction of the town lies in the fine views it possesses of the mountains of Grenoble and the valley of the Isère. The population in 1886 was 8575.
