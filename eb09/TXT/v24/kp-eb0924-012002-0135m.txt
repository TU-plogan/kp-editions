VEDDAHS, or Weddahs, that is, “Hunters,” a primitive people of Ceylon, probably representing the Yakkos of Sanskrit writers, who appear to have been the true aborigines and the sole inhabitants of the island prior to the Hindu conquest. During the Dutch occupation (1644- 1796) they were met in scattered groups as far north as Jaffna, but are now confined to the south-eastern district, about the wooded Bintenne, Badulla, and Nilgala Hills, and thence to the coast near Batticaloa. They constitute three distinct social groups—the coast people, who are settled and partly civilized, freely intermingling with their Singhalese neighbours; the wild or rock people, who keep entirely aloof, living exclusively on the produce of the chase; and the village people, semi-nomad agriculturists, intermediate in every respect between the other two. The Veddahs are thus in a state of transition from the lowest to a relatively high degree of culture; and their physical appearance gives evidence of their intermediate position between the aboriginal and the intruding races of Ceylon. Virchow^[1. Ueber die Weddas von Ceylon und ihre Beziehungen zu den Nachbarstämmen, Berlin, 1882. ] finds (1) that the Veddahs and Singhalese have much in common, which is probably due to the intermingling of the aborigines with the Hindu immigrants, as is also suggested by historic and anthropological considerations; (2) that both differ very decidedly from the Tamils of north Ceylon and south India; (3) that the Veddahs show certain analogies with the small dark pre-Dravidian element in this region, which De Quatrefages calls “Negrito,” and which Huxley groups with his “Australoid” division of mankind. The true Veddahs of Bintenne are almost a dwarfish race, averaging about 5 feet (men, 5 feet 2 inches; women, 4 feet 10 inches), with correspondingly low cranial capacity, narrow high skull like the Papuan (index 70), mesognathous jaw, slightly prominent cheekbones, straight, but shaggy rather than lank, black hair, and features altogether more Hindu than Negroid, although of somewhat darker complexion than the ordinary olivebrown Singhalese. They wander about in small family groups, which have not reached the tribal state, being absolutely destitute of any political or communal organization whatsoever. Their dwellings are the caves of the rocks or the forest trees; they clothe themselves with foliage; and they devour uncooked vermin, reptiles, and whatever other quarry they are able to capture with their rude weapons. It is stated that they can neither count, mark the succession of time, nor distinguish colours; but what is more certain is that they never laugh, in this respect differing from nearly all other races. They also [9:24:121] appear to be the only savage people who speak an Aryan language, for their present speech at least seems to be a degraded form of Singhalese, consisting mainly of Sanskrit intermingled with Dravidian elements. This circumstance has given rise to the theory that the Veddahs are a degraded group of Hindu outcastes, whereas they call themselves the “sons of kings,” and claim to belong to a superior caste, a claim which, strange to say, appears to be admitted by their neighbours. Their religion has been described as a kind of demon-worship, consisting of rude dances and shouts raised to scare away the evil spirits, whom they confound with their ancestors. But these “demons” and " spirits” are purely anthropomorphic beings; of a supernatural order as understood by more cultured peoples they have no idea. Owing to an increasingly low birth-rate, the Veddahs are disappearing as a distinct ethnical group; even including the Rhodiyas of the western uplands they numbered only 2284 in 1886 (Ferguson’s Directory). But they should not be confounded with these Rhodiyas, who, although true outcastes, are nevertheless a much finer race, tall, well-proportioned, with regular features, and speak a language said to be radically distinct from all the Aryan and Dravidian dialects current in Ceylon. There is, however, in Travancore, on the mainland, a low-caste “Veda” tribe, nearly black, with wavy or frizzly hair, and now speaking a Malayâlim (Dravidian) dialect (Jagor), who probably approach nearer than the insular Veddahs to the aboriginal pre-Dravidian “Negrito” element of southern India and Malaysia.
