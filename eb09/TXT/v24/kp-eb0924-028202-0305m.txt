VOLO, a town and seaport of Greece, on the east coast of Thessaly, at the head of the gulf to which it gives its name. Volo lies just below the mouth of the little river Orchestus, near the west foot of Mount Pelion, on the southern verge of an undulating and extremely fertile plain, which stretches thence northwards beyond Larissa, and which is skirted on the east by the chain above which tower Pelion, Ossa, and Olympus. The town, which has a mixed population (1884) of 4000, comprises three distinct quarters :—the kastro, enclosed by walls and inhabited chiefly by Turks; the scala, or port, centre of the trade and shipping; and the squalid Graeco-Jewish suburb, which stretches from near the kastro to the coast. Volo, which is regularly visited by the Austrian, French, and Greek steamers plying weekly between the Piraeus and Constantinople, is the only outlet for the produce of northern Greece. The exports (tobacco, hides and skins, fruits, olive oil, raw silk and cocoons, &c.) were valued in 1886 at £31,000, while the imports (cereals, cotton goods, petroleum, sugar, hardware, &c.) amounted to £259,000.

The castle of Volo stands on or close to the site of Pagasae, whence the gulf took the name of Sinus Pagasaeus or Pagasicus, and which was one of the oldest places of which mention occurs in the legendary history of Greece. From this port the Argonautic expedition was said to have sailed, and it was already a flourishing place under the tyrant Jason, who from the neighbouring Pherae ruled over all Thessaly. Two miles farther south stand the ruins of Demetrias, founded (290 B.C.) by Demetrius Poliorcetes, and for some time a favourite residence of the Macedonian kings. On the opposite side of the little inlet at the head of the gulf rises the hill of Episcopi, on which stood the ancient city of Iolcus. Here Dr Lolling discovered in 1883 some underground sepulchral chambers resembling those of Mycenae and Orchomenus.
