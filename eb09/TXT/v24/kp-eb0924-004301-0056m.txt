VALLADOLID, capital of the above province, on the left bank of the Pisuerga, at its confluence with the Esgueva, which traverses the town by two channels, is situated (about 2250 feet above sea-level) 150 miles by rail to the north-west of Madrid. The site is in a small valley enclosed by steep and broken, though not very high, ground. The town, which was formerly surrounded by walls and entered by four principal gates, contains some fine streets and squares, especially the so-called Plaza Mayor, but on the whole it has a dull and deserted aspect, though of late years its industrial and commercial activity has somewhat revived. The granite cathedral, begun in 1585, would, if carried out according to the original design of Herrera, be a magnificent specimen of the Graeco-Roman style of that architect; only the nave, however, was ever completed, and the tower (one of four in the plan) fell in 1841. The interior is well proportioned, but bare. The tower and nave of the church of Sta Maria la Antigua date from about 1200. The church of San Pablo is later (1286); its chief feature of interest is a beautiful flamboyant portal, and formerly it had exquisite cloisters. Adjoining is San Gregorio (15th century) with a fine Plateresque façade. San Benito, dating from the end of the 14th century, is an elegant Gothic building with a lofty roof finely groined. The college of Santa Cruz, a Classical building founded in 1479, now houses a collection of pictures and sculptures of little value, except for some examples of Rubens and of the work of Berruguete. The university was founded in 1346; but the present Rococo building dates from the decadence of architecture in Spain. Among other public buildings of Valladolid may be mentioned the royal palace, built in the beginning of the 17th century, and the court-house and town-hall; several ex-convents are now used as barracks. Along the banks of the rivers are several public walks adorned with trees and fountains. The principal industries are the manufacture of linen, silk, and woollen fabrics, pottery, gold and silver work, leather, and paper. There is a considerable trade in the abundant agricultural produce of the vicinity. The population in 1877 was 52,206.

Valladolid is usually identified with the ancient Pintia of Ptolemy, described in the Itinerary as a town of the Vaccaei on the road from Asturica to Caesaraugusta. The present name is usually, but rather obscurely, explained as equivalent to Beled Walid, “the land of Walid.” The town was recovered from the Moors in the 10th century, but is first named in a public document by Sancho II. of Leon in 1072. The cortes of Castile frequently met here in the following centuries, and in the beginning of the 15th century John II. made it his principal residence. After the removal of the capital to Madrid by Philip II. in 1560 it began rapidly to decay. In December 1808 it was taken and sacked by the French, and in the January following Bonaparte resided here for some days, and caused the destruction of many fine buildings and works of art. Columbus died (1506) and Philip II. was born (1527) at Valladolid.
