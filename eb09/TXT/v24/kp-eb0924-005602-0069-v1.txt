VANCOUVER, George (c. 1758-1798), English navigator, was born about 1758. He entered the navy at the age of thirteen, and accompanied Cook in his second (1772-74) and third (1776-79) voyages of discovery. After serving for several years on the Jamaica station, Vancouver was appointed to command an expedition to the north-west coast of America, the object being to take over from the Spaniards their territory in that region, and to explore the coast from 30° N. lat. round to Cook’s Inlet (or river as it was then called), with a view to the discovery of an eastward passage to the great lakes in the British dominions. The special point which he had to [9:24:57] ascertain was whether the Strait of Juan de Fuca really was a strait. Vancouver, accompanied by Lieutenant Broughton, left Falmouth on 1st April 1791, and, after spending some weeks at the Cape, made for the coast of Australia, where a very careful survey of the south-west coast was made, especially of King George’s Sound, the value of which as a harbour Vancouver pointed out. He next made for Dusky Bay, New Zealand. After a short stay, he proceeded north-east, discovered the little island of Oparo (27° 36' S. lat. and 144° 12' W. long.) by the way, and on 30th December reached Tahiti, where he was again joined by Lieutenant Broughton, who meanwhile had discovered Chatham Island. After staying about three weeks at Tahiti and several weeks at the Sandwich Islands, Vancouver on 18th April 1792 sighted the west coast of North America (California, then known as New Albion) in 39° 27' N. lat. Here he proceeded to examine the coast up to 52° 18' N. lat. with minute care, surveying all inlets and navigating the passage through Juan de Fuca which separates the Island of Vancouver from the mainland. Most of February and March 1793 was spent again at the Sandwich Islands, with the natives of which Vancouver had much intercourse, and in the affairs of which he took much interest. In April he resumed his exploration of the coast, which he examined and surveyed as far north as 56° N. lat. Part of the autumn was spent in visiting the Spanish settlements in New California, and surveying the coast and coast region as far south as 35° N. lat. From January to the beginning of March Vancouver’s headquarters were again at the Sandwich Islands, the cession of which to Great Britain he accepted, though the cession seems never to have been officially ratified. Quitting the Sandwich Islands again about the middle of March 1784, Vancouver made direct for Cook’s Inlet by Tchernigoff Island and Kodiak Island. Cook’s Inlet was carefully explored and the fact established that it was not a river. The coast eastwards and southwards was surveyed as far as the limit of the former voyages. After spending some time about Nootka and visiting some parts of the coast, Vancouver set out homewards in the middle of October 1794. Several points were examined and surveyed on the west coast of America on the way southwards, including Cape St Lucas, the southern point of Lower California. After touching at Cocos Island and making a somewhat careful examination of the Galapagos Islands, Vancouver continued his voyage by way of Cape Horn, finally entering the mouth of the Shannon on 13th September 1795. He immediately set about the preparation of the narrative of his voyage, but died at Petersham in Surrey, 10th May 1798, before he had quite completed his task. Under the care of his brother the narrative was published in 1798 (3 vols. 4to), with a folio volume of magnificent maps and plates.

Vancouver’s work on the west and north-west coast of America was of the highest character, and has formed the basis of all subsequent surveys. His zeal led him to take an active share in all operations, and the hardships he thus suffered tended no doubt to shorten his life. He was a man of great tact, humanity, generosity, and uprightness of character.
