VIENNE, a department of France, formed in 1790 out of Poitou (four-fifths of its present area), Touraine (one-seventh), and Berry, lies between 46° 3' and 47° 10' N. lat. and 0° 6' W. and 1° 12' E. long., and is bounded by Deux-Sèvres on the W., Charente on the S., Haute-Vienne on the S.E., Indre on the E., Indre-et-Loire on the N.E. and N., and Maine-et-Loire on the N.W. The river Vienne, which gives its name to the department, with its tributaries the Creuse (subtributary the Gartempe) on the east and the Clain on the west, flows from south to north. The general slope of the department is in the same direction, the highest point (764 feet) being in the south-east and the lowest (115 feet) at the junction of the Vienne and the Creuse. In the south the Charente, on the northwest the Dive, and in the west some streams belonging to the basin of the Sèvre-Niortaise drain small portions of the department. The average temperature is 54° Fahr. The prevailing winds are from the south-west and west. The annual rainfall is 23 inches.

Of the total area of 1,722,478 acres arable land occupies 1,119,675, grass 76,899, vines 90,750, woods 193,322, and heath, pasture, and uncultivated land 146,971. In 1881 the live stock included 22,637 horses, 7176 mules, 9679 asses, 63,052 cattle, 155,212 sheep of native and 47,970 of improved breed, 66,655 pigs, and 21,744 goats. There were also 11,047 beehives (32½ tons of honey and as much of wax). The crops in 1884 were—wheat 4,557,146 bushels, meslin 245,641, rye 291,673, barley 1,063,647, oats 4,295,742, buckwheat 27,813, maize 51,529, potatoes 3,455,220, beetroot 54,941 tons, colza seed 668 tons, hemp 323 tons, flax 3½ tons, hay 108,955 tons, clover 54,862, lucerne 98,282, sainfoin 53,350, other fodder 10,079 tons, wine 20,288,952 gallons (average for last ten years 21,384,880 gallons). Oak, ash, alder, and birch are the principal forest trees, and among the fruit-trees are the chestnut, walnut, and almond. Iron and manganese occur, and there are numerous quarries of building and lithographic stones, lime, limestone, millstones, marl, and a sort of pebbles which are cut into “Châtellerault diamonds.” There are sulphur and iron mineral springs. The most important industrial establishments are the national arms manufactory and the cutlery works at Châtellerault; in other parts of the department are forges, blast furnaces, wool-spinning mills (580 spindles), hemp-spinning mills (4000 spindles, of which only 1500 are in use, and 28 looms), manufactories of serges and coarse cloth, vinegar, candles, leather, tiles, and pottery, paper-works, breweries, distilleries, rope-yards, lime-kilns, and numerous plaster and flour mills. Corn, wine, brandy, vegetables, fruit, chestnuts, fodder, cattle, cutlery, and dressed hides are exported; butcher’s meat, colonial produce, and coals are imported. The department has 233 miles of railway, 239 of national and 8704 of other roads, and 32 of waterway (the Vienne from Châtellerault, the Dive below Moncontour, and some miles of the Creuse being navigable). The population in 1881 was 340,295 and in 1886 342,785, an increase of 201,795 since 1801. Vienne forms part of the diocese of Poitiers, has its court of appeal and academy at Poitiers, and belongs to the Tours army corps district. The chef-lieu is Poitiers (population 34,628 in 1886), and the department is divided for purposes of administration into 5 arrondissements (Poitiers; Châtellerault, population of town 14,498 in 1886; Civray, 2464; Loudun, 4041; Montmorillon, 4155), 31 cantons, and 300 communes.
