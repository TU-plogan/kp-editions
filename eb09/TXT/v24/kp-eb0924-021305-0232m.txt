VICTOR, Claude Perrin (1764-1841), duke of Belluno, marshal of France, was born at La Marche (Vosges) on 7th December 1764. In 1781 he entered the army as a common soldier, and after ten years’ service he received his discharge and settled at Valence. Soon afterwards he joined the local volunteers and in less than a year had risen to the command of a battalion. He greatly distinguished himself on the Italian frontier, and for his bravery [9:24:214] at the siege of Toulon in 1793 he was raised to the rank of brigadier-general. He afterwards served for some time with the army of the eastern Pyrenees, and in the Italian campaign of 1795-97 he so acquitted himself at Mondovi, Roveredo, Porto Legnago, and many other places that he was promoted to be general of a division. After the peace of Campo Formio he for some time commanded the forces in the department of La Vendée; but in 1798 he was again in Italy and in the battle of Marengo especially took a very important part. In 1803 he became commander-inchief of the Batavian army, and after the peace of Amiens he acted for eighteen months as French plenipotentiary at Copenhagen. On the outbreak of hostilities with Prussia he joined the fifth army corps as chief of the general staff; at the battle of Friedland he commanded the first corps in such a manner that Napoleon made him marshal of the empire on the field. After the peace of Tilsit he became governor of Prussia, and in 1808 he was created duke of Belluno. In the same year he was sent to Spain, where he took a prominent part in military affairs, until his appointment in 1812 to command the ninth army corps destined to operate in Russia. Here his most important service was in protecting the retreating army at the crossing of the Berezina. He took an active part in the wars of 1813-14, till in February of the latter year he had the misfortune to arrive too late at Montereau-sur-Yonne. The result was a scene of violent recrimination and his deprivation by the emperor, who transferred his command to Gérard. Thus wounded in his amour propre, Victor now transferred his allegiance to the Bourbon dynasty, and in December 1814 received from Louis XVIII. the command of the second military division. In 1815 he accompanied the king to Ghent, and on the second restoration he was made a peer of France and major-general of the royal guard. In 1821 he was appointed war minister and held this office for two years. After the revolution of 1830 he retired altogether into private life. His death took place at Paris on 3d March 1841.
