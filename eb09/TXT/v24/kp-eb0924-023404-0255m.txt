VINCENT, or Vincentius, St, deacon and martyr, according to the Roman Breviary, was born of noble parents at Huesca (Osca) in Spain, and was educated by Valerius, bishop of Zaragoza, who in due time ordained him to the diaconate. Under the persecution of Diocletian he was arrested and taken to Valencia. Having stood firm in his profession before Dacianus, the governor, he was subjected to excruciating tortures and thrown into prison, where angels visited him, lighting up his dungeon with celestial light, relieving his pains, loosing his bonds, and mingling their voices with his in psalms of praise. His warders, having seen these wonders through the chinks of the wall, forthwith became Christians. He was afterwards brought out and laid upon a soft mattress that he might regain sufficient strength for new torments; but, while Dacianus was vainly meditating punishment, the saint gently breathed his last, as a crowd of bystanders kissed his feet and treasured up his blood in napkins. The tyrant exposed the body to wild beasts, but a raven miraculously descended and protected it; it was then thrown into the sea, but could not be hid, and finally received decent burial. The date assigned to his martyrdom is 304; he is commemorated on 22d January, chiefly in Spain and the patriarchate of Lisbon. Prudentius (403) devotes a hymn to the details of his martyrdom; Paulinus calls him the glory and ornament of Spain; and in more than one of his discourses St Augustine has celebrated his praise.
