VALENCE, a town of France, chef-lieu of the department of Drôme and an episcopal see, is situated on the left bank of the Rhone, 65 miles south of Lyons on the railway to Marseilles. The river is here crossed by a fine suspension bridge. The cathedral of St Apollinaris (originally of St Stephen) was rebuilt in the 11th century in the Auvergnesque variety of the Romanesque style, and consecrated in 1095 by Urban II. It was greatly injured in the Wars of Religion, but restored in 1604. The porch was rebuilt in 1861; above it rises a stone tower (187 feet). The church contains the monument of Pius VI. (bust by Canova), who died at Valence in 1799. A curious house (Les Têtes) of the 16th century has a sculptured front with heads of Homer, Hippocrates, Aristotle, Pythagoras, &c. The antique “little seminary” is occupied by a gallery of pictures, a museum of natural history, a library (25,000 volumes), and a collection of antiquities. Valence possesses a botanic garden, a champ de Mars, artillery barracks, and a departmental prison, worked on the solitary system. The chief industries are the spinning and weaving of silk, oil-pressing, distilling, metal-founding, and the manufacture of macaroni. A considerable trade is carried on in the product of this industry and in wine and agricultural produce. The population in 1881 was 21,941 (commune 25,402) and in 1886 22,453 (commune 24,761).

Valentia colonia Julia, Valentia Segalaunorum urbs, or civitas Valentinorum, was the capital of the Segalauni, and the seat of a celebrated school prior to the Roman conquest, a colony under Augustus, and an important town of Viennensis Prima under Valentinian. It was ravaged by the Alani and other barbarians, and fell successively under the power of the Burgundians, the Franks, the sovereigns of Arles, the emperors of Germany, the dukes of Valentinois, the counts of Toulouse, and its own bishops. The inhabitants rose unsuccessfully against these last in 1229, but obtained protection with the help of the dauphin in 1345. In 1450 they had their rights and privileges confirmed by Louis XI. and put on an equal footing with those of the rest of Dauphiné. In the 16th century Protestantism spread freely under Bishop Jean de Montluc, and Valence became the capital of the Protestants of the province in 1563. The town was fortified by Francis I. It had become the seat of a celebrated university in 1454; but the revocation of the Edict of Nantes struck a fatal blow at its industry, commerce, and population. Valence was the birthplace of General Championnet and of President Bonjean (shot by the Commune of Paris in 1871); the family of Montalivet had its origin here.
