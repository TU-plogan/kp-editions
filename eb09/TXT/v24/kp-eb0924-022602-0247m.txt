VILKOMIR, or Wilkomierz, a district-town of Russia, in the government of Kovno, 44 miles north-east of the capital of the province, is one of the oldest cities in that part of western Russia. Founded as early as 1025, it suffered much from the attacks of the Teutonic Knights, as well as from internal wars. It flourished in the 16th century under “Magdeburg law,” but soon came upon adverse times again during the wars between Poland, Russia, and Sweden. It was annexed to Russia in 1796. Its position on the principal highway from St Petersburg to Kovno gave it some trade in flax, but this is now declining. Its population increased from 7300 in 1860 to 16,240 in [9:24:227] 1885. Vilkomir has a fine church dating from the 14th century.
