VILNA, or Wilno, capital of the above government, is situated 436 miles to the south-west of St Petersburg, at the junction of the Vilia with the Vileika, and at the intersection of two great railway lines, one from St Petersburg to Warsaw, the other from Libau to the mouth of the Don. It is an old town, rich in historical associations. Its imperial palace, and the cathedral of St Stanislaus, containing the silver sarcophagus of St Casimir, are fine buildings. The (Greek) cathedral of the Holy Virgin contains the remains of Prince Olgerd (baptized in 1377) and his family. The museum of antiquities has valuable historical collections of the region. The ancient castle of the Jagellones is now a mass of ruins. The old university, founded in 1576, was restored by Alexander I., but has been closed since 1832 for political reasons; the only departments which remain in activity are the astronomical observatory and a medical academy. The scientific societies of Vilna, especially the medical and archaeological, are well known. In spite of the war of 1812, and the Polish risings of 1831 and 1863, the population has of late increased rapidly. In 1883 it numbered 93,760. The inhabitants are chiefly Roman Catholics in religion and Poles by nationality. The Jews are steadily increasing in numbers and now make more than one-third of the population. The town has an important trade in timber (with Prussia), as also in corn.

History.â€” The territory of Vilna has certainly been occupied by the Lithuanians since the 10th century, and probably much earlier; their chief fortified town, Vilna, is first mentioned in 1128. A temple to the god Perkunas stood on one of its hills till 1387, when it was destroyed by Jagello, after his baptism. After 1323, when Gedimin abandoned Troki, Vilna became the capital of Lithuania. The formerly independent principalities of Minsk and Lidy, as well as the territory of Disna, which belonged to the Polotsk principality, were annexed by the Lithuanian princes, and from that time Vilna, which was fortified by a stone wall, became the chief city of the Lithuanian empire. It was united with Poland when its prince Casimir was elected (1444) to the Polish throne. In 1519 it had a printing-office, and fifty years later the Jesuits founded there a college, which became later on a university. But the plague of 1588, a fire in 1610, and still more the wars between Russia and Poland, which began in the 17th century, checked its further growth. The Russians took Vilna in 1655, and in the following year it was ceded to Russia. The Swedes captured it in 1702 and in 1706. The Russians again took possession of it in 1788; and it was finally annexed to Russia in 1795, after the partition of Poland. Its Polish inhabitants took an active part in the risings of 1831 and 1863, for which they were severely punished by the Russian Government.
