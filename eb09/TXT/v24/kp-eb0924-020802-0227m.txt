VIATICUM. This word, which in classical Latinity means “provision for a journey” (Gr. τά έφoδια ), is often used by early Christian writers to denote the sacrament of the Eucharist, and sometimes even is applied to baptism. Ultimately it came to be employed in a restricted sense to denote the last communion given to the dying. The 13th canon of the council of Nice is to the effect that “none, even of the lapsed, shall be deprived of the last and most necessary viaticum (έφοδίου),” and that the bishop, on examination, is to give the oblation to all who desire to partake of the Eucharist on the point of death. The Same principle still rules the canon law, it being of course understood that penitential discipline, which in ordinary circumstances would have been due for their offence, is to be undergone by lapsed persons who have thus received the viaticum, in the event of recovery. In extreme cases it is lawful to administer the viaticum to persons not fasting. The ritual to be observed in its administration does not differ from that laid down in the office for the communion of the sick, except in the words of the formula, which is “accipe, carissime frater (carissima soror), viaticum corporis nostri Jesu Christi, quod te custodiat ab hoste maligno, protegat te, et perducat te ad vitam aeternam. Amen.”
