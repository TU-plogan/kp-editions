VALLADOLID, a town in the state of Yucatan, Mexico, lying towards the centre of the northern plateau, on the river Bolina, about 90 miles south-east of Merida, with which it is about to be connected by a railway. Valladolid, which with the suburban district has a population (1885) of 18,470, mostly Indians and half-castes, is situated in the healthiest and best cultivated part of Yucatan, and is accordingly much frequented by invalids. The town is well built, with regular streets, and low but substantial houses, generally fronted by a garden plot and shady trees. Amongst its buildings are seven fine churches, a large Jesuit college, a town-hall, a hospital, and a well-constructed aqueduct. But like everything else in Yucatan the place presents a general appearance of decay, although there is a considerable local cotton industry. Some miles to the east lie the remarkable ruins of Chichen-Itza, covering a space of nearly two miles in circumference. Amongst these remains are several sonatos, or tanks, from 65 to 200 feet in diameter and 50 to 110 feet deep, with steep rocky sides, in which water is still stored.

Valladolid is one of the oldest Spanish settlements in Yucatan, having been originally founded by Francesco de Montejo at a place called Chauachaa in 1543. But it was removed the next year to Zaqui, about 15 miles from the sea, with easy access to the port of El Cuyo, and soon after to its present position.
