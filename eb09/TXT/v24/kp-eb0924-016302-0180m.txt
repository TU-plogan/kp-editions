VERATRUM. The Greek physicians were acquainted with a poisonous herb which they called white hellebore, and which has been supposed to represent the existing Veratrum. Be this as it may, in modern times the name has been applied to a genus of herbaceous plants closely allied in their structure to Colchicum, but differing greatly in general appearance. Veratrum is a tall-growing herb, having a fibrous root-stock, an erect stem, with numerous broad, plicated leaves, placed alternately, and terminal much-branched clusters of greenish or purplish polygamous flowers. Each perfect flower consists of six regular segments, as many stamens, whose anthers open outwardly, and a three-celled superior ovary; this last ripens into a three-celled, many-seeded capsule. The genus is included in the order Melanthaceae, otherwise called Colchicaceae, and comprises a small number of species, natives of the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere, generally growing in pastures or woods. Some, and presumably all, contain a violently poisonous alkaloid called veratrin; but, given in small doses and under careful supervision, some of the preparations yielded by Veratrum are valuable medicinal agents, their effect being to lower the pulse and the heat of the body. Sabadilla seeds also furnish a drug once in more frequent use than at present. V. album and V. viride are commonly grown in gardens as ornamental perennials, but their poisonous qualities should be kept in mind, particularly as they bear a considerable resemblance in foliage to the harmless Gentiana lutea.
