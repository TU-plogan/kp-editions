VYSHNIY VOŁOTCHOK, a district town of Russia, in the government of Tver, 82 miles by rail to the north-west of that city, owes its importance to its situation in the centre of the Vyshne-Vołotsk navigation system, which connects the upper Volga with the Neva. The portage (vołok) of less than 17 miles between the Tvertsa, a tributary of the Volga, and the Tsna, which flows into the Msta and the Volkhoff (Lake Ladoga), had long been used for transporting boats from the one basin to the other, and the canal, which was afterwards dug, soon became one of the most important links of connexion between the Volga and the Neva; now, however, the boats prefer the Mariinsk system, and the prosperity of Vyshniy Vołotchok is declining. The inhabitants (11,590 in 1884) support themselves chiefly by shipping, and partly by the cotton industry. The trade is still considerable.
