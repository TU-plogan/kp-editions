VIOTTI, Giovanni Battista (1753-1824), violinist and musical composer, was born at Fontanetto in Piedmont, on 23d March 1753. He learned the rudiments of music from his father, a veterinary surgeon and an amateur horn-player; and in 1764 Giovannini taught him the violin for a year. Two years later he was placed by the Marchesa di Voghera under the violinist Pugnani at Turin. In 1780 Viotti, having already made himself a name, travelled through Germany and Poland to Russia, where the empress Catherine honoured him with marks of extraordinary favour. He next appeared in London, in company with Pugnani, and at once achieved a brilliant and lasting reputation. In 1782 he was equally successful in Paris. Two years later he was appointed leader of Prince de Soubise’s private orchestra; and in 1788 he undertook the direction of the opera, raising the performances, with Cherubini’s assistance, to a very high level. Viotti also joined with Feydeau-de-Brou in constructing the famous Feydeau theatre. In 1790 the Revolution compelled him to fly to England; but a charge of Revolutionary espionage drove him for a time to Hamburg, whence, however, he returned in 1795. From that time he resided almost uninterruptedly in London until 1818, when he once more settled in Paris, resumed the direction of the opera, and retired in 1822 with a pension. He died in London on 10th March 1824.

Viotti’s playing was distinguished by an extreme purity of style, a magnificent tone, and an endless variety of poetical and imaginative expression. He was undoubtedly the best violinist of the age, and the best composer for his instrument. Among his works are 29 violin concertos, a series of symphonies concertantes for two violins, 45 duos, 18 trios, and 21 quartetts, and a great number of sonatas, notturnos, and other instrumental works. His school was worthily perpetuated by his pupil Rode.
