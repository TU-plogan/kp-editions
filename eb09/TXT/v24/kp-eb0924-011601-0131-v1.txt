VAUGHAN, Thomas (1621-1665), “the Rosicrucian,” was the twin brother of Henry Vaughan (see above). When Thomas left Oxford he went into the church and became rector of his native parish Llansaintfraed until his ejectment, when he settled at Oxford as an alchemist. He died at Albury on 27th February 1665, poisoned by the fumes of a cauldron. Under the pseudonym of Eugenius Philalethes, Thomas Vaughan produced eleven volumes defending and describing the tenets of the Rosicrucians. The titles of these—among which are The Man-Mouse, 1650; The Second Wash, 1651; The Fame and Confession of the Fraternity of the Rosy Cross, 1652; Aula Lucis, 1652; and Euphrates, 1653—are not more extraordinary than their style. Henry More the Platonist engaged in controversy with Thomas Vaughan, deep calling unto deep in pamphlets.
