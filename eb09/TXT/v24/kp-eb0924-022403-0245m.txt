VIGIL, in its ecclesiastical sense, means the day preceding a festival. In the liturgy of the Roman Catholic Church there are special offices for the vigils of the greater feasts, and the vigil is regarded as more or less of a fast day. In the early church there was a widespread practice of celebrating festivals, of martyrs especially, by actual vigils (vigiliae or pernoctationes, παvvυχίδες ) in the churches; but this led to such serious evils that the custom had to be discouraged, and now survives, if at all, only in rare, unauthorized, and considerably disguised forms. In some of the stricter religious orders the daily office is recited at various hours of the night as well as during the day; but, if these nocturnal services are spoken of as vigils, it is only in the popular meaning of that word.
