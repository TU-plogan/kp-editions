VALENCIA, a town in the United States of Venezuela, capital of the state of Carabobo, situated amidst savannas and tropical plantations, 1800 feet above sea-level, in the valley between the two chains of the Maritime Andes. It is about 3 or 4 miles distant from the Lagoon of Tacarigua or Lake of Valencia (about 45 miles in length and from 10 to 13 in width). The town is connected by cart-roads with Carácas and other places in the interior, as well as with its port, Puerto Cabello. A railway across the northern chain of the Maritime Andes, with a total length of 33½ miles, was nearly completed between Valencia and its seaport in the end of 1887. The town is well built, with straight streets cutting one another at right angles. The plaza or chief square, which is adorned with an early Spanish church, commands a magnificent view of the [9:24:35] Maritime Andes. There are several manufactories, among them a weaving factory and one for the making of machinery and agricultural implements. An iron aqueduct supplies the town with drinking water. Among the educational institutions are a college of science and a normal school. The climate is said to be healthy. The highest temperature is equal to 85° Fahr., the lowest 68°, the mean 76° ∙5. The population in 1883 was 36,145.
