VIZAGAPATAM, a municipal and seaport town, the administrative headquarters of the above district, with a population in 1881 of 30,291. It lies on a small bay, the south extremity of which is bounded by a promontory known as the Dolphin’s Nose, and its northern extremity by the suburb of Waltair. The town or fort, as it is called, is separated from the Dolphin’s Nose by a small river, which forms a bar where it enters the sea, but is passable for vessels of 300 tons during spring tides. Vizagapatam is the residence of a Roman Catholic vicar apostolic. It contains some good streets, has a handsome hall, library, and reading-room, an excellent hospital and dispensary, and maintains a great many schools. The principal exports are grain and sugar, and the principal industries of the town are elk horn and ivory knick-knacks and gold and silver filigree work.
