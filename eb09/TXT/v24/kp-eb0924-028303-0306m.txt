VOLSK, or Voljsk, a district town of Russia, in the government of Saratoff, and 90 miles to the north-east of that town, on the right bank of the Volga, was a century ago but a small village (Małykovo); recently, however it has grown to be one of the important towns on the lower Volga, and its population has rapidly increased from 23,500 in 1860 to 36,315 in 1885. It is built in a narrow valley between chalk cliffs, and has a large cathedral and a market; it is surrounded by gardens, the produce of which is exported to Nijni-Novgorod— gardening being also a distinctive feature of the wealthy and populous neighbouring villages.
