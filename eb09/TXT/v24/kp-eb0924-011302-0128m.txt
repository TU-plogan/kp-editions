VAUBAN, Sebastien Le Prestre de (1633-1707), marshal of France, was born in the neighbourhood of Saulieu in Burgundy (now in the department of Côte-d’Or) on 15th May 1633. At an early age he was left an orphan in very poor circumstances, and his boyhood and youth were spent among the peasantry of his native place, thus enabling him to gain that sympathetic insight into the condition of the agricultural classes which he afterwards showed in his economic writings. He owed his early education and his first instruction in the rudiments of mathematics and surveying to a friendly curé, who had taken an interest in him and discerned his abilities. At the age of seventeen he joined the Spanish troops under the prince of Condé, but after about a year’s campaigning was taken prisoner by the French. He then became known to Mazarin, who treated him with kindness and enlisted him in the service of the king. In 1653 he first earned repute as an engineer by the share he had in the capture of Sainte-Menehould, and after further distinction at Stenay and Clermont he was given a lieutenancy and received in 1655 his commission as an “ingénieur du roi.” Between that year and the peace of 1659 he took part in numerous successful sieges—especially those of Gravelines, Ypres, and Oudenarde. After the cession of Dunkirk, Fort [9:24:114] Louis, and Mardyke in 1662 he had charge of the work of fortifying them as frontier towns. On the renewal of war in 1667 he saw much service in Flanders, and gained special distinction in the siege of Lille, of which town he ultimately became governor, the king making him a lieutenant in the guards and bestowing on him a pension. The originality and success of his methods were now fully recognized, and in 1669 he drew up, at the instance of Louvois, his first exposition of the theory of fortification (Mémoire pour Servir d' Instruction dans la Conduite des Siéges), which was afterwards published at Leyden (1740). In 1673 Vauban accompanied Louis XIV. on his Dutch campaign, and directed the more important sieges, afterwards superintending the demolition or reconstruction of the captured places. In the following year his principal achievement was the capture of Maestricht, and in 1677 he had the chief credit for the fall of Valenciennes and Cambrai. In the latter year he was appointed commissary-general of fortifications in succession to Clerville, and thus gained an opportunity, which in the following year he diligently used, for practically reconstructing the entire land-defences of France. In the short war of 1683-84 he gained further distinction by the fall of Luxembourg, and during the campaign of 1691-92 the names of Mons and Namur were added to the long list of his successes. In 1686 Vauban had the courage to make a representation to the king in favour of the republication of the Edict of Nantes; and about 1697 he wrote his almost equally bold Projet dune Dixme Royale, which, however, was not published until 1707 (see Political Economy, vol. xix. p. 359). In 1693 he was made a grand cross of the order of St Louis, and in 1703 marshal of France. The close of his life, which was saddened by the consciousness of waning influence and failing health, he devoted largely to the arrangement of the voluminous manuscripts {Mes Oisivetés') which contained his reflexions on such subjects as the art of war, administration and finance, agriculture, commerce, and the like. He died at Paris on 30th March 1707.

For Vauban’s work as a military engineer, see Fortification (vol. ix. pp. 441-446). The Oisivetés long remained unpublished, and of the twelve manuscript volumes containing them several seem to have been hopelessly lost; the fragmentary remains were published in three volumes at Paris in 1841-43. The Traité de l'Attaque des Places, written in 1703, and that De la Défense des Places, written a few months before his death, were published together in 1737. Among the subjects in which Vauban took a lively interest, and on which he wrote memoirs, may be mentioned the fortification of Paris, the inland navigation of France, its army organization, especially in the artillery service, and the limits of ecclesiastical power in temporal matters. The introduction of the socket-bayonet into the French army is usually ascribed to Vauban.
