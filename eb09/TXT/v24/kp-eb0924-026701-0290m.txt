VIVES, Juan Luis (or Ludovicus) (1492-1540), a well-known scholar of the third and fourth decades of the 16th century, was born at Valencia, in Spain, in March 1492. He studied at Paris and Louvain, ultimately becoming professor of humanity at the latter university. At the instance of his friend Erasmus he prepared an edition of Augustine’s De Civitate Dei, which was published in 1522 with a dedication to Henry VIII. of England. Soon afterwards he was invited to England and appointed tutor to the Princess Mary, for whose benefit he wrote De Ratione Studii Puerilis Epistolae, Duae. While in England he resided a good deal at Oxford, where he was made doctor of laws and lectured on philosophy. Having openly declared himself against the king’s divorce, he lost the royal favour and was thrown into prison, where he remained for six months. On his release he went to Spain and afterwards to the Low Countries, finally settling in Bruges, where he married and devoted himself to the composition of his numerous works, which were chiefly directed against the scholastic philosophy and the preponderant authority of Aristotle. He died on May 6, 1540.

A complete edition of his works was published at Basel in 1555 (2 vols, fol.), and another at Valencia in 1782.
