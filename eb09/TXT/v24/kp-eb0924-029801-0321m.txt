VORONEZH, capital of the above government, is situated on a high bank of the river of the same name, 365 miles by rail to the south of Moscow. It is almost entirely built of wood, and only recently began to reacquire importance as an entrepôt on the railway which connects Moscow with the Sea of Azoff. It has a military school of cadets, gymnasiums for boys and girls, and a number of schools for elementary education. Its theatre, now rebuilt, has a name in the history of the Russian stage, and the town was also the birthplace of two peasant poets, to whom we owe some of the finest examples of Russian poetry—Koltsoff and Nikitin. A memorial to the former has been erected on a public promenade. A few factories for cleansing wool and for the preparation of tallow and oil, as well as some distilleries, have arisen of late. The population of the town increased from 39,800 in 1860 to 56,185 in 1885. It is now an important entrepôt for corn, flax, tallow, hides, sugar, wood, and coal from the Don; the railway traffic amounts to 2½ million cwts., and that of the Razdelnaya junction, close by, is nearly thrice that amount.

Voronezh was founded in 1586, as a fort against Tartar raids, on a site which had been occupied from the 11th century by a Khazar town, but had been deserted during the 14th and 15th centuries. Four years afterwards it was burned by the Tartars, but again rebuilt, and soon became an important trading place. Its wooden fort was rebuilt in 1672. Peter I. recognized its importance, and in 1694 erected on an island of the river a wharf, where a flotilla of sixty-six boats (2546 guns and 17,000 men) was built, under the direction of Dutch shipbuilders, for the conquest of Azoff. It thus became the basis of further advances towards the Black Sea. The town was almost completely destroyed by fire in 1703, 1748, and 1773, but was always rebuilt and has steadily developed.
