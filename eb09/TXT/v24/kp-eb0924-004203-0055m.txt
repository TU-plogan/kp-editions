VALLADOLID, a province of Spain, one of the eight into which Old Castile is now divided, is bounded on the N. by Leon and Palencia, on the E. by Burgos, on the S. by Segovia, Avila, and Salamanca, and on the W. by Zamora. The area is 3043 square miles and the population in 1877 was 247,458. The province belongs entirely to the basin of the Douro, which traverses it from east to west, and within its limits receives the Pisuerga (with the Esgueva) on the right, and the Duraton, Adaja (with the Eresma), and Zapardiel on the left. The country watered by these rivers is for the most part flat and exceedingly fertile, the only part that can be called in any sense hilly being in the north-west, where the low Montes de Torozos [9:24:43] occur. For the excellence and abundance of its grain crops Valladolid shares with La Mancha the title of granary of the peninsula. Besides the ordinary cereals and pulses, the province produces hemp, flax, various fruits, red and white wine, oil, and madder. The Montes de Torozos are well clad with oak and other timber. The pastures are extensive and large numbers of horses, mules, and sheep, as well as some cattle, are reared, while honey, wax, and silk are also produced. The woollen fabrics of Valladolid were once highly esteemed, but this industry has now greatly declined. Some trade is carried on, facilitated by the Canal of Castile, which connects Valladolid, on the Pisuerga, with Alar del Rey, in Palencia, also on that river. The province is traversed by the national highways from Madrid to Santander, Leon, and Coruna, and the Calatayud and Salamanca roads may also be regarded as trunk lines. It is also traversed from north to south by the northern railway, which has a branch from Valladolid to Rioseco. There are 11 partidos judiciales and 237 ayuntamientos. The most important places besides Valladolid, the capital (see below), are Medina de Rioseco (4776 inhabitants in 1877) and Medina del Campo (5296).
