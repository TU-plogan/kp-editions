VOLNEY, Constantin François Chasseboeuf, Comte de (1757-1820), was born at Craon, on February 3, 1757, of a good but not noble family, and educated first at the neighbouring provincial towns of Ancenis and Angers, then at Paris. According to the common and curious habit of the time and country he was at first surnamed Boisgirais, but afterwards assumed the name of Volney. When he was about four aud twenty he acquired some reputation by an essay on the chronology of Herodotus, and was introduced into literary and philosophical society. He then did what was at the time not common, common as it has become since. Having inherited a sum of money, he visited the East and spent some four years in Egypt and Syria, writing the history of his travels when he returned, and publishing it in 1787. He had not merely travelled but had learnt Arabic, and had studied the politics as well as the topography of the countries he visited. Of the former study he gave evidence the year before the Revolution by some Considerations on the war between Russia and Turkey. He was a member both of the States-General and of the Constituante, and distinguished himself as an ardent reformer. In 1791 appeared the book Les Ruines, by which he is known to a great many people who have never read it. It is a kind of essay on the philosophy of history written from the philosophe point of view, and of course containing some direct and much oblique manifestation of philosophe antipathy to religion. It is probable, however, that those who, after the lapse of a century, read it under the impression of the strong denunciations of it by some orthodox writers of its own and immediately succeeding times will be not a little surprised. The book, of which the full title is Les Ruines, ou Méditation sur les Révolutions des Empires, purports to contain the discourses of a traveller among the ruins of Palmyra with a very 18th-century genius. Volney was a good deal more than a mere author. He tried to put his politico-economic theories into practice in Corsica, where in 1792 he bought an estate and made an attempt to cultivate colonial produce. He was thrown into prison during the Jacobin triumph, but escaped the guillotine. He was some time professor of history at the newly-founded École Normale, lectured there, and published his lectures. Then he undertook a journey to the United States, the result of which took form in a book (chiefly geographical) published in 1803. Next year he republished and much enlarged his early essay on Herodotus. He was not a partisan of Napoleon, but, being a moderate man, a savant, and a Liberal, was impressed into service by the emperor, who made him a count and put him into the senate, of which he was one of the least servile members. The restoration in the same way recruited him against his will, and he became a peer of France. He was a member of the Institute and latterly of the Academy proper, and, besides his historical, political, and (as the 18th century understood philosophy) philosophical studies, was a philologist of some power. He died at Paris on April 25, 1820, and his complete works appeared soon afterwards in 8 volumes.

Volney has been called the last of the philosophes, and so, if date and eminence together be considered, he was. It may, as in many such cases, be doubted whether his identification with a powerful but one-sided movement was more of service than of disservice to him. No doubt it stimulated his work, but it also cramped and distorted it,—the curious and not wholly intelligible attitude of the whole school towards Christianity showing itself distinctly in him as a prejudicing and narrowing force. He was, however, an accurate observer, a thinker of acuteness and originality if not of great width or depth, and master of his pen in no ordinary degree. His style suffers from the general defects of 18th-century French prose, in being thin, colourless, and devoid of flavour despite its clearness and brilliancy. But it serves him as a most excellent vehicle both of description and of argument.
