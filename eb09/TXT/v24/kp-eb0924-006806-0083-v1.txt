VAR, a department of France, formed in 1790 of part of Provence, but reduced in 1860 by the formation of the department of Alpes-Maritimes, so that the Var no longer flows through the department to which it gives its name. Situated between 42° 58' and 43° 55' N. lat. and 5° 39' and 6° 57' E. long., Var is bounded by the Mediterranean on the S., by Alpes-Maritimes on the E., by Basses-Alpes on the N., and by Bouches-du-Rhône on the W. In the N.W. it touches the department of Vaucluse. The river Verdon on the N. and the Siagne on the N.E. are natural boundaries. The surface of the department is one of the most broken in France; the highest point is in the northeast, where a peak of the Alps rises to 5620 feet and is surrounded by others ranging from 4500 to 5000 feet. These calcareous hills are much fissured and very dry on the higher plateaus, but are rich in springs, which occasion a very beautiful verdure in the valleys. Towards the west rises the St Baume (3700 to 3800 feet), which is connected on the south with the hills above Toulon (2300 feet). The Maures (2550 feet), which extend between the coast from Hyères to Fréjus, and the valley of the Argens form, geologically speaking, a sort of island in Provence, being composed of granite, gneiss, and schists. To the north of the Argens rises the independent Estérel Range (2020 feet), mostly composed of igneous rocks, with some schists and porphyry. The principal river is the Argens (71 miles), which drains the larger portion of the department, traversing it from west to east, and falling into the sea a little south of Fréjus. Its minimum volume is 72,000 cubic feet, even in the driest weather and when most lavishly drawn on for irrigation. Nominally it is navigable for 11 miles, but in point of fact it is used only for floating timber. Draguignan, the chef-lieu of Var, is [9:24:69] situated on the Nartuby, the principal tributary of the Argens. Other streams are, in the north the Verdon, a tributary of the Durance, in the west the Huvaune and Arc, in the south the Gapeau, and in the east the Siagne. The coast-line, which is one of the most beautiful and picturesquely varied in France, runs from west to east between the Gulf of La Ciotat and Cape Comarat, then from south-west to north-east between the Gulfs of St Tropez and La Napoule. The shore is dotted from west to east with the sand-covered remains of the Phocaean city of Tauroentum; the little ports of Bandol and St Nazaire; the peninsula of Cape Sicié, 1180 feet high, with its projection Cape Cépet (see Toulon) ; the roads of Toulon; the roads of Giens, the site of the Gallo-Roman town of Pomponiana; the peninsula of Giens, formerly an island attached to the mainland by two long spits of sand, between which lies the lagoon of Les Pesquiers with its “salines”; the great anchorage of Hyères, shut off from the Mediterranean on the south by the hilly and wooded islands of Porquerolles, Port-Cros, and Le Levant; the bold promontories of the Maures Mountains, dividing the coast into lovely bays; Cape Comarat (430 feet), with a lighthouse; the deep Gulf of St Tropez, with perhaps the best anchorage in all Provence; the Gulf of Fréjus, where owing to the accumulated alluvial deposits of the Argens the site of the Roman port of Forum Julii is now occupied by the inland town of St Raphael; the porphyry headlands of the Estérel Range, with the roads of Agay between them; and Cape Roux (1486 feet). The climate is remarkably fine and mild on the coast, where there is complete shelter from the north wind, but is more severe in the mountains. Hyères and St Raphael are favourite invalid resorts. The average temperature is 58° Fahr. at Toulon, 59° at Hyères. The annual rainfall is 19 inches at Toulon and 24 in the valley of the Argens.

Of the total area of 1,489,488 acres 379,021 are arable, 529,660 under wood, 185,333 under vineyards, 14,857 are meadows and orchards, 49,606 pasture, and 142,466 uncultivated. The live stock includes 8460 horses (many of Arab blood), 13,230 mules, 5420 asses, 3015 cattle, 105,840 sheep (wool-clip in 1879, 234 tons 4 cwts., valued at £10,000), 19,900 pigs, and 14,815 goats. There were 14,380 beehives (42 tons 10 cwts. of honey and 28 tons 7 cwts. of wax in 1879). In 1884 366 tons 15 cwts. of silk cocoons were produced. The crops in 1884 were 1,485,000 bushels of wheat, 13,200 of meslin, 11,000 of rye, 30,250 of barley, 7150 of maize, 2640 of millet, 125,400 of oats, 4,840,000 of potatoes, 2512 tons of beetroot, and 103,000 tons of different kinds of fodder. The vines, reduced by 60 per cent. since 1875 by the phylloxera, yielded in 1884 over 7,000,000 gallons of wine (average of previous 10 years over 29,000,000 gallons). In 1879 olives occupied 77,777 acres and yielded 1,384,856 bushels; four-fifths of the crop was pressed for oil and yielded 5256 tons. Mulberries, strawberries, pears, peaches, plums, figs, almonds, oranges, pomegranates, lemons, jujubes, guavas, and Japanese medlars are grown; and the laurel, palm tree, date tree, eucalyptus, cactus, and sugar cane flourish. An export trade is carried on in flowers, and also in truffles, capers, and onions. The forests are planted with white and evergreen oaks, cork trees, maritime pines, and chestnuts. In the dense, and almost virgin, forest of St Baume are beeches, maples, limes, oaks, elms, yews, and pines, and the flora of the district is botanically most interesting. Var possesses mines of iron, lead, aluminium, and coal (2846 tons of coal, 2075 tons of lignite in 1885). From 300 to 400 workmen are employed in the production of salt and chemicals. Hyères (population 13,170 in 1886) produces annually from 20,000 to 25,000 tons of salt. Marble, plaster, stone, chalk, clay, sandstone, and sand for glass are quarried or dug. There are 200 manufactories of pottery, earthenware, and tiles. Toulon (57,635), La Seyne (12,186), St Tropez (3622), and Bandol, where ships are built, are the chief industrial centres. There are silk, woollen (250 spindles, 6 looms), and cotton (350 spindles, 9 looms) mills, hat, cloth, and cork manufactories (1000 workmen), tan-yards, paper-mills (670 tons in 1879), printing establishments, tinned food manufactories, soap-works (172 tons), breweries, glass-works, oil-mills—in all 173 establishments. There are tunny, anchovy, and sardine fisheries. The department has 140 miles of railway, 164 of national roads, and 2448 of other roads. About half the population of 288,577 (1881) were agricultural, 46,691 manufacturing, and 30,228 marine. In 1886 the total population of the department numbered 283,689. Var is divided into 3 arrondissements (Draguignan, the chef-lieu, with 8562 inhabitants in 1886; Brignoles, with 4393 inhabitants; and Toulon (q.v.), 28 cantons, and 145 communes; it forms the diocese of Fréjus, and belongs to the jurisdiction of the Aix court of appeal and to the district of the Marseilles army corps.
