VITELLIUS, Aulus, the ninth of the twelve Caesars, and Roman emperor during the greater part of 69 a.d., was the son of Lucius Vitellius, who had been consul and governor of Syria under Tiberius, and distinguished for his gross and ridiculous flattery under Caius (Caligula) and Claudius, which the senate, who gave him a public funeral, recognized by a statue with the inscription “Pietatis immobilis erga principem.” He was one of the intimate companions of Tiberius at Capreae; he had driven chariots in the circus with Caius, had played dice with Claudius, had induced the young Nero to sing at a public entertainment, and had been a censor once and a consul three times. He had been governor of Africa, and had there, according to Suetonius (Vitellius, 5), acquitted himself creditably. Under Galba, to the general astonishment, he was chosen to command the army of Lower Germany, and here he made himself popular with his subalterns and with the soldiers by an outrageous prodigality and an excessive good nature, which soon proved quite fatal to order and discipline. Far from being an ambitious or scheming man, he was lazy and self-indulgent, fond of eating and drinking, and he was in fact drifted into empire by the promptings of Caecina and Valens, commanders of two legions on the Rhine. Through these two men a military revolution was speedily accomplished, and early in 69 Vitellius was proclaimed emperor at Cologne, or, to speak more accurately, emperor of the armies of Upper and Lower Germany. In fact, he was never acknowledged as emperor by the entire Roman world, though at Rome the senate accepted him and decreed to him the usual imperial honours. But after all he was only emperor in name. It was noted as a bad omen that he received the title of supreme pontiff on the anniversary of the day of Allia, 390 b.c., on which Rome was all but utterly overthrown by the Gauls. His advance into Italy at the head of a licentious and ruffianly soldiery was as horrible and calamitous as civil war could possibly be; there was fighting and bloodshed within 7 miles of Rome, and amid riot and massacre and gladiatorial shows and extravagant feasting and a waste of seven millions of money (Tacitus, Hist., ii. 95) the capital of the empire was a scene of horror and infamy such as had never been witnessed in the most savage revolutions of past days. As soon as it was known that the armies of the East, Dalmatia, and Illyricum had declared for Vespasian, Vitellius, finding himself deserted by many of his adherents, was for resigning the title of emperor; so crestfallen was he, so dull and lethargic, that, to quote Tacitus (Hist., iii. 63), “had not others remembered he had been an emperor, he would have forgotten it himself.” On the entrance into Rome of Vespasian’s troops he was dragged out of some miserable hiding-place, and, with his hands tied behind him, insulted unpitied, driven to the fatal Gemonian [9:24:263] stairs, and there struck down amid a shower of fierce eager blows. “Yet I was once your emperor,” were the last, and, as far as we know, the noblest words of Vitellius. He perished thus miserably in his 57 th year.

The Histories of Tacitus and the biography of Suetonius give us in full detail the story of Vitellius. In Merivale’s History of the Romans under the Empire (chaps. 56, 57) the period is fully and vividly described.
