VESTA (Greek Ғ εστία ), the goddess of fire and the domestic hearth. The cults of the Greek Hestia and the Latin Vesta, both of which involved the guardianship of an ever-burning sacred fire, are most probably derived from a very early custom, common to a great variety of races, and practised during many different ages. Among people in a primitive state of development the production of fire is a slow and very laborious process; thus it became the custom for each village to maintain a constant fire for the general use of the community, in order to avoid the troublesome necessity of obtaining a spark by friction in case of the accidental extinction at one time of all the village fires.^[1. Mr J. G. Frazer, in an interesting paper printed in the Journal of Philology (vol. xiv. pp. 145-172), on “the Worship of Vesta and its Connexion with the Greek Prytaneum,” has given many examples of a similar custom still surviving among various savage races. ] This fire, the central hearth or Ғ εστία of the village (focus publicus), became a sacred symbol of home and family life, and by degrees grew into a religious cult of great sanctity and importance. The form of the primitive house in which the fire was preserved, probably a round hut made of wattled osiers daubed with clay, appears to have survived both in the circular prytaneum of the Greeks and in the Aedes Vestae in Rome. To watch this fire would naturally be the duty of women, and especially of those who were not burdened with the cares of maternity, and hence may have arisen the Roman order of virgin priestesses, whose chief duty it was to tend the sacred fire. A survival of the prehistoric method of getting a spark appears to have existed in the rule which enacted that, if ever the sacred fire of Vesta did go out, the negligent vestal was to be punished by scourging (Livy, xxviii. 11), and the fire rekindled either by friction of dry sticks^[2. An allusion to the earliest method of obtaining fire by rubbing two sticks together is probably contained in the myth of Prometheus, who brought fire to mortals hidden in a hollow wand. ] or, in later times, by the sun’s rays brought to a focus by a concave mirror (Plut., Numa, 9). In the prytaneum, which existed in every Greek state, a different form of cult was developed, though the essential point, the sacred fire, was kept up, just as in the Latin worship of Vesta; and in both cases the fire was extinguished annually at the beginning of the new year, and solemnly rekindled by one of the primitive and hence sacred methods.^[3. Fire obtained in this way, that is “pure elemental fire,” was commonly thought to possess a special sanctity. Even throughout the Middle Ages in Catholic countries, at Easter, when the new year began, the old pagan rite still survived. On Holy Saturday all lamps in each church were extinguished, and the Paschal candlestick was lighted by the help of flint and steel. From this sacred source the other lights in the church were kindled, and the various households in the parish took a flame to relight their fires and lamps, all of which had been carefully extinguished beforehand. ] In Rome this was done on the first day of March, the Latin New Year’s Day (Ovid, Fast., iii. 137-145). Both among Greek and early Latin races, at the founding of a new colony fire was solemnly sent from the prytaneum or Vesta temple of the mother colony to kindle a similar sacred fire in the new settlement. Thus we find that, according to tradition, the worship of Vesta in Rome was introduced from Alba Longa (Liv., i. 20, and Ov., Fast., iii. 46), which appears to have been the oldest of the Latin colonies in Latium. This intimate connexion between the Greek prytaneum fire, sacred to Hestia, and that of Vesta in Rome has been ably worked out by Mr J. G. Frazer in the paper quoted above. The most generally received Latin legend attributes the founding of the Roman temple of Vesta to Numa, who transferred the centre of the cult from Alba, together with the four vestal virgins, its priestesses (Plut., Numa, 10). One of the later kings, either Tarquin I. or Servius Tullius, is said to have increased the number to six (Dion. Hal., iii. 67, and Plut., Numa, 10), and it is not till the last years of the pagan period that we hear of a seventh vestal having been added (see Ambrose, Epis., ed. Pareus, p. 477; also Plut., Rom. and Cam.).

The election (captio) of the vestal during the early period of Rome was in the hands of the king, and in those of the pontifex maximus under the republic and empire,^[4. From the time of Augustus the emperors themselves held the office of chief pontiff, and with it the privilege of electing the vestals. ] subject, however, to the following conditions (Aul. Gell., i. 12);—(1) the candidate was to be more than six and less than ten years of age; (2) she was to be patrima and matrima, i.e., having both parents alive; (3) free from physical or mental defects; (4) daughter of a freeborn resident in Italy. Certain details of the election were arranged subject to the provisions of the Lex Papia, now unknown. The selected child had her hair cut off, and was solemnly admitted by the pontifex maximus, who held her by the hand, and, addressing her by the name amata, pronounced an ancient formula of initiation, which is given by A. Gellius in his interesting chapter on the subject (i. 12). In early times there were certain rules by which girls could be excused from serving as vestals, but the honour soon became so eagerly sought that these provisions were practically useless. Vows were taken by the vestal for a limited period of thirty years, after which she was free to return to private life and even to marry— a thing very rarely done (Aul. Gell., vi. 7). This period of thirty years was divided into three decades: during the first the vestal learnt her duties; during the second she practised them; and during the third she instructed the young vestals. The special dignity of chief of the vestals, or virgo vestalis maxima, was reached in order of seniority. The inscriptions on the pedestals of statues of various vestales maximae show that a number of different grades of honour were passed through before reaching the maximatus or highest dignity.^[5. These inscriptions are printed in Middleton, Ancient Rome in 1885, pp. 200-6, and in Archaeologia, vol. xlix. pp. 414-422. ] The duties of the vestals, besides the chief one of tending the holy fire (Cic., De Leg., ii. 8), consisted in the daily bringing of water from the sacred spring of Egeria, near the Porta Capena, to be used for the ceremonial sweeping and sprinkling of the Aedes Vestae.^[6. The shrine of Vesta was not a templum in the strict Roman sense, as it was not consecrated by the augurs, its sanctity being far above the necessity of any such ceremony. Other natural springs might be used for the daily sprinkling, but it was forbidden to use water brought in a pipe or other artificial conduit (Tac., Hist., iv. 53; see also Guhl and Koner, Vit. Gr. et Rom., p. 654). ] They also offered sacrifices of salt cakes— muries and mola salsa— and poured on the altar of sacred fire libations of wine and oil, as is represented on the reverses of several first brasses and medallions of the empire (see fig. 1). The vestals were bound to offer daily prayers for the welfare of the Roman state, and more especially in times of danger or calamity (Cic., Pro Font., 21). They were also the guardians of the seven sacred objects on which the stability of the Roman power was supposed to depend:^[7. See Cancellieri, Le Sette Cose Fatali di Roma Antica, Rome, 1812. ] the chief of these was the Palladium, a rude archaic statue of Pallas, which was said to have been brought by Aeneas from the burning [9:24:194] Troy. This sacred object was never shown to profane eyes, but it is represented on the reverse of a coin struck by Antoninus Pius in honour of his deified wife Faustina

(see fig. 1). Strict observance of the vow of chastity was one of the chief obligations of the vestals, and its breach was horribly punished by burial alive at a place near the Porta Collina known as the Campus Sceleratus (see Livy, viii. 15 and 89; Plin., Ep., iv. 11; and Suet., Dom., 8). Cases of unchastity and its punishment were rare; and, as the evidence against the vestal was usually that of slaves, given under torture, it is probable that in many instances an innocent vestal suffered this cruel death. The case described by the younger Pliny (sup. cit.) is one of special pathos, as the vestal appears to have been condemned without any sufficient evidence, simply at the wish of the emperor Domitian. A fanciful reason for this fearful punishment is given by Ovid, Fast, vi. 459-460.

The privileges of the vestals and their influential position were very remarkable. They were exempt from any patria potestas, except that of the pontifex maximus, their religious father; they could dispose by will of their property, and were in most respects not subject to the Roman laws (“legibus non tenetur,” Servius, on Virg., Aen., xi. 204; cf. Gaius, i. 130, and Dion Cass., lvi. 10). This involved freedom from taxes, and the right to drive through the streets of Rome in carriages {plostrum and currus arcuatus). Some bronze plates have been found which were once attached to the carriages of vestals; the inscription on one of them runs thus, Flaviae Publiciae v.v. maximae inmunis in jugo (see C. I. L., vi. 2146-2148; cf. also Pruden., Contr. Symm., ii. 1088). They were preceded by a lictor when appearing on state occasions, and enjoyed other semi-royal honours (Plut., Numa, 10, and Dion Cass., xlvii. 19). At theatres and other places of amusement they enjoyed the best seats, except at some of the nude athletic contests, from which they were excluded; they also took an important part in all the grand religious and state ceremonies, such as when the pontifex maximus offered sacrifice on the occasion of a triumph before the temple of Capitoline Jupiter. They had power to pardon any criminal they met in the street on his way to execution, provided that the meeting were accidental. The vestals alone shared with the emperors the privilege of intramural burial (Serv., Ad Aen., xi. 206). During life they were richly dowered by the state (Suet., Aug., 31) and had public slaves appointed to serve them (see Tac., Hist., i. 43). They were also the guardians of the emperor’s will, and of other important documents of state (Suet., J. Caes., 83, and Aug., 101; Tac., Ann., i. 8; Plut., Anton., 58; and Appian, Civ., v . 73). Their influence in the appointment to many offices, both religious and secular, appears to have been very great. Many of the statues to the chief vestals which were found in the Atrium Vestae in 1883-84 have pedestals inscribed with a dedication recording that benefits had been conferred on the donor by the vestalis maxima. Lastly, they lived in a style of very great splendour: their house,^[8. For a description of this, and also of the temple of Vesta and its vicissitudes, see Rome, vol. xix. pp. 818-819; Middleton, Aneient Rome in 1885, pp. 181-206; and a paper by the same author in Archaeologia, vol. xlix. p. 391 sq. ] the Atrium

Vestae, which stood close by the Aedes Vestae, was very large and exceptionally magnificent both in decoration and material. The discovery already mentioned of a number of statues of vestales maximae has thrown new light on the dress of the vestals.^[9. These statues appear to have been the work of a privileged class of sculptors, who enjoyed the title of “fictores virginum vestalium,”— an honour which is recorded in some of the dedicatory inscriptions on the pedestals. ] With one or two exceptions the costume of these statues is much the same: they have a long sleeveless tunic or stola, girdled by the zona immediately below the breast. One only wears the diploidion over the upper part of her figure. The outer garment is an ample pallium, wrapped round the body in a great variety of folds, and in some cases brought over the head like a hood. All seem to have long hair, showing that the process of cutting off the hair at initiation was not repeated. One figure (see fig. 2) wears the suffibulum, a rectangular piece of white cloth bordered by a purple stripe, worn over the head and fastened on the breast by a fibula. ^[10. The form of the suffibulum as shown on this statue has a curious similarity to the amice worn by the mediaeval clergy. ]

According to Festus (ed. Müller, p. 348), this sacred garment was worn by the vestals only during the act of sacrificing (see also Varro, De Ling. Lat., vi. 21). This is probably the only existing statue on which this rare garment is represented. In all cases the head is closely bound by vittae, rope-like twists of woollen cloth, the ends of which usually fall in loops on each shoulder (see Servius, Ad Aen., X. 538).

The Regia, or official fanum of the pontifex maximus, was adjacent to the vestal’s house: —

“Hic locus est Vestae, qui Pallada servat et ignem;

Hic fuit antiqui Regia parva Numae."^[11. Ov., Tris., iii. 29. For the history of the Regia and its existing remains, see Rome, vol. xix. p. 819, and Archaeologia, vol. xlix. p. 398 sq. ]

When Augustus, after his election to the office of pontifex maximus in 12 B.c., moved his place of residence from the Regia to the Palatine, he built a new Aedes Vestae near his palace, in the magnificent Area Apollinis. This appears to have been a copy of the older temple of Vesta. No traces of it now exist; but Pirro Ligorio, in the latter part of the 16th century, made some sketches of what then existed of this second temple, to illustrate his great MS. on Roman antiquities, which is now preserved in the royal library at Turin (see Ovid, Fast., iv. 949-954, and Metam., XV. 864). The original course of the Sacra Via was supposed to have passed close to the temple of Vesta; but excavations made in 1886 have shown that this was not [9:24:195] the case, the supposed line of the road being really blocked by a very early structure. There is reason to believe that this formed part of the original Regia, which was rebuilt during the reign of Augustus in a more magnificent way by Domitius Calvinus, after his Spanish triumph.

The Vestalia, or chief festival in honour of Vesta, was held on 9th June (Ovid, Fast., vi. 249), after which the temple was closed for five days for a ceremonial cleansing.^[12. The solemn decade of the Vestalia began on 5th June and ended on the 15th, when the temple was closed. ] In private houses the feast was celebrated by a meal of fish, bread, and herbs, eaten, not on the usual triclinium, but by the domestic hearth, in front of the effigies of the Dii Penates (Ovid, Fast., vi. 309-310). The feast inaugurated by Augustus in honour of Vesta Palatina was held on 28th April, the anniversary of its consecration.

With regard to statues of the goddess, though the Greek Hestia was frequently represented in plastic art, yet among the Romans Vesta appears to have been rarely so treated. The Athenian prytaneum contained a statue of Hestia. But there was no effigy in the Roman temple of Vesta, although one is commonly shown on reverses of coins which have a representation of the temple, and it appears to have been commonly thought in Rome that a statue of Vesta did exist inside her shrine,—a mistake which Ovid corrects (Fast., vi. 297-300). No Roman statue now known can be certainly considered to represent Vesta, though a very beautiful standing figure of a female with veiled head (in the Torlonia collection) has, with some probability, had this name given to it.

The worship of Vesta appears to have died out slowly in the 4th century, after the adoption of Christianity as the state religion by Constantine. Zosimus (Hist. Nov., V. 38) tells an interesting story of a visit made to the Atrium Vestae at the end of the 4th century by Serena, the wife of the Vandal Stilicho, who took a valuable necklace from one of the statues, in spite of the remonstrances of an aged woman, the last survivor of the vestal virgins. Soon after that time the building appears to have fallen into decay, its valuable marble linings and other ornaments having been stripped from its walls.
