VOLUSENUS, Florentius (that is, Florence Wilson or Wolsey, though in an English letter he writes himself Voluzene), a Scottish humanist of the first half of the 16th century, whose elegant Latinity, but still more the thoughtful beauty of his Christian philosophy, claims for him a high place among the scholars of his age. That he was born near Elgin, and studied philosophy at Aberdeen, as is stated in the notice of his life published in 1619 by Thomas Wilson in Adamsoni Poemata Sacra, may be only an inference (though probably a just one) from a passage in the dialogue De Tranquillilate Animi, more than half of which consists of a description of the abode of tranquillity, based on a dream that, as we are told, came to the author, when he had been a student of philosophy for four years, after a conversation on the pleasant banks of the Lossie with John Ogilvy, afterwards rector of Cruden. Proceeding to Paris, he became tutor to a nephew (or really a bastard son) of Cardinal Wolsey, and this connexion led to repeated visits to England, where he was well seen by the king, and formed, with men like John Fisher, Stephen Gardiner, and Thomas Cromwell, connexions that were not dissolved by Wolsey’s fall, for he was in England as late as 1534. In Paris he knew George Buchanan, who afterwards wrote a graceful epitaph on his friend’s death, and found patrons in the cardinals Jean de Lorraine (to whom he dedicated in 1531 a Latin exposition of Psalm XV.) and Jean du Bellay. With the latter he started in 1534 for Italy, but, being detained by sore sickness at Avignon, found a new patron in the bishop of the diocese, the learned and pious Sadolet, who procured for him the mastership of the school at Carpentras, with a salary of seventy crowns. Volusenus felt himself a little out of place in a grammar school, all his tastes leaning to philosophy, and it would seem that from Carpentras he made repeated visits to Lyons (where Gesner saw him, still a young man, in 1540), probably also to Italy, where he made many friends, perhaps even to Spain, for Alciat tells us that he had acquired French, Italian, and Spanish “par frequentation des nations.” A letter of Sadolet from Rome in 1546 shows that he had then resolved to return to Scotland, and was concerned to know what course he should hold in the religious dissensions of the time. He died on the journey, however, at Vienne in Dauphiné.

The authorities for the life of Wilson are well brought together by Irving in the Lives of Scottish Writers (1839); with the exception of two letters in the Bannatyne Miscellany, vol. i., the most important of them had already been collected in Wishart’s edition of the De Tranquillitate (8vo, Edin., 1751). Irving, however, overlooked Wilson’s earliest works, Fl. Vol. ad illustr. Dom. Card. Lotharingorum Ρs. xv. Enarratio (4to, Paris, 1531) and Fl. Vol. Britanni in Psalmum nobis 50 Hebraeis vero 51 ad. .. Stephanum Winto-niensem Episcopum Enar. (4to, Paris, 1532). These show that his linguistic studies embraced Hebrew as well Greek and Latin. Wilson’s reputation, however, rests on the beautiful dialogue already cited, and first printed by Gryphius at Lyons in 1543. From internal evidence it appears to have been composed about that time, but the subject had exercised the writer for many years. The dialogue shows us Christian humanism at its best, not yet breaking with the church and somewhat afraid of authority, but open to new light, tolerant and yet believing. Volusenus is a great admirer of Erasmus, but censures in him a lack of purity in his Latin and a certain want of philosophy. Latinity and philosophical training are his own distinguishing points, but his philosophy is Christian and Biblical rather than classical or scholastic. To analyse his argument would here be out of place; the title of the dialogue itself shows that he takes a fresh and independent view of the chief good of Christian ethics, and it is sufficient to observe that from this point of view he ultimately reaches a doctrine as to the witness of the Spirit and the assurance of grace which breaks with the traditional Christianity of his time and contains ethical motives akin to, though not identical with, those of the German Reformation. The verses which occur in several parts of the dialogue, and the poem which concludes it, give Wilson a place among Scottish poets, but not nearly so high as that which he occupies among philosophical writers on Christianity.
