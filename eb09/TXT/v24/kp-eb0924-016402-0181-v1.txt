VERDUN, a town of France, chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Meuse, an episcopal see, and a first-class fortress, is situated on the Meuse, 174 miles east-north-east of Paris by the railway to Metz, at the junction of the line from Lérouville to Sedan by the Meuse. The enceinte is pierced by four gates; that to the north-east consists of two crenellated towers, and is an interesting specimen of the military architecture of the 15th century. On the left bank of the river is the citadel, on the site of the old abbey of St Vannes (10th century), the remaining buildings of which are used as barracks. On all sides the approaches to the place are guarded by an important line of defensive works, including five redoubts and six forts. From afar can be seen the square towers of the cathedral, the exterior of which still recalls the original building of the 11th century. It was burnt in 1047, and reconsecrated in 1147 by Pope Eugenius III. Some interesting buttresses of the 12th century and a crypt of the 11th are worthy of notice. The three naves of the interior have Gothic vaults, separated by modem arches. The town-hall (17th century) contains a library (22,500 volumes) and a museum of art, archaeology, and natural history. One of the public squares has a statue of General Chevert, a native of Verdun. The town is famous for its confectionery, sugar-plums, and liqueurs. In 1881 the population was 15,682 (commune 16,053), and in 1886 17,282 (commune 17,755).

Verdun (Verodunum), an important town at the time of the Roman conquest, was made a part of Belgica Prima. It was destroyed during the period of the barbarian invasions, and did not recover till towards the end of the 5th century. Clovis seized the town in 502, and it afterwards belonged to the kingdom of Austrasia. In 843 the famous treaty was signed here by the sons of Louis the Pious (see France, vol. ix. p. 534, and Germany, vol. x. p. 480). In the 10th century Verdun was definitively conquered by Germany and put under the temporal authority of its bishops. In the 11th century the burghers of the now free and imperial town began a struggle with their bishops, which ended in their obtaining certain rights in the 12th century. In 1553 Henry II. of France took possession of Verdun, which finally became French by the treaty of Westphalia. In 1792, after some hours of bombardment, the citizens opened their gates to the Prussians,—a weakness which the Revolutionary Government punished by the execution of some young girls who had offered flowers to the king of Prussia. In 1870 the Prussians, unable to seize the town by a coup de main, invested and bombarded it three different times, till it capitulated in the beginning of November.
