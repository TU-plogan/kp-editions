VIENNE, Haute-, a department of France, formed in 1790 out of Limousin (three-fifths), La Marche (one-fourth), Poitou, and Berry, and formerly known as Haut-Limousin, lies between 45° 26' and 46° 23' N. lat. and 0° 38' and 1° 54' E. long., and is bounded by the Indre on the N., Creuse on the E., Corrèze on the S.E., Dordogne on the S.W., Charente on the W., and Vienne on the N.W. Haute-Vienne belongs to the central plateau of France, and drains partly to the Loire and partly to the Garonne. The highest point (2549 feet) is in the extreme south-east, and belongs to the treeless but well-watered plateau of Millevaches, formed of granite, gneiss, and mica. To the northwest of the Millevaches are the Ambazac (2300 feet) and Blond (1690 feet) Hills, both separating the valley of the Vienne from that of the Gartempe, a tributary of the Creuse. The Vienne traverses the department from east to west, passing Eymoutiers, St Léonard, Limoges, and St Junien, and receiving on the right the Maude and the Taurion. The Isle, which flows into the Dordogne, with its tributaries the Auvézère and the Dronne, and the Tardoire and the Bandiat, tributaries of the Charente, all rise in the south of the department. The altitude and inland position of Haute-Vienne, its geological character, and the northern exposure of its valleys make the winters long and severe; but the climate is milder in the west and north-west. The annual rainfall at Limoges is 36 inches.

Of the total area of 1,360,000 acres 439,215 are cultivated, 4263 are occupied by vineyards, 75,333 by chestnut trees, and 163,135 by dry underwood. The crops in 1884 were—wheat 1,242,271 bushels, meslin 34,298, rye 2,482,557, barley 13,300, oats 318,026, buckwheat 1,529,368, maize 65,579, potatoes 6,710,723, beetroot 189,000 tons, colza seed 1845 tons, hemp seed 1921, hemp 1200, linseed 93, flax 46, hay 387,192, clover 31,527, lucerne 3153, wine 111,430 gallons (average for preceding ten years 141,020 gallons). The live stock included 8371 horses of a shapely and powerful breed, 684 mules, 4975 asses, 146,131 cattle, 507,443 sheep of native and 43,593 of improved breed, 104,263 pigs, and 9642 goats. There were 36,601 beehives (104½ tons of honey and 34½ tons of wax). The department is on the whole unproductive. The chestnut is here characteristic, as the apple in Normandy, and with the potato and turnip it forms the chief food of the people. The brooks are fringed by fine meadows, and the hills are covered with heaths or forests of beech, hornbeam, oak, birch, and chestnut. The mineral wealth consists of iron, copper, tin, wolfram, antimony, serpentine, fine-grained granite, gneiss, garnets, emeralds, and a kind of porphyry, which takes a fine polish. There are inexhaustible supplies of china clay, in which an export trade is carried on with Russia and America. 5800 workmen are employed in porcelain manufactories, 650 in paper and pasteboard mills (annual product, £100,000), 560 in wool and cotton spinning mills and manufactories of flannel, druggets, woollen cloaks, and carpets, 600 in shoe-making (annual product, £100,000), 600 in manufactories of sabots, 340 in glove manufactories, 370 in tan-yards, 325 in leather-dressing works, 130 in coach-building and wheelwrights’ shops, 125 in cabinet workshops, 325 in printing works, and 100 in distilleries (annual product, £480,000). In 1878 1153 tons of iron were produced, and there are forges, foundries, copper-works, and manufactories of agricultural and other implements. Porcelain, china clay, woven goods, boots and shoes, sabots, gloves, leather, cattle, horses, wood, chestnuts, hemp, and paper are exported; corn, wine, coal, raw materials, and various manufactured articles are imported. There are in Haute-Vienne 234 miles of railway, and 234 of national and 3191 of other roads. This department, with that of Corrèze, forms the diocese of Limoges; it belongs to the district of the Limoges court of appeal and army corps, has its academy at Poitiers, and is divided for purposes of administration into 4 arrondissements (Limoges, population of town 63,707 in 1886; Bellac, 4015; Rochechouart, 1829; and St Yrieix, 3556), 27 cantons, and 203 communes. The population in 1881 was 349,332 and in 1886 363,182, an increase of 117,982 since 1801. Limoges is the chef-lieu. St Yrieix has an early Gothic church of the 12th century, kaolin mines, porcelain manufactories, and tan-yards. St Junien (5454) has an interesting bridge and houses of the 13th century, and numerous manufactories of gloves, paper, porcelain, sabots, and woven goods. St Leonard (3427), the birthplace of Gay-Lussac, possesses a remarkable church of the 11th and 12th centuries, tanyards, paper-mills, and copper-works. At Châlus (1675) Richard Coeur de Lion died.
