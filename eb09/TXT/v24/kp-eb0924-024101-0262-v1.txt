VINET, Alexandre Rodolphe (1797-1847), a French critic, though not a Frenchman, was born near Lausanne on 17th June 1797. He was educated for and duly entered the ministry of the Protestant Church, the date of his ordination being 1819. He had, however, already acquired an important position as teacher of the French language and literature in the gymnasium at Basel, and during the whole of his life he was more of a critic than of a theologian, though he exercised some influence in the latter capacity, headed a secession from the national church in Vaud, was for a time professor of theology at Lausanne, and advocated an extreme toleration in the matter of religious formulas, together with the separation of church and state. As a theologian Vinet would already have been long forgotten, despite some sermons and treatises which had a certain vogue in his native country, and, being in part translated into English, exercised some influence on English-speaking adherents of Calvinism. His performances as a literary critic, which for the most part represent his academic lectures, are, however, of greater importance. By procuring for Sainte-Beuve an invitation to lecture at Lausanne on Port-Royal, he was the cause of one of the capital works of recent French literary history. But he had less indirect titles to fame in the same department than this. Like all other French writers of repute in Switzerland, he has been accused by French-born censors of that mysterious patavinity which is supposed to attach to Swiss French, and which has been illustrated in such a remarkable fashion by Rousseau, Benjamin Constant, Joseph and Xavier de Maistre, Töpffer, and others. But the persons thus branded were probably content to write French as well as Livy wrote Latin. Vinet’s Chrestomathie Française (1829), his Études sur la Littérature Française au XIX éme Siècle and his Histoire de la Littérature Française au XVIIP éme Siècle, together with his Études sur Pascal, Études sur les Moralistes des XVI éme et XVII éme Siècles, Histoire de la Prédication pendant les Réformes, and other books gave evidence of a wide knowledge of literature, a sober and acute literary judgment, and a very considerable faculty of appreciation. On the whole, he belongs to the academic school of critics rather than to the romanticimpressionist school, or to that rarer and better school than either which adjusts its theories to the work which is brought before it, and condemns nothing so long as it is good work according to the writer’s own standard. He had considerable affinities with this last, and his work, having the singular advantage of being in some sort foreign criticism, without undergoing the disadvantage which attaches in French eyes to all criticism of French affairs written in a foreign language, has had a great influence on France. Vinet died on 15th May 1847 at Clarens (Vaud). A considerable part of his works was not printed till after his death.
