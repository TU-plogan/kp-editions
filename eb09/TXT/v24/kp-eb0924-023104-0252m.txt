VILLENEUVE-SUR-LOT, a town of France, chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Lot-et-Garonne, is built on both sides of the river Lot, 22 miles north of Agen by a line which branches at Penne from the Agen and Périgueux Railway. Large portions of the 13th-century ramparts, altered and surmounted by machicolations in the 15th century, still remain, and high square towers rise above the gates to the north-east and southwest. The principal arch of the bridge (13th century) has a span of 118 feet and is 59 feet in height, and was built in the reign of Louis XIII. Arcades of the 13th century surround a square. Important markets of cattle, horses, wines, and Agen plums (£120,000 worth exported annually) are held. Boots and shoes, sausages, tinned foods, and buttons are made, and there are marble works and large mills. The population in 1881 was 9520 (commune 14,560) and in 1886 9780 (commune 14,693). Of these 1102 were prisoners at Eysses.

Villeneuve originated in a fortress built in 1264 as a refuge for the inhabitants of Pujols, whose town had been destroyed in the Albigensian War. The English held it from 1279 to 1337, and again in the 15th century. Less than a mile from Villeneuve the former abbey of Eysses, founded about the 7th century, stands on the site of the Roman town of Excisum. It is now used as a [9:24:232] central prison, and accommodates about 1200 prisoners. On the left bank of the Lot, 2 miles south of Villeneuve, are the 13th-century walls of Pujols.
