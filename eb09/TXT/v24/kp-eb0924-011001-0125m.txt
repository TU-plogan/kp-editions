VASILKOFF, a district town of Russia, in the government of Kieff, is situated 22 miles by rail to the south-west of that city. Its 16,600 inhabitants support themselves chiefly by agriculture and the transport of merchandise; there is also some manufacture of tobacco and soap.

Vasilkoff was founded in the 10th century, but laid waste during the Mongolian invasion. In 1320 it was taken by the Lithuanians, and later on by the Poles, under whom it remained until 1686, when it was annexed to Russia.
