VINNITSA, a district-town of Russia, in the government of Podolia, is situated on the Bug, 137 miles to the north-east of Kamenets-Podolsk, and 29 by rail from the Zhmerinka junction on the railway from Odessa to Lemberg. It was founded in the 14th century, but nothing now remains of its two stone forts. Its old Jesuit college is now a gymnasium. Owing to the great fertility of the neighbourhood, there are a number of distilleries; and the Vinnitsa merchants, mostly Jews, carry on trade in corn and spirits. The population in 1884 was 18,580.
