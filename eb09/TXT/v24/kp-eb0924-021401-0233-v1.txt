VICTOR, Sextus Aurelius. A person of this name was made prefect of Pannonia by Julian about 360 (Amm. Marc., xxi. 10), and may be identical with the man who was consul along with Valentinian in 373 and with the prefect of the city of the same name who is mentioned in an inscription of the time of Theodosius. Four small historical works have been ascribed to him on more or less doubtful grounds—(1) Origo Gentis Romani, (2) De Viribus Illustribus Romae, (3) De Caesaribus, (4) De Vita et Moribus Imperatorum Romanorum excerpta ex Libris Sex. Aur. Victoris. The four have generally been published together under the name Historia Romana, but the fourth piece is a rechauffe of the third; and, though all are late, there is no sufficient reason to think that they are by one hand. The second was first printed at Naples about 1472, in 4to, under the name of Pliny (the younger), and the fourth at Strasburg in 1505. The first edition of all four was that of A. Schottus (8vo, Antwerp, 1579). The De Caesaribus, which goes from Augustus to Constantius, and claims to be by a man of mean origin who rose to distinction through letters, may be the work of the Sextus Aurelius Victor known to history.
