VIDA, Marco Girolamo ( c . 1489-1566), one of the most eminent Latin poets and scholars of the age of Leo X., was born at Cremona shortly before the year 1490. He received the name of Marcantonio in baptism, but changed this to Marco Girolamo when he entered the order of the Canonici Regolari Lateranensi. During his early manhood he acquired considerable fame by the composition of two didactic poems in the Latin tongue, on the Game of Chess and on the Silkworm. This reputation induced him to seek the papal court in Rome, which was rapidly becoming the headquarters of polite learning, the place where students might expect advancement through their literary talents. Vida reached Rome in the last years of the pontificate of Julius II. Leo X., on succeeding to the papal chair (1513), treated him with marked favour, bestowed on him the priory of St Sylvester at Frascati, and bade him compose a heroic Latin poem on the life of Christ. Such was the origin of the Christiad, Vida’s most celebrated, if not his best, performance. It did not, however, see the light in Leo’s lifetime. Between the years 1520 and 1527 Vida produced the second of his masterpieces in Latin hexameters, a didactic poem on the Art of Poetry. Clement VII. raised him to the rank of apostolic protonotary, and in 1532 conferred on him the bishopric of Alba. It is probable that he took up his residence in this town soon after the death of Clement; and here he spent the greater portion of his remaining years. Vida attended the council of Trent, where he enjoyed the society of Cardinals Cervini, Pole, and Del Monte, together with his friend the poet Flaminio. A record of their conversations may be studied in Vida’s Latin dialogue De Republica. Among his other writings should be mentioned three eloquent orations in defence of Cremona against Pavia, composed upon the occasion of some dispute as to precedency between those two cities. Vida died at Alba on 27th September 1566.

Vida’s fame rests almost wholly on his Latin poems. These are more remarkable for their purity and grace of style than for qualities of imagination or powerful thinking. His contemporaries were of opinion that Vida approached more nearly to the ancients in majesty and gravity of diction than his rivals. Indeed, the Ρoetica can still be read with both pleasure and instruction. Though we miss the poetic glow of Poliziano’s and Pontano’s Latin compositions, and the exquisite workmanship of Flaminio’s lyrics, there is in Vida so facile a command of the Latin language and metre that we might fancy ourselves listening to a writer of the Augustan age. The following lines will give a fair notion of his powers
Dii Romae indigetes, Trojae tuque auctor, Apollo,
Unde genus nostrum coeli se tollit ad astra,
Hanc saltem auferri tandem prohibete Latinis:
Artibus emineat semper studiisque Minervae
Italia, et gentes doceat pulcherrima Roma;
Quandoquidem armorum penitus fortuna recessit,
Tanta Italos inter crevit discordia reges;
Ipsi nos inter saevos destringimus enses,
Nec patriam pudet externis aperire tyrannis.

This pious prayer was not granted in the age which followed the council of Trent.

Vida’s poems were collected and printed at Oxford in 1722, and an enlarged edition appeared in 1731. For an account of his works, see Symonds’s Renaissance in Italy, vol. ii.
