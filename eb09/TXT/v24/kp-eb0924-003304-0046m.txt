VALENCIA, capital of the above province, is situated in the beautiful “huerta” of Valencia, on the right bank of the Guadalaviar or Turia, 3 miles above its mouth, and 304 miles by rail east-south-east from Madrid. Until 1871 it was enclosed by a wall, built in 1356 by Pedro IV.; two [9:24:34] picturesque gateways with machicolated towers still remain. The river, reduced, except in time of flood, to a scanty stream by the demands made upon it for purposes of irrigation, is crossed by five bridges, of which the longest has thirteen arches. The streets are for the most part narrow, crooked, and somewhat gloomy, but in the more modern quarters there are some broad and handsome thoroughfares. The cathedral (La Seo), begun in 1262, was afterwards (1459) lengthened in its original Gothic style, but in such a way as to spoil its proportions, and in the 18th century it was further injured by Pseudo-Classic additions. It possesses some fine examples of the sculpture and metalwork of the 15th century, as well as of the Valencian school of painting. The campanile (El Miguelete), an isolated octagonal Gothic tower, 162 feet in height, commands an extensive view of the town and surrounding country. Near the cathedral is the episcopal palace; its large and valuable library, rich in medals and other antiquities, suffered greatly during the French occupation in 1812. Besides the cathedral, Valencia has fourteen parish churches and numerous other ecclesiastical buildings, none of them of great architectural beauty or interest; the church of St Nicholas (of Moorish origin) has, however, good specimens of Juanes as well as frescos by Dinis Vidal; and Ribalta can be studied in the chapel of the Colegio de Corpus or del Patriarcha. The university buildings, dating from the 16th century, are large but uninteresting; the library (about 42,000 volumes) suffered severely in 1812, and, like the other appointments of the university, falls considerably short of modern requirements. There is a collection of pictures (about 1000) in the city gallery, but only a few,—almost entirely of the local school,—are of any importance. Among other public buildings may be mentioned the court-house, a Doric edifice, dating from the time of Ferdinand the Catholic, and having curious frescos (1592) in its “chamber of deputies”; the custom-house (1758), now a cigar manufactory, employing some 3500 women; and the silk exchange, a large and elegant Gothic hall (1482). The citadel, on the northeast of the town, was built by Charles V. as a protection against Barbarossa, the sea-rover; in the south-west of the town is the former College of Saint Augustine, now used as a model prison, adjoining which is a large hospital. Outside the walls are a botanic garden, a large bull-ring, and various shady promenades, including the beautiful “Glorieta,” and, on the north side of the river, the alameda, leading to the port of El Grao. The principal manufacture is silk, and the town is also celebrated for its coloured tiles or “azulejos.” Linen and woollen fabrics, hats, leather, paper, cigars, glass, and pottery are also manufactured, and there are foundries and printing-works. Corn, rice, silk, saffron, oranges, raisins, almonds, figs, and other fruits are extensively exported, and iron, hardware, timber, and colonial produce are imported. The port is at El Grao (Villanueva del Grao; population 4433 in 1877), 3 miles distant, where a commodious harbour with a minimum depth of 20 feet has been constructed. The works were begun in 1792. The population of Valencia in 1877 was 143,856, and in 1888 about 170,000 (estimated).

The earliest historical mention of Valencia {Valentia) is by Livy (Epit., lv. ), according to whom Junius Brutus settled the soldiers of Viriathus here (136 B.C.). It sided with Sertorius (c . 77 B.C.), and was accordingly severely punished by Pompey, but must have recovered speedily, being mentioned by Pliny (iii. 4) as a colony in the region of the Edetani, and spoken of by Mela as an important place. It was taken from the Goths by the Moors in 714, and from the Moors by the Cid (see vol. V. p. 774) in 1094, from whom it is sometimes called Valencia del Cid. The Moors recovered possession in 1101, but were compelled finally to relinquish it in 1238, when Jayme I. of Aragon (“El Conquistador”) added it to his dominions. In the 16th and 17th centuries it became the seat of a considerable school of painting, of which Juanes (1506-79) may be regarded as the founder, and to which belonged also Francisco de Ribalta (1550-1628), Juan de Ribalta (1597-1628), José Ribera (1588-1656), Pedro Orrente (1560-1644), and J. G. Espinosa (1600-1680). In the beginning of the 17th century Valencia and its surrounding district suffered greatly from the expulsion of the Moors, its most industrious and enterprising cultivators. In the War of Succession Valencia sided emphatically with the house of Austria, for which it was punished by being deprived of many of its ancient privileges. In 1808 an abortive attempt to capture it was made by the French; they succeeded, however, in 1812, and held it till June 1813.
