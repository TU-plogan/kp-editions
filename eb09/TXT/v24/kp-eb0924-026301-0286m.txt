VITERBO, a city of Italy, capital of a circondario in the province of Rome, lies 1200 feet above sea-level, on the Arcione, at the north-western base of Monte Cimino (3450 feet), on the high road between Florence and Rome, 42 miles north-north-west of the latter city; a branch line (24¾ miles) connects it with the Attigliano station on the railway. It is picturesquely surrounded by luxuriant gardens, and enclosed by walls and towers, which date partly from the Lombard period. The streets are paved with large lava blocks, and the town has many handsome edifices, and some elegant fountains; among the latter may be mentioned the Fontana della Rocca by Vignola (1566). The cathedral, a fine basilica, with 13th-century restorations, contains the tombs of Popes Alexander IV., Clement IV., and John XXI. In 1271 it was the scene of the murder, on the steps of the high altar, during public worship, of Henry, son of Richard of Cornwall, by Guy de Montfort (see Dante, Inf., xii. 118). In the sacristy is a Madonna with saints by Lorenzo di Viterbo. The old episcopal palace is a Gothic building of the 13th century, in which numerous conclaves have been held. The church of St Rosa exhibits the embalmed body of that saint, a native of Viterbo, who died in her eighteenth year, after working various miracles and having distinguished herself by her invectives against Frederick II. (1251). St Francesco contains the tomb of Pope Adrian V., and has an important work by Sebastiano del Piombo; the Gothic cloisters of St Maria della Verità are strikingly beautiful. The town-hall contains some Etrurian sarcophagi and a few good paintings. The inhabitants of Viterbo (15,279 in 1881) are chiefly dependent on agriculture; hemp is a specialty of the district, and tobacco and various grains are largely grown, as well as the olive and vine. There are in the vicinity numerous mineral springs; the warm sulphur spring of Bulicame, about 2 miles off, is alluded to by Dante (Inf., xiv. 79).

Viterbo has sometimes, but very doubtfully, been identified with the Fanum Voltumnae, where the general assembly of the Etruscans used to be held. It was fortified by the Lombards, and in the Middle Ages became a favourite papal residence. Popes Urban IV. (1261 ), Gregory X. (1271), John XXI. (1276), Nicholas III. (1277), and Martin IV. (1281) were elected here, and it was at Viterbo that Alexander IV. (1261), Clement IV. (1268), Adrian V. (1276), and John XXI. (1277) died.
