VESZPRÉM, the chief town of a county of the same name in Hungary, lies between Lake Balaton and the forest of Bakony, about 65 miles south-west of Buda-Pesth. Veszprém is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, whose cathedral and palace, with the county hall and the gymnasium, form the chief features of the town. Veszprém is a station on the Western Railway system. Its four annual fairs are much frequented from all parts of the trans-Danubian district, and the trade in grain, wine, and home industries generally is considerable. The town is of very ancient origin, and was known to the Romans by the name of Cimbria. The queens of the Árpád dynasty used occasionally to reside here, and even now the queens of Hungary are crowned by the bishop of Veszprém. The place suffered much during the contentions between the Turks and the Hungarians and Austrians in the 16th and 17th centuries. The population numbered 14,800 in 1886.
