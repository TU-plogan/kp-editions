VINCENNES, a city of the United States, the county seat of Knox county, Indiana, is situated on the east bank of the Wabash, which is navigable to this point. It is the centre of a fertile agricultural district, with extensive underlying coal deposits, and is an important railroad centre, where seven railroads intersect. These railroads have their workshops here, in which they employ a large number of men. Besides this there are flour-mills, a woollen mill, furniture and cigar factories, and machine-shops. The population in 1880 was 7680, an increase since 1870 of 42 per cent. Vincennes is the seat of a university, chartered in 1804.

The site of the city was settled in 1702. In 1763 the British became its possessors, and it remained a British fort until captured by Colonel G. R. Clarke in 1779. From 1800 to 1813 it was the capital of Indiana Territory.
