VILNA, or Wilno, a Lithuanian government of west Russia, has the Polish province of Suwatki on the W., Kovno and Vitebsk on the N. and E., and Minsk and Grodno on the E. and S. Its area is 16,421 square miles. Vilna lies on the broad marshy swelling, dotted with lakes, which separates Poland (q.v.) from East Prussia and stretches east-north-east towards the Valdai Plateau. Its highest parts are a little more than 1000 feet above sea-level. On its western and eastern boundaries Vilna is deeply trenched by the valleys of the Niemen and the Dwina. Devonian limestones crop out in the northeast. Elsewhere they are concealed by the marine and freshwater limestones and sandstones of the Eocene period, which cover nearly the whole of Vilna; and these in their turn are overlain by thick layers of boulder clay, sands, and lacustrine deposits. The soil is for the most part clayey or sandy, fertile loam appearing only in the depression watered by the Vilia. Numerous lakes and marshes, partly covered with forests, and scarcely passable except when frozen, as well as wet meadow-land, occupy a large area in the central parts of Vilna. The Niemen, which flows along the southern and western borders for more than 200 miles, is the chief artery of trade for the government, and its importance in this respect is enhanced by its tributary the Vilia, which flows west for more than 200 miles through the central parts of Vilna, receiving many affluents on its course. Among the tributaries of the Niemen is the Berezina, which acquired renown during Napoleon’s retreat in 1812; it flows in a marshy valley in the south-east. The Dwina for 50 miles of its course separates Vilna from Vitebsk. The combined traffic on the Niemen and the Dwina was valued at nearly £200,000 in 1883. The climate of the government is only slightly tempered by its proximity to the Baltic Sea (January 21°∙8 Fahr.; July 64° ∙5); the average temperature at the town of Vilna is only 43° ∙5. But in winter the thermometer descends very low, the minimum observed during the last sixty years being - 30°. The flora and fauna are intermediate between those of Poland and middle Russia. The population of Vilna, which amounted to 1,223,260 in 1883, consists chiefly of Lithuanians (35 per cent.) in the west and north and White Russians (45 per cent.) in the south and east. Jews make up 11 per cent. of the population; and the Poles, who constitute the landed aristocracy and the artisan classes of the towns, reach 7 per cent. A few Great Russians and Tatars, descendants of Crimean prisoners, must be added to the above. Roman Catholicism is the prevailing creed among the Lithuanians and Poles; and the White Russians belong for the most part to the Greek and Nonconformist Churches.

In spite of the unfertile soil, sufficient cereals are grown for the needs of the population and to supply the distilleries. The average crops of 1882-1885 were 1,010,000 quarters of rye, 44,000 of wheat, 790,000 of various kinds of grain, and 9,840,000 bushels of potatoes. Apart from finer breeds kept by a few landowners, the cattle of the peasantry belong to inferior varieties. In 1883 there were 203,620 horses, 303,100 horned cattle, 277,800 sheep, and 238,800 pigs. More than one-third of the area is covered with forests, whence a considerable quantity of timber is exported, partly to Germany, for shipbuilding. A variety of petty trades are carried on in the villages of the forest region,—sledges, cars, wheels, and wooden ware being made by the peasants. Tar, [9:24:234] pitch, and potash are exported. The manufactures have only begun to develop of late. In 1884 there were 300 establishments employing 3020 men, and giving an annual output valued at £885,100 (as against £200,000 in 1860). An active trade in timber, corn, and flax (exported) and in manufactured goods (imported) is carried on. Vilna is divided into seven districts, the chief towns of which (with their populations in 1883) are—Vilna (see below), Vileika (3905), Disna (8030), Lidy or Lida (7940), Oshmiany (4470), Svienciany (8510), and Troki (2440).
