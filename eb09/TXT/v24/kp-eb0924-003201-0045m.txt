VALDEPEÃ‘AS, a town of Spain, in the province of Ciudad Real, on the railway line from Madrid to Cordova, is situated in the midst of a district thickly clothed with vineyards at the foot of the northern slope of the Sierra Morena. It is a straggling place and its only industry is that of wine-making (see Wine). The population within the municipal boundaries in 1877 was 13,876.
