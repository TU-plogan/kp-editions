VIZIANAGRAM, one of the most ancient and extensive estates or zamindaries in India, included in the Vizagapatam district of the Madras presidency, with an area of about 3000 square miles, and a population (1881) of 844,168. The chief town, Vizianagram, had in 1881 a population of 22,577.

The zamindari first came under the charge of the English authorities in 1817, with a very heavy debt, but it was restored to [9:24:268] the raja five years afterwards clear of all incumbrances. It again came under their charge in 1827, during a minority, but on the rajaâ€™s coming of age it was again restored with a surplus.
