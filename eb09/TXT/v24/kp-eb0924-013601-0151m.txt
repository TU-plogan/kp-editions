VELEIA, a town of Liguria, near the frontier of Gallia Cisalpina, on the Apennine slope, about 20 miles to the south of Placentia. The “oppidum Veleiatium” is vaguely mentioned by Pliny as belonging to Liguria, but its exact site remained unknown until 1760, when its remains began to be recovered from under a mass of debris, which showed that the city must have been overwhelmed by a landslip from the neighbouring mountain. Among the buildings that have been brought to light are a basilica, an amphitheatre, and several temples. Interesting antiquities from Veleia, including the “tabula alimentaria” of Trajan (see vol. xiii. p. 132), are deposited in the museum at Parma. None of the coins hitherto discovered on the site are later than the time of Probus (276-282).
