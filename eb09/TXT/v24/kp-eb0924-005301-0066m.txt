VAN, a city of Asiatic Turkey, capital of a vilayet, is situated two miles to the east of the lake to which it gives its name, in 38° 30' N. lat. and 43° 18' E. long. It lies on the ill-defined borderland between Armenia and Kurdistan, in an extremely fertile plain some 40 miles in circuit, which is described as one of the gardens of the East, whence the local saying: “Van in this world, heaven in the next.” Its low flat-roofed houses are grouped irregularly at the southern base of a nummulitic limestone eminence, somewhat resembling a camel’s back, which rises 100 feet sheer above the plain and is crowned by the so-called citadel, the fortifications of which are mostly in a dilapidated state. But it is naturally a position of great strength and of considerable strategic importance, standing at the junction of two military routes, which here diverge westwards through Mush and Kharpút to Asia Minor and southwards to Mosul and Mesopotamia, besides commanding the approaches to the Persian frontier at Kotúr and Bayezid. The town itself, which contains four mosques, two large churches, an Armenian bazaar, baths, and caravanserais, is enclosed within a double line of crenellated walls and ditches on the three sides not protected by the rock; and beyond these enclosures lies the suburban district of Baghlar, or the “Gardens.” The population, estimated at from 30,000 to 35,000, are Turks, except about 2000 Armenians and a few hundred Mohammedan and Nestorian Kurds. Besides trade and agriculture, the inhabitants are engaged in a few industries, such as the making of coarse cotton chintzes, a highly prized goat-hair waterproof moire antique, a thick woollen cloth called shayak, and an excellent soap, prepared from the saline efflorescences of Lakes Van and Erchek, which consist in about equal proportions of the carbonate and sulphate of soda.

Armenian tradition derives the name of Van from an Armenian king who reigned a little before Alexander the Great, and speaks of an older city founded by Semiramis (Shemiramagerd). This is of course fable; but the Vannic inscriptions (vol. xiii. p. 116) show that the region was the seat of an Armenian kingdom, whose native name was Biaina, as early as the 9th century b.c. In the isolated rock towering above the plain there are numerous galleries, flights of steps, crypts, and cuneiform rock inscriptions, one of which is trilingual, like that of Behistún, and like it relates the deeds of Xerxes, son of Darius. Others are in the Haikan or Old Armenian language; while for others scattered over the district a solution has been sought by Prof. Sayce with doubtful success in the present language of Georgia.

The vilayet of Van, one of the finest but also one of the least developed regions of Asiatic Turkey, lies on the Persian frontier between Erzerum (north) and Baghdad (south). It has an area of 15,000 square miles, with a population of over 1,000,000.

Lake Van.

Lake Van, called Arsissa Palus by the ancients, and also Thos-pitis, from its Armenian name Tosp, is 80 miles long and 30 broad, with a total area of 1500 square miles. Although of smaller extent than Lake Urmia, it contains a much larger volume of water owing to its much greater depth, which is at least 80 feet near Van and still more along the south side. The lake stands about 5400 feet above sea-level on the south Armenian plateau, which is encircled by the lofty ranges that bifurcate west and south from Ararat and culminate in the Sipan-Dagh (12,000 feet) on the north side of the lake. These mountains are clad with dense forests of beech, chestnut, ash, and walnut, while the broad fertile belt between their base and the lake is planted with melon gardens and orchards of plums, peaches, apricots, figs, and pomegranates, festooned with a vine which yields a palatable wine.

Lake Van, which is too brackish to be drinkable for man or beast, is inhabited by a species of blay or bleak, which abound especially about the mouths of the influents, and come to the surface when the spring floods spread over the heavier saline layers. This lake is a completely land-locked basin, or at least has no visible outlet. But the natives speak of underground channels through which it communicates south-westwards with the head-waters of the Tigris, attributing to the occasional obstruction of these channels the great oscillations of level that have undoubtedly occurred in past and recent times. In the 17th century and again about 1840 the water rose from 10 to 12 feet, and is even now (1888) rising. Lake Erchek perhaps marks its extreme eastern limit in former times. Lake Van is also indirectly connected with the Euphrates through the little Lake of Nazik, which lies west of the Sipan-Dagh, on the water-parting between the lacustrian and fluvial basins, and which by a rare phenomenon sends emissaries to both. The narrow part of Lake Van, which runs for nearly 40 miles towards the north-east, and gives the lake somewhat the appearance of a frying-pan, is very shallow, and was once, according to tradition, a fertile plain. The lake is not regularly navigated. Scattered along the south-east shore are a few picturesque islets, one of which, Aktamar, is the seat of an Armenian patriarch.
