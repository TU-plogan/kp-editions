VALERIUS, Publius, surnamed Publicola, the colleague of Brutus in the consulship in the first year of the Roman republic. According to the legend represented by Livy and Plutarch (see Rome), he was a member of one of the noblest Roman families, being son of Volusus, a descendant of a Sabine of that name who had settled in Rome along with King Tatius. He was one of those who witnessed the death of Lucretia, and joined in the oath to avenge her wrongs. He took a prominent part in the expulsion of the Tarquins, and though not originally chosen as the colleague of Brutus he soon afterwards took the place of Tarquinius Collatinus. On the death of Brutus, which left him alone in the consulship, the people began to fear that he was aiming at kingly power. To calm their apprehensions, he discontinued the building of a house which he had begun on the top of the Velian Hill, overlooking the Forum, and also gave orders that the fasces should henceforward be lowered whenever he appeared before the people. He introduced various laws further to protect the liberties of the citizens, one of these enacting that whosoever should attempt to make himself a king might be slain by any man at any time, and another providing an appeal to the people on behalf of any citizen condemned by a magistrate. For these services the surname of Publicola or Poplicola was conferred on himself and on his descendants for ever. He was thrice re-elected to the consulship, and during his fourth term of office he received the honour of a triumph for his victory over the Sabines. He died in the following year (503 B.C.), and was buried at the public expense, the matrons mourning him for ten months.
