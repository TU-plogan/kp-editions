STOCKPORT, a market-town and municipal and parliamentary borough of England, in Cheshire and partly in Lancashire, is situated on an elevation above the Mersey at the junction of the Tame and Goyt, and of a number of railway lines, 46 miles east-north-east of Chester, 37 east of Liverpool, and 6 south-south-east of Manchester. Owing to the lie of the ground the streets are very irre gular and uneven, and occasionally precipitous, while in the south they rise above the river in tiers. The Mersey is crossed by a number of bridges, including one of eleven arches opened in 1826 at a cost of £40,000. None of the ecclesiastical buildings are of special interest, the principal being the church of St Mary, erected in 1817, at a cost of £30,000, on the site of one of the 15th century, of which the chancel and vestry remain. The free grammar school was founded and endowed in 1487 by Sir Edward Shaa or Shaw, knight. The present building was erected in 1831 by the Goldsmiths’ Company, who further endowed it with £290 a year, and handed it over to the corporation. The Stockport Sunday school, erected in 1805, has accommodation for 4000 scholars. There is a free public library, established in 1875. The principal public buildings are the court-house, the market-house, the union workhouse, the mechanics’ institute, the infirmary, the institution for the blind and deaf and dumb, and the fine new public baths. In St Peter’s Square there is a statue, unveiled 27th November 1886, of Richard Cobden, who was elected member for the borough in 1841 and 1847. Vernon Park, finely situated about a mile from the town, contains a free museum, built in 1858 at the expense of the members for the borough, and since enlarged by the corporation. The staple industries are the spinning and weaving of cotton and felt-hat making. There are also breweries, foundries, machine-works, and flour-mills. The limits of the municipal and parliamentary boroughs are co extensive. The area is 2200 acres, with a population in 1871 of 53,014 and in 1881 of 59,553.

Though not referred to in any of the Roman itineraries, and possessing neither Roman nor Saxon remains, Stockport is supposed to have been a Roman camp or outpost, which occupied the hill on which the Normans afterwards built a baronial castle. It is not mentioned in Domesday. The castle was held in 1173 by Geoffrey de Costentyn against Henry II., but whether in his own right or not is uncertain. In the beginning of the 13th century it was possessed by the first Baron Ranulf de Dapifer, progenitor of the Despensers, from whom it passed to Robert de Stockeport, who in the reign of Henry III. made the town a free borough, and in 1260 received for it from the earl of Chester the grant of a market. The town was visited by the plague in 1605-6. It was of some importance during the Civil War, and was taken by the Royalists under Prince Rupert in May 1644. During the insurrection of 1745 Prince Charles Edward rested at the town on the 28th November. The town was enfranchised in 1832, with the right, which it still retains, of returning two members, and was incorporated under the Corporations Act in 1835.
