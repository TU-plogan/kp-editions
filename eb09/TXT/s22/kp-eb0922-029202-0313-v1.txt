SPAGNA, Lo (?–c. 1529), the usual designation (due to his Spanish origin) of Giovanni di Pietro, one of the chief followers of Perugino. Nothing whatever is known of his early life, or of the circumstances under which he became a member of the Perugian school. A large number of panel pictures by him exist, of which some are painted with much grace and refinement of touch. There is, however, a very marked absence of individuality about his style, which seems like an imitation of the earliest manner of Raphael and that of Pinturicchio in a weaker and less virile form. The chief of his numerous panel paintings are the Nativity, in the Vatican, and the Adoration of the Magi, at Berlin. In 1510 Lo Spagna executed many frescos at Todi, and in 1512 several other mural paintings in and near Trevi. His most important works were frescos at Assisi and Spoleto, of which some exist in good preservation. He received the freedom of the city of Spoleto in 1516, as a reward for his work there. As is so often the case, Lo Spagna’s frescos reach a much higher standard of merit than his panel pictures. The museum of the Capitol in Rome now possesses a very beautiful series of life-sized fresco figures by him, representing Apollo and the Nine Muses. These are drawn with a strong feeling for grace of pose and beauty of expression, and are very remarkable for the delicate refinement of their colouring; in style they strongly recall Raphael’s earliest manner. Lo Spagna was alive in 1528, but he appears to have died before 1530, as in that year a pupil of his named Doni completed a fresco in S. Jacopo, near Spoleto, which Lo Spagna had begun.
