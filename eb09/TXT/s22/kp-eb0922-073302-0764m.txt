SWATOW (also, less frequently, Swartow and Shan-row ), a port of China, in the province of Kwang-tung, opened to foreign trade in 1869. It is situated at the mouth of the main branch of the river Han, which 30 miles inland flows past the great city of Chow-chu or Tai-chu (Tie-chu), and the surrounding country is more populous and full of towns and villages than any other part of the province. English merchants settled on Double Island in the river as early as 1856; but the city, which is built on ground but recently recovered from the sea, was formerly a mere fishing village. The trade of the port has rapidly increased. In 1869 718 vessels of all nations entered or cleared (of 310,500 tons burden), in 1884 1387 vessels (1,282,936 tons)—the total value of the trade being respectively £4,800,000 and £5,519,772. The surrounding country is a great sugar-cane district producing annually about 2,000,000 piculs (= 133 1 / 3 lb) of sugar, and there is an extensive refinery in the town employing upwards of 600 workmen and possessing a reservoir for 7,000,000 gallons of water. Next in value comes the manufacture of bean-cake, which is also imported in large quanti-[9:22:734] ties from New-chwang, Chefoo, Shanghai, Amoy, and HongKong (total import in 1874, 1,408,384 piculs; in 1884, 2,539,710). Among the leading exports are tea (since about 1872); grass-cloth, manufactured at Swatow from so-called Taiwan hemp (the fibre of the Boehmeria nivea from Formosa); pine-apple cloth, manufactured in the villages about Kieh-Yang (a town 22 miles distant); oranges, for which the district is famous; cheap fans; and pewter, iron, and tin wares. Swatow is also a great emigration port. In 1870 about 22,000 Chinese embarked there for Singapore, Bangkok, and Saigon; and the number of emigrants has since increased so that British vessels alone carry 50,000 to 53,000 per annum. Of the whole foreign trade of the port upwards of 83 per cent. is in British bottoms, the trade with Hong-Kong being of especial importance. The population of Swatow is upwards of 30,000. In 1874 the foreign residents numbered 147 (63 British), including Double Island.

About 1865 the whole Swatow district was still divided into a number of “independent townships, each ruled by its own headmen,” and the population was described in the official gazetteer as “generally rebellious and wicked in the highest degree.” Mr Forrest, British consular agent, relates that in that year he was witness to the preparations for a fight between the people living on the opposite sides of the estuary, which was only prevented by an English war-vessel. The Taipings swept over the country, and by their ravages and plundering did much to tame the independence of the clans. The punishment inflicted in 1869 by Commander Jones on the inhabitants of Otingpui (Ou-ting-pei), about 8 miles from Swatow, for the attack they had made on the boats of H.M.S. “Cockchafer,” showed the Chinese authorities that such piratical villages were not so strong as had been supposed. General Fang (a native of Chow-chu-fu) was sent to reduce the district to order, and he carried out his instructions with remorseless rigour.
