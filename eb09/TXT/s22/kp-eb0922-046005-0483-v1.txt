STATIONERY. Under the name of stationery are embraced all writing materials and implements, together with the numerous appliances of the desk and of mercantile and commercial offices. In addition to these, the term fancy stationery covers a miscellaneous assemblage of leather and other goods, such as pocket-books, purses, bags, card-cases, and many kindred objects which cannot be classified. The principal articles and operations of the stationery trade are dealt with in detail under separate headings— Bookbinding, Embossing, Ink, Lithography, [9:22:461] Paper, Pen, Pencil, Sealing-wax, &c.; but in connexion with the separate industry of a commercial stationer there are a number of special operations and machines to which brief allusion may be made.

Paper-Ruling.— The ruling of blue and other coloured lines is usually done on a self-feeding machine provided with as many ruling pens as there are lines to be made, and these fixed in parallel order at intervals the width of the ruled spaces. The pens consist of grooved slips of sheet brass coming to a fine point, which in their upper part are covered by a sheet of felt saturated with a flowing ink, whence each pen obtains the supply required for tracing its line. The paper is carried forward by endless tapes or threads which pass around cylinders. In a recent form of machine the rulers consist of metal disks with thin edges, which take up printing ink from an india-rubber cylinder, and print the lines on the paper as it passes around a revolving cylinder.

Paper-Folding machinery is used for numerous purposes in the stationery trade, apart from its application to the folding of sheets for the bookbinder. Devices for folding come most prominently forward in connexion with the envelope manufacture, an industry which received an enormous development by the introduction of uniform postage rates. In envelope-making the folding is commonly associated with gumming, and sometimes with embossing, in the same system of machinery. The first efficient automatic machine for envelope manufacture was devised by Edwin Hill and Warren de la Rue, and by them patented in 1845. Many forms of envelope folding and gumming machine now exist. In making envelopes the blanks are first cut out by shaped cutters or punches acting at one stroke on a thickness of from 200 to 300 sheets of paper. These blanks in the latest form of machine are gummed by a pad which takes gum from a roller and presses it on the edges of the paper, just as printing ink is received from cylinders and pressed on paper in printing. The gummed surface of the pad lifts each blank separately, places it under a plunger, which, descending, passes it to folders, whence it is delivered into a clip in an endless band of considerable length. The envelopes are delivered into the clips in the band at the rate of about 100 to 150 per minute.

Perforating and Punching give rise to a range of machines of varied form and complexity. The idea of perforating paper so as to allow of the ready detaching of portions by tearing was conceived and. patented in 1848 by Mr Henry Archer. Of such utility was Mr Archer’s conception deemed by the post-office authorities as a convenience for detaching stamps from sheets that in 1853 he was awarded £4000 for his patent rights. The applications of perforation are now very numerous, but its value still remains most obvious in connexion with the detachment of adhesive stamps from sheets.

Numbering and Paging constitute another series of stationery operations, for which ingenious machines have been devised. For consecutive numbering a series of printing disks are employed, on the periphery of which the series of digits 1 to 0 are raised. The outer disk moves a number after each impression, the second disk moves once in ten times, and so on, thus automatically imprinting consecutive numbers up to the limit of the disks on the machine. Such a machine prints only on one side of the paper, and where the numbering is required on both sides the disks must be geared to move two places, numbering only odd or even numbers, two printings being thus required. For printing right and left consecutively an endless band machine is used, which prints alternately below and above for the two sides of the sheet.
