SYNAGOGUE (συvαγωγή ), literally “assemblage,” is the term employed to denote either a congregation of Jews, i.e., a local circle accustomed to meet together for worship and religious instruction, or the building in which the congregation met. In the first sense the word is a translation of כנםת, keneseth, in the second of כית הכנםח, bêth hakheneseth. The germ of the synagogue, that is, of religious assemblages dissociated from the ancient ritual of the altar, may be found in the circle of the prophets and their disciples (see especially Isa. viii. 16 sqj) ; but the synagogue as an institution characteristic of Judaism arose after the work of Ezra, and is closely connected with the development of that legal Judaism to which his reformation gave definite shape. From the time of Ezra downwards it was the business of every Jew to know the law; the school (beth ham-midrāsh) trained scholars, but the synagogue, where the law was read every Sabbath (Acts xv. 21), was the means of popular instruction. Such synagogues existed in all parts of Judaea in the time of Psalm lxxiv. 8 (probably a psalm of the Persian period); in Acts xv. 21 it appears that they had existed for many generations “in every city.” This held good not only for Palestine but for the Dispersion; in post-Talmudic times the rule was that a synagogue must be built wherever there were ten Jews. And, though the name “synagogue” varies with προσευχή (“place of prayer ”), it appears that everywhere the assemblage was primarily one for instruction in the law: the synagogue, as Philo puts it, was a διδασκαλειov . A formed institution[9:22:812] of this sort required some organization: the general order of the service was directed by one or more “rulers of the synagogue” (ἀρχισυνάγωγοι , Luke xiii. 14; Acts xiii. 15), who called on fit persons to read, pray, and preach; alms were collected by two or more “collectors” (gabbâe sedākā}·, and a “minister” (hazzān, ὑπηρέτης, Luke iv. 20) had charge of the sacred books (preserved in an “ark”) and of other ministerial functions, including the teaching of children to read. The discipline of the congregation was enforced by excommunication (hērem) or temporary exclusion (niddûy), and also by the minor punishment of scourging (Matt. x. 17), inflicted by the hazzân. The disciplinary power was in the hands of a senate of elders (πpεσβύτεpoι, γερουσία), the chief members of which were ἄρχοντες. The principal service of the synagogue was held on Sabbath morning, and included, according to the Mishnah, the recitation of the shema (Deut. vi. 4-9, xi. 13-21; Numb. xv. 37-41), prayer, lessons from the law and prophets with Aramaic translation, a sermon (derashah) based on the lesson (Acts xiii. 15), and finally a blessing pronounced by the priest or invoked by a layman. On Sabbath afternoon and on Monday and Thursday there was a service without a lesson from the prophets; there were also services for all feast-days. Synagogues were built by preference beside water for the convenience of the ceremonial ablutions (comp. Acts xvi. 13); and remains of very ancient buildings of this class exist in several parts of Galilee; they generally lie north and south, and seem to have had three doors to the south, and sometimes to have been divided by columns into a nave and two aisles.

Jewish tradition has a great deal to say about a body called “the great synagogue,” which is supposed to have been the supreme religious authority from the cessation of prophecy to the time of the high priest Simeon the Just, and is even said (by modern writers since Elias Levita) to have fixed the Old Testament canon (cp. vol. V. p. 3 sq.). But Kuenen in his essay “Over de Mannen der Groote Synagoge” (Verslagen of the Amsterdam Academy, 1876) has shown that these traditions are fiction, and that the name keneseth haggadôla originally denoted, not a standing authority, but the great convocation of Neh. viii.-x.

Compare in general Schürer, Geschichte des jüdischen Volkes, §27, where the older literature is catalogued. For the usages of the synagogue in more recent times, see Buxtorf, Synagoge Judaica, Basel, 1641.
