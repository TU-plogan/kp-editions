SUNDA ISLANDS, the collective name of the whole series of islands in the East Indian Archipelago which extend from the peninsula of Malacca to New Guinea. They are divided into the Great Sunda Islands— i.e., Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, Banca, and Billiton, with their adjacencies—and the Little Sunda Islands, of which the more important are Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Sandalwood Island, Adanara, Solor, Savu, Pantar, Ac.

Sunda Strait is the channel separating Sumatra from Java, and uniting the Indian Ocean with the Java Sea. It is 15 miles broad between the southmost point of Sumatra and the town of Anjer in Java. Right in the middle is the low-lying well-wooded island of Dwars in den Weg, otherwise Middle Island or Sungian. In 1883 Sunda Strait was the scene of the most terrific results of the eruption of Krakatoa, a volcano on the west side of the strait. The greater part of the island of Krakatoa was destroyed and two new islands, Steers Island and Calmeyer Island, were thrown up.
