STRY, or Stryj, a town of Galicia, Austria, is pleasantly situated on a tributary of the Dniester, about 40 miles to the south of Lemberg. In 1880 it contained 12,625 inhabitants, chiefly engaged in tanning and the manufacture of matches. In 1886, however, the town was almost wholly destroyed by fire, and its population was greatly reduced by the wholesale migration and deaths from privation consequent upon this calamity.
