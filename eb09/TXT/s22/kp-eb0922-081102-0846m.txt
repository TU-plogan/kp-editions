SYMEON, surnamed Metaphrastes, Byzantine hagio-grapher, according to Leo Allatius (De Symeonum Scriptis, Paris, 1664), lived during the first half of the 10th century under Leo the Philosopher and his successor at Constantinople, where he successively held the positions of secretary, grand logothete, and master of the palace. This view, subsequently adopted by Cave, Fabricius, and others, was afterwards disputed, but not convincingly, by Oudin (Comm. de Scriptt. Eccles. Antiq., vol. ii., 1722), who identified Metaphrastes with another Symeon who also held the offices of logothete and master of the palace under John Comnenus, and published a still extant Epitome Canonum in 1160. Symeon’s Metaphrases, as his legends are called (whence his name Metaphrastes), occur in MS. in many European libraries; many of them are also to be found in the Acta Sanctorum and similar collections; but others remain unprinted. Allatius and Cave recognize only 122 of the hundreds of lives assigned to him as genuine. The titles of other writings of Symeon, with references to further authorities, will be found in the article “Metaphrastes,” by Gass, in Herzog-Plitt’s Encykl., vol. ix.
