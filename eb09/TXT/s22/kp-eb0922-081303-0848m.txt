SYRA, or Syros, a Greek island in the middle of the Cyclades, which in the 19th century has become the commercial centre of the Archipelago, and is also the residence of the nomarch of the Cyclades and the seat of the central law courts. In ancient times this island was remarkably fertile, as is to be gathered not only from the Homeric description (Od. xv. 403), which might be of doubtful application, but also from the remains of olive presses and peculiarities in the local nomenclature. The destruction of its forests has led to the loss of all its alluvial soil, and now it is for the most part a brown and barren rock, covered at best with scanty aromatic scrub, pastured by sheep and goats. The length of the island is about 10 miles, the breadth 5, and the area is estimated at 42½ square miles. The population is now estimated to number about 33,700, of whom about 20,500 are in the chief town. Commerce is the main occupation of the islanders, though they also build ships, have extensive tanneries, large steam flour-mills, a steam weaving and rope factory, and a handkerchief factory, and grow vegetables for export.

Hermopolis, as the chief town is called, is built round the harbour on the east side of the island. It is governed by an active municipality, whose revenue and expenditure have rapidly increased. Among the public buildings are a spacious town-hall in the central square, a club-house, an opera-house, and a Greek theatre. Old Syra, on a conical hill behind the port town, is an interesting place, with its old Roman Catholic church of St George’s still crowning the summit. This was built by the Capuchins, who in the Middle Ages chose Syra as the headquarters of a mission in the East. Louis XIII., hearing of the dangers to which the Syra priests were exposed, took the island under his especial protection, and since that time the Roman Catholic bishops of Syra have been elected by the pope. About the beginning of the 19th century the inhabitants of Syra numbered only about 1000; whenever a Turkish vessel appeared they made off to the interior and hid themselves. On the outbreak of the war of Greek independence refugees from Chios, after being scattered throughout Tenos, Spezia, Hydra, &c., and rejected by the people of Ceos, took up their residence at Syra under the protection of the French fiag. Altogether about 40,000 had sought this asylum before the freedom of Greece was achieved. The chief city was called Hermopolis after the name of the ship which brought the earlier settlers. Most of the immigrants elected to stay, and, though they were long kept in alarm by pirates, they have continued steadily to prosper. In 1875 1568 sailing ships and 698 steamers (with a total of 740,731 tons) entered and 1588 sailing ships and 700 steamers (with a total of 756,807 tons) cleared this port; in 1883 3379 sailing and 1126 steam vessels (with a total of 1,056,201 tons) entered and 3276 sailing and 1120 steam vessels (with a total of 960,229 tons) cleared. Most of the sailing vessels were Greek and Turkish, and most of the steamers were Austrian, French, and Turkish.
