STOCKTON-ON-TEES, a market-town and municipal and parliamentary borough and seaport of Durham, on the borders of the North Riding of Yorkshire, into which the parliamentary borough extends, is situated on the Tees, which is crossed by an iron bridge (completed in 1887 at a cost over £80,000, to supersede the stone bridge of 1769) leading to South Stockton, and on the Stockton and Darlington and the Sunderland and West Hartlepool branches of the North-Eastern Railway, 20 miles south-south-east of Durham, and 4 miles west-south-west of Middlesborough. The principal street is about a mile in length. Of the ancient castle commanding the Tees, which was destroyed in 1652, the last remains were removed in 1865. Among the principal public buildings are the town-hall, with a clock-tower and spire, the borough hall (erected in 1852 at a cost of £32,000), the freemasons’ hall, the temperance hall, the theatre, the exchange hall, the literary institute, the hospital, the dispensary, the free library, and the blue-coat school. Stockton is a seaport of considerable importance. The management of the Tees, vested in 1808 in the Tees Navigation Company, was in 1852 vested in the Tees Conservancy Commissioners, incorporated by Act of Parliament, under whose auspices the river has been greatly improved. The trade of the port is chiefly with Holland and the ports of the Baltic, and there is a considerable coasting trade with the Tyne ports and with Hull and London. Its chief exports are iron manufactures, coal, coke, and agricultural produce, the average annual value for the five years 1880-84 being about <£72,000. The principal imports are timber, iron, grain, and provisions, the average annual value for the five years 1880-84 being about £240,000. In 1885 the number of vessels that entered the port was 649, of 149,628 tons, the number that cleared 700, of 175,647 tons. The rapid increase of the town within the last quarter of a century is largely owing to the development of the iron and steel trade in the district. There are extensive steel works, blastfurnaces, iron and brass foundries, and rolling-mills, and iron-shipbuilding is also an important industry. There are also sailcloth works, potteries, breweries, and brick and tile works. The population of the municipal borough (area 1189 acres) in 1871 was 27,738, and in 1881 it was 41,015. The population of the parliamentary borough (area 7157 acres) in the same years was 37,612 and 55,457. The parliamentary borough includes the suburb of South Stockton on the opposite side of the river, forming a separate urban sanitary district (area 1052 acres), with a population in 1871 of 6794 and in 1881 of 10,665. It has a temperance hall, a mechanics’ institute, and a national school, and its manufactures are similar to those of Stockton.

The place is of great antiquity, and is supposed to have been occupied by the Romans. Before the Conquest the manor belonged to the see of Durham. It was probably first incorporated by Bishop Hugh de Pudsey, who in the reign of Richard I. occupied the castle. The castle, which was for a long time the residence of the bishops, stood on the north bank of the Tees. The town was destroyed by the Scots in 1322, but the castle seems to have escaped. During the Civil War it was garrisoned for the king, but was afterwards delivered up to the Parliamentary party, and in 1645 was held by the Scots. The town suffered severely from inundations of the Tees in 1771, 1783, and 1822. Though Stockton was placed under the Municipal Act of 1835 it remained divided into two parts, the one called the “borough,” where the land was freehold, governed by the corporation, and the other called the “town,” where the land was copyhold or leasehold, held under the vicar and vestrymen, and outside the corporate jurisdiction. To remedy this state of matters an “Extension and Improvement Act” was passed in 1852. The town was enfranchised in 1867, and returns one member.
