SUETONIUS. Caius Suetonius Tranquillus was one of the many second-rate authors and men of letters who lived in the early period of the Roman empire. He was the contemporary of Tacitus and the younger Pliny, and his literary work seems to have been chiefly done in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. His father was an officer in the army and military tribune in the XIIIth legion, and he himself began life as an advocate. To us he is known as the biographer of the twelve Caesars, from Caius Julius down to Domitian. These lives are valuable as covering a good deal of ground where we are without the guidance of Tacitus. As Suetonius was the emperor Hadrian’s private secretary, he must have had access to many important documents. It would seem from occasional references which he makes to himself in the course of the work that he was a youngish man in the reign of Domitian, and so would have had opportunities of conversing with men who had lived in the days of Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius, Nero, and had been present at the scenes of civil war and anarchy which followed the reign of the last-named. The most interesting fact about Suetonius is that he was a friend and correspondent of the younger Pliny, and the fact certainly tells in his favour. Several of Pliny’s letters are addressed to him, and they all imply esteem and intimate friendship. Sometimes we find Pliny putting in a good word for him, as, for instance, on one occasion doing his best to help him in buying a small property at a fair price, not very far from Rome, with a house of moderate size and land enough to amuse but not to engross a man of scholarly tastes (i. 24). In another letter (v. 10) he playfully rallies him on his dilatoriness in publishing his works. Pliny does not mention the subject of these works. Again he recommends him to the favourable notice of the emperor Trajan, “as a most upright, honourable, and learned man, whom persons often remember in their wills because of his merits,” and he begs that he may be made legally capable of inheriting these bequests, for which under a special enactment Suetonius was, as a childless married man, disqualified. Trajan granted Pliny’s request (x. 94, 95). Hadrian’s biographer, Spartianus, tells us that Suetonius had his private secretaryship taken from him because he and some others of the imperial officials were not sufficiently observant of court etiquette towards the emperor’s wife during his absence in Britain.

The Lives of the Caesars has always been a popular work, at least with scholars, and has been frequently edited, as well as translated into most modern languages, the latest English translation being that of Thomson in 1796. The lives of the first six Caesars are much fuller than those of the last six; this shows that he was an industrious compiler rather than an original historian. He gives us no picture of the society of the time, no hints as to the general character and tendencies of the period. It is the emperor, the emperor only, who is always before us, and yet after all the portrait is but a sorry performance, drawn without any real historical judgment or insight. It is the personal anecdotes he tells us, several of which are very amusing, that give his lives their chief interest; but he panders rather too much to a taste for scandal and gossip. A good many of his scandalous stories about the emperors may be and probably are fictions, but at any rate they reflect the gossip of the time. Still we owe him thanks for having thrown some light on an important period, parts of which are very obscure.

Suetonius is said to have been a voluminous writer, and among his works Suidas mentions treatises on the Roman Year, Cicero s Republic, The Kings, The Pedigree of Illustrious Romans, and Rome, its Institutions and Customs, with several others,—works, it would seem, of learned research. Under his name have come down to us Lives of Terence, Juvenal, Horace, Persius, Lucan, and. his friend the younger Pliny; but the genuineness of these is. highly questionable, and that of the last is hardly worth considering. There is also a work entitled De illustribus grammaticis,· —a “grammaticus being what we should call “a professor of language and literature.
