SKITTLES. This English game, which somewhat resembles American bowls (see vol. iv. p. 180), was formerly known as Kails (Fr. quilles), and first came into vogue in England in the 14th century. Nine large ovalheaded pins with flat bottoms, and made of a hard wood, are set up on a wooden frame, three pins square on each side. An angle and not an even side of the said square is presented towards the player, who stands at the distance of 21 feet. There may be one or two players a-side; and the object of each side is to knock down, or “floor,” the greatest number of pius in the least possible number of throws, which are generally two or three, though they may extend to five, according to agreement. The roundish ball used for throwing weighs from 8 to 14 lb, and in fair playing only one step forward is allowed in delivery. A firm grasp should be taken of the ball in a slightly slanting position, so as to strike the fore pin on the shoulder and then reach the back ones. A player who clears the board in two throws may be considered a good all-round one. In different localities there are minor variations in playing the game.
