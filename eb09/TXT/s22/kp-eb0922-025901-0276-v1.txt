SOMERSET, Edward Seymour, Duke of (c. 1500- 1552), eldest brother of Jane Seymour, Henry VIII.’s third wife, was created earl of Hertford in 1537, on the birth of his nephew, afterwards Edward VI. In 1544 he commanded in the war with Scotland, and sacked Edinburgh. Next year he again commanded against the Scots; and he was employed by Henry in many important negotiations throughout the latter part of his reign. On the accession of Edward VI. he was made protector by the council, and was soon afterwards created duke of Somerset. He at once made use of his power to encourage the extreme Reformers, and a general destruction of ecclesiastical works of art was the result. In September 1547, finding the Scots unwilling to listen to his proposals for a marriage between Edward and Mary Stuart, he marched an army into Scotland and won the battle of Γinkie Cleugh,—a worthless victory, which only threw Scotland into the arms of France. War with that country followed, and the result was the loss of Boulogne. Equally disastrous was the protector’s domestic policy. He was animated by a dislike of arbitrary government, and by a desire to improve the condition of the poor, but was at the same time a slave to his own ambition. He[9:22:260] pushed on the Protestant Reformation with inconsiderate speed, repealed the Treason Acts of Henry VIII.’s reign, and issued a commission to inquire into agricultural distress. The agitation into which these measures threw the country produced insurrections in the west and east, which were with some difficulty suppressed. Irritated by his arrogance, rashness, and incapacity, the council, in October 1549, turned against him, deprived him of the protectorate, and confined him in the Tower. Released in 1550, he recovered much of his influence through the misgovernment of his successors, and contemplated a return to power at their expense. His plans being discovered, he was tried on a charge of felony, and executed on January 22, 1552. His popularity was immense, and in some respects deserved; but he aspired to a tyranny, and had he retained or recovered power he would have gone far towards ruining the nation.
