SUSA (Susa), a city of Tunis, on the coast of the gulf of Hamáma, 33 miles south of Hamáma. It occupies the side of a hill sloping seawards,· and is still, as far as the town proper is concerned, surrounded with heavy white-[9:22:723] washed Oriental-looking walls. The Kasr al-Ribát, a square building flanked by seven bastions, was probably either a Roman or Byzantine fortress, and a Byzantine chapel is now transformed into the Kahwat al-Kubba or Café of the Dome. Since the French annexation the citadel, built on the highest point within the town, has been entirely restored and serves as the headquarters of the general commanding a division; and a camp of tile-roofed brick buildings has been erected in the neighbourhood. The space within the walls is proving too limited for the growth of the population, and houses already extend along the shore to north and south for about a mile. Susa is the aneient seaport of Kairwan (45 miles inland), with which it is connected by a horse-tramway, and it has a rapidly increasing commerce. In 1864 the port was visited by about 195 vessels, in 1885 by 701, of which 532 were Italian. The exports in 1885 were valued at £1,371,510 (oil, to Genoa and Leghorn, £232,530; grain, largely to Sicily, £397,760; sansa or olive refuse, to France, £13,715; esparto, a comparatively recent article for this port, £17,935), and the imports (including building-stone from Sicily and Malta, brick, lime, marble, and timber) amounted to £660,135. The population, which numbered 8000 in 1872 (2000 Jews, 1000 Christians), had increased to upwards of 10,000 in 1886.

Susa is the ancient Hλdrumetum (q.v.). In 1537 it was besieged by the marquis of Terra Nova, in the service of Charles V., and in 1539 was captured for the emperor by Andrea Doria. But as soon as the imperial forces were withdrawn it became again the seat of Turkish piracy. The town was attacked by the French and the Knights of St John in 1770, and by the Venetians in 1764.
