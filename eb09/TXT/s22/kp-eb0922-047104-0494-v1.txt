STAVANGER, a seaport town of Norway, the administrative centre of an “amt” of the same name (population 114,164 in 1876), is situated on the west coast, on the south side of a beautiful fjord, about 127 miles north-west of Christiansand. A railway to connect Stavanger with Christiania has been planned, but as yet only the terminal portions have been constructed, the Stavanger portion, which runs south to Ekersund for 47 miles, being opened in 1878. The town is for the most part a collection of narrow and irregular streets, but signs of the wealth acquired by its shipping trade and herring fishery appear in the well-built stone houses erected since the great fire of 1860. In 1884 314 vessels (70,006 tons) entered the harbour and 267 (57,479 tons) cleared. Though the bishop’s see was removed from Stavanger to Christiansand in 1685, the old cathedral of St Swithun’s, founded by the English bishop Reinald in the end of the 11th century, and rebuilt after being burned down in 1272, still remains, and, next to the cathedral of Trondhjem, is the most interesting piece of Gothic architecture in Norway. The old episcopal palace of Kongsgaard is now a Latin school. The communal hospital is an important institution. The town dates from the 8th or 9th century and became the seat of a bishopric in the 13th. In 1801 the population of[9:22:472] Stavanger was only 2500; by 1855 it was 12,000, and by 1875 20,350.
