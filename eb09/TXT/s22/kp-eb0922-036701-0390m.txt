SPALDING, a market-town of Lincolnshire, England, in the Parts of Holland, is situated on the river Welland, and on the Great Northern and Great Eastern Railways, 93 miles from London. The town, standing in the heart of the Fens, is the centre of a rich agricultural district. Amongst the public buildings are five churches, the Johnson hospital (1881), the corn exchange (1856-57), the buildings of the mechanics’ institute and of the Christian association and literary institute, and the district union-house. The parish church of St Mary and St Nicholas was built in 1284 and restored in 1865-66. The adjoining lady chapel (St Mary and St Thomas a Becket) was built in 1315; in 1588 it was appropriated for the grammar school endowed in 1568 by John Blanke and again in 1588 by John Gamlyn. A new grammar school was erected in 1881. Spalding has had a prison for upwards of 600 years; the present building, erected in 1824-25, was closed in 1884. The Welland is crossed at Spalding by two stone bridges. The existing high bridge, constructed in 1838, took the place of a wooden erection dating from the end of the 17th century; this last was built on the site of an older Roman bridge of two arches, the foundations of the centre pier of which were disclosed when the wooden bridge was constructed. The population of the town in 1871 was 9111, and in 1881 9260.

In 1051 Thorold of Bockenhale (now Bucknall, near Horncastle) gave his castle of Spalding and the chapel attached to it as a cell or monastery for the Benedictines of Crowland. Out of this grew the priory, which, however, was dissolved in 1535; the last fragments of its ruins were removed in 1832. About two miles north-east of Spalding stands the ruined chapel of Wykeham, dedicated to St Nicholas and built in 1311 by Prior Clement Hatfield. The building is of the Decorated period, and has been roofless since 1782; its interior dimensions are 43 feet long by 22 feet wide; the walls are 44 ½ feet high. Each side contains three three-light windows with moulded flowing tracery, and each end one four-light window of similar character. The only one which retains its original mullions and tracery is the centre window on the south side. After the Conquest the estates and priory of Spalding were given by William I. to Ivo Tailbois, who found such a stout antagonist in Hereward the Wake, lord of Brunne or Bourn.
