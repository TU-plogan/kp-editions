STEPHANUS BYZANTIUS, the author of a geographical dictionary entitled 'E θvικα , of which, apart from some fragments, we possess only the beggarly epitome of one Hermolaus. This work was first edited under the title II ερὶ πόλεων (Aldus, Venice, 1502); there are modern editions by Dindorf (1825), Westermann (1839), and Meineke (vol. i., 1850). Even in the imperfect form in which we have it the book is of great value from the references to ancient writers which it preserves. Hermolaus dedicates his epitome to Justinian; whether the first or second emperor of that name is meant is disputed, but it seems probable that Stephanus flourished in the earlier part of the 6th century.
