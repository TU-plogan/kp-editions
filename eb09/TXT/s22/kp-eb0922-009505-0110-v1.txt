The business of Sirájganj is that of a changing station; the agricultural produce of the surrounding country is brought in in small boats and transferred to wholesale merchants for shipment to Calcutta in steamers or large cargo boats, and in return piece goods, salt, hardware, and all sorts of miscellaneous articles are received from Calcutta for distribution. Sirájganj is also the centre of the jute trade of Eastern Bengal.
