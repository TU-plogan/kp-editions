SULTÁNPUR, or Sultanpoor, a district of British India, in the Rái Bareli (Roy Bareilly) division of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, lying between 26° 39' and 27° 58' N. lat. and 81° 36' and 82° 44' E. long. With an area of 1707 square miles, it is bounded on the N. by Faizábád, on the E. by Jaunpur, on the S. by Partábgarh, and on the W. by Rái Bareli. The surface of the district is generally level, being broken only by ravines in the neighbourhood of the rivers by which its drainage is effected. The central portion of the district is highly cultivated, while in the south are widespread arid plains and swampy jhils and marshes. The principal river is the Gumti, which passes through the centre of Sultánpur and affords a valuable highway for commerce. Minor streams are the Kándu, Pili, Tengha, and Nandhia, the last two being of some importance, as their channels are deep, though narrow, and form the outlet for the superfluous water of the extensive series of jhils. There are no forests in the district, the only tree-covered tracts being stunted dhák jungles used for fuel. Wild animals are very few, chiefly wolves, nylghau, and wild hog. There are some good roads in the district, chief of which is the imperial high road from Faizábád to Allahábád, which intersects it from north to south. The Oudh and Rohilkhand Railway traverses the district for a few miles in the extreme east. The climate is considered mild, temperate, and healthy; the average annual rainfall is about 46 inches.

The population, according to the census of 1881, was 957,912 (males 475,125, females 482,787), of whom 856,329 were Hindus and 101,524 Mohammedans. The only town with a population exceeding 5000 is Sultánpur, the administrative headquarters of the district, which is situated on the right bank of the Gumti, and in 1881 contained 9374 inhabitants. Of the total area 571,795 acres were returned as cultivated in 1884-85 aud 368,911 as cultivable; the total area under crops in the same year was 672,058 acres, wheat and rice being the principal products. The trade of the district deals principally with grain, cotton, molasses, and native cloth, and its manufactures—which, however, are unimportant—comprise coarse cotton cloth, brass vessels and other metal work, sugar, and indigo. The only incident worthy of note in the history of the district since the British annexation of Oudh is the revolt of the native troops stationed at Sultánpur during the mutiny. The troops rose in rebellion on 9th June 1857, and, after filing on and murdering two of their officers, sacked the station. L pon the restoration of order Sultánpur cantonment was strengthened by a detachment of British troops; but in 1861 it was entirely abandoned as a military station.
