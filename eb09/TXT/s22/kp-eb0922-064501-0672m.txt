SUMY, a district town of Little Russia, in the government of Kharkoff, situated 125 miles to the north-west of the chief town of the government, was founded in 1652 by Little Russian Cossacks. It is poorly built, chiefly of wood, but is an important centre for the trade of Great Russia with Little Russia,â€”cattle and corn being sent to the north in exchange for various kinds of manufactured and grocery wares. It has a classical pro-gymnasium and a technical school. Its inhabitants, who numbered 16,030 in 1884, are engaged in commerce, in various kinds of petty trades, and in agriculture.
