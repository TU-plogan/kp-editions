SOPHIA DOROTHEA (1666-1726), the daughter and heiress of Duke George William of Brunswick-Lüneburg-Celle, was born on September 15, 1666. On November 21, 1682, she was married to Prince George Louis of Hanover, afterwards George I. of England, to whom she bore in 1683 a son, afterwards King George II., and in 1687 a daughter, Sophia Dorothea, afterwards the wife of Frederick William I. of Prussia and the mother of Frederick the Great. For her illicit relations with Count Philip Christopher von Königsmark (see vol. x. p. 420) Sophia Dorothea was divorced from her husband the elector in December 1694, and the remainder of her life was spent in a dignified captivity under a military guard at her ancestral seat of Ahlden. She died on November 13, 1726. Her correspondence with Königsmark was discovered at Lund by Prof. Palmblad, and published by him in 1847; see also the Count von Schulenburg’s Herzogin von Ahlden (Leipsic, 1852).
