SIEYÈS, Emmanuel Joseph (1748-1836), one of the chief political thinkers and writers of the period of the French Revolution and the first empire, was born at Fréjus (Var) on 3d May 1748. He was destined for the church, was educated by the Jesuits, became a licentiate of the canon law, and, having early distinguished himself by the astuteness and originality of his ideas, was appointed vicar-general by the bishop of Chartres. He shared the political fervour of the party of advance, and was fearlessly logical in working out the new and as yet indistinct princi-[9:22:46] ples of reform. An excellent opportunity was provided for the inculcation of his views by the invitation which Necker addressed to all French writers to publish their opinions upon the mode of convening the states-general. Sieyès startled his countrymen by the issue of various pamphlets upon the political situation, and particularly by his daring and original treatise upon the Third Estate, with its three famous divisions in question and answer:—“1st, What is the Third Estate?—Everything. What has it hitherto been in the political order?—Nothing. What does it demand?—To become something.” He attacked unsparingly the privileged classes, and indeed in this his most famous work he constructed, single-handed and at once, a programme for the Revolution. The influence of the book and of its author soon became enormous, and in 1789 the Abbé Sieyès was elected by the city of Paris as a representative to the states-general, where he was the first to propose that the three estates should meet together in one assembly. On the rejection of his motion he boldly suggested the formation of an “assembly of representatives of France already verified.” He was not, however, successful as a speaker, his style being obscure and his matter too compressed for oral expression,—faults which disappeared when he committed his thoughts to writing. Yet he was one of the leaders of the assembly, and was appointed a member of the committee on the constitution. His published speech in opposition to the power of absolute veto by the king brought him still further into notice. But he recognized his inaptitude for public speaking, and, although even Mirabeau declared that the silence of Sieyès was a public calamity, he stood aside while his own ideas were being developed amidst violence and riot both within and without the constituent and afterwards the legislative assembly. As excess followed upon excess in the wild course of the Revolution Sieyès had neither the courage nor the power to quell the riot. In danger of becoming a suspect, and fearful of his life, he emerged from obscurity in November 1793, on the occasion of the installation of Reason in Notre Dame. Before the national convention he denied his faith, abjuring the title of priest, professing that his only worship was that of liberty and equality and his only religion the love of humanity and country, and concluding by formally renouncing to the state the commuted pension which he enjoyed in lieu of his former benefice. The overthrow of the Jacobins at last overcame his fears and in March 1795 he is found publicly lauding the memory of those guillotined Girondists in whose defence he, two years before, had never once lifted his voice.

In the same year (1795) the ex-abbé was commissioned by the Convention to The Hague, where he successfully concluded an offensive and defensive alliance between the United Provinces and France. Without Sieyès no framing of a constitution could be attempted, and he was accordingly appointed member of a commission to draw up organic laws, the constitution of 1793 having been found unworkable. When the commission brought forward its report Sieyès did not dissent; but he proposed to the Convention a separate scheme of his own, the specialty of which was the provision for the appointment of a constitutional jury which should be charged with the duty of revising all legislative decrees against which the challenge was brought that they were themselves at variance with the constitution. His scheme was, however, rejected in favour of the new constitution, and from that moment he became its secret enemy. He was elected one of the first directory of five, but he declined the honour. In 1798 he was appointed the plenipotentiary of France to Prussia, where he was received with great honour and where he speedily began to plot against the Government he represented.

He communicated his views to Napoleon, then in Egypt. Meanwhile (1799) he was again elected to the directory, and, his plans being ripe, he accepted office. Then came the coup d'état of 18th Brumaire (9th November 1799), in which Sieyès took so important a part, but in which he was unquestionably overborne by the genius and audacity of Bonaparte. The provisional consulate composed of Napoleon, Sieyès, and Ducos lasted but a few weeks. After a little Sieyès is a count of the empire and the proprietor of Crosne (Seine-et-Oise), while Napoleon is able to boast of how he has bribed the ex-abbé out of his constitutional views. Amid the political changes of France, Sieyès on the second return of the Bourbons fled to Brussels; but after the revolution of 1830 he felt it safe to return to Paris, where he died on 20th June 1836.
