STOLBERG, Count Frederick Leopold (1750-1819), the brother of the preceding, was born on the 7th November 1750, at Bramstedt in Holstein. Like his brother he studied at Göttingen, and was a member of the “Dichterbund.” In 1776 he went to Copenhagen as ambassador of the prince-bishop of Lübeck, and in 1789 he was sent to Berlin as the ambassador of the king of Denmark. His first wife, whom he had married in 1782, having died, he married the Countess Sophia von Redern in 1790, and in the following year he was appointed president of the government of the prince-bishop at Eutin. In 1800 he resigned his office, and at Münster joined the Church of Rome, taking with him all the members of his family except his eldest daughter Agnes, who had married Count Ferdinand von Stolberg-Wernigerode. Stolberg’s friends and admirers were astonished by his conversion to the Roman Church, and he was hotly attacked by Voss, whose intervention gave rise to a bitter controversy. After his change of faith Stolberg issued an elaborate Geschichte der Religion Jesu Christi, in which he hardly even attempted to write with impartial judgment. He died near Osnabrück on the 5th December 1819.

In association with his brother he published Gedichte; Schauspiele mit Choren ; and Vaterländische Gedichte. He also wrote Iamben (1784), a series of satires on the vices and prejudices of his time; and he translated the Iliad, some of Plato’s dialogues, four tragedies of Aeschylus, and Ossian’s poems. Among his prose writings may be mentioned Die Insel, a romance (1788); Eine Reise in Deutschland, der Schweiz, Italien, und Sicilien (1794); and his Leben Alfred's des Grossen (1815). He was a master of many forms of poetical expression, and in his best period he produced a strong impression on his contemporaries by his passion for nature and freedom.

Biographies of Stolberg have been written by Nicolovius, Menge, Wiedel, Hennes, and Janssen.
