SUWALKI, capital of the above government, is situated at the source of the Hancza, tributary of the Niemen, 75 miles north-west of Grodno. In the 15th century it was but a small village, lost amidst forests, and peopled by Lithuanians. In the end of the 18th century it became the capital of the Augustowo government, but never had any importance, except as the seat of the local authorities. Since 1834 it has been the capital of the government of Suwatki. Its population was 18,640 in 1882.
