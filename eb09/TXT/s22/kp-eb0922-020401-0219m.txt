SOAP BARK. A vegetable principle known as “saponin,” and chemically analogous to the arabin of soluble gums and to mucilage, forms with water a lather, and is on that account available as a substitute for soap. Saponin is obtainable from soap nuts, the fruit of a tree, Saponaria officinalis and allied species; but its most important source is the Quillai bark of Chili yielded by a large tree, Quillaja saponaria. The inner bark of the tree, reduced to powder, is employed in Chili as a substitute for soap.
