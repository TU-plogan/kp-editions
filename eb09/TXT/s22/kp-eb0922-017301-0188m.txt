SMITH, James (1775-1839) and Horace (1779-1849), sons of an eminent and prosperous London solicitor, were born, the former on 10th February 1775 and the latter on 31st December 1779, both in London. They were joint authors of the Rejected Addresses, described by Horace as “one of the luckiest hits in literature.” The occasion of this happy jeu d'esprit was the rebuilding of Drury Lane theatre in 1812, after a fire in which it had been burnt down. The managers had offered a prize of £50 for an address to be recited at the reopening in October. Six weeks before that date the happy thought occurred to the brothers Smith of feigning that the most popular poets of the time had been among the competitors and issuing a volume of unsuccessful addresses in parody of their various styles. They divided the task between them, James taking Wordsworth, Southey, Coleridge, and Crabbe, while Byron, Moore, Scott, and Bowles were assigned to Horace.^[1. The particulars of the authorship are given in the 18th edition (1820), and in the memoir of his brother by Horace prefixed to a collection of fugitive pieces (1840). James contributed the first stanza to the imitation of Byron, but otherwise they worked independently. ] The parodists were ready with their small volume by October, but they had some difficulty in getting a publisher, although the success of their clever imitations once published was such that seven editions were called for within three months. The Rejected Addresses are the most widely popular parodies ever published in England, and have taken quite a classical rank in that kind of literature. The brothers fairly divided the honours: the elder brother’s Wordsworth is evenly balanced by the younger’s Scott, and both had a hand in Byron. A striking feature in the parodies is the absence of malice; none of the caricatured bards took offence, while the imitation is so clever that both Byron and Scott are recorded to have said in effect that they could hardly believe they had not written the addresses ascribed to them.

After this brilliant success James, the elder brother, determined, as he said, “to leave off a winner’’and follow Warburton’s advice to Anstey: “Young man, you have written a highly successful work; never put pen to paper again.” He was tempted occasionally to transgress this self-denying ordinance, and made another hit in writing Country Cousins, A Trip to Paris, A Trip to America, and other lively skits for Charles Mathews, earning from the comedian the praise of being “the only man who can write clever nonsense.” His social reputation as a wit stood high. He was reputed one of the best of conversers in an age when the art was studied, and it was remarked that he held his own without falling into the great error of wits,—sarcasm. But for all his good-nature he did not wholly escape the Charybdis of great talkers,—the charge of being something of a bore. In his old age the irreverent Fraser's put him in its gallery of living portraits as a gouty and elderly but painstaking joker. He died in London on 26th December 1839.

Horace Smith was less timorously careful of his poetical reputation than his elder brother, whom he survived, and, after making a fortune as a stockbroker, followed in the wake of Scott and wrote about a score of historical novels, —Βrambletye House, Tor Hill, Reuben Apsley, Zillah, The New) Forest, Walter Colyton, &c. His sketches of eccentric character are brilliant and amusing; but he was more of an essayist than a story-teller. He began in 1826, when Scott, still retaining his hold on the public, had made success impossible for imitators with less wealth of historical substance and inferior command of stirring incident. As he went on he encountered such competitors as Bulwer Lytton, Disraeli, Marryat, and Dickens. Still Horace Smith established a fair reputation, and some of his novels may still be found in the smoking-rooms of country houses. He was also a frequent contributor to the New Monthly Magazine under the editorship of Campbell. Three volumes of Gaieties and Gravities, published in 1826, contain many witty essays both in prose and in verse, but the only single piece that has taken a permanent place is the “Address to the Mummy in Belzoni’s Exhibition.” There is more of earnest in this than is generally found in his jesting. In private life Horace Smith was not less popular than his brother, though less ambitious of renown as a talker. It was of him that Shelley said: “Is it not odd that the only truly generous person I ever knew who had money enough to be generous with should be a stockbroker? He writes poetry and pastoral dramas and yet knows how to make money, and does make it, and is still generous.” Horace Smith died at Tunbridge Wells on 12th July 1849.
