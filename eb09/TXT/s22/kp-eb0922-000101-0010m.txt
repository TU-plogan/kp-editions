SIBBALD, Sir Robert (1641-1712), may be considered as the most eminent representative of science and medicine in Scotland towards the close of the 17th century. He was born near Leslie in Fifeshire in 1641. Educated at Edinburgh, Leyden, and Paris, he settled as a physician in Edinburgh and soon rose to eminence. His career is one of marked initiative: he was the first professor of medicine in the university of Edinburgh, and the first president of the college of physicians, and, along with Sir Andrew Balfour, founded the botanic garden. He was also geographer-royal, and his numerous and miscellaneous writings deal effectively with historical and antiquarian as well as botanical and medical subjects. He died in 1712.

Amongst Sibbaldâ€™s historical and antiquarian works may be mentioned A History of Fife and Kinross (Edinburgh, 1710, and Cupar, 1803), which is still indispensable to the student of local history and antiquities; An Account of the Scottish Atlas (folio, Edinburgh, 1683); Vindiciae Scoticae Illustratae (folio, Edinburgh, 1710); and Description of the Isles of Orkney and Shetland (folio, Edinburgh, 1711 and 1845). See also his Autobiography (Edinburgh, 1833), to which is prefixed an account of his MSS.
