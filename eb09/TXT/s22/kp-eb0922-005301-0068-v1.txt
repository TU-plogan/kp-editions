SILICA, the only known oxide of silicon (see Chemistry, vol. v. pp. 521-524), occurs native in a great variety of forms, which, however, correspond to only the four distinct species of Quartz ( q.v .; see also Mineralogy, vol. xvi. p. 389), tridymite, Opal ( q.v ., and compare vol. xvi. p. 390), and siliceous earth. Ordinary quartzrock and sand are more impure forms of quartz. Tridymite differs from quartz only by a lower specific gravity, and in crystallometric details; the crystals are as a rule arranged in triplets—hence the name (see vol. xvi. p. 389). Sili ceous earth when dry forms a very voluminous, soft, fine powder; it consists of the shells of Infusoria. As a chemical species it differs little from opal. Siliceous earth, having a very low rate of thermal conductivity, serves well as a stuffing for the hollow walls of ice-chests, fire-proof safes, &c. It is used besides for the making of Dynamite ( q.v. ) . Silica of any kind is absolutely nonvolatile, and is fusible only at the temperature of the oxyhydrogen flame; a slight admixture of base (potash, lime, &c.), however, suffices to cause it to “frit ” at a red heat. It is absolutely proof against the action of water and ordinary mineral acids; hydrofluoric acid acts on it energetically, as explained in Chemistry, vol. v. p. 522.

Alkaline Silicates.— Silica readily dissolves at a red heat in fused alkaline carbonates, with evolution of carbonic acid and formation of alkaline silicates. In this process one molecule SiO 2 of silica is capable of decomposing at most 2R 2 OCO 2 (where R=K or Na). The compound SiO 2 .2R 2 O, “orthosilicate” of alkali, freezes into a compact non-transparent mass, readily soluble in water, with formation of an intensely alkaline solution. It does not unite with any additional alkali, but readily fuses up with more silica. Without going beyond a red heat it is easy to produce thus homogeneous masses of any composition, Na 2 O. x SiO 2 from x = ½ up to x =(at least) 4.

Compounds approximating to x = 4 are known as water glass. Potash water glass, K 2 O.4SiO 2 , was discovered in 1825 by Fuchs in[9:22:54] Munich, who noticed all its practically important properties and saw their significance. Water glass when in compact pieces looks like ordinary glass, and is not at all obviously attacked by cold water. But when the powdered substance is boiled with water it dissolves, and the solution can be boiled down to the consistence of a syrup without anything separating out even in the cold. Such water-glass syrup, when applied as a coating to wood, pasteboard, &c., dries up into a coherent varnish which renders the object non-inflammable, because in the heat of a fire the coating melts into a continuous viscid covering which prohibits access of oxygen to the interior. The early application of water glass to the scenery of the Munich court theatre explains its long immunity from destructive fires. When mixed with powdered chalk, magnesite, phosphate of lime, and many other similar materials, it gradually unites with these into hard stone-like masses. Caustic lime and magnesia (MgO) thus unite with it with exceptional promptitude, with elimination of alkali. Water glass, in short, is to the class of mineral substances referred to what ordinary glue is to wood and paper, &c., and it is used largely for analogous purposes. Fuchs himself based upon this property of his preparation a new process of wall painting which was subsequently developed and brought to great perfection by Kaulbach and others. In this process of “stereochromy,” as it is called, the more immediate basis for the painting consists of a thin layer of a kind of cement made up of powdered marble, dolomite, quartz, and air-worn quicklime with water glass. On it the colours are laid with plain water, which causes them to stick on, but quite loosely, so that the artist can work at leisure and correct mistakes. The finished painting is fixed by applying to it a spray of water glass solution, which, in the course of a few days makes it perfectly fast. All that then remains to be done is to wash the painting with alcohol to remove the eliminated alkali and any dust that may have collected. A stereochromic painting (unlike one made by the old fresco process) is practically proof against atmospheric influences, even under a northern climate. In a water-glass solution the alkali is, so to say, only half combined with the silica; part of it in fact must be presumed to be present in the free state. At any rate the solution emulsionizes fats, and therefore is a cleansing agent in the same sense as soap-solution is. Water glass and other alkaline silicates are accordingly used as additions to some of the cheaper kinds of soap.
