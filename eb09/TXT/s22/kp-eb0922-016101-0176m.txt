SŁONIM, a district town of Russia, in the government of Grodno, 105 miles south-east of Grodno and 20 from the railway from Moscow to Warsaw, on the high craggy banks of the Schara. It derives its importance from this river, which is navigable and enters the system of the Oginski Canal connecting the Niemen with the Dnieper. Corn, tar, and especially timber are exported annually to a large amount, which in 1882 reached the value of £20,700. The population was 21,110 in 1883.

Słonim is a very old town, being mentioned in 1040, when Yaroslaff defeated the Lithuanians in its neighbourhood and compelled them to acknowledge his rule. In 1241 the Mongols, under Batyi, pillaged it and burned its wooden fort. Owing to its position between Galician Russia and Lithuania, it often changed hands until it was conquered by the Lithuanians in the 14th century. From 1631 to 1685 it was the seat of the Lithuanian seim and became a flourishing city. In the 18th century, under the hetman Oginski, a canal was dug to connect the Schara with the Dnieper. Oginski embellished the city and founded there a printing-office. Russia annexed the town in 1795.
