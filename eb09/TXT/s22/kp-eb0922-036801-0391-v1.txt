SPANDAU, a strongly-fortified town in the province of Brandenburg, Prussia, is situated at the confluence of the Havel and Spree, 8 miles to the north-west of Berlin. It has recently been converted into a fortress of the first class, and is now the key of the defences of the capital. The Julius tower in the citadel, which is surrounded by water, contains the imperial war treasure (Reichskriegsschatz),—a sum of £6,000,000 in gold, kept in readiness for any warlike emergency. Besides numerous barracks, Spandau contains various military establishments appropriate to an important garrison town; and its chief industries are connected with the preparation of munitions of war. The Government factories for the manufacture of small arms, artillery, gunpowder, &c., cover upwards of 200 acres, and employ about 4000 workmen. The other industries are not very important; they comprise miscellaneous manufactures, fishing, boat-building, and some shipping on the Havel. The population in 1885, including the garrison of nearly 4000 men, was 31,463.

Spandau is one of the oldest places in the Altmark, and received town-rights in 1232. It afterwards became a favourite residence of the Hohenzollern electors of Brandenburg, and was fortified in 1577-83. In 1635 it surrendered to the Swedes, and in 1806 to the French. A short investment in 1813 restored it to Prussia. The population in 1816 was 6250.
