SUSA, the Biblical Shushan, capital of Susiana or Elam and from the time of Darius I. the chief residence of the Achaemenian kings, was a very ancient city, which had been the centre of the old monarchy of Elam and undergone many vicissitudes before it fell into the hands of the Persians (see Elam). The site of the town, which has been fixed by the explorations of Loftus and Churchill, lies in the plain, but within sight of the mountains, between the courses of the Kerkha (Choaspes) and the Dizful, one of the affluents of the Pasitigris. The Shápúr, a small tributary of the Dizful, washes the eastern base of the ruin-mounds of Sús or Shúsh. Thus the whole district was fruitful and well watered, fit to support a great city; the surrounding rivers with their canals gave protection and a waterway to the Persian Gulf; while the position of the town between the Semitic and Iranian lands of the empire was convenient for administrative purposes. It is not therefore surprising that Susa became a vast and populous capital; Greek writers assign to it a circuit of 15 or 20 miles,—a statement which is fairly well borne out by the remains. These include three main mounds, of which one is identified with the strong citadel^[1. The Greeks called the citadel the Mε μvόvιov (Strabo, xv. 3, 2), and supposed it to have been founded by the Ethiopian Memnon. It was strong enough to withstand Molon in his war with Antiochus the Great (Polyb., v. 48). ] and a second shows the relics of the great palace built by Darius I. and completed by Artaxerxes Mnemon. Susa was still a place of importance under the Sasanians, and after having been razed to the ground in consequence of a revolt seems to have been rebuilt by Shápúr II. under the name of Éránshahr-Shápúr (Nöldeke, Gesch, d. Perser aus Tabari, p. 58). The fortifications were destroyed at the time of the Moslem conquest (Mokaddasi, p. 307); but the site, which is now deserted, was inhabited in the Middle Ages, and a seat of sugar-manufacture.

In Daniel viii. 2 the river of Shushan is called Ulai, a name which is identical with Avrai of the Bundehesh and Eulaeus of classical writers. What is told of the Eulaeus makes it impossible to identify it with the inconsiderable Shápúr; but authorities differ as to whether it is another name for the Choaspes or rather denotes the Dizful or the Pasitigris. Susa in the days of its greatness must have stretched nearly from river to river. There is a sanctuary of the tomb of Daniel on the banks of the Shápúr, and Arabic geographers relate that this tomb was a frequented shrine before the Moslem conquest and that the Arabs turned the stream over the grave.
