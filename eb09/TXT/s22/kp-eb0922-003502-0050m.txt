SIDON (Arab. Saida ) , long the principal city of Phoenicia ( q.v. ) , and even in the Middle Ages a place of importance, but now little more than a mere village, is situated on the Syrian coast in 33° 36' N. lat. and 35 20[9:22:36] 9" E. long., about midway between Sur (Tyre) and Beirut (Beyrout). The ancient city extended some 800 yards farther inland, over ground now occupied by luxuriant fruit-gardens, on the produce of which the inhabitants of the town live. In front of the flat promontory to which the modern Sidon is confined there stretches northwards and southwards a rocky peninsula; at the northern extremity of this begins a series of small rocks enclosing the harbour, which at present is a very bad one, having been, to some extent at least, purposely filled up. The port was formerly protected on the north by the Kal'at el-Bahr (“Sea Castle”), a building of the 13th century, situated upon an island still connected with the mainland by a bridge. On the south side of the town lay the so-called Egyptian harbour, now quite useless. The wall by which Sidon is at present surrounded is pierced by two gates, those of Beirut and Akko (Acre); at the south-eastern angle, upon a heap of rubbish, stand the remains of the citadel. The streets are very narrow, and the buildings of any interest are few; most prominent are some large caravanserais belonging to the period of Sidon’s modern prosperity, and the large mosque, formerly a church of the Knights of St John. Sidon looks best from the north. Of its 9000 inhabitants 7000 are Mohammedans; there are a number of institutions conducted by Catholic and Protestant Christians. In the neighbourhood are large Phoenician burial-places, which have been partially explored by Renan; the natives also engage in the search for antiquities. The principal finds are sarcophagi, and next to these sculptures and paintings. The most important discovery hitherto made has been that of the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar with a long inscription; it is now (1886) in the Louvre.

In 637-638 Sidon was taken by the Arabs. During the crusades it was alternately in possession of the Franks and the Mohammedans, but finally fell into the hands of the latter in 1291. As the residence of the Druse emir Fakhr ed-Dín, it rose to some prosperity about the beginning of the 17th century, but towards the close of the 18th its commerce again passed away, principally to Beirut (Beyrout), and the prosperity of Sidon has ever since been steadily declining.
