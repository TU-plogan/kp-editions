STOLBERG, or Stollberg, an industrial and mining town in Rhenish Prussia, is situated on the Vicht, 7 miles east of Aix-la-Chapelle. It is the centre of a very active and varied industry, exporting its produce to all parts of the world. The leading branch is metal-working, which is here carried on in important zinc, brass, and iron foundries, smelting-works of various kinds, puddling and rolling works, and manufactories of needles, pins, and other metal goods. The ore is mostly found in the mines around the town, but some is imported from a considerable distance. In or near the town there are also large chemical works, glassworks, a mirror-factory, and various minor establishments. Extensive coal-mines in the neighbourhood provide the enormous supply of fuel demanded by the various industries. The population in 1885 was 11,841.

The industrial prosperity of the town was founded in the middle of the 17th century by French religious refugees, who introduced the art of brass-founding. An ancient castle in the town is popularly believed to have been a hunting-lodge of Charlemagne.
