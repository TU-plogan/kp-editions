SWALLOW (A.-S. Swalewe, Icel. Scala, Dutch Zwaluw, Germ. Schwalbe), the bird which of all others is recognized as the harbinger of summer in the northern hemisphere; for, though some slight differences, varying according, to the meridian, are constantly presented by the birds which have their home in Europe, in northern Asia, and in North America respectively, it is difficult to allow to them a specific value; and consequently a zoologist of wide views,[9:22:730] while not overlooking this local variation, will regard the Swallow of all these tracts as forming a single species, the Hirundo rustica of Linnaeus.^[1. Dr Stejneger (one of the chief leaders in the recent American movement, the results though not the intention of which would be the subversion of much of the nomenclature of birds hitherto thought in Europe to have been established on tolerably firm principles) would apply to the Swallow the generic term of Chelidon, generally accepted for the Martin (vol. xv. p. 581), and to the latter Ηirundo. Herein he is technically incorrect, for one of the first principles of zoological nomenclature has always been that a generic term, to be valid, must be defined. In the absence of definition such a term may be, by courtesy, occasionally accepted; but this courtesy has never been, nor except in America is likely to be, extended to the misapplication here in question. ] Returning, usually already paired, to its summer-haunts, after its winter-sojourn in southern lands, and generally reaching England about the first week in April, it at once repairs to its old quarters, nearly always around the abodes of men; and, about a month later, the site of the nest is chosen, resort being had in most cases to the very spot that has formerly served the same purpose—the old structure, if still remaining, being restored and refurnished. So trustful is the bird that it commonly establishes itself in any of men’s works that will supply the necessary accommodation, and a shed, a barn, or any building with an open roof, a chimney^[2. Hence the common English name of “Chimney-Swallow.” In North America it is usually the “Barn-Swallow.” ] that affords a support for the nest, or even the room of an inhabited house—if chance should give free access thereto, —to say nothing of extraordinary positions, may be the place of its choice. Wheresoever placed, the nest is formed of small lumps of moist earth, which, carried to the spot in the bird’s bill, are duly arranged and modelled, with the aid of short straws or slender sticks, into the required shape. This is generally that of a half-saucer, but it varies according to the exigencies of the site. The materials dry quickly into a hard crust, which is lined with soft feathers, and therein are laid from four to six white eggs, blotched and speckled with grey and orange-brown deepening into black. Two broods are usually reared in the season, and the young on leaving the nest soon make their way to some leafless bough, whence they try their powers of flight, at first accompanying their parents in short excursions on the wing, receiving from them the food themselves are as yet unable to capture, until able to shift for themselves. They collect in flocks, often of many hundreds, and finally leave the country about the end of August or early in September, to be followed, after a few weeks, by their progenitors. The Swallows of Europe doubtless pass into Africa far beyond the equator,^[3. It must be noted that the Swallow has been observed in England in every month of the year; but its presence from the beginning of December to the middle of March is an extremely rare occurrence. ] and those of Northern Asia, though many stop in India or Burmah, even further to the southward, occasionally reaching Australia, while those of North America extend their winter-wanderings to southern Brazil; but, whithersoever they then resort, they during that season moult their feathers, and this fact affords one of the strongest arguments against the popular belief (which, curious to say, is still partly if not fully entertained by many who should know better) of their becoming torpid in winter, for a state of torpidity would suspend all animal action.^[4. See John Hunter’s Essays and Observations in Natural History, edited by Sir R. Owen in 1861 (ii. p. 280). An excellent bibliography of the Swallow-torpidity controversy, up to 1878, is given by Prof. Coues (Birds of the Colorado Valley, pp. 378-390), who seems still to hanker after the ancient faith in “hibernation.” ] The chestnut forehead and throat, the shining steel-blue upper plumage, and the dusky-white—in some cases reddening so as almost to vie with the frontal and gular patches—of the lower parts are well known to every person of observation, as is the markedly forked tail, which is become proverbial of this bird.

Taking the word Swallow in a more extended sense, it is used for all the members of the Family Himndinidae, ^[5. An enormous amount of labour has been bestowed upon the Hirundinidae by Mr Sharpe (Cat. B. Br. Museum, x. pp. 85-210), only commensurate, perhaps, with that required for an understanding of the results at which he has arrived. Nothing can better shew the difficulty of unravelling the many puzzles which the Family offers than this; and it is to be hoped that in his finely-illustrated Monograph which is now in course of publication he will succeed in clearing up some of them. ] excepting a few to which the name Martin (vol. xv. p. 581) has been applied, and this Family includes from 80 to 100 species, which have been placed in many different genera. The true Swallow has very many affines, some of which range almost as widely as itself docs, while others seem to have curiously restricted limits, and much the same may be said of several of its more distant relatives. But altogether the Family forms one of the most circumscribed and therefore one of the most natural groups of Oscines, having no near allies; for, though in outward appearance and in some habits the Swallows bear a considerable resemblance to Swifts (q. v. ), the latter belong to a very different Order, and are not Passerine birds at all, as their structure, both internal and external, proves. It has been sometimes stated that the Hirundinidae have their nearest relations in the Flycatchers (vol. ix. p. 351); but the assertion is very questionable, and the supposition that they are allied to the Ampelidae (cf . Waxwing), though possibly better founded, has not as yet been confirmed by any anatomical investigation. An affinity to the Indian and Australian Artamus (the species of which genus are often known as Wood-Swallows, or Swallow-Shrikes) has also been suggested; and it may turn out that this genus, with its neighbours, may be the direct and less modified descendants of a generalized type, whence the Hirundinidae have diverged; but at present it would seem as if the suggestion originated only in the similarity of certain habits, such as swift flight and the capacity of uninterruptedly taking and swallowing insect-food on the wing.

Swallows are nearly cosmopolitan birds, inhabiting every considerable country except New Zealand, wherein only a stray example, presumably from Australia, occasionally occurs. (a. n.)
