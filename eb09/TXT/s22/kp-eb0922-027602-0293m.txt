SORIA, a province of Spain, in Old Castile, bounded on the N. by Logro√±o, E. by Saragossa, S. by Guadalajara, and W. by Segovia and Burgos; the area is 3836 square miles. It is a bleak and lofty region, being bounded on three sides by mountains. A range of low sierras on the north, and the great Sierra de Moncayo on the east, separate the valley of the Duero (Douro) from that of the Ebro, while on the south it is divided from that of the Tagus by a continuation of the Sierra Guadarrama. The whole of the province belongs to the region watered by the Duero and its affluents. This river rises in the northern mountains, and traverses the province in a circuitous course, first to the south and then to the west. The other rivers are mostly affluents of the Duero, such as the Tuerto, San Pedro, &c.; but a few of the tributaries of the Ebro have their sources within the limits of the province. The soil is not remarkable for fertility; on the contrary, a large proportion of the area is occupied with barren mountains, which are covered with snow for a great part of the year. There are, however, in some places extensive forests of pine, oak, and beech; while in others there are large tracts of pasture land, on which numbers of cattle, sheep, and swine are reared. Grain and vegetables are raised, but neither of very good quality nor in sufficient quantities to supply the wants of the population. The climate is cold and dry, and the scenery grand, but not very pleasing in its character. Most of the people are employed in farming and rearing cattle; but the cutting and sawing of timber and the preparation of charcoal also occupy a considerable number. There is a great want of roads in this part of the country; and commerce is consequently very limited. Fine wool was formerly an important production of the province; but of late years it has considerably fallen off. The only important article of trade at present is timber, which is sent to Madrid and Aragon. Soria is divided into five partidos judiciales and 345 ayuntamientos. The population was returned in 1877 as 153,654. There is a bishop (suffragan of Burgos), resident at Osma. The only town of more than 5000 inhabitants is Soria.
