STRANRAER, a royal burgh of Wigtownshire, Scotland, is situated on the North Channel, at the head of Loch Ryan, 7Â½ miles north-east of Portpatrick, and 59 miles south-south-west of Ayr. In the centre of the town is the old baronial castle of the 15th century occupied by Claverhouse when he held the office of sheriff of Galloway. The principal public buildings are the old town-hall, the new town-hall and court-house (1873), and the academy (1845). A reformatory provides accommodation for 100 boys, and there is a combination poorhouse for the county and a few parishes beyond it. The town possesses a library and public reading-room. The harbour, which is tidal, only admits the entrance of vessels of 150 tons, but there is good anchorage in the loch, and the east pier permits of the approach of large steamers, which ply in connexion with the railway daily to Larne in Ireland. There is also steam communication with Glasgow, Liverpool, and other towns; but since the construction of the Girvan and Portpatrick Railway the trade of the port has been on the decline. The principal import is coal, and the principal exports are agricultural produce. The town is chiefly dependent on agriculture. The fishing industry is of minor importance. The population in 1881 of the royal burgh (area 55 acres) was 3455, and of the police burgh 6342. The town was created a burgh of barony in 1596, and a royal burgh in 1617. In 1885 its parliamentary representation (it had been one of the Wigtown burghs) was merged in that of the county.
