SPERMACETI is a solid waxy body found in special cavities in the head of the sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus), where it is held in solution by sperm oil while the creature is in life. At a temperature of about 6° C. the solid matter separates in a crystalline condition, and when purified by pressure and treatment with weak solution of caustic alkali it forms brilliant white crystalline scales or plates, hard but unctuous to the touch, and destitute of taste or smell. It is quite insoluble in water, very slightly affected by boiling alcohol, but easily dissolved in ether, chloroform, and carbon bisulphide. Spermaceti consists principally of cetin or cetyl palmitate, { θ>

—an ether composed of cetyl alcohol combined with palmitic acid. Spermaceti candles of definite size are employed[9:22:396] as a standard for illuminants on account of the uniform steady light they afford. The substance is further used in the dressing of fabrics and in medicine and surgery, especially in cerates, bougies, ointments, and in cosmetic preparations. For sperm oil, see Whale Oils.
