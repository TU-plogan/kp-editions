STAFFORD, a parliamentary and municipal borough of England, and the county town of Staffordshire, is situated on the left bank of the river Sow, almost in the heart of England. It is 123 miles from London and 29 ¼ from Birmingham, and is in the southern division of the hundred of Pirehill. The principal trades of the town are tanning and the manufacture of boots and shoes, more especially for ladies. The oldest church is that of St Chad, said to be originally of Saxon origin. It was formerly a large and beautiful church, with chancel, nave, aisles, transepts, and a central tower, but has suffered severely from time, neglect, and rough treatment. Restoration was begun in 1855, and the operations led to the discovery of some fine interlacing Norman arches and a beautiful Norman archway with some rich sculptured work between the nave and tower. These were restored in 1856 and a new roof was put on the chancel in memory of Izaak Walton. In 1874, the nave, arcades, and open-timbered roof were restored in memory of Mr Thomas Salt; in 1874-75 the south aisle was rebuilt, and in 1884-85 the tower. The finest of the churches in Stafford is undoubtedly St Mary’s, which was admirably restored in 1844-45 by Sir Gilbert Scott, at a cost of £30,000. It contains some good monuments, and several very fine memorial windows of stained glass. Other churches worthy of mention are Christ Church, St Paul’s, and St Thomas’s. The grammar school is a very old foundation, enlarged by Edward VI.; the present building was erected in 1862. The free library was opened in 1882, and is now fairly well supplied with books. The William Salt library contains a unique collection of books, deeds, autographs, engravings, and drawings relating to the county, collected by Mr Salt and presented by his widow. It contains some 7000 volumes, between 2000 and 3000 deeds, and more than 9000 drawings, autographs, and valuable MSS., mostly relating to the history, topography, Ac., of the county. The town also possesses a good museum, collected principally by Mr Clement L. Wragge, and called by his name; specially interesting is its almost perfect collection of fossils. Stafford also contains a good school of art and a mechanics’ institute. Other prominent buildings are the shire hall, in which the assizes and quarter sessions are held, and the borough hall; the latter contains the municipal offices, and also has a large hall for public meetings. Stafford is well supplied with charitable institutions, among which may be mentioned the general infirmary, built in 1766; the county lunatic asylum in 1818; and the Coton Hill institution for the insane in 1854, beautifully situated on rising ground, which commands extensive views of some of the loveliest country in the county, while its own grounds are tastefully laid out. The householders of Stafford formerly possessed the right of using some very extensive common land situated north of the town; in 1880, however, all that remained (134 acres) was enclosed, and is now held for the people by a committee of householders elected annually. A part of this land, called Stone Flat, is preserved as a public recreation ground. Of another common named Coton Field, consisting of about 180 acres, 70 acres were in 1884 transferred absolutely to the freemen, and have been divided into 401 garden allotments, which are let at a small rental to resident freemen or their widows. The parliamentary borough (area 774 acres, with population of 18,904 in 1881) was extended in 1885, and is now identical with the municipal borough. The area of this is 1012 acres, and the population, 14,437 in 1871, was in 1881 19,977. The Act of 1885 reduced the parliamentary representation from two members to one.

Stafford was of considerable importance before the Conquest. The site was at first known as Berteliney or Betheney, from the island on which the earliest houses were built. As the town grew its name was changed into that of Stafford or Stadford. In 913 Ethelfleda, sister of Edward the Elder, erected a fortification here, generally called a castle, but doubtless one of those defensive mounds which from their admirable positions were afterwards selected by the Normans as the sites of their castles and strongholds. About a year and a half afterwards Edward the Elder built a tower, with walls and a fosse round it. Pennant says this was on the mount called Castle Hill by Speed. Stafford is mentioned in Domesday as a city paying £9 in customs. 1 here were 18 royal burgesses, and the earls of Mercia possessed twenty mansions. The number of houses entered is 178. William built a castle on the old site, of which he appointed Robert de lorn[9:22:444] governor, who took the name De Stafford from that of the town, aud was the originator of the great family of the Staffords. At this time it contained a royal mint; some of the coins are still extant, hearing on the obverse the head and name of the king, and on the reverse “Godwinne on Staef.” Godwinne was the "king’s moneyer.” The castle of Robert de Torri was rebuilt by Ralph de Stafford in the reign of Edward III.; during the Civil War it was held for the Royalists by the earl of Northampton, but was taken for the Parliament by Sir William Brereton in May 1643. The castle was soon afterwards demolished by order of the Parliament. When fortified, Stafford had four gates. That on the south, near the river bridge, called the Green-gate, was taken down in 1780. The arch of the East-gate was standing a few years ago. The Gaol-gate was in ruins in 1680. The site of the fourth gate is unknown. King John confirmed and enlarged the privileges granted by the old charter. This was again confirmed by Edward VI., and on August 6, 1575, Elizabeth visited the town. Stafford adopted the Local Government Act, 1858, on April 23, 1872; and in 1876 an Act was obtained for extending the borough boundaries. The corporation now consists of a mayor, eight aldermen, and twenty-four councillors.
