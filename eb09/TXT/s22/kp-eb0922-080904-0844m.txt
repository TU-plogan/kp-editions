SYLHET, a British district of India, in the province of Assam, lying between 25° 12' and 23° 59' N. lat. and 91° and 92° 38' E. long., with an area of 5381 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by the Kliási and Jaintia Hills district, on the E. by Cachar, on the S. by the state of Hill Tipperah and the district of Tipperah, and on the W. by the district of Maimansinh. Sylhet consists of the lower valley of the Surma or Barak river, and for the most part is a uniform level, broken only by scattered clusters of sandy hillocks called tilas, and intersected by a network of rivers and drainage channels. In the south eight low ranges of hills, spurs of the Tipperah Mountains, run out into the plain, the highest range being about 1500 feet above sea-level. There is also a small detached group in the centre of the district called the Ita Hills. Entering the district from Cachar, the Surma bifurcates into two branches: the main branch flows beneath the hills bordering the north-east part, while the minor branch, the Kusiára, flows in a south-westerly direction across the district; they again unite on the south-western boundary and fall into the Meghna under the name of Dhaleswari. Both branches are navigable by large boats and support a busy traffic. The wild animals of the district comprise elephants, tigers, buffaloes, bison, and several varieties of deer. The climate of Sylhet is extremely damp and the rainfall is heavy, reaching an annual average of over 150 inches; the rainy season generally lasts from April to October.[9:22:810] In 1881 the population was returned at 1,969,009, of whom 999,785 were males and 969,224 females. Hindus numbered 949,353, Mohammedans 1,015,531, and hill tribes 3708. The only places with a population exceeding 5000 are Sylhet town (14,407) and Kashba Baniachang, a large village (24,061). Sylhet town, the administrative headquarters of the district, is situated on the right or north bank of the Surma, and besides the usual public offices contains a handsome church and the mosque of Sháh Jalál (a fakir whose miraculous powers contributed greatly to the Mussulman conquest of the country), which attracts pilgrims from great distances. Out of the total area 3080 square miles were returned as under cultivation in 1882-83 and 654 as cultivable. The staple crop is rice, which yields three harvests during the year. There are immense forest tracts in the south-eastern parts of Sylhet. The chief industries are the weaving by Manipuri women of cotton cloths called Manipuri khesh, also handkerchiefs and mosquito curtains tastefully embroidered with silk. The manufacture of mats, ivory and shell carving, and other ornamental work are also pursued with much skill and elegance.

Sylhet with the rest of Bengal passed into the hands of the British in 1765. Previous to 1874 Sylhet formed an integral part of Bengal, being included in the Dacca division; but in September of that year it was annexed, together with the adjoining district of Cachar, to the chief-commissionership of Assam.
