SOLDER is a metallic alloy or metal employed for cementing or binding together two metallic surfaces. The solder is applied to the surfaces to be united in a molten state, and it is therefore generally either a more fusible body than the metal to be acted on or it is presented in a more fusible condition. The process of autogenous soldering consists in uniting the individual metallic edges themselves by melting and fusing them in the heat of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe or by means of an ignited blast of mixed coal gas and air. Autogenous soldering is extensively used in connexion with large plumber work. Ordinary solders are divided into hard and soft classes, the hard comprising such as require a red heat for their melting. The soft solders used by plumbers and tinsmiths consist of variable mixtures of lead and tin, and for pewterersâ€™ use bismuth is added to these. The hardest brazing solder has equal parts of copper and zinc, and for softer qualities increased amounts of zinc with tin and sometimes antimony are employed. For fine jewellery alloys of gold, silver, and copper are used; silver solder is employed for inferior qualities, and even common soft solder finds extensive employment in the jewellery trade. Silver is the proper solder for German silver manufactures also; and gold is the medium for joining the edges of platinum vessels. In soldering, the metallic edges to be united must be free from oxidation and dirt; and to keep them unoxidized during the operation several fluxes are used, such as borax in brass soldering, rosin and solution of zinc chloride for tin-plate, zinc chloride for zinc, rosin and tallow for lead and tin, and olive oil in pewter work. Special machinery has been devised for the soldering of the tinned cases now so extensively employed in the preserved food trade. In common soft soldering the solder is melted and applied to the joint by a heated iron or copper soldering bolt, but solders are also applied by being melted on in the open fire, or in the muffle furnace, by immersing the joint in a bath of molten solder, or by pouring the molten material on the joint. In dealing with hard solders the heat of the blowpipe flame is used.
