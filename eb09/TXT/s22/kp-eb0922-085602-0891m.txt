SZABADKA (German, Maria-Theresiopel), a royal free town of Hungary, in the county of B훮cs, on Lake Palics, in 46째 8' N. lat. and 19째 42' E. long. It is the centre of an immense agricultural district and has little claim to special distinction. There are a chamber of advocates, an upper gymnasium, a state training institute for governesses, and an industrial and commercial school. The population (61,367 in 1880) was about 63,500 in 1885, mostly Hungarians, but partly Bunyev훮czs (a branch of Servians).
