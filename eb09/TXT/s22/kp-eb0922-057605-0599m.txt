STONINGTON, a borough and seaport of the United States, in New London county, Connecticut, is situated on Long Island Sound, 139 miles from New York by the railway to Providence and Boston. It is built on a narrow rocky point, and is a quiet quaint-looking town, largely frequented as a summer watering-place. Its industries comprise silk-throwing and the manufacture of silk machinery, and it has a considerable interest in sealing. Here and there may still be seen traces of the bombardment by the British under Sir Thomas Hardy in August 1814. The harbour is protected by two breakwaters; it is the terminus of a daily line of steamers from New York. The population of the township was 6313 in 1870, and 7355 in 1880. Settled in 1649, the borough was incorporated in 1801.
