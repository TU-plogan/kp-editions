SURREY, Henry Howard, Earl of (1516?-1547), one of the leaders in the poetic movement under Henry VIIT. that heralded the great outburst of the Elizabethan period. Of his personal life outside his poetry only the barest outline is known, and till comparatively of late even that outline was not free from confusion. Three different men— the grandfather of the poet, his father, and the poet himself—bore the title within a period of ten or eleven years; and at one time the poet was confounded with his grandfather, and supposed to have been present at the battle of Flodden (1513). He was not born till at least two years after that event. It was his grandfather who distinguished himself at Flodden under the title of the earl of Surrey, and was created duke of Norfolk as a reward for his services, surrendering the title of Surrey to his son, the poet’s father, for his lifetime. Although the poet has always been most familiarly known as the earl of Surrey, he really held the title only by courtesy, succeeding to it on that footing in 1524, when his father became duke of Norfolk. In one of his poems he speaks of having passed “his childish years” at Windsor “with a king’s son.” This was Henry VIII.’s natural son, Henry Fitzroy, duke of Richmond, who was affianced to Surrey’s sister, Mary, but died before he was out of his teens. It is[9:22:695] sometimes said that the two were educated together at Windsor; but the sweet companionship to which the poem refers, when the two youths “hoved” in the large green courts “with eyes cast up into the maiden’s tower,” belongs to the last year of Fitzroy’s short life. Whether or not Surrey was educated from literal childhood with a king’s son, he was certainly educated with the care for literary culture which about that time became common in the households of English noblemen; and, as the fashion was, he was sent, after passing through Cambridge, to complete his education in Italy. The tradition that he made the tour of Europe as a knight-errant, upholding against all comers the superiority of his mistress Geraldine, has no extrinsic evidence in its favour. If Geraldine was, as is commonly supposed, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, a daughter of the earl of Kildare, she was but a child of seven or eight years when Surrey set out on his travels. The legend about his knight-errantry is probably only a sign of the extent to which his chivalrous personality and poetry fascinated the imagination of his own and the next generation. The eminence of the Howards at Henry’s court was evidenced in many ways: in the festivities at the king’s marriage with Anne of Cleves, Surrey was the leader of one of the sides at the tournament, and two years later his cousin, Catherine Howard, became the king’s fifth wife. Surrey took an active part in the insignificant wars of Henry’s later years, accompanied the expedition, led by his father, which ravaged the south of Scotland in 1542, and held a command in the French expedition of 1544. When the king’s death was known to be near, the duke of Norfolk was suspected of aiming at the throne, and Surrey’s own haughty and ostentatious manners countenanced the suspicion. A month before the king’s death both were arrested and lodged in the Tower, and on 13th January 1547 Surrey was brought to trial for high treason. The main charge against him was that he had “falsely, maliciously, and treacherously set up and borne the arms of Edward the Confessor.” His plea that the arms belonged to his ancestors was probably not accepted as an extenua tion of the offence. A common jury found him guilty, and he was executed on Tower Hill on 19th January.

His poems, which had been one of the occupations of his crowded life, first appeared in print in Tottel's Miscellany in 1557. On the title-page of this memorable publication Surrey’s name stood first, but this was probably in deference to his rank; Wyatt was the first in point of time of Henry’s “courtly makers” (see Wyatt). Surrey,. indeed, expressly acknowledges λVyatt, who was several years his senior, as his master in poetry. Seeing, however, that their poems were first published in the same volume, many years after the death of both, their names can never be disassociated, and it must always be hard to say which was the leader in the various new and beautiful forms of verse which Toltel's Miscellany introduced into English poetry. Surrey’s only unquestionable distinction as a metrician lies outside the Miscellany : his translation of the second and fourth books of the Aeneid into blank verse — the first attempt at blank verse in English—was published separately by Tottel in the same year. But his sonnets (in various schemes of verse), his elegy on the death of Wyatt (in elegiac staves shut in by a final couplet), his pastoral poem (a lover’s complaint put into the mouth of a shepherd), and his lyrics in livelier measures are all extremely interesting experiments, and served as models for more than one generation of courtly singers and sonneteers. In form as well as in substance Surrey and his compeers were largely indebted to Italian predecessors; most of his poems are in fact translations or adaptations of Italian originals. The tone of the love sentiment was new in English poetry, very different in its earnestness, passion, and fantastic extravagance from the lightness, gaiety, and humour of the Chaucerian school. In this respect Tottel’s Miscellany helped to educate the English muse for the triumphs of the tragic drama. Surrey’s own contributions are distinguished by their copious and impetuous eloquence and sweetness.
