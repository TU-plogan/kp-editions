SPINOLA, Ambrogio Spinola, Marchese di ( c . 1571- 1630), a celebrated general, belonged to a noble and wealthy Italian family, and was born at Genoa about 1571. After the siege of Ostend had languished for more than two years under the direction of the archduke Albert, Spinola, who, though not a soldier by profession, had seen something of campaigning during a season or two, came upon the scene as a condottiere and received charge of the works. He entered upon his task in October 1603, and his courage and vigour were rewarded by the surrender of the place on 20th September 1604. During the next five years, until the conclusion of the armistice of 1609, he frequently encountered Maurice of Orange, but on the whole with undecisive results. In 1620 he was sent by Spain into the Palatinate of the Rhine, and took many places; in the following year, on the renewal of the war with Holland, he returned to the scenes of his earlier campaigns, where his principal exploits were the capture of Jülich in February 1622 and of Breda after a ten months’ siege in June 1625. His health now began to give way; and his spirits are said to have been further depressed by Philip’s disregard of his pecuniary claims. He died at Castel-Nuovo di Scrivia on 25th September 1630.
