SMITH, William Henry (1808-1872), best known as the author of Thorndale, is one of those thinkers and students whose work, whilst scarcely recognized in their own day and soon all but overlooked in the larger perspective of history, is yet of real value for an appreciation of the intellectual character of the time. The literary production of which Thorndale is the most representative example affords a moral countenance to contemporary workers in philosophy which is invaluable, but which for obvious reasons can never be exactly appraised. With a fine and reflective, rather than robust and active, intelligence, Smith deals suggestively in the form of conversation—which he adopts in Thorndale and in his later book Gravenhurst— with the problem of good and evil, with materialism and idealism, with most of the subtle modern perplexities in the interaction of religion, philosophy, and science. But his more exact contributions to thought, such as the Discourse on the Ethics of the School of Paley and the Essays on Knowing and Feeling, do not work out anything like a complete system, and are somewhat lacking in intellectual grip. Smith also wrote several books of verse and two plays, one of which, Athelwold, was produced by Macready in 1812. Much graceful reflexion and a true feeling for nature are found in his verse, but it lacks energy. Smith spent a serene uneventful life, chiefly in the studious seclusion which he loved, but which must have tended to foster the inactive tendencies that led him to call himself playfully in his latter days “the snail.” He was born at Hammersmith in 1808 in comfortable surroundings, his father being a retired merchant; his mother was of German extraction, with a vein of mysticism, which is worth noticing in view of the son’s metaphysical tendencies. He was sent in 1821 to Glasgow, where Byron’s poetry and Scottish metaphysics seem to have had most influence upon him. Then he entered a lawyer’s office, in which he remained for five years. His first writings appeared in the Literary Gazette and in the Athenaeum, to which he contributed under the name of “Wool-gatherer,” attracting some attention by the delicacy and finish of his style. His ambition was at the outset chiefly poetical, however, and, when his first book appeared and was almost completely ignored, he dug a grave and buried the unsold copies in a fit of Byronic despondency. Ernesto, a philosophical romance, also belongs to this early period. In 1836 he wrote for the Quarterly Review, and in 1839 he formed a connexion with Blackwoods Magazine, which lasted for thirty years, during the latter part of which he acted as its philosophical critic. In 1846 a visit to Italy led to the writing of a tale entitled Mildred, which was too purely reflective to be successful. In 1851 he declined the chair of moral philosophy at Edinburgh, having determined a year or two previously to retire to the English Lake district, there to study in seclusion. There he completed Thorndale, which was published in 1857. Gravenhurst appeared in 1862; a second edition contained a memoir of the author by his wife. He died at Brighton on 28th March 1872.
