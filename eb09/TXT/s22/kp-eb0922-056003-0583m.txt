STOCKS, as a form of punishment, are now quite obsolete. They were originally established in England after the passing of the Statute of Labourers, 23 Edw. III. c. 1. That Act enjoined that stocks (ceppes) should be made in every town between the passing of the Act and Pentecost of that year (1350). By numerous other statutes, until comparatively modern times, the punishment of the stocks was inflicted for offences of a less heinous kind, e.g., breaches of the Sunday Observance Acts of Charles I. and Charles II. In the United States the stocks were formerly used as a means of punishing slaves.
