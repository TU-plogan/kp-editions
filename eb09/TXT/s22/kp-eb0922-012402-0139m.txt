SKIPTON, an ancient market-town in the West Riding of Yorkshire, is situated on the river Aire, on the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and on the Midland Railway, 9 miles north-west of Keighley and 15 south-east of Settle. It is substantially built of stone. The strong castle built by Robert de Romille in the time of the Conqueror was partly demolished in 1649, but was restored by the countess of Pembroke. Of the ancient building of De Romille all that now remains is the western doorway of the inner castle. In the castle grounds are the ruins of the ancient parish church of St John. The church of the Holy Trinity, in the Decorated Gothic, was also partly demolished during the Civil War, but was restored by the countess of Pembroke, and again underwent renovation in 1854. The free grammar school was founded in 1548 by William Ermysted, a canon of St Paulâ€™s, London. The town has a considerable general trade. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 4245 acres) in 1871 was 6078 and in 1881 it was 9091.

Skipton was the capital of the ancient district of Craven. At the Norman accession it became part of the possessions of Earl Edwin, and was granted to Robert de Romille, who built the castle about the end of the reign of William. Subsequently it went to[9:22:125] the Albemarle family, but was again vested in the crown, and Edward II. bestowed it on Piers de Gaveston. In 1311 it came into the possession of the Cliffords. The castle was taken by the Parliamentary forces in 1645 and demolished in 1649.
