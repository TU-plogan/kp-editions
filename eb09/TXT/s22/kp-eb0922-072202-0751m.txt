SUSA, a city of Italy, in the province of Turin, 33½ miles west of Turin by the railway which passes by the Mont Cenis tunnel into France, is situated on the Dora Riparia (tributary of the Po) at 1625 feet above the sea, and is so protected from the northern winds by the Rocciamelone that it enjoys a milder winter climate than Turin itself. The city walls, 20 to 30 feet broad at the base, were about 50 feet in height, but in 1789 their ruinous condition caused them to be reduced by about half their elevation. Numerous remains of Roman buildings and works of art still show the importance of the ancient town; and the triumphal arch erected by Cottius in honour of Augustus still stands on the old Roman road between Italy and Gaul,—a noble structure, 45 feet high, 39 broad, and 23 deep. The inscription, now illegible, mentioned fourteen “civitates” subject to Cottius. Among the modern buildings of Susa the first place belongs to the church of San Giusto, founded in 1029 by Olderico Manfredi II. and the countess Berta, and in 1772 raised to be the cathedral. The population of the city was 3254 in 1871 and 3305 in 1881 (commune, 4418).

Segusio (also Secusio, Siosium, Seutium, Seucia, &c.) was at a very early period the chief town of this Alpine region, and the Cottian Alps themselves preserve the name of the Segusian chief Cottius, who with the title of praefectus became a tributary and ally of Rome in the reign of Augustus, and left his state strong enough to maintain its independence till the reign of Nero. As a Roman municipium and military post Segusio continued to flourish. After the time of Charlemagne a marquisate of Susa was established; and the town became in the 11th century the capital of the famous countess Adelaide, who was mistress of the whole of Piedmont. On his retreat from Legnano, Barbarossa set fire to Susa; but the town became more than ever important when Emanuel Philibert fortified it at great expense in the 16th century.
