SIROHI, or Seeboee, a native state in the Rájputána agency under the Government of India, with an area of 3020 square miles, lying between 24° 20' and 25° 20' N. lat. and between 72° 10' and 73° 10' E. long., and bounded on the W. and N. by Márwár or Jodhpur, on the E. by Mewár or Udáipur, on the S. by Pálanpur and the Mahi Kántha states of Edar and Dánta. The country is much broken up by hills and rocky ranges; the Aravalli range divides it into two portions, running from north-east to south-west. The south and south-east part of the territory is very mountainous and rugged, containing the lofty Mount Abu, an isolated mass of granite rock, culminating in a cluster of hills, enclosing several valleys surrounded by rocky ridges, like great hollows. The highest peak rises to 5653 feet above sea-level, and is one of the great trigonometrical stations. On both sides of the Aravallis the country is intersected with numerous water channels, which run with considerable force and volume during the height of the rainy season, but are dry for the greater part of the year. The only river of any importance is the Western Banás. A large portion of the state is covered with dense jungle, in which wild animals, including the tiger, bear, and leopard, abound. Many splendid ruins bear witness to the former prosperity and civilization of the state. The climate is on the whole dry; in the south and east there is usually a fair amount of rain. On Abu the average annual rainfall is about 64 inches, whereas in Erinpura, less than 50 miles to the north, the average fall is only between 12 and 13 inches. The Western Rájputána Railway runs through the length of the state, passing just east of Mount Abu.

In 1881 the population numbered 142,903 (males 76,132, females 66,771), of whom 123,633 were Hindus, 2935 were Mohammedans, and 16,137 were Jains. The town of Sirohi, the capital of the state, is situated at the western base of the range of hills north of Mount Abu, and its population (1881) numbered 5699. Wheat and barley are the staple crops; pulses and cotton are also grown. The present ruling family of Sirohi are Deora Rajputs, a branch of the great Chauhán clan, and are said to be immediately descended from Deo Raj, a descendant of Pirthvi Raj, the Chauhán king of Delhi. During the early years of the present century Sirohi suffered much from wars with Jodhpur and the wild Mina hill tribes. The protection of the British was sought in 1817; the pretensions of Jodhpur to suzerainty over Sirohi were disallowed, and in 1823 a treaty was concluded with the British Government. For services rendered during the mutiny of 1857 the reigning “rao” received a remission of half his tribute.
