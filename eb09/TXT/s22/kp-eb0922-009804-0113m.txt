SÍRSA, a British district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, lying between 29° 13' and 30° 40' N. lat. and between 73° 57' and 75° 23' E. long. It has an area of 3008 square miles, and is bounded on the N. by Firozpur district and the native state of Patiála, on the W. by the river Sutlej, on the S.W. by the native states of Baháwalpur and Bikaner, and on the E. by Hissar district. Lying as it does between the barren deserts of Bikaner and the comparatively fertile though sandy plains of the Cis-Sutlej states, Sírsa district in soil as well as position forms an intermediate link between the two. It forms for the most part a bare and treeless plateau stretching from the valley of the little river Ghaggar on the east to the main stream of the Sutlej on its western border. In the immediate neighbourhood of the Sutlej, however, is a fertile alluvial tract (khádar), intersected by numerous branches of the river, and flooded by their outflow during the rainy season. Eastward of the khádar lies the sandy central tableland, which is chiefly employed for purposes of pasturage. East of this plateau is the valley of the Ghaggar, a formidable torrent in the rainy months, but so entirely dependent on the rainfall of the lower Himalayas that it is usually dry from October to July. The Ghaggar expands into three jhils or marshy lakes, the largest of which is 5 miles in length by 2 in breadth. South of the Ghaggar spreads a sandy tract beyond the reach of its fertilizing influence, and of small agricultural value. Formerly the district was covered by an excellent grazing grass, known as dháman, but with the increase of cultivation it is fast disappearing. The climate of Sírsa is extremely dry, the average annual rainfall reaching only 15 inches. The Rewari-Ferozcpore Railway passes through the district from south to north.

The population of the district, according to the census of 1881, was 253,275 (males 138,691, females 114,584), of whom 130,582 were Hindus, 93,289 Mohammedans, and 28,303 Sikhs. The only town with a population exceeding 10,000 is Sírsa, the administrative headquarters of the district, with 12,292 inhabitants. The modern town of Sírsa was founded in 1837, and the ruins of old Sírsa lie near its south-west corner. It is a considerable entrepôt for the trade of the wheat-growing countries to the north and east with Bikaner and Márwár. At the opening of the present century nearly the whole of Sírsa district was a barren almost uncultivated waste. Gradually, however, with more peaceful times[9:22:99] cultivation has again extended. Of the total area 1353 square miles are now cultivated and 1548 square miles are cultivable. The staple product is bajra, which in 1882-83 occupied 546,905 acres; the other principal crops are joar, barley, and wheat. The district has little trade except in agricultural produce, which goes chiefly to Bikaner; and the only manufacture of any importance is that of sajji, an impure carbonate of soda, used in washing and dyeing cloth. Sírsa was officially included in the territory conquered from the Mahrattas in 1803, when it was almost entirely uninhabited. It required reconquering from the Bhattis in 1818; but it did not come under British administration until 1837. During the mutiny of 1857 Sírsa was for a time wholly lost to British rule. On the restoration of order the district was administered by Punjab officials, and in the following year, with the remainder of the Delhi territory, it was formally annexed to that province.
