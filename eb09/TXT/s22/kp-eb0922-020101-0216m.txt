SNORRO STURLUSON (Snorri, son of Stnrla) (1179- 1241), the celebrated Icelandic historian, born in 1179, the youngest son of a chief in the Vestfir‎ðir (western fiords), was brought up by a powerful chief, Jon Loptsson, in Odda, who seems first to have awakened in him an interest for history and poetry. His career begins with his marriage, which made him a wealthy man; in 1206 he settled at Reykjaholt, where he constructed magnificent buildings and a bath of hewn stones, preserved to the present day, to which water was conducted from a neighbouring hot spring. He early made himself known as a poet, especially by glorifying the exploits of the contemporary Norse kings and earls; at the same time he was a learned lawyer, and from 1215 became the “lögsögumaör,” or president of the legislative assembly and supreme court of Iceland. The prominent features of his character seem to have been cunning, ambition, and avarice, combined with want of courage and aversion to effort. By royal invitation he went in 1218 to Norway, where he remained a long time with the young king Hakon and his tutor Earl Skuli. When, owing to disputes between Icelandic and Norwegian merchants, Skuli thought of a military expedition to Iceland, Snorro persuaded him to give up this plan, promising to make the inhabitants submit to Hakon of their own free will. Snorro himself became the “lendrmaör,” vassal or baron, of the king of Norway, and held his lands as a fief under him. On his return home Snorro sent his son to the king as a hostage, and made peace between Norway and Iceland, but his power and influence were used more for his own enrichment and aggrandizement—he was “lögsögumaðr” again from 1222 to 1232—than for the advantage of the king. Hakon, therefore, stirred up strife between Snorro’s kinsman Sturla and Snorro, who had to fly from Reykjaholt in 1236; and in 1237 he left the country and went back to Norway. Here he joined the party of Skuli, who was meditating a revolt. Learning that his cousin Sturla in Iceland had fallen in battle against Gissur, Snorro’s son-in-law, Snorro, although expressly forbidden by his liege lord, returned to Iceland in 1239 and once more took possession of his property. Meanwhile Hakon, who had vanquished Skuli in 1240, sent orders to Gissur to punish Snorro for his disobedience either by capturing him and sending him back to Norway or by putting him to death. Gissur took the latter course, attacked Snorro at his residence, Reykjaholt, and slew him on 22d September 1241.

Snorro is the author of the Edda and of the Sagas of the Norwegian Kings. The Edda, now called the Prose Edda, to distinguish it from the Poetic or Saemund’s Edda, was finished in 1222, and consists of three parts. (1) The Gylfaginning, or the Delusion of Gylfi, with a short preface, gives a summary of the ancient Norse mythology, founded on the Völuspá and other mythical poems; the author gives a euhemeristic account of the ancient gods, regarding them as chiefs versed in witchcraft who had immigrated to the north and there introduced their special religion. (2) The Skalds-kaparmál, or Art of Poetry, gives, under the form of a dialogue between the god Bragi and the giant (jötun) Aegir, an explanation of all figurative mythological expressions of the ancient poetry, and the rules for using them. (3) The Háttatal, or Enumeration of Metres, is a running commentary on three poems composed by Snorro in 1222 in honour of Hakon and Skuli, the stanzas of which, numbering about a hundred, are each in a different metre. In the MSS. the Edda has received many additions, which are wrongly ascribed to Snorro. For different editions see Edda. The Sagas of the Norwegian Kings gives a connected series of biographies of the kings of Norway down to Sverri in 1177; here the author stops, because the history of Sverri and his successors had already been written. The work opens with the Ynglinga Saga, a brief history of the pretended immigration into Sweden of the Aesir, of their successors in that country, the kings of Upsala, and of the oldest Norwegian kings, their descendants. Next come the biographies of the succeeding Norwegian kings, the most detailed being those of the two missionary kings Olaf Tryggvason and St Olaf. Snorro’s sources were partly succinct histories of the realm, as the chronological sketch of Ari; partly more voluminous early collections of traditions, as the Noregs Konungatal (Fagrskinna) and the Jarlasaga; partly legendary biographies of the two Olafs; and, in addition to these, studies and collections which he himself made during his journeys in Norway. All these he worked up with great independence and critical sagacity into an harmonious whole. His critical principles are explained in the preface, where he dwells on the necessity of starting as much as possible from trustworthy contemporary sources, or at least from those nearest to antiquity,—the touchstone by which verbal traditions can be tested being contemporary poems. He inclines to rationalism, rejecting the marvellous and recasting legends containing it in a more historical spirit; but he makes an exception in the accounts of the introduction of Christianity into Norway and of the national saint St Olaf. Snorro’s style is peculiar to himself. He strives everywhere to impart life and vigour to his narrative, to express the sentiments and feelings of the actors, and he gives the dialogues in the individual character of each person. Especially in this last he shows a tendency to epigram and often uses humorous and pathetic expressions. Besides his principal work, he elaborated in a separate form its better and larger part, the History of St Olaf (the great Olafs Saga). In the preface to this he gives a brief extract of the earlier history, and, as an appendix, a short account of St Olaf s miracles after his death; here too he employs critical art, as appears from a comparison with his source, the Latin legend.

The Sagas of the Norwegian Kings has been preserved in several MSS. of the 13th century; the oldest of these, no longer extant, had lost at an early period its first leaf containing the preface, and thus came to begin with the words, Kringla heimsins (=orbis terrarum), which caused first this MS. and later (about 1700) the whole work to be called the Heimskringla.
