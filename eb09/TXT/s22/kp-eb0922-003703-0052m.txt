SIEGEN, an ancient mining and manufacturing town of Prussia, in the province of Westphalia, is situated 47 miles to the east of Cologne on the Sieg, a tributary entering the Rhine opposite Bonn. The surrounding district, to which it gives its name, abounds in iron-mines, so that iron founding and smelting are important branches of industry in and near the town. Large tanneries and leather-works, and factories for cloth paper, and machinery, are among the other industrial establishments. The population in 1880 was 15,024, of whom 3632 were Roman Catholics and 111 Jews.

Siegen was the capital of an early principality belonging to the house of Nassau; and from 1606 onwards it gave name to the junior branch of Nassau-Siegen. Napoleon incorporated Siegen in the grand-duchy of Berg in 1806; and in 1815 the congress of Vienna assigned it to Prussia, under whose rule it has nearly quintupled its population. Rubens is said to have been born here in 1577.
