SIBYL. Certain women who prophesied under the inspiration of a deity were called by the Greeks Sibyls. The inspiration manifested itself outwardly in distorted features, foaming mouth, and frantic gestures. The notion that hysterical, convulsive, and epileptic affections are proof of divine inspiration has been common all over the world (see Tylor’s Primitive Culture, ii. p. 131 sq .) . Homer does not refer to a Sibyl, nor does Herodotus. The first Greek writer, so far as we know, who does so is Heraclitus (flourished about 500 b.c.). As to the number and native countries of the Sibyls much diversity of opinion prevailed, as is evinced by the contradictory statements of ancient writers. Aristophanes, Plato, and the author of the θαυμάσια ακούσματα, attributed to Aristotle, appear to know of only one Sibyl. Heraclides Ponticus, a pupil of Plato, seems to be the first writer who distinguished several Sibyls,—the Erythraean, the Phrygian, and the Hellespontine. Later writers speak of two, three, four, eight, ten, and twelve. Pausanias (x. 12) enumerates four. According to him, the oldest was the Libyan^[1. There is a gap in the text of Pausanias, and his meaning is not quite certain. ] Sibyl, a daughter of Zeus and Lamia. The second was Herophile, a native of Marpessus or Erythrae in the Troad; she lived mostly in Samos, but visited Clarus, Delos, and Delphi. She lived before the Trojan War, which she is said to have predicted. The third was the Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, and the fourth was a Hebrew Sibyl called Sabbe; others, however, called the last-mentioned Sibyl a Babylonian or Egyptian. According to Plutarch (De Pyth. Orac., 9), the first Sibyl was she of Delphi. Varro enumerates ten Sibyls,—the Persian, Libyan, Delphic, Cimmerian, Erythraean, Samian, Cuman, Hellespontine, Phrygian, and Tiburtine. The Sibyl of whom we hear most was the Sibyl of Cumae, whom Aeneas consulted before his descent to Hades. She was supposed to live 1000 years. It was she who sold to Tarquin the Proud the Sibylline books. She first offered him nine; when he refused them, she burned three and offered him the remaining six at the same price; when he again refused them, she burned three more and offered him the remaining three still at the same price. Tarquin then bought them. They were entrusted to a college of fifteen men (quindecemviri sacris faciundis ), who preserved them and consulted them on occasions of national danger. It would seem that they were consulted with a view to discover, not exact predictions of definite future events, but the religious observances necessary to avert extraordinary calamities and expiate prodigies. They were written in hexameter verse and in Greek; hence the college of curators was always assisted by two Greek interpreters. The books were kept in the temple of Jupiter on the Capitol and shared the destruction of the temple by fire in 83 b.c. After the restoration of the temple the senate sent ambassadors in 76 to Erythrae to collect the oracles afresh and they brought back about 1000 verses; others were collected in Ilium, Samos, Sicily, Italy, and Africa. In the year 12 Augustus sought out and burned a great many spurious oracles and subjected the Sibylline books to a critical revision; they were then placed by him in the temple of Apollo Patrous, where we hear of them still existing in 363. They seem to have been burned by Stilicho shortly after 400. According to the researches of Klausen (Aeneas und die Penates, [9:22:14] Hamburg, 1839-40), the oldest collection of Sibylline oracles appears to have been made about the time of Solon and Cyrus at Gergis on Mount Ida in the Troad; it was attributed to the Sibyl of Marpessus and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. Thence it passed to Erythrae, where it became famous. It was this very collection, it would appear, which found its way to Cumae and from Cumae to Rome.

The collection of so-called Sibylline oracles which has descended to us is obviously spurious, bearing marks of Jewish and Christian origin. Ewald assigns the oldest of them to about 124 b.c. and the latest to about 668-672 a.d. They have been edited by Friedlieb (Leipsic, 1852) and Alexandre (2d ed., Paris, 1869). For an examination of the different lists of Sibyls, see E. Maass, Be Sibyl-larum Indicibus, Berlin, 1879.
