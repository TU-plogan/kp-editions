SWIFT, a bird so called from the extreme speed of its flight, which apparently exceeds that of any other British species, the Hirundo apus of Linnaeus and Cypselus apus or muramus of modern ornithologists, who have at last learned that it has only an outward resemblance but no near affinity to the Swallow (ante,p. 729) or its allies. Well known as a summer-visitor throughout the greater part of Europe, it is one of the latest to return from Africa, and its stay in the country of its birth is of the shortest, for it generally disappears from England very early in August, though occasionally to be seen for even two months later.

The Swift commonly chooses its nesting-place in holes under the eaves of buildings, but a crevice in the face of a quarry, or even a hollow tree, will serve it with the accommodation it requires. This indeed is not much, since every natural function, except sleep, oviposition, and incubation, is performed on the wing, and the easy evolutions of this bird in the air, where it remains for hours together, are the admiration of all who witness them. Though considerably larger than a Swallow, it can be recognized at a distance less by its size than by its peculiar shape. The head scarcely projects from the anterior outline of the pointed wings, which form an almost continuous curve, at right angles to which extend the body and tail, resembling the handle of the crescentic cutting-knife used in several trades, while the wings represent the blade. The mode of flight of the two birds is also unlike, that of the Swift being much more steady, and, rapid as it is, ordinarily free from jerks. The whole plumage, except a greyish-white patch under the chin, is a sooty black, but glossy above. Though its actual breeding-places are by no means numerous, its extraordinary speed and discursive habits make the Swift widely distributed; and throughout England scarcely a summer’s day passes without its being seen in most places. A larger species, C. melba or C. alpinus, with the lower parts dusky white, whieh has its home in many of the mountainous parts of central and southern Europe, has several times been observed in Britain, and two examples of a species of a very distinct genus, Acanthyllis (or Chaetura), which has its home in northern Asia, but regularly emigrates thence to Australia, have been obtained in England (Proc. Zool. Society, 1880, p. 1).^[1. This species, A. caudacuta, has been generally, but Mr Hume says {Stray Feathers, ix. p. 230) wrongly, identified with the Ηirundo eiris of Pallas. So many authors have recently ascribed the foundation of the genus Chaetura to Stephens in the year 1825 that it may not be amiss to state that its origin dates only from 1826, the same year in which Boie established the commensurate genus Acanthyllis.]

Among other peculiarities the Swifts, as long ago described (probably from John Hunter’s notes) by Home (Phil. Tran s., 1817, pp. 332 et seqq., pl. xvi.), are remarkable for the development of their salivary glands, the secretions of which serve in most species to glue together the materials of which the nests are composed, and in the species of the genus Collocalia form almost the whole substance of the structure. These are the “edible” nests so eagerly sought by Chinese epicures as an ingredient for soup, and their composition, though announced many years since by Home {ut supra), whose statement was confirmed by Bernstein {Act. Soc. Sc. Indo-Néerlandicae, iii. Art. 5, and Journ, fur Ornithologie, 1859, pp. 111-119), has of late been needlessly doubted in favour of the popular belief that they were made of some kind of sea-weed, Algae, or other vegetable matter collected by the birds.^[2. Hence one species has been called Collocalia fuciphaga.] It may be hoped that the examination and analysis made by Mr J. R. Green {Journal of Physiology, vi. pp. 40-45) have settled that question for all time. These remarkable nests consist essentially of mucus, secreted by the salivary glands above mentioned, which dries and looks like isinglass. Their marketable value depends on their colour and purity, for they are often intermixed with feathers and other foreign substances. The Swifts that construct these “edible” nests form a genus Collocalia, of which the number of species is uncertain; but they inhabit chiefly the islands of the Indian Ocean from the north of Madagascar eastward, as well as many of the tropical[9:22:761] islands of the Pacific so far as the Marquesas,—one species occurring in the hill-country of India. They breed in caves, to which they resort in great numbers, and occupy them jointly and yet alternately with Bats—the mammals being the lodgers by day and the birds by night.^[3. Mr H. Pryer has given one of the latest accounts of some of these caves in North Borneo ( Proc. Zool. Society, 1885, pp. 532-538), which may be read to advantage.]

The genus Cypselus, as noted by Willughby, with its American ally Panyptila, exhibits a form of pedal structure not otherwise observed among birds. Not only is the hind-toe constantly directed forwards, but the other three toes depart from the rule which ordinarily governs the number of phalanges in the Bird’s foot,—a rule which applies to even so ancient a form as Archseopteryx (see Birds, vol. iii. p. 728),—and in the two Cypseline genera just named the series of digital phalanges is 2, 3, 3, 3, instead of 2, 3, 4, 5, which generally obtains in the Class Aves. Other Swifts, however, do not depart from the normal arrangement, and the exception, remarkable as it is, must not be taken as of more value than is needed for the recognition of two sections or subgenera admitted by Mr Sclater in his monographical essay on the Family (Proc. Zool. Society, 1865, pp. 593-617). There seem to be about half a dozen good genera of Cypselidae, and from fifty to sixty species. Their geographical distribution is much the same as that of the Hirundinidae (cf. Swallow, ut supra); but it should be always and most clearly borne in mind that, though so like Swallows in many respects, the Swifts have scarcely any part of their structure which is not formed on a different plan; and, instead of any near affinity existing between the two groups, it can scarcely be doubted by any unprejudiced investigator that the Cypselidae not only differ far more from the Hirundinidae than the latter do from any other Family of Passeres, but that they belong to what in the present state of ornithology must be deemed a distinct Order of Birds—that which in the present series of articles has been called Picarae. That the relations of the Cypselidae to the Trochilidae (cf. Humming-Bird, vol, xii. pp. 357 sq.) are close, as has been asserted by L’Herminie and Nitzsch, Dr Burmeister and Prof. Huxley, is denied by Dr Shufeldt (Proc. Zool. Society, 1885, pp. 886-914), but the views of the last have since been controverted by Mr F. Lucas (Auk, 1886, pp. 444-451); (a. n.)
