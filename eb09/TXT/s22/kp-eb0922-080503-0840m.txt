SYDENHAM, a suburb of London, in the county of Kent, is finely situated chiefly on elevated ground about 7 miles south of Charing Cross, London. There is railway communication by the London, Brighton, and South Coast, the Mid Kent branch of the South-Eastern, and the London, Chatham, and Dover lines. Formerly Sydenham was a small hamlet of Lewisham, which rose into favour from its sylvan beauty, its pleasant situation, and its medicinal waters. These springs were discovered in 1640 on Sydenham common. The quality of the water resembled that of Epsom, and was regarded as efficacious in scorbutic and paralytic affections. After the construction of a railway the suburb grew into high repute as a residence, especially for the wealthier commercial and professional classes. The construction of the Crystal Palace (see London, vol. xiv. p. 836) in 1854 greatly aided the prosperity of Sydenham, although the building is not within its boundaries. There is a public lecture hall and literary institute at Sydenham Hill, and a school of art, science, and literature in connexion with the Crystal Palace. The charitable institutions include a home and infirmary for sick children and the South London dispensary for women. The population of the township (area, 1623 acres) was 19,065 in 1871, and 26,076 in 1881.
