SOWERBY, James (1757-1822), was at first a painter, but soon applied his art to the illustration of botanical and conchological works, which are still highly valued, especially his English Botany (12 vols. 8vo, 1846). His son George (1788-1854) followed in his fatherâ€™s steps, and produced a monumental work on conchology.
