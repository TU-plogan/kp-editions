SITÁPUR, a British district in Sitápur division or commissionership of Oudh, under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western Provinces of India. It lies between 27° 7' and 27° 53' N. lat. and between 80° 21' and 81° 26' E. long., and it is bounded on the N. by Kheri district, on the E. by that of Bahraich, from which it is separated by the Gogra river, and on the S. and W. by Bara Banki, Lucknow, and Hardoi districts, the Gumti river forming the boundary. Sitápur district is elliptical in shape; its greatest length from south-east to north-west is 70 miles, and its extreme breadth from north-east to south-west 55 miles; its area is 2251 square miles. Being without hills or valleys, and devoid of forests, Sitápur presents the appearance of a vast plain sloping imperceptibly from an elevation of 505 feet above sea-level in the north-west to 400 feet in the south-east. The country is, however, well wooded with numerous groves, and well cultivated, except in those parts where the soil is barren and cut up by ravines. It is intersected by numerous streams, and contains many shallow ponds and natural reservoirs, which overflow during the rains, but become dry in the hot season. Except in the eastern portion, which lies in the doabs or alluvial plains between the Kewáni and Chauka and the Gogra and Chauka rivers, the soil is as a rule dry, but even this moist tract is interspersed with patches of land covered with saline efflorescence called “reh.” The principal rivers are the Gogra, which is navigable by boats of large tonnage throughout the year, and the Chauka. Nylghau, many varieties of deer, wild hog, wolf, jackal, and fox are common, but none of the larger wild animals are found within the district. The climate is considered healthy, and the cantonments of Sitápur are famous for the low mortality of the British troops stationed there. The average annual rainfall is about 33 inches. The district contains no railway, but it is well provided with good unmetalled roads.

In 1881 the population was returned at 958,251 (505,986 males and 452,265 females); Hindus numbered 818,738, Mohammedans 138,733, and Christians 443. Sitâpur contains but two towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants,—namely, Khairabad, 14,217, and Laharpur, 10,437. The administrative headquarters of the district are at Sitápur town, which is prettily situated on the banks of the Saráyan river, with good groves in all directions, and with a population in 1881 of 6780. Of the total district area 1455 square miles are cultivated and 510 are cultivable. The principal staples are wheat, barley, joar, gram, bajra, and rice; besides these a considerable quantity of sugar-cane is raised, as also oil seeds, cotton, and tobacco. The only manufactures of any note are tobacco and tazias at Biswán, with a little cotton printing and weaving in most of the towns. The history of Sitápur is closely associated with that of the rest of Oudh. The district figured prominently in the mutiny of 1857, when the native troops quartered in the cantonments rose in mutiny and fired on their officers, many of whom were killed, as were also several military and civil officers, with their families, in attempting to escape. Order being restored in 1858, the Government offices were re-opened, and nothing has since occurred to disturb the peace of the district.
