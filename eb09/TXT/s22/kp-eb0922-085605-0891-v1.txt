SZEGEDIN, a royal free city of Hungary, second only to Budapest, is situated on both banks of the Theiss at the influx of the Maros, in 46° 16' N. lat. and 20° 10' E. long., in the county of Csongrād. It is a great centre of the commerce and agriculture of the Alfōld, has a Roman

Catholic gymnasium, a state real school, and a library with about 80,000 volumes. There are a Franciscan, a Piarist, and a Minorite convent, and a large hospital, as well as various Government offices, a superior law court, and a chamber of advocates. The inner town consists of fine broad streets and large squares adorned with many palatial edifices, but the suburbs, inhabited by the peasantry, are little superior to ordinary Hungarian villages. The river is spanned by a railway bridge of stone and a fine suspension bridge. Szegedin possesses factories of soap, soda, matches, candles, leather, and spirits, steam and saw mills, and salt and tobacco magazines. It is the chief seat of the manufacture of paprika (a kind of pepsicum) and of a pastry tarhonya, both largely exported to all parts of the world. During the summer the shipping trade is very brisk, especially in corn and timber. Szegedin is an important station on the Alföld-Fiume and the Austrian-Hungarian State Railways, and is a terminus of the Arad-Csanād Railway. The inhabitants in 1880 numbered 73,675, and in 1885 76,600 (estimated), entirely Magyars.

Since the 15th century Szegedin has been one of the most prominent cities in Hungary. From 1526 till 1686 it was in possession of the Turks, who fortified it. It is also notorious for its many witchcraft trials. In 1848 it sent strong detachments to the national Hungarian army. In July 1849 the seat of the Government was transferred hither for a short time. In March 1879 the town was almost completely destroyed by an inundation. In the reconstruction the site of the old fortress was. laid out as a public garden.
