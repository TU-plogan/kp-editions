SRÍRANGAM, or Seringham, a town of India, in Trichinopoli district, Madras presidency, situated in 10° 51' 50" N. lat. and 78° 43' 55" E. long., 2 miles north of Trichinopoli city and almost in the centre of the island of Srírangam. The island is formed by the bifurcation of the river Káveri (Cauvery) and by the channel of the Colerun. The town is celebrated for its great temple dedicated to Vishnu, composed of seven square enclosures, 350 feet distant from each other. Each enclosure has four gates with high towers, placed one in the centre of each side opposite to the four cardinal points. The outer wall of the temple is not less than 4 miles in circumference. From 1751 to 1755 the island and its pagodas were the object of frequent contests between the French and the British. Srírangam was constituted a municipality in 1871, and since then much has been done to improve the place. In 1881 the population was 19,773 (9330 males and 10,443 females).
