STUHLWEISSENBURG (Hung. Székes-Fehérvár ; Lat. Alba Regia), the capital of the county of Fehér, and in former times also of Hungary, is situated in 47° 11'N. lat. and 18° 25' E. long., in a fertile plain. It is the see of one of the oldest bishoprics in the country, and has a number of religious charities, convents, and nunneries, a seminary, a gymnasium, and a real school. It was the coronation and burial place of the Hungarian kings from the 10th to the 16th century, but has sunk into comparative insignificance. A few years ago some very remarkable excavations were made here. The town is now chiefly agricultural; its fairs, especially for horses, are famous. The population (1885) numbers 27,000.
