SPA, a watering-place of Belgium, in the province of Liége, 20 miles by rail from Liége via Pepinster, is beautifully situated, at a height of 814 feet above the sea, in the valley of the Wayai (a small sub-tributary of the Meuse). On the north and north-east it is protected by the wooded range of hills known as the Spaloumont, or in its several parts as Bois de la Reid, Bois du Chiencul, &c.; and on the south are a number of beautiful ravines cut in the Primary rocks of the district by small affluents of the Wayai. Much of the charm of the place is due to the promenades and drives along the sides and crests of the hills. The principal mineral spring called the Pouhon (a local word for “well ”) is enclosed in a pump-room in the centre of the Place Pierre le Grand. Public baths, fed by chalybeate streams collected in a remarkable reservoir at the hamlet of Nivesé, occupy a large building in Place Royale, erected in 1868; and in the same neighbourhood is the casino, with ball and concert rooms. An English church was built in 1872-76. A local industry is the production of fancy articles in lacquered wood (bois de Spa). A liqueur resembling Chartreuse is also manufactured under the name of “elixir de Spa.” The population of the commune was 6930 in 1884. Several springs in the neighbouring district are nearly as celebrated as those of Spa proper; the Sauvenière waters, supposed to be effective against sterility, are half a mile distant.

Spa, said to derive its name from a Walloon word, Espa, for “fountain,” was practically founded by a certain Wolf, or Collin le Loup, iron-master of Breda, who had obtained benefit from the waters, and purchased the piece of ground containing the Pouhon spring from Erard de la Marck, bishop of Liége, in 1326. At the beginning of the 15th century the little town numbered 250 houses. The European celebrity of the waters dates from the 16th century, when they were drunk by the duke of Nevers, Margaret of Valois, Henry III. of France, and Alexander Farnese, and the fashion of visiting Spa became thoroughly established in the 18th century. The French Revolution, and, as far as English visitors were concerned, the attractions of the German watering-places made known by Sir Francis Head, for a time turned the tide elsewhere; but since the middle of the century Spa has taken a new lease of prosperity.
