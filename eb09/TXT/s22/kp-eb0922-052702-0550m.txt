STEARINE, in commerce, designates a solid mixture of fatty acids (chiefly palmitic and stearic) which is being produced industrially from animal fats and used largely for the making of candles. In chemistry it is a generic term for the three “esters” derivable from glycerin, C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 , by the replacement of one or more of the three (OH)’s by the residue C 18 H 35 O 2 , which, in stearic acid, is combined with “H.” Of these tri-stearine, C 3 H 5 (C ιs H 35 O 2 ) 3 , is the most important; it occurs in animal fats only, largely in tallow. It crystallizes from ether in white pearly nodules, insoluble in cold but easily soluble in boiling alcohol. It can be distilled undecomposed in vacuo. On gradual exposure to higher temperatures it fuses at 55° C.; it then resolidifies, and then fuses again (permanently) at 71°·5 (Heintz). The specific gravity of the liquid is 0·9245 at 65°∙5 C. (Duffy).
