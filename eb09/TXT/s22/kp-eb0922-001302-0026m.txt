SIBS√ÅGAR, chief town and civil headquarters of the above district, is situated about 11 miles south from the

Brahmaputra, being picturesquely placed around a magnificent tank covering an area of 114 acres. Besides the houses of the civil officials, it possesses a straggling bazaar, in which a brisk business is carried on during the cold season with the neighbouring hill tribes. In 1881 the population of the town was 5868.
