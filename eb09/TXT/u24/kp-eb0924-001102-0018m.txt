URI,^[1. The name is probably connected with the same obscure root as Urseren and Reuss, and is popularly derived from Urochs, “wild bull,” a bull’s head having been for ages borne on the cantonal shield. ] one of the Forest Cantons of Switzerland, ranks as fourth in the Confederation. It comprises the upper basin of the Reuss from its source to the Lake of Lucerne, the southern arm of which is also within the canton. Its total area is 415∙4 square miles; of these 184∙4 are classed as productive, 40∙3 are covered with forests, 44∙3 consist of glaciers, and 7∙7 of the lake. The highest point in the canton is the Galenstock (11,802 feet). The population in 1880 amounted to 23,694 (men having a majority of 3000 over women), showing an increase of 7649, or 39∙4 per cent., since 1870, owing to the St Gotthard Railway. German is the native tongue of 18,024 persons, Italian of 5313. The canton has always been very strongly Roman Catholic (23,149 in 1880). It was included up to 1814 in the diocese of Constance (except the valley of Urseren, which was in that of Chur), and since then has formed part of no diocese, but is provisionally administered by the bishop of Chur. In Uri the limits of the ecclesiastical parishes are the same as those of the civil communes. The capital is Altdorf (2901 inhabitants). Göschenen (2990) and Wasen (2744) have increased since the opening of the St Gotthard Railway (1880), which runs through the greater part of the canton. The inhabitants are occupied in agricultural and pastoral pursuits, and are very saving and industrious. The main valley is fertile, but the side glens are very wild. Education is still very backward and largely in the hands of the priests; but an improvement was made in 1885. The main characteristics of the people are extreme conservatism and a passionate attachment to their religion.

Uri is first mentioned in history in 732 as the place to which Eto, abbot of Reichenau, was banished. For the early history of the canton, see Switzerland, vol. xxii. pp. 783-787. In 1410 a perpetual alliance was made with the upper valley of Urseren or Val Orsera, the latter being allowed its own headman and assembly, and courts under those of Uri, with which it was not fully incorporated till 1803. In 1440 Uri alone won the Val Leventina for good, the title being confirmed by a treaty of 1466 with the duke of Milan and by the bloody fight of Giornico (1478). At the Reformation, Uri clung to the old faith (see Switzerland, vol. xxii. pp. 790-791). In 1798 on the formation of the Helvetic republic Uri lost all its Italian possessions. In September 1799 Suwaroff and the Russian army, having crossed the St Gotthard to Altdorf, were forced by the French to pass over into Schwyz, instead of sailing down the lake to Lucerne. In 1803 Uri became an independent canton again, with Urseren, but without the Val Leventina. It tried hard to bring back the old state of things in 1814-15, and opposed all attempts at reform, joining the League of Sarnen in 1832 to maintain the pact of 1815, opposing the proposed revision of the pact, and being one of the members of the Sonderbund in 1843. Despite defeat in the war of 1847, Uri voted against the federal constitution of 1848, and by a crushing majority against that of 1874. The existing constitution of Uri is that framed in 1850 and amended in 1851, 1872, 1879, and 1881. The “landesgemeinde,” composed of all male citizens of twenty years of age, meets annually on 1st May, and is the supreme legislative assembly. There is a subordinate legislative assembly (landrath), consisting of the landammann or headman and his deputy, 4 of the members of the executive, and 70 elected members (1 for every 300 of the population), which drafts bills and passes laws provisionally in case of necessity. The executive consists of 9 members—the landammann, his deputy, and the treasurer, with 6 elected members. By an immemorial custom 7 men of 7 different families, bearing different names, can cause an extraordinary meeting of the assembly of their “gemeinde” to be summoned, or call on the landrath to do the same in the case of the “landesgemeinde.”
