UZ. The “land of Uz” (ארץעוץ) is best known as the scene of the story of Job. Job seems to be represented as living in the country east of Palestine and not far from Edom, to which his friend Eliphaz the Temanite belonged. In Lam. iv. 21 the Edomites appear as in possession of the land of Uz, while in Gen. xxxvi. 28 Uz is one of the pre-Edomite inhabitants of Seir. On the other hand, in Gen. X. 23 and xxii. 21 Uz (or Huz) is Aramaean. Finally in Jer. xxv. 20 “the kings of the land of Uz” appear in a clause, absent from the LXX., which seems to be a gloss on the preceding clause, and so to refer to Arabs. Mediaeval tradition places the home of Job in the Hauran (see Wetzstein in Delitzsch, Iob), but it is doubtful whether all the Biblical references can apply to one district. The Septuagint forms from Uz the adjective A ύσîτις , which points to a pronunciation Aus = Arabic Aud, the name of a god whose worship was widely spread and might therefore be readily borne by tribes or attached to districts in several regions.
