URBAN III. (Uberto Crivelli), pope from 1185 to 1187, was by birth a Milanese, and was made cardinal and archbishop of Milan by Lucius III., whom he succeeded (25th November 1185). He vigorously took up his predecessor’s quarrels with the emperor Frederick I., including the standing dispute about the succession to the territories of the countess Matilda. Even after his elevation to the popedom he continued to hold the archbishopric of Milan, and in this capacity refused to crown as king of Italy Frederick’s son Henry, who had married Constantia, the heiress of the kingdom of Sicily. While Henry in the south co-operated with the rebel senate of Rome, Frederick in the north blocked the passes of the Alps and cut off all communication between the pope, then living in Verona, and his German adherents. Urban now resolved on excommunicating Frederick, but the Veronese protested against such a proceeding being resorted to within their walls; he accordingly withdrew to Ferrara, but died (19th October) before he could give effect to his intention. His successor was Gregory VIII.
