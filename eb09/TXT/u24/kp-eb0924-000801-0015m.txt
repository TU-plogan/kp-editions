URBAN, St, first pope of that name, was bishop of Rome from 222 to 230. He had been preceded by Calixtus and was followed by Pontianus. He is mentioned by Eusebius (H. E., vi. 23), and is named in an inscription in the coemeterium Callisti, but of his life nothing is known. The Roman Breviary (25th May) speaks of his numerous converts, among whom were Valerianus, husband of St Cecilia, and his brother Tiburtius, and states that he suffered martyrdom, and was buried in the coemeterium Praetextati.
