URQUHART, or Urchard,^[1. So spelt on the title page of his first work.] Sir Thomas (c. 1605- 1660), one of the most original and raciest translators from any foreign language into English, was the son of Sir Thomas Urquhart of Cromarty, the representative of a very ancient family, and of Christian, daughter of the fourth Lord Elphinstone. His birth-year is uncertain, but it is guessed at 1605, and his birthplace was the old mansion-house of Cromarty. Not much is known of his youth, or indeed of any part of his life; but he was certainly well educated, travelled over Europe, succeeded to a considerable, though much embarrassed inheritance, and got together a remarkable library, which, however, fell into the hands of his creditors. All his later life was disturbed by pecuniary and political difficulties. He was an enthusiastic Royalist; and, so far as religious matters went, his principles may be judged from his favourite signature, “C. P.,” for Christianus Presbyteromastix. He took part in the “Trot of Turriff” in 1639, and was rewarded by being knighted on 7th April 1641 by the king’s own hand at Whitehall. He took occasion by this visit to London to see through the press his first work, a collection of Epigrams of no great merit. Four years later, in 1645, he produced a tract called Trissotetras, a treatise on logarithms, adjusted to a kind of memoria technica, like that of the scholastic logic. In 1649 he was proclaimed a rebel and traitor at the Cross of Edinburgh; but this does not seem to have done him much harm, and, though he took part in the march to Worcester, and was there wounded and taken prisoner, his always embarrassed affairs do not seem to have been much worsened thereby. He published in rapid succession during 1652 and 1653 a series of tracts with quaint titles and quainter contents. Pantochrono-chanon (sic) is an almost unbelievable genealogy of the house of Urquhart up to Adam, with the names extemporized for the earlier ages in a kind of gibberish, which seems to be after the pattern of the giants and heathens in the Amadis. Ecskubalauron, supposed to be a treatise on the virtues of a jewel found in the streets of Worcester,’ is in reality a rather elaborate treatise on the virtues of the Scottish character, as shown in the Admirable Crichton [9:24:13] and others. Finally, Logopandecteision handles the subject of a universal language. These original works of Urquhart’s, as far as intrinsic literary merits go, are not of much account; but they show perhaps better than anything else that singular mixture of patriotism, generosity, shrewdness, humour, with prejudice, almost insane family pride, crotchet, pedantry, and apparent insensibility to some kinds of the ridiculous which was the dominant characteristic of a certain part of the Scottish nation, and which has furnished Sir Walter Scott with some of his most matchless studies and touches. The Translation of Rabelais, which Urquhart produced in 1653, is a very different work from the literary point of view, entering into and reproducing the author’s spirit with wonderful success, and, though by no means technically faithful, far excelling in value all merely faithful versions. Next to nothing is known of Urquhart after its date; it is said that he sought a refuge, like other cavaliers, on the Continent, and died (1660) of a fit of laughing, brought on by joy at hearing of the Restoration.

His original Works, with such scanty particulars of his life as are known, and with reproductions of two original and curious frontispieces, which represent him as a handsome and dandified wearer of full cavalier costume, were published in a stately quarto volume by the Maitland Club (Edinburgh, 1834). The Rabelais has been repeatedly reprinted, and with Motteux’s additions forms the substance of Gargantua and Pantagruel in Bohn’s Extra Series.
