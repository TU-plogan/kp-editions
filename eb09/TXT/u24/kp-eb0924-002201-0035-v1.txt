UTRERA, a town of Spain, in the province of Seville, 18 miles to the south-south-east of that city, on the railway to Jerez and Cadiz, at the junction for Moron and Osuna, lies about 8 miles from the left bank of the Guadalquivir, in a pleasant valley between two gentle undulations of the foot-hills of the southern sierra. It has no buildings of special interest; the principal church, which is large and prominent, is Gothic in style and dates chiefly from the 15th century, but some of its most conspicuous features belong to the 17th. The place enjoys considerable prosperity, due mainly to the fertility of the surrounding district, which produces large quantities of corn, and also fruit of various sorts, oil, and wine. The uncultivated “dehesas” skirting the Guadalquivir support large numbers of sheep and brood mares, and are famous throughout Spain for the bulls they send to the bull-ring. Many of the inhabitants are enterprising landowners or large farmers, and pursue highly enlightened methods of agriculture. An important fair is held at Utrera in September. The population within the municipal limits in 1877 was 15,093.

Utrera was of some importance during the Mohammedan period and has the remains of a Moorish castle. It was taken by St Ferdinand, but did not finally become subject to the sovereigns of Castile until the reign of Alphonso XI. (1340).
