URBAN IL (Eudes or Odo), pope from 1088 to 1099, was born of knightly rank, at Lagery (near Ch√¢tillon-sur-Marne), and was educated for the church. He had already become archdeacon of Rheims when, under the influence of St Bruno, his teacher, he resigned his preferment and entered the cloister at Cluny, where he rose to be prior. In 1078 Gregory VII. summoned him to Italy, and made him cardinal-bishop of Ostia. He was one of the most prominent and energetic supporters of Hildebrandism, especially as legate in Germany in 1084, and was among the few whom Gregory nominated as possible successors. Desiderius of Monte Casino (Victor III.) was chosen in the first instance to the difficult post, but at the next vacancy Odo was elected by acclamation (March 1088) at a small meeting of cardinals and other prelates held in Terracina. He frankly took up the policy of his great predecessor, but while pursuing it with equal determination showed greater flexibility and diplomatic finesse. At the outset he had to reckon with the presence of the powerful antipope Clement III. in Rome; but a series of well-attended synods held in Rome, Amalfi, Benevento, and Troia supported him in renewed declarations against simony, lay investiture, and clerical marriages, and a continued policy of opposition to Henry IV. In accordance with this last policy, the marriage of the countess Matilda with Guelph of Bavaria was promoted, Prince Conrad was helped in his rebellion against his father and crowned king of the Romans at Milan in 1093, and the empress (Adelaide or Praxedes) encouraged in her disgraceful charges against her husband. In a protracted struggle also with Philip I. of France, whom he had excommunicated, Urban II. finally proved victorious. But the most prominent feature in his pontificate, a feature indeed which marks an epoch in the history of Latin Christianity, is his connexion with the first crusade (see Crusades, vol. vi. pp. 623-624), which united Christendom under the headship of the pope into one vast warlike confederacy (comp. Popedom, vol. xix. p. 499). The crusading movement first took shape at Piacenza, where in March 1095 Urban received an embassy from the emperor Alexius I., asking help against the infidel, and where a great council met, attended by numerous Italian, Burgundian, and French bishops and by so vast a concourse of monks and laymen that the public meetings had to be held in the open air outside the city. The still more enthusiastic council of Clermont was held in November of the same year. Urban II. died on 29th July 1099, fourteen days after the fall of Jerusalem, but before the tidings of that great event had reached Italy; his successor was Paschal II.
