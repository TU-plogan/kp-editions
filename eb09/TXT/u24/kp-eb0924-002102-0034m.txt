UTICA, a city of Oneida county, New York, United States, about 180 miles north-north-west from New York City, is situated on the south bank of the Mohawk, about 400 feet above sea-level. The site of the city has a gentle slope towards the river. The surrounding country is thickly settled, the principal industries being the manufacture of cotton, woollen, and iron goods, the production of butter and cheese, and the raising of hops. Utica is the chief market for cheese in the United States. The city is touched by five railroads, the New York Central and Hudson River; New York, Ontario, and Western; Rome, Watertown, and Ogdensburg; Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western; and New York, West Shore, and Buffalo; and by the Erie Canal. The city is irregularly built. Of the manufacturing industries, which are varied, the most important is that of clothing, and next to it is that of boots and shoes. One of the State lunatic asylums is in Utica. The population of the city in 1880 was 33,914, an increase in ten years of less than 12 per cent., and in 1887 it was estimated at 40,000.

The first settlement at Utica was made near the middle of the 18th century. In 1798 the village was incorporated, and it received a city charter in 1832.
