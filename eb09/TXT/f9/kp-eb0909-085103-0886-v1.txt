FÜRTH, an important manufacturing town of Bavaria, circle of Middle Franconia, at the confluence of the Pegnitz with the Rednitz, 5 miles N.W. of Nuremberg, with which it is connected by railway. It is largely indebted for its importance to the industry and perseverance of the Jews, who at the beginning of the present century composed nearly one-half of the whole population, and now amount to about 3600. They have a college, a separate court of justice, several schools and synagogues, and two Hebrew printing establishments. The principal building of the town is the new town-house, with a tower 215 feet high. The manufactures include mirrors, jewellery, lacquered wares, chandeliers, spectacles, machines of various kinds, turnery wares, surgical instruments, lead pencils, artificial flowers, liqueurs, tobacco, leather, and woollen and cotton goods. There are also several breweries. A large annual fair is held at Michaelmas, which lasts for fourteen days. The population in 1875 was 27,360.

In 1632 Gustavus Adolphus was defeated near Fürth, in attempting to carry the intrenenments of Wallenstein; and in 1634 the town was burned down by the Croats. It was originally under the protection of the burggrafs of Nuremberg, but in 1806 it came into the possession of Bavaria. In the latter half of the 18th century it rose rapidly in importance through its manufactures, but it was not raised to the rank of a town till 1818.
