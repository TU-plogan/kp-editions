FERDINAND I. (1793-1875), emperor of Austria, the eldest son of the emperor Francis I. by his second wife Maria Theresa, daughter of Charles VI., was born in Vienna, April 19, 1793. He inherited a constitution so weak as to unfit him for the duties of his station, but his amiable and benevolent disposition secured him general respect, and acquired for him the surname of the Good. On the 2d February 1831 he married Princess Anne Caroline, third daughter of Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia, but the marriage was without issue. He was crowned nominal sovereign of Hungary under the title of Ferdinand V. in 1830, succeeded his father as emperor of Austria on the 2d March 1835, and received the crown of Bohemia in 1836, and that of Lombardy in 1839. During his whole reign the government of Austria was virtually in the hands of Prince Metternich, who continued the conservative policy of Francis I. The revolution of the 13th March 1848 compelled Metternich to resign office, and, the constitution not meeting with the approval of the revolutionists, Ferdinand fled to Innsbruck. At the urgent request of all parties he shortly afterwards returned to Vienna, but on a renewal of the outbreak he left the capital for Olmiitz in Moravia, where, feeling himself unfit to cope with the difficulties of government, he was persuaded to abdicate in favour .of his nephew Francis Joseph, 2d December 1848. He spent the remainder of his life in retirement, chiefly at Prague in Bohemia, where he died 29th June 1875.
