FORKEL, Johann Nikolaus (1749-1818), was a native of Coburg in Saxony. As a practical musician, especially as a pianoforte player, Forkel achieved some eminence in his profession; but his claims to a more abiding name rest chiefly upon his literary skill and deep, research as a writer and historian in the department of musical science and literature. He obtained the degree of doctor in philosophy, and for some time held the appointment of director of the music at the university of Gottingen. The following is a list of his principal works :— Ueber die Theorie der Musik, Göttingen, 1774; Musicalis Kritische Bibliothek, Gotha, 1778; Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik, Leipsic, 1781. The last is his most important work. He also wrote a Dictionary of Musical Lit er attire, which is full of valuable material.
