FARNABIE, or Farnaby, Thomas (1575-1647), grammarian, classical commentator, and one of the most noted schoolmasters of his day, was a native of London. He was the son of a carpenter; his grandfather, it is said, had been mayor of Truro, his great-grandfather an Italian musician. Between 1590and 1595 heappears successively as a student of Merton, a pupil in a Jesuit college in Spain, and a follower of Drake and Hawkins during their expedi tion in the last-named year. After some military service in the Low Countries, “he made shift,” says Wood, “to be set on shore in the western part of England; where, after some wandering to and fro under the name of Tho. Bainrafe, the anagram of his surname, he settled at Martock, in Somersetshire, and taught the grammar school there for some time with good success. After he had gotten some feathers at Martock, he took his flight to London,” and opened a school in Goldsmith’s Rents, Cripplegate. From this school, which contained as many as 300 pupils, there issued, says the same authority, “more churchmen and statesmen than from any school taught by one man in England.” In the course of his London career “he was made master of arts of Cambridge, and soon afterwards incorporated at Oxon.” Such was his pecuniary success in the metropolis that he was enabled to buy an estate at Otford near Sevenoaks, Kent, to which he retired from London in the year 1636, still, however, carrying on his profession of schoolmaster, his pupils, it appears, being all, or nearly all, boarders—the sons of noblemen and gentlemen. In course of time he increased his property at Otford, and bought [9:9:36] another estate near Horsham in Sussex. In politics he was a Royalist; and it was in consequence of his suspected participation in the rising near Tunbridge, 1643, that the parliament discussed a proposal for his banishment to America, and eventually imprisoned him in Ely House, Holborn. He died in June 1647. These details of his life were derived, by Anthony à Wood, from Francis, Farnabie’s son by his second wife, who was the daughter of Dr Howson, bishop of Durham. His works chiefly consisted of annotated editions of Juvenal, Persius, Seneca, Martial, Lucan, Virgil, Ovid, and Terence. His Systema Grammaticum was published in London in 1641. On 6th April 1632 Farnabie was presented with a royal patent granting him, for the space of twenty-one years, the sole right of printing and publishing certain of his works.
