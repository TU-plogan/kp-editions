FREIBURG, or Freyburg, usually distinguished as Freiburg in the Breisgau, is a city formerly of the Austrian dominions but now in the grand-duchy of Baden, about 12 miles E. of the Rhine, at the foot of the Schlossberg, one of the heights of the Black Forest range. It is one, of the stations on the railway between Basel and Mannheim, and lies about 40 miles northwards from the former city. The town is for the most part well built, having several wide and handsome streets and a number of spacious squares. It is kept clean and cool by the waters of the Dreisam, which flow through the streets in open channels; and its old fortifications have been replaced by public walks, and, what is more unusual, by vineyards. Since 1827 Freiburg has been the seat of an archbishop who has authority over the bishops of Mainz, Fulda, Rottenberg, and Limberg; and it possesses a famous Catholic university, the Ludovico Albertina, which owes its origin to Albert VI., archduke of Austria, and dates from 1454, 1456, or 1457. This was at one time a very wealthy institution, having been endowed by its founder with extensive lands in the Breisgau, Upper Alsatia, and Wurtemberg; but since the French Revolution it has lost nearly all its estates, and the revenue derived from those still held in Baden is not sufficient for its expenses. In 1876 it had 41 professors, ordinary and extraordinary, and 9 privat-docenten, and the students numbered 290, of whom 141 were foreigners. The library contains upwards of 250,000 volumes; and among the other [9:9:765] auxiliary establishments are an anatomical hall and museum and bo anical gardens. The Freiburg minster is considered one of the finest of all the Gothic churches of Germany, being remarkable alike for the symmetry of its proportions, for the taste of its decorations, and for the fact that it may mor j correctly be said to be finished than almost any other building of the kind. The period of its erection probably lies for the most part between 1122 and 1252; bat the choir was not built till 1513. The tower, which rises above the western entrance, is 386 feet in height, and it presents a skilful transition from a square base into an octagonal superstructure, which in its turn is surmounted by a pyramidal spire of the most exquisite open work in stone. In the interior of the church are some beautiful stained glass windows, both ancient and modern, the tombstones of several of the dukes of Zähringen, statues of archbishops of Freiburg, and paintings by Holbein and by Hans Balding, surnamed Grün. Among the other noteworthy buildings of Freiburg are the palaces of the grand duke and the arch bishop, the town hall, the theatre, the Kaufhaus or merchants’ hall, a 16th-century building with the front painted red, the Protestant church, formerly the church of the abbey of Thennenbach, removed thither in 1839, the hall of art and harmony, and the barracks, erected by the Austrian Government in 1776, and capable of containing 5000 men. The charitable institutions include a foundling hospital, an orphan asylum, a blind asylum, and a military hospital. In the centre of the fishmarket square is a fountain surmounted by a statue of Duke Berthold III. of Zähringen, the founder of the city; in the Franciskaner Platz there is a monument to Schwarz, the traditional discoverer of gunpowder; the Rotteck Platz takes its name from the monument of Rotteck, the historian, which formerly stood on the site of the Schwarz statue; and in Kaiser Wilhelm Strasse a bronze statue was erected in 1876 to the memory of Herder, who in the early part of the 19th century founded in Freiburg an institute for draughtsmen, engravers, and lithographers, and carried on a famous bookselling business. On the Schlossberg above the town there are massive ruins of two castles which were destroyed by the French in 1744; and about two miles to the N.E. stands the castle of Zähringen. the original seat of the famous family of counts. Situated on the ancient road which runs by the Höllenpass between the valleys of the Danube and the Rhine, Freiburg early acquired commercial importance, and it is still the principal centre of the trade of the Black Forest. It manufactures chicory, chemicals, starch, leather, tobacco, silk thread, paper, and hempen goods, as well as beer and wine. The population is rapidly increasing. In 1864 it numbered 19,085, inclusive of the suburbs of Herdern and Wiehre, and in 1875 no less than 30,531. About a sixth of the whole are Protestants.

Freiburg was founded, as has been already stated, by Count Berthold 111. of Zähringen. In 1120 it became a free town, with privileges similar to those of Cologne; but in 1219 it fell into the hands of a branch of the family of Urach. After it had vainly attempted to throw off the yoke by force of arms, it obtained its freedom in 1366 for a sum of 20,000 silver marks; but as it was unable to reimburse the creditors who had advanced the money, it was, in 1368, obliged to recognize the supremacy of the house of Haρsburg. In the 17th and 18th centuries it played a considerable part as a fortified town. It was captured by the Swedes in 1632, 1634, and 1638; and in 1644 it was seized by the Bavarians, who shortly after, under General Marcey, defeated in the neighbourhood the French forces under Enghien and Turcnne. The French were in possession from 1677 to 1697, and again in 1713-14 and 1744 , and when they left the place in 1748, at the peace of Aix-la∙ Chapelle, they dismantled the fortifications. The Baden insurgents gained a victory at Freiburg in 1848, and the revolutionary Government took refuge in the town in June 1849, but in the following July the Prussian forces took possession, and did not leave till 1851.
