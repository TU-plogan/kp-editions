FONTANES, Louis, Marquis de (1757-1821), French poet and politician, was born at Niort, in Poitou, March 6, 1757. He was a descendant of a noble Protestant family of Languedoc, banished by the revocation of the edict of Nantes, but afterwards converted to the Catholic faith and restored to their native land. Having completed his education at the college of Niort, he went in 1777, after the death of his father and brother, to Paris. He had already made several attempts in verse; and in 1778 he published a short descriptive poem entitled La Forêt de Navarre. This procured him the notice and friendship of Ducis, and he was encouraged to persevere. During the next twelve years he published Le Cri de mon Coeur; Le Jour des Morts dans une Campagne, an imitation of Gray’s Elegy·, a translation of Pope’s Essay on Man (1783), with an elegant introduction which attracted more attention than the poem itself; Le Verger; La Chartreuse de Paris; and L ’ Essai sur l , Astronomie (1789). In this year appeared also his Èpltre sur VÉdit en Faveur des non- Catholiques, which was crowned by the academy. The Revolution converted the poet into a journalist, and he took part in the editorship of the Mercure François and the Modérateur. Compelled to leave Paris after the death of the king, he withdrew to Lyons, where he married and remained till the arrival of Collot d’Herbois in 1793. Driven again to lead a wandering life, he displayed at once his literary power, his patriotism, and his intrepidity in the eloquent petition on behalf of the Lyonnese victims of Collot d’Herbois and his colleagues, which was presented to the convention in December of that year. For this bold appeal he was proscribed, and he owed his protection in concealment to the friendship of Madame Dufresnoy. After the fall of Robespierre, Fontanes was appointed professor of belles lettres at the central school, and admitted a member of the Institute. About the same time he was associated with La Harpe in the conduct of the Memorial. For one of his articles he was condemned to banishment by the Directory and expelled from the Institute. He escaped to England, and there renewed his acquaintance with Chateaubriand, also an exile. Returning to France after the 18th Brumaire, he was soon after commissioned by the first consul to write the funeral oration on Washington, and this opened a new chapter in his life. Bonaparte, satisfied with the Eloge, admitted Fontanes to frequent intercourse with him; he was soon reinstated at the Institute, and became a member of the legislative body, of which in 1804 he was made president. He was also one of the first members of the Legion of Honour; and in 1808 he was made grand master of the university. Fontanes was censured by the republican party for alleged servility to the emperor; but apparently without reason. He was created count, and in 1810 was called to the senate. He voted for the deposition of Napoleon, retained his offices under the provisional government, and was made a peer by Louis XVIII. In February 1815 the post of grand master of the university was suppressed, and Fontanes was promoted grand cordon of the Legion of Honour. He remained passive during the Hundred Days, and after the second restoration of the Bourbons was made a privy councillor. The title of marquis was conferred on him in 1817. In January 1821 he was chosen president of the Société des Bonnes Lettres; but his health had long been declining, and he died at Paris on the 17 th of March of that year. He left unfinished a poem entitled La Grèce Délivrée, of which high expectations had been formed. A collected edition of the works of Fontanes was first published by Sainte-Beuve, with a critical and biographical memoir, in 1837.
