FRÉRON, Élie Catherine (1719-1776), a French critic and controversialist, was born at Quimper in 1719. He was educated by thè J esuits, and made such rapid progress in hi s studies that before the age of twenty he was appointed professor at the college of Louis-le-Grand. On resigning his connexion with the Jesuits in 1739, he was employed by the Abbé des Fontaines as a contributor to his Observations sur les Ferits Modernes. After the death of the latter in 1746 he founded a similar journal of his own, entitled Lettres de la Comtesse de * * *. It was suppressed in 1749, but he immediately replaced it by Lettres sur quelques écrits de ce temps, which, with the exception of a short suspension in 1752, on account of an attack on the character of Voltaire, was continued till 1754, when it was succeeded by the more ambitious L'Année Littéraire. His death at Paris on the 10th March 1776 is said to have been hastened by thè temporary suppression of this journal. Fréron is now’ remembered solely for his attacks on Voltaire and the Encyclopedists, and the fame of his criticisms is not due to their inherent merits, which, notwithstanding a certain clever malignity, are very slight, but to the retaliations they provoked on the part of Voltaire, who, besides attacking him in epigrams, and even incidentally in some of his tragedies, directed against him a virulent satire entitled Le Pauvre Diable, and also made him the principal personage in a comedy L'Ecossaise, in which the journal of Fréron is designated L'Ane Littéraire.

Besides conducting the serials already mentioned, Fréron is the author of Ode sur la bataille de Fontenoy, 1745; Histoire de Marie Stuart, 1742, in 2 vols.; and Histoire de l ’ cmpirc d ’ Allemagne, 1771, in 8 vols.
