FERDINAND I. (1423-1494), king of Naples, the illegitimate son of Alphonso V. of Aragon and I. of Sicily and Naples, was born in 1423. In accordance with his fatherâ€™s will, he succeeded him on the throne of Naples in 1458, but Pope Calixtus III. having refused to recognize him, John of Anjou, desirous to turn to advantage the opportunity of regaining the throne of his ancestors, invaded the country, and inflicted on him a severe defeat, July 7, 1460. Ferdinand fled to Naples accompanied by only twenty cavaliers, but having by certain concessions obtained recognition from Pius II., who about this time succeeded Calixtus on the papal throne, he received through him the aid of the Albanian chief Scanderbeg, and defeated John of Anjou at Troja with great loss, August 18, 1462. In 1480 the Turks captured Otranto from Ferdinand, and massacred the majority of the inhabitants, but in the following year it was retaken. The only other event of importance during his reign was an abortive attempt at revolt on the part of the nobles in 1485, many of whom, notwithstanding that he promised them a general amnesty, were afterwards treacherously murdered by his commands. On account of his refusing to pay to Innocent VIII. the censustax promised by him to Pius IL, he was in 1489 excommunicated, but he subsequently gained the favour of Alexander VI. He died 25th January 1494, while Charles VIII. of France was preparing to invade his dominions. Though cruel in the infliction of punishment, and ready without scruple to break his promises when it suited him. Ferdinand generally dealt out to his subjects even-handed justice, favoured the spread of knowledge, and greatly increased the industrial and commercial prosperity of his kingdom.
