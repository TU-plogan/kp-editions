FORTH, one of the largest rivers in Scotland. It is formed of two streams rising to the north of Ben Lomond, (one of them passing through Loch Chon and Loch Ard), which unite above Aberfoyle. The river flows eastward in a direct course for above 100 miles, receiving in its progress the Goodie, the Teith, and the Allan above Stirling, and below it the Devon, the Carron, the Avon, the Almond, the Leith, the Esk, the Leven, the Tyne, and others; and it discharges itself into the German Ocean in about 56° 10' N. lat. The windings or “links” of the Forth above and below Stirling are extremely tortuous. From its junction with the Teith to the “carse” or alluvial plain below Gartmore they extend about 28 miles, although the distance in a direct line is only about 20. From Stirling harbour to Alloa, where it widens into an estuary, the length of the river is 10 j miles, though the distance in a straight line is not more than 5. From Grangemouth to North Queensferry the depth increases in the first mile from 10 to 15 feet, in the second to 25, and in the third mile to 53 feet, while the remaining part of the distance—7 miles, including the great anchorage of St Margaret’s Hope—has a depth generally of about 60 feet at low water. At Queensferry the firth is 2 miles wide; between Dysart and Aberlady about 12; and between St Abb’s Head and Fifeness, where it joins the German Ocean, it is from 35 to 40 miles. Near Queensferry, between Inchgarvie and the North shore, it deepens to 37 fathoms. The bed of the river consists to a great extent of mud,—the depth of the deposit in some places being [9:9:421] upwards of 200 feet; and there are extensive alluvial formations along the lower part of its course, and in the upper reaches of its estuary. The tides are felt 4¾ miles above Stirling, and at Stirling harbour the spring tides rise 7 feet 9 inches. At Leith and Kinghorn their average height is 17∣ feet. Steamers go as far up the river as Stirling,— the only important obstructions to the navigation between that town and Alloa, the “Town Ford” and the “Abbey Ford,” having been removed since 1843. The shallowness of the channel seems to have been occasioned by the practice in vogue from 1732 among the Stirlingshire proprietors of using the river to carry off the peat from their lands; Mr Drummond of Blair-Drummond, for example, between 1783 and 1839 floated away upwards of 1000 acres of this substance. Further down in the firth the principal obstructions are the Drumsands near Cramond and the Sand-end to the east of Burntisland harbour. The anchorages in the firth are excellent; and it thus forms the most important harbour of refuge to the north of the Humber. Several of its ports carry on a large foreign trade, more especially Leith, Granton, Bo’ness, and Grangemouth. The fisheries of herring, white fish, and salmon are all of great economical importance, not only giving employment to a considerable local population, but attracting English and even foreign fishermen. The traffic between the two sides of the firth has been an object of legislation since 1467. Both the principal ferries—that between North and South Queensferry, and that between Granton and Burntisland—are now in the hands of the North British Railway Company. In connexion with their system they have undertaken to construct a magnificent viaduct across the firth, the foundation stone of which was laid on the 30th of September 1878. Thomas Bouch, the engineer entrusted with the enterprise, has practically revived a plan proposed as early as 1818 by James Anderson. The bridge is to cross a little to the east of the present line of traffic between North and South Queensferry, advantage being taken of the small island of Inchgarvie, which lies about mid channel. Its most striking features will be two spans of 1600 feet, constructed on the suspension principle, at a height of 150 feet above high water of spring tides. In order to secure sufficient stability against the lateral pressure of the winds, which sometimes blow with great violence in the firth, these central portions will be split into two branches, each about 14 feet wide, which will lie 100 feet apart, but be bound together by horizontal braces. Both the great spans will be laid on a dead level, but the shoreward sections will have gradients of about one in 77 and one in 80. The total cost is estimated at £1,250,000, and it is expected that the works will be completed in 1882.
