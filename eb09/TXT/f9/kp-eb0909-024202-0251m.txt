FISHER, John, bishop of Rochester, was born at Beverley in Yorkshire, but the year of his birth is uncertain, some placing it in 1459, others in 1461, and others in 1465. He was educated in the collegiate church of Beverley, and in 1484 he removed to Michael House in Cambridge, of which college he was elected master in the year 1495. Having applied himself to the study of divinity, he took orders; and becoming eminent as a divine, attracted the notice of Margaret, countess of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., who appointed him her chaplain and confessor. In 1501 he took the degree of doctor in divinity, and the same year was elected chancellor of the university. In the year following the first appointment of the newly-established Margaret professorship in divinity was conferred upon him; and in 1504 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester. Fisher has been erroneously credited with the composition of the Assertio Septem Sacramentorum, in which Henry VIII. attacked the heretic Luther, and for which the pope conferred upon his Majesty the title of “Defender of the Faith.” Sir Thomas More and Fisher, however, published their respective rejoinders to the Reformer’s reply to the king. Hitherto he had retained the friendship and esteem of the king; but from 1527 till his death he was acknowledged as, next to Sir Thomas More, the most influential man of the anti-royal or papal party in England. He published a pamphlet against the divorce of Catherine of Aragon, which was widely disseminated on the Continent, and also secretly circulated in England. In 1533 the parliament found him guilty of misprision of treason, for concealing certain prophetic speeches of Elizabeth Barton, a fanatical impostor known as the Holy Maid of Kent, relative to the king’s death, and condemned him, with five others, to suffer loss of goods and imprisonment during his majesty’s pleasure. He was subsequently released upon payment of a fine of £300. Fisher excused his silence on the ground that the nun had told him that she had communicated her prophecies to Henry in person, but he nevertheless refused to express regret for having been unwittingly connected with treasonable designs. As to the great question of the day, Fisher offered to swear to the succession in the line of Anne Boleyn’s issue, but he refused to acknowledge either the validity of her marriage or the king’s supremacy. For this refusal he was attainted by the parliament of 1534, and committed to the Tower. At this juncture Pope Paul III. sent him a cardinal’s hat. This kindness, however, only hastened the bishop’s ruin. He was beheaded at Tower Hill on the 22d of June 1535. It is impossible to withhold from Fisher, notwithstanding his inflexible enmity to the Reformation, the character of a learned, pious, and honest man. His works attest his learning; his inflexible zeal for his faith, and the readiness with which he died for his creed, plainly prove his honesty as well as his piety. His execution was a sad tragedy, defensible only on the plea of political necessity. For the latest apology for Bishop Fisher, see the Rev. R. W. Watson’s History of the English Church, vol. i., 1877.

Fisher was the author of a considerable number of controversial tracts, most of which were collected and printed in one volume folio, Eublished at Wurtzburg in 1595. A Life of Fisher, by Rev. John ∣ewis, A.M., was published in 1855, in two volumes.
