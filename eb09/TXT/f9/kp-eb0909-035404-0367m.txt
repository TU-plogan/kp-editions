FOKSHAN, or Fokshani, a town of Roumania, is situated 104 miles N.E. of Bucharest on the river Milkov, which forms the boundary line between Wallachia and Moldaviaâ€”the larger portion of the town being in Wallachia. It possesses a normal school, and is the seat of a prefecture and of a criminal and district court of justice. It has a considerable trade in corn with Galatz, and is in the vicinity of the district which produces the best Moldavian wine. A congress between Russian and Turkish diplomatists was held near the town in 1772. In the neighbourhood the Turks suffered a severe defeat from the Austrians and Russians in 1789. The population in 1873 was 20,323.
