FRESNEL, Augustin Jean (1788-1827), an illustrious French physicist, the son of an architect, was born at Broglie, in the department of Eure, in France, May 10,1788. His early progress in learning was slow, and when eight years old he was still, unable to read. At the age of thirteen he entered the Ecole Centrale in Caen, and at sixteen and a half the École Polytechnique, where he acquitted himself with distinction. Thence he went to the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées. He served as an engineer successively in the departments of Vendée, Drome, and Ille-et-Villaine; but his espousal of the cause of the Bourbons in 1814 occasioned, on Napoleon’s reaccession to power, the loss of his appointment. On the second restoration he obtained a post as engineer in Paris, where much of his life from that time was spent. His researches in optics, continued until his death, appear to have been begun about the year 1814, when he prepared a paper on the aberration of light, which, however, was not published. In 1818 he read his celebrated memoir on diffraction, for which in the ensuing year he received the prize of the Academy of Sciences at Paris. He was in 1823 unanimously elected a member of the Academy, and in 1825 he became a member of the Royal Society of London, which in 1827, at the time of his last illness, awarded him the Rumford medal. In 1819 he was nominated a commissioner of lighthouses, for which he was the first to construct compound lenses as substitutes for mirrors (see Lighthouses). Fresnel died of consumption at Ville-d’Avray, near Paris, July 14, 1827. The undulatory theory of light enunciated by Hooke, and upheld by Huygens and Euler, but first founded upon experimental demonstration by Thomas Young, was extended to a large class of optical phenomena, and permanently established, by the brilliant discoveries and the mathematical deductions of Fresnel. By the use of two plane mirrors of metal, forming with each other an angle of nearly 180°, he avoided the diffraction caused in Grimaldi’s experiment on interference by the employment of apertures for the transmission of the light, and was thus enabled in the most conclusive manner to account for the phenomena of interference in accordance with the undulatory theory. With Arago he studied the laws of the interference of polarized rays, and discovered that though when similarly polarized they affect each other as do ordinary rays, yet when rectangularly polarized they have no power of interference. Circularly polarized light Fresnel obtained by means of a rhomb of glass, known as “Fresnel’s rhomb,” having obtuse angles of 126°, and acute angles of 54°. His labours in the cause of optical science received during his lifetime only scant public recognition, and some of his papers were not printed by the Academy of Sciences till many years after his decease. But, as he wrote to Young in 1824, in him “that sensibility, or that vanity, which people call love of glory” had been blunted. “All the compliments,” he says, “that I have received from Arago, Laplace, and Biot never gave me so much pleasure as the discovery of a theoretic truth, or the confirmation of a calculation by experiment.” For further details as to the scientific achievements of Fresnel see Arago and Optics. His papers were published chiefly in the memoirs of the Academy of Sciences, the bulletins of the Société Philomatique, and the Annales de Chimie.
