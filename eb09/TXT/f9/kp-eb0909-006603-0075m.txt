FELIX, Antonius, a Roman procurator of Judaea, Samaria, Galilee, and Peraea, entered upon his office in the 11th or 12th year of the emperor Claudius. Both he and his brother Pallas were originally slaves, and, it is said, owed their freedom to Antonia, wife of the emperor, on which account it is probable that Felix received the surname Antonius. By some writers he is also called Claudius. Felix was cruel and licentious, and his accessibility to bribes led to a great increase of crime in Judaea under his government. The apostle Paul, after being apprehended in Jerusalem, was sent to be judged before Felix at Caesarea, and so reasoned before him of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come that Felix trembled. He nevertheless retained Paul in custody for two years, hoping that a bribe would be offered to secure his liberty, but at the end of this time Felix was succeeded in the government by Festus, and in order to gratify the Jewish people left Paul bound. On returning to Rome Felix was accused of having taken advantage of a dispute between the Jews and Syrians of Caesarea to slay and plunder the inhabitants, but through the intercession of his brother Pallas, who had great influence with the emperor Nero, he escaped unpunished.
