FORDUN, John of. Little is known with any certainty of this chronicler, and the so-called lives of him are mainly a collection of conjectures more or less probable. The credulity of our early writers is pardonable; the nonsense of some later ones is without excuse. A notice inserted in the New Statistical Account of the parish of Fordoun in Kincardineshire begins thus :—“John of Fordun, the historian, was either a native of the parish or resident in it, when he wrote his history of Scotland. He is called by Bede ‘venerabilis vir Dominus Joannes Fordun, Presbyter.’” The writer’s notions of chronology must have been somewhat peculiar. The statement generally made that the chronicler was boru at Fordoun has apparently no better foundation than his name. It is certain that he was a secular priest, and that he composed his history in the latter part of the 14th century; and it is probable that he was a chaplain in the cathedral of Aberdeen. The work of Fordun is the earliest attempt to write a continuous history of Scotland; nothing existed previously except brief chronicles and genealogical memoranda. It is divided into five books. The first three are almost entirely fabulous, and form the groundwork on which Boece and Buchanan afterwards raised the huge structure of historical and political fiction, which was first exposed by Thomas Innes in his Critical Essay. The 4th and 5th books, though still mixed with fable, contain much valuable information, and become more authentic the more nearly they approach the author’s own time. The 5th book concludes with the death of King David I. in 1153. Besides these five books, Fordun wrote part of another book, and collected materials for bringing down the history to a later period. These materials were used by a continuator who wrote in the middle of the 15th century, and who is commonly, and no doubt correctly, identified with Walter Bower, abbot of the monastery of Inchcolm. The additions of Bower form eleven books, and bring down the narrative to the death of King James I. in 1437. According to the custom of the time, the continuator did not hesitate to interpolate Fordun’s portion of the work with additions of his own, and the whole history thus compiled is known as the Scotichronicon. The first printed edition of Fordun’s work was that of Thomas Gale in his Scriptores Quindecim, which was published in 1691. This was followed by Thomas Hearne’s edition in 1722. The whole work, including Bower’s continuation, was published by Walter Goodall at Edinburgh in 1759. In 1871 and 1872 Fordun’s chronicle, in the original Latin and also in an English translation, was edited by Mr William F. Skene in the series of The Historians of Scotland. Mr Skene’s preface to this valuable edition contains full information both in regard to the author, the manuscripts of his work, and the printed editions. Reference may also be made to Thomas Innes’s Critical Essay, vol. i. p. 201-214; to the biographical notice of Fordun in the second volume of Tytlefi 's Lives of Scottish Worthies; and to Mr Felix G. H. Skene’s preface to the “Liber Huscardensis,” in the series of The Historians of Scotland.
