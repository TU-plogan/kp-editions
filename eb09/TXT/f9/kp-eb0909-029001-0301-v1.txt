FLANDERS (German Flandern, Dutch Vlaendern), an ancient countship of the Low Countries, which has left its name to two provinces of the modern kingdom of Belgium, distinguished as East and West. It took its rise about the time of Charles the Great, but the early history of the line of counts is far from certain, the older chronicles giving very different statements. Leaving out of view those mythical personages through whom as a matter of course a connexion is established with Priam of Troy, we find the founder of the family of the Foresters, as they are called, in a certain Lideric le Buc, “only son of Saluart prince of Dijon, and of Madame Eringarde daughter of Gerard lord of Roussillon,” who, says Lambert, canon of St Omer, “videns Flandriam vacuam et incultam ac memorosam, occupavit eam.” Even Lideric is of doubtful authenticity, though his death in 836 is mentioned in the Annales Blandinienses, which were compiled before 1064 from earlier documents. His son Ingelramn, say the chronicles, had a son Audacer; but according to several modem investigators Audacer was merely a cognomen of Baldwin, the next person in the genealogical series. With Baldwin, who is distinguished as Bras de Fer or Iron Arm, we at length reach the terra firma of history. He was a strong, daring, and unscrupulous man, and made noise enough in his own day, more particularly by carrying off and marrying Judith daughter of Charles the Bald of France, a lady of easy principles, who had already been the wife of Aethelwulf of the West Saxons of England, and for a time of Aethelwulf’s son Aethelbald. Baldwin II., the Bald, born of this marriage, is mainly remembered as a vigorous opponent of the Normans, and as the builder of the walls of Bruges and Ypres. It is said that he also laid the foundation of the political liberties of his country by appointing twelve of his principal vassals as a council of state. He took to wife Aelfthryth, daughter of King Alfred of England. On his death in 918, his possessions were divided between his two sons Arnulf the Elder and Adolphus; but the latter survived only a short time, and Arnulf succeeded to the whole inheritance. His reign was full of troubles with the Normans on the one hand, and with the emperor Otho I. on the other; and he made one of his conferences memorable by murdering William Longsword the Norman duke. In his old age he placed the government in the hands of Baldwin, his son by Adela daughter of the count of Vermandois, and the young man, though his reign was a very short one, did a great deal for the commercial and industrial progress of the country, establishing the first weavers and fullers of Ghent, and instituting yearly fairs at Ypres, Bruges, Veurne, Cassel, Coudrai, Thorout, and Rousselare. On Baldwin’s death in 961 the old count resumed the control, and spent the few remaining years of his life in securing the succession of his grandson Arnulf or Arnold the younger. The reign of Arnulf was terminated by his death in 989, and he was followed by his son Baldwin IV., styled Pulchra Barba, Comely Beard, or simply Barbatus, Met den Baerd, With the beard. This Baldwin fought successfully both against the king of Franco and the emperor Henry II., and obtained from the latter Valenciennes, Walcheren, and the islands of Zealand. The counts of Flanders thus became feudatories of the empire as well as of France. Baldwin’s son Baldwin V., surnamed of Lille (in Latin Insularius, in Dutch Van Ryssel) rebelled in 1028 against his father, at the instigation of his wife Adela, daughter of Robert of France; but two years later peace was sworn at Oudenarde, and the old man continued to reign till his death in 1036. Baldwin V. proved a worthy successor, and acquired from the people the title of Débonnaire. He was an active, ambitious, enterprising man, and greatly extended his power by wars and alliances. Before his death he saw his eldest daughter Matilda sharing the English throne with William the Conqueror, his son Baldwin of Mons (in Dutch Bergen) in possession of Hainault in right of his wife Richilde the widow of the late count, and his son Robert the Frisian ruling over the countship of Holland and Friesland in right [9:9:291] of the countess Gertrude. His younger daughter Judith had married Tostig, brother of Harold II. of England. On his death in 1067, Baldwin of Mons succeeded to the countship of Flanders, apparently without opposition on the part of Robert his elder brother; but α few years afterwards a quarrel broke out, and Baldwin was slain. Robert now claimed the tutelage of Baldwin’s children, and obtained the support of the emperor Henry IV.; while Richilde, Baldwin’s widow, appealed to Philip of France. The contest was decided at Ravenchoven, near Cassel, February 22, 1071, where Robert was victor, and Arnulf III., Baldwin’s son, was slain. Arras, Douai, Tournai, and other towns of French Flanders had taken part with the countess and the French, while Ghent, Bruges, Ypres, Courtrai, and other towns of Flanders proper were on the side of Robert. The successful competitor held the countship till his death in 1093, when he was succeeded by his son Robert IL, who became famous for his exploits in the first crusade, and acquired the title of Lance x and Sword of Christendom. Baldwin VII., surnamed A la Hache, or With the Axe, became count on Robert’s death in 1119, and in his turn transmitted the dignity to his cousin Charles of Denmark, son of Canute and Adelais, daughter of Robert the Frisian. This Charles of Denmark was a religious enthusiast, and exercised his authority against all swearers, necromancers, Jews, and usurers. At Bruges in 1127 he ordered all the granaries to be thrown open; and the merchants who had expected to make gain by the dearth were so enraged that they formed a conspiracy and procured his assassination in the church of St Donat. No fewer than six pretenders to the countship now appeared, and among the rest William Clito, son of Robert Courthose of Normandy, and Thierri or Theodoric of Alsace. The latter was the successful competitor, and he married the widow of Count Charles, Marguerite of Clermont. He distinguished himself at home by the wise encouragement which he gave to the growth of popular liberty, and abroad by the part which he took in several crusading expeditions. In the latter years of his life he retired to Gravelines, leaving the cares of state to his son Philip, who when he came to rule in his own name followed in his father’s footsteps, and acquired the honourable reputation of “the greatest lawgiver of Flanders.” He married Elizabeth of Vermandois, and on her death had a violent dispute with the French monarch about the possession of Vermandois, which was ultimately granted him during his life. As he had no children his inheritance went to Baldwin of Hainault, who had married his sister Marguerite,—a change of the dynasty which considerably affected the relations of Flanders with France. The French king laid claim to the countship, and Baldwin was constrained to cede Artois, St Omer, Lens, Hesdin, and a great part of southern Flanders to France, and to allow Matilda of Portugal, the widow* of Philip, to hold Lille, Cassel, Veurne, Rille, and Sluys. Marguerite died in 1194 and Baldwin in 1195, and the countship devolved on their son Baldwin IX., who became the founder of the Latin empire at Constantinople, and perished in Bulgaria in 1206. The emperor’s two daughters were both under age, and accordingly the government of Flanders and Hainault was entrusted to his brother Philip, assisted by Bosschaert of Avesnes and William of Hainault. Johanna the elder daughter was married to Ferdinand or Ferrand of Portugal, but left no heir; and so the inheritance of both Flanders and Hainault passed on her death in 1279 to the children of the younger, Margaret—the latter to John her eldest son by her first marriage with Bosschaert of Avesnes, and the former to Guy of Dampierre, a son of her second marriage with William of Dampierre, a French nobleman. The government of Guy proved an unfortunate one:

Flanders was involved in a severe struggle with France, and for a time almost lost its independence. The old count died at Compiègne in prison about two months after peace was concluded in 1305; and Robert of Bethune, his son, was acknowledged his successor both by the Flemings and by the French. Robert was an able and valiant prince, and has the honour of having established at Bruges the first insurance company. The reign of his grandson and successor Louis of Nevers and Rethel, who had been brought up at the French court and married to Margaret the French king’s daughter, was rendered for ever memorable by the enterprise of Jacob van Artevelde, the great hero of Flemish liberty. Louis perished in the battle of Crecy, and left his county to his son Louis II. of Male, near Bruges, under whom the struggle of the Flemish towns for their liberties was maintained. By the marriage of Louis’s daughter Margaret with Philip of Burgundy, the lordship of Flanders passed to the Burgundian family; and thus it ultimately became part of, the possessions of the house of Austria. The title of count of Flanders has been borne since 1840 by the second son of Leopold I. of Belgium, Philip Eugene Ferdinand.
