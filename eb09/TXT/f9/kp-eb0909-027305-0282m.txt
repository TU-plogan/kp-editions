FIX, Theodore (1800-1846), a French journalist and political economist, was born at Soleure in Switzerland in 1800. His father was a French physician who had been expatriated by the edict of Nantes. Young Fix adopted at first the profession of a land surveyor, but, tiring of the monotony of this employment, he in 1830 became connected with the Bulletin Universel des Sciences, to which he contributed most of the geographical articles. In 1833 he [9:9:274] founded the Revue mensuelle d' Économie Politique, which he continued till 1836. He also contributed to Le Siècle, La Quotidienne, Le Journal des Économistes, and La Revue Nouvelle. An article of his in the August number of the Revue Nouvelle for 1846, on the religious condition of Germany, attracted considerable attention. His principal work is Observations sur les Classes Ouvrières, 1846, in which he argues against all attempts to regulate artificially the rate of wages. His pamphlet on L ’ Association des Douanes Allemandes was in 1840 crowned by the Academy of Sciences, but has not been published. He died suddenly at Paris 31st July 1846.
