FOKSHAN, or Fokshani, a town of Roumania, is situated 104 miles N.E. of Bucharest on the river Milkov, which forms the boundary line between Wallachia and Moldavia—the larger portion of the town being in Wallachia. It possesses a normal school, and is the seat of a prefecture and of a criminal and district court of justice. It has a considerable trade in corn with Galatz, and is in the vicinity of the district which produces the best Moldavian wine. A congress between Russian and Turkish diplomatists was held near the town in 1772. In the neighbourhood the Turks suffered a severe defeat from the Austrians and Russians in 1789. The population in 1873 was 20,323.
