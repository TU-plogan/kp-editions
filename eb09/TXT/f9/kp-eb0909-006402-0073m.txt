FEITH, Rhijnvis (1753-1824), a Dutch poet, was of aristocratic extraction, and was born at Zwolle, the capital of the province Overijssel, on the 7th of February 1753. It has been said with truth that his whole life was a model of social, personal, and literary good fortune; there has never lived a poet who enjoyed more unbroken prosperity. This is the more noticeable, because of all the important writers of Holland he is the one whose works are most full of melancholy and despair. He was educated at the universities of Harderwijk and Leyden, and took his degree at the latter in 1770. In 1772 he settled at his birthplace, and married. In 1780, in his twenty-seventh year, he became burgomaster of Zwolle, a post which he held for the remainder· of his life. He built a luxurious villa, which he named Boschwijk, in the outskirts of the town, and here he lived in the greatest comfort. His first important production was Julia, in 1783, a novel written in emulation of Werther, and positively steeped in Weltschmerz and despair. This was followed in 1784 by the tragedy of Thirsa, the first of his dramatic poems. The next year was one of great mark in Feith’s career: he published Ferdinand and Constantia, another Werther novel, and The Patriots, a tragedy. Both were very successful, and his poems were publicly crowned at Leyden. He was now the most popular poet in Holland, and this fact, combined with his burning patriotism, drew upon him the hatred of Bilderdijk. Other writers attacked his morbid melancholy, and in 1786 the critic Baron van Perponcher made a trenchant assault on him in a work on sentimentality. He was accordingly silent for some time, but in 1791 lie printed a tragedy of Lady Johanna Cray; and in 1792 there appeared a portentous didactic poem, The Grave, in four cantos, which belongs to the most tearful school of churchyard poetry. In 1793 and in 1795 he produced his tragedies of Ines de Castro and Mucius Cordus, the first taken from an episode in the L·usiad, the second composed in honour of the Batavian republic. From 1796 to 1814 appeared five volumes of Odes and Miscellaneous Poems. In 1802 he published another didactic poem, Old Age, in six cantos, and in 1804 Poems for Public Worship. He died on the 6th of February 1824. The next year a statue of the poet, the work of Gabriel, was erected in Zwolle, and an edition of his poetical works issued in thirteen volumes. As one of the most prominent members of the revival of Dutch letters, and as a fluent and careful verse-writer, Feith will always be honourably remembered. His own age accounted him one of the greatest of poets, but posterity has refused to endorse this judgment. His romantic inspiration was borrowed from Germany, and he did not hesitate to imitate Goethe, Wieland, and Novalis. It must be recollected, however, that these men were his immediate contemporaries, and that he showed great alacrity and acumen in perceiving the modern direction of their genius.
