FLAMEN, a Roman sacrificial priest. The flamens were under the direction of the pontifices, and were consecrated to the service of some particular deity. The highest in rank were the Flamen Dialis, Flamen Martialis, and Flamen Quirinalis, who were always selected from among the patricians. When the number of flamens was raised from three to fifteen, those already mentioned were entitled majores, in contradistinction to the other twelve, who were called minores, and were chosen from the plebs. The flamens were held to be elected for life, but they might be compelled to resign office for neglect of duty, or on the occurrence of some ill-omened event during the performance of their rites. The official dress of the flamens w as the apex or cap (surmounted with a piece of pointed olive-wood, round the base of which a lock of wool^[1. Filum, whence, according to Varro and Festus, the name flamen, “quasi filamen,” was derived. ] was twisted), the lcena or mantle, and a laurel wreath. The highest of all these priests was the Flamen Dialis, or flamen of Jupiter, who in virtue of his office was entitled to a lictor, to a seat in the senate, to a curule chair, and to the toga praetexta, woven by his wife of thick wool. The sight of fetters being forbidden him, his toga was not allowed to be tied in a knot but was fastened by means of clasps, and the only kind of ring permitted to be worn on his finger was a broken one. If a person in fetters took refuge in his house he was immediately loosed from his bonds; and if a criminal on his way to the scene of his punishment met him and threw himself at his feet he was respited for that [9:9:286] day. The flamen Dialis was not allowed to leave the city for a single night, to ride or even touch a horse (a restriction which incapacitated him for the consulship), to swear an oath, to look at an army, or to witness the business of daily life. His marriage was dissoluble only by death. His wife was called Flaminica, and was obliged to assist her husband at the sacrifices and other religious duties which he performed. She wore long woollen robes, a purple veil, and shoes made of the leather of sacrificed animals, and like her husband she carried the sacrificial knife. Some of the municipal towns in Italy had flamens as well as Rome. When it became customary to deify the emperors, flamens were appointed in all the provincial towns to superintend their worship.
