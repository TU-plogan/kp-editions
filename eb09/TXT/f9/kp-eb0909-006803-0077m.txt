FELT is a fabric which results from the matting and intimate adhesion of fibrous materials among themselves, and is not, like ordinary cloth, produced by any spinning and weaving processes. All ordinary textile fibres possess sufficient adhesive tendency to enable them to be handled for spinning; but it is only in certain animal fibres that the peculiarity is so marked as to fit them for felting. The property results chiefly from the serrated or jagged structure of wool and hair, and efficient felting is also promoted by the crimped or wavy form which some fibres naturally assume. These properties are best developed in the short “carding” wool of such sheep as the merino and Saxony breeds, long “combing” wools possessing them in a less degree. Unwashed wool, being coated with the natural grease, does not felt. The hair of other animals, as of the rabbit, hare, coypu, vicugna, musquash, and ox, is employed for making felt of various kinds and for different purposes. Felt has been made and used from the most remote antiquity, and indeed, considering the simplicity of the material and the readiness with which wool felts, it is quite probable that it was known before woven fabrics. From time immemorial it has been employed for clothing and tent covers by the tribes of Central Asia, and to the present day it remains in extensive use among the Circassian, Armenian, and Tartar tribes. It is mentioned by Xenophon and Pliny, and Marco Polo describes its manufacture and applications in Central Asia. Felting results from combined pressure and moisture, and is favoured by heat. Ordinary broad-cloth and all “fulled” woollen textures are partly felted, the fulling process having for its object a partial felting of the previously woven material; and the shrinking of woollen garments after washing, with which all are familiar, results from a felting by which the fibres draw closer together, the cloth gaining in thickness and solidity what it loses in superficial extent. The applications of felt are numerous, a certain range of qualities being used for clothing, domestic, and upholstery purposes, while other and generally rougher felts are employed for mechanical appliances. The manufacture of felt hats constitutes its most extensive application, for which see the article Hat. Its manufacture in the form of carpets, drugget, table covers, and articles of clothing is also important and extensive. The felt for these purposes is made chiefly from wool, which is, after washing, first carded out into exceedingly fine uniform gossamer-like laps. These laps, of the length and breadth of the web to be made, are superimposed on each other in numbers corresponding to the thickness desired in the finished article. The superficial stratum is usually of finer texture than the body, and the mass when ready for felting has the appearance of a huge sheet of cotton wadding. In this state the compound lap is passed between a series of opposite pressing rollers partly immersed in water, some of which are solid and heavy and others hollow and heated internally by steam. In its progress the lap is not only squeezed between the rollers, but an oscillating motion being given to the upper series, it is at the same time submitted to a rubbing action, the result being that it issues a dense compact sheet of felt of uniform thickness. Felt so made is subsequently dyed, printed, and otherwise finished by the ordinary processes applicable to woven tissues. A patent has recently been secured for a carpet made of uniform strips of felt set on edge and tightly laced [9:9:69] through the centre. Such a carpet is the same on both sides, and for it great durability, thickness, softness, and elasticity are claimed. Among the leading mechanical applications of felt may be enumerated the covering of steam boilers and cylinders, the lining of damp walls, steampacking, non-conductors for kilns and refrigerators, filters, polishing wheels, lining between the planking and metal sheathing of ships, printers’ blankets, and the covering of roofs. In the coarser qualities of felt cow-hair is the leading ingredient, and waterproof felting for roofs, <fcc., is impregnated with artificial asphalt and like substances. This manufacture was originally introduced by Croggon and Co. of London under a patent of Dr Ritchie of Belfast; but the “roofing felt” now made is a misnomer, seeing it is a bituminous compound simply held together by waste flax and other vegetable fibres.
