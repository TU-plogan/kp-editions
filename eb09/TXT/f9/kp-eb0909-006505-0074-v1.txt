FELIX, the name of several popes.

Felix I., a Roman by birth, succeeded Dionysius in the papal chair in December 269. Regarding his pontificate there is little authentic information, but he is said to have given ecclesiastical sanction to the yearly celebration of the mass over the graves of the martyrs, a custom, however, which had been previously in existence; and the law regarding the consecration of churches is also ascribed to him. On account, it is said, of his having strongly supported the Christians during the persecutions under Aurelius, he was enrolled among the martyrs, his day being the 20th of May. He died in 274. A fragment of a letter to Maximus, bishop of Alexandria, in support of the doctrines of the Trinity and Incarnation against the arguments of Paul of Samosata, was in all probability written by Felix, but other three letters ascribed to him are certainly ungenuine.

Felix II. (Ί), pope or antipope, was in 356 raised from the archdeaconate of Rome to the papal chair, when Tiberius was banished by the emperor Constantius for refusing to subscribe the sentence of condemnation against Athanasius. His election was contrary to the wishes both of the clergy and of the people, and the consecration ceremony was performed by certain prelates belonging to the court In 357 Constantius, at the urgent request of an influential deputation of Roman ladies, agreed to the release of Tiberius on condition that he signed the semi-Arian creed. Constantius also issued an edict to the effect that the two bishops should rule conjointly, but Tiberius, on his entrance into Rome in the following year, was received by all classes with so much enthusiasm that Felix found it necessary to retire at once from Rome. Regarding the remainder of his life little is known, and the accounts handed down are contradictory, but he appears to have spent the most of it in retirement at his estate near Porto. He died in 365, and, on what grounds it is impossible to determine, was enrolled amongst the number of martyrs, his day being the 2 2d of July. In the reign of Gregory XIIL the claims of Felix to rank among the popes was discussed, and in order to discover whether any miraculous help was to be found to aid in the decision of the question his sarcophagus wa3 opened, when it is said the words “Pope and Martyr” were found inscribed on his body; but this supernatural testimony is in contradiction to the earlier authorities of the church.

Felix III. (or II.) was descended from one of the most influential families of Rome, and succeeded Simplicius in the papal chair 2d March 483. His first act was to repudiate the Henoticon, a deed of union, originating, it is supposed, with Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, and published by the emperor Zeno with the view of allaying the strife between the Monophysites and their opponents in the Eastern church. He also addressed a letter of remonstrance to Acacius; but the latter proved refractory, and sentence of deposition was passed against him. As Acacius, however, had the support of the emperor, a schism (the first on record) arose between the Eastern and Western churches, which lasted for 34 years. Felix died in 492.

Felix IV. (or III.), a native of Beneventum, was, on the death of John in 526, raised to the papal chair by the emperor Theodoric in opposition to the wishes of the clergy and people. His election was followed by serious riots, which were only quieted by the explanation of Theodoric that he had merely interposed his authority on account of the strifes of the ecclesiastical factions, and by his promise that in future the election should be vested in the clergy and people, although the confirmation of the emperor should also be required to render it valid. Felix, after an uneventful pontificate of four years, died in September 530.

Felix V. (or IV). See Amadeus VIII.
