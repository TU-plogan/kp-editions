FREISING, Freysing, or Freisingen, a town of Bavaria, district of Upper Bavaria, is situated on the lsar, 20 miles N.N.E. of Munich. It has breweries, distilleries, dyeworks, sawmills, and machine factories. Among the principal buildings are the cathedral (famous for its crypt), erected in the end of the 12th century, the town-hall, the lyceum, and the gymnasium. Freising is a very ancient town, and is said to have been founded by the Romans. It at any rate existed as early as 444 a.d., and was made the seat of a bishop in 724. In 1802 the bishopric was united to the newly-created archbishopric of Munich, whose occupant bears the title of Freising as well as Munich. The population of Freising in 1875 was 8252.
