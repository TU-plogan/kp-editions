FRAAS, Karl Nikolas (1810-1875), a German botanist and agriculturist, was born at Stettelsdorf, near Bamberg, 8th September 1810. After receiving his preliminary education at the gymnasium of Bamberg, he in 1830 entered the university of Munich, where he took his doctor’s degree in 1834. Having devoted great attention to the study of botany, he went to Athens in 1835 as inspector of the court garden; and in April 1836 he became professor of botany at the university. In 1842 he returned to Germany and became teacher at the central agricultural school at Schleissheim. In 1847 he was appointed professor of agriculture at Munich, and in 1851 director of the central veterinary college. For many years he was secretary of the Agricultural Society of Bavaria, but resigned in 1861. He died at his estate of Neufreimann near Munich, 9th November 1875. Besides his important contributions to the sciences of botany and agriculture, Fraas devoted much of his effort to improve the condition of the peasants.
