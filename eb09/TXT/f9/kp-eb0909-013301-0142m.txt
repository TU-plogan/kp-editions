FIBRIN, or Fibrine, is a member of the important group of albuminoid or proteinous substances which, embracing albumen, casein, gluten, and other allied compounds, con-gtitute[9:9:134] essential principles of animal and of the higher vegetable organisms. The substances are distinguished among themselves more by physical peculiarities and properties than by distinctions of chemical constitution, which, indeed, is so variable as to point to the conclusion that the various principles are not to be regarded as definite chemical compounds. In a physiological sense fibrin results from the union of two albuminoids which exist separately in the blood, fibrinogen and the fibrinoplastic substance. The body is most readily obtained by lashing blood-clot with a loose bundle of twigs, when the substance will attach itself to the twigs in a filamentous condition. On being purified by washing with water, it forms a soft elastic transparent or whitish mass of filaments, which have no tendency to cohere. When permitted to dry in the air it becomes a hard homy mass, with a yellowish or greenish tinge. Fibrin is quite insoluble in water, but boiled under pressure, or with long continued boiling, it dissolves with a change of its structure. It is unaffected by alcohol or ether, but in presence of dilute acids and weak alkalies it is gradually dissolved. Its average percentage composition is thus stated :—Carbon 52 ’ 6, hydrogen 7*6, nitrogen 17 ’ 4, oxygen 21‘8, sulphur 1 ’ 2. The analogous product obtained from muscular tissue is termed syntonin. Vegetable fibrin is that portion of the nitrogenous constituents of cereal grains and similar seeds which is insoluble in alcohol. Fibrin, although a substance of the highest physiological interest, and of the utmost importance as a constituent of food, has hitherto, unlike albumen, casein, and gluten, found no special application as a separate industrial product.
