FLOREZ, Enrique (1701-1773), a Spanish historical scholar, was born at Valladolid in 1701. In his fifteenth year he entered the order of St Augustine, professed theology at the university of Alcala, and published a Cursus Theologice in 5 vols, .4to (1732-1738). He afterwards devoted himself exclusively to historical studies. Of these the first fruit was his Clave Historial, a work of the same class as the French Art de Verifier les Dates, and preceding it by several years. It appeared in 1743, and passed through many editions. In 1747 was published the first volume of La España Sagrada, a vast compilation of local ecclesiastical history which obtained a European reputation, aud of which 29 volumes appeared in the author’s lifetime. It was continued after his death by Fathers Risco and Fernandez, and further additions have been made at the expense of the Spanish Government. The value of the work is considerably increased by the insertion of ancient chronicles and documents not easily accessible elsewhere. Florez was a good numismatist, and published España Carpetana; Medalias delas Colonias, in 2 vols. 4to (1757- 1758). A third volume appeared in 1773. His last work was the Memorias de las reynas Catolicas, 2 vols. 4to (1770). Florez led a retired, studious, and unambitious life, and died at Madrid in May or August 1773.
