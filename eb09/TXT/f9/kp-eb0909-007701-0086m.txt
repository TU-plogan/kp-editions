FEOFFMENT, in English law, was the form of granting or conveying a freehold or fee. One of its essential elements was livery of seisin (delivery of possession), which consisted in formally giving to the feoffee on the land a clod or turf, or a growing twig, as a symbol of the transfer of the land. This was called livery in deed. Livery in law •WA made not on but iu sight of this land, the feoffer saying to the feoffee, “I give you that land; enter and take possession.” By the 8 and 9 Viet c. 106 feoffments were rendered unnecessary and superfluous. All corporeal hereditaments were by that Act declared to be in grant as well as livery, i.e., they could be granted by deed without livery. And feoffments were in general required to be evidenced by deed.
