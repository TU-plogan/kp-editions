FÉLIBIEN, DomMichel (1666-1719), French historian, was a son of André, and was born at Chartres, September 14, 1666. After studying at the Collége des Bons-Enfants at Paris, he entered, at the age of sixteen, the Benedictine congregation of St Maur. He devoted himself to a studious life, and produced in 1706 the learned Histoire de VAbbaye royale de Saint-Denis en France. Drawn from original sources, and illustrated with engravings, it at once attracted attention, and made him a reputation as a scholar. He was soon after selected by Bignon, provost of the merchants of Paris, to write a history of that city, and notwithstanding his broken health he undertook the task. In 1713 he put forth his Projet Tune histoire de la ville de Paris, which was approved by Louis XIV. He steadily continued his labours for six years longer, but did not live to finish the work. He died at St Germain des Près, September 25, 1719. His History of Paris, which was far advanced, was completed by Lobineau assisted by De Varigny, former secretary to Félibien, and was published in 5 vols. fol. in 1725 (not 1755, as stated by most of the authorities). Dorn Michel was the author of several other works of less importance.
