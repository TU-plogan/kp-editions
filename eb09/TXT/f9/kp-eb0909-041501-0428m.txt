FORLIMPOPOLI, a town of Italy, about five miles east of Forlì, with a station on the railway between Bologna and Rimini. It was once a bishop’s seat, and still possesses a cathedral and an ancient castle. The name and the situation identify it with one of the three places that bore the Latin designation of Forum Popilii. Its history is marked by great vicissitudes. Destroyed by the Lombards and restored by the people of Forlì, it was again laid utterly waste in 1370 by Cardinal Egidio, and though twenty years later it was refounded and refortified by Sinbaldo Ordelaffi, it never recovered its former prosperity. Population in 1872 about 5000.
