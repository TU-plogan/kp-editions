FOND DU LAC, a city of the United States, capital of Fond du Lac county, Wisconsin, is beautifully situated on a rising ground at the southern end of Lake Winnebago, 63 miles N.W. of Milwaukee. Railways radiate from it in various directions, and its situation on Winnebago lake gives it access to a wide district of inland navigation. It has a considerable shipping trade in wood, hay, and cattle, and possesses a large tannery, foundries, sawmills, cigar factories, carriage and waggon factories, and a railwaycar factory. The water supply is obtained chiefly from Artesian wells, which vary in depth from 90 to 130 feet. The population in 1860 was 5400, and in 1870, 12,764.
