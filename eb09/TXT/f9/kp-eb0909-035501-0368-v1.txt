FOLARD, Jean Charles de (1669-1752), a French writer on military tactics, was born at Avignon, 13th February 1669. His military ardour was first awakened by reading Caesar’s Commentaries, and became so strong that he twice made his escape from parental control, the second time being successful in obtaining the fulfilment of his wishes. When he joined the army he was only sixteen years of age, but the zeal with which he studied the scientific department of his profession soon brought him into notice, and in 1702 he became aide-de-camp to the duke of Vendome, who was then in command of the French forces in Italy. For his services with the duke’s brother in Lombardy in 1705 Folard received the cross of St Louis, and in the same year he distinguished himself at the battle of Cassano, where he was severely wounded. In 1706 he defended Modena against Prince Eugene. He was dangerously wounded at the battle of Malplaquet, and a few months afterwards was taken prisoner by the Austrians. In 1711 he was appointed governor of Bourbourg, and he afterwards entered the service of Charles XII. of Sweden, and accompanied him in the invasion of Norway; but after the death of Charles he returned to France, and served as colonel in the Spanish campaign of the duke of Berwick. On the conclusion of peace he applied himself with renewed diligence to the study of military tactics, and expounded his views in the following works :— Nouvelles Découvertes sur la Guerre, 1724; Commentaires sur Polybe, 1727; and Fonctions et Devoirs d'un Officier de Cavalrie, 1733. The system of column formation advocated by Folard, and many of his other opinions, have met with nothing but ridicule from tacticians; but Frederick the Great, while condemning his general system of tactics, nevertheless published an abridgment of his works, under the title of Esprit du Chevalier Folard, 1761, in the preface to which he expressed a high opinion of the sagacity of Folard’s criticism of certain French generals, strongly recommended many of his tactical rules and methods of defence, and admitted that even in his most visionary plans hints were to be found very valuable and suggestive. Folard died at Avignon in 1752.
