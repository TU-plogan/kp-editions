FUCHS, Johann Nepomuk von (1774-1856), an eminent chemist and mineralogist, was born at Mattenzell, near Bromberg, in the neighbourhood of the Baieriscber [9:9:806] Wald, May 15, 1774. Having acquired a knowledge of medicine at Vienna and Heidelberg, he in 1801 turned his attention to chemistry and mineralogy, which he studied at Freiberg, Berlin, and Faris. In 1807 he became professor of those sciences at the university of Landshut, and in 1823 conservator of the mineralogical collections at Munich, where, on the occasion of the removal thither of the university of Landshut, in 1826 he was appointed professor of mineralogy. In 1852 he retired from public life, and in 1854 he was raised to the nobility by the king of Bavaria. He died at Munich, March 5, 1856. Mineralogy and inorganic chemistry are indebted to Fuchs for numerous researches. He is more especially known for his discovery, in 1823, of a process for making a soluble glass, used for fixing fresco-colours, according to the method termed stereochromy. Among his works areâ€”
