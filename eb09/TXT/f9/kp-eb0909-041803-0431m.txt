FORSKAL, Peter (1736-1763), a celebrated Oriental traveller and naturalist, was born in Sweden in 1736. He studied at Göttingen, where he published a dissertation entitled Dubia de Principiis Philosophice Recentioris, which gained him some reputation. Thence he returned to his native country; but in 175st he alienated the good-will of the Government by the publication of a pamphlet entitled Pensées sur la Liberté Civile. His acquaintance with natural history, however, had gained him the friendship of Linnaeus, who recommended him to Frederick V. of Denmark. From that sovereign he obtained the title of professor at Copenhagen, and Frederick also appointed him to accompany Carsten Niebuhr in an expedition to investigate Arabia and Egypt. He died of the plague at Jerim in Arabia, July 11, 1763. His friend and companion Niebuhr was entrusted with the care of editing his MSS., and published in 1775 Descriptiones Animalium, Avium, Amphibiorum, Piscium, Insectorum, Vermium, quoe in itin. Orient, observavit Petrus Forskal. In the same year appeared also an account of the plants of Arabia Felix and of Lower Egypt, under the title of Aegyptiaco-Arabica, which is important as containing the first discussion of the relation of vegetation to climate.
