FARMER, Richard, (1735-1797), the Shakespearian commentator, was bom at Leicester in 1735. He was educated first at the free grammar school of his native town, and afterwards at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, of which in 1760 he became classical tutor, and in 1775 master, in succession to Dr Richardson, the biographer of the English bishops. In the latter year also he was appointed vice-chancellor, and three years afterwards chief librarian of the university. In 1780 he was appointed to aprebendal stall in Lichfield, and in about two years more to one at Canterbury; but the second office he exchanged in 1788 for that of a canon residentiary of St Paul’s. Cambridge, where he usually resided, was indebted to him for improvements in lighting, paving, and watching; but perhaps London and the nation have less reason to be grateful for his zealous advocacy of the custom of erecting monuments to departed worthies in St Paul’s. In 1765 he issued a prospectus for a history of the town of Leicester; but this work, based on materials collected by Thomas Staveley, he never even began; it was finished by the learned printer John Nichols. In the year after the publication of his Leicester “proposal” he gave to the world his famous Essay on the learning of Shakespeare, in which he proved that the bard’s acquaintance with ancient and modern Continental literature was exclusively derived from translations, of which he copied even the blunders. “Shakespeare,” he said, “wanted not the stilts of language to raise him above all other men.” “He came out of nature’s hand, like Pallas out of Jove’s head, at full growth and mature.” “One might,” he said—by way of ridiculing the Shakespearian criticism of the day—“with equal wisdom, study the Talmud for an exposition of Tristram Shandy.” For wealth of information, terseness of language, and force of demonstration, the essay is unsurpassed by any work of the kind. It fully justifies the author’s description of himself in the preface to the second edition, “I may consider myself as the pioneer of the commentators; I have removed a deal of learned rubbish, and pointed out to them Shakespeare’s track in the ever pleasant paths of nature.” Farmer died at Cambridge on the 8th September 1797. He was, it appears, twice offered a bishopric by Pitt, but declined the preferment. From all that is known of him it may be inferred that Farmer’s habits of life were scarcely compatible with episcopal reserve and dignity. He has been described as being more of a boon companion than a clergyman; and for a clergyman, he was too intimate with the play-house, on Shakespearian occasions especially.
