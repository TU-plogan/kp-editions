FELEGYHÄZA, chief town of the former district of Little Cumania, in Hungary, about 66 miles S.E of Pesth, 46° 4Γ N. lat., 19° 52' E. long., is advantageously situated on the railroad between Pesth and Szegedin. Amongst the principal edifices are a fine town-hall, a Roman Catholic gymnasium, and a large parish church. The surrounding country is covered with vineyards, fruit-gardens, and tobacco and corn fields, which are the principal source of employment to the inhabitants; but the town itself is chiefly noted for its great cattle-market. Numerous ancient Roman urns and other relics have been dug up in the vicinity of the town. In the 17th century Félegyhâza was completely destroyed by the Turks, nor was it recolonized and rebuilt till 1743. The population, by the latest census (December 31, 1869), amounted to 21,313, chiefly Roman Catholics and by nationality Magyars.
