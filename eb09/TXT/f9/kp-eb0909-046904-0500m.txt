FOSBROKE, Thomas Dudley (1770-1842), an English antiquary, was born in London, and was called Dudley after a cousin of that name, esquire of Lebotwood Hall in Shropshire. Fosbroke has given accounts of himself aud family in most of his works, accompanied with lists and statements of facts supporting possible alliances. He [9:9:470] was of an old Staffordshire family, no individual of which ever attained to any particular eminence. It had long been the custom in this family that one of the sons should enter the church, and the dying wish of the father in this case was that his son should take holy orders. Going to St Paul’s school at nine years of age, Fosbroke took in 1785 a Tesdale scholarship at Pembroke College, Oxford, and graduated as Μ. A. in 1792. In that year he took also deacon’s orders and settled in the curacy of Horsley in Gloucestershire, where he remained till 1810, taking priest’s orders in 1794. In 1810 Fosbroke removed to Walford in Herefordshire, and passed there the remainder of his life, as curate till 1830, and afterwards as vicar of the parish. In 1796 he published the Economy of Monastic Life, which is, according to his own account, “a poem in Spenserian measure and style, written upon Darwin’s doctrine of using only precise ideas of picturesque effect, chiefly founded on the sense of vision.” Whatever all that may mean the poem is entirely unreadable, although “the reviews were favourable.” This with other poetical attempts of Fosbroke’s was reprinted at the end of the third edition (1843) of his next book, the British Monachism, 2 vols. 8vo, 1802,—a compilation from manuscripts in the British Museum and Bodleian libraries, with subordinate use of printed authorities, of facts relating to the manners and customs of the monks and nuns of England, which was very favourably received. In the second and third editions this work was much enlarged. In 1799 Fosbroke had been elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and resolved to devote himself to the study of archaeology. British Monachism, the first result of his studies, was always his favourite work. In 1807 was published by subscription his Abstracts and Records of Manuscripts respecting the County of Gloucester, after which he entered into an engagement with Sir Richard Philips for several important works, including an encyclopaedia of antiquities; but owing to the commercial failure of that enterprising gentleman in 1810, these plans fell through. In 1814 he published an Abridgment of Whitby’s Commentary on the New Testament·, in 1819 a History of the City of Gloucester, from new materials; in 1818 The Wye Tour·, and in 1821 its companion, Ariconensia, or Archaeological Sketches of Ross and Archenfeld, illustrative of the Campaigns of Caractacus and the Station Ariconium. In 1821 also was issued his edition of the Berkeley Manuscripts, with a history of the castle and town of Berkeley and a life of Jenner. The w ork for which Fosbroke is best remembered, the Encyclopaedia of Antiquities, was first published in 1824, 2 vols. 4to; a second enlarged edition appeared in 1840. This work, though perhaps open to objection on account of a certain incoherence and disproportion, embodies the results of a large amount of reading among manuscript and other obscure sources. A sequel to this, called Foreign Topography, was published in 1828. His other works are A Picturesque and Topographical Account of Cheltenham and its Vicinity (1826); The Tourisfis Grammar, or Rules relating to the Scenery and Antiquities incident to Travellers (1826); “A Treatise on the Arts, <tc., of the Greeks and Romans” (1833), for Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia·, “Extracts from Manuscripts relating to English History,” and “Illustrations of the Constitution of our Ancient Parliaments,” contributed to the Transactions of the Royal Society of Literature, of which body Fosbroke was elected honorary associate in 1827. He also made extensive researches into the pedigree and history of the Clinton family at the desire of the duke of Newcastle, in the possession of whom three large folio volumes of his MSS. now remain. Fosbroke was in the early part of this century a regular contributor to the Genfileman’s Magazine of both original articles and reviews. Although without pretension to style as an author or judgment as a critic of antiquities, he was a student and writer of good aims; and despite a recurring tendency to whine at his fate in prefaces, his works can be read with some pleasure and profit. He died at Walford on the 1st January 1842.
