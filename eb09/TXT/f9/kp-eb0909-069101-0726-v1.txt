FRANCIS II. (1543-1560), king of France, eldest son of Henry II. and of Catherine de’ Medici, was born at Fontainebleau, 19th January 1543. He married the famous Mary Stuart, daughter of James V. of Scotland, 25th April 1558, and ascended the French throne 10th July 1559. During his short reign he was the mere tool of his uncles, the duke of Guise and the cardinal of Lorraine, into whose hands he virtually delivered the reins of government. The exclusiveness with which they were favoured, and their high-handed proceedings, awakened the resentment of the princes of the blood, Anthony king of Navarre and Louis prince of Condé, who gave their countenance to a conspiracy with the Protestants against the house of Guise. It was, however, discovered shortly before the time fixed for its execution in March 1560, and an ambush having been prepared, most of the conspirators were either killed or taken prisoners. Its leadership and organization had been entrusted to Godfrey du Barry, lord of la Renaudie; and the prince of Condé, who was not present, disavowed all connexion with the plot. The duke of Guise was now named lieutenant-general of the kingdom, but his Catholic leanings were somewhat held in check by the chancellor Michel de ΓHopital, through whose mediation the edict of Romorantin, providing that all cases of heresy should be decided by the bishops, was passed in May 1560, in opposition to a proposal to introduce the Inquisition. At a meeting of the states-general held at Orleans in the December following, the prince of Condé, after being arrested, was condemned to death, and extreme measures were being enacted against the Huguenots; but the deliberations of the Assembly were broken off, and the prince saved from execution, by the king’s somewhat sudden death, on the 5th of the month, from an abscess in the ear.
