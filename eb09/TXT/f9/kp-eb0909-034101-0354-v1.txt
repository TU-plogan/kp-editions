FLORIDA-BLANCA, Don Jose Monino y Redondo, Count of (1728-1808), Spanish statesman, was born at Murcia in 1728. He was the son of a notary, and received a good education, which he completed at the university of Salamanca, especially applying himself to the study of law. For a time he followed the profession of an advocate, and acquired a high reputation. A more public career was opened to him by the marquis of Esquilache, then chief minister of state, who sent him ambassador to Pope Clement XIV. Successful in his mission, he was soon after appointed by Charles III. successor to his patron, and his administration was one of the most brilliant Spain had ever seen. He regulated the police of Madrid, reformed many abuses, projected canals, established many societies of agriculture and economy, and many philanthropical institutions, and gave encouragement to learning, science, and the fine arts. Commerce flourished anew under his rule, and the long-standing disputes with Portugal about the South American colonies were settled. He sought to strengthen the alliance of Spain with Portugal by a double marriage between the members of the royal houses, designing by this arrangement to place ultimately a Spanish prince on the throne of Portugal. But in this he failed. His attacks on Algiers in 1775, and on Gibraltar in 1782, cost Spain the loss of nearly 80,000 men. He dealt a heavy blow to the Cortes, prevailing upon them by various forms of bribery, and by sowing dissension among the members, to proclaim the heir to the throne without making the customary assertion of their privileges. He retained his office for three years under Charles IV.; but in 1792, through the influence of his enemies, he was dismissed and imprisoned in the castle of Pampeluna. Here he was saved from starvation only by the intervention of his brother. He was afterwards allowed to retire to his estates, and remained in seclusion till the French invasion of 1808. He was then called by his countrymen to take the presidency of the central junta. But his strength failed him, and he died at Seville, November 20 of the same year. He left several short treatises on jurisprudence.
