FLYING FOX, or more correctly Fox Bat, a name applied to a family of fruit-eating bats (Pteropidae), found only in the Eastern hemisphere, and there confined to the tropical regions and Australia. It comprises 9 genera and 65 species, a considerable proportion of which occur in the islands of the Malay Archipelago. They are also found throughout Africa, and extend northward and eastward to China and Japan, and southward to Tasmania. They are likewise included among the few indigenous mammals of the South Sea Islands, being found in Samoa and the Marianne Islands. The flying foxes are the largest of the bats, the kalong of Java (Pteropus edulis) measuring nearly a foot and a half in length, and having an expanse of wing-mem [9:9:353] brane measuring nearly five feet across. The flesh of this species is esteemed a delicacy in many parts of Malaya; but its use in this respect by no means compensates for the enormous amount of fruit which it destroys. The flying foxes are gregarious, nocturnal animals, suspending themselves during the day head downwards by thousands from the branches of trees, where with their wings gathered about them, they bear some resemblance to huge shrivelled-up leaves, or to clusters of some peculiar fruit. In Batchian, according to Wallace, they suspend themselves chiefly from the branches of dead trees, where they are easily caught or knocked down by sticks, the natives carrying them home in basketfuls. They are then cooked with abundance of spices, and “are really very good eating, something liko hare.” Towards evening these bats bestir themselves, and fly off in companies to the village plantations, where they feed on all kinds of fruit, and so numerous and voracious are they, that no garden crop has much chance of being gathered which is not specially protected from their attacks. The flying fox of India (JPteropus medius) is a smaller species, but is found in great numbers wherever fruit is to be had in the Indian peninsula. Of this species Mr Francis Day, who has had special opportunities of studying it, says —“In their diet they are exclusively frugivorous, and they do very great injury to cocoa-nut plantations and mango gardens. Their habits are very intemperate; and they often pass the night drinking the toddy from the chatties in the cocoa-nut trees, which results either in their returning home in the early morning in a state of extreme and riotous intoxication, or in being found the next day at the foot of the trees sleeping off the effects of their midnight debauch.” No fossil fox-bats have yet been found.
