FRANCONIA, in German Franken, a name of very different application in different historical periods. It properly signifies the land of the Franks, and is consequently identical in original meaning with the word Francia or France. In the beginning of the 4th century the Frankish territory stretched from the Loire eastward to the basin of the Rhine and the Main; but it was shortly afterwards broken up into two divisions—Austrasia, Francia Orientalis, or the kingdom of the East Franks,and Neustria, Francia Occidentalis, or the kingdom of the West Franks. As time went on both kingdoms extended their boundaries; and when the treaty of Verdun in 845 settled the claims of the grandsons of Charles the Great, there was a kingdom of Western France with Latin tendencies, and a kingdom of Eastern France with Teutonic tendencies, each possessing a central district or duchy of its own name. These districts were separated from each other by the district of Lotharingia or Lorraine. The western was soon after lost sight of; but the eastern continued for a long period to be considered the very core and kernel of the German kingdom, and a theory became prevalent that it was the original seat of the Franks in Germany. Under the Saxon and Franconian emperors it was subdivided into Ost-Franken, Francia Orientalis, or Eastern Franconia par excellence, and Rhein-Franken, Francia Rhenensis, or Rhenish Franconia. The former, which was also distinguished as Saal-Frunken, stretched from the Fichtelgebirge and the Rhone to the Danube, and from the Upper Palatinate to the Spessart and the lands of the Neckar; while the latter was the country between the Spessart and [9:9:704] the Rhine, and included the present district of Frankfort-onthe-Main. Though the name frequently occurs in our histories, there was probably no proper “duchy” of Franconia, in the same sense at least as there was a duchy of Saxony or a duchy of Bavaria. Conrad I. and Conrad II., for example, do not style themselves dukes “of” Franconia but dukes “in” Franconia. Both Eastern Franconia and Rhenish Franconia were broken up into a number of distinct territories—countships, lordships, &c. When Maximilian divided Germany into circles in 1501, he gave the name of Franconia to the circle whichincluded the bishoprics of Würzburg, Bamberg, and Eichstädt, the district of Mergentheim belonging to the grand master of the Teutonic Order, the territory of the abbey of Schönthal, the principalities of Baireuth and Ansbach, the countships of Henneberg and Schwarzenberg, the territories of the curia of Franconian counts, the imperial towns of Nuremberg, Rothenburg, Schweinfurt, Weissenburg, and Windsheim. Altogether the circle comprised 69 territories and had an area of about 10,430 square miles, and in 1792 its population amounted to 1,547,000. The name of Franconia ceased to be officially used after the dissolution of the German empire in 1806; but in 1837 King Louis I. of Bavaria gave the names of Upper, Middle, and Lower Franconia to what had previously been known as the circles of the Upper Main, the Rezat, and the LowerMain. Upper Franconia forms the north-east portion of Bavaria, and is partly conterminous with the frontiers of Bohemia, Saxony, and Prussia. Its mountains are the Fichtelgebirge, the Frankenwald, the Böhmerwald, and the Steigerwald; and the Main, the Naab, the Saale, and the Eger take their rise within its territory. The seat of the administration is at Baireuth, and the court of appeal at Bamberg. Lower Franconia lies to the west, and forms the north-west province of the kingdom,—conterminous with Prussia, Weimar, Meiningen, Würtemberg, Baden, and Hesse. Its rivers arc the Main, the Saale, the Itz, and the Baunach. The principal town is Würzburg. Middle Franconia lies to the south of the other two, conterminous with the Upper Palatinate, Swabia, and Würtemberg. It is watered by the Regnitz and the Altmühl. The principal town is Nuremberg, the seat of the administration is at Ausbach, and the court of appeal at Eichstädt.
