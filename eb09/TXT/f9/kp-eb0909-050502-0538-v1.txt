FRANÇAIS, Antoine, Count, better known as Français of Nantes, a French politician and author, was born at Beaurepaire in the department of Isère on January 17, 1756, and died at Paris, 7th March 1836. In 1791 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly by the department of Loire Inférieure, aud soon attained a high position among his fellow representatives; but he was not re-elected to the Convention. During the Reign of Terror he was obliged to seek safety in the mountains. In 1798 he was elected to the council of the Five Hundred, and became ono of its secretaries; and in the following year he voted against the Directory. He took office under the consulate as prefect of Charente Inférieure, rose to be a member of the council of state, and in 1804 obtained the important post of director-general of taxes. The value of his services was recognized by the titles of count of the empire and grand officer of the Legion of Honour. On the second restoration he retired into private life; but from 1819 to 1822 he was representative of the department of Isère, and after the July revolution he was made a peer of France.

Français wrote a number of works, but his name is more likely to be preserved by the eulogies of the literary men to whom ise afforded protection and assistance. It is sufficient to mention Le Manuscrit de feu Μ. Jérôme, 1825; Recueil de fadaises composé sur la montagne à l'usage des habitants de la plaine, 1826; Voyage dans la vallée des originaux, 1828; Tableau de la vie rurale, ou l’agriculture enseignée d'une manière dramatique, 1829.
