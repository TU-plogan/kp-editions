FLENSBURG, or Flensborg, the capital of a circle in the government district of Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia, is situated at the head of the Flensburg Ford, 20 miles north by west of Schleswig. It is the most important commercial town in what was formerly the duchy of Schleswig, and possesses several wharfs, a large shipbuilding yard, breweries, distilleries, foundries, oil-mills, sailcloth and paper manufactories, glass-works, copper works, soap-works, and rice-mills. It has a number of vessels engaged in the West India trade, and in the Greenland whale fishery; and it also carries on a considerable oyster trade. The principal public buildings are the market houses, the exchange, the theatre, the real school, the agricultural school, and the hospital. The cemetery is interesting as containing the remains of the Danish soldiers who fell in the battle of Idstedt (25th July 1850). A marble headstone has been placed at each grave—officers and common soldiers—with the same simple inscription on each, after the name and rank, “Fell at Idstedt.” The colossal Lion monument, erected by the Danes to commemorate the victory of Idstedt, was removed to Berlin in 1864. Flensburg was founded in the 12th century, and received the privileges of a town from King Waldemar in 1284. The population in 1875 was 26,525.
