FLOUNDER{Pleuronectes flesuf) is one of the most common Flat-fishes along the coasts of northern Europe, from the British Channel to Iceland. It is more partial to fresh water than any other Flat-fish, ascending rivers far beyond the reach of the tide, as, for instance, the Rhine as far as Cologne. It very rarely exceeds the length of twelve inches, and a weight of Impounds.
