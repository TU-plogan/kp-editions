From its situation on a rocky height it commands a splendid prospect of the surrounding country, including a fine view of the Adriatic Sea. It is surrounded by old walls, and besides the cathedral possesses numerous churches and convent3, a university, and two fine collections of statuary and paintings. The ruins of the ancient Roman town, which was destroyed in the 5th century, are still to be seen, [9:9:99] Lactantius and Galeazzo Sforza were born in Fermo.
