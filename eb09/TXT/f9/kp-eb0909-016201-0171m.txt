FILIBUSTER, a name first given to the buccaneers, a band of piratical adventurers who maintained themselves chiefly in the Caribbean seas during the 17th century (see Buccaneer). The origin of the term has been explained in two ways,â€”some deriving it from the English word flyboat, French flibot, Spanish flibote, a name given to a small vessel not exceeding 100 tons, which, on account of its sailing qualities, was much used by pirates, while others make it synonymous with the Dutch vry buiter, German freibeuter, English freebooter, the word changing first into fribustier, and then into French flibustier, Spanish filibustero. Flibustier has passed into the French language and filibustero into the Spanish language as a general name for a pirate, and the term filibuster was revived in America to designate those adventurers who, after the termination of the war between Mexico and the United States, organized expeditions within the United States against the Spanish West Indies.
