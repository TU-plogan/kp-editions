FREYCINET, Louis Claude Desaulses de (1779- 1842), French, navigator, was born at Montelimart in Dauphiny, August 7, 1779. In 1793 he entered the French navy. After taking part in several engagements against the English, he joined in 1800, along with his brother Henri Louis (1777-1840), who afterwards rose to the rank of admiral, the expedition sent out under Captain Baudin in the “Naturaliste” and “Géographe” to explore the south and south-west coasts of Australia. Much of the ground already gone over by Flinders was revisited, and new names imposed by this expedition, which claimed credit for discoveries really made by the English navigator (see Flinders). In 1805 Louis returned to Paris, and was entrusted by Government with the work of preparing the maps and plans of the expedition. In 1817 he commanded the “Uranie,” in which Arago and others went to Rio de Janeiro, to take a series of pendulum measurements. This was only part of a larger scheme for obtaining observations, not only in geography and ethnology, but in astronomy, terrestrial magnetism, and meteorology, and for the collection of specimens in natural history. For three years Freycinet cruised about, visiting Australia, the Marianne, Sandwich, and other Pacific islands, South America, and other places, returning to France, notwithstanding the loss of the “Uranie,” with fine collections in all departments of natural history, and with voluminous notes and drawings which form an important contribution to a knowledge of the countries visited. The results of this voyage were published under Freycinet’s supervision, with the title of Voyage Autour du Monde, &c., in 1825-44, in 8 quarto volumes, and several folio volumes of fine plates and maps. It has not, however, been completed. Freycinet was admitted into the Academy of Sciences in 1825, and was one of the founders of the Paris Geographical Society. He died August 18, 1842.
