FOSTER, Stephen Collins (1826-1864), a prolific American song and ballad writer, was born at Alleghany, Pennsylvania, July 4, 1826. He was the youngest child of a merchant who became mayor of his native city, and a member of the State legislature, and was related by marriage to President Buchanan. As a boy Stephen was delicate, and through life he was of a quiet retiring disposition—in strong contrast with the spirit of many of his most popular songs. He early showed talent for music, and played upon several instruments; he also acquired a fair knowledge of French and German. When thirteen years old he wrote a song afterwards published in his works —“Sadly to Mine Heart Appealing.” At sixteen he wrote the then much admired “Open thy Lattice, Love;” at seventeen he entered his brother’s business house, Cincinnati, Ohio, where he remained about three years, composing meanwhile such popular pieces as “Old Uncle Ned,” “O Susanna !” &c. For the latter he received 100 dollars, which induced him to adopt song-writing as a vocation. His chief successes were songs written for the negro melodists or “minstrels.” Besides those mentioned, the following attained great popularity, viz., “Nelly was a Lady,” “Old Kentucky Home,” “Old Folks at Home,” “Massa’s in the Cold Ground,” &c. For these and other songs the composer received considerable sums, “Old Folks at Home” bringing him, it is said, 15,000 dollars. For the most of his songs Foster wrote both words and music. His reputation rests chiefly on his negro melodies, many of which have been popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and sung in many tongues. His later songs were of a more refined and somewhat higher order of musical composition, and after his mother’s death were characterized by melancholy. Among these are “Old Dog Tray,” “Gentle Annie,” “Willie, we have missed you,” &c. His “Come where my Love lies Dreaming” is considered one of the most pleasing and popular vocal quartets ever written. Composers and poets of celebrity recognized his peculiar talent, and great musicians incorporated many of his melodies into concert fantasias. Although as a musician and composer Foster would, strictly speaking, have little claim to high rank, his song-writing made an epoch in popular music of a class which certainly possessed melody united to beauty of harmony, while to the words employed he gave fitting musical expression. He died at New York, January 13, 1864.
