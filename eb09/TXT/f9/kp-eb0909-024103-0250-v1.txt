FIROZPUR, or Ferozefore, a district of British India in the Lahore division or commissionership under the jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the Punjab, lies between 30° 18' 12'' and 31° 10' 36" N. lat., and 74° 5' and 75’ 29' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by Lahore, Amritsar, and Kapurthálá state, E. by Jalandhar and Ludhiána, S. by Patiála, Nabh<4, and Faridkot states, and W. by Sirsá. The surface of the district is level, with the exception of a few sand-hills in the south and south-east. The country consists of two distinct tracts, that liable to annual fertilizing inundations from the Sutlej, known as the bhet, and the rohi or upland tract The only river is the Sutlej, which runs along the north-western boundary. The census of 1868 returned the population at 303,489 males and 245,764 females—total 549,253, of whom 68,406 were Hindus, 245,659 Mahometans, 160,487 Hindus, and 74,701 “others.” The area of the district is 2740 square miles, or 1,753,250 acres, of which 1,243,508 are cultivated, 377,722 cultivable, and 132,020 uncultivable and waste. The principal crops are wheat, barley, millet, gram, pulses, oilseeds, cotton, tobacco, &c. The manufactures are of the humblest kind, consisting chiefly of cotton and wool-weaving, and are confined entirely to the supply of local wants.

The Lahore and Ludhiána road runs for 51 miles through the district, and forms the chief trade route. The chief town and administrative headquarters of the district is Firozpur. The other important towns and seats of commerce are Mahrág, population 5681; Dharmkot, 5379; Moga, 4844; Muktsar, 4694; and Zira, 3010. The district revenue in 1872-73 amounted to £61,141, of which £49,713 was derived directly from the land. For the protection of person and property there are 12 revenue and civil and 13 magisterial courts, a regular police force of 388 officers and men, a municipal police of 75 men, and a rural constabulary of 542 men. For educational purposes 121 schools, attended by 3487 pupils, are maintained or subsidized by the state, at a cost of £1299. Owing principally to the dryness of its climate, Firozpur has the reputation of being an exceptionally healthy district. In September and October, however, after the annual rains, the people suffer a good deal from remittent fever. The average annual rainfall is 20 ’ 9 inches. British rule was first established at Firozpur in 1835, when on the failure of heirs to the Sikh family who possessed it, a small territory 86 miles in extent became an escheat to the British Government, and the present district has been gradually formed around this nucleus. Firozpur was the scene of operations during the first Sikh war. The Sikhs crossed the Sutlej in December 1845, were defeated successively at Mudki, Firozsháh, Aliwál, and Sobráon; after which they withdrew into their own territory, and peace was concluded at Lahore. At the time of the mutiny, Firozpur cantonments contained two regiments of native infantry and a regiment of native cavalry, together with the 61st Foot, and two companies of European artillery. One of the native regiments, the 57th, was disarmed; but the other, the 45th, broke into mutiny, and, after an unsuccessful attempt to seize the magazine, which was held by the Europeans, proceeded to join the rebel forces in Delhi. Throughout the mutiny Firozpur remained in the hands of the English.

Firozpur, the civil headquarters of the district of the same name, also a military cantonment, is situated on the old bank of the Sutlej, in 30° 57' N. lat. and 74° 10' E. long. The city contains a population of 20,592, according to the census of 1868, of whom 7181 are Hindus, 11,171 Mahometans, 1347 Sikhs, and 893 “others.” It has been constituted a municipality of the second class; municipal income in 1872-73, £4033; expenditure, £3962; rate of taxation per head, 3s. lθjd. Firozpur has rapidy advanced in material prosperity of late years, and is now a very important seat of commerce. The main streets of the city are wide and well paved, and the whole is inclosed by a low brick wall. Great improvements have been made in the surroundings of the city. The cantonment lies two miles to the south of the city, and is connected with it by [9:9:242] a good metalled road. The garrison now consists of one regiment of British infantry, one of native infantry, one battery of field and one of garrison artillery. The arsenal to which Firozpur owes its political importance is situated one mile distant from cantonment. It is by far the largest in the province, and well stored with all munitions of war. The population of Firozpur cantonments and military lines amounted in 1868 to 15,837.
