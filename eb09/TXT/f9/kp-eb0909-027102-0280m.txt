FITZHERBERT, Sir Anthony, an eminent English lawyer, was born at Norbury. After studying at Oxford, he was called to the English bar, and in 1523 became justice of the court of common pleas, the duties of which office he continued to discharge till within a short time of his death in 1538. As a judge he left behind him a high reputation for fairness and integrity, and his legal learning is sufficiently attested by his published works.

He is the author of Le graunde abridgement, a digest of important legal cases written in Old French, first printed in 1524; The Office and Authority of Justices of the Peace, first printed in 1538, last ed. 1794; the New Natura Brevium, 1534, last ed. 1794, with a commentary ascribed to Sir Matthew Hale' and the Book of Husbandry, 1523, the first published work on agriculture in the English language.
