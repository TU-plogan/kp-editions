FLETCHER, Andrew (1653-1716), of Saltoun, a prominent figure in Scotch history during the latter half of the 17th century, was born in 1653 at his ancestral home in East Lothian, and for five years was taught by the celebrated Gilbert Burnet, who was then minister of the parish of Saltoun. On reaching manhood he visited the Continent, where he spent several years in travel and study. In 1681 be was returned as commissioner for his native county to the Scottish parliament, where he distinguished himself by such determined opposition to the arbitrary measures of the court that he was forced to seek refuge in Holland, while sentence of outlawry (with confiscation of his estates) was passed against him. Four years later he joined the expedition of the duke of Monmouth; but on their landing at Lyme in Dorsetshire, he had the misfortune to kill the mayor of the town in a quarrel, and was compelled once more to seek safety abroad. During the second period of exile he travelled in disguise through Spain, where he had some romantic adventures. He next made a tour through Hungary, where he fought as a volunteer in a Turkish campaign; and finally at the Hague he took an active part in forwarding the scheme of the English Revolution. In 1688 he returned to Scotland when he at once regained his estates, and also sat as a member in the Scottish convention and afterwards in the parliament. An enemy of the monarchical form of government, he began to oppose the ministry of William almost as stoutly as he had resisted that of Charles; and that he exercised power in parliament is shown by the triumphant passing of the Act of Security of 1703, which, ripened under his care, contained two important constitutional laws restraining the power of the monarch of making war without the consent of parliament, and providing that all places and offices should be given by parliament. During the years of negotiations, as leader of the national party, he was consistent in his objections to the projected terms of the union of the crowns of England and Scotland, and supported his measure of limitations in animated speeches. After the Union he retired from public life; but in 1710 he did his country a real if homely service by introducing from Holland the art of making pot barley, and also the use of fanners for sifting grain. He died in London in 1716. A contemporary describes him as a “low, thin man, of a brown complexion; full of fire; with a stern, sour look.” Among the small band of good early Scotch prose authors he holds a prominent place, and in the domain of politics he is the most readable and entertaining of them all. His style has the singular freshness of foreign culture, and, charged with strong feeling, his sentences frequently turn into forcible epigrams. But both his writings and his speeches possess a value beyond that of literary excellence; they afford us bright glimpses of the manners and state of the country of his time. In literature his name is best known in connexion with an often quoted remark, which occurs in An Account of a Conversation concerning a right Regulation of Governments for the Common Good of Mankind :— “I said I knew a very wise man so much of Sir Christopher’s [Musgrave] sentiment, that he believed if a man were permitted to make all the ballads he need not care who should make the laws of a nation. And we find that most of the ancient legislators thought they could not well reform the manners of any city without the help of a lyric, and sometimes of a dramatic poet.”

See The Political Works of Andrew Fletcher, Esq., Glasgow, 1749, to which estimates of his character by Rawlinson and Lockhart are prefixed; Essay on his Life and Writings, by the Earl of Buchan, 1792; Historical Account of the Ancient Rights and Power of the Parliament of Scotland, 1823, a laboured, interesting treatise, first published anonymously and now attributed to Fletcher.
