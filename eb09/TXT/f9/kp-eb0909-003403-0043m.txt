FARINELLI (1705-1782), whose real name was Carlo Broschi, one of the most extraordinary singers that ever lived, was born January 24, 1705, at Naples (Burney), or, according to Sacchi, his biographer, at Andria. Having been prepared for the career of a sopranist, he soon acquired a voice the beauty of which has never been surpassed, under the instruction of the celebrated Porpora. He became famous, while yet a boy, throughout southern Italy, where he was usually called il ragazzo; and in 1722 he made his debut in “Eomene,” written by his master, at Rome, where he created the greatest astonishment by vying with a celebrated German trumpet-player in holding and swelling a note of prodigious length and power. In 1724 he appeared at Vienna, and at Venice in the following year, and returned to Naples shortly afterwards. He sang at Milan in 1726, and in 1727 at Bologna, where he met for the first time the great artist, Bernacchi, to whose instruction he was indebted for some of his subsequent improvement. After revisiting Vienna, Farinelli, with ever-increasing success and fame, appeared in nearly all the great cities of Italy; and he returned a third time to Vienna in 1731. Here he received from Charles VI. a piece of sound criticism and kindly advice, which led him to acquire a pathos in his singing which he had not till then possessed, having hitherto always adhered to the florid, bravura style, peculiar to the school of Porpora. After making another tour of the Italian cities he came to London in 1734, arriving here in time to lend his powerful support to the faction which had just set up an opposition to Handel; but not even his aid could make the undertaking successful, though he was assisted by Porpora and the celebrated Senesino. Having spent three years in England, Farinelli, loaded with presents, set out for Spain, staying a few months by the way in France, where he sang before Louis XV., and was rewarded with a handsome snuff-box containing the king’s portrait set in diamonds, and 500 louis d’or. In Spain, where he had only meant to stay a few months, he ended by passing nearly twenty-five years. His voice, used by the queen to cure Philip V. of his melancholy madness, acquired for him, through the success of the treatment, an influence with that prince which gave him eventually the power, if not the name, of prime minister. This power he was wise and modest enough to use discreetly; and he always conciliated the enemies whom his favour raised up against him. He had, however, to pay for his position a price which to every artist must seem too heavy,—that of singing night after night to the king the same six songs, and never anything else. Under Ferdinand VI. he held the same place, and was decorated with the cross of Calatrava. He utilized his ascendency over this king by persuading him to establish an Italian opera. While at Madrid he heard of the death of Bernacchi, of whom he speaks in terms of affection and esteem in an extant letter addressed to the Padre Martini. Returning to Bologna, Farinelli spent the remainder of his days there in a melancholy splendour, and died July 15,1782, aged 77. His voice was of large compass, possessing seven or eight notes more than those of ordinary singers, and was sonorous, equal, and clear; and he also possessed a great knowledge of music.
