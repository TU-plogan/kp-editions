FERDINAND VI. (1713-1759), king of Spain, sometimes called the Sage, the younger son of Philip V. and Maria Louisa of Savoy, was born at Madrid, September 23, 1713. On the death of his elder brother Louis in 172 5, Ferdinand was proclaimed prince of the Asturias; and in 1729 he was betrothed to Barbara, daughter of J ohn V. of Portugal. He succeeded his father on July 9,1746. Since 1739 Spain had been involved in protracted war, first with England in consequence of disputes relative to British interests in the West Indies, and afterwards, since 1740, with Austria on the accession of Maria Theresa. It was Ferdinand’s first endeavour on coming to the throne to secure peace for his exhausted country, and one of the earliest acts of his government was to order the withdrawal of the Spanish troops from Italy (August 1746). Soon afterwards negotiations were opened for peace with England; and these, though frequently interrupted, ultimately resulted in the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which terminated the war of the Austrian succession, thus restoring peace to Europe (October 1748). Weak in health and despondent in temperament, Ferdinand had no inclination thenceforward to take an active part in European affairs, and the management of the public business he abandoned almost entirely to his ministers Ensenada, [9:9:83] Carvajal, and Wall. These, however, always found it necessary to take into their counsels the queen, to whom Ferdinand was much attached, the royal confessor Rabago, and the singer Farinelli, whose musical powers had given him extraordinary influence. During this reign the condition of Spanish finance was much improved; agriculture, commerce, and the arts were encouraged; by a concordat with Pope Benedict XIV., in 1753, many abuses of ecclesiastical patronage were reformed; nor were the affairs of the army and navy neglected. On the outbreak of the Seven Years’ War in 1756, Spain steadfastly maintained a strict neutrality, notwithstanding the repeated efforts both of France and of England to secure her intervention, the former offering Minorca and the latter Gibraltar as the price of her assistance. On the death of his consort in 1758, Ferdinand fell into a profound melancholy, which issued in a confirmed insanity, under which he died at Villaviciosa on the 10th of August 1759. Leaving no issue, he was succeeded, in terms of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, by his half-brother Charles IIL Though he was in no sense an able sovereign, and was remarkable for nothing unless for a pacific and kindly disposition, his reign was an exceptionally prosperous one for Spain, and critics generally concur in the observation of Coxe that, “since the elevation of the house of Bourbon to the throne of Spain, no period occurs in which the interests and independence of the kingdom were so well and so consistently supported as during the reign of Ferdinand VL”
