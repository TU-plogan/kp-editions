FRANCIA, a celebrated Bolognese painter was born towards 1450, and died 6th January 1517. His real name was Francesco Raibolini, his father being Marco di Giacomo Raibolini, a carpenter; he was apprenticed to a goldsmith named Francia, and from him probably he got the nickname whereby he is generally known; he, moreover, studied design under Marco Zoppo. The youth was thus originally a goldsmith, and also an engraver of dies and niellos, and in these arts he became extremely eminent. He was particularly famed for his dies for medals; he rose to be mint-master at Bologna, and retained that office till the end of his life. A famous medal of Pope Julius II. as liberator of Bologna is ascribed to his hand, but not with certainty. At a mature age—having first, it appears, become acquainted with Mantegna—he turned his attention to painting. His earliest known picture is dated 1494 (not 1490, as ordinarily stated). It shows so much mastery that one is compelled to believe that Raibolini must .before then have practised painCing for some few years. This work is now in the Bologna gallery,—the Virgin enthroned, with Augustine and five other saints. It is an oil picture, and was originally painted for the church of S. Maria della Misericordia, at the desire of the Bentivoglio family, the rulers of Bologna. The same patrons employed him upon frescos in their own palace; one of Judith and Holophernes is especially noted, its style recalling that of Mantegna. Francia probably studied likewise the works of Perugino; and he became a friend and ardent admirer of Raphael, to whom he addressed an enthusiastic sonnet. Raphael cordially responded to the Bolognese master’s admiration, and said, in a letter dated in 1508, that few painters or none had produced Madonnas more beautiful, more devout, or better portrayed than those of Francia. If we may trust Vasari—but it is difficult to suppose that he was entirely correct—the exceeding value which Francia set on Raphael’s art brought him to his grave. Raphael had consigned to Francia his famous picture of St Cecilia, destined for the church of S. Giovanni in Monte, Bologna; and Francia, on inspecting it, took so much to heart his own inferiority, at the advanced age of about sixty-six, to the youthful Umbrian, that he sickened and shortly expired. Distanced though he may have been by Raphael, Francia is rightly regarded as the greatest painter of the earlier Bolognese school, and hardly to be surpassed as representing the art termed “antico-moderno,” or of the “quattrocento.” It has been well observed that his style is a medium between that of Porugino and that of Giovanni Bellini; he has somewhat more of spontaneous naturalism than the former, and of abstract dignity in feature and form than the latter. The magnificent portrait in the Louvre of a young man in black, of brooding thoughtfulness and saddened profundity of mood, would alone suffice to place Francia among the very great masters, if it could with confidence be attributed to his hand, but in all probability its real author was Franciabigio; it had erewhile passed under the name of Raphael, of Giorgione, or of Sebastian del Piombo. The London National Gallery contains two remarkably fine specimens of Francia, once combined together as principal picture and lunette,—the Virgin and Child and St Anne enthroned, surrounded by saints, and (in the lunette) the Pietà, or lamentation of angels over the dead Saviour. They come from the Buonvisi chapel in the church of S. Frediano, Lucca. Other leading works are—in Munich, the Virgin sinking on her knees in adoration of the Divine Infant, who is lying in a garden within a rose trellis; in the Borghese Gallery, Rome, a Peter Martyr; in Bologna, the frescos in the church of St Cecilia, illustrating the life of the saint, all of them from the design of Raibolini, but not all executed by himself; a public passage now traverses these frescos, and they are in a pitiful state of decay. His landscape backgrounds are of uncommon excellence. Francia had more than 200 scholars. Marcantonio Raimondi the famous engraver is now the most renowned of them; next to him, the painter Lorenzo Costa; also Amico Aspertini, and Francia’s own son Giacomo, and his cousin Julio.
