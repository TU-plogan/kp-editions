FLOURENS, Gustave (1838-1871), a French social democrat and writer, a son of Μ. J. P. Flourens, was bom at Paris, August 4, 1838. Before he had attained his twenty-first year he obtained at the college of Louis-leGrand the diplomas of licentiate in letters and in sciences. In 1863 he undertook for his father a course of lectures at the Collège de France, the subject of which was the history of mankind. His theories as to the manifold origin of the human race, however, gave offence to the clergy, and he was precluded from delivering a second course. He then repaired to Brussels, where he published his lectures under the title of Histoire de Γ Homme; he next visited Constantinople and Athens, took part in the Cretan insurrection of 1866, spent some time in Italy, where an article of his in the Popolo dLtalia caused his arrest and imprisonment, and finally, having returned to France, nearly lost his life in a duel with Paul de Cassagnac, editor of the Pays. In Paris he devoted his pen to the cause of republicanism, and at length, having failed in an attempt to organize a revolution at Belleville, February 7, 1870, found himself compelled to flee from France. Returning to Paris on the downfall of Napoleon, he soon placed himself at the head of a body of 500 tirailleurs. On account of his insurrectionary proceedings he was taken prisoner at Créteil, near Vincennes, by the provisional government, and confined at Mazas, December 7, 1870, but was released by his men on the night of January 21-22. On the !8th March he joined the Communists. As colonel of the 19th and 20th arrondissements he took part in an attack on Versailles, and early in the morning of the 3d of April was killed in a hand-to-hand conflict at Rueil, near Malmaison. Besides his Science de I’ Homme (Paris, 1869), Gustave Flourens was the author of numerous fugitive pamphlets.
