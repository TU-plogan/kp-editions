FÁY, Andrâs (1786-1864), Hungarian poet and author, born 30th May 1786, at KohAny in the county of Zernplin, was educated for the legal profession at the Protestant college of Sârospatak. Being, however, subsequently obliged to abandon the law as a vocation, on account of ill-health, he devoted himself to literary pursuits, and became one of the best writers of Hungarian narrative prose. His Mesek {Fables), the first edition of which appeared at Vienna in 1820, evinced his powers of satire and invention, and won him the well-merited applause of his countrymen. These fables, which, on account of their originality and simplicity, have caused FAy to be regarded as the Hungarian Aesop, were translated into German by Petz, Raab, 1825, and partly into English by E. D. Butler, Hungarian Poems and Fables, London, 1877. Fay wrote also numerous poems, the chief of which are to be found in the collections Βokreta {Nosegay), Pesth, 1807, and Fris Bokreta {Fresh Nosegay), Pesth, 1818. He also composed several plays and romances and numerous tales, busying himself through the whole of his career with every kind of literary work. In the year 1835 FAy was elected representative for the county of Pesth, in the Hungarian diet, where he became for a time the leader of the opposition party; and, though afterwards eclipsed by Kossuth, he still continued to distinguish himself both by his liberal sentiments and by his unremitting efforts for the material internal progress of the nation. It is to him that the Pesth Savings Bank owes its origin, and he was one of the chief founders of the Hungarian National Theatre. He died on the 26th July 1864. His earlier works were published in a collective form at Pesth, 1843-44, 8 vols. The most noteworthy of his later works is a humorous novel entitled Jdvor orvos és Bakator Ambrvs szolgdia {Javor the Doctor and his servant Ambrose Bakator), Pesth, 1855, 2 vols.
