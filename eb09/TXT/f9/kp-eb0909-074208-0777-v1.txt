FREDERICTON, a city and port of entry of New Brunswick, Canada, capital of the province, is situated on the St John river, 88 miles from its mouth. It stands on a plain bounded on one side by the river, which is here three-fourths of a mile broad, and on the other by a range of hills which almost encircle the town. It is regularly built with long and straight streets, and contains some handsome public buildings, among which are the province hall, the government house, the county court-house, the cathedral church, the university, and several other educational establishments. Fredericton is the principal commercial entrepôt with the interior of the province, and has also a large trade in lumber. The river is navigable for large steamers up to the city, and above it transport is effected in vessels of lighter draughts. A steam-ferry across the river connects the city with the town of St Mary. Fredericton was incorporated in 1849. Population in 1852, 4458, and in 1871, 6006.
