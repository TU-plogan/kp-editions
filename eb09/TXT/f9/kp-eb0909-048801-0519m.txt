FOUQUIER-TINVILLE, Antoine Quentin (1747- 1795), was born at Hérouel, a village in the department of the Aisne. Originally a procureur (attorney) attached to the châtelet jurisdiction at Paris, he is said to have been driven by his debts to accept a humble employment under the lieutenant-général de police. When the Revolution broke out he was, as the friend of Danton and Robespierre, appointed public prosecutor to the revolutionary tribunal of Paris, and discharged this office with the most un impassioned rigour from the 10th of March 1793 to the 28th of July 1794. He dealt as pitilessly with his friends as with his enemies, if only they were charged by the committee of public safety. He sent to the guillotine his protector Danton, just as he had sent Vergniaud and the Girondists. He was not an eloquent speaker, but maintained his accusations with an obstinacy so. cold, convincing, and pressing that he never failed to obtain from the judges the sentence of capital punishment, which he always claimed. Although it seems that he had been somewhat unscrupulous in the earlier part of his career, he was, during the period of his bloody mission, inaccessible to bribery; and, having accepted it as his business to provide the guillotine with a constant supply of victims, he might well boast of faithfulness in its discharge. And this he actually did in the pamphlet that he published in his own defence, when he had been imprisoned by order of the convention (August 1, 1794), on the motion of Fréron, whose hands had been as deeply imbrued in blood as those of Fouquier. But the men then in power wielded the terrors of the law in a spirit of revenge that made them as unsparing as Robespierre and his companions had been. After a trial which lasted forty-one days, Fouquier-Tinville was in his turn sent to the scaffold, on the 8th of May 1795.
