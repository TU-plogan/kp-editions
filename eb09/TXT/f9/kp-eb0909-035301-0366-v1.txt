FOGARAS, the capital of an Hungarian county of the same name, in Transylvania, is situated on the left bank of the river AIuta, 55 miles east of Hermannstadt, 45° 47' N. lat., 24° 54' E. long. Among the principal buildings are a Franciscan monastery, five churches, and a county court-house. The population in 1870 amounted to 4714. It was near this town that Bern was defeated by the Russian generals Engelhardt and Lüders on the 12th July, 1849. The county of Fogaras lies on the Wallachian frontier, between the county of Brassó or Cronstadt on the east, and that of Nagy Szeben or Hermannstadt on the west. The climate being cold, and the surface of the country for the most part mountainous and unfavourable to agriculture, the inhabitants arc chiefly employed in rearing cattle. The population of the old district in 1870 amounted to 82,852, of whom the greater number were Wallachians, the remainder being Saxons and Hungarians. The transformation of the district of Fogaras into a county took place in 1876.
