FORTUNA, the Latin goddess of Fortune, answering to the Greek Tyche, τvχη. This deity was of far more importance in Italy than among the Greeks, the special characteristic of the Italian or Latin religion being the worship of abstract qualities. At Rome the culture of Fortune was said to have been introduced and established by Ancus Marcius and Servius Tullius; and her temples were especially honoured at Antium and Praeneste, where her oracular responses were in the highest repute. She was worshipped under a vast variety of epithets, the most prominent being virilis, as denoting the power which secured to women the affections of their husbands; muliebris, a name connected with the legend which made the women of Rome prevail over the resolution of Coriolanus; publico, privata, conservatrix, primigenia, &c. We hear also of a Fortuna Mammosa, corresponding to the many-breasted Artemis of Ephesus, and to the Teutonic Ciza, Zizi, whose name Tacitus in his Germania, c. 9, seems to have confounded with that of the Egyptian Isis.
