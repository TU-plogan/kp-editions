FLOR, Roger di, a military adventurer who, in the early years of the 14th century, distinguished himself as. leader of the Catalan Grand Company. He was the second son of a falconer in the service of the emperor Frederick IL, and when eight years old was sent to sea in a galley belonging to the Knights Templars. He entered the order, and became commander of a galley. At the siege of Acre by the Saracens in 1291 he absented himself, took no part in the defence of the town, and was accused of appropriating to his own use the treasures of his order. He was denounced to the pope by the grand master as a thief and an apostate, was degraded from his rank, and threatened with arrest. To escape imprisonment he fled to Genoa, where he began to play the pirate. The struggle between the kings of Aragon and the French kings of Naples for the possession of Sicily was at this time going on: and Roger entered the service of Frederick, king of Sicily, who gave him the rank of vice-admiral. At the close of the war, in 1302, Frederick being anxious to free the island from the auxiliaries whom he had no longer the means of paying, Roger induced his followers to seek new adventures in the East, in fighting against the Turks, who were ravaging the empire. The emperor Andronicus II. accepted his offer of service; and in September 1303 Roger with his fleet and army arrived at Constantinople. He was adopted into the imperial family, was married to a granddaughter of the emperor, and was made grand duke and commander-in-chief of the army and the fleet. After some weeks lost in dissipation, intrigues, and bloody quarrels, Roger and his men were sent into Asia, and after some successful encounters with the Turks they went into winter quarters at Cyzicus. In May 1304 they again took the field, and rendered the important service of relieving Philadelphia, then invested and reduced to extremities by the Turks. But Roger, bent on advancing his own interests rather than those of the emperor, determined to found in the East a principality for himself. He sent his treasures to Magnesia, but the people slew his Catalans and seized the treasures. He then formed the siege of the town but his attacks were repulsed, and he was compelled to raise the siege. Passing over into Europe, he settled his troops in Gallipoli and other towns, and visited Constantinople to demand pay for the Grand Company. Dissatisfied with the small sum granted by the emperor, he plundered the country and carried on intrigues both with and against the emperor. In the spring of 1306 Roger was created Caesar, this being the first time that the title was given to a mere adventurer. Before setting out on a second expedition to Philadelphia, he visited the young emperor Michael at Adrianople; and there he was assassinated and his Catalan cavalry were massacred, April 4, 1306. His death was avenged by a war which was fiercely waged by the Grand Company against the Greeks.
