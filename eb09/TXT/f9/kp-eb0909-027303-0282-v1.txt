FIVES is a game which has existed in various forms from the earliest times. The name is derived from the essential feature of the pastime consisting in striking a ball with the five digits of the human hand, the idea of there sometimes having been five players on each side requiring confirmation. Amongst the Greeks the ατr0ρρα^ις was somewhat akin, since a ball was struck with the hand as many successive times as possible at each rebound from the ground. Of the method of playing the Roman pila we possess no details. Horace ∖ foat., i. 5, 48) speaks of it thus :—

Lusum it Maecenas, dormitum ego Virgiliusque; Namque pila lippis inimicum et ludere crudis.

Judging from these lines the ball play of that day must have been both fatiguing and dangerous. In the Close Roll, 39 Edward III. (1365) mem. 23, pila manualis is mentioned as one of those pastimes which had caused the recent deterioration of archery, and some description of fives is no doubt referred to. During the 15th century palm play in England and jeτι de paume in France were the chief analogous pastimes. In recent times our great public schools and universities have become the sole nurseries of fives. In the “open” court the only desiderata are a level piece of ground with a smooth wall in front against which the ball is struck. A “close” court has in addition two side-walls at right angles to the front one, and the whole may or may not be covered in. The invariable principle is to strike the ball, not later than at its first rebound from the ground, against the front wall and above a certain line as many consecutive times as possible. A single game comprises one player a side, a double one two. The minor rules vary at most schools and universities, and are generally handed down by tradition. About two inches is the usual diameter of the ball, the core being made of india-rubber, bound round with fine twine, and covered with white leather.
