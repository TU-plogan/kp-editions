FUSEL OIL, the name applied to the volatile oily liquids, of a nauseous fiery taste and smell, which are obtained in the rectification of spirituous liquors made by the fermentation of grain, potatoes, the marc of grapes, and other material, aud which, as they are of higher boiling-point than ethylic alcohol, occur in largest quantity in the last portions of the distillate. Besides ethylic or ordinary alcohol, and amylic or pentylic alcohol, which are present in them all, there have been found in fusel oils several other bodies of the C n H 2n+1 .OH series, also certain ethers, and members of the C s H 2n O 2 series of fatty acids. Normal propylic alcohol, C s H 7 .OH, is contained in the fusel oil of the marc brandy of the south of France, and isoprimary butylic alcohol, CH (CH 3 ) 2 .CHjj.OH, in that of beet-root molasses. The chief constituent of the fusel oil procured in the manufacture of alcohol from potatoes and grain, usually known as fusel oil and potato-spirit, is isoprimary amylic alcohol, or isobutylcarbinol, CH(CH 3 ) 2 .CH 2 .CH 2 .OH, boiling at 129°-130° C., and inactive as regards polarized light. Ordinary fusel oil yields besides another isomeric amylic alcohol, boiling at about 128°, and laevorotatory. The formation of amylic alcohol is stated by Liebig {Familiar Letters on Chemistry, p. 217, 4th ed., 1859) never to take place in fermenting fluids in the presence of tartar, of racemic, tartaric, or citric acid, or of certain bitter substances, as hops. It is produced principally in alkaline or neutral liquids, and in such as contain lactic or acetic acid. Schorlemmer {Proc. Roy. Soc., xv., 1866, p. 131) has shown that amyl-compounds prepared from fusel oil and from American petroleum agree in specific gravity and boiling point, and are therefore to be regarded as identical. Variable quantities of fusel oil, less or greater according to the stage of ripening, exist in commercial spirits. Administered in small amount, it exercises a poisonous action, causing thirst and headache, with furred tongue {Brit, and For. Med.-Chir. Rev., xxviii., 1861, p. 101). In crude spirit made from potatoes, after its purification in the cold from noxious gases by means of charcoal, Μ. Rabuteau found 50 per cent, of ethylic, and 1 - 5 per cent of isopropylic alcohol, and traces of propylic, and of ordinary and a more complex amylic alcohol. He discovered that in - 5 ⅛ aqueous solution ethylic alcohol was not injurious to frogs, isopropylic alcohol killed after some hours, and propylic alcohol in a single hour, whilst the vapours of a similar solution of amylic alcohol were instantaneously fatal to them, and even diluted to as much as 500 times its bulk that body exercised on them a poisonous influence. The widely different actions of common alcohol and of such compounds as the potato-oils in intoxicating drinks, he points out, render it necessary to distinguish between the excitable ethylism produced by the former, and the dull and heavy amylism, or more properly polyalcoholism of the latter. (See Le Progrès Médical, 1878, p. 979, “Société de Biologie.”) To remove fusel oil from spirits, a matter of prime importance to the distiller, a great number of methods have been resorted to. A practically pure spirit can be obtained by rectification several times after dilution with water, or by the use of specially constructed stills, as Coffey’s (see Distillation, vol. vii. pp. 265-6). Among the materials which have been employed for the complete defuselation of spirit are the powder of freshly burnt charcoal, which acts best when the vapour of the liquid is passed through it, and charcoal with manganese peroxide, with slaked lime, and with soap-boilers’ lye; also saturated solution of chloride of lime, alone or with zinc chloride; and calcium chloride, olive oil, soda-soap, and milk. The presence of fusel oil in spirit may be suspected when the addition of four parts of water causes milkiness. It is detected by its odour when the spirit is diluted with warm water, or when its ethylic alcohol has been allowed to evaporate. To remove the last-named body and water from fusel oil calcium chloride has been employed. The estimation of the alcohols of fusel oil may be effected by Dupré’s process, in which their corresponding acids are obtained by oxidizing with sulphuric acid and potassium dichromate, and eventually the quantity of barium in the barium salts of the purified acids is determined (see Analyst, Mar. 31, 1871). Fusel oil is employed in the arts as a source of amylic alcohol.
