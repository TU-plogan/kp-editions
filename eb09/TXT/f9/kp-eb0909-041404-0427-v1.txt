FORLÌ, Melozzo da (c. 1438-1494), an eminent painter, particularly renowned as the first who practised foreshortening with much success. He was born, as his ordinary designation indicates, at Forlì about the year 1438; he came of a wealthy family named Ambrosi. In all probability, Melozzo studied painting under Piero della Francesca, of Borgo S. Sepolcro; he seems also to have been well acquainted with Giovanni Santi, the father of Raphael. It has been said that he became a journeyman [9:9:415] and colour-grinder to some of the best masters, in order to prosecute his studies; this lacks confirmation. Only three works are now extant which, can safely be assigned to Melozzo. (1) He painted in 1472 the vault of the chief chapel' in the church of the Apostoli in Rome, his subject being the Ascension of Christ; the figure of Christ is so boldly and effectively foreshortened that it seemed to “burst through the vaulting”; this fresco was taken down in 1711, and the figure of Christ is now in the Quirinal Palace, not worthy of special admiration save in its perspective quality; while some of the other portions, almost Raphaelesque in merit, are in the sacristy of St Peter’s. (2) Between 1475 and 1480 he executed a fresco, now transferred to canvas, and placed in the Vatican picture-gallery, representing the appointment of Platina by Pope Sixtus IV. as librarian of the restored Vatican library,—an excellent work of dignified portraiture. (3) In the Collegio at Forli is a fresco by Melozzo, termed the “Pestapepe,” or Pepper-grinder, originally painted as a grocer’s sign; it is an energetic specimen of rather coarse realism, now so damaged that one can hardly assess its merits. Melozzo also painted the cupola of the Capuchin church at Forlì, destroyed in 1651; and it has been said that he executed at Urbino some of the portraits of great men (Plato, Dante, Sixtus IV., <fcc.) which are now divided between the Barberini Palace and the Campana collection in Paris; this, however, appears to be more than doubtful, and it is even questionable whether Melozzo was ever at Urbino. In Rome he was one of the original members of the academy of St Luke, founded by Sixtus IV. He returned to Forlì, probably towards 1480, and died in November 1494. He contributed sensibly to the progress of pictorial art; and, without being remarkable as a colourist, gave well graded lights, with general care and finish, and fine dignified figures. His works bear a certain degree of resemblance to those of his contemporary Mantegna. Marco Palmezzano was his pupil; and the signature “Marcus de Melotius” on some of Palmezzano’s works has, along with the general affinity of style, led to their being ascribed to Melozzo, who has himself been hence incorrectly called “Marco Melozzo.”
