FUSTIAN, a term which includes a variety of heavy woven cotton fabrics, chiefly prepared for men’s wear. It embraces plain twilled cloth called jean, and cut fabrics similar to velvet, known as velveteen, moleskin, corduroy, &c. The operations connected with the finishing of cut fustian (cutting, brushing, and singeing, &c.) are conducted under unhealthy conditions. The name is said to be derived from El-Fustat, a suburb of Cairo (see vol. vii. p. 769), where it was first made; and certainly a kind of cloth has been long known under that name. In a petition to parliament, temp. Philip and Mary, “fustian of Naples” is mentioned, and in books of a later time this term was abridged to fustiananapes, whence arose an obvious corruption fustian and apes.
