FRÉRON, Louis Stanislas (1765-1802), a French Revolutionist, son of the preceding, was born at Paris in 1765. His name was, on the death of his father, attached to L'Année Littéraire, which was continued till 1790, and edited successively by the Abbés Royou and Geoffroy. On the outbreak of the Revolution, Fréron, who was a schoolfellow of Robespierre and Camille Desmoulins, established the violent journal L'Orateur du Peuple. Commissioned along with Barras in 1793 to establish the authority of the Convention at Marseilles and Toulon, he distinguished himself equally with his colleague in the atrocity of his reprisals, but both afterwards joined the Thermidoriens, and Fréron became the leader of the Jeunesse Dorée. He then made his paper the official journal of the reactionists, and being sent by the Directory on a mission of peace to Marseilles he published in 1796 Mémoire historique sur la réaction royale et sur les malheurs du midi. He died in 1802 at St Domingo, where he was for a few months subprefect.
