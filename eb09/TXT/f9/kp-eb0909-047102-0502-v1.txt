FOSCARINI, Michele (1632-1692), Venetian historian, was born in 1632. By the deaths of his father and mother he became head of his house at the age of nineteen. Of patrician rank, he entered upon official life in 1657, and after filling various posts became in 1662 one of the aι∙oga> dori of the republic. Two years later he was appointed governor of Corfu with the title of proυveditore and captain. Returning to Venice in 1668, he was selected to fill some of the most honourable offices of the republic. On the death of Battista Nani in 1678, Foscarini was called to succeed him as historiographer of Venice. He continued the history begun by Bembo, and carried on by other writers, from 1669 to 1690, but had not quite completed his work when he died suddenly, March 31, 1692. The Istoria della Republica Veneta was published by his brother Sebastian! in 1696, and has been several times reprinted. Foscarini was author also of two Novelle written in his youth; and he annotated Caramella’s Museum illustriorum Poetarum (1653).
