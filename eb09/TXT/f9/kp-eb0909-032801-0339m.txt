FLODOARD, or Frodoart (894-966), a French chronicler, was born at Epernay in 894. He was educated at Rheims, and for some time held the office of canon in the cathedral of that city. The later years of his life were spent in retirement at a neighbouring monastery, and were devoted to study and the exercises of piety. He died 28th March 966. His works are the most important contribution to the French literature of his time, and consist of Histoire de l’église de Rheims ; Chronique sacrée, a poetical history of Jesus Christ, the apostles, the popes, and the saints and martyrs of the church; and Chronicam Rerum inter Francos gestarum, which, beginning with the year 919 and ending with 966, throws more light than any other document on the annals of the 10 th century. This work was first printed in the Rerum Burgundicarum Chronicon, Basel, 1575; and a translation of it was inserted by Guizot in his Collection des Mémoires relatifs à l’ Histoire de France. The prose of Flodoard is very correct and elegant, but his poetry is no exception to the mechanical, unmusical, and common-place verses belonging to this period of literature.
