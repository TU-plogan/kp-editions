FRUGONI, Carlo Innocenzo (1692-1768), an Italian poet, was born at Genoa 21st November 1692. In accordance with the custom of the family to which he belonged, being destined, as the youngest son, for the ecclesiastical profession, he was, at the age of fifteen, in opposition to his strong wishes, shut up in a convent; and although in the following year he was induced to pronounce monastic vows, his sentiments continued to remain completely at variance with the profession he had adopted. He, however, made so rapid progress in his studies that he soon acquired considerable reputation as an elegant writer both of Latin and Italian prose and verse; and from 1716 to 1724 he filled the chairs of rhetoric at Brescia, Rome, Genoa, Bologna, and Modena successively, attracting by his brilliant fluency a large number of students at each university. Through Cardinal Bentivoglio he was recommended to Antonio Farnese, duke of Parma, who appointed him his poet laureate; and he remained at the court of Parma until the death of Antonio, after which he returned to Genoa. Shortly afterwards, through the intercession of Bentivoglio, he obtained from the pope the remission of his monastic vows, and by eloquent representations he ultimately succeeded in recovering a portion of his paternal inheritance. After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, he returned to the court of Parma, aud there devoted the later years of his life chiefly to poetical composition. He died 20th December 1768. Frugoni holds a place in the first rank of the lyrical poets of his time, and his other compositions, which embrace almost every form of poetry, have in most cases considerable merit, and are generally characterized by harmony of versification, elegance of language, and appositeness and great variety of imagery.

His collected works were published at Parma in 10 vols, in 1799, and a more complete edition appeared at Lucca in the same year in 15 vols. A selection from his works was published at. Brescia in 1782, in 4 vols.
