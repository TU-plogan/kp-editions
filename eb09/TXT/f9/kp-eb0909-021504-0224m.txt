FINISTÈRE, or Finisterre, the most western department of France, forming part of the old province of Bretagne or Brittany, is bounded on the N.W. and S. by the ocean, and on the E. by the departments of Côtes-du-Nord and Morbihan. It extends from 47° 44'to 48° 47' N. lat., and from 3’ 22' to 4° 50' W. long., being 78 miles in length from north to south by 63 in width, and having an area of 666,705 hectares, or 2574 square miles. Two [9:9:216] chains of hills run nearly parallel from east to west through this department, and divide it into three zones of almost equal extent, conveying the waters in three different directions. North of the Arrez, or more northern of the two chains, the waters of the Douron, Jarleuc, Penzé, and Flèche flow northward to the sea. South of the Noires range, the Odet, Aven, Ioste, and Elie flow southward; while the region inclosed by the two chains having a declination westward, the waters of the Aulne and the Elorn flow into the Brest roads. The rivers are all small, and none of the hills attain a height of 900 feet. The coasts are generally steep and rocky, and indented with numerous bays and inlets, affording some excellent harbours, the principal being those of Brest, La Forest, Morlaix, Landernau, Quimper, and Douarnenez. The only navigable rivers are the Aulne, Elorn, and Odet. Off the coast lie a number of islands and rocky islets, the principal of which are Ushant and Bas. The climate is temperate, but rather humid; the prevailing winds are the W., S.W., aud N.W. More than a third of the soil is under cultivation, and about an equal proportion is heath or waste land, rather the larger proportion of the remainder being pasturage, and the rest woods and forests. Though so small a portion of the land is under cultivation, the produce of corn is more than sufficient for the population, and might be greatly increased if the primitive agricultural implements and methods still in use were superseded by the introduction of modern improvements. The chief crops are oats, rye, wheat, and barley; flax, hemp, and pulse are also produced. The farm and dairy produce, though plentiful in quantity, is indifferent in quality; but great attention is paid to the breeding and feeding of cattle. In the department there are a large number of orchards and gardens, and vegetables are largely grown for exportation. The fisheries of the coast, particularly the pilchard fishery, employ a great many hands, and render this department an excellent nursery of seamen for the French navy. Finistère is rich in minerals: iron, coal, lead, bismuth, and zinc mines are worked; and there are quarries of granite, slate, marble, and porphyry. The lead mines of Poullaouen and Huelgoat, which yielded a considerable quantity of silver, have not been worked since 1869. The manufactures are linens, woollens, sailcloth, ropes, paper, leather, earthenware, soda, soap, candles, sugar, &c. Shipbuilding is carried on at Brest and other seaports. Finistère is divided into the arrondissements of Quimperlé, Brest, Châteaulin, Morlaix, and Quimper, the town of Quimper being the capital of the department, The population of Finistère in 1872 was 642,963, and in 1876 it was 666,106.
