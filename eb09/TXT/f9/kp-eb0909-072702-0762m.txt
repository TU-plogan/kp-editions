FRAUENFELD, a town of Switzerland, capital of the canton of Thurgau (or Thurgovia), is situated in a beautiful and fertile district on the Murg, 23 miles N.E. of Zurich. It is the artillery depot for east Switzerland, and possesses an old castle with a tower belonging to the 10th century, an old Capuchin monastery, a town-house, an armoury, and a canton school. The chief industries are spinning and the manufacture of cotton cloth, but many of the inhabitants are engaged in agriculture. After the extinction of the countship of Alt-Frauenfeld, the town came into the possession of the counts of Kyburg, and subsequently into that of Austria. In 1799 a battle was fought there between the French and Austrians. The population in 1870, including the adjoining villages of Kurzdorf and Langdorf, was 4261.
