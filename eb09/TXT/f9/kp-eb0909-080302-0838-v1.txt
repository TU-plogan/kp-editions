FRONTINUS, Sextus Julius, a Roman soldier, and the author of some interesting works, was born of a patrician family at Rome about 40 a.d. Nothing is known of his early life or history till we find him acting oãpraetor urbanus, under Vespasian, in 70, an office from which he soon retired to make way for Domitian. Five years later he was sent into Britain to succeed Petilius Cerealis as governor of that island. He subdued the Silures, and held the other native tribes in check till 78, when he was superseded by Agricola. In 97 he was appointed curator aquarum at Rome, an office which was never conferred except upon persons of very high standing. He was also a member of the college of augurs, retaining the dignity till his death, which appears to have happened about 103, The later years of his life were spent in studious retirement on the shores of Campania. Many works have been attributed to Frontinus, of which only two that are undoubtedly his are now extant. The first of these is a treatise on tactics entitled Straiegematicon Libri IV., and the second is entitled De Aquis Urbis Romae Libri II. The latter conveys in a clear and terse style much valuable information on the manner in which ancient Rome was supplied with water, and on other matters of importance in the history of architecture. A large number of interpolations have been inserted into the Strateg emat icon by various writers. The two works have been translated into most of the languages of Europe.

The best editions of the Strategematicon are those of Oudendorp, Leyden, 1731, and Schwebel, Leipsic, 1772. The best editions of the De Aquis are those of Polenus, Pavia, 1722, andG. C. Adler, Altona, 1792.
