FRASERBURGH, a seaport town of Scotland, Aberdeenshire, on the south side of Kinnaird’s Head, 42 miles north of Aberdeen. It is built nearly in the form of a square, and most of the streets cross each other at right angles. The cross is a fine structure of a hexagonal form, covering an area of 500 feet, and surmounted by a stone pillar 12 feet high, ornamented by the British arms and the arms of Fraser of Philorth. Fraserburgh is one of the chief stations of the herring fishing in Scotland, the number of herring boats engaged by the curers of the port averaging about 900. During the herring season the increase to the population of the town is upwards of 10,000. In 1877 the number of barrels of herrings cured in Fraserburgh was 180,000, and the value of the herring landed was about <£280,000. The harbour, originally constructed as a refuge for British ships of war, is one of the best on the east coast of Scotland, and has lately been improved by the widening of the piers, and the extension of the breakwaters. The total sum expended on the harbour from 1857 to 1877 was £87,485. It has an area of upwards of six acres, is easy of access, and affords anchorage for vessels of every size. Still further improvements are proceeding, which, when completed, will afford outside the harbour an area of 8 acres of sheltered water, with a depth of from one to two fathoms at low tide. The population of Fraserburgh in 1871 was 4268.

Fraserburgh takes its name from Sir Alex. Fraser of Philorth, who in 1613 obtained for it a charter as a burgh of regality, and whose representative, Lord Saltoun, is now superior of the town. The same Sir A. Fraser obtained in 1592 a charter for the institution and endowment of a college and university here; and at the west end of the town is a quadrangular tower of three stories, which formed part of the building designed for this seminary. The intention was subsequently abandoned, probably from want of funds.
