FÜRSTENBERG, the name of two noble houses of Germany.

I. The more important is in possession of a mediatized principality in the district of the Black Forest and the Upper Danube, which comprises the countship of Heilegen-berg, about 7 miles to the N. of the lake of Constance, the landgravates of Stühlingen and Baar, and the lordships of Jungnau, Trochtelfingen, Hausen, and Möskirch or Mess-kirch. The territory is discontinuous; and as it lies partly in Baden, partly in Würtemberg, and partly in the Prussian province of Sigmaringen, the head of the family is an hereditary member of the first chamber of Baden and of the chamber of peers in Würtemberg and in Prussia. The relations of the principality with Baden are defined by the treaty of May 1825, and its relations with Würtemberg by the royal declaration of 1839. The Stammort or ancestral seat of the family is Fürstenberg in the Black Forest, about 13 miles N. of Schaffhausen, but the principal residence of the present representatives of the main line is at Donaueschingen. The Fürstenbergs are descended from the counts of Urach, in the valley of the Ems, to the east of Tübingen,—Henry I., the youngest son of Egon VI. of Urach, ranking as the founder of the family. He was born about 1215, signalized himself as a supporter of the house of Hapsburg (which in the person of Rudolf, a relative of his own, ascended the throne in 1273), and died in 1284. On the death of Frederick III. in 1559, the family broke up into two lines, the Heiligenberg and the Kinzigerthal. To the former, which became extinct in 1716, belonged the well-known William Egon of Fürstenberg, who, in spite of his elevation to the rank of elector by the emperor Leopold, played into the hands of the French, had to leave Germany, and as a reward for his services was made archbishop of Strasburg in 1682. The latter furnished a large number of military and diplomatic servants to the German states. The various possessions of the family were united in 1744 under Joseph William Ernest, who was born in 1699 and died in 1762; and to him his descendants were indebted for the right that they all possess of taking the title of prince. On the failure of the male issue of his elder son in 1804, the inheritance passed to the representative of a younger Bohemian branch, Charles Egon, a prince memorable for the liberal spirit by which he was actuated, and for the number of his benevolent and scientific foundations, such as the infirmary at Donaueschingen and the blind asylum at Neidingen. The family is at present (1879) represented by his son Charles Egon. There are two subordinate branches, the Pürglitz with its chief residence at Lana in Bohemia, and the Königshof with its chief residence at Königshof in Bohemia.

II. The second Fürstenberg family has its possessions in Westphalia and the country of the Rhine, and takes its name from the castle of Fürstenberg on the Ruhr, which is said to have been built by count Dietrich or Theodoric of Oldenburg, in the 11th century. The two most remarkable men whom it has produced are Francis Frederick William and Francis Egon. The former (1729-1811) became ultimately minister of the prince-bishop of Münster, and effected a great number of important reforms in the administration of the country; the latter (1797-1859) was an enthusiastic patron of art, zealously advocating the completion of the Cologne cathedral, and erecting the beautiful church of Apollinaris, near Remagen on the Rhine.
