FERDINAND II. (1578-1637), emperor, was the grandson of the preceding and the son of Charles duke of Styria and of Mary of Bavaria, and was born at Gratz, 9th July 1578. He was educated by the Jesuits, and having imbibed strong anti-Protestant sentiments is said to have taken a solemn vow before the altar that, on receiving the imperial crown, promised him by his cousin Matthias IL, he would at whatever cost re-establish the Roman Catholic religion throughout all his states. In 1618 Matthias abdicated the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary in his favour, and on the death of Matthias in 1619 he laid claim to the imperial crown. His keen Roman Catholic sympathies, allied to a character gloomy, fanatical, and cruel, had already led him to disregard the guarantees of toleration by which his election to the thrones of Bohemia and Hungary had been acceded to; and on that account the Bohemians, shortly after the death of Matthias, rose in revolt, and under the leadership of Count Thurn besieged him in Vienna, until the arrival of an army under General Bouquoi forced them to retreat, and enabled him to proceed to Frankfort to receive the imperial crown. The Bohemians, notwithstanding their defeat, chose as their king the elector-palatine Frederick V., son-in-law of James I. of England, and with the assistance of Bethlen Gabor, prince of Transylvania, who revolted against Ferdinand in Hungary, virtually inaugurated the long struggle for religious liberty known as the Thirty Years’ War. Ferdinand, however, with the support of the Catholic league and the alliance of John George I., elector of Saxony, was able completely to subdue them after a short campaign, and having totally defeated them near Prague, November 8, 1620, he deprived them of their constitutional rights, banished the leading Protestant families, expelled the Reformed preachers and recalled the Jesuits, and by cruel persecutions totally quelled every manifestation of Protestant belief. But in Hungary he was not so successful as to enable him to put such extreme measures into execution; on the contrary, he thought it prudent to conclude a peace on the 3lst December 1621, by which he agreed to cede one half of the country to Bethlen Gabor, and to grant religious toleration to the other half. In Germany fortune was for a time more favourable to the Roman Catholic cause; several of the German princes had entered into a league with Christian IV. of Denmark, but that monarch was defeated by Ferdinand’s general, Wallenstein, and a peace between him and Ferdinand was concluded in 1629. Taking advantage of his opportunity, Ferdinand in the same year passed the famous Edict of Restitution, which enforced the restoration of all German ecclesiastical property that had passed into other hands since the treaty of Passau in 1552. The full execution of the edict was, however, prevented,—partly by the unwillingness of the Roman Catholic princes to give up the property of -which they had becomed possessed, partly by the intrigues of Cardinal Richelieu, who was jealous of the increasing influence of the emperor, but principally through the arrival of Gustavus Adolphus. Uniting with the Protestant princes of Germany, Gustavus inflicted a succession of defeats on Ferdinand, who, having at the urgent representations of the Catholic princes dismissed Wallenstein from the command of the imperial army, possessed no general at all adequate to cope with the genius and energy of the king of Sweden. Gustavus was subsequently joined by the elector of Saxony, and fortune failed to smile on the arms of Ferdinand even after the recall of Wallenstein, who was defeated at the battle of Lützen, 16th November 1632. The victory was dearly bought by the death of the king of Sweden, [9:9:78] but Wallenstein took little advantage of the great loss thus sustained by the Protestant cause; and the emperor, learning that he finally meditated treachery, caused him to be assassinated, February 25, 1634. In the same year the imperial army was successful at the battle of Nordlingen, and after this victory the elector of Saxony separated himself from the Swedish alliance and made peace with Ferdinand; but the Swedes continuing the struggle with great determination, and being afterwards joined by France, Ferdinand, when he died on the 15th February 1637, was uncomforted by the hope of any near fulfilment of the purpose expressed in his oath, and attempted by such ruthless persecutions and at such an expense of treasure and of human life.
