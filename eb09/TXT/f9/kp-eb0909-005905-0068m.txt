FEA, Carlo (1753-1834), an Italian archaeologist, was born at Pigna in Piedmont, 2d February 1753. At an early age he went to Rome, where he prosecuted his studies with a view to the legal profession, under the superintendence of his uncle, who was a distinguished ecclesiastic. He received the degree of doctor of laws from the university of La Sapienza, and for some time practised as an advocate; but archaeology gradually came to occupy his chief attention, and with the view of obtaining better opportunities for his antiquarian researches he in 1798 took orders. As a member of the Archaeological Society of Rome, Fea gave considerable aid to the antiquarian researches carried on under its auspices. He was also librarian to Prince Chigi. He died at Rome, 18th March 1834.

Fea revised, with the addition of notes, an Italian translation of Winckelmann’s Geschichte der Kunst, and also added notes to some of Bianconi’s works. Among his own works the principal are— Miscellanea filologica, critica, e antiquaria; L'integretd del Panteon riνendicata a Μ. Agrippa; Frammenti di fasti consolari; Iscrizioni di monumenti pubblici; and Descrizione di Roma.
