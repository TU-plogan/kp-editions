FATHIPUR SIKRI, a town in the Agra district in the North-Western Provinces of India, on the road from Agra to Jaipur, situated in 27° 58' N. lat. and 75° 5' E. long. It is a ruined city, and is interesting only from an archaeological point of view. It was founded by Akbar about 1570, as a thankoffering for the birth of a son, Selim, afterwards the emperor Jahangir, obtained through the intercession of a famous Mahometan saint. The principal building is the great mosque, which is said by Fergusson to be hardly surpassed by any in India. “It measures 550 feet east and west by 470 feet north and south, over all. The mosque itself, 250 feet by 80 feet, is crowned by three domes. In its courtyard, which measures 350 feet by 440 feet, stand two tombs. One is that of Selim Chisti [the holy man above mentioned], built of white marble, and the windows with pierced tracery of the most exquisite geometrical patterns. It possesses besides a deep cornice of marble, supported by brackets of the most elaborate design. The other tomb, that of Nawâb Islâm Khân, is soberer and in excellent taste, but quite eclipsed by its surroundings. Even these parts, however, are surpassed in magnificence by the southern gateway. As it stands on a rising ground, when looked at from below, its appearance is noble beyond that of any portal attached to any mosque in India, perhaps in the whole world.” Fathipur Sikri was a favourite residence of Akbar throughout his reign, and his palace was one of great magnificence. After Akbar’s death, Fathipur Sikri was deserted, within 50 years of its foundation. The buildings are situated within a walled inclosure about seven miles in circumference. They are now all more or less in ruins. The town at present contains 8513 inhabitants.
