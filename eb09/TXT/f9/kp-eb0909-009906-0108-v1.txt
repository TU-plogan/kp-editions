FERNANDEZ, Juan, a Spanish navigator and discoverer. While navigating the coasts of South America it occurred to him that the south winds thatalm03t constantly prevailed near the shore, and retarded the voyages between Peru and Chili, might not exist further out at sea. His idea proved to be correct, and by the help of the trade winds and some currents at a distance from the coast he made a voyage with so great rapidity that he was apprehended on a charge of sorcery. His inquisitors, however, accepted, with a readiness far from common, his natural explanation of the seeming marvel, and he was set at liberty. During one of his voyages in 1563 Fernandez discovered the two islands which now bear his name, He was so enchanted with their beauty and fertility that he solicited the concession of them from the Spanish Government. It was granted in 1572, but a colony which he endeavoured to establish at the largest of them soon broke up, leaving ι behind them a number of goats, the progeny of which still continue on the islands. In 1574 Fernandez discovered the islands of St Felix and St Ambrose, and his companions who survived him affirmed that during a voyage in 1576 in the southern ocean he came in sight of a continent, which must have been either Australia or New Zealand if the discovery is to be accepted as a fact, but more probably it was either a delusion or an invention of his followers. See Alexander Dalrymple, An Historical Collection of the several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean, London, 1769-71.
