FIORILLO, Johann Dominicus (1748-1821), German painter and historian of art, was born at Hamburg, October 13, 1748. He received his first instructions in art at an academy of painting at Baireuth; and in 1761, to continue his studies, he went first to Rome, where for four years he was the pupil of Batoni, and next to Bologna, where he studied under Bigari and Lulli. He distinguished himself sufficiently to attain in 1769 admission to the academy of that city. Returning soon after to Germany, he obtained the appointment of historical painter to the court of Brunswick. In 1781 he removed to Göttingen, occupied himself as a drawing-master, and was named in 1784 keeper of the collection of prints at the university library. He was appointed professor extraordinary in the philosophical faculty in 1799, and ordinary professor in 1813. During this period he had made himself known as a writer by ths publication of his Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste, in 5 vols. (1798-1808). This was followed in 1815 to 1820 by the Geschichte der zeichnenden Künste in Deutschland und den vereinigten Niederlanden, in 4 vols. These works, though not attaining to any high mark of literary excellence, are esteemed for the information collected in them, especially on the subject of art in the later Middle Ages. Fiorillo practised his art almost till his death, but has left no memorable masterpiece. The most noticeable of l.is [9:9:222] paintings is perhaps the Surrender of Briseis. He died at Göttingen, September 10, 1821.
