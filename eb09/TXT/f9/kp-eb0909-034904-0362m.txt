FLÜGEL, Johann Gottfried (1788-1855), a German lexicographer, was born at Barby near Magdeburg, 22d November 1788. He was originally a merchant’s clerk, but emigrating to America in 1810, he made a special study of the English language, and returning to Germany in 1819, he was in 1824 appointed professor of the English language in the university of Leipsic. In 1838 he became American consul, and subsequently representative and correspondent of many literary and scientific institutions of America. He died 24th June 1855.

The fame of Flügel rests chiefly on his Vollständige englisch-deutsche und deutsch-englische Wörterbuch, first published in 2 vols, at Leipsic in 1830, which has had an extensive circulation not only in Germany but in England and America. Among his other works are— Vollständige cngl. Sprachlehre; Triglotte, oder Kaufmännisches Wörterbuch in drei Sprachen, deutsch, englisch, und französisch; Kleines Kaufmännisches Handwörterbuch in drei Sprachen; and Praktisches Handbuch der cngl. Handelscorrcspon-denz. All these have passed through several editions.
