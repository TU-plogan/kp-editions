FYT, Johannes (1609-1661), the best painter of animals and game after Franz Snyders, was born at Antwerp and christened August 19, 1609. He was registered apprentice to Hans van den Berghe in 1621. That he should have been placed thus early under the tuition of a man who held but a humble station amongst his artist contemporaries can only be explained by stating that Van den Berghe was the friend of Fyt’s father and had already taught Jacques Fyt, Johannes’s brother. Professionally Van den Berghe was a restorer of old pictures rather than a painter of new ones. At twenty Johannes Fyt entered the guild of St Luke as a master, and from that time till his death in 1661, he produced a vast number of pictures in which the bold facility of Snyders is united to the powerful effects of Rembrandt, and harmonies of gorgeous tone are not less conspicuous than freedom of touch and a true semblance of nature. There never was such a master of technical processes as Fyt in the rendering of animal life in its most varied forms. He may have been less correct in outline, less bold in action than Snyders, but he was much more skilful and more true in the reproduction of the coat of deer, dogs, greyhounds, hares, and monkeys, whilst in realizing the plumage of peacocks, woodcocks, ducks, hawks, and cocks and hens, he had not his equal, nor was any artist even of the Dutch school more effective in relieving his compositions with accessories of tinted cloth, porcelain ware, vases, and fruit. He was not clever at figures, and he sometimes trusted for these to the co-operation of Cornelius Schut or Willeborts, whilst his architectural backgrounds were sometimes executed by Quellyn. Silenus amongst Fruit and Flowers, in the Harrach collection at Vienna, Diana and her Nymphs with the Produce of the Chase, in the Belvedere at Vienna, and Dead Game and Fruit in front of a Triumphal Arch, belonging to Baron Anselm von Rothschild at Vienna, are specimens of the co-operation respectively of Schut, Willeborts, and Quellyn. They are also Fyt’s masterpieces. The earliest dated work of the master is a cat grabbing at a piece of dead poultry near a hare and birds, belonging to Baron Cetto at Munich, and executed in 1644. The latest is a Dead Snipe with Ducks, of 1660, sold with the Jäger collection at Cologne in 1871. Great power is shown in the bear and boar hunts at Munich and Ravensworth castle. A Hunted Roedeer with Dogs in the Water, in the Berlin Museum, has some of the life and more of the roughness of Snyders, but lacks variety of tint and finish. A splendid specimen is the Page and Parrot near a table covered with game, guarded by a dog staring at a monkey, in the collection of Sir Richard Wallace. It is curious that Antwerp should possess only two examples of Fyt. The Madrid Museum contains 11, the Lichtenstein Gallery at Vienna 8, the Berlin, Vienna, and Dresden Museums 5 each, the Louvre 3, and the London National Gallery 1. With the needle and the brush Fyt was equally clever. He etched 16 plates, and those representing dogs are of their kind unique. (j. a. c.)
