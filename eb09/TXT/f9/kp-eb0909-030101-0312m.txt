FLÉCHIER, Esprit (1632-1710), bishop of Nismes, a respectable author, and one of the most celebrated preachers of his age, was born at Pernes, department of Vaucluse, on the 10th of June 1632, and educated at Tarascon sur Rhône, in the college of the Fathers of the Congregation of Christian doctrine, of which his uncle, Hercule Audifret, also famous in his time for his talents as a preacher, was general. After having gone through the ordinary course of studies, Fléchier entered the Congregation, and, according to the constitution of the order, was immediately employed in teaching. In 1659 he became a professor of rhetoric at Narbonne, and there pronounced the funeral oration of Μ. de Rebé, archbishop of that city. A few months afterwards, the death of his uncle called him to Paris, where he laid aside the habit of the doctrinaire, and at first followed the humble occupation of a parochial catechist. He soon made himself known by his poetical compositions in Latin and French. In 1660, he addressed to Cardinal Mazarin a poem called Carmen Eucharisticum, celebrating the Peace of the Pyrenees; the following year he sang the birth of the dauphin in another poem (Genethliacon) ; but what first made him famous was a description in Latin verse of a brilliant tournament (carrousel), Circus Regius, given by Louis XIV. in 1662. Chapelain, the most influential critic of that time, brought his name under the notice of Colbert, with the remark, “Fléchier est encore un très bon poète latin.” He was now intrusted with the education of Louis Urbain Lefevre de Caumartin, afterwards intendant of finances and counsellor of state: and as the house of his pupil’s father was then frequented by the most important personages both of the court and the city, Fléchier was introduced into the best society, and soon made many friends. He had to accompany Caumartin and his family to Clermont, where the king had ordered the Grands Jours to be held (1665), and where Caumartin was sent as keeper of the seals and representative of the sovereign. There he wrote his curious Mémoires sur les Grand Jours d'Auvergne, first published in 1844 by Gonod, in which he relates, in a half romantic, half historical form, the proceedings of this extraordinary court of justice. The duke of Montausier, who had become his patron, now procured for him the situation of lecteur to the dauphin. The [9:9:302] sermons of Fléchier increased his reputation, which was afterwards raised to the highest pitch by his funeral orations. Having been chosen to pronounce that of Madame de Montausier (1672), he displayed so great ability on the occasion that in the following year he was made a member of the French Academy, along with Racine. The funeral oration of the Duchesse d’Aiguillon (1675), and, above all, that of Turenne (1676), are, with that of Madame de Montausier, his masterpieces in that branch of literature. The favours of the court now poured in upon Fléchier. The king gave him successively the abbacy of St Leverin, in the diocese of Poitiers, the office of almoner to the dauphiness, and in 1685 the bishopric of Lavaur, from which he was in 1687 promoted to that of Nismes. Here Fléchier had occasion for the daily exercise of his great qualities, gentleness and moderation. The edict of Nantes had been repealed two years before; but the Calvinists were still very numerous at Nismes, and the sincerity of the conversion of such as had made abjuration was at best but doubtful. Fléchier, by his prudent conduct, in which zeal was tempered with charity, succeeded in bringing over some of them to his views, and made himself esteemed and beloved even by those who declined to change their faith. During the troubles in the Cévennes, he softened to the utmost of his power the rigour of the edicts, and showed himself so sensible of the evils of persecution, and so indulgent even to what he regarded as error, that his memory was long held in veneration amongst the Protestants of that district. In the famine which succeeded the winter of 1709, he did much to alleviate the prevalent distress, by assisting the poor in his diocese without regard to their religious tenets, declaring that all alike were his children. He died at Montpellier on the 16th February 1710, at the advanced age of seventy-eight. Pulpit eloquence is the branch of belles lettres in which Fléchier excelled. He is indeed far below Bossuet, whose robust and sublime genius had no rival in that age; he does not equal Bourdaloue in earnestness of thought and vigour of expression; nor can he rival the philosophical depth or the insinuating and impressive eloquence of Massillon. But he is always ingenious, often witty, and nobody has carried further than he the harmony of diction,—a quality which is sometimes marred, it must be confessed, by an affectation of symmetry and a love of antithesis at variance with the principles of good taste. His two historical works, the histories of Theodosius and of Ximenes, are more remarkable for elegance of style than for the accuracy and comprehensive insight which are the chief requisites of a historian.

The following is a list of Fléchier’s works, in the order of publication :—1. La Vie du Cardinal Commendon, Paris, 1671, 4to (also published in Latin, 1699, 12mo); 2. Histoire de Théodose-leGrand, Paris, 1679, 4to; 3. De Casibus Virorum Illustrium autorc Antonio Maria Gratiano, opera et studio Sp. Flecherii, Paris, 1680, 4to; 4. Oraisons funèbres, Paris, 1681, 4to and 12mo; 5. Panégyriques des Sainis, Paris, 1690, 4to; 6. Histoire du Cardinal Ximenes, Paris, 1694, 4to; 7. Sermons de morale prêches devant le Roi, avec des Discojirs synodaux et les Sermons prêchés par Fléchier aux États de Languedoc et dans sa cathédrale, 3 vols. 12mo; 8. Oeuvres p>osthumes, contenant scs Harangues, Compliments, Discours, Poésies Latines, Poésies françaises, Paris, 1712, 12mo; 9. Mandements et Lettres pastorales, Paris, 1712, 12mo; 10. Lettres choisies sur divers sujets, Paris, 1715, 2 vols. 12mo. The most complete collection of his works is that of the .Abbé Ducreux, canon of Auxerre, Nismes, 1782, 10 vols. 8vo. Another edition, with a notice of his life by A* V. Fabre of Narbonne, Paris, 1825-28, 10 vols. 8vo, is very defective. His Mémoires sur les Grands Jours d' Auvergne were published in 1844 (2d edit., with a Notice by Sainte-Beuve and an appendix by Μ. Chéruel, Paris, 1862). A MS. in the French National Library (Suppl. fr., No. 1016, fol.) contains a few compositions by Fléchier, both in prose and in verse, which are as yet unpublished. For Fléchier’s biography, see L. Juillard du J any, Oraison funèbre d ’ E. Fléchier, évêque de Nîmes, Paris, 1710, 4to; Ch. F. Trinquelague, Éloge d'E. Fléchier, évêque de Nîmes, Nismes and Paris, 1777, 8vo.
