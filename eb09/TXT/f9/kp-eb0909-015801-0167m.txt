FILANGIERI, Carlo (1783-1867), an Italian general, son of the economist Gaetano Filangieri, was born at Naples in 1783, not long before his father’s death. In 1799 he came to France, and, through the influence of the first 1 The elaborate mop into which the hair is trained (as among certain tribes in East Africa and elsewhere) has led to the belief that its peculiar appearance is due to irregular aggregations of the follicles, but this has been disproved.

consul, was admitted to the prytanée, then the training school for young officers, where he remained for the usual period of two years. Entering the French army, he was promoted to the rank of captain on the field of Austerlitz. He afterwards connected himself with the Neapolitan army, which he accompanied to Spain (1808), where he distinguished himself by a brilliant, though not always considerate, valour. He fought many duels, one with General Franceschi, whom he killed. In 1815 he was created general by Murat, and decorated with the order of the Deux-Siciles, after being severely wounded by the Austrians while reconnoitring on the Tanaro. On the restoration of the Bourbons to the throne of Naples, Filangieri opposed the constitution of 1820, and showed himself a most decided partisan of absolute power. He, however, incurred the displeasure of Ferdinand I.; but on the accession of Ferdinand IT., he was placed at the head of the artillery and engineers. In 1848 he powerfully helped to check the revolutionary movement, by taking Messina after a terrible bombardment which lasted four days; and six months after, when the armistice imposed by England and France expired, he completed the submission of Sicily, of which he wa3 appointed governorgeneral with dictatorial powers. As a reward for his services he received the title of duke of Taormina. He died in 1867.
