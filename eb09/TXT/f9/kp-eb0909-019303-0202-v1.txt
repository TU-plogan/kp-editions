FINCK, Hermann, the nephew of the subject of last notice, has frequently been mistaken for him. The date of his birth (at Pirna in Saxony) also is uncertain, but it has recently been discovered that in 1506 he succeeded his uncle in the position of royal chapelmaster to the king of Poland. After 1553 he lived at Wittenberg, and there, in 1555, was published his collection of “wedding songs.” His most celebrated work is entitled Practica musica, exempla variorum signorum, proportionum, et canonum, judicium de tonis ac quoedam de arte suaviter et artificiose cantandi continens (Wittenberg, 1557). It is of great historic value, but very rare. The Paris library, the Vienna court library, and the Prague library possess a copy each, and there are three or four copies in the royal library at Berlin.
