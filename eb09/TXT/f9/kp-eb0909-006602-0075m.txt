FELIX, of Valois (1127-1212), one of the founders of the monastic order of Trinitarians or Redemptionists, was born in the district of Valois, France, 19th April 1127. Not long after he reached manhood he became a hermit in the forest of Galeresse, where he remained till his sixty-first year, when his disciple Jean de Matha suggested to him the idea of establishing an order of monks who should devote their lives to the redemption of Christian captives from the Mahometans. With this view they arrived at Rome about the end of 1197, and obtained the sanction of the pope for the establishment of the new order. On their return to France they founded the monastery of Cerfroi in Picardy, Felix remaining to govern and propagate the order, while Jean de Matha superintended the foreign journeys. A subordinate establishment was also founded by Felix in Paris near a chapel dedicated to St Mathurin, on which account his monks were also called St Mathurins. Felix died at Cerfroi 4th November 1212, and was canonized.
