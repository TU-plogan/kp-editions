FUGGER, the name of a Swabian family which, by remarkable energy in industry and commerce, acquired enormous wealth, and rose to high rank in the state. The founder of the family was John Fugger, a respectable master-weaver at Graben, near Augsburg. His eldest son, John, associated trade in linen with weaving in Augsburg, of which he became a citizen by marriage in 1370. Here he rose to an honourable position, being one of the twelve councillors of the guild of weavers, and an assessor of the Fehmgericht, the much dreaded secret tribunal of Westphalia. He died in 1409, leaving a fortune of 3000 florins. His eldest son, by a second marriage, Andrew, was known as “the rich Fugger,” and became the founder of a noble line, Fugger vom Reh, which died out in 1583. Jacob Fugger, the second son of John, was the first of the family who possessed a house in Augsburg, where he greatly extended the business he inherited, and was made head of the guild of weavers. After his death in 1469, his three sons, Ulrich, George, and Jacob, who were men of unusual resource and industry, added immensely to the riches he had left them. Ulrich devoted himself to trade, and his operations were so varied that even the works of Albert Dürer reached Italy by his means. Jacob worked the mines of Tyrol, and his profits were vast enough to enable him, without difficulty, to lend the archduke of Austria 150,000 florins, and to build (in Tyrol) the splendid castle of Fug-gerau. The three brothers married ladies of noble families, and were themselves raised to noble rank by the emperor Maximilian, who, being always in need of money, was delighted to honour subjects whose power of aiding him was so extensive. In return for 70,000 gulden he mortgaged to them the county of Kirchberg and the lordship of Weissen-horn; and afterwards, in carrying on war with Venice, he received from them, at the request of Pope Julius II., a subsidy of 170,000 ducats. An evidence of the generous use to which they put their wealth still survives in the Fuggerei at Augsburg,—a collection of more than 100 small houses built by the brothers and let by them at low rents to poor tenants. Jacob and the two sons of Ulrich died without heirs, so that the possessions of the family descended to the sons of George. Of these the eldest, Marcus, became a priest, and died in 1511. His two brothers, Raimund and Antonius, then represented the house, and their names were soon well known far beyond the limits of Germany, for they had commerical relations with nearly every part of the civilized world. They were vehement opponents of the Reformation, and freely spent money in support of the church. During the famous diet of Augsburg in 1530, Charles V. enjoyed the splendid hospitality of Antonius in his house in the Weinmarkt; and there is a story that the merchant astonished the emperor by lighting a fire of cinnamon with an imperial bond for money due to him. According to another anecdote, Charles remarked at a later time, when the treasury of the king of France was being shown to him, “There is a linen-weaver in Augsburg who could pay all that out of his own purse.” Whether these things are true or not, the emperor was certainly impressed by the extraordinary resources of the two citizens. He not only made over to them the mortgaged properties of Kirchberg and ΛVeissenhorn, but created them [9:9:812] counts and invested them with princely privileges. In return for the help they gave him in his expedition against the pirates of Algiers in 1535, he conferred on them the right of issuing a gold and silver coinage of their own; and the right was repeatedly exercised. Their princely rank did not prevent them from continuing their mercantile career, and when Antonius died in 1560 he left six million gold crowns, besides a vast amount of property of various kinds in Europe, Asia, and America. He and his brother Raimund (who died in 1535) were the founders of two great lines which are still continued. The privileges conferred on the family by Charles V. were confirmed and increased by Ferdinand II.; and since that time, although no member either of the Raimund or the Antonius line has risen to the highest distinction in any department, many of them have done honourable service to the state, and have been famous for their liberality. The fortunes of the family are often cited in evidence of the prosperity of Germany before the country was nearly ruined by the Thirty Years’ War. In 1593 a collection of portraits of the chief representatives of the Fugger race, engraved by D. Custos of Antwerp, was issued at Augsburg. Editions with 127 portraits appeared at Augsburg in 1618 and 1620, the former accompanied by α genealogy in Latin, the latter by one in German. An edition which was published at Ulm in 1754 includes 139 portraits.
