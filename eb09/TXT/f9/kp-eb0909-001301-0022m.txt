FALK, Johann Daniel (1768-1826), a German author and philanthropist, was born at Dantzic, 20th October 1768. His parents, who were in poor circumstances, gave him only a scanty education, and strongly opposed his desire to enter one of the learned professions; but notwithstanding their discouragement he managed not only to make himself acquainted with the best German writers but also to learn French and English. After attending for some time the gymnasium of his native town, he entered the university of Halle with the view of studying theology, but preferring, on second thoughts, a non-professional life, he gave up his theological studies and went to live at Weimar. There he published a volume of satires which procured him the notice and friendship of Wieland, and admission into the literary circles of the city. On the invasion of Germany by the French, Falk joined the army, and so distinguished himself at the battle of Jena that the duke of Weimar created him a counsellor of legation. In 1813 he succeeded in establishing a society for friends in necessity, and about the same time he founded an institute for the care and education of neglected and orphan children, which in 1829 was changed into a free public school. The first literary efforts of Falk took the form chiefly of satirical poetry, and gave promise of greater future excellence than was ever completely fulfilled, for as his later pieces were directed more against individuals than the general vices and defects of society, they gradually degenerated in quality. In 1804 ho published a comedy entitled Amphitryon, which met with some success, and a tragedy entitled Prometheus, which, although in many places deficient in rhythm and melody, and in form more philosophical than dramatic, yet contains many fine thoughts expressed in language truly poetical. From 1797 to 1803 ho published a land of satirical almanac entitled Taschenbuch für Freunde des Scherzes und der Satire. In this publication he wrote a description of the hospitals of Berlin under the satirical title of Denkwürdigkeiten der Berliner Charite auf das Jahr 1797, which led to the appointment of a committee to inquire into their management, and finally to their reform. In 1806 Falk founded a critical journal under the title of Elysium und Tartarus. He also contributed largely to contemporary journals. He enjoyed the acquaintance and intimate friendship of Goethe, and his account of their intercourse was published after the death of both under the title Goethe arts naherm persönlichen Umgänge dargestellt, Leipsic, 1832. Falk died 14th February 1826.
