FLÜGEL, Gustav Lebrecht (1802-1870), a German Orientalist, was born at Bautzen, February 18, 1802. He received his early education at the gymnasium of his native town, and studied theology and philology at Leipsic. Gradually he devoted his attention chiefly to Oriental languages, which he studied especially at the universities of Vienna and Paris. In 1832 he became professor at the district school of Meissen, but ill health compelled him to resign that office in 1850, and in 1851 he went to Vienna, where he was employed in cataloguing the Oriental manuscripts of the court library. He died at Dresden, July 5, 1870.

His chief works are an edition of the Koran, originally published at Leipsic in 1834, followed by Concordantice Corani Arabicae, Leipsic, 1842; Geschichte der Araber, Leipsic, 1832-1840; Dictionary of Hadschi-Chalfa, with Latin translation and commentary, in 7 vols., London and Leipsic, 1835-1858 (published at the expense of the London Oriental Translation Committee); Mani, seine Lehren und seine Schriften, Leipsic, 1862; Die grammatischen Schulen der Araber, Leipsic, 1862. An edition of Kitâb-al-Fihrist, prepared by Flügel, was published posthumously at Leipsic in 1871, and he also edited various other Oriental works.
