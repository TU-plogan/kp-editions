FLANNEL (French flanelle, German Planet), an open woollen stuff of various degrees of fineness, from patent flannel, which does not shrink in washing, to baize, which is a coarse woollen stuff, or flannel with a long nap, first introduced into England, together with serge, by the Flemings. Domett is another variety of flannel, the warp of which is made of cotton, and the woof of wool. It is very thin, and is used for linings and for shrouds for coffins. The manufacture of flannel is almost the same as that of other woollen goods, though there are certain wools which are more used for flannel than for any other textiles. For instance, a short staple wool of fine quality from a Southdown variety of the Sussex breed is principally in favour with the flannel-makers at Rochdale, as also the wool from the Norfolk breed, a cross between the Southdown and Norfolk sheep. In Wales the short staple wool of the mountain sheep is used, aud in Ireland that of the Wicklow variety of the Cottagh breed. Nearly 2000 persons are employed in this section of woollen manufactures, the chief seat of the industry being Rochdale in Lancashire, while blankets, a special branch of the flannel trade, are extensively woven at Dewsbury in Yorkshire. The wool for these is chiefly obtained from the coarse staples of the Mysore breed in India. Nearly the whole population at Llanidloes and Newton, in Montgomeryshire, finds occupation in flannel weaving, the Welsh flannels having attained a very high reputation. It is also manufactured at Rathdrum, Wicklow, Ireland.

A very considerable trade is carried on by England in flannel, as is shown by the exports for the year 1877, viz:—

Flannel is highly recommended by medical men as a clothing, both in hot and cold countries, from its properties of promoting insensible perspiration, which, being absorbed by the material, is immediately distributed through the whole thickness of the substance, and thus exposed over a very large surface, to be carried off by the atmosphere. Dr Black assigns as a reason why flannel and other substances of the same kind keep the body warm, that they compose a rare and spongy mass, the fibres of which touch each other so lightly that the heat moves slowly through the interstices. These being filled up with air, and that too in a stagnant state, give little assistance in conducting the heat.
