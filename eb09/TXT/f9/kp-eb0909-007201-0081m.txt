FÉNELON, Bertrand de Salignac (Ί—1589), Marquis de La Mothe, a French diplomatist who was ambassador to England during the reign of Elizabeth. At the request of Charles IX. he endeavoured to excuse to Elizabeth the massacre of St Bartholomew as a necessity caused by a plot which had been laid against the life of the king of France. For some time after the death of Charles IX. Fénelon was continued in his office, but he was recalled in 1575 when Catherine de’ Medici wished to bring about a marriage between Elizabeth and the duke of Alençon, and thought that another ambassador would have a better chance of success in the negotiation. In 1582 Fénelon again arrived in England, charged with a private commission from the king of France, chiefly with the view of obtaining the liberation of Mary queen of Scots on the promise of a French alliance; but Elizabeth saw reason to doubt the king’s sincerity, and Fénelon had to leave England without gaining his purpose. He died in 1589.

Fénelon is the author of a number of writings, among which those of general importance are Mémoires touchant l'Angleterre et la Suisse, ou Sommaire de la négociation faite en Angleterre, l'an 1571 (containing a number of the letters of Charles and his mother, relating to Queen Elizabeth, Queen Mary, and the Bartholomew massacre), published in the Mémoires of Castelnau, Paris, 1659; Négociations de La Mothe Fénelon et de Michel, sieur de Mauvissiére, en Angleterre; and Dépêches de Μ. de La Mothe Fénelon, Instructions au sieur de La Mauυissiere, both contained in the edition of Castelnau’s Mémoires, published at Brussels in 1731. The correspondence of Fénelon was published at Paris in 1838-41, in 7 vols. 8vo.
