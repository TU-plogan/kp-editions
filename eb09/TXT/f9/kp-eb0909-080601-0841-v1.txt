FUCHS, Leonhard (1501-1566), a celebrated German physician, and one of the fathers of scientific botany, was born at Wembdingen in Bavaria, January 17,1501. At the age of five years he lost his father, but under the care of his mother he early made great progress in learning. In his tenth year he was sent to school at Heilbronn, whence, a twelvemonth later, he was removed to Erfurt. After a year and a half he was admitted a student of the university of that town, which in 1521 conferred on him the degree of “baccalaureus.” During the next 18 months he gave lessons in Latin and literature in his native town. He then repaired to the university of Anspach, where in 1521 he was created a master of arts. About the same time he espoused the doctrines of the Reformation. Having in 1524 received his diploma as doctor of medicine, he practised for two years in Munich. He became in 1526 professor of medicine at Ingolstadt, and in 1528 physician to the margrave of Anspach. In Anspach he was the means of saving the lives of many during the epidemic locally known as the “English sweating-sickness.” By the duke of Würtemberg Fuchs was, in 1535, appointed to the professorship of medicine at the university of Tübingen, a post held by him till his death, which took place May 10, 1566. Among his numerous writings are the following :—

Thriverius, G. Ryf∏us, C. Egenolphus, G. Rufinus, G. Puteanus, and S. Montius.
