In 1752 he entered a school of the Jesuits at Rheims, where he manifested a great aptitude for mathematics and physical science. He commenced his noviciate two years afterwards, and in testimony of his admiration for the apostle of India added Xavier to his surname. On the expiry of his noviciate he became professor at Luxembourg, and afterwards at Liége. In 1764 he was appointed to the professorship of theology at Tyrnau in Hungary, but in 1771 he returned to Belgium and continued to discharge his professorial duties at Liége till the suppression of the Jesuits in 1773. The remainder of his life he devoted to study, travel, and literature.
