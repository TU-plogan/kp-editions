FOIX (Lat. Fuxum), a town of France, capital of an arrondissement, and also of the department of Ariége, is situated on the left bank of the Ariége, in the gorge of a narrow valley at the foot of the Pyrenees, 44 miles south of Toulouse. It is badly built, and its streets are uneven and irregular. In the middle of the town rises the old castle of the counts of Foix, situated on a rock 50 feet [9:9:354] high, and possessing three fine towers, all anterior to the 15th century. The principal industries of the town are connected with the manufacture of iron, but there are also breweries, tanneries, and dyeworks. Foix is the seat of a tribunal of justice of the first instance, and possesses a communal college, a teachers’ seminary, a library connected with the prefecture, a prison, and a correction-house. The population in 1876 was 5127.
