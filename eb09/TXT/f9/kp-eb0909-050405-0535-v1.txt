FRÄHN, Christian Martin, a numismatist and historian, was born at Rostock, 4th June 1782, and died at St Petersburg, 28th August 1851. He commenced his Oriental studies under Tychsen at the university of Rostock, and afterwards prosecuted them at Göttingen and Tübingen. Ho became a Latin master in Pestalozzi’s famous institute in 1804, returned home in 1806, and in the following year was chosen to the chair of Oriental languages in the Russian university of Kasan. Though in 1815 he was invited to succeed Tychsen at Rostock, he preferred to go to St Petersburg, where he became director of the Asiatic museum and councillor of state. The indefatigable[9:9:505] ardour with which he pursued his studies is shown by the number of his works, which altogether amount to more than 150, great and small.

Among the more important are— Numophylacium orientale Poto-tianum, 1813; De numorum Bulgharicorum fonte antiquissimo, 1816; Das Mohammedanische. Münzkabinct des Asiatischen Museum der Kaiser! Akademie der Wissenschaften zu St Petersburg, 1821; Numi cufici ex variis muscis selecti, 1823; Notice d’une centaine d’ouvrages arabes, <L∙c., qui manquent en grande partie aux bibliothèques de VEurope, 1834; and Nova Supplementa ad recensionem Num. Mιcham. Acad. Imp. Sei. Petropolitanoe, 1855 (∣>osthuιnous). A description of some medals struck by the Samanid and Bouid princes (Kasan, 1804) deserves special mention, as the author composed it in Arabic because he had no Latin types at command.
