FONTANA, Domenico (1543-1607), Italian architect and mechanician, was born at Mili, a village on the lake of Como, in 1543. After a good training in mathematics, he went in 1563 to join his elder brother, then studying architecture at Rome. He made rapid progress, and was taken into the service of Cardinal Montai to, for whom he erected a chapel in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore and the Villa Negroni. When the cardinal’s pension was stopped by the pope, Gregory XIII., Fontana volunteered to complete the works in hand at his own expense. The cardinal being soon after elected pope, under the name of Sixtus V., he immediately appointed Fontana his chief architect. Amongst the works executed by him were the Lateran Palace, the palace of Monte Cavallo (the Quirinal), the Vatican Library, &c. But the undertaking which brought Fontana the highest repute was the removal of the great Egyptian obelisk, brought to Rome in the reign of Caligula, w hich was lying in the circus of the Vatican, and its erection in front of St Peter’s. This he accomplished in 1586. After the death of Sixtus V., charges were brought against Fontana of misappropriation of public moneys, and Clement VIII. dismised him from his post (1592). This appears to have been just in time to save the Colosseum from being converted by Fontana into a huge cloth factory, according to a project of Sixtus V. Fontana was then called to Naples, and accepted the appointment of architect to the viceroy, the count of Miranda. At Naples he built the royal palace, constructed several canals, and projected a new harbour and bridge, which he did not live to execute. The only literary work left by this architect is his account of the removal of the obelisk, 1589. He died at Naples in 1607, and was honoured with a pompous funeral in the church of St Ann.
