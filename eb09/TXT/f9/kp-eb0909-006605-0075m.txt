FELL, John (1625-86), bishop of Oxford, was the son of Dr Samuel Fell, dean of Christ Church, and was born at Longworth, in Berkshire, June 23, 1625. He passed from the free school of Thame to Christ Church, Oxford, at the age of eleven, took his degree of B.A. in 1640, and three years later that of M.A. He served in the royal garrison of Oxford, and attained the rank of ensign. He afterwards took holy orders; and being ejected by the parliamentary visitors from his student’s place, he lived in retirement at Oxford during the Commonwealth, privately keeping up the services of the Church of England, and administering the sacraments to many Royalists. At the Restoration he was made in rapid succession prebendary of Chichester, canon and dean of Christ Church. He had already obtained his degree of D.D., and was also chaplain to the king. In 1666 he was appointed vice-chancellor of the university, and he filled this post for several successive years. Dr Fell set himself diligently to reform his college, to clear it of all remains of what he regarded as Puritan “hypocrisy and nonsense,” to promote learning of all kinds, and to re-establish strict discipline. He did much for the improvement of the university press, therein carrying out the designs of Archbishop Laud. He zealously maintained the privileges of the university, and in so doing made himself unpopular with the townsmen. He also distinguished himself as a benefactor to the college by making and promoting many important additions to its buildings. Having shown himself a good scholar, and an earnest upholder of the Church of England, he was nominated in 1676 bishop of Oxford. He was allowed, however, still to hold his deanery of Christ Church in commendam. Fell, as a good Aristotelian, was alarmed at the institution and innovations of the Royal Society, and encouraged Stubbe to write against it, making very grave charges against its members. Among his numerous publications were a Life of Dr Henry Hammond (1660), a Latin translation of Wood’s History and Antiquities of the University of Oxford (1674), and a critical edition of the Greek Testament with many various readings (1675). This edition was twice reprinted at Leipsic, and at Oxford in 1703. It was followed in 1707 by the more important edition of Mill. When he had held the see of Oxford for ten years, Fell’s health failed him, and anxiety about the changes attempted in the church by James II. hastened his end. He died at Oxford, July 10, 1686, and his remains were interred in the cathedral.
