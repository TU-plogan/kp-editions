FIESOLE, a small episcopal city of Italy, occupying the site of the ancient Faesulae, on the crown of a hill that rises above the Arno, about three miles to the west of Florence. In size it is little more than a village, but its historical interest is of considerable scope. The principal building is the cathedral, which was commenced by Bishop Giacomo Bavaro in 1028, and dedicated to San Pietro Romolo, a martyr under Nero. It is a small basilica, consisting of a nave with narrow aisles, a transept, a raised choir, and a crypt noticeable for the uncommon character of its capitals. Among its adornments are an altarpiece and a bust of Bishop Salutati by Mino di Fiesole. The church of St Maria Primerana, with a terra-cotta tabernacle by L. della Robbia, San Allesandro, with its twelve cipollino columns, the Franciscan convent, the episcopal palace, and the town-hall or palazzo del pretorio, dating from the 13th century, are all worthy of notice. The convent probably occupies the site of the old arx or citadel; behind the cathedral there are extensive remains of a large Roman theatre, discovered in 1809 and laid bare in 1872-3; and a few dilapidated portions of the ancient Etruscan fortification still stand on the northern brow of the hill. Between the little city and Floιence the church of San Domenico di Fiesole marks the site of the monastery famous as the residence of Fra Angelico (see next article); not far from the church is the villa where Walter Savage Landor dwelt many years amid the scenes of Boccaccio’s Decameron; and further up the hill is the yet more celebrated Villa Mozzi, the favourite haunt of Lorenzo the Magnificent. The present inhabitants of Fiesole are largely employed in straw plaiting. They number, according to the census of 1871, 3467 in the city, and 13,180 in the commune.

Faesulae has a great mythical history, according to which it is the oldest city in the world. Its real origin is unknown, but it was evidently an Etruscan site long before the Roman conquest. It became of some note in the Gallic and Punic wars, and was afterwards selected by Sulla for the settlement of a body of his veterans. Twenty years later these colonists rendered themselves formidable by the support which they gave to Catiline, and the town was chosen as his headquarters in the struggle against Metellus and Antony. The story of Catiline and his exploits has been developed into an elaborate legend by Malespini and other Fiesolan historians. Catellino, as he is called, wages war against Fiorino, king of Rome; the king is slain, but the Faesulan party is ultimately defeated by Julius Caesar, and anew city, Fiorenza Magna (Florence), is founded by the conqueror, and named in honour of Fiorino. At a later date Faesulae, continues the story, was rebuilt by Attila, and Florence destroyed. From Procopius we know that the little city, while occupied by Witiges and his Goths, did stand a long siege by the forces of Belisarius. According to the common account it was ‘ ‘ destroyed” by the Florentines in the 11th or 12th century; but the statement is open to question, and the destraction at any rate cannot have been very complete. Among the more eminent natives of Fiesole are Francesco Ferrucci, the great captain, and Francesco Ferracci, the first sculptor in porphyry.
