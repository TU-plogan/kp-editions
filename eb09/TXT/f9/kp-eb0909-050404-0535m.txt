FRA DIAVOLO is the popular name given by his countrymen to the most notorious and dreaded of modem Italian brigands; and the name, associated during his lifetime with the political revolutions of southern Italy, has acquired a world-wide celebrity since it became the title of a favourite French opera. His real name was Michele Pezza. It would be as hopeless to fix the precise dates in his career as to determine those in the lives of Rob Roy or Jonathan Wild. He is stated, however, to have been born at ItrL His crimes became invested with a more general and political interest in 1799. At that time, from the frequency and audacity of his robberies and murders along the frontier of the Terra di Lavoro, he became known as Fra Diavolo, the popular superstition investing him with the blended attributes of a monk and a demon. When the kingdom of Naples was overrun by the troops of the French Republic, Fra Diavolo, acting in concert with the head of the Bourbon partisans, Cardinal Ruffo, waged a fierce aud untiring war against the French soldiers, whenever his superior knowledge of the localities afforded the prospect of his being able to do so with effect. He continued for a considerable period in absolute possession of the line of communication from the Garigliano to Portello, falling upon and massacring the French Government couriers, and all whom he suspected of conveying information to the military or civil functionaries of the Republic. At one moment he succeeded in completely interrupting all communication between Naples and Rome. Like his fellow agents under Cardinal Ruffo—like Mammone, Pronio, Sciarpa Guar-riglia—he styled himself “the faithful servant and subject of his Sicilian Majesty.” As the turning point in Fra Diavolo’s career must be regarded the arrival in Naples of Joseph Bonaparte, and the establishment of the extraordinary tribunals charged with the repression of this half civil half political brigandage. Fra Diavolo was sentenced to death, and a price was set on his head. After spreading terror through Calabria by his deeds of cruelty he had passed over into Sicily, but soon returned to the mainland at the head of 300 liberated convicts placed at his disposal by the Bourbon Government. His landing at Spelonza with these ruffians was marked by unusual excesses, but the French troops were everywhere on the alert to capture him, and he was compelled to seek refuge amongst the woods and mountains of Lenola. During a period of two months he succeeded in evading his pursuers, always in the hope of making his way back to Sicily. A t length, exhausted by hunger and requiring medical aid, he repaired in disguise to the village of Baronissi, but was there recognized and put to death. It is stated that on his person were found papers from Queen Caroline of Naples and Admiral Sidney Smith, those from the former recognizing his rank as colonel in the Bourbon army, and that in his last moments he cursed both his employers and his own folly which had led him to engage in such a reckless enterprise. The most authentic source for the career of Fra Diavolo is Colletta’s History of Naples, which the English reader may consult in the version, equally faithful and spirited, of Miss Horner.
