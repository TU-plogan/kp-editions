FERNANDO PO, or Fernao do Pao, an island on the W. coast of Africa, lying in the Bight of Biafra, about 20 miles from the mainland, in 3° 12' N. lat. and 3° 48' E. long. It is about 44 miles in length from N.N.E. to S.S. W., and about 20 in breadth. The coasts are steep and rocky, and the interior is mountainous. A ridge of mountains towards the centre of the island rises to the height of 8000 feet, and is terminated at each extremity by a peaked mountain,—the northern one (Ste Isabelle)attaining a height of 10,700 feet. The southern extremity of the island is also intersected by several steep mountains, varying from 1000 to 3000 feet. These mountains are covered, most of them to their summits, as are the intervening valleys, with dense forests of shrubs and lofty trees of luxuriant growth. The rocks are of volcanic origin; and the soil is rich and fertile, producing rice, sugar-cane, cotton, tobacco, yams, and palms. Antelopes, monkeys, sheep, goats, fowls, turtle, and fish are abundant. The climate is salubrious, though the rainy season lasts from May to December, and is succeeded by a season of dense fogs. The principal harbour, Port Clarence on the northern shore, is frequented by English vessels, especially for palm-oil. This island was discovered in 1471 by a Portuguese navigator, whose name it bears. It was taken possession of by Spain in 1778, but was abandoned in 1782. The English formed a settlement on the island in 1827, and made use of it as a harbour for the ships of war sent to watch the slave traffic, but they relinquished it in 1834; the Spaniards resumed possession of it in 1844, and changed its name to Puerto de Isabel. The population is about 15,000, and is composed partly of half-breed Protuguese, negroes formerly freed by the British, a few Europeans, and the native inhabitants called Edeeyahs or Bobies, who are in the proportion of ten to one of all the others, and whose jealous hostil ity perhaps, as much as the reputed insalubrity of the climate, has prevented the colonization of the island by Europeans. The Baptist missionaries who settled on the island during its occupation by the British were expelled by the Spaniards in 1858. See Benedetti, “Les îles espagnoles du golfe de Guinée,” in Bull. de la Soc. de Geogr., 1869.
