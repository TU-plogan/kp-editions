FÉCAMP, a seaport-town of France, department of Seine-Inférieure, is situated on the English Channel, at the mouth of the small river Fécamp, 23 miles N.N.E. of Havre. The town consists almost entirely of one street, which is upwards of two miles in length. It occupies the bottom and sides of a narrow valley, opening out towards the sea between two high cliffs, on one of which stands a lighthouse. Its port, though small, is one of the best on the Channel, and has been greatly improved by the construction of an inner port with a fine quay. It carries on a considerable trade in Baltic and colonial produce, and in brandy and salt, and sends out vessels to the whale, cod, mackerel, and herring fisheries. In 1875 there entered the port 167 vessels, with a total tonnage of 26,321. The river affords abundant water-power for numerous cotton, oil, and other mills. Fécamp has also sugar refineries, tanneries, forges, and building docks, and manufactures of hardware, candles, and soda. The church is a large and handsome edifice; and the other principal buildings are the sea-bathing establishment, the theatre, the hospital, and the Institute for Poor Sisters. The Latin name of Fécamp was Fiscarium or Fiscanium; and the town owes its origin to a nunnery which was founded in 664, destroyed by the Normans in 841, and rebuilt for a Benedictine abbey by Richard I., duke of Normandy, in 998. The population in 1872 was 12,651.
