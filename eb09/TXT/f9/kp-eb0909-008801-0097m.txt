FERGUSSON, Sir William (1808-1877), Baronet, an eminent surgeon, the son of James Fergusson of Lochmaben, Dumfriesshire, was born at Prestonpans, East [9:9:89] Lothian, 20th March 1808. After receiving his early education at Lochmaben and the High School of Edinburgh, he entered the university of Edinburgh with the view of studying law, but soon afterwards abandoned his intention, and became a pupil of Robert Knox the celebrated anatomist. At the age of twenty he became a licentiate of the College of Surgeons, and he was elected a fellow in the following year. The ingenious fittings of a dissecting case which he had constructed by his own mechanical skill having attracted the attention of Knox, the latter engaged him as his demonstrator. While occupied in teaching anatomy he devoted his chief attention, under the direction of Knox, to the improvement of his surgical skill. In 1831 he became an extramural lecturer on surgery, and in 1836 he succeeded Liston as surgeon to the Royal Infirmary. Iu 1840 he was appointed professor of surgery in King’s College, London, and surgeon to King’s College Hospital. At first he acquired a practice in London only slowly, but after the deaths of the two Coopers and of Liston he soon held an unrivalled position in his own department. In 1849 he was appointed surgeon-in-ordinary to the Prince Consort, in 1855 surgeon-extraordinary to the Queen, and in 1866 sergeant-surgeon to the Queen. He was a fellow of the Royal Societies of Edinburgh and London, and of various medical societies. In 1865 he was created a baronet. He died at his Scottish residence in Peeblesshire, February 10, 1877. As a surgeon Fergusson’s greatest merit is that of having introduced the practice of “conservative surgery,” in many cases of diseased joints which before his time were treated by amputation. He made his diagnosis with almost intuitive certainty; and as an operator he was characterized by self-possession in the most critical circumstances, minute attention to details, and great refinement of touch, and relied more on his mechanical dexterity than on complicated instruments. Sir William Fergusson is the author of The Progress of Anatomy and Surgery in the Nineteenth Century (1867), and of a work on Practical Surgery (1st ed. 1842) which has a high reputation as a text-book.
