FELTRE, the ancient Feltria, a town of northern Italy, in the province of Belluno, and 16 miles S.W. of the town of that name. It stands on a hill at the foot of the Alps near the Piave, and is partially fortified. It possesses a beautiful town-hall with fa√ßades said to be by Palladio, a cathedral, numerous churches, an episcopal gymnasium, a diocesan school, and an orphan asylum. It has some trade in corn, wine, and oil, and manufactures of silk twist, wax, and leather. A money-lending establishment founded there in the 15 th century still exists, and is said to be the oldest in Europe. Of the old castle, which was frequently besieged in the Venetian wars of the 14th and 15th centuries, little now remains but a square tower. The population of Feltre in 1871 was 4852, and including the suburbs 6570.
