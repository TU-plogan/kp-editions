FRANCIA, José Gaspar Rodriguez, commonly called Dr Francia, dictator of Paraguay, one of the most remarkable men connected with the history of South America. The date of his birth is not definitely ascertained, but probably falls about 1757. According to one account, he was of French descent; but the truth seems to be that his father, Garcia Rodriguez França, was a native of S. Paulo in Brazil, and came to Paraguay to take charge of a plantation of black tobacco for the Government. He studied theology at the college of Cordova de Tucuman, and is said to have been for some time a professor in that faculty; but he afterwards turned his attention to the Jaw, and practised in Asuncion. Having attained a high reputation at once for ability and integrity, he was naturally selected for various important offices, and exercised great personal influence. The Robertsons, whose accounts have done so much to blacken his memory, relate how, when he was requested by one of his friends to undertake an unjust cause in his behalf, he not only refused, but went and offered his services to the man who was likely to be wronged, and by his boldness and energy secured his case. On the declaration of Paraguayan independence in 1811, he was appointed secretary to the national junta, and exercised an influence on affairs greatly out of proportion to his nominal position. When the congress or junta of 1813 changed the constitution and established a duumvirate, Dr Francia and the Gaucho general Fulgencio were elected to the office. A story is told in connexion with their installation, which recalls the self-coronation of William I. of England and Napoleon the great. In theatrical imitation of Roman custom, two curule chairs had been placed in the assembly, one of them bearing the name of Caesar and the other that of Pompey. Francia seated himself in the Caesar chair, and left his colleague to play the part of Pompey as best he might. In 1814 he secured his own election as dictator for three years, and at the end of that period he obtained the dictatorship for life. He was no mere nominal sovereign; but for the next twenty-five years he might have boasted, with even more truth than Louis XIV., “L’état e’est moi.” In the accounts which have been published of his administration we find a strange mixture of capacity and caprice, of far-sighted wisdom and reckless infatuation, strenuous endeavours after a high ideal and flagrant violations of the simplest principles of justice. He put a stop to the foreign commerce of the country, but carefully fostered its internal industries; was disposed to be hospitable to strangers from other lands, and kept them prisoners for years; lived a life of republican simplicity, and punished with Dionysian severity the slightest want of respect. As time went on he appears to have grown more arbitrary and despotic, more determined to maintain his mastery over the [9:9:689] country, and more apprehensive lest he should lose it. And yet at the time of his death it is said that he was generally regretted, and his bitterest opponents cannot deny that if he did much evil he also did much good. Deeply imbued with the principles of the French Revolution, he was a stern antagonist of the church. He abolished the Inquisition, suppressed the college of theology, did away with the tithes, and inflicted endless indignities on the priests. “What are they good for!” was his saying; “they make us believe more in the devil than in God.” He discouraged marriage both by precept and example, and left behind him several illegitimate children. For the extravagances of his later years the plea of insanity has been put forward; and it was evident that his worst characteristics were at their worst when the east wind blew. The circumstances of his death were in strange keeping with his life. He was about to sabre his doctor when he was seized with a fit, and he expired the same day, September 20, 1840. He was buried in the cathedral of Asuncion, but the spot is no longer known, and a story is told by Mr Mansfield and by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomson, to the effect that his body was dug up by some private enemies and flung into the river. On the other hand, it is well known that the greatest respect was shown to his memory by those who succeeded him in the government of Paraguay. Unfortunately for the history of his administration, Francia kept no records; and he caused all his orders to be returned to him with the word “executed” on the margin, and then to be destroyed.

The first and fullest account of Dr Francia was given to the world by two Swiss surgeons, Rengger and Longchamps', whom lie had detained from 1819 to 1825— Essai historique sur la révolution de Paraguay et la gouvernement dictatorial du docteur Francia, Paris, 1827. Their work was almost immediately translated into English under the title of The Reign of Doctor Joseph G. R. De Francia in Paraguay, 1827. About eleven years after there appeared at London Letters on Paraguay, by J. P. and W. P. Robertson, two young Scotchmen whose hopes of commercial success hail been rudely destroyed by the dictator’s interference. The account which they gave of his character and government was naturally of the most unfavourable description, and they rehearsed and emphasized their accusations in Francia's Reign of Terror, 1839, and Letters on South America, 3 vols., 1843. From the very pages of his detractors Thomas Carlyle succeeded in extracting materials for a brilliant defence of the dictator “as aman or sovereign of iron energy and industry, of great and severe labour.” It appeared in the Foreign Quarterly Review for 1843, and is reprinted in vol. iv. of the author’s Critical and Miscellaneous Essays. Comparatively little new light has since been thrown on the subject Captain Richard F. Burton gives a graphic sketch of Francia’s life and a favourable notice of his character in his Letters from the Battlefields of Paraguay, 1870, while C. A. Washburn takes up a hostile position in his History of Paraguay, 1871.
