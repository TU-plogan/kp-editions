FITZGERALD, Lord Edward (1763-1798), one of the leaders of the Society of United Irishmen, was a younger son of the first duke of Leinster, and was born at Carton Castle, near Dublin, October 15, 1763. At ten years of age he lost his father, and, his mother marrying again, the family soon after settled in France. Lord Edward was carefully educated by his stepfather, Mr Ogilvie, chiefly with a view to the profession of a soldier. Returning to England in 1779 he entered the English army, and in 1781 he sailed with his regiment for America, where he soon obtained the appointment of aide-de-camp on the staff of Lord Rawdon. He served in the war with no little [9:9:271] reputation for personal courage, readiness of resource, and humane feeling. He was severely wounded at the battle of Eutaw Springs. After the surrender of York Town he joined the staff of General O’Hara at St Lucia, and the same year (1783) returned to Ireland. He was soon returned as member for Athy to the Irish parliament; but the high hopes which he had cherished of serving his country faded away at the spectacle of political corruption and suppression of all genuine representation by the penal laws against Roman Catholics. In 1787 he set out for a visit to the south of Europe, went afterwards to America, and in 1790 returned to England, and soon resumed his seat in the Irish parliament. The French Revolution had broken out, aud Lord Edward was one of those ardent spirits that welcomed with enthusiasm the promise of its first days. In 1792 he was attracted to Paris, and made the acquaintance of the most famous leaders of the Revolution. Having publicly renounced his title of nobility and avowed his sympathy with the republicans, he was dismissed, with other officers, from the English army. It was during this visit to Paris that he was introduced to the lady then known as “Pamela,” the daughter of Madame de Genlis, by the duke of Orleans ( “Égalité ”). In December 1792 they were married at Tournay, and returned to Ireland in January 1793. After a period of singular happiness spent in a country home, his sympathies with the struggles of his countrymen led him out to the troubled arena of politics. He joined in 1796 the society of United Irishmen, was sent to France to negotiate a treaty with the Directory for a French invasion of Ireland, and urged on with the utmost zeal the preparations for an Irish insurrection. But the scheme was betrayed, several of the leaders were arrested, and Fitzgerald concealed himself in a house at Dublin, still continuing to direct the movement. A price was set on his head, the place of his retreat was discovered, and after a severe struggle he was captured by police officers (May 19, 1798) and committed to prison. There he died on the 4th of June, of the wounds which he had received; a bill of attainder was immediately passed against him, and his estates were confiscated; but the attainder was at a later time reversed. His widow married Mr Pitcairn, American consul at Hamburg; but the union was an unhappy one, and ended in a separation by mutual consent. Lady Fitzgerald henceforward lived in retirement at Montauban till 1830, when she removed to Paris, Louis Philippe, the associate of her childhood, having become king of the French. He, however, refused to see her, and she died poor in 1831. An interesting narrative of The Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, by Thomas Moore, was published in 1831, in 2 vols. 8vo. A cheap reprint in 1 vol. was issued in 1875.
