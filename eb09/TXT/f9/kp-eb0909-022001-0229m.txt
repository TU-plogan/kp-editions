FINLAY, George (1799-1875), the historian of Greece “from its conquest by the Romans to the present time,” was born of Scottish parents at Faversham, Kent, on the 21st of December 1799. His father, Major John Finlay, RE, F.R.S., who had held for some time the post of inspector of the Government powder-mills at Faversham and Waltham Abbey, died when George was still very young (1802); but the boy has left on record how his interest in historical studies was awakened at a very early age by the manner in which his mother used to explain the history of England. On the second marriage of his mother, he was sent to a boarding-school near Liverpool, where he spent three years,—not very profitably, according to his own account. Afterwards his education was continued in more favourable circumstances under a private tutor in the house of his uncle, Mr Kirkman Finlay, who at that time sat as member of parliament for the Glasgow district of burghs. While making good progress in his literary education, he at the same time laid up pleasant and life-long memories of the boating, fishing, and pedestrian excursions for which the picturesque shores of the Firth of Clyde offer so many delightful facilities. At one time he had entertained thoughts of entering the army; but having been dissuaded from this by his friends, he ultimately, at the close of his university curriculum in arts, made choice of the legal profession. He received his preliminary technical training in a writer’s office in Glasgow, and, when little over twenty years of age, went to Göttingen to complete his studies in Roman law. But before this time he had begun to feel a deep interest in the contemporary affairs of Greece, and ct the Hanoverian university he was wholly unable to withdraw[9:9:221] his attention frorii the stirring drama which was then being unfolded in the south-eastern corner of Europe. “I conversed much,” he says, “with everybody I met who had visited Greece, read all the works of modern travellers, and associated a great deal with the only Greek who was then studying at Göttingen.” In 1823 he resolved to visit the country personally, in order that ho might judge for himself of the condition of the people and the prospects of the war. In November accordingly he arrived in Cephalonia, where he first met Lord Byron, by whom, as well as by Sir Charles Napier, the British resident, he was very kindly received. Shortly afterwards he was landed at Pyrgos, and during the next fourteen months, which were spent partly at Athens and partly at Missolonghi, he greatly improved his knowledge of the language, history, and antiquities of the country. While soon led to form a very unfavourable opinion of the rapacity, selfishness, and incompetency of the Greek leaders, both civil and military, he by no means lost his enthusiasm for the cause of Greek independence. A severe att ιck of fever, however, combined with other circumstances to make a change of scene desirable in December 1824. The rest of that winter accordingly and the spring of 1825 were spent in Rome, Naples, and Sicily. After spending a summer at Castle Toward, Argyllshire, he went to Edinburgh, where he attended classes in the university, and passed his examination in civil law with a view to being called to the Scottish bar. His unquenched enthusiasm for Greece, however, made it impossible for him to resist the pressing invitation of his friend Hastings that he should return to that country, and thenceforward, if we except a few brief journeys (one to England in 1826 in order to secure the services of some competent engineers), the remainder of his life was wholly spent in the land of his adoption. He took part in the unsuccessful operations of Lord Cochrane and Sir Richard Church for the relief of Athens in 1827. When independence had been secured in 1829, under the presidency of Capodistrias, he was induced by the prospect of peaceful progress to buy a landed estate in Attica, hoping in this way to aid in putting the country “into the road that leads to a rapid increase of production, population, and material improvement.” These hopes were not realized; all his efforts for the introduction of a better system of agriculture ended in failure; within a very few years he found that he had lost his capital as well as his labour in his generous but ill-rewarded enthusiasm. Only when it had become too plain to him that Greece could be served in no other way, did he form the resolve of giving himself to the literary work which occupied, somewhat sadly, all the remainder of his life. “Had the hopes with which I joined the cause of Greece in 1823 been fulfilled, it is not probable that I should have abandoned the active duties of life, and the noble task of labouring to improve the land, for the sterile task of recording its misfortunes.” So he writes in. 1855. His first publications were The Hellenic Kingdom and the Greek Nation (London, 1836); Essai sur les principes de banque appliquésà l'état actuel de la Grèce (Athens, 1836); and Remarks on the Topography of Oropia and Diacria, with a map (Athens, 1838). The first instalment of his great historical work appeared in 1844 (the 2d edition in 1857) under the title Greece under the Romans: a Historical View of the Condition of the Greek Nation from the time of its Conquest by the Romans until the Extinction of the Roman Empire in the East. Meanwhile he had been qualifying himself still further for his task by travel as well as by reading; he undertook several tours (one in the company of Karl Ritter) to various quarters of the Levant; and as the result of one of them he published a volume On the Site of the Holy Sepulchre; with a plan of Jerusalem (London, 1847). The History of the Byzantine and Greek Empires fromssiXQ-ÌAoZ was completed in 1854. It was speedily followed by the History of Greece under Othoman and Venetian Domination (1856), and by the History of the Greek Revolution (Edinburgh, 1861). In weak health, and conscious of failing energy, he now gave the last years of hi life to the task of revising, supplementing, and partly rewriting his great work. From 1864 to 1870 he was also correspondent of the Times newspaper, and at various periods he contributed articles to Blackwood's Magazine, the Athenaeum, and the Saturday Review. He was a member of several learned societies; and in 1854 he received from the university of Edinburgh the honorary degree of LL.D. He died at Athens on the 26th of January 1875. A new edition of his 11 ist or y , “revised throughout, and in part rewritten, with considerable additions, by the author, and edited by the Rev H. F. Tozer, Μ. A.,” with a portrait by Jeens, was issued from the Oxford Clarendon press in 1877. It includes a brief but extremely interesting fragment of an autobiography of the author. As an historian Finlay had the merit, which was also to some extent the advantage, of entering upon a field of research that had been previously wholly neglected by English writers, Gibbon alone being a partial exception. He brought to his work many admirable qualities; as a student he was laborious, as a scholar he was accurate, as a thinker he was both acute and profound; and in all that he wrote he was unswerving in his loyalty to the principles of constitutional government and to the cause of liberty and justice. The portion of his work which extends from 146 b.c. to 1453 a.d. has been translated into German.
