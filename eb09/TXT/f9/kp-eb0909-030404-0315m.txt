FLETCHER, Giles (1584-1623), English poet of tho 17th century, was born in London about 1584. He was the second son of Dr Giles Fletcher, nephew of Richard Fletcher, bishop of London, cousin of John Fletcher the dramatist, and younger brother of Ishineas Fletcher. He went very young to Cambridge, and as early as 1603 he contributed a poem on the death of Queen Elizabeth to a [9:9:305] volume entitled Sorrow's Joy. He was a bachelor of divinity of Trinity College, and remained at the university until 1617 or later. In 1610 he published his great poem of Christ's Victory and Triumph, of which a second edition appeared in 1632. In 1612 he edited the Remains of his cousin Nathanial Pownoll. It is not known in what year he was ordained, but he became a famous preacher from the pulpit of St Mary’s, and was popular for the florid religious rhetoric then in vogue. He left Cambridge to accept, it is supposed from the hand of Lord Bacon, the rectory of Alderton, on the coast of Suffolk, where “his clownish and low-parted parishioners valued not their pastor according to his worth, which disposed him to melancholy and hastened his dissolution.” In 1623 he published The Reward of the Faithful, a theological treatise in prose, and died in the same year, leaving a widow. The principal work by which Giles Fletcher is known is one of the most remarkable religious poems in the language. Its full title is Christ's Victory and Triumph, in Heaven, in Earth, over and after Death. It is in four cantos, divided according to the suggestion of the title; the metre is an eight-line stanza adapted from the Spenserian by the omission of the seventh line. Giles Fletcher, like his brother Phineas, was a disciple of Spenser, whom he follows with more vigour and brilliance than any poet of his time. His style has much more nervous strength, terseness, and melody than his brother’s, and he had his subject far more thoroughly under control. In his very best passages Giles Fletcher attains to a rare sublimity, and to a rich, voluptuous music which charmed the ear of Milton. It was his misfortune to live in an age which considered the poems of Marini and Gongora insuperable, and he strives too often to outdo these his patterns in grotesque conceit. But when he is carried away by his theme, and forgets to be ingenious, he attains an extraordinary solemnity and harmony of style. His description of the Lady of Vain Delight, in the second canto, has been greatly admired; the portrait of Justice is even nobler still, and of the first order of poetry. Milton did not hesitate to borrow very considerably from the Christs Victory and Triumph in his Paradise Regained. Fletcher died in 1623.

The poetical writings of the Giles Fletchers, father and son, have been edited by Dr A. B. Grosart, who has succeeded in clearing up a great deal of the obscurity that till lately lay around their careers. The Russ Commonwealth has been reprinted and edited by Mr Bond. The prose works of Giles Fletcher the younger have never been reprinted.
