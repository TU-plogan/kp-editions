FITZGERALD, Lord Thomas (d. 1536), was vicedeputy of Ireland for his father, Gerald, ninth earl of Kildare, in ∙ the reign of Henry VIII. He appears to have accompanied his father to London early in 1534, on occasion of the third summons of the earl to answer grave charges of maladministration as lord deputy. But after the earl’s committal to the Tower he was sent back to Ireland to take the place of vice-deputy in his father’s absence, with secret instructions to raise a rebellion against the English Government. He was at this time hardly of age, and his amiable manners and accomplishments had procured for him the appellation of “Silken Thomas.” He was, however, of a high spirit and fiery temper, and fiercely resented the English rule. As soon as he arrived in Ireland, he cleared the way by formally surrendering his office and the sword of state, and then openly proclaimed a rebellion. He obtained possession of Dublin city before the end of July, and formed the siege of the castle, into which the English governor had withdrawn. Archbishop Alleu, the primate who had been appointed by Henry VIII. to keep watch over Kildare and to report his proceedings, sought safety in flight and sailed for England. But the ship was run aground, and the archbishop was seized by the young Lord Thomas and massacred in his presence with his English chaplains and attendants. This murder was reported by a special messenger from Fitzgerald to the pope and the emperor, the former being asked for absolution if necessary, and the latter for assistance. Sentence of excommunication was pronounced on Fitzgerald for this murder of the archbishop. In August Fitzgerald was forced to relinquish the siege of Dublin Castle, and hasten to defend or recover his own domains which the earl of Ormond had invaded. He tried in vain to seduce Ormond from his allegiance, but obtained a truce, of which he took treacherous advantage to attack him. He then again besieged Dublin, which had closed its gates against him. On October 14, in consequence of Ormond’s renewed invasion of Kildare, he was compelled to raise the siege. Three days later the English army landed at Dublin, and was enthusiastically welcomed. Fitzgerald withdrew into the country; but taking advantage of the inactivity of Skeffington, the new deputy, he approached Dublin again and burnt two villages near the city (November). The old earl had been attainted, and he died in the Tower soon after hearing of his son’s rebellion and excommunication. The deathblow to the rebellion was at length given by Skeffington, who in March 1535 stormed the castle of Maynooth, the chief stronghold of the “Geraldines.” Lord Thomas, who had now succeeded his father, but did not assume the title, retreated into Thomond, intending to sail for Spain and plead with the emperor. This scheme he relinquished, and after leading a wandering life for some months, with a price set upon his head, he surrendered without definite conditions to Lord Leonard Grey (August), and was at once conducted by him to England. He was committed to the Tower with his five uncles; and the six Geraldines w ere hung at Tyburn as traitors (February 3, 1536). An act of attainder was passed against the earl of Kildare, Lord Thomas, and others, in 1537; but the family estates were restored by Edward VI., and tho attainder was repealed by Queen Elizabeth. Moore has pointed out, in his Life and Death of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, some remarkable points of resemblance between his story and that of his ancestor, Lord Thomas.
