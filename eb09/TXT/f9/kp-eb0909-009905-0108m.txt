FERNANDEZ, Joam, a Portuguese traveller, also of the 15th century. Early in life he had been taken captive by pirates of Barbary. While amongst them he acquired a knowledge of Arabic, and had his curiosity stimulated with regard to the geography of the African continent. On regaining his freedom he joined an exploring expedition, and got himself landed at the mouth'pf the Ouro river (lat 23°N.), where, exposed to considerable hardship and danger, he spent seven months of a nomadic life with some of the native tribes, and acquired a considerable amount of information about the geography of the interior (1445). Two years afterwards he explored the territory in the neighbourhood of Cape Blanco. He deserves some notice as having been the earliest of modern African explorers. The narrative of his adventures, which is said by those who have seen it to resemble that of Mungo Park, is to be found in Azurara’s Conquista de Guine.
