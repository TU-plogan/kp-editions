FOTHERGILL, John (1712-1780), F.RS., an eminent physician, a member of the Society of Friends, was born at Carr End in Yorkshire. He took the degree of Îœ. I). at Edinburgh in 1736. After visiting the Continent, he in 1740 settled in London, and gained there an extensive practice. In the epidemics of influenza in 1775 and 1776 he is said to have had sixty patients daily. In his leisure he made a study of conchology and botany; and after his death, which took place in December 1780, his collections of shells, prints, and other objects were sold for a considerable sum. Fothergill was a licentiate of the College of Physicians of London, and a fellow of that of Edinburgh, of which he was a great benefactor. He was the patron of Sidney Parkinson, the South Sea voyager. A translation of the Bible (1764 sqs) by Anthony Purver, a Quaker, was made and printed at his expense. His pamphlet entitled Account of the Sore Throat attended with Ulcers (1748, 2d ed. 1754), prepared with the assistance of information supplied by Dr Letherland, attracted great attention, and was translated into several languages. His works were edited by Dr John Elliot (1781), by Gilbert Thomson (1782). and by Dr Lettsom (1783).
