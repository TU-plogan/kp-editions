FASTI, plural of the adjective fastus, but more commonly used as a substantive, is derived, according to Varro, from fas, meaning what is binding, or allowable, by divine law, as opposed to jus, or human law. Fasti dies thus came to mean the days on which law business might be transacted (see Ovid, Fasti, i. 48) sine piaculo, thus corresponding to our own “lawful days.” Originally the fasti were a kind of official year-book, or almanac, with dates and directions for religious ceremonies, court-days, market-days, divisions of the month, and the like. Festus Pompeius calls them totius anni descriptio. In later times they meant state records in general. The fasti, again, were of two distinct kinds— kalendaria, or fasti kalendares, subdivided into urbαni and mιstici, and next, fasti magistrales, or historici. Until 314 b.c. the lore of the kalendariα remained the exclusive and lucrative monopoly of the priesthood; but in that year Cn. Flavius, a pontifical secretary, introduced the custom of publishing in the forum tables containing the requisite information, besides brief references to victories, triumphs, prodigies, &c. These tables were also called fasti. Ovid’s Fasti have been well described as “a poetical year-book” illustrating the fasti published by Julius Caesar when he remodelled the Roman year. In the tables of Flavius, the letters F., N., N.P., F.P., Q. Rex C.F., C., EN., stood for fastus, nefastus, nefastus priore (in the first half of the day), fastus priore, quando rex sacrorum comitiavit fastus, comitialis, and intercisus. The dies intercisi were partly fasti and partly nefasti. Upon the cultivators fewer feasts, sacrifices, ceremonies, and holidays were enjoined than on the inhabitants of cities; and the rustic fasti contained little more than the ceremonies of the kalends, nones, and ides, the fairs, signs of zodiac, increase and decrease of the days, the tutelary gods of each month, and certain directions for rustic labours to be performed each month. The fasti magistrales were concerned with the several feasts, and everything relating to the gods, religion, and the magistrates; to the emperors, their birthdays, offices, days consecrated to them, with feasts and ceremonies established in their honour, or for their prosperity. They came to be denominated rnagni, by way of distinction from the bare kalendar, or fasti kalendares. Of this class, the fasti consulares, for example, were a chronicle or register of time, in which the several years were denoted by the respective consuls, with the principal events which happened during their consulates. A famous specimen of the same class are the fasti Capitolini, so called because they were deposited in the Capitol by Alexander Farnese, after their excavation from the Roman forum in 1547. They are chiefly a nominal hst of statesmen, victories, triumphs, &c., from the expulsion of the kings to the death of Augustus. A considerable number of fasti of the first class have also been discovered; but none of them appear to be older than the time of Augustus. The Praenestine calendar, discovered in 1770, contains the [9:9:44] months of January, March, April, and December, and a portion of February. The tablets give an account of festivals, as also of the triumphs of Augustus and Tiberius. But some kinds of fasti included under the second general head were, from the very beginning, written for publication. The Annales Pontificum — different from the kaleudaria properly so called—were “annually exhibited in public on a white table, on which the memorable events of the year, with special mention of the prodigies, were set down in the briefest possible manner. Any one was allowed to copy them” (Teuffel’s History). Like the pontifices, the augurs also had their books, libri augurales. In fact, all the state offices had their fasti corresponding in character to the consular fasti named above.

For details of fasti anil their discovery, see the great work of Foggini, published at Rome in 1779. Watt’s Bibliotheca Britannica contains a long list of references to authorities on the subject. See also Cruttwell·s History of Roman Literature, 1877. An admirable summary on fasti, with numerous bibliographical references, is given in Teuffel’s Geschichte des Römischen Literatur, 1870,—translated by Wagner under the title of A History of Roman Literature, 1873.
