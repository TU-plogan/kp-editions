FLUTE, a wind instrument which in a variety of forms has been in constant use from the earliest ages, To Olympus the Phrygian has been ascribed the introduction of flute-playing into Greece, an art which was much encouraged in the later days of the empire. The Greeks employed professional flute-players in many of their religious ceremonies, and competitive trials of skill were frequent. The old English flute, called ↑hQ flute-à-bec, from the supposed resemblance of the mouthpiece to the beak of a bird, was played from the upper and wider end, had seven finger holes, and was made of various sizes, called treble, alto, tenor, and bass flutes respectively. This instrument continued in common use to about the middle of the 18th century, when it was gradually superseded by the modern horizontal {flauto traversa) or “German” flute. Handel was one of the first to introduce the new instrument into the orchestra, employing it for solos in The Ode on Saint Cecilia's Day (1739), notably in the air “The soft complaining Flute.” But the capacities of the traverso of Handel’s time were very limited in comparison with those of its modern representative, which possesses a workable compass of about three octaves from the low C in the treble clef, with all the chromatic intervals. Various systems of fingering have been introduced from time to time by the most eminent flautists and flute-makers, and concertos for the flute as a solo instrument have been composed with a view to exhibiting the powers of celebrated performers. In orchestral scores the flute part is generally placed at the top, and is written in the violin or G clef. The piccolo or octave flute, the E flat or tierce, the D flat or minor ninth (transposing piccolo), the flute d’amour, a minor third below the ordinary instrument—are all varieties of the traversa, which like the fife is blown by an oval shaped hole in the side, near the stopped end of the tube Other branches, now obsolete, of the flute family were—the recorder, varying in length of tube from about twelve [9:9:351] inches to three feet, the largest being known as the bass recorder; the comet, shaped like a quadrant, and gradually tapering towards the mouthpiece; and the pilgrim's staff, having a tube about six feet in length. For other less important varieties the reader is referred to Musurgia, Luscinius, 1536; Harmonie Universelle, Mersenne, 1636. Among the foundation stops of most organs will generally be found one or more “flute” stops, e.g., the hold fiöte, of eight feet tone, and the octavo flute, of four feet tone. The flageolet is a smaller variety of the old fiute-à-bec, and was formerly used in the orchestra. Handel has written an obbligato part for it in the well-known barytone air “O, ruddier than the cherry.” The fife, much used in military bands, is simply an octave flute in D, played horizontally, and having six finger holes and one key.
