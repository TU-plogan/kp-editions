FÜNFKIRCHEN, Hung. Pécs, a royal free city of Hungary, capital of the vármegye or county of Baranya, is situated on the declivity of Mount Mecsek, and on the railway to Mohács, 105 miles S.S.W. of Buda, 46° 6' N. lat., 18° 13' E. long. It is one of the oldest and finest towns in Hungary, and is the seat of a bishop and of the county administration. It consists principally of a public square, and a main street extending about five miles in length. Amongst the noteworthy buildings are the cathedral, said to have been founded by St Stephen of Hungary in 1009, and reputed to be the oldest church in the kingdom, the bishop’s palace, the county and town halls, several churches and monasteries, a public hospital, the theatre, an ecclesiastical seminary, a high-class gymnasium, and other educational establishments. Fünfkirchen has manufactories of woollen-cloth, flannels, rosoglio, oil, leather, and paper, and also carries on a considerable trade in tobacco, gall-nuts, and wine. The population in 1870 amounted to 23,863, chiefly Catholics: by nationality the greater number are Magyars, the remainder Germans and Croatians. In former times Fünfkirchen was of much greater relative importance than at present. According to tradition it existed in the time of the Romans. In the Frankish-German period it was known under the name of Quinque Ecclesiae; its bishopric was founded in 1009; in 1543 it was taken by the Turks, who retained possession of it till 1686. On the 18th June 1849 it was occupied by the Austrians under General Nugent. ’
