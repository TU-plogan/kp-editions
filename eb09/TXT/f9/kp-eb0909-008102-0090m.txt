FERDINAND IV. (1285-1312), sometimes called el EmœÅlazado, i.e., Cited or Summoned, succeeded his father Sancho IV. on the throne of Castile and Leon in 1295. The years of his minority were disturbed by a series of civil wars caused by the pretensions of his cousins Don Juan and Don Alonso de la Cerda to the crown, by the disputes of the Haros, Laras, and other nobles about their privileges, by the restlessness of the municipalities, and by the ambition of the neighbouring kings of Portugal, Aragon, and Granada. The queen-mother, Maria de

Molina, on each new outbreak succeeded in procuring peace by diplomatic tact and judicious compromise. Secure at last in possession of his throne, Ferdinand wa3 free to pursue the traditional policy of war against the Moors; and in carrying it out he was aided by pecuniary grants both from his own nobles and also from the pope (Clement V.), as well as by the spoils of the Templars on the extinction of that order in 1310. His chief exploit, as recorded by the historians, both Spanish and Arab, was the expedition against Algeciras (1309), which, while unsuccessful in its main object, resulted in the surrender of Gibraltar and the cession of other strongholds (Gayangos, ii. 348; Conde, IV. xiv). In the course of a subsequent campaign he died suddenly at Jaen, September 7,1312. According to Mariana, he had on the 8th of August preceding condemned to death without lawful trial two brothers of the name of Carvajal. These protesting their innocence had summoned him to meet them within thirty days at the bar of God; hence his surname. He was succeeded by his infant son Alphonso XI. (See Mariana, XV. i.-xi.)
