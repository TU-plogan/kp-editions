FISCHART (1546-1590), Johannes, the great German satirist of the 16th century, was born probably at Strasburg (according to some accounts at Mainz), in 1546, and was educated at Worms, in the house of Kaspar Scheid, whom he mentions in the preface to his Eulenspiegel as his “cousin and preceptor.” After taking the degree of Doctor der Rechte at Basel in 1570, he left Germany for a time, and is said to have travelled in Italy, the Netherlands, France, and England. Having returned to Strasburg, he lived there from 1576 to about 1580 with his brother-in-law the printer, Bernhard Jobin, who became the publisher of most of Fischart’s works. In 1581 Fischart became Advocat am Reichskammergericht at Spire, and in 1583 Hohenfelsischer Amtmann at Forbach, near Saarbrück. Here he died in the winter of 1589-90, at the age of forty-three. Fischart wrote under various feigned names, such as Mentzer, Menzer, Reznem, Huldrich Elloposkleros, Jesuwalt-Pickhart, Winhold Alkofribas Wüstblutus, and Huldrich Mansehr von Treubach; and it is partly owing to this fact that there is doubt whether some of the works attributed to him are really his. More than 50 satirical works, however, both in prose and verse, remain authentic, among which are— Der Nachtrabe, or Die Nebelkräh (1570), a satire against one Jacob Rabe, who had become a convert to the Catholic Church; Von St Dominici des Prediger-mönchs u. St Francisco Barfüssers artlichem Leben (1571), a poem with the expressive motto “Sie haben Nasen vnd riechens nit,” written to defend the Protestants against certain wicked accusations, one of which was that Luther held communion with the devil; Eulenspeigel Reimensweis (1572); Allerpraktik Grossmutter (1572), after Rabelais’s Prognostication Pantagrueline; Flöhatz Weibertratz (1574); Afferdeuerliche und ungeheuerliche Geschichtschrift vom Leben, Rhaten und Thaten, u. s. w., von Gargantoa u. Pantagruel, also after Rabelais (1575, and again under a modified title 1577); Neue künstliche Figuren Biblischer Historien (1576); Anmahnung zur christlichen Kinderzucht (1576); Das glück-hafft Schiff von Zürich (1576, repub. 1828 and 1849), a poem commemorating the adventure of a company of Zurich arquebusiers, who sailed from their native town to Strasburg in one day, and brought, as a proof of this feat, a kettleful of “Hirsebrei,” which had been cooked in Zurich, still warm into Strasburg; Podagrammisch Trostbüchlein (1577); Das philosophisch Ehzuchtbüchlein (1578); the celebrated Bienenkorb des heiligen römischen Immenschwarms, &c., a modification of the Dutch Bynencorf der roomischer kerke, by Philipp Marnix of St Aldegonde, published in 1579 and again in 1847; Der heilig Brotkorb, (1580), after Calvin’s Traité des Reliques·, Das vierhörnige Jesuiterhütlein, a rhymed satire against the Jesuits (1580); Catalogus Catalogorum perpetuo durabilis (1589). To Fischart also have been attributed some “Psalmen und geistliche Lieder” which appeared in a Strasburg hymn book of 1576. Fischart had studied not only the ancient literatures, but also those of Italy, France, the Netherlands, and England. He was a lawyer, a theologian, a satirist, in religion a staunch Protestant, in politics a republican. Above all, he is reputed a master of language, and was indefatigable with his pen. His satire was levelled mercilessly at all perversities in the public and private life of his time,—at astrological superstition, scholastic pedantry, ancestral pride, but especially at the papal dignity and the lives of the priesthood and the Jesuits. He indulged in the wildest witticisms, the most abandoned caricature; but all this he did with a serious purpose. Thirty years after Fischart’s death his writings, once so popular, were almost entirely forgotten. Recalled to the public attention by Bodmer and Lessing, it is only quite recently that his works have come to be a subject of investigation, and his position in German literature to be fully understood. There is a collection of Fischart’s works in the royal library at Berlin.
