FREUDENSTADT, a town of Würtemberg, circle of the Black Forest, on the right bank of the Murg, 42 miles W.S.W. of Stuttgart. It has a large square, a townhouse, and a Protestant church of later Gothic architecture, with two naves at right angles to each other, in one of which the male and in the other the female members of the congregation worship separately. The manufactures include woollen cloth, nails, white lead, potash, and Prussian [9:9:777] blue; and there is some trade in corn, cattle, and wood. Freudenstadt was founded in 1599 by Protestant refugees from Austria, and at first it received from Duke Frederick tlιe name of Frederickstadt, which on account of the peaceful prosperity of the town was afterwards changed to Freudenstadt. The population in 1875 was 5325.
