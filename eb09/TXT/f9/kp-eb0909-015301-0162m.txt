FIFTH MONARCHY MEN, a Puritan sect who supported Cromwell’s government in the expectation that it was a preparation for the “fifth monarchy,”—that is, the monarchy which should succeed the Assyrian, the Persian, the Grecian, and the Roman, and during which Christ should reign with his saints on earth for a thousand years. Being disappointed at the delay in the fulfilment of their hope≡, they attempted to foment a political agitation against the government of Cromwell, but the arrest of Feake and Powell, two of the most violent of their number, was sufficient for a time to damp their ardour, and they were content to nourish their dreams in secret until after the Restoration, when, on January 6, 1661, fifty of them, headed by a wine-cooper named Venner, made a mad effort to attain possession of London in name of “King Jesus.” Most of the fifty were either killed or taken prisoners, and on January 19 and 21 Venner and ten others were executed for high treason. From that time the special doctrines of the sect either died completely out, or became merged in a milder form of millenarianism similar to that which still exists at the present day.
