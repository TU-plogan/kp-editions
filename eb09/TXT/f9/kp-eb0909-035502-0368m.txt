FOLDVÁR, or Düna Földvár (Danube Földvár), a town of Hungary in the county of Tolna, on the right bank of the Danube, 48 miles south of Buda, 46° 48' N. lat., 18° 45' E. long., is situated partly on the crest and partly on the side of a hill. Among the principal buildings are a circuit judge’s court, customs office, barracks, four churches, a Franciscan monastery, and a high school. Földvár, on account of its position, is an important steampacket station, and carries on a considerable trade in wood for building purposes by means of the Danube; it is moreover a depot for salt, and has an extensive sturgeon fishery. The surrounding country is fertile both in corn and wine, and the inhabitants are much engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits, fruit-growing, the manufacture of pottery, and fishing. The town, which is a domain of the university of Pesth, had formerly strong fortifications, of which some remains still exist. In the revolution of 1848-49 Földvár was considered an important strategical position, on account of its commanding the communications between the upper and lower Danube. In 1869 the population was 12,382.
