FOÜCHER, Simon (1644-1696), a sceptical writer during the latter part of the 17th century, was born at Dijon on the 1st March 1644. Extremely little is known of his life. He was the son of a merchant at Dijon, and appears to have taken orders at a very early age. For some years he held the position of honorary canon at Dijon, but this he resigned in order to take up residence in Paris. He graduated at the Sorbonne, and spent the remainder of his life in literary work in Paris. Foucher’s name is now almost completely forgotten, but in his day he enjoyed considerable repute as a keen opponent of Malebranche. His point of view in philosophy may be called the sceptical, but the scepticism extends to only one doctrine, external perception. On this point he revived the old arguments of the Academy, and advanced them with much ingenuity against Malebranche’s doctrine. Otherwise his scepticism is subordinate to orthodox belief, the fundamental dogmas of the church seeming to him intuitively evident. His writings against Malebranche were collected under the title Dissertations sur la Recherche de la Vérité, 1693. See Rabbe, L'Abbe Simon Foucher, Dijon, 1867.
