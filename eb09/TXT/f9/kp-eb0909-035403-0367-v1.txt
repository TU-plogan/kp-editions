FOIX, Paul de (1528-1584), a French prelate and diplomatist, was born in 1528. He studied Greek and Roman literature at Paris, and jurisprudence at Toulouse, where shortly after finishing his curriculum, he delivered a course of lectures on civil law, which gained him great reputation. At the age of nineteen he was named councillor of the parlement of Paris. Having in this capacity expressed himself favourable to the adoption of mild measures in regard to certain persons accused of Lutheranism, he was arrested, but escaped punishment, and subsequently regained the favour of the French court. At the end of 1561 he was sent ambassador to England, where he remained four years, and in 1565 endeavoured in vain to persuade Elizabeth to consent to the surrender of Havre to the French. He was afterwards sent to negotiate a marriage between Elizabeth and the duke of Anjou. On account of his former toleration of the Lutherans, Foix only with difficulty escaped perishing in the Massacre of St Bartholomew in 1572; but having been sent in 1573 on an embassy to Italy, he was admitted to an audience of the pope, and succeeded in thoroughly establishing his reputation for orthodoxy. In 1576 he was made archbishop of Toulouse. He was afterwards employed by the king of France on various important missions, and in 1579 was appointed ambassador to Rome, where he remained till his death in 1584.

Les Lettres de Messire de Paul de Foix, archcυcsque de Toloze et ambassadeur pour le roy auprès du pape Grégoire XIII., au roi Henry III., were published in 1628, but there are some doubts as to their authenticity.
