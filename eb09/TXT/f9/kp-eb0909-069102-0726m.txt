+====================================================================+


FRANCIS I. (1708-1765), head of the Holy Roman Empire, the eldest son of Leopold, duke of Lorraine, was born on the 8th of December 1708. His full name was Francis Stephen. At the age of fifteen he ∙was sent to Vienna, where he received the Silesian duchy of Teschen. In 1735, in return for Lorraine, which Charles VI., at the end of the war of the Polish succession, gave to Stanislaus Leszczynsk’, Francis Stephen obtained the reversion to the duchy of Tuscany, to which he succeeded in 1737. The year before the latter date he married Maria Theresa, the daughter of the emperor Charles VI., and after the emperor’s death in 1740 he was declared by his wife joint regent of her dominions. He was elected emperor after the death of Charles .VII., and crowned at Frankfort on the 4th of October 1745. He carried on extensive trading operations, and was an enthusiastic collector of works of art; but he had no energy of character, and was quite willing that the empress-queen, Maria Theresa, should do all the real work of government. When Austria and France, laying aside the animosities of two centuries, were coming to an understanding before the Seven Years’ War, he was shrewd enough to see the difficulties which would inevitably arise from such an alliance. Maria Theresa, however, although she sincerely loved him, had no respect for the political judgment of her ∙ good-natured husband, and he quietly acquiesced in her will. He suddenly died at Innsbruck on the 18th of August 1765, falling into the arms of his second son Leopold, who succeeded him as duke of Tuscany, and ultimately (after the death of Joseph II.) became emperor.
