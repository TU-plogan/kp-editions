FOLIGNO, or Fuligno (ancient Fulgiìiium), a town in the Italian province of Perugia, is situated in a beautiful and fertile valley on the Topino, 20 miles S.E. of Perugia by railway. It is an active and industrious town, its manufactures being chiefly woollen fabrics, silk, paper, wax-candles, and soap. Its principal buildings are the cathedral, the Palazzo del Governo, the Palazzo Comunale, the theatre, and the churches of S. Anna and S. Niccolò, both of which contain some fine paintings. Foligno was the seat of a school of painting, the most distinguished master of which is Niccolò Alunno, to whom a monument was erected there in 1872. Foligno is the Umbrian Fulginium, and afterwards became a Roman municipality. In the Middle Ages it was known as Fulignum, and for a long time retained its independence, but in 1281 it was destroyed by the Perugians. After it was rebuilt it was ruled by the Trinci family until 1439, when it was united to the States of the Church. In 1832 it was much damaged by an earthquake, and it suffered from the same cause, but less severely, in 1839, 1853, and 1854. The population in 1871 was 8471.
