FAUJAS DE SAINT-FOND, Barthélemi (1741- 1819), French geologist and traveller, was bornât Montélimart, May 17, 1741. He was educated at the Jesuits’ College at Lyons; and, showing in his boyhood much poetic sensibility and a propensity to versifying, he received from some of his worldly-wise elders the earnest warning,—If you would succeed, don’t make verses. He appears to have submitted to this counsel; for he went to Grenoble and applied himself to the study of law, and was admitted advocate to the parliament. He rose to be president of the seneschal’s court (1765), a post which he honourably filled, but the duties of which became before long intolerably irksome, for his feeling for nature was not extinguished, and his favourite relaxation was found in visits to the Alps. His final bent, however, was not to the poetic but to the scientific interpretation of nature. In his frequent Alpine rambles he was amassing observations and facts, the full value of which could only be known at a later time. Geology was in its infancy, had scarcely even a name, when Faujas began his studies of the forms, structure, composition, and superposition of rocks, nor was it possible for him to divine how vast the science that was to arise upon the foundation of the facts of which he was so keen and so diligent an observer. In 1776 he put himself in communication with Buffon, who was not slow to perceive that the humble labours of Faujas would be of great service to him [9:9:53] in liis larger and more imaginative sphere of work. Invited by Buffon to Paris, he quitted the law, and was appointed by Louis XVI. assistant naturalist to the museum, to which office was added some years later (1785, 1788) that of royal commissioner for mines. In 1775 he had discovered in the Velay a rich mine of pozzuolana, which he opened, and which was largely worked by the Government. One of the most important of his works was the Recherches sur les volcans eteints du Vivarais et du Velay, which appeared in 1778. In this work, rich in facts and observations, he developed his theory of the origin of volcanoes. In his capacity of commissioner for mines Faujas travelled in almost all the countries of Europe, everywhere devoting his chief attention to the surface of the globe, and the nature and constituents of the rocks composing it. It was he who first called attention to the basaltic formation of the cave of Fingal (Staffa). He sustained heavy losses during the early years of the Revolution, but for these ho was in 1797 indemnified by a grant made by the council of five hundred. Having been nominated in 1793 professor at the Jardin des Plantes, he held this post till he was nearly eighty years of age, retiring in 1818 to his estate in Dauphin^. Faujas took a warm interest in the balloon experiments of the brothers Montgolfier, and published a very complete Description des experiences de la machine aerostatique de MM. Montgolfier, &c. (1783,1784). He contributed many scientific memoirs to the Annales and the Memoir es of the museum of natural history. Among his separate works, in addition to those already named are— Histoire naturelie de la province du Dauphine (1781, 1782); Mineralogie des Volcans (1784); Voyage en Angleterre, en Ecosse, et aux Iles Hebrides (1797); and Essai de geologic (1803-1809). Faujas died at his estate of Saint-Fond in Dauphin^, July 18, 1819.
