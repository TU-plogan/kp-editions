FLUOR SPAR, Fluorite, or Calcium Fluoride, CaF 2 , (Germ. Fluss-spatlι), the “blue John” of Derbyshire, and “cann” or “kann” of Cornish miners, occurs crystallized in [9:9:350] simple or modified cubes and octahedrons; also nodular, compact and granular, and more rarely fibrous, or soft and earthy. Some octahedral crystals from the mines of St Agnes, in Cornwall, are made up of minute cubes, which may themselves show faces of other forms of the monometric system of crystallography. Fluor spar is a brittle, transparent to sub-translucent mineral, with a perfect octahedral cleavage, a vitreous, sometimes splendent lustre, a hardness of 4, and a specific gravity of 3Ol-3 ’ 25. Before the blowpipe it decrepitates, tinges the flame dull red, and fuses into an enamel. Heated with concentrated sulphuric acid it yields hydrofluoric acid (see Chemistry, vol. v. p. 491). In colour fluor spar varies much, being blue, purple, green, yellow, pink, or brown; it is sometimes dichroic. The colours are attributed by Wyrouboff to the presence of minute quantities of hydrocarbons, taken up from solutions from which the mineral has crystallized; by others they are considered to be due to peculiarities of molecular structure. In the Weardale fluors small cavities containing liquid have occasionally been found. Fluor spar, in common with some other substances, when exposed to light, or when raised to a temperature somewhat under redness, usually phosphoresces, emitting a bright light, the colour of which is not dependent on that of the mineral. A variety of fluor spar has received its name chlorophane from its fine green phosphorescence. Like the colour, the phosphorescence of fluor-spar is destroyed by exposure to a high temperature; it may be partly restored by means of an electric discharge, or, it is said, by moistening with dilute hydrofluoric acid. From the name of the mineral Professor Stokes borrowed the term ‘' fluorescence,” applied by him to the quality which certain bodies, e.g., sulphate of quinine, possess of rendering the ultra-violet rays of the spectrum visible. W. Hankel {Ann. Phys. Chem. [2], ii. 66-83), experimenting on crystals of fluor spar from Weardale, found that when exposed to light they exhibited not only phosphorescence but electrical phenomena; the rays of the sun, however, concentrated by a lens, deprived the crystals of their photoelectrical property, which they did not regain. Fluor spar is slightly soluble in water containing hydrated calcium carbonate. Pseudomorphs of hornstone, hematite, calamine, and other minerals after fluor spar are not unfrequent. Fluor spar is commonly used for the production of hydrofluoric acid in etching on seals and glass, and in the smelting of lead and copper and in other metallurgical operations as a flux, whence its name, from the Latin fiuo, to flow. The manufacture of vases and other ornamental articles from fluor spar, especially the variegated varieties, has long been carried on in Derbyshire. The stone, which is sometimes first heated to change its blue to an amethystine tint, is shaped by means of the lathe and a fine steel tool, and is finished off with coarse stone, and after that with pumice and emery. Fluor spar is of frequent occurrence in metalliferous veins, being most commonly associated with ores of lead, as in the mines of Derbyshire, Cumberland, Cornwall, Saxony, and Bohemia. It is met with also in granite, gneiss, slates, various limestones and sandstones, and some volcanic products, and has occasionally been detected in beds of coal.

On the phosphorescence of fluor spar see Prof. C. Bohn’s paper on “Negative Fluorescence and Phosphorescence,” Phil. Mag. [4J, vol. xxxiv. p. 109, 1867.
