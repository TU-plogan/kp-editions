FOLKES, Martin (1690-1754), an eminent English antiquary, was born at London, October 29, 1690. At the age of seventeen he entered at Clare College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself so much in mathematics that when only twenty-three years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. He was elected one of the council in 1716, and in 1723 Sir Isaac Newton, president of the society, appointed him one of the vice-presidents. On the death of Newton he became a candidate for the presidency, but the higher standing and superior influence of the other candidate, Sir Hans Sloane, carried the election against him. In 1733 he set out on a tour through Italy, in the course of which he found opportunity of consulting the best furnished cabinets of that country, and composed his admirable “Dissertations on the Weights and Values of Ancient Coins,” which he read before the Society of Antiquaries. Before the same society he read in 1736 his “Observations on the Trajan and Antonine Pillars at Rome,” and also communicated his “Table of English Gold Coins from the 18th year of King Edward III., when gold was first coined in England, to the present time, with their Weights and Intrinsic Values.” In 1745 he printed this work along with another on the history of silver coinage. He also contributed both to the Society of Antiquaries and to the Royal Society various other papers, chiefly on Roman antiquities, wshich were published in their transactions. In 1741 he succeeded Sir Hans Sloane as president of the Royal Society; in the following year he was made a member of the French Academy; and in 1746 was honoured with the degree of LL.I). from Cambridge and Oxford. He died in 1754.
