FORD, Richard (1796-1858), author of one of the earliest and best of travellers’ Handbooks, was the eldest son of Sir Richard Ford, who in 1789 was member of parliament for East Grinstead, and for many years afterwards chief police magistrate of London. His mother was the daughter and heiress of Benjamin Booth, who was a distinguished connoisseur in art, and from whom his grandson seemed to have inherited the artistic skill and taste which he developed to so high a pitch of excellence in his writings, his sketches, and his collections from Continental countries, particularly Spain. He was educated at Winchester, graduated at Trinity College, Oxford, and was called to the bar in Lincoln’s Inn. Ford, however, never practised the profession of a lawyer, and in 1830 he landed for the first time in Spain, where he travelled for three years, spending much of his time in the Alhambra, and at Seville. On his return to England in 1833, he settled in Devonshire at Heavitree, near Exeter, where, writes his friend, the late Sir William Stirling Maxwell, “he built himself a charming residence, and surrounded it with gardens and terraces, which he adorned with graceful Moorish buildings, and planted with pines and cypresses from historic groves by the Xenil and Guadalquiver.” From 1837 to 1857 he contributed to the Quarterly Review, his first contribution to that periodical being a paper on the apparently uninviting subject of Devonshire cob walls, and his last a review of Tom Brown’s School Days. His first work was the pamphlet, An Historical Inquiry into the Unchangeable Character of a War in Spain (Murray, 1837), in reply to one called the Policy of England towards Spain, and issued under the patronage of Lord Palmerston. He spent the winter of 1839-40 in Italy, where he added largely to his collection of majolica; and soon after his return he began, at Mr Murray’s invitation, to write his Handbook for Travellers in Spain, the literary work with which his name is chiefly associated. In consequence of the failure of his health, he was obliged to resign his seat on a royal commission that had been appointed, in the winter of 1856-7, to report on the best site for the National Gallery, and he died on the 31 st August 1858.
