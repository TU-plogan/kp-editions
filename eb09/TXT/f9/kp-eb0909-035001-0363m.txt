FLUSHING (Dutch Vlissingen), a fortified seaport town of the province of Zealand, Holland, is situated on the island of Walcheren, at the mouth of the estuary of the Western Scheldt, about 4 miles S. of Middleburg, and 60 miles S.W. of Rotterdam. It possesses an academy of sciences, a school of navigation, a town-hall, a theatre, an exchange, and a statue to Admiral Ruyter, who was born here in 1607. Since 1872 it has had direct railway connexion with the main lines of Europe; and by the construction in 1873 of a great harbour, docks, and canal works a communication between it and the North Sea has been opened up for vessels of the largest size. The outer harbour has a surface of 33'11 acres, and a depth at low water of 22 feet; the depth of both the inner harbours at low water is 27 feet, the surface of the one being 16'55 acres and that of the other 11 ’ 86 acres. With these works Flushing possesses one of the finest and safest harbours of thè Continent, and the one on the Dutch coast best adapted for the trade of Holland and Germany. Its chief exports are wheat, beans, fish (especially shrimps), and cattle; and its chief imports coal from England, and. coffee, tea, and tin from Java. The number of vessels entering and clearing annually is upwards of 100. Besides the shipping trade the chief industries are brewing and the manufacture of oil and soap. Flushing was one of the “cautionary towns” delivered up to Queen Elizabeth in 1585 in security for the money and soldiers sent by her to assist the Dutch under Sir Philip Sidney. It was captured by the French in 1795, and in 1809 it was bombarded by the English under Lord Chatham, and did not surrender till the fine town-hall, two churches, and about 100 houses were destroyed. Its fortifications have since that time been greatly strengthened, and now completely command the entrance to the river. Population in 1869, 8929.
