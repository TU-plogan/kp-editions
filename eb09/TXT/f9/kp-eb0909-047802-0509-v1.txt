FOUGÈRES, a town of France, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, situated for the most part on an eminence near the left bank of the Nançon, a tributary of the Couesnon, by which the lower town is not unfrequently laid under water. It was formerly one of the strongest places on the frontier towards Normandy, and it still preserves some portions of its 15th-century walls. The castle is now a picturesque ruin, with abundant evidence in its noble towers and outworks at once of its strength and its magnificence. The finest of all the towers was erected in 1242 by Hugues of Lusignan, and named after Melusine the mythical foundress of the family. The churches of St Léonard and St Sulpice both date, at least in part, from the 15th century; and the town-hall has a gate of the 16th and a belfry tower of the 15th. Among the other public buildings are a hospital founded in 1688, a civil and military prison, an institution for deaf-mutes, an orphanage, and a normal school The trade and manufactures of the town are considerable—the former consisting mainly of agricultural and dairy produce, and the latter of shoes and boots, sail-cloth and other hempen fabrics, flannel, hats, and leather. Fougères frequently figures in history from the 11th to the 15th century. It w as taken by the English in 1202, and again iu 1448; and the name of Surienne, the captor on the second occasion, is still borne by one of the towers of the castle. Population in 1851, 8771; in 1876, 10,396.
