FOURCHAMBAULT, a town of France in the department of Nièvre, on the right bank of the Loire, with a station on the railway about 5 miles S.E. of Nevers. It owes its importance to its extensive iron-works, which were established in 1821 by MM. Boignes, and give employment to from 2000 to 5000 workmen. Among the more remarkable chefs d ’ oeuvre which have been produced at Fourchambault are the metal portions of the Pont du Carrousal, some of the bronzes of the Colonne du Juillet, the framework of the cathedral at Chartres, and the vast spans of the bridge over the Dordogne at Cubzac. The population of the town in 1871 was 5835, and of the commune 6054.
