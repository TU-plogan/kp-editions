FURETIÈRE, Antoine, best known as the author of a Dictionnaire Universel de la Langue Française, was born at Paris in 1620, and died 14th May 1688. He first studied law, and practised for a time as an advocate, but finally entered the church and became abbé of Chalivoy. In his leisure moments he devoted himself to letters, and in virtue of his satires— Nouvelle Allégorique ou Histoire des derniers troubles arrivés au royaume J éloquence, 1658; Voyage de Mercure, 1659, &c.—he was admitted a member of the French Academy in 1662. That learned body had long promised to the world a complete dictionary of the French tongue; and when they heard that Furetière was on the point of issuing a work of a similar nature, they interfered, alleging that he had purloined from their stores, and that they possessed the exclusive privilege of publishing such a book. After much bitter recrimination on.both sides the offender was expelled in 1685; but for this act of injustice he took a severe revenge in his satire Couches de V Académie. The reply which he made to the Academician Charpentier, entitled Factums, ran through four editions. His dictionary was published at Rotterdam two years after his death. It was afterwards revised and improved by Basnage, who published his edition in 1701 and again in 1725; and it continued to enjoy a high reputation till the appearance of the Dictionnaire de Trévoux, for which indeed it furnished the basis. Furetière’s other works do not possess any great literary merit; but one of them, Le Roman Bourgeois, is of interest as descriptive of [9:9:840] the every-day life of his times, and has been reprinted in 1855 under the editorship of Ed. Fournier and Ch. Asselineau. The Fureteriana, which appeared in Paris eight years after Furetière’s death, is a collection of but little value.
