FOIL, thin silvered sheet-copper, highly polished, and coated with mixtures of isinglass and transparent colours, is employed by jewellers to place at the back of paste and inferior stones to improve their tints and lustre. Copper foil, known also as Nuremberg or German foil, is made from thin hammered copper plates by heating between sheets of iron, boiling in solution of tartar and salt, drying, hammering, and lastly polishing with whiting on a convex smooth surface of copper.
