FIELDING, Anthony Vandyke Copley (1787-1855), commonly called Copley Fielding, an English landscape-painter, became at an early age a pupil of John Varley. He took to the water-colour method of art, and to this he confined himself almost exclusively. In 1810 he became an associate exhibitor in the Water-colour Society, in 1813 a full member, and in 1831 president of that body. He also engaged largely in teaching the art. His death took place at Worthing in March 1855. Fielding was a painter of much elegance, taste, and accomplishment, without reaching very high in originality of purpose or of style: he painted all sorts of views, including marine subjects in large proportion. Five specimens of his work are to be seen in the water-colour gallery of the South Kensington Museum, of dates ranging from 1829 to 1850. Among the engraved specimens of his art is the Annual of British Landscape Scenery, published in 1839.
