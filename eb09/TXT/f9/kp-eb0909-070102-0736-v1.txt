FRANCK or FRANK, Sebastian (c. 1500-1543), not unfrequently called by the Latinized form of his name Francus, an important German writer of the Reformation period, was born about 1500 at Donauworth, and regularly styled himself Franck of Word. Of his early years nothing is known except by inference. It appears that he studied at Heidelberg, and about 1524 was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. In 1528 he married Ottilia Behaim at Nuremberg; and the same year he produced his German translation of Althamer’s Diallage, or Reconciliation of the Contradictions of the Scriptures, and wrote a treatise against the Horrible Vice of Drunkenness. Two years later appeared, with an introduction by Luther, his translation of a Chronicle and Description of Turkey, written by a Transylvanian who had been Twenty-two Years in Turkish Captivity. In 1531 he was in Strasburg, and published his Chronika, Zeitbuch, und Geschichtbibel, one of the first German works in which an attempt was made to give a survey of universal history. From Strasburg he removed to Esslingen; and there during 1532 and 1533 he attempted to support himself by soap-boiling, but found it on the whole an unprofitable occupation. In hope of a better market for his wares he went to Ulm, where in 1534 he received the freedom of the city. For some time he remained peacefully printing his books, but on the publication of his Parodoxa his privileges were withdrawn, and he was ordered to depart. A promise to submit his writings to censure procured a temporary reprieve of the sentence, but in 1539 he was finally banished, and from that time he appears never to have settled long in one place. He was engaged as a printer and publisher at Basel when he died, in 1543 or 1545. Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote also a collection of proverbs (Spruch-Wörter) in 1532, which appeared in fuller form in 1591, a Germanice Chronicon, 1538, and the Guldin Arch or Arca Aurea, 1538, a collection of Scripture doctrines with proof passages, not only from the Bible itself, but also from pagan writers. Franck’s position as α thinker was a peculiar one. Though associated at first with the Reformers, he soon showed that he was out of sympathy with their dogmatic tendencies, and at length was branded by Luther as a “devil’s mouth.” He was naturally inclined to subjectivity and mysticism, and may to a certain extent be regarded as a forerunner of modern German idealism. His religion was practically pantheistic, and tended to foster a spirit of tolerance that found good in everything. Amid the bitter controveries of contending sects it was rare to find a professed theologian maintaining that the true church consisted of “all pious and good-hearted men in all the world, even among the heathen.” As an historian, while still credulous enough to believe in the Trojan myths of the Middle Ages, he displayed a remarkably modern spirit in the attention he gave to social conditions. The first part of his Chronicon, &c., contains the history of antiquity, the second includes the period from Christ to Charles V., and the third gives account of the popes, councils, heretics, ceremonies, <fcc. His German style is plain, vigorous, and idiomatic, and ranks him high among the founders of German prose.
