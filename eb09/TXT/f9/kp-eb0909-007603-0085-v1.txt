FENTON, Sir Geoffrey, a writer and statesman during the reigns of Elizabeth and James I., the brother of Edward Fenton the navigator, who accompanied Sir Martin Frobisher in his expeditions, and was afterwards sent out independently to endeavour to discover a north-west passage. In the capacity of queen’s counsellor Sir Geoffrey served for twenty-seven years in Ireland, where his conduct appears to have given great satisfaction to his royal mistress, notwithstanding that he took every opportunity of impressing on her mind the strong conviction he entertained that the safety and glory of her government in that island depended on her subjects enjoying the protection of equal laws. He died at Dublin, October 19, 1606.

Fenton is best known for his translation of the History of the Wars of Italy by Guicciardini, which he dedicated to Elizabeth. Of his other translations the principal are Certain Tragical Discourses written ou,t of French and Latin, 1567, and Golden Epistles, containing a variety of Discourses, both Moral, Philosophical, and Divine, gatlιered as well out of the remainder of Guevara's works as other authors, Latin, French, and Italian, 1577. The Familiar Epistles of Guevara had been published in English by Edward Fellowes in 1574; Fenton’s collection consists of pieces not contained in that publication.
