FREDERICIA, or Feidericla, a fortified town of Denmark, near the south-east corner of Jutland, on the shores of the Little Belt opposite the island of Funen, about 15 miles S. of Veile. It has railway communication with both south and north, and steamboats ply regularly across the Belt. It is well built, and possesses a handsome townhall, four churches, and a synagogue. There is a considerable shipping trade, and the industries comprise the manufacture of tobacco, salt, and chicory, and of cotton goods and hats. The population in 1870 was 7186. A small fort was erected on the site of Fredericia by Christian IV. of Denmark, and his successor, Frederick III., determined about 1650 to make it a powerful fortress. Free exercise of religion was offered to all who should settle in the new town, which at first bore the name of Frederiksodde, and [9:9:729] only received its present designation in 1664. In 1657 it was taken by storm by the Swedish general Wrangel, and in 1659, after the fortress had been dismantled, it was occupied by Frederick William of Brandenburg. It was not till 1709-10 that the works were again put in a state of defence, and the place even then continued to be of but little importance. In 1848 an attempt was made by the Danes to oppose the Prussians, who entered on May 3, and maintained their position against the Danish cannonboats. During the armistice of 1848-9 the fortress was strengthened, and soon afterwards it stood a siege of two months, which was brought to a glorious close by a successful sortie. In memory of the victory several monuments have been erected in the town and its vicinity, of which the most noticeable are the bronze statue of the Danish Land Soldier by Bissen (one of Thorwaldsenâ€™s best pupils), and the great barrow over 500 Danes in the cemetery of the Holy Trinity Church, with a bas-relief by the same sculptor. On the outbreak of the war of 1864, the fortress was again strengthened by new works and an entrenched camp; but the Danes suddenly evacuated it on 28th April after a siege of six weeks. The Austro-Prussian army partly destroyed the fortifications, and kept possession of the town till the conclusion of peace.
