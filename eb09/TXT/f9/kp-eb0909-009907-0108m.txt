FERNANDEZ, Juan, a Spanish sailor and adventurer. In 1531 he joined the army of the celebrated^ Francesco Pizarro, conqueror of Peru, with a small force, but in 1533 he passed into the service of his rival Pedro de Alvarado. When the latter, however, agreed for a sum of money to cede his claims on Peru and make over his navy to Pizarro and Almagro, Fernandez necessarily returned to the service of Pizarro, who not only granted him pardon, but gave him the command of the ship. In 1538 ho accompanied Antonio de Sedeno on an expedition despatched by the Spanish Government against the island of Trinidad. Instead, however, of attempting to fulfil the purpose of the expedition, they were tempted by rumours of the existence of gold to disembark on the mainland, where, after enduring great privations and hardships, both leaders died in the winter after they set out, without finding the object of their quest. The survivors, under four different^ leaders, and decimated by hunger, fatigue, and continual combats with the natives, managed to find their way to the Spanish settlements.
