FLAG, or Flower de Luce, botanically Iris, the popular name of a genus of perennial plants of the natural order Iridaceae, occurring in north temperate regions, and having the following characters :—Rootstock creeping, horizontal, thick, with dichotomous joints, or tuberous; leaves usually ensiform and equitant; flowers large and showy; the perianth (see Botany, voL iv. p. 144, fig. 268) superior, with the three outer segments large, spreading, or revolute, and frequently bearded at the base, and the three inner smaller, sub-erect, and converging; stamens three, inserted at base of outer segments of perianth, and concealed by the stigmas; anthers extrorse; stigmas three, petaloid, and arching over the stamens; capsule three-celled, dehiscing loculicidally; and seeds numerous, with a fleshy albumen. Many kinds of flag are cultivated in England, but only two species are indigenous. One of these, Iris Pseudacorus, the Yellow Flag or Iris, is common in Britain on river banks, and in marshes and ditches. It is called the “Water-flag” or “bastard Floure de-luce” by Gerard, who remarks that “although it be a water plant of nature, yet being planted in gardens it prospereth well.” Its flowers appear in June and July, and are of a golden-yellow colour. The leaves are from two to four feet long, and half an inch to an inch broad. Towards the latter part of the year they are eaten by cattle. The seeds are numerous and pale-brown; they have been recommended when roasted as a substitute for coffee, of which, however, they have not the properties. The astringent rhizome has diuretic, purgative, and emetic properties, and may, it is said, be used for dyeing black, and in the place of galls for ink-making. The other British species, I. foetidissima, the Fetid Iris, Gladdon, or Roast-beef Plant, the Xyris or StinkingGladdon of Gerard, is a native of England south of Durham, and also of Ireland, southern Europe, and north Africa. Its flowers are usually of a dull, leaden-blue colour; the capsules, which remain attached to the plant throughout the winter, are 2 to 3 inches long; and the seeds scarlet When bruised this species emits a peculiar and disagreeable odour; Among other flags common in Europe are I. Germanica, probably the Illyrian iris of the ancients, the purple blossoms of which are a common ornament of English gardens; I. pallida, a native of Istria, with pale-blue flowers; and L Fiorentina, indigenous to the Macedonian coast and [9:9:280] Asia Minor, having white flowers. The rhizomes or underground stems of these three species constitute the “orrisroot” or rhizoma Iridis of pharmacy, formerly known as « ireos” or “orice,” which is exported in considerable quantity from southern Europe, more especially from the neighbourhood of Leghorn and Trieste. To prepare orrisroot the rhizome is in August dug up and freed of its rootlets and brown outer bark; it is then dried, and packed in casks for sale. Orris-root occurs in commerce in whitish, knobby, sometimes branched pieces, of about the thickness of the thumb, and having on one side numerous pits where the rootlets were attached. It has a bitterish and acrid taste, and is purgative and emetic in properties. By drying it acquires the odour of violets. It is exported to India, where it is called bekhbunufsha (violet-root). By the ancients it was valued both for its odour and its healing virtues; and in England it was in past times in repute as a medicine for various complaints. Gerard states that “the root of the common Flower deduce, cleane washed, and stamped with a few drops of Rose water, and laid plaister-wise upon the face of man or woman, doth in two dayes at the most take away the blacknesse or blewnesse of any stroke or bruse he further advocates the use of the same remedy in dropsy and infirmities of the chest. It is now employed in the preparation of violet-powder, and of scented hair and tooth-powders and oils, as a perfume for the breath, for making issue-peas, and occasionally as an errhine. At the risk of causing irritation of the mouth and disturbance of the bowels, it is sometimes given to teething infants to bite. In America the rhizome of I. versicolor, the Blue Flag, as also that of I. Fiorentina, is employed as a purgative and alterative in strumous complaints. Orris-root contains, besides gum, ligneous matter, and elliptical granules of starch, an acid resin, iridin or irisin, precipitable from the tincture by water, and said in small doses to act as a stimulant of the glandular system; also one-twelfth per cent, of a semisolid substance, the butter or camphor of orris, which consists apparently of myristic acid with a little essential oil, and which with about 15 parts of spirits forms the oil or essence of orris-root. According to some writers the blossom of the iris is represented in the well-known heraldic device, the Fleur-de-lis (q. υ.). The ancient arms of Florence are a red shield bearing a white lily or iris.

The Sweet Flag, or Sweet Sedge, probably the aκopov of Dioscorides, is the species A corns Calamus, L., a plant of the natural order Acoraceae or Orontiaceae. It has a wide distribution, growing in wet situations in the Himalayas, North America, Siberia, and various parts of Europe, including England, and has been naturalized in Scotland and Ireland. The leaves are sweet-scented, and are ensiform, equitant, 3 to 6 feet long, and two-thirds to 1⅛ inches broad; and the spadix is lateral, with bisexual flowers. The rhizome (rhizoma calami aromatici), which has a more powerful odour than the herbage, is creeping, horizontal, and woody; it has been employed as an aromatic stimulant, antispasmodic, and tonic. Sir J. E. Smith Eng. Flora, ü. 158, 2d ed., 1828) mentions it as a popular remedy in Norfolk for ague. In India it is used as an insectifuge, and is administered in infantile diarrhaea. It is an ingredient in pot-pourri, is employed for flavouring beer, and is chewed to clear the voice; and its volatile oil is employed by makers of snuff and aromatic vinegar. The rhizome of Acorus Calamus is sometimes adulterated with that of Iris Pseudacorus, which, however, is distinguishable by its lack of odour, astringent taste, and dark colour.
