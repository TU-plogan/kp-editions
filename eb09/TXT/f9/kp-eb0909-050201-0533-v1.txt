+=====================================================================+


FOX, Richard, an English prelate, statesman, and diplomatist, bishop successively of Exeter, Bath and Wells, Durham, and Winchester, and founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, was born about the close of the reign of Henry VI. He was a native of Roρesley, near Grantham, in Lincolnshire, and his parents are said to have been in humble circumstances. His education, however, was not neglected, for he was sent to school either at Boston or at Winchester, and thence transferred to Magdalen College, Oxford. His studies, in which he gained much distinction, were interrupted by an outbreak of the plague, and he went to continue them at Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. He next went to Paris, and there pursued the study of theology and the canon law, At Paris he became acquainted with Morton, bishop of Ely, then an exile, and by him he was introduced to Henry, earl of Richmond, who was preparing his invasion of England. He at once gained Henry’s confidence, and managed for him the delicate business of getting assistance in men and money from the king of France. After the victory of Bosworth and accession of the earl as Henry VII., Fox, now a doctor of divinity, was made a nrivy councillor, and became one of the most trusted advisers of the king. Honours fell thick upon him. In rapid succession he was made a prebendary of Sarum, bishop of Exeter, keeper of the privy seal, principal secretary of state, and master of St Cross, Winchester (1487). From this time he was almost constantly employed by the king in political affairs both at home and abroad. He was several times sent ambassador to Scotland, and several times to France. In 1491 he was translated to the see of Bath and Wells, and three years later to that of Durham. In 1497 he personally defended his castle of Norham when besieged by the Scots, until it was relieved by the earl of Surrey. The same year he negotiated a truce for seven years between England and Scotland. He also tcok part in the treaty for the marriage between James IV. of Scotland and Margaret, daughter of Henry VII. In 1500 he was chosen chancellor of the university of Cambridge, and held the office for two years. The same year he was translated to the see of Winchester, which he held till his death, a period of twenty-eight years. He was master of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, from 1507 to 1519. During the reign of Henry VII. his influence was supreme in the state, no important affair being undertaken without consulting him. The king named Fox one of his executors, and especially recommended him to his son and successor Henry VIII. But his credit soon declined under the new king, partly owing to the character of Henry, and partly to the rivalry of the earl of Surrey. Amongst the chaplains of Bishop Fox at this time was Thomas Wolsey; and in order to counteract the influence of Surrey, Fox introduced Wolsey to the king. In a little while the new comer took precedence of both the rivals. Fox, however, did not suddenly lose the royal favour. In March 1510 he was sent ambassador to France with Surrey and the bishop of Durham, and signed the treaty of alliance with Louis XII. In 1513 he attended Henry VIII. in his expedition to France, and was present at the taking of Terouenne. The same year he took part in negotiating a treaty with the emperor Maximilian. Fox was one of the executors of Margaret, countess of Richmond, and in this capacity had a share in completing the settlement of St John’s College, Cambridge. Continually mortified by the supremacy of his former protégé, Wolsey, and by the insults he had to endure from him, he at length (1515) withdrew from the court and retired to his diocese. The rest of his life was devoted to the discharge of his ecclesiastical duties and to works of charity and munificence. During this period he rendered great service to the cause of liberal education by his foundation of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. His first intention was to make it a monkish seminary, and for this he obtained a licence. But on the advice of Oldham, bishop of Exeter/ he changed his plan, and made it simply a school for the increase of learning. Bishop Oldham contributed largely to the cost of the buildings. Fox was founder also of free schools at Taunton and at Grantham. He became blind some years before his death, and was pressed by Wolsey to resign his see to him, but this he stoutly refused to do. He died, in a good old age, September 14, 1528.
