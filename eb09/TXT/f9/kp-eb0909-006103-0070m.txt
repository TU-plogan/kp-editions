FECKENHAM, or Fecknam, John de, the last abbot of Westminster, was born of poor parents in Feckenham Forest in Worcestershire. The family name was Howman; and it is noted by Fuller (Worthies of England) that the abbot was the last clergyman who was “locally surnamed.” He was of good parts and fond of learning; and, after receiving instruction from the parish priest, he was sent to the Benedictine monastery of Evesham, whence, at about the age of eighteen, he passed to Gloucester College, Oxford. He afterwards returned to Evesham, and there remained till the dissolution of the monastery in 1536, when he received a pension of a hundred florins. Resuming his studies at Oxford, he took in 1539 his degree of B.D. He was successively chaplain to Bell, bishop of Worcester, and to Bonner, bishop of London. When the latter was deprived of his see (1549), Feckenham was committed to the Tower. His learning and eloquence, however, made him so weighty an advocate that he was temporarily liberated (“borrowed from the Tower,” he says in old English phrase) for the purpose of holding discussions on the points in dispute between Romanists and Protestants. Among these disputations were four with Hooper, bishop of Worcester. Remanded to the Tower, he was released at the accession of Queen Mary and became her chaplain. In rapid succession he was appointed chaplain to Bishop Bonner and prebendary and dean of St Paul’s. He was sent to Lady Jane Grey two days before her execution to commune with her, and “to reduce her,” says Fox, “from the doctrine of Christ to Queen Mary’s religion;” and two months later he was one of the disputants at Oxford against Cranmer, at the martyrdom of Ridley and Latimer. He showed, however, no eagerness of hostility to the martyrs; and indeed throughout Queen Mary’s reign he distinguished himself by generous endeavours in behalf of the persecuted reformers. He also pleaded earnestly for the release of the Lady Elizabeth, thereby offending the queen. In May 1556 the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him by the university of Oxford; and in September following he was made abbot of Westminster, fourteen Benedictine monks being placed under him. Queen Elizabeth on her accession (1558) sent for the abbot and offered him, it is said, the archbishopric of Canterbury, but he could not conform to the new faith. He sat in her first parliament, and was the last mitred abbot that was seen in parliament. His influence there was steadfastly directed against all movements of reformation. In 1560 he was sent to the Tower, and, with intervals of freedom, remained in confinement more or less strict for the rest of his life. He died in Wisbeach Castle, in the Isle of Ely, in 1585. Among the few pieces published by Feckenham are the Conference-Dialogue held between the Lady Jane Grey and himself, and several funeral orations or sermons.
