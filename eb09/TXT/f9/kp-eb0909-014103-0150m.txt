FIELD, Nathan, a dramatist and actor of the time of Elizabeth, was probably born about but not later than 1587. He was the son of the rector of Cripplegate, the Rev. John Field, and early became one of the children of Queen Elizabeth’s chapel, and in 1600 he played one of the principal parts in Ben Jonson’s Cynthia's Bevels, which was acted by children. Next year he played in the Poetaster, in 1607 in Bussy d,'Ambois, and in 1608 in Epicene, on which occasion his is the only name among the “children” of 1600 which still remains. In 1612, when he must have been very young, he brought out his first play, the original comedy of A Woman is α Weathercock, in which the inconstancy of woman is made a theme fertile in humour. In 1613 he was engaged with Daborne in writing a play which has not been handed down to us; and soon afterwards we find these two authors, in conjunction with Massinger, praying Henslowe for a small sum of money to free them from imprisonment. In 1618 Field printed Amends far Ladies, in which he reversed the judgment of his first comedy, and, in the persons of a virtuous maid, wife, and widow, vindicated womankind against himself. It has been supposed that Field had some hand in editing the first folio Shakespeare in 1623; he certainly assisted Massinger in that year in composing his tragedy of The Fatal Dowry, and the play bears evident traces of his co-operation. In 1639 he reprinted the Amends for Ladies, and in 1641 he was dead. There exists a portrait of Field in Dulwich College. He was the poetic “son” of George Chapman, and the associate of many dramatic poets of that age. His elder brother Theophilus, also a writer of verse, entered the church, and rose to be bishop of Llandaff and afterwards of Hereford. The two unassisted plays of Nathan Field are comedies of contemporary London life, and are mainly written in very smooth and flowing blank verse. They contain one or two lyrics, which, in conjunction which certain passages in The Fatal Dowry, prove Field to have surpassed Massinger in lyrical power. Amends for Ladies is greatly superior to its companion play in animation, plausibility, and humour; but the passages between Scudmore and Bellafront in A Woman is a Weathercock perhaps display the serious style of Field at its best. His song “Rise, lady mistress, rise,” in Amends for Ladies, is a charming aubade. It is to be regretted that we possess so little of the work of this bright and sensible writer. His plays have never been collected.
