MORIER, James (1780-1849), traveller and author, was born in 1780. Through the influence of his uncle Admiral William Waldegrave, Baron Radstock, he at an early period entered the diplomatic service, and as secretary to Lord Elgin followed the grand vizier in the Egyptian campaign. An account of his Eastern experiences was published in 1812, under the title A Journey through Persia, Armenia, and Asia Minor to Constantinople in 1808-9. From 1810 to 1816 he was the English representative at the court of Persia, and after his return he published A Second Journey through Persia to Constantinople between the years 1810 and 1816. His knowledge of Eastern life and manners he also turned to account in the composition of several entertaining romances, displaying some skill in the delineation of Oriental scenery and character, and considerable powers of wit and humour. The most popular of these were:â€” The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan, 1824; The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan in England, 1828; Zohrdb the Hostage, 1832; and Ayesha the Maid of Kars, 1834. Morier died at Brighton, 23d March 1849.
