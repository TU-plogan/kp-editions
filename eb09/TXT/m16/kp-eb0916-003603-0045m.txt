MERIDA, the capital of the Mexican state of Yucatan, stands in a great plain in the north of the peninsula, on a surface of limestone rock, about 25 miles from the port of Progreso on the Gulf of Mexico, with which it is connected by a railway opened in 1880. It is a well-built city, with broad streets and squares; and the flat-roofed stone houses, after the style introduced by the Spaniards, give a Moorish colour to the general view. Besides the cathedral, an imposing edifice of the 16 th century, the bishop’s palace, and the Government house (all of which are situated in the principal square), the most notable building is the Franciscan monastery (1547-1600), which once harboured within its high and turreted walls no fewer than two thousand friars, but has been allowed to fall into complete decay since their expulsion in 1820. For a long time Merida has had the reputation of being one of the principal seats of culture in Mexico; and it possesses, besides the ecclesiastical seminary, schools of law, medicine, and pharmacy, a literary institute, a public library, a theatre, and a considerable number of periodical publications. Commercially it has shared in the prosperity which Yucatan in recent years owes to the development of the Sisal hemp trade; and its manufactures embrace cotton goods, cigars, sugar, and rum. The population, estimated about 1840 as 25,000, was found in 1871 to number 33,025. The Mayasstill form numerically the strongest element. Previous to the Spanish conquest the site of Merida was occupied by the Maya town of Tehoo, which contained so great a number of artificial stone-mounds that the new-comers had abundant material for all their buildings. The foundation of the [9:16:37] city dates from 1542, and it was made a bishopric in 1561. Compare Stephen’s Yucatan.
