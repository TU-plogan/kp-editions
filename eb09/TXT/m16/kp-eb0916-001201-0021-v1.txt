MENSHIKOFF, Alexander Danilovich (1672-1729), born at Moscow on the 17th of November (o.s.) 1672, was the son of a poor man, who employed him to sell cakes about the streets of that city. In this humble occupation he attracted the attention of Lefort, one of Peter the Great’s most active co-operators, who was pleased with his sprightliness, and took him into his service. Peter, soon afterwards [9:16:13] seeing the youth at Lefort’s, was also delighted with him, and took him to be his page. Menshikoff soon became indispensable to the czar, assisting him in his workshop, and displaying signal bravery in the company of his master at the siege of Azoff. He formed one of the suite of Peter during his travels, and worked with him at Saardam and Deptford. Throughout his wars with the Swedes, Menshikoff was the companion of the czar, and greatly distinguished himself. For his gallantry at the battle of the Neva, on the 7th of May (o.s.) 1703, he received the order of St Andrew. In 1704 he was made general, and at the request of the czar created a prince of the Holy Roman Empire. His house on the Vasilii-Ostroff was magnificent; there ambassadors were received, and banquets were given gorgeous with gold and silver plate. Unfortunately there is a dark side to the picture, and the favourite was guilty of extortion to such an extent as to bring him under his master’s censure. On the death of Peter the position of Menshikoff became very perilous; his successes had raised about him a host of enemies eager for his downfall. The Golitzins, Dolgoroukis, and all those who formed what may be called the Old Russian party, wished to proclaim the son of Alexis emperor. Those, however, whose aggrandizement was bound up with Peter’s reforms—Menshikoff, Apraksin, Bontourlin, Goloff kin, and others—were in favour of giving the crown to Peter’s widow, who accordingly ascended the throne as Catherine I. During her reign the influence of Menshikoff was unbounded, and he virtually governed the country; but the empress died in 1727, after a reign of two years. She had made a will, no doubt at the instigation of the favourite, to the effect that Peter, her grandson, was to be czar under the guardianship of Menshikoff, whose daughter Mary was to be married to the youthful sovereign. Under pretence of taking care of the young czar, Menshikoff caused him to be removed to his house and surrounded him with his creatures. He was now at the height of his power; foreign ambassadors remarked that even the great Peter himself was never feared so much. The young czar, however, showed no affection for Mary Menshikoff, and the girl was equally apathetic towards her betrothed, being in love with a member of the family of Sapieha at the time her father had forced her into the engagement. The Dolgoroukis used the aversion of the young prince to his fiancee as a means of creating dislike to the father. A chain of events was gradually leading to the downfall of the favourite. He was soon refused admittance to the summer palace, whither the young czar had retired. Next he was arrested, and so overpowered was he at his disgrace that he had an apoplectic stroke. In vain did he address letters both to the emperor and his sister. Shortly after, by order of the czar, the fallen magnate departed from St Petersburg, but more like a nobleman retiring to his estate than a culprit going into exile. The people regarded him with dislike, and most of them rejoiced over his fall. On his way a courier arrived with orders to take the czar’s ring of betrothal from his daughter Mary and give her back her own, which had been worn by Peter ∏. Menshikoff was not permitted to pass through Moscow, but was conducted to Oranienburg, in the government of Riazan, and there placed under strict surveillance. Soon afterwards the whole family was banished to Siberia, and arrived at Berezoff towards the end of 1727. Menshikoff’s wife died on the journey, and was buried near Kazan. On the arrival of the prisoners they were lodged in a wooden house, consisting of four rooms. But Menshikoff did not long endure the horrors of exile in this inclement region. According to Mannstein, he died (November 12, o.s., 1729) of an apoplectic stroke, because there was no one at Berezoff, as he himself remarked, who understood how to open a vein. The young czar ordered the release from exile of the two remaining children of Menshikoff,—his daughter Mary had died at Berezoff in the same year as her father,—and restored some of their property to them.
