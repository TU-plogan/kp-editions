MORIN, Jean, or, in Latin, Joannes Morinus (1591- 1659), the most learned Catholic theologian of his time and one of the founders of Biblical criticism, was born in 1591 at Blois of Protestant parents, acquired Latin and Greek at Rochelle, and continued his studies at Leyden. Immersed in Biblical and patristic lore, he began to waver in his Protestantism, and moved to Paris, where he made many friends in literary circles, particularly Cardinal Du Perron, to whom his conversion to Catholicism is ascribed. In 1618 he joined the recently formed Parisian Oratory, where he could give himself to quiet study, and in due course took priest’s orders. In 1625 he visited England in the train of Henrietta Maria, and in 1640 he was at Rome, on the invitation of Cardinal Barberini, and was received with special favour by Pope Urban VIII., who employed him on the commission for forwarding his project of union with the Eastern Church. He was, however, soon recalled to Paris by Richelieu, and the rest of his life was spent among books in incessant literary labour, his health, memory, and intellectual vigour remaining unimpaired even in old age. His pen sometimes brought him into trouble. The Histoire de la délivrance de Γ Eglise Chrétienne par l'emp. Constantin, et de la grandeur et souveraineté temporelle donnée a VEglise Romaine par les rois de France (1630) gave great offence at Rome, and a [9:16:825] Déclaration (1654), directed against faults in the administration of the Oratory and reflecting on the general (Father Bourgoing), was strictly suppressed. So, too, his great work on penance gave equal offence to the Jesuits and to Port-Royal, and even after his death (1659) the polemical vehemence of his Exercitationes Biblicae, and the exaggeration of his assertion “apud neotericos Haereticos verba Scripturarum non esse integra, non superficiem, non folia, nedum sensum, medullam et radicem rationis” long led Protestants to treat his valuable contributions to the history of the Hebrew text as a mere utterance of Popish prejudice.

Morinus was a voluminous and prolix writer on ecclesiastical antiquities. His principal works in this field are Commentarius historicus de disciplina in administratione sacramenti poenitentiae XIII primis seculis in Eccl. Occid. et hucusque in Orient, observata (1651), and Comm. de sacris Ecclcsiae ordinationibus secundum antiquos et recentiores Latinos, Graecos, Syros et Babylonios (1655). The second of these works expresses those irenical views on the subject of ordination which recommended Morinus to Urban VIII. The literary correspondence of Morinus appeared in 1682 under the title of Antiquitates Ecclesiae Orientalis (edited by R. Simon).

The chief fame of Morinus, however, now rests on his Biblical and critical labours. By his editio princeps of the Samaritan Pentateuch and Targum, in the Paris Polyglott, he gave the first impulse in Europe to the study of this dialect, which he acquired without a teacher (framing a grammar for himself) by the study of MSS. then newly brought to Europe. Not unnaturally he formed a very exaggerated view of the value of the Samaritan tradition of the text, exalting it above the tradition of the Jews {Exercitationes in utrum-que Samaritanorum Pentateuchum, 1631). A similar tone of exaggerated depreciation of the Hebrew text, coloured, as has been remarked above, by polemical bias against Protestantism, mars his greatest work, the posthumous Exercitationes biblicae de Hebraeici Graecique textus sinceritate (1660), in which, following in the footsteps of Cappellus, but with incomparably greater learning, he brings irrefragable arguments against the then current theory of the absolute integrity of the Hebrew text of the Old Testament, and the antiquity of the vowel points. The second part of this work is still valued as a copious storehouse of materials for the history of the Hebrew text collected by the most self-denying labour— meis ingratiis, as he said himself.
