METELLUS, the name of the most important family of the Roman plebeian gens Caecilia. They rose to distinction during the Second Punic War, and Naevius satirized them.

Quintus Caecilius Metellus Macedonicus, praetor 148 b.c. in Macedonia, defeated Andriscus in two battles, and forced him to surrender. He then superintended the conversion of Macedonia into a Roman province. He tried unsuccessfully to mediate between the Achaean league and Sparta, but, when the Achaeans advanced, he defeated them easily near Scarpheia; Mummius soon after superseded him, and returning to Italy he triumphed in 146. Consul in 143, he reduced northern Spain to obedience. In 131 censor with Q. Pompeius (the first two plebeian censors), he proposed that all citizens should be compelled to marry. He was a moderate reformer, and was considered the model of a fortunate man; before his death in 115 three of his sons had been consuls, one censor, and the fourth was a candidate for the consulship.

Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus, whose reputation for integrity was such that when he was accused of extortion the jury refused to examine his accounts, was selected to command against Jugurtha in 109 b.c. He subjected the army to rigid discipline, and aimed solely at seizing Jugurtha himself; he defeated the king by the river Muthul, and next year, after a difficult march through the desert, took his stronghold Thala. Marius, however, accused Metellus of protracting the war, and received the consulate for 107. Metellus returned to Rome and triumphed. Saturninus, whom as censor he tried to remove from the senate, passed in 100 an agrarian law, inserting a provision that all senators should swear to it within five days. All complied but Metellus, who retired to Asia. After Saturninus was killed, he returned, but died shortly after under suspicion of poison.

Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius, so called from his efforts to restore his father Numidicus, commanded in the Social War, defeating Q. Pompaedius (88 b.c.). Sulla cn departing gave him proconsular command over South Italy. When Marius returned, the soldiers, who had no confidence in Octavius, wished Metellus to command, but he refused. Metellus retired to Africa and afterwards to Liguria, resuming his former command on Sulla’s return. In 86 he gained a decisive victory over Norbanus at Faventia. In Sulla’s proscriptions he pleaded in favour of moderation. Consul in 80 with Sulla, he went to Spain next year against Sertorius, who pressed him hard till the arrival of Pompeius in 76. Next year Metellus defeated Sertorius’s lieutenant Hirtuleius at Italica and Segovia, and joining Pompeius rescued him from the consequences of a check at Sucro. From this time Sertorius grew weaker till his murder in 72. Metellus had previously set a price on his head. In 71 he returned to Rome and triumphed. He was an upright man, of moderate ability.

Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio, son of Scipio Nasica, was adopted by the preceding. He was accused of bribery in 60 b.c., and defended by Cicero. In August 52 Pompeius procured him the consulate. Scipio in return supported Pompeius, now his son-in-law. On war being resolved on, Scipio was sent to Syria. His extortions were excessive, and he was about to plunder the temple of Artemis at Ephesus when he was recalled by Pompeius. He commanded the centre at Pharsalus, and afterwards went to Africa, where by Cato’s influence he received the command. In 46 he was defeated at Thapsus; in his flight to Spain he was stopped by a corsair, and stabbed himelf. His connexion with two great families gave him importance; but he was selfish and licentious, and his violence drove many from his party.

Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer, praetor 63 b.c., was sent to cut off Catiline’s retreat northward. Consul in 61, his personal influence prevented the holding of the Compitalia, which the senate had forbidden and the tribunes permitted. He opposed the agrarian law of the tribune I.. Flavius, and stood firm even though imprisoned; the law had to be given up. He also tried, though fruitlessly, to obstruct Caesar’s agrarian law in 59. He died that year under suspicion of poison given by his wife Clodia.
