MONTGOMERY, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of the Punjab, lying between 29° 58' and 31° 33' N. lat., and between 72° 29' and 74° 10' E. long., is bounded on the N.E. by Lahore, on the S.E. by the river Sutlej, on the S.W. by Mûltân, and on the N.W. by Jhang. The area is 5573 square miles. Montgomery district, formerly known as Gugaira, occupies a wide extent of the Bâri Doâb, or wedge of land between the Sutlej and the Râvi, besides stretching across the latter river into the adjoining Rechna Doâb. In the former tract a fringe of cultivated lowland skirts the bank of either river, but the whole interior upland consists of a desert plateau partially overgrown with brushwood and coarse grass, and in places with impenetrable jungle. On the farther side of the Râvi, again, the country at once assumes the same desert aspect.

The census of 1868 returned the population at 359,437 (males 200,016, females 159,421), viz., Hindus, 69,805; Mohammedans, 277,291; Sikhs, 12,286; and “others,” 55. The Jâts, or pastoral tribe, form the most distinctive class in the district. They bear the name of “Great Râvi,” in contradistinction to the purely agricultural classes, who are contemptuously styled 4 ‘ Little Râvi.” They possess a fine physique, with handsome features, claim a Rajput ancestry, and despise all who handle the plough. In former days they exercised practical sovereignty over the agricultural tribes. Only two towns in the district contain over 5000 inhabitants, viz., Pak Pattan (6086) and Kamalia (5695). The town of Montgomery, the headquarters station, had a population of only 2416 in 1868.

Out of a total assessed area of 3,569,746 acres, only 538,240 arc returned as under cultivation. In 1872-73 the rdbi (or spring harvest) acreage was as follows:—wheat (the chief crop), 162,989 acres; barley, 30,134; gram, 21,416; mustard, 2077; and tobacco, 1303 acres. In the same year the kharif{or autumn harvest) acreage was:— -jodr, 20,509 acres; rice, 18,727; cotton, 16,916; til, 12,457; kangni, 9493; and sugar-cane, 498 acres. Irrigation is practised from rivers, canals, and wells; the total area irrigated by public works is 66,495 acres, and by private works, 158,709. The desert uplands afford after the rains a scanty pasturage for the scattered herds of the Great Râvi Jâts, and yield an impure carbonate of soda (sajji) from the alkaline plants with which they abound. The commercial staples include wheat, rice, gram, millets, cotton, wool, ghi, hides, and sajji. Large numbers of camels are bred for exportation. The imports comprise sugar, salt, oil, English piece goods, metals, indigo, and fruits. The manufactures consist of country cloth, coarse striped silk, and lacquered wood-work. The Lahore and Mûltân railway intersects the district, which is also traversed in every direction by good unmetalled highways. The revenue of the district in 1871-72 amounted to £47,954, of which £42,355 was derived from the land-tax. Education in 1871-72 was afforded by 59 aided and unaided schools, with a total of 1417 pupils. The average annual rainfall for the seven years ending 1872-73 was 9'6 inches.

From time immemorial the Rechna Doâb has formed the home of a wild race of pastoral Jâts, who have constantly maintained a sturdy independence against the successive rulers of northern India. The historians of Alexander’s invasion mention a tribe called the Cathaeans, who probably had their capital at Sangala in the Jhang district, and the Malli with their metropolis at Mûltân, as in possession of this part of the country. The sites of Kot Kamalia and Harappa in Montgomery contain large mounds of antique bricks and other ruins, while many other remains of ancient cities [9:16:790] or villages lie scattered along the river bank, or dot the now barren stretches of the central waste, clearly marking the former existence of a considerable population. The pastoral tribes of this barren expanse do not appear to have paid more than a nominal allegiance to the Moslem rulers, and even in later days, when Ranjit Sinh extended the Sikh supremacy as far as Mùltân, the country yielded little or no revenue, and the population for the most part remained in a chronic state of rebellion. British influence was first exercised in the district in 1847, when an officer was deputed to effect a summary settlement of the land revenue. Direct British rule was effected on the annexation of the Punjab in 1849. The only incident since then was a general rising of the wild clans during the mutiny of 1857, several actions being fought before the clans were defeated and dispersed and order restored.
