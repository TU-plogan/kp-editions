MONTROSE, a royal and parliamentary borough and seaport of Forfarshire, Scotland, is situated on the German Ocean at the mouth of the South Esk, on a branch of the Caledonian Railway, 30 miles east-north-east of Dundee, and 38 south-south-west of Aberdeen. Its harbour basin, formed by the estuary of the South Esk, has an area of about 4 square miles, and is dry at ebb-tide, but at high water there is a depth of about 18 feet at the bar. The length of the quays and docks is about lj miles. The South Esk is crossed by a suspension bridge erected in 1829 at a cost of £20,000, and having a length from the points of suspension of 422 feet (with its approaches 800 feet). On the links to the east of the town is one of the finest golfing greens in Scotland. In the High Street, which is of considerable width, and contains several very lofty houses, there are monuments to Sir Robert Peel and to Joseph Hume, formerly member for the Montrose boroughs. The principal buildings are the parish church—one of the largest churches in Scotland—the town-house, the infirmary, and the academy. There is a public library with 19,000 volumes, and a mechanics’ library with 7000 volumes. Besides the staple industry of flax-spinning, there are manufactures of linen, sail-cloth, sheetings, starch, and soap. Iron-founding, tanning, and brewing are also carried on. The export trade is chiefly in manufactured goods, agricultural produce, and fish; the principal imports are timber and coal. In 1881 the number of ships that entered coastwise was 373 of 48,828 tons, the number that cleared 250 of 21,877 tons; the number engaged in the foreign and colonial trade in the same year was—entered 108 of 34,868 tons, cleared 42 of 10,359 tons. Montrose is also one of the principal fishing-stations in Scotland, the number of registered boats in 1881 being 342 of 4168 tons, giving constant employment to 697 persons, and occasional employment to 300. Montrose joins with Arbroath, Brechin, Forfar, and Inverbervie in returning one member to parliament. The population of the royal burgh in 1871 was 15,720, and 16,280 in 1881; the population of the parliamentary burgh in the same years was 14,452 and 14,975.

Montrose received a charter from David I. in the 12th century, and was made a royal burgh by David II. in 1352. The town was destroyed by fire in 1244. It was from the port of Montrose that Sir James Douglas in 1330 embarked for the Holy Land with the heart of Bruce, and that Prince James Stuart, “the Old Pretender,” set sail in 1716 for France, after the failure of his cause in Scotland. The town is the birtlmlace of Andr ew Melville, of the great marquis of Montrose, and of Joseph Hume.
