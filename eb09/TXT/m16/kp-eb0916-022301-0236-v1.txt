MÉZIÈRES, a fortress of the first class, and the capital of the department of Ardennes, France, is 161 miles to the north-east of Paris by railway, on a peninsula of the Meuse, which almost entirely surrounds the town, and separates it from its more important suburb, Charleville. The fortifications, which, as well as the citadel, are the work of Vauban, are pierced by four gates, giving access to the town, the streets of which are narrow and winding. The parish church, erected in the 16th century, contains two inscriptions in commemoration respectively of the raising of the siege of Mézières in 1521 and the marriage of Charles IX. with the daughter of the emperor Maximilian II., which was celebrated at Mézières in 1570. The north and south portals, the glass of the windows, and the lofty vaultings of the church are worthy of remark. The hôtel de ville contains several interesting pictures relating to the history of the town. The iron industry, the only one of any importance, is being gradually transferred to Charleville. The population in 1881 was 6120.

Founded in the 9th century, Mézières was at first only a stronghold belonging to the bishops of Rheims, which afterwards became the property of the counts of Rethel. The town was increased by successive immigrations of the people of Liege, flying first from the emperor Otho, and afterwards from Charles the Bold; and also by concessions from the counts of Rethel. Its walls were built in the 13th century, and in 1521 it was successfully defended by Bayard against the imperialists. The anniversary of the deliverance of the town is still observed yearly on the 27th of September. The school of military engineering, since transferred successively to Metz and Fontainebleau, was originally founded at Mézières.
