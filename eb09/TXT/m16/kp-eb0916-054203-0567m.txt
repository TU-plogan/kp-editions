MOeSIA (in Greek Mysia, or, to distinguish it from the country of the same name in Asia, Mysia in Europe), in ancient geography the territory immediately to the south of the Danube corresponding in the main to Servia and Bulgaria. It became a Roman province between 27 b.c. and 6 a.d., probably about 16 b.c. ^[1. See A. W. Zumpt, Commentât. Epigraph., ii. 253 sag. ] In the time of Tiberius and Caius the province was under the same governor with Macedonia and Achaia. It was divided by Domitian into two provinces, Moesia Superior (Servia) and Moesia Inferior (Bulgaria); and the same emperor completed the great military road along the line of the Danube, increased the strength of the Roman forces in the country, and, by the conquest of Dacia, saved it from the inroads by which it had been harassed from the time of Tiberius. The Goths invaded Moesia in 250 a.d., and at last, in 395, a number of them, afterwards known as Moesogoths, obtained permission to settle in the province. The Slavonians and Bulgarians appear in the 7th century.

The boundary between Upper and Lower Moesia was not marked, as Ptolemy (iii. 9, 10) states, by the river Cebrus or Ciabrus (Cibritza or Zibru), but, as may be inferred from an inscription (6125, C. Inscr. Lat., vol. iii. 2, additamenta), lay between Almus (Lorn) and Ratiaria (Artcher). Upper Moesia, or, as it was often called, Moesia Prima, contained — Singidunum (Belgrade), headquarters of Legio IV. Flavia, and in the 3d century a colonia; Viminacium (Kostolatz), headquarters of Leg. VII. Claud., and designated sometimes municipium Aelium, but more usually coIonia (a rank bestowed on it by Gordianus); Bononia (Widin); Ratiaria, which, on the loss of Dacia, became the headquarters of Leg. XIII. gemina, and remained a large town till it was destroyed by Attila; Remesiana (Mustapha Pasha Palanka), which has furnished inscriptions belonging to the unidentified Ulpiana; and Naissus (Nissa or Nish), the birthplace of Constantine the Great. Lower Moesia (Moesia Secunda) contained—Oescus (Colonia Ulpia, mod. Gigeu), headquarters, after loss of Dacia, of Leg. V. Maced.; Novae (Sistova), at a late date a camp of Leg. I. Ital., and afterwards chief seat of Theodoric king of the Goths; Nicopolis ad Istrum (Nikup), really on the Iatrus or Yantra, a memorial of Trajan’s victory over the Dacians; Pristra (Rustchuk), Asamus (Nicopoli on the Osina), Darostorum (Silistria), Odessus (Varna), Tomi (Kustendje), Troesmis (Iglitza).
