MONDONEDO, an ancient city of Spain, 27 miles north-north-east from Lugo, in the province of that name, is situated on the Sixto, a small tributary of the Masma, on the Atlantic side of the Cantabrian chain, in a sheltered site surrounded on all sides by considerable hills. The population in 1878 was 10,112. The principal buildings are the cathedral, a Corinthian structure of the 17th century, an ex-convent of Franciscan friars of Alcantara, which is now used for a theatre and a public school, and the civil hospital. The industries, which are unimportant, include lace-making, linen-weaving, and leather manufacture.

According to local tradition, the bishopric of Dumium, near Braga, was transferred to San Martin de Mondonedo (three leagues from Mondonedo) in the 8th century; it was brought to Mondonedo itself by Dona Urraca in the beginning of the 12th century; for about sixty years prior to 1233 the see was at Ribadeo. After having [9:16:720] been for nearly a century and a half in the hands of the Moors, Mondonedo was recaptured by Ordono I. in 858; and the Christian possession was made permanent by Alphonso III. in 870. It was taken by surprise by the French in 1809.
