MILETUS, an ancient city on the southern shore of the Latmic Gulf opposite the mouth of the Maeander. Before the Ionic migration it was inhabited by the Carians (Iliad ii. 876; Herod, i. 146); other authorities call the original people Leleges, who are always hard to distinguish from Carians. The Greek settlers from Pylus under Neleus massacred all the men in the city, and built for themselves a new city on the coast. It occupied a very favourable situation at the mouth of the rich valley of the Maeander, and was the natural outlet for the trade of southern Phrygia (Hipponax, Fr. 45); it had four harbours, one of considerable size. Its power extended inland for some distance up the valley of the Maeander, and along the coast to the south, where it founded the city of Iasus. The trade with the Black Sea, however, was the greatest source of wealth to the Ionian cities. Miletus like the rest turned its attention chiefly to the north, and after a time it succeeded in almost monopolizing the traffic. Along the Hellespont, the Propontis, and the Black Sea coasts it founded more than sixty cities—among them Abydus, Cyzicus, Sinope, Dioscurias, Panticapaeum, and Olbia. All these cities were founded before the middle of the 7th century; and before 500 b.c. Miletus was decidedly the greatest Greek city. During the time when the enterprise and energy of the seafaring population, the d∈ιu<wται, raised Miletus to such power and wealth, nothing is known of its internal history. The analogy of all Greek cities, and some casual statements in later writers, suggest that the usual bloody struggles took place between the oligarchy and the democracy, and that tyrants sometimes raised themselves to supreme power in the city; but no details are known. Miletus was equally distinguished at this early time as a seat of literature. The Ionian epic and lyric poetry indeed had its home farther north; philosophy and history were more akin to the practical race of Miletus, and Thales, Anaximander, Anaximenes, Hecataeus, all belonged to this city. The three Ionian cities of Caria— Miletus, Myus, and Priene—spoke a peculiar dialect of Ionic^[1. The coinage of Miletus during this early period is an important subject on account of the wide commercial connexions of the city. The early electrum coinage belongs to the Phoenician or Graeco-Asiatic standard, which was introduced from Phoenicia and spread over many of the Ionian and Thracian cities through the influence of Milesian trade. Very archaic coins of Miletus, Ephesus, Cyme, and Sardis are known of this standard, and at a somewhat later date of Chios, Samos, Clazomenae, Lampsacus, Abydus, and Cyzicus. The lion is the regular Milesian type, often with a star beside or above him. ]. 1

When the Mermnad kings raised Lydia to be a great military kingdom, Miletus was their strongest adversary. War was carried on for many years, till Alyattes concluded a peace with Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus; the Milesians afterwards seem to have peaceably acknowledged the rule of Croesus. On the Persian conquest Miletus passed under a new master; it headed the revolt of 500 b.c., and was taken by storm after the battle of Lade. Darius treated it with peculiar severity, massacred most of the inhabitants, transported the rest to Ampe at the mouth of the Tigris, and gave up the city to the Carians. Henceforth the history of Miletus has no special interest; it revived indeed when the Persians were expelled from the coast in 479 b.c., and was a town of commercial importance throughout the Graeco-Roman period, when it shared in the general fortunes of the Ionian cities under the rule of Athenians, Persians, Macedonians, Pergamenians, and Romans in succession. Its harbours, once protected by Lade and the other Tragusaean islands, were gradually silted up by the Maeander, and Lade is now a hill some miles from the coast. Ephesus took its place as the great Ionian harbour in the Hellenistic and Roman times. It was the seat of a Christian bishopric, but its decay was sure, and its site is now a marsh.
