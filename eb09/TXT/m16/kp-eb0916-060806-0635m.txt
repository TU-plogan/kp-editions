MOKSHAN, a town of Russia, situated in the government of Penza, 27 miles to the north-west of the capital of the province, and 18 miles from the Ranzay railway station. It has 14,500 inhabitants, who are engaged in agriculture, or work in flour-mills, oil-works, tanneries, and potashworks. A few merchants export corn and flour. Mokshan, which was built in 1535 as a fort to protect the country from the raids of the Tatars and Kalmuks, is supposed to occupy the site of the town of Mescheryaks, Murundza, mentioned as early as the 9th century. It has begun rapidly to increase since the railway between Moscow and Penza was made.
