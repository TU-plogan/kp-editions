MIROPOLIE, a town of Russia, situated in the government of Kursk, district of Suja, 83 miles south-west of Kursk and 25 miles from the Sumy railway station. Il is supposed to have been founded in the 17th century, when it was fortified against the raids of Tartars. The fertility of the soil led to the settlement of large villages close by the fort, and the 10,800 inhabitants of this town are still engaged mostly in agriculture. There is also an extensive manufacture of boots.
