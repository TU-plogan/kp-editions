MONZA (locally Monscia), a city of Italy in the province of Milan, at the branching of the railway for Lecco and Como, lies on the Lambro, a tributary of the Po, mainly on the right bank, in a healthy and attractive situation. Of the mediaeval fortifications little remains save the Porta d’Agrate. The cathedral of St John Baptist is the principal object of interest: Theodelinda’s basilica was enlarged at the close of the 13th century by throwing the atrium into the main building, and the present marble façade was erected about the middle of the 14th by Matteo da Campione. On the left-hand side of the front rises an incongruous brick-built tower, 278 feet high, erected by Peregrini. Within the church are the iron crown of Lombardy (removed by Austria in 1859, and since restored) and the relics of Theodelinda, comprising her crown, fan and comb of gold, and the golden hen and seven chickens, representing Lombardy and her seven provinces. Next to the cathedral in artistic importance come the church of Santa Maria in Istrada, and the broletto or old palace of the commune, usually styled the Arengario: the former (founded in 1357) has a rich Bramantesque façade, reckoned one of the best pieces of terra-cotta work in Lombardy, and the latter is raised on a system of pointed arches, and has a tall square tower terminating in machicolations surrounding a sharp central cone. San Michele was the scene of the coronation of Conrad III. in 1128, and San Gerardo (formerly Sant’ Ambrogio) is named after the patron saint of Monza, Gerardo de’ Tintori, who founded the first k>cal hospital in 1174. The royal palace of Monza (1777), with its extensive gardens and parks, lies not far from the town on the banks of the Lambro. Cotton goods and felt hats are the staple products of Monza industry; then dyeing, organbuilding, and a publishing trade. The population of the city was 15,450 in 1871, and that of the commune increased from 24,661 in 1861 to 28,012 in 1881.

Local antiquaries claim for Monza (Modicia or Modaetia) the rank of a Roman colony, but it cannot have been a place of consequence till it attracted the discerning eye of Theodoric; and, though it was a favourite residence with his immediate successors, its first important associations are with Theodelinda (see vol. xiv. p. 815). During the period of the republics Monza was sometimes independent, sometimes subject to Milan. The Visconti, who ultimately became masters of the city, built a castle in 1325 on the site now occupied by the Palazzo Durini. In the course of its history Monza has stood thirty-two sieges, and been repeatedly plundered, notably by the forces of Charles V. The countship (1499- 1796) was purchased in 1546 by the wealthy banker Durini, and remained in his family till the Revolution.
