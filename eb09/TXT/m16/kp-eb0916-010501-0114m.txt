METCALFE, Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, Baron (1785-1846), a distinguished administrator, was born at Calcutta on January 30, 1785; he was the second son of Thomas Theophilus Metcalfe, then a major in the Bengal army, who afterwards became a director of the East India Company, and was created a baronet in 1802. Having been educated at Eton, where he read extensively, he in 1800 sailed for India as a writer in the service of the Company. After studying Oriental languages with success at Lord Wellesley’s college of Fort William, he, at the age of sixteen, received an appointment as assistant to Lord Cowley, then resident at the court of Sindhia; in 1802 he became assistant in the office of the chief secretary; in 1803 he was transferred to that of the governor-general, and in 1806 to that of the commander-in-chief. On August 15, 1806, he became first assistant to the resident at Delhi, and in 1808 he was selected by Lord Minto for the difficult nost of envoy to the court of RanjitSinh at Lahore; here, [9:16:106] cn April 25, 1809, he successfully concluded the important treaty securing the independence of the Sikh states between the Sutlej and the Jumna. Four years afterwards he was made principal resident at Delhi, and in 1819 he received the appointments of secretary in the secret and political department, and of private secretary to the governor-general (Lord Hastings). From 1820 to 1823 Sir Charles (who succeeded his brother in the baronetcy in 1822) was resident at the court of the nizam, but in the latter year he was compelled by the state of his health to retire from active service; in 1825, however, he was so far restored as to undertake the residency of the Delhi territories. Two years afterwards he obtained a seat in the supreme council, and in February 1835, after he had for some time been governor of Agra, he, as senior member of council, provisionally succeeded Lord William Bentinck in the governor-generalship. During his brief tenure of office (it lasted only till March 28, 1836) he originated or carried out several important measures, including that for the liberation of the press, which, while almost universally popular, complicated his relation with the directors at home to such an extent that he withdrew from the service of the Company in 1838. In the following year he was appointed by the Melbourne administration to the governorship of Jamaica, where the difficulties created by the recent passing of the Negro Emancipation Act had called for a high degree of tact and ability. Sir Charles Metcalfe’s success in this delicate position was very marked (see vol. xiii. p. 551). but unfortunately his health compelled his resignation and return to England in 1842. Six months afterwards he was appointed by the Peel ministry to the governor-generalship of Canada, and his success in carrying out the policy of the home Government was rewarded with a peerage shortly after his return in 1845. He died at Malshanger, near Basingstoke, September 5, 1846. See J. W. Kaye’s Life and Correspondence of Charles Lord Metcalfe, London, 1854.
