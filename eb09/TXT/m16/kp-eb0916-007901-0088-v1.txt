METAMORPHOSIS. This term has been employed in several distinct senses in biology. During the early part of the century it was constantly used to include the current morphological conceptions, as, for instance, of the parts of a flower as modified or “metamorphosed” leaves, or of the segments of a skull as modified vertebrae. It is still frequently employed to denote that progressive change from the general to the special undergone by all developing tissues and organs (see Biology, Embryology), but in this sense is conveniently superseded by the term “differentiation.” In the process of animal development, two types are broadly distinguishable,—a foetal type, in which development takes place wholly or in greater part either within the egg or within the body of the parent, and a larval type, in which the young are born in a condition more or less differing from that of the adult, while the adult stage again is reached in one of two ways, either by a process of gradual change, or by a succession of more or less rapid and striking transformations, to which the term metamorphosis is now usually restricted. Metamorphosis is generally regarded as having been brought about by the action of natural selection, partly in curtailing and reducing the phases of development (an obvious advantage in economy of both structural and functional change), and partly also in favouring the acquirement of such secondary characters as are advantageous in the struggle for existence. Freshwater and terrestrial animals develop without metamorphosis much more frequently than marine members of the same group, a circumstance which has been variously explained. For details of metamorphoses see the articles on the various groups of animals; see also Balfour’s Comparative Embryology, 1880-81.
