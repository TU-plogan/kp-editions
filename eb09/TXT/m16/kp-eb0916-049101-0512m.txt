MINT, botanically Mentha, a genus of labiate plants, comprising about twenty species of perennial herbs, widely distributed throughout the temperate and sub-tropical portions of the globe. All the species are furnished with square stems, opposite, aromatic leaves, and creeping roots. The flowers are arranged in axillary cymes, which either form separate whorls or are crowded together into a terminal spike. The corolla is usually small, and of a pale purple or pinkish colour; it has four nearly equal lobes, and encloses two long and two short stamens. Great difficulty is experienced by botanists in discriminating the species of this genus by reason of the occurrence of a large number of intermediate forms, nearly three hundred of which have been named and described. Many of these varieties are permanent in consequence of being propagated by stolons.

In Britain nine of the recognized species are indigenous. Mentha viridis, I.., or Spearmint, grows in marshy meadows, and is the species commonly used for culinary purposes; it is distinguished by its smooth, sessile leaves and lax tapering flower-spikes. Mentha sylvestris, I.., or Horsemint, chiefly differs from the above in its coarser habit and hairy leaves, which are silky beneath, and in its denser flower-spikes. This plant is supposed to be the mint of Scripture, as it is extensively cultivated in the East, and is much used in cookery; it was one of the bitter herbs with which the paschal lamb was eaten. Μ. rotundifolia resembles the last in size and habit, but is readily distinguished by its rounded wrinkled leaves, which are shaggy beneath, and by its lanceolate bracts. The last two species usually grow on damp waste ground near roadsides. Μ. aquatica, or Capitate Mint, grows in ditches and by the side of streams, and is easily recognized by its rounded flower-spikes and stalked hairy leaves. Μ. Piperita, or Peppermint, has stalked smooth leaves and an oblong obtuse terminal spike of flowers; it is extensively cultivated[9:16:492] for its volatile oil. Μ. pratensis belongs to a group of mints which, unlike the foregoing, have the flowers arranged in axillary whorls and never in terminal spikes; it otherwise bears some resemblance in foliage and habit to Μ. viridis. Μ. sativa, the Whorled Hairy Mint, grows by damp roadsides, and Μ. arvensis in cornfields; they are distinguished from Μ. pratensis by their hairy stalked leaves, which in Μ. arvensis are all equally large, but in Μ. sativa are much smaller towards the apex of the stem. Μ. Pulegium, commonly known as Pennyroyal, more rarely as Flea-mint, has small oval obtuse leaves and flowers in axillary whorls, and is remarkable for its creeping habit and peculiar odour. It differs from all the mints above described in the throat of the calyx being closed with hairs. It is met with in damp places on grassy commons, and forms a well-known domestic remedy for female disorders.

All the plants of the genus Mentha abound in a volatile oil, which is contained in small receptacles having the appearance of resinous dots in the leaves and stems. The odour of the oil is similar in several species, but is not distinctive, the same odour occurring in varieties of distinct species, while plants which cannot be distinguished by any botanical character possess the same odour. Thus the peppermint flavour is found in Μ. Piperita, in Μ. incana, and in Chinese and Japanese varieties of Μ. arvensis. Other forms of the last-named species growing in Ceylon and Java have the flavour of the common garden mint, Μ. viridis, and the same odour is found to a greater or less degree in Μ. sylvestris, Μ. rotundifolia, and Μ. canadensis. A bergamot scent is met with in a variety of Μ. aquatica and in forms of other species. Most of the mints may be found in blossom in August.

The name mint is also applied to plants of other genera, Monarda punctata being called Horsemint, Pycnanthemum linifolium, Mountain Mint, and Nepeta Cataria, Catmint.
