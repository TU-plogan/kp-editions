MITFORD, Mary Russell (1786-1855), born at Alresford, Hampshire, on the 16th of December 1786, retains an honourable place in English literature as the authoress of Our Village, a series of sketches of village scenes and characters unsurpassed in their kind, and after half a century of imitations as fresh as if they had been written yesterday. Washington Irving was Miss Mitford’s literary model, but her work is thoroughly original and spontaneous, the free outflow of a singularly charming character. The shortest account of her life would be incomplete without a reference to the scapegrace father who was the centre of her affections, and the “only begetter” of all that is most delightful and characteristic in her writing. Dr Mitford first spent his wife’s fortune in a few years; then he spent also in a few years the greater part of £20,000 which his daughter drew (in 1797, at the age of ten) as a prize in a lottery; then he lived, for most years of his life, on a small remnant of his fortune and the proceeds of his daughter’s literary industry. In the little village of Three Mile Cross, near Reading, in a small cottage which Miss Mitford says was “a fine lesson in condensation,” the doctor was the stay, support, and admiration of all the loafers in the neighbourhood, while his daughter, who had called herself his mamma, and treated him as her little boy from the time when she was herself a little girl, found an unfailing charm in his “friskings,” and was the loving slave of all his good-humoured exactions. The father kept fresh in his daughter the keen delight in incongruities, the lively sympathy with self-willed vigorous individuality, and the womanly tolerance of its excess which inspire so many of her sketches of character. The woman who lived in close attendance on such an “awful dad,” refused all holiday invitations because he could not live without her, and worked incessantly for him, except when she broke off her work to read him the sporting newspapers, evidently wrote from the heart in her bright portraits of such characters as the Talking Lady, the Talking Gentleman, Joel Brent, Jack Rapley, Tom Cordery, Lizzy, Lucy, and Harriet. Her writing has all the charm of perfectly unaffected spontaneous humour, combined with quick wit and exquisite literary skill. She died January 10, 1855.

Miss Mitford’s youthful ambition was to be “the greatest English poetess,” and her first publications were poems in the manner of Coleridge and Scott (Miscellaneous Verses, 1810, of sufficient mark to be reviewed by Scott in the Quarterly; Christine, a metrical tale, 1811; Blanche, 1813). Later on she essayed writing plays (Julian, 1823; The Foscari, 1826; Dramatic Scenes, 1827; Rienzi, 1828; Charles the First, 1828). But the prose to which she was driven by domestic necessities has rarer qualities than her verse. The first series of Our Village sketches appeared in 1824, a second in 1826, a third in 1828, a fourth in 1830, a fifth iu 1832, and Belford Regis, a novel in which the neighbourhood and society of Reading were idealized, in 1835. Her Recollections of a Literary Life (1853) is a series of causeries about her favourite books. Five volumes of her Life and Letters were published in 1870 and 1872, showing her to have been a delightful letter-writer; two volumes of letteι - s to her appeared in 1882.
