MONS, a town of Belgium, the capital of the province of Hainault, on the rivers Haine and Trouille, and 31 miles south-west of Brussels. The population in 1880 was 25,600. Mons is divided by the river Trouille into an upper and lower town, the first built on rising ground in the shape of an amphitheatre, the second extending into the plain; four bridges connect the two. The place is pleasing and cheerful of aspect, having broad well-paved streets and handsome squares. The fortifications, once among the strongest of the Continent, have quite recently been razed, their site being now occupied by an extensive avenue or boulevard. Among the monuments worthy of mention are—the church of St Waudru, one of the best types of original architecture to be found in Belgium; the church of St Elizabeth, a combination of the Gothic style and the Corinthian; the town-hall, erected in 1458; and the belfry tower, next to which formerly rose the old castle of the counts of Hainault, the demolition of which led, a few years ago, to the discovery of some curious mural paintings belonging to the 12th century. Mons possesses a military arsenal, a school of engineering, and a public library of importance; the administration of law and government for the province is concentrated there. It contains manufactures of cotton, velvet, cloth, muslin, soap, and clay pipes; also brass-foundries, tan-yards, and breweries, and a market of some note for agricultural produce, cattle, horses, and tobacco. The main source of the wealth and prosperity of Mons is derived from the collieries which exist in its vicinity, and yield annually between two and three million tons of first-class coal, the greater part of which is carried into France; in the immediate neighbourhood of the town are the large and important villages of Jemmapes, Quaregnon, Frameries, Pâturages, Wasmes, and Dour, each with a population of from ten to twelve thousand inhabitants; these localities, together with many others somewhat less peopled, form an agglomeration called the Borinage, rich in coal-mines, in iron-foundries, in stone and marble quarries, and may be considered as one of the busiest centres in the world.

Mons is built on the site of a Roman camp erected by Julius [9:16:762] Caesar, and afterwards occupied by a brother of Cicero, who was besieged there by Ambiorix, chief of the Eburones. In the 8th century a lady of the name of Waudru or Waltrud, countess of Hainault, founded a convent, which became the centre of the town. In 804 Charlemagne made it the capital of the county of Hainault; it was fortified in 1148. Baldwin VI., afterwards Latin emperor of Constantinople, was very active in promoting the interests of Mons, and endowed it with a celebrated charter in the year 1200. After being reduced by nearly one half by the plague, Mons received within its walls the Jews whom Philip the Long had expelled from France. The city attained its highest degree of prosperity under Charles V., but its greatness was arrested during the government of the duke of Alva by civic disturbances, which lasted until the reign of Albert and Isabella. In more recent times Mons has had to pay tribute to the warlike spirit of its neighbours; it was taken by Louis XIV. in 1691, given back in 1697, and retaken in 1701 and again in 1709. In 1748 it fell into the hands of Austria; the Belgian insurgents stormed it in 1789; the French in 1792, when Dumouriez won the battle of Jemmapes under its walls; in 1814 it belonged to the Netherlands, and has formed part of the Belgian kingdom since 1830.
