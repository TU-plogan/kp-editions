MÉRIDA, a city of 7390 inhabitants (1877), in the province of Badajoz, Spain, lies about 36 miles by rail eastward from Badajoz, on the Madrid and Badajoz line, on a small eminence on the right bank of the Guadiana. It is connected by a branch line of rail with Llerena on the south-east. The population is mostly agricultural. The city owes its interest entirely to its Roman remains, which are numerous and extensive. Of these one of the most important is the bridge of 81 arches of granite, erected by Trajan; it is 2575 feet long, 26 feet broad, and 33 feet above the bed of the river; it was unfortunately seriously injured during the siege of Badajoz in 1812. Of the colossal wall that formerly surrounded the town all that remains is a fine fragment, built of dressed stone, on the spot formerly occupied by the castellum, and where the provisor of the order of Santiago afterwards had his residence (El Conventual). In the town are some relics of temples of Diana, Mars, Fortuna, Jupiter, and others; and the Arco de Santiago, 44 feethigh, also dates from Trajan’s time; it has unfortunately been stripped of its marble casing. Of the aqueduct from the laguna of Albuera thirty-seven enormous piers are still standing, with ten arches in three tiers built of brick and granite. To the east of the city is the circus, measuring some 1356 by 335 feet; the eight rows of seats still remain. Further eastward is the almost perfect theatre, and near it are the remains of the amphitheatre, or, as some prefer to call it, naumachia (Bano de los Romanos).

Augusta Emerita was built in 25 b.c. by the emeriti of the fifth and tenth legions who had served in the Cantabrian war under Augustus. It rose to great splendour and importance as the capital of Lusitania. During the Gothic period it became an episcopal see, and several provincial councils known to history were held there. It was taken by Mιisa in 711, and reconquered by Alphonsoin 1228.
