MIRANDA, Francesco (1754-1816), was born at Santa Fé in New Granada in 1754. He entered the army, and served against the English in the American War of Independence. The success of that war inspired him with a hope of being the Washington of his own country, and a belief that the independence of Spanish America would increase its material prosperity. With these views he began to scheme a revolution, but his schemes were discovered and he had only just time to escape to the United States. Thence he went to England, where he was introduced to Pitt, but chiefly lived with the leading members of the opposition—Fox, Sheridan, and Romilly. Finding no help in his revolutionary schemes, he travelled over the greater part of Europe, notably through Austria and Turkey, till he arrived at the court of Russia, where he was warmly received, but from which he was dismissed, though with rich presents, at the demand of the Spanish ambassador, backed up by the envoy of France. The news of the dispute between England and Spain about Nootka Sound in 1790 recalled him to England, where he saw a good deal of Pitt, who had determined to make use of him to “insurge” the Spanish colonies, but the peaceful arrangement of the dispute again destroyed his hopes. In April 1792 he went to Paris, with introductions to Pétion and the leading Girondists, hoping that men who were working so hard for their own freedom might help his countrymen in South America. France had too much to do in fighting for its own freedom to help others; but Miranda’s friends sent him to the front with the rank of general of brigade. He distinguished himself under Dumouriez, was intrusted in February 1793 with the conduct of the siege of Maestricht, and commanded the left wing of the French army at the disastrous battle of Neerwinden. Although he had given notice of Dumouriez’s projected treachery, he was put on his trial for treason on May 12. He was unanimously acquitted, but was soon again thrown into prison, and not released till after the 9th Thermidor. He again mingled in politics, and was sentenced to be deported after the struggle of Vendémiaire. Yet he escaped, and continued in Paris til) the coup d’état of Fructidor caused him finally to take refuge in England. He now found Pitt and Dundas once more ready to listen to him, and the latter sent a special minute to Colonel Picton, the governor of Trinidad, to assist General Miranda’s schemes in every possible way; but, as neither of them would or could give him substantial help, he went to the United States, where President Adams gave him fair words but nothing more. Once more he returned to England, [9:16:499] where Addington might have done something for him but for the signature of the peace of Amiens in 1802. At the peace, though in no way amnestied, he returned to Paris, but was promptly expelled by the First Consul, who was then eager to be on good terms with the court of Spain. Disappointed in further efforts to get assistance from England and the United States, he decided to make an attempt on his own responsibility and at his own expense. Aided by two American citizens, Colonel Smith and Mr Ogden, he equipped a small ship, the “Leander,” in 1806, and with the help of the English admiral Sir A. Cochrane made a landing near Carâcas, and proclaimed the Colombian republic. He had some success, and would have had more had not a false report of peace between France and England caused the English admiral to withdraw his support. At last in 1810 came his opportunity; the events in Spain which brought about the Peninsular War had divided the authorities in Spanish America, some of whom declared for Joseph Bonaparte, others for Ferdinand VII., while others again held to Charles IV. At this moment Miranda again landed, and had no difficulty in getting a large party together who declared a republic both in Venezuela and New Granada or Colombia. But Miranda’s desire that all the South American colonies should rise, and a federal republic be formed, awoke the selfishness and pride of individual provincial administrations, and thus weakened the cause, which further was believed to be hateful to heaven owing to a great earthquake on March 26, 1812. The count of Monte Verde, the Bourbon governor, had little difficulty in defeating the dispirited forces of Miranda, and on July 26 the general capitulated on condition that he should be deported to the United States. The condition was not observed; Miranda was moved from dungeon to dungeon, and died in 1816 at Cadiz.

There are allusions to Miranda’s early life in nearly all memoirs of the time, but they are not generally very accurate. For his trial see Bûchez et Roux, Histoire Parlementaire, xxvii. 26-70. For his later life see Biggs, History of Miranda's Attempt in South America, London, 1809; and Veggasi, Revolucion de la Columbia.
