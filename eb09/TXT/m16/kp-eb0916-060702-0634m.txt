MÖHLER, Johann Adam (1796-1838), Roman Catholic theologian, was born at the village of Igersheim in Wurtemberg on 6th May 1796, and, after studying philosophy and theology in the Lyceum at Ellwangen, entered the Wilhelmstift in the university of Tübingen in 1817. Ordained to the priesthood in 1819, he was appointed to a curacy at Riedlingen, but speedily returned as “repetent” to Tübingen, where he became privat-docent in 1822, extraordinary professor of theology in 1826, and ordinary in 1828. The controversies excited by his Symbolik (1832) proved so unpleasant that in 1835 he accepted a call to the university of Munich. In 1838 he was appointed to the deanery of Würzburg, but died shortly afterwards (12th April 1838).

Möhler wrote Die Einheit in der Kirche (Tübingen, 1825); Athanasius der Grosse u. d. Kirche seiner Zeit im Kampfe m. d. Arianismus (2 vols., Mainz, 1827); Symbolik, oder Darstellung der dogmatischen Gegensätze der Katholiken u. Protestanten nach ihren öffentlichen Bckenntnissschriften (Mainz, 1832; 8th ed., 1871-72; Eng. transi, by J. B. Robertson, 1843); and New Untersuchungen der Lehrgegensätze zwischen den Katholiken u. Protestanten (1834). His Gesammelte Schriften u. Aufsätze were edited by Döllinger in 1839; his Patrologie by Reithmayr, also in 1839; and a Biographie by Wörner was published at Ratisbon in 1866. It is with the Symbolik that his name is chiefly associated; the interest excited by it in Protestant circles is shown by the fact that within two years of its appearance it had elicited three replies of considerable importance, those namely of Baur, Marheineke, and Nitzsch. But, although characterized by abundant learning and acuteness, as well as by considerable breadth of spiritual sympathy, and thus a stimulative and suggestive work, it cannot be said to have been accepted by Catholics themselves as embodying an accurate objective view of the actual doctrine of their church. The liberal school of thought of which Möhler was a prominent exponent was discouraged in official circles, while Protestants, on the other hand, complain that the author has failed to grasp the vast significance of the Reformation as a great movement in the spiritual history of mankind, while expending needless pains on an exposition of the doctrinal shortcomings, inconsistencies, and contradictions of the individuals who were its leaders.
