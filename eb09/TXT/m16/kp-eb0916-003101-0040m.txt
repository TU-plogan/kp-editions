MERCURY was the Roman god who presided over barter, trade, and all commercial dealings. His nature is probably more intelligible and simple than that of any other Roman deity. His very name, which is connected with merx, mercator, &c., shows that he is the god of merchandise and the patron of merchants. In the native Italian states no merchants and no trade existed till the influence of the Greek colonies on the coast introduced Greek customs into the cities of the land. All the usages and terminology of trade, and all the religious ceremonies connected with it, were borrowed by the Romans from the Greeks. It was no doubt under the rule of the Tarquins, when the prosperity of the state and its intercourse with the outer world were so much increased, that merchants began to ply their trade in Rome. Doubtless the merchants practised their religious ceremonies from the first, but their god Mercurius was not officially recognized by the state till the year 495 b.c. Rome frequently suffered from scarcity of corn during the unsettled times that followed the expulsion of the Tarquins. Various religious innovations were made to propitiate the gods; in 496 the Greek worship of Demeter, Dionysus, and Persephone was established in the city (see Liber), and in 495 the Greek god Hermes (q.v.) was introduced into Rome under the Italian name of Mercurius (Livy, ii. 21, 27). Preller thinks that at the same time the trade in corn was regulated by law, and a regular college of merchants was instituted. This collegium was under the protection of the god; their annual festival was on the Ides of May, on which day the temple of the god had been dedicated at the southern end of the circus maximus, near the Aven tine; and the members were called mercuriales as well as mercatores. The Ides of May was chosen as the feast of Mercury, obviously because Maia was the mother of Hermes, i.e., of Mercury (see Maia); and she was worshipped along with her son by the mercuriales on this day. According to Preller, this religious foundation had a political object; it established on a legitimate and sure basis the trade between Rome and the Greek colonies of the coast, whereas formerly this trade had been exposed to the capricious interference of the Government officials for the year. Like all borrowed religions in Rome, it must have retained the rites and the terminology of its Greek original (Festus, p. 257). Mercury became the god, not only of the mercatores and of the corn trade, but of buying and selling in general; and it appears that, at least in the streets where shops were common, little chapels and images of the god were erected. There was a spring dedicated to Mercury between his temple and the Porta Capena ; every shopman drew water from this spring on the Ides of May, and sprinkled it with a laurel twig over his head and over his goods, at the same time entreating Mercury to remove from his head and his goods the guilt of all his deceits (Ovid, Fasti, v. 673 sq. y ). The art of the Roman tradesman was evidently like that of an Oriental tradesman in modern times, and the word mercurialis was popularly used as equivalent to “cheat.” In the Latin poets Mercury is often gifted with some of the manifold characters of the Greek Hermes, but this finer conception seems to have had no real existence in Roman religion.

Roman statuettes of bronze, in which Mercury is represented, like the Greek Hermes, standing holding the caduceus in the one hand and a purse in the other, are exceedingly common. The caduceus must have been introduced as a symbol of Mercury at a very early time, for it is found on Italian coins as early as the 4th century before Christ, and we learn that several were kept as sacred objects in the adytum of the sanctuary at Lavinium (Dion. Hal., i. 67). But its foreign origin is shown by the fact that, although it was a sign of peace, it was never borne by the fetiales, the old Italian heralds. The very name is derived from the Greek κ∙ηpυκeιov. Preller’s view (Röm. Myth.) that mercuriales and mercatores are the same guild is a tempting one, but its truth is very doubtful. Mommsen thinks that mercuriales were a purely local guild, viz., the pagani of the Circus valley.
