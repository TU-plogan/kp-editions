MOLESKIN is a stout heavy cotton fabric of leathery consistence woven as a satin twill on a strong warp. It is finished generally either as a bleached white or as a slaty drab colour, but occasionally it is printed in imitation of tweed patterns. Being an exceedingly durable and economical texture, it was formerly much more worn by workingmen, especially outdoor labourers, than is now the case. It is also used for gun-cases, carriage-covers, and several purposes in which a fabric capable of resisting rough usage is desireable.
