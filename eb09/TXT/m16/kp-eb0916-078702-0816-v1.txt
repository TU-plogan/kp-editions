MONTFAUCON, Bernard de (1655-1741), critic and scholar, was born of a noble and ancient family at the chateau of Soulage (now Soulatgé, in the department of Aube, France), on 13th January 1655. Though destined for the army, he passed most of his time in the library of the castle of Roquetaillade (the usual residence of his family), devouring books in different languages and on almost every variety of subject, his studies being directed by a learned friend of his father, Pavilion, bishop of Aleth. In 1672 he entered the army, and in the two following years served as a volunteer in Germany under Turenne. But ill-health and the death of his parents brought him back to his studious life, and in 1675 he entered the cloister of the Congregation of St Maur, at La Daurade, Toulouse, taking the vows there on 13th May 1676. Apart from his vast literary labours, the remainder of his life presents little to record. He lived successively at various abbeys — at Sorèze, where he specially studied Greek and examined the numerous MSS. of the convent library, at La Grasse, and at Bordeaux; and in 1687 he was removed to Saint Germain des Prés. From 1698 to 1701 he lived in Italy, chiefly in Rome. Returning to Saint Germain, he was made a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres in 1719. He died on 21st December 1741.

His first publication, in which he was assisted by Lopin and Pouget, was the first volume of a never completed series of previously unpublished Analecta Graeca (1688). In 1690 appeared his defence of the literally historical character of the book of Judith. Athanasii opera omnia, still the best edition of that father, was issued with a biography and critical notes in 1698. The first-fruits of his visit to Italy were seen in his copious Diarium Italicum, sive monumentorum veterum, bibliothecarum, musaeorum, <tc., notitiae singulares in itinerario Italico collectae (1702). The Palseographia Graeca, sive de ortu et progressu literarum Graecarum, et de variis omnium saeculorum scriptionis Graecae generibus (1708) is a standard work, which has not yet been superseded; in its own field it is as original as the De re diplomatica of Mabillon. In 1713 Montfaucon edited Hcxaplorum 0rigenis quae supersunt (2 vols, fol.), only recently superseded by the work of Field; and between 1718 and 1738 he completed his edition of Joannis Chrysostomi opera omnia (13 vols, fol.), which is hardly an improvement upon that of H. Saville. His I.'Antiquité expliquée et représentée en figures (10 vols, fol., 1719) would of itself suffice to establish a reputation for colossal diligence. It was continued by him in Les Monumens de la Monarchie Françoise (5 vols, fol., 1729-1733). A complete list of his literary labours, including his numerous contributions to the Mémoires of the Academy of Inscription⅝ will be found in the Nouvelle Biographie Générale, s.v. “Montfaucon.”
