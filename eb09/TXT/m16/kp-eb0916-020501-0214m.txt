MEUSE, Maese, or Maas, a river of France, Belgium, and Holland, discharging into the North Sea or German Ocean, has a course (variously measured) of some 500 or 550 miles, about 300 miles lying within France. Rising in the department of Haute-Marne (1342 feet), at a point where the plateau of Langres borders on the Monts Faucilles, it follows a winding course, first from south to north, then to north-west, and afterwards to north, across the departments of Vosges, Meuse, and Ardennes, passing by Neuf chateau, Vaucouleurs, Commercy, St Mihiel, Verdun, Sedan, Mézières, and Givet. Naturally navigable below Verdun, it has been made so from Troussey, where it meets the canal which unites the Marne to the Rhine, and from this point to Liège it admits vessels of from 6 to 7 feet draught. After traversing a wide valley covered by green meadows, the Meuse, below Mézières, flows through narrow gorges confined between rocky walls 200 or 300 feet high, formed by the plateau of the Ardennes. The hills of the Argonne, by which it is hemmed in on its upper course, prevent its receiving any important affluent before the Chiers and the Semoy, which both fall into it on the right in the Ardennes. At the point where it leaves France its ordinary volume is about 1000 cubic feet. In Belgium it runs picturesquely between the districts of Famenne and Condroz on the right, and those of Les Fagnes and Hesbaye on the left. Above Dinant it receives the Lesse, whose valley is celebrated for its wonderful grottoes, and at the foot of the citadel of Namur it is joined on the left by its principal affluent, the Sambre, whose north-easterly direction it takes. It then takes its course through the busy valley in which Huy, Seraing, and Liege are situated, receiving the Ourthe on its right. Resuming a northerly direction, then taking one to the north-west, and finally one to the west, the Meuse passes in front of the Dutch citadel of Maestricht to Roermonde, so called from its confluence there with the Roer, and to Venlo, where the canal between the Meuse and the Scheldt begins. Flowing thence through an absolutely unbroken plain, it finally joins the Rhine, to which it gives its own name, although the volume of its waters is twenty times less than that of the German river. It is at Gorcum that the Waal, the first separate arm of the Rhine, brings to the Meuse two-thirds of the waters of that river. The Meuse soon after divides into two branches. While the Merwede flows due west, the southern arm falls into the Biesbosch, an estuary of the sea, formed four hundred and fifty years ago by an irruption of the sea over a country then cultivated and thickly peopled, and now the subject of attempts at reclamation. On reaching Dordrecht, where the river navigation and sea navigation meet, and where the rafts which come down from the Black Forest are broken up, the Meuse again divides into two arms. The Old Meuse flows due west, while the northern arm joins the Lek, a second branch of the Rhine, and continues its course to Rotterdam. This is the most important branch of the estuary of the Meuse, and efforts are being made to regulate and deepen its channel by constructing one of those grand canals in which the Dutch are so skilful. Schiedam and Vlardingen, both on the right, are the last places of importance on the banks of the river.
