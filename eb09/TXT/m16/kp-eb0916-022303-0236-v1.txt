MEZZOFANTI, Giuseppe (1774-1849), cardinal, whose colloquial linguistic acquirements have become proverbial, was born, Septembér 17, 1774, at Bologna, where his father followed the occupation of a carpenter. Educated first at one of the “scuole pie,” and afterwards at the episcopal seminary of his native city, he was ordained to the priesthood in 1797, and in the same year became professor of Arabic in the university, but shortly afterwards was deprived on account of his refusal to take the oath of allegiance to the Government of the Cisalpine Republic. In 1803, however, he was appointed assistant librarian of the institute of Bologna, and soon afterwards was reinstated as professor of Oriental languages and of Greek. The chair was suppressed by the viceroy in 1808, but again rehabilitated on the restoration of Pius VII. in 1814, and continued to be held by Mezzofanti until his removal from Bologna to Rome in 1831, when he received certain ecclesiastical appointments and the rank of monsignore. Meanwhile his progress in the acquirement of languages had been rapid and untiring, and in 1833 he was appointed to succeed Mai as chief keeper of the Vatican Library. His promotion to the cardinalate, and the duties of director of studies in the Congregation of the Propaganda, followed in 1838. He died at Rome, during the absence of the pontifical court at Gaeta, on March 15, 1849.

Mezzofanti’s peculiar talent, comparable in many respects to that of the numerous “calculating boys” who have been the wonder of their contemporaries, was not combined with any exceptional measure of intellectual power, and accordingly produced nothing that has not perished with him. It seems to be well established, however, that he spoke with considerable fluency, and in some cases even with attention to dialectic peculiarities, some fifty or sixty languages of the most widely separated families, besides having a less perfect acquaintance with many others. See Manavit, Esquisse historique sur le Cardinal Mezzofanti, Paris, 1854: and Russell, Life of the Cardinal Mezzofanti, London, 1857.
