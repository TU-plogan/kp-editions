MESHED (properly Mesh-hed, i.e., “place of martyrdom,” “shrine”), a city of northern Persia, capital of Khorâsân, 472 miles east of Tehrân, 201 miles north-west of Herat, 36° 17' 40” N., 52° 35' 29" E., lies on a plain watered by the Keshaf-rùd, a tributary of the Hefi-nid, and is surrounded by mud walls 4 miles in circumference, with a dry ditch 40 feet deep at some points, which could be flooded from the neighbouring reservoir and watercourses. Within this enclosure is a strong citadel, with good walls 25 feet high, residence of the prince governor of Khorâsân. There are five gates, from one of which, the Bala Khiabân, the Khiabân main street runs right through the city, forming a fine boulevard planted with plane and mulberry trees, and with a stream of dirty water running down its whole length. In the centre is an open parallelogram 160 yards by 75, encircled by double-storied cloisters, and pierced on the long side by a high arched porch leading directly to the great mosque, whose gilded dome rises above the shrine of the famous Imàm Rizâ.^[1. 'Ali Rizâ (or el-Ridâ), the eighth imam of the Shi'a, is the 'Ali ibn Mtisâ from whom the party of Alides had such hopes under the caliphate of Mamùn (see Mohammedanism). He died at Tιis, 818 A.D., and λvas buried by Mamun’s orders in the vicinity of that town beside the grave of Harιin el-Rashid. To the Alides he was a martyr, being believed to have been poisoned by the caliph. Tbn Batûta, who describes both shrines (iii. 77 sq. ), tells how the pious visitors to the shrine of ’ Ali ibn Mιisa used to spurn with their feet the tomb of Rashid. In his time a considerable town had been formed around the shrine under the name of Meshhed el-Ridâ and ultimately the new town eclipsed the older city of Tus. ] The marble tomb of the saint, which is the most venerated spot in the whole of Persia, and yearly visited by from 80,000 to 100,000 pilgrims, is surrounded by a silver railing, and approached by a flight of inlaid marble steps. Eastwick, the only European before O’Donovan who penetrated as far as the parallelogram, describes the mosque as large enough to contain three thousand people. It is flanked by two gilded minarets, one of which, 120 feet high, is extremely beautiful, with an exquisitely carved capital, built by Shah Abbâs. The façade is entirely covered with blue and white enamelled tiles. To the mosque are attached as many as two thousand attendants and retainers of all sorts, including no less than five hundred mollahs. Beyond the dome is Gauhar Shâh’s handsome mosque, surmounted by an immense blue dome, and also flanked by two minarets. In the main street is a public kitchen supported by the enormous revenues of the shrine, where eight hundred devotees are daily supplied with food gratuitously. The only other notable buildings in the place are some colleges and twenty-two caravanserais, one of which is of great size. Meshed does a considerable local and transit trade to the yearly value of about 600,000 tomâns, and its bazaars are always well stocked with silks, velvets, felts, cottons, shawls, carpets, lacquer work, lambskins, hardware, glass, china, and other goods from South Persia, India, Turkestan, and Russia. The European trade is now entirely controlled by Russia, and European manufactured articles are mostly all from that country. The chief manufactures are silk, satin, velvet, and checked-cotton fabrics, carpets, shawls, noted sword blades, shagreen, and turquois jewellery. Within the enclosures are extensive cemeteries far exceeding the local requirements, large numbers of the faithful being brought from all parts of the Shi'a world to be buried in the vicinity of Rizâ’s shrine under the belief that their eternal salvation is thereby ensured.

Some 10 miles west of Meshed is a powder factory, formerly under Colonel Dolmage, where powder of excellent quality is produced. The district, although fertile, does not produce sufficient for the inhabitants, so that much grain has to be imported from Kurdistan and Nishâpùr. The climate is very severe in winter, with much snow; in summer it is less sultry than might be expected, the temperature ranging from 76° F. to 90° or 92° F., and in exceptional years 94° to 98° F. The population is variously estimated at from 45,000 (Connolly) and 60,000 (Ferrier) to 80,000 and 100,000 (Eastwick). The settled residents, exclusive of pilgrims and foreign traders, are estimated by O’Donovan at 50,000.

The main caravan routes from Khiva, Bokhara, Samarkand, and Herat converge at Meshed, whence lines of traffic radiate to Kûchan for the Atrek valley and the Caspian, to Nishâpùr and Bostam for Tehran, to Tabas for Isfahan, to Khaf for Sistân and Kirmân. It thus occupies a position in north-eastern Persia analogous to that of Tabriz in the north-west.
