MORRISTOWN, a city of the United States, county seat of Morris county, New Jersey, lies on the Whippany river, 81 miles from New York by the Morris and Essex division of the Delaware, Lackawanna, and Western Railroad. It was twice the headquarters of the American army during the War of Independence, and Washingtonâ€™s residence, owned by the Washington Association, assisted by the State, is a half-mile to the east. On Whatnong mountain, 3 miles distant, stands the State insane asylum, usually called Morristown Asylum, a vast granite building 1243 feet long, erected in 1874-1875, and capable of accommodating 1000 patients. The population in 1880 was 5418.
