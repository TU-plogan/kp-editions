MONTMORENCY, the name of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, is derived from Montmorency, now in the department of Seine-et-Oise, in the immediate neighbourhood of Enghien and St Denis, and about 9 miles to the north-north-west of Paris. The family, since its first appearance in history in the person of Bouchard or Burchard I., sire de Montmorency in the 10th century, has furnished six constables and twelve marshals of France, several admirals and cardinals, numerous grand officers of the crown and grand masters of various knightly orders, and was declared by Henry IV. to be, after that of the Bourbons, the first house in Europe. Matthieu I., sire de Montmorency, received in 1138 the post of constable, and died in 1160. His first wife was Aline, the natural daughter of Henry I. of England; his second, Adelaide or Alice of Savoy, -widow of Louis VI. and mother of Louis VII. According to Duchesne, he shared the regency of France with Suger, during the absence of the latter king on the second crusade. Matthieu II. had an important share in the victory of Bouvines (1214), and was made grand constable in 1218. During the reign of Louis VIII. (1223-1226) he distinguished himself chiefly in the south of France (Niort, Rochelle, Bordeaux). On the accession of Louis IX. he w*as one of the chief supports of the queenregent Blanche of Castile, and was successful in reducing all the vassals to obedience. He died in 1230. His younger son, Guy, in right of his mother, became head of the house of Montmorency-Laval. Anne de Montmorency (1493-1567), so named, it is said, after his godmother Anne of Brittany, was the first to attain the ducal title. He was born at Chantilly in 1493, and was brought up with the dauphin, afterwards Francis I., whom he followed into Italy in 1515, distinguishing himself especially at Marignano. In 1516 he became governor of Novara; in 1520 he was present at the Field of Cloth of Gold, and afterwards had charge of important negotiations in England. Successful in the defence of Mézières (1521), and as commander of the Swiss troops in the Italian campaign of the same year, he was made marshal of France in 1522, accompanied Francis into Italy in 1524, and was taken prisoner at Pavia in 1525. Released soon afterwards, he was one of the negotiators of the treaty of Madrid, and in 1530 reconducted the king’s sons into France. On the renewal of the war by Charles V.’s invasion of France in 1536, Montmorency compelled the emperor to raise the siege of Marseilles; he afterwards accompanied the king of France into Picardy, and on the termination of the Netherlands campaign marched to the relief of Turin. In 1538, on the ratification of the ten years’ truce, he was rewarded with the office of constable, but in 1541 he fell into disgrace, and did not return to public life until the accession of Henry II. in 1547. In 1548 he repressed the insurrections in the south-west, particularly at Bordeaux, with great severity, and in 154ΟΙ 550 conducted the war in the Boulonnais, negotiating the treaty for the surrender of Boulogne on 24 th March 1550. In 1551 his barony was erected into a duchy. Soon afterwards his armies found employment in the north-east in connexion with the seizure of Metz, Toul, and Verdun by the French king. His attempt to relieve St Quentin issued in his defeat and captivity (10th August 1557), and he did not regain his liberty until the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in 1559. Supplanted in the interval by the Guises, he was treated with coldness by the new king, Francis II., and compelled to give up his mastership of the royal household[9:16:792],—his son, however, being appointed marshal by way of indemnity. On the accession of Charles IX. in 1560 he resumed his offices and dignities, and, uniting with his former enemies, the Guises, played an important part in the Huguenot Avar of 1562. Though the arms of his party were victorious at Dreux, he himself fell into the hands of the enemy, and was not liberated until the treaty of Amboise (19th March 1563). In 1567 he again triumphed at St Denis, but received the death-blow of which he died soon afterwards at Paris. His eldest son, Françoise de Montmorency (1530-1579), was married to Diana, natural daughter of Henry II.; another son, Henri I. de Montmorency (1534-1614), was constable of France from 1593. Henry II. (1595-1632), son of duke Henry I., succeeded to the title in 1614, having previously been raised by Louis XIII. to the office of grand admiral. In 1625 he defeated the French Protestant fleet under Soubise, and seized the islands of Rhé and Oleron, but the jealousy of Richelieu deprived him of the means of following up these advantages. In 1628-1629 he was allowed to command against the duke of Rohan in Languedoc; in 1630 he defeated the Piedmontese, and captured Prince Doria, at Avigliana, and took Saluces. In the same year he was created marshal. In 1632 he joined the party of Gaston, duke of Orleans, and placed himself at the head of the rebel army, which was defeated by Marshal Schomberg at Castelnaudary (1st September 1632); severely wounded, he fell into the enemy’s hands, and, abandoned by Gaston, was executed as a traitor at Toulouse on 30th October. The title passed to his sister Charlotte-Marguerite, princess of Condé.
