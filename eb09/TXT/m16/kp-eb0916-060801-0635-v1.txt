MOIR, David Macbeth (1798-1851), the “Delta” of Blackwood’s Magazine, one of its most popular contributors in its early days, was born at Musselburgh 5th January 1798, and was a physician in active practice there from his manhood to his death (6th July 1851). He seems to have been a man of winning manners and noble integrity of character, and the intrinsic value of his poetry has been in consequence somewhat over-estimated by critics of repute who enjoyed his personal acquaintance. He had no independent vein as a writer of serious verse, and his technical qualities as a poet do not bear examination. But his verses were undoubtedly popular with the readers of the magazine at the time. A collection of them was edited by Thomas Aird in 1852. As a kindly humourist “Delta” had a more original turn. His Autobiography of Mansie Wauch, published separately in 1828, is a Scotch classic. And some of his satirical squibs on passing events were written with great freshness and spirit. His Outlines of the Ancient' History of Medicine (1831) evidence his industry and versatility of talent. His Sketch of the poetical literature of the past Half Century (1851) is more remarkable for the grace of its rhetorical ornaments than for depth or freshness of insight.
