MILLER, William (1781-1849), the founder of an American religious sect holding peculiar millennarian views, was born at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, in 17 81. He received a very imperfect education. In the war of 1812 he served as captain of volunteers on the Canadian frontier. While residing at Low Hampton, N.Y., he began in 1833 publicly to lecture on the subject of the millennium, asserting that the second coming of Christ would take place in about ten years. His doctrines awakened wide interest among certain classes of the community. In 1840 a semi-monthly journal, The Signs of the Times, was started by one of his followers, and two years later the Advent Herald made its appearance. About 1843 the second coming of Christ was expected by as many as 50,000 believers in the doctrines of Miller; and, although the disappointment of their hopes somewhat diminished their numbers, many continued their adherence to his tenets regarding the nature of the millennium. At present the number of Millerites or Adventists is estimated at from 15,000 to 20,000. Miller died at New Hampton, Washington county, N.Y., December 20, 1849.
