MOGHILEFF on the Dniester ( Mohilov), a district town of Russia, situated in the province of Podolia, on the left bank of the Dniester, 87 miles east-south-east of Kamenets-Podolsk, and 43 miles from the Zhmerinka railway junction. It has 18,200 inhabitants, nearly one-half of whom are Jews; the remainder are Little Russians, Poles (1500), and a few Armenians. The Little-Russian inhabitants of Moghileff carry on agriculture, gardening, wine, and mulberry culture. The Jews and Armenians are engaged in a brisk trade with Odessa, to which they send corn, wine, spirits, and timber, floated down from Galicia, as well as with the interior, to which they send manufactured wares imported from Austria.

Moghileff, named in honour of the Moldavian hospodar Mohila, was founded by Count Potocki about the end of the 16th century. Owing to its situation on the highway from Moldavia to the Ukraine, at the passage across the Dnieper, it developed rapidly. For more than 150 years it was disputed by the Cossacks, the Poles, and the Turks. It remained in the hands of the Poles, and was annexed to Russia in 1795. The Crown purchased it from Count Potocki in 1806.
