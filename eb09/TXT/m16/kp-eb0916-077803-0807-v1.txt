MONT-DORE-LES-BAINS, a village of France in the department of Puy de Dôme, 17 miles as the crow flies south-west of Clermont Ferrand, 3432 feet above the sea, On the right bank of the Dordogne not far from its source. The Monts Dore, from which it takes its name, close the valley towards the south; their culminating peak, Puy de Sancy (6188 feet), is the highest eminence of central France. The mineral springs of Mont Dore were known to the Romans. The eight now used yield 94,600 gallons in twenty-four hours. Bicarbonate of soda, iron, and arsenic are the principal ingredients of the water; to the two last it owes its efficacy in cases of pulmonary consumption, bronchitis, asthma, and nervous and rheumatic paralysis. From the elevation and exposure of the valley, which opens to the north and runs up towards mountains never quite free from snow, the climate of Mont-Dore-les-Bains is severe, and the season is consequently short. About 5000 patients visit the place between 15th June and 15th September, when a casino and theatre are opened. The chief building is the solid but sombre bath-house (hot baths). The surrounding country, with its fir woods, pastures, waterfalls, and mountains, is very attractive. In the “park” at Mont-Dore-les-Bains, which forms a little promenade along the Dordogne, relics from the old Roman baths have been collected, but the ancient establishment must have been on a larger scale than the present one. A pantheon erected about the time of Augustus existed till the 16th century. The population in 1881 was 1438.
