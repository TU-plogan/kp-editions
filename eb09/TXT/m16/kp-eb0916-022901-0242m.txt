MICHAUX, François André (1770-1855), son of the preceding, was, like his father, employed by the French Government to explore the forests of North America with a view to the introduction into France of trees valuable for their wood or other products. He was very successful in carrying out this object. He published in 1810-13 a Histoire des Arbres forestières de Γ Amérique Septentrionale, in 3 vols., with 156 plates, a work full of information on the characters, uses, distribution, and other points of interest in the various species. In 1817-19 a translation of it appeared under the title North American Sylva. He also wrote a Voyage a l’ouest des Monts Alléghanys, 1804, besides articles in scientific magazines.
