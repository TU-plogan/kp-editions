MORNAY, Philippe de (1549-1623), Seigneur du Plessis-Marly, very generally known as Mornay Du Plessis or Du Plessis-Mornay, one of the most distinguished members of the Protestant party in France, was born at Buhy in Normandy on 5th November 1549. As a younger son he was destined for the church, and with this view was sent to the Collège de Lisieux in Paris, but in his eleventh year, along with the rest of his family, he abandoned Roman Catholicism, continuing, however, with zeal and success his studies not only in classical and general literature but also in theology. In the autumn of 1567, on the outbreak of the second religious war, he joined the army of Condé, but was prevented from taking an active part in the campaign by a fall from his horse, which broke his leg. In the following year he went abroad, and, after spending the winter at Heidelberg, travelled extensively in Italy, Germany, the Low Countries, and England, learning the languages and acquiring the friendship of many of the distinguished men of all these countries. In [9:16:829] June 1572 he returned to France, and had begun to enter upon a diplomatic career (his earliest extant “mémoire,” laid by Coligny before Charles IX., had reference to the duty of France to support the Low Countries in their struggle for independence) when the St Bartholomew massacre, from which he escaped with difficulty, compelled him to take refuge across the Channel, There he rendered valuable services to William of Orange, and also to the duke of Alençon-Anjou, as a semi-official political agent. Returning to France at the instance of La Noue towards the end of 1573, he took part with various success in numerous military enterprises, and was made prisoner at Dormans in 1575 (10th October), but not having been recognized he got off for a small ransom. Shortly afterwards he married Charlotte Arbaleste at Sedan, and at her request wrote as a bridal present the Discours de la Vie et de la Mort (1576), which has been so often reprinted and translated. In 1577 Henry of Navarre made him a member of his council and sent him on a diplomatic mission to England, and during this visit, which lasted more than a year, he found time among his other pressing occupations to prepare for the press his Traité de l’ Église où Von traite des principales questions qui ont été mues sur ce point en nostre temps (1578), which at once became popular. From July 1578 till his return to France in 1582 he was chiefly in the Low Countries, engaged in public business, and during this interval he wrote and published a considerable work in apologetical theology {Traité de la vérité de la religion chrétienne contre les Athées, Épicuriens, P ay ens, Juifs, etc., 1581). With the death of the duke of Anjou in 1584, by which Henry of Navarre was brought within sight of the throne of France, the period of Mornay’s greatest political activity began; his importance in the Huguenot counsels was further increased in 1588 by the death of the prince of Condé, to whose influence he practically succeeded. In April 1589 he was rewarded for the reconciliation of the two Henries with the governorship of Saumur, and he took active part in many of the military operations that followed the assassination of Henry III. in the following August. He was present at the siege of Dieppe, fought by the side of Henry IV. at Ivry, and was one of the besiegers of Rouen in 1591-92, until sent on a mission to the court of Elizabeth. A crisis in his political career was marked by Henry’s abjuration of Protestantism in July 1593, which gradually led to Mornay’s withdrawal from the court. In this year it was that he founded the Protestant academy or university of Saumur, which had a distinguished history until its suppression by Louis XIV. in 1683. In 1598 he published a work on which he had long been engaged, entitled De Vinstitution, usage, et doctrine du saint sacrement de V Eucharistie en Γ Église ancienne. It having reached his ears that Cardinal Du Perron had alleged that of the (thousands of) citations in this controversial work he could point out five hundred that were falsified or misunderstood, he challenged his assailant to a public discussion. This was at last arranged for by the good offices of the king, and took place at Fontainebleau on 4th May 1600. Only nine passages were discussed, but in each case the decision, one is not surprised in the circumstances to learn, went against the Protestant. Mornay, from whom every indication of the particular passages to be impugned had been persistently withheld, was forced by supervening illness to withdraw. Only once again did he appear at court, in 1607. He continued, however, to give his party the benefit of his counsel and active support to the end of his long and busy life. His last work, entitled Mystère d’iniquité, c’est à dire, l’histoire de la Papauté, appeared in 1611. In 1618 he was chosen a deputy to represent the French Protestants at the synod of Dort. Prohibited by Louis XIII. from personally attending, he nevertheless contributed materially to the deliberations of that assembly by written communications. In 1621 he was deprived of his governorship; and his death took place at La Forêt-sur-Sèvre on 11th November 1623.

Two volumes of Mémoires, from 1572 to 1589, appeared at La Forêt in 1624, and a continuation, in two volumes, at Amsterdam in 1652; a more complete edition (Mémoires, correspondances, et vie) in twelve volumes, 8vo, was published at Paris in 1624-25. The greater number of his works were translated into English during his lifetime.
