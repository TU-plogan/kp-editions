MONACO (French Moneguè), the smallest of the sovereign principalities of Europe, with an area of 8 , 34 square miles, a population (1878) of 7049, and an army of 72 men, is situated on the coast of the Mediterranean, 9 miles east of Nice, and bounded on all sides by the French department of the Maritime Alps. Previous to 1861, when the communes of Mentone (Menton) and Roccabruna (Roquebrun) were sold to France for 4,000,000 francs, the area was about a third larger; but the population, which with those portions again included would now be 15,000, was only about 8000. Monaco has long had the reputation of being one of the most beautiful and sheltered spots on all the Franco-Italian coast: non Corus in ilium Jus habet aut Zephyrus; solus sua littora turbat Circius, said Lucan; and a luxuriant growth of aloes and prickly pears (introduced in 1537), palm-trees, eucalyptus, lemontrees, and geraniums gives a warmer colour to the scene than Lucan can have known. The town occupies the level summit of a rocky headland, rising about 195 feet from the shore, and still surrounded with ramparts. Though largely modernized, the palace is a fine specimen of Renaissance architecture; the new “cathedral” (French Renaissance style), the new church of St Charles, and the museum may also be mentioned. Behind the rock, between Mont Tête de Chien and Mont de la Justice, the high grounds rise towards Turbie, the village on the hill which takes its name from the tropaea with which Augustus marked the boundary between Gaul and Italy. On the eastern side lies the little port or bay of Monaco; along the lower ground, at the head of the bay stretches the village of Condamine with orange-gardens, manufactures of perfumes and liqueurs, and the chapel of Ste Dévote, the patron saint of Monaco; farther to the east, on the rocky slopes of the Spélugues (Speluncae) are grouped the various buildings of the Casino of Monte Carlo and the numerous villas and hotels which it has called into existence. Previous to 1828 the Spélugues were mere barren rocks; but after they were traversed by the new road to Mentone, Count Rey caused them to be covered with soil by Italian convicts; and since 1858, when the first stone of the Casino was laid, the process of artificial embellishment has been carried [9:16:718] out on the most magnificent scale. The gaming establishment is now in the hands of a joint-stock company with a capital of 15,000,000 francs. None of the inhabitants of Monaco have access to the tables; and their interest in the maintenance of the status quo is secured by their complete exemption from taxation, and the large prices paid for their lands. Gambling-tables were set up at Monaco in 1856; but it was not till 1860, when Μ. Blanc, expelled from Homburg, took possession of the place, that Monte Carlo began to be famous.

A temple of Heracles Monoecus was built on the Monaco headland at a very early date, probably by the Greeks of Massilia. Monoeci Portus or Portus Herculis is frequently mentioned by the later Latin writers. From the 10th century the place was associated with the Grimaldi, a powerful Genoese family who held high offices under the republic and the emperors; but not till a much later date did it become their permanent possession and residence. In the beginning of the 14th century it was notorious for its piracies. Charles I. (a man of considerable mark, who, after doing great service by sea and land to Philip of Valois in his English wars, was severely wounded at Crecy) purchased Mentone and Roccabruna, and bought up the claims of the Spinola to Monaco. The princes of Monaco continued true to France till 1524, when Augustin Grimaldi threw in his lot with Charles V. Honoré I., Augustin’s successor, was made marquis of Campagna and count of Canosa, and people as well as rulers were accorded various important privileges. The right to exact toll from vessels passing the port continued to be exercised till the close of the 18th century. Honoré II., who renewed the alliance with France in 1641, was compensated for the loss of Canosa, &c., with the duchy and peerage of Valentinois and various lesser lordships; and duke of Valentinois long continued to be the title of the heir-apparent of the principality. The National Convention annexed the principality to France in 1793; restored to the Goyon Grimaldis by the Treaty of Paris in 1814, it was placed by that of Vienna under the protection of Sardinia. King Albert of Sardinia took the opportunity of disturbances that occurred in 1848 to annex Mentone and Roccabruna; but this high-handed proceeding was condemned by the protocol of 1856, and Charles III. (born 1818) entered upon his full rights. With the transference of Nice to France in 1860 the principality passed again under French protection.
