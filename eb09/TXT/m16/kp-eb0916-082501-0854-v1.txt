MORLAIX, the chief town of an arrondissement in the department of Finistère, France, lies 350 miles west of Paris on the railway from Paris to Brest, and at the confluence of two small streams, 7 miles distant from the sea. Its port has 13 feet of water at ordinary and 23 feet at spring tides. The entrance of the roadstead is defended by the Chateau du Taureau, which stands on a rock in the sea, and was built in 1542 to protect the town from the English. Morlaix still contains a considerable number of curious wooden houses of the 15th, 16th, and 17 th centuries; but the most striking piece of architecture in the town is the gigantic two-storied viaduct of the railway from Paris to Brest, 934 feet long and 207 feet above the quays. The old church of the Dominicans is now occupied by the town library. The hospital has beds for 500 patients, and can accommodate 300 female lunatics besides. A tobacco-factory, employing 400 men and 700 women, is the principal industrial establishment; and there are also extensive paper-mills, a considerable flax-mill, canvas-factories, foundries, and saw-mills. A considerable trade is carried on in grain, yarn, canvas, leather, tallow, wax, and horses; and a large quantity of butter, cattle, and vegetables is exported from Roscoff, a village in the neighbourhood, which is also known for its sea-bathing and its zoological station. The population of Morlaix was 15,183 in 1876.

Judging by the numerous coins found on the spot, the site of Morlaix was probably occupied in the time of the Romans. The counts of Leon held the lordship in the 12th century, but the dukes of Brittany disputed possession with them, and in 1187 Henry II. of England, guardian of Arthur of Brittany, made himself master of the town after a siege of several weeks. During the War of the Hundred Years Morlaix was again captured and recaptured by the French and the English, and pillaged by the latter in 1522. Queen Mary of Scotland, on her way to be married to the Dauphin, made solemn entry into Morlaix in 1548. And finally, the town having joined the League, the castle was taken by storm in the name of Henry IV. in 1594.
