MIZPAH (∏Ξ20) and Mizpeh (∏2> ’ D) are Hebrew words for a “place of prospect,” or high commanding point. The cities of Palestine generally occupied such positions; and so in the Old Testament we find several places bearing the name of “The Mizpah” (Mizpeh). Sometimes a determining genitive is added; “The Mizpeh of Gilead” (Judg. xi. 29), “The Mizpeh of Moab” (1 Sam. xxii. 3).

(1) The most famous of these places is that in Gilead, a noted sanctuary (Judg. xi. 11; Hosea v. 1), claiming consecration from the sacrifice of Jacob (Gen. xxxi. 54) and the masseba or sacred stone erected by him (ver. 45). The narrative of Gen. xxxi. 45 sq. is somewhat obscure, and not all from one hand. We gather, however, from it that another name of “The Mizpah” was Galeed, i.e., Gilead. Thus Mizpah, Mizpeh Gilead, Gilead (Hos. vi. 8), Ramath Mizpeh (i.e., the height of Mizpeh, Josh. xiii. 26), and Ramoth Gilead (the heights of Gilead), or simply The Ramah (2 Kings viii. 28, 29), are almost universally taken to be one place. With this it agrees that Ramoth Gilead was a city of refuge, which points to an early sanctity. The place is prominent throughout the history. It was the seat of Jephthah (Judg. xi. ), the mourning for whose daughter probably gives us a glimpse into the ancient rites of a provincial sanctuary, the residence of one of Solomon’s officers (1 Kings iv. 13), and a hotly disputed frontier city in the wars between Syria and the house of Omri, before which Ahab fell (1 Kings xxii.), and in which the military revolt of Jehu was organized (2 Kings ix. ). Maspha was still a strong place in the Greek period, and was taken by Judas Maccabaeus (1 Mac. v. 35). Eusebius knows Ramoth as a place 15 miles west of Philadelphia or Rabbah of Ammon. It is therefore commonly identified with El-Salt, the modern capital of the Belka; but this cannot be said to be made out. (2) The Benjamite Mizpah or Mizpeh, also a sanctuary, is often named in the history of Samuel. It was a border fortress of King Asa (1 Kings xv. 22), and the residence of Gedaliah as governor of Judaea after the fall of Jerusalem (Jer. xl.). Its old sanctity was still remembered in the Maccabee times, and from 1 Mac. iii. 46 we conclude that it commanded a view of Jerusalem. The most probable identification is with the prominent hill-top of Neby Samwil. There was (3) another Mizpeh in the low country of Judah (Josh. XV. 38), and (4) a land or valley of Mizpeh (Josh. xi. 3, 8) under Mount Hermon.
