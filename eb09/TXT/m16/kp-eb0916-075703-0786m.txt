MONOPOLI, a city of Italy, in the province of Bari, is situated on the coast of the Adriatic, 25 miles by rail south-east of Bari. It is a bishopâ€™s see, is surrounded by ancient walls, and possesses a castle built by Charles V. in 1552, a cathedral, and a hospital dating from 1368. The harbour is neither large nor well protected, but a certain amount of trade is carried on in the export of local products. The population was about 12,000 in the 17th century; 12,377 in 1861; and 13,000 in 1871, that of the commune being 20,918. Monopoli probably grew up after the destruction of Egnatia (5th century), the ruins of which lie a few miles to the south.
