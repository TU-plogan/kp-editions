MOIR, George (1800-1870), author of the treatises on “Poetry” and “Romance” in the seventh edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and born at Aberdeen in 1800, was an Edinburgh lawyer of very varied accomplishments. He was appointed professor of rhetoric in 1835, professor of Scots law in 1864; he had a considerable success at the Scottish Bar, was successively sheriff of Ross and sheriff of Stirling, and was a frequent contributor to Blackwood’s Magazine. Moir honourably maintained the literary traditions of Edinburgh law. He was a man of very wide reading, catholic sympathy, and fastidious taste, alive to very various degrees and kinds of excellence in literature, but too critical and hard to please to do justice to his own wealth of ideas. He died in 1870.
