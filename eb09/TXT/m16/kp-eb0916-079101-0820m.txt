MONTLUC, Blaisede Lasseran-Massencôme, Seigneur de (c. 1503-1577), marshal of France, was born about 1503, at the family seat near Condom in the modern department of Gers. He was the eldest son, and his family was a good one, but it was large and poor, and, like most gentlemen of Gascony, he had to trust for endowment to his sword. He served first as a private archer and man-at-arms in Italy, with Bayard for his captain, fought all through the wars of Francis I., and was knighted on the field of Cérisoles (1538). Having apparently enjoyed no patronage, he was by this time a man of middle age. Thenceforward, however, his merits were recognized by his appointment to various important posts. His chief feat was the famous defence of Siena (1555), which he has told so admirably. When the religious wars broke out in France, Montluc, a staunch royalist, held Guienne for the king, and exercised severe but impartial justice on Catholics and Protestants alike. He would have nothing to do with the Massacre of St Bartholomew. Henry III., however, made him marshal of France, an honour which he had earned by nearly half a century of service and by numerous wounds. He died at Estillac near Agen in 1577. Montluc’s eminence above other soldiers of fortune in his day is due to his Commentaires (Bordeaux, 1592), in which he described his fifty years of service. This book, the “soldier’s Bible” (or “breviary,” according to others), as Henry IV. called it, is one of the most admirable of the many admirable books of memoirs produced by the unlearned gentry of France at that time. It is said to have been dictated, which may possibly account in some degree for the singular vivacity and picturesqueness of the style. Hardly any author excels Montluc in the clearness λvith which he brings military operations before the reader. As with most of his contemporaries, his work is didactic in purpose, and he often pauses to draw morals for the benefit of young commanders, but never tediously. The eloquence displayed in some of the speeches is remarkable. These Commentaires are to be found conveniently in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, but the standard edition is that of the Société de l ’ Histoire de France, edited by Μ. de Ruble (5 vols. 1865-72).
