MONTORO, a town of Spain, in the province of Cordova, 27 miles to the north-north-east of that city, on the Madrid railway, stands on a rocky peninsula on the south bank of the Guadalquivir, here crossed by a fine bridge of four arches dating from the 16th century. Its most conspicuous building is a hospital, said to be one of the best in Andalucia. The most important article of commerce is the oil of the surrounding district. The population of the ayuntamiento was 13,293 in 1878.
