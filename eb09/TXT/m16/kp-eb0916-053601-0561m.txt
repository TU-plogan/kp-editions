MO‘ALLAḲÁT. Al-Mo‘allakcit is the title of a group of seven longish Arabic poems, which have come down to us from the time before Islam. The name signifies “the suspended” (pl.), the traditional explanation being that these poems were hung up by the Arabs on or in the Ka'ba at Mecca. The oldest passage known to the writer where this is stated occurs in the 'Ikd of the Spanish Arab, Ibn 'Abd-Rabbih (a.d. 861-940), Bûlâk ed. vol. iii. p. 116 sq. We read there: “The Arabs had such an interest in poetry, and valued it so highly, that they took seven long pieces selected from the ancient poetry, wrote them in gold on rolls (?) of Coptic cloth, and hung them up Çallakat') on the curtains which covered the Ka'ba. Hence we speak of i the golden poem of Amraalkais, ’ ‘ the golden poem of Zohair. ’ The number of the golden poems is seven; they are also called ‘ the suspended ’ (al-⅛fo l allakaty , Similar statements are frequent in later Arabic works. But against this we have the testimony of a contemporary of Ibn 'Abd-Rabbih, the grammarian Nahhâs (ob. a.d. 949), who says in his commentary on the Mo'allakât: “As for the assertion that they were hung up in [stc] the Ka'ba, it is not known to any of those who have handed down ancient poems.”^[1. Ernst Frenkel, An-Nahhàs' Commentar zur Muallaqa des Imruul∙ Qais (Halle, 1876), p. viii. ] This cautious scholar is unquestionably right in rejecting a story so utterly unauthenticated. The customs of the Arabs before Mohammed are pretty accurately known to us; we have also a mass of information about the affairs of Mecca at the time when the Prophet arose; but no trace of this or anything like it is found in really good and ancient authorities. We hear, indeed, of a Meccan hanging up a spoil of battle on the Ka'ba (Ibn Hishâm, ed. Wüstenfeld, p. 431). Less credible is the story of an important document being deposited in that sanctuary, for this looks like an instance of later usages being transferred to pre-Islamic times. But at all events this is quite a different thing from the hanging up of poetical manuscripts. To account for the disappearance of the Mo'allakât from the Ka'ba we are told, in a passage of late origin (De Sacy, Clιrestom., ii. 480), that they were taken down at the capture of Mecca by the Prophet. But in that case we should expect some hint of the occurrence in the circumstantial biographies of the Prophet, and in the works on the history of Mecca; and we find no such thing. That long poems were written at all at that remote period is improbable in the extreme. All that we know of the diffusion of Arabic poetry, even up to a time when the art of writing had become far more general than it was before the spread of Islam, points exclusively to oral tradition. Moreover, it is quite inconceivable that there should have been either a guild or a private individual of such acknowledged taste, or of such influence, as to bring about a consensus of opinion in favour of certain poems. Think of the mortal offence which the canonization of one poet must have given to his rivals and their tribes! It was quite another thing for an individual to give his own private estimate of the respective merits of two poets who had appealed to him as umpire; or for a number of poets to appear at large gatherings, such as the fair of Okâz, as candidates for the place of honour in the estimation of the throng which listened to their recitations. In short, this legend, so often retailed by later Arabs, and still more frequently by Europeans, must be entirely rejected.^[2. Doubts had already been expressed by various scholars, when Hengstenberg—rigid conservative as he was in theology—openly challenged it; and since then it has been controverted at length in Nöldeke’s Beiträge zur Kenntniss der Poesie der alten Araber (Hanover, 1864), p. xvii. sqq. Our highest authority on Arabic poetry, Professor Ahlwardt, concurs in this conclusion; see his Bemerkungen über die Aechtheit der alten arabischen Gedichte (1872), p. 25 sq. ] The story is a pure fabrication based on the name “suspended.” The word was taken in its literal sense; and as these poems were undoubtedly prized above all others in after times, the same opinion was attributed to “the [ancient] Arabs,” who were supposed to have given effect to their verdict in the way already described. A somewhat simpler version, also given by Nahhâs in the passage already cited, is as follows: “Most of the Arabs were accustomed to meet at Okâz and recite verses; then if the king was pleased with any poem, he said, ‘Hang it up, and preserve it among my treasures.’” But, not to mention other difficulties, there was no king of all the Arabs; and it is hardly probable that any Arabian king attended the fair at Okâz. The story that the poems were written in gold has evidently originated in the name “the golden poems” (literally “the gilded”), a figurative expression for excellence. We must interpret the designation “suspended” on the same principle. In all probability it means those (poems) which have been raised, on account of their value, to a specially honourable position. Another derivative of the same root is l ilk, “precious thing.”

The selection of these seven poems can scarcely have been the work of the ancient Arabs at all. It is much more likely that we owe it to some connoisseur of a later date. Now Nahhâs says expressly in the same passage: “The true view of the matter is this: when Hammâd arrâwiya (Hammâd the Rhapsodist) saw how little men cared for poetry, he collected these seven pieces, urged people to study them, and said to them: ‘ These are the [poems] of renown.’” And this agrees with all our other information. Hammâd (who lived in the first three quarters of the 8th century a.d.) was perhaps of all men the one who knew most Arabic poetry by heart. The recitation of poems was his profession. To such a rhapsodist the task of selection is in every way appropriate; and it may be assumed that he is responsible also for the somewhat fantastic title of “the suspended.”

The collection of Hammâd appears to have consisted of the same seven poems which are found in our modern editions, composed respectively by Amraa⅛ais, Tarafa, Zohair, Labid, 'Antara, 'Amr ibn Kolthιim, and Hârith ibn Hilliza. These are enumerated both by Ibn 'Abd-Rabbih, and, on the authority of the older philologists, by Nahhâs; and all subsequent commentators seem to follow them. We have, however, evidence of the existence, at a very early period, of a slightly different arrangement. Two of the foremost authorities in Arabic poetry are Abù 'Obaida and Mofaddal,—men who for care and accuracy in preserving the genuine text were far ahead of their much older contemporary Hammâd. Both of these inserted a poem by Nâbigha and one by A'shâ in place of those of 'Antara and Hârith;^[3. The passage is cited by Nöldeke, Beiträge, p. xx. sq. ] and, if our informant has expressed [9:16:537] himself correctly, they also called this modified collection Moallakât. Mofaddal employs, besides, the names “the seven long [poems]” and “the necklaces.” This last became afterwards a common title for the seven poems. The comparison of songs to strings of pearls is a very apt one, from the nature of the Arabic poem, composed as it is of separate loosely-connected parts. Hence it became so popular that even in ordinary prose to speak in rhythmical form is called simply nazm, “to string pearls.” Mofaddal expressly opposes the view of those who did not acknowledge the pre-eminence of the seven poets selected by him. This appears to be an attack on HammAd for including in his collection the works of two men who for poetic fame could certainly never enter the lists with NAbigha and A'shA. It is prima facie more likely that a later writer should have replaced the less famous poets by those who were universally placed in the first rank, than vice versa. Perhaps another fact is of some importance here. HammAd, a Persian by descent, was a client of the Arab tribe, Bakr ibn WAil. In the heathen period this tribe was much at war with the closely - related tribe Taghlib. Now of all Arabic poems none was more famous than that in which 'Amr ibn Kolthιim celebrates in glowing terms the praises of his tribe Taghlib. If, therefore, Hammâd’s collection embraced this poem, it was very natural for him to gratify his patrons the Bakrites by placing alongside of it that of HArith—a Bakrite and contemporary of 'Amr—where he extols his own tribe and assails the Taghlibites with bitter scorn. Such considerations did not affect Abù 'Obaida and Mofaddal.

The authority of these men has so far prevailed that the poems of their favourites NAbigha and A'shA often appear in the manuscripts, not indeed instead of those of 'Antara and HArith, but after the other seven. Thus we sometimes read of nine Mo'allakAt. The first author in whom the writer has observed this is the great philosophic historian Ibn Khaldùn (a.d. 1332-1406); he mentions instead of HArith the far more celebrated 'Alkama; whether relying on ancient authority, or by an oversight, we cannot tell. In an excellent collection of forty-nine long poems by Abù Zaid al-Korashi (date unknown) MofaddaΓs seven poets appear in the first class, “the necklaces;” but NAbigha and A'sha are each represented by a different piece from that usually reckoned among the Mo'allakAt. By this editor the name “golden poems,” which, as we have seen, sometimes occurs as a synonym of “Mo'allakAt,” is applied to seven quite distinct songs.^[4. See Noldeke, Beiträge, p. xxi., and the catalogue of the Arabic codd. in the British Museum, p. 480 sqq. ] This uncertainty as to the selection and the titles may serve as an additional proof that the “suspension,” on the Ka'ba or anywhere else, is a fable.

The lives of these seven (or nine) poets were spread over a period of more than a hundred years. The earliest of them, according to the common and probably correct opinion, was Amraalkais (pronounced also Imroolkais, Imraalkais, <fcc.), regarded by many as the most illustrious of Arabian poets. His exact date cannot be determined; but probably the best part of his career fell within the first half of the 6th century. He was a scion of the royal house of the tribe Kinda, which lost all its power at the death of King HArith ibn 'Amr in the year 529.^[5. See Tabari's Geschichte der Perser und Araber . . . übersetzt von Th. Noldeke (Leyden, 1879), p. 171. ] The poet’s royal father, Hojr, by some accounts a son of this HArith, was killed by Bedouins. The son led an adventurous life as a refugee, now with one tribe, now with another, and appears to have died young. The anecdotes related of him—which, however, are very untrustworthy in detail—as well as his poems, imply that the glorious memory of his house and the hatred it inspired were still comparatively fresh, and therefore recent.

The Mo'allaka of 'Amr hurls defiance against the king of Hira, 'Amr son of Mundhir, who reigned from the summer of 554 till 568 or 569, and was afterwards slain by our poet.^[6. See Nöldeke’s Tabari, pp. 170, 172. ] This prince is also addressed by Hârith in his Mo'allaka. Of Tarafa, who is said to have attained no great age, a few satirical verses have been preserved, directed against this same king. This agrees with the fact that a grandson of the Kais ibn KhAlid, mentioned as a rich and influential man in Tarafa’s Mo'allaka (v. 80 or 81), figured at the time of the battle of Dlnι KAr, in which the tribe Bakr routed a Persian army. This battle falls between a.d. 604 and 610 (Nöldeke’s Tabari, p. 311).

The Mo'allaka of 'Antara and that of Zohair contain allusions to the feuds of the kindred tribes 'Abs and DhobyAn. Famous as these contests were, their time cannot be ascertained. But the date of the two poets can be approximately determined from other data. Ka'b, son of Zohair, composed first a satire, and then, in the year 630, a eulogy on the Prophet; another son, Bojair, had begun, somewhat sooner, to celebrate Mohammed. 'Antara killed the grandfather of the Ahnaf ibn Kais who died at an advanced age in a.d. 686 or 687; he outlived 'AbdallAh ibn Simma, whose brother Doraid was a very old man when he fell in battle against the Prophet (early in a.d. 630); and he had communications with Ward, whose son, the poet 'Orwa, may perhaps have survived the flight of Mohammed to Medina. From all these indications we may place the productive period of both poets in the end of the 6th century.^[7. This evidence might be supplemented from a poem in Zohair’s name, whose author describes himself as a man of ninety years, and in which the downfall of King No'mân of Hira (a.d. 601, see Tabari, p. 347) is spoken of as a not very recent event. But the genuineness of this poem is more than doubtful (see Ahlwardt, op. tit. p. 64, and C. J. Lyall in the Academy, March 13, 1880, p. 192). ] The historical background of 'Antara’s Mo'allaka seems to lie somewhat earlier than that of Zohair’s.

To the same period appears to belong the poem of 'Alkama, which, as we have seen, Ibn Khaldün reckons amongst the Mo'allakAt. This too is certainly the date of Nabigha, who was one of the most distinguished of Arabic poets. For in the poem often reckoned as a Mo'allaka, as in many others, he addresses himself to the above-named No'mAn, king of Hira, who reigned in the two last decades of the 6th century. The same king is mentioned as a contemporary in one of 'Alkama’s poems.

The poem of A'sha, which Mofaddal placed among the Mo'allakAt, contains an allusion to the battle of I)lιιi KAr (under the name “Battle of Hinw,” v. 62). This poet, not less famous than NAbigha, lived to compose a poem in honour of Mohammed, and died not long before a.d. 630.

Labi , d is the only one of these poets who embraced Islam. His Mo'allaka, however, like almost all his other poetical works, belongs to the pagan period. He is said to have lived till 661 or even later; certainly it is true of him, what is asserted with less likelihood of several others of these poets, that he lived to a ripe old age.

We have already mentioned that the old Arabic poetry was transmitted not by manuscripts but simply through oral tradition. Many pieces, especially the shorter ones, may have owed their preservation to their hold on the popular memory. But, fortunately, there was a class of men who made it their special business to learn by rote, and repeat, the works either of a single poet or of several. The poets themselves used the services of such rhapsodists (rdwιs). The last representative of this class is HammAd, the man who formed the collection of Mo'allakAt: but he, at the same time, marks the transition from [9:16:538] the rhapsodist to the critic and scholar. Now, when we consider that more than a century—in some cases two centuries—elapsed before the poems were fixed by literary men, we must be prepared to find that they have not retained their original form unaltered. The most favourable opinion of the rhapsodists would require us to make allowance for occasional mistakes; expressions would be interchanged, the order of verses disarranged, passages omitted, and probably portions of different poems pieced together. The loose structure of the ancient poems rendered them peculiarly liable to corruptions of this kind. But the fact is that Hammàd in particular dealt in the most arbitrary fashion with the enormous quantity of poetry which he professed to know thoroughly. He is even charged with falsifications of all sorts in this department. Of others, again—and notably of the great philologist Khalaf, “the Red ”—it is credibly reported that they used their intimate knowledge of the style and language of the ancients to pass off whole poems of their own making as the productions of earlier authors. The worst anticipations are only too completely confirmed by an examination of such pieces as are still preserved, as is shown most conclusively in Ahlwardt’s Bemerkungen, already cited. The seven Mo'allakât are indeed free from the suspicion of forgery, but even in them verses are frequently transposed; in all there are lacunae; and probably all contain verses which do not belong to them. Some of them have more than one introduction. This is the case even with the poem of 'Amr, although, as the finest panegyric of his very powerful tribe, it must have had a wide circulation. The true introduction begins at v. 9; before that we find another which certainly does not belong to this poem, and can hardly be the work of the same poet. 'Amr lived in the desert regions near the lower Euphrates, under the Persian dominion; whereas the author of v. 8 boasts of his carousals in several parts of Roman Syria, and in v. 1 he speaks of drinking wine from a place in Northern Syria. It is evident that all attempts to restore the original order, to fill up blanks, or to remove interpolations, can only be carried to a certain degree of probability at the best; there must always be a large subjective element in judgments on points of the kind. Still less can we hope to discover and rectify the minor changes, in single expressions or grammatical forms, wifi ch the text may have undergone before it was fixed in writing. It may be remarked in this connexion that where any ancient song has been transmitted through two different grammatical schools it generally appears in two considerably divergent forms, each having been taken down from the lips of a separate râwi. Of secondary importance are the errors due to later copyists. Considerable as these often are, we are, at least in many cases, better able to correct them.

Even the masters of old Arabian poetry do not exhibit such characteristic differences in their general manner and style as to leave in the mind a clear idea of their individuality. A few distinct poetic types emerge, but the great majority of these poets present a somewhat monotonous aspect to the Western scholar, who indeed can at best have but a very imperfect feeling for nuances of style in this field. But if we are thus unable to isolate the various constituent parts of this poetical literature, and pass a critical opinion on each, we do get from this literature, as a whole, what is of far greater importance than an aesthetic estimate of this or that particular poet, viz. a poetic picture of the whole life and activity of that remarkable people which, amid the endless agitation and endless sameness of its existence, and in an extremely inhospitable region, was preparing one of the mightiest revolutions in the history of the world. This collective impression is hardly impaired by the involuntary alterations made by the rAwis; nor is it greatly distorted by the forgers of the 2d century of Islam, who were thoroughly familiar with the spirit and style of antiquity, and seldom did violence to them.

The critics of the 2d and 3d centuries a.h. unanimously ranked the poets of the heathen period above those of Islam; and in that verdict we must concur. The older Moslem poets were for the most part mere Epigoni, content, for better or worse, to borrow the style of their pagan predecessors. It is only natural, therefore, that the seven best poems should have been selected from the productions of heathenism. But how these particular seven came to be fixed upon, it is difficult to decide. It is remarkable that people who knew thousands of such poems should have agreed as to the superiority of five, and only differed about two. No doubt the selection was greatly influenced by the widely-established reputation of certain poets, like Amraalkais, Zohair, and Tarafa; while in other cases single poems, such as that of 'Amr, stood in high repute for special reasons. Still, even we, with a much narrower range of selection, should hardly pick out these seven as the finest. In all probability our choice would not light on a single one of them. The truth is, our aesthetic ideal is essentially different from that of those old litterateurs. And, while we may certainly consider our own taste, formed on the model of the Greeks and the best of the moderns, to be on the whole purer than theirs, we must not forget that they had the advantage of perfect knowledge of the language and the subject-matter, and could thus perceive a multitude of beautiful and delicate touches, which we either miss entirely or realize with laborious effort. The world of the old Arabian poet lay at an infinite remove from ours. His mental horizon was narrow; but within that horizon every minute detail was seized and designated with precision. Among the nomads, for example, the smallest point of the horse or camel that the eye can see has its importance; the language has precise and generally understood words for them all, where ours has only technical terms. It is the same with all the physical properties of the animal—its paces, etc. Thus, when a poet faithfully described the exterior and the deportment of his camel, that was to his hearers—and the same is true of later critics—a genuine pleasure, because the description conveyed to them a definite pictorial impression. But we do not understand the details of the picture; or, when at best with all the resources of tradition and natural history we have gained some tolerable comprehension of them, the whole still leaves us indifferent. A camel to us is simply not a poetical object; and even a horse ceases to be aesthetically interesting—except perhaps to a sportsman—when one is asked to go over his points in detail. For this reason we are apt to find a great part of Tarafa’s Mo'allaka, and many parts of the poems of Amraalkais, viewed as poetry, distasteful rather than interesting. More attractive are the descriptions of the life and habits of wild animals in the desert, such as the wild ass and some species of antelope, which the poets are fond of introducing (see, e.g., the Mo'allaka of Labfd). There are also many vivid sketches from nature to be met with,—nature, of course, as seen in the very monotonous Arabian landscape. Monotony, indeed, is a predominant characteristic of this poetry. When one first reads poems where the bard begins by shedding tears over the scarcely perceptible traces of the dwelling of his beloved in years gone by, one’s sympathy is aroused. But when poem after poem is found to commence with the same scene, and possibly with almost the same words, the emotion is somewhat damped. No doubt such occurrences must really have been very common in the nomad life; nevertheless the suspicion becomes at last irresistible that for the most part all this is pure fiction. Nor can we be sure that the [9:16:539] poets are always to be taken au sérieux when they describe those carousals, and other adventures in peace and war, of which they love to boast. They are probably more serious in the narratives of their love experiences: these are often very highly coloured, and yet are always pervaded by a certain natural refinement, which is too often wanting in the later erotic poetry of the Moslems. But there, too, our enjoyment is frequently marred by minute and even prosy descriptions of the physical charms of the object of affection.

The lyrical and even the more rhetorical passages of the poems make in general a deeper impression upon us than the descriptive portions, to which they owe their distinctive character, and which are often intimately blended with the former. When those old Arabs are really moved by love, or rage, or grief, when personal or tribal vanity vents itself in immoderate boasting, invective, or banter, then they strike chords that thrill our breasts. In those passages where genuine human feeling is stirred, they also display far greater individuality than in the more conventional descriptions. Especially affecting are the numerous passages or complete poems which mourn over the beloved and venerated dead. Their sober practical philosophy too, as it is presented in the Mo'allaka of Zohair and in many of Labid’s poems, is really impressive.

The Mo'allakàt are highly characteristic specimens of this poetry. They exhibit nearly all its merits as well as most of its defects. Amongst its merits we ought, perhaps, to include the unfailing regιdarity of the verse. That a people living under such extremely simple conditions should have cultivated a purely quantitative metre, so euphonious and so rigorously adhered to, is a fact worthy of our highest admiration. It is one evidence of that sense of measure and fixed form which is, in other directions also, a marked feature in the life and speech of the Arabs. The mere fact that in their verses they give so much attention to elegance of expression deserves commendation. Amongst the defects of this poetry we must emphasize the loose connexion between the separate parts. JFe require a poem, like any other work of art, to be a compact unity; the Arabs and many other Orientals lay all the stress on the details. In the Mo'allaka of Tarafa, for instance, after the poet has spoken long enough about his beloved, he starts off in this fashion: “But I banish care when it comes near with a ”— she-camel of such and such qualities, and then proceeds to give a description of his riding-camel. Equally abrupt transitions occur in almost all these poems, generally more than once in the same poem. In many cases a sort of unity is preserved by making the different sections represent so many scenes from the life σf the poet or from the common life of the Bedouins; but even then there is something unsatisfactory in the want of real connexion. It does not mend matters much when the poet keeps up a merely mechanical transition; as, for example, when he speaks first of his camel, then with the words “it is as swift as a wild ass which,” Arc., passes to a description of that animal, and again proceeds, “or as swift as an ostrich which,” Arc., in order to introduce the ostrich.

This loose structure of the poems explains the fact that from a very early period particular pieces were culled from larger works and recited by themselves. For the town-Arabs of later times this procedure was especially convenient. For them the wild ass or oryx-antelope had little attraction; and on the camel they bestowed about as much notice as we do on our dray-horses and waggons. But the love and hate, the pride and scorn, the fierce lust of revenge and the wailing grief, the bravery and the gaiety, which breathed through the old Bedouin songs, had an intense fascination for them. We see that their attitude towards that poetry had in some degree approximated to our own. Hence it is that some anthologies from the old poetry, made by men of learning and ability, with an eye to contemporary tastes, are on the whole much more pleasing to us than the complete poems themselves. This is eminently true of the excellent collection edited by Abιi TammAm, himself a considerable poet (first half of the 9th century), under the title HamAsa (Valour). This collection, which, however, embraces many pieces of the Moslem period, is certainly fitted to give a European a rather too favourable idea of ancient Arabic poetry. Whoever wishes really to know that poetry—and without this knowledge it is impossible to understand the Arabs themselves or their language— must betake himself to those which, like the Mo'allakAt and others, have been preserved more or less in their integrity.

The Mo'allakAt have been repeatedly printed, separately and collectively, both in the West and the East, generally with an Arabic commentary. A good commentary by a competent European is a real desideratum. A work of this kind would do more for the understanding of the poems than any poetical translation, which must always fail in rendering these definite concrete expressions of the Arabs for which we possess neither the idea nor the image. A translation must either be a mere paraphrase or else substitute something utterly vague. (TH. N. )
